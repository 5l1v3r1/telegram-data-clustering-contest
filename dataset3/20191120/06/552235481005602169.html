      <h1>Jack Ross given Hibs European target as Leann Dempster look for long-term improvement</h1>
      <h2>The 32-team 'Europa Conference League' is scheduled to begin in 2021 and the Hibees want to be ready for it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Jack Ross will be expected to have Hibs climbing the Ladbrokes Premiership table, but chief executive Leeann Dempster is thinking longer-term by targeting a new “game changing” European competition.</p>
      <p>UEFA announced in December last year that they planned to introduce third continental competition in addition to the Champions League and Europa League.</p>
      <p>Provisionally named the Europa Conference League or Europa League 2, the 32-team tournament is scheduled to begin in 2021 at the beginning of the next new UEFA cycle, which will run until 2024.</p>
      <p>Matches will be played on Thursday evenings alongside Europa League fixtures.</p>
      <p>The idea is to make European competition more accessible to clubs who maybe currently miss out in the lower profile leagues across Europe. Whether we like it or not, that includes Scotland.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> of course will continue targeting third or fourth place in the Ladbrokes Premiership and the qualification that comes with that.</p>
      <p>However, an extra route in to Europe isn’t to be sniffed at, and getting there is part of the big club mindset that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Dempster</a> believes <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Ross</a> understands after managing Sunderland.</p>
      <p>“We talk about the big club mentality,” she said. “He’s been at Sunderland which is a massive club, so he understands the expectations here.</p>
      <p>“We’re a capital city club with massive rivals and great opportunities to try and continue some of the good work we’ve done.</p>
      <p>“But we want to be better. We want to be ready for the new European competition. People talk about that being 100 years away but it’s not. It’s a few years away.</p>
      <p>“We’re almost at the end of 2019 now. That competition and the opportunity that gives us and other clubs in Scotland, that’s what we want. When it happens, we want to be ready to take advantage of it.</p>
      <p>“The determination when we came in was to get the club promoted. It took longer to do that than we’d have liked.</p>
      <p>“The determination at the minute is to get the club ready for the new competition in Europe and that means finishing in the top three or four in order to be able to participate.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we should shy away from that.</p>

      <p>“A club like Hibernian with the fan base it as and the financial capacity it’s got has to have that aspiration.</p>
      <p>“European competition is a game changer irrespective of what part of the competition you get into.</p>
      <p>“If I understand that (new) competition, and there’s more to come out in terms of how we might participate in that or the Europa League, the opportunity to play more games in Europe is an attractive proposition for us.</p>
      <p>‘That allows us to do that. That has to be an area that ourselves and other clubs in Scotland are aspiring too.</p>
      <p>“The finances in Europe and the platform is gives the club and the players is undoubtedly a game changer.</p>
      <p>“That is why everybody wants to be part of the Champions League. Once you get through to the latter stages that’s a game changer for clubs who participate.</p>
      <p>“Equally if we were able to participate in Europe and get through to a group stage of one of those competitions, the Europa League or the new competition, that would be a massive game changer for us.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>City rivals Hearts will no doubt harbour similar ambitions. Whether their ambition to also appoint Ross as their new head coach matched Hibs’ seems unlikely given how swiftly the Easter Road club made their decision, although it’s understood Ross spoke to both clubs.</p>
      <p>Dempster however, insisted their neighbours being on the hunt for a new boss at the same time didn’t impact their decision making process.</p>
      <p>“It is a unique set of circumstances where both clubs were looking for a head coach at the same time,” she acknowledged</p>
      <p>“But it didn’t drive our timeline or determination any faster or any more.</p>
      <p>“It takes as long as it takes. We weren’t trying to get to the finishing line before anyone else.</p>
      <p>“The clubs are having good conversations on other things.</p>
      <p>“Not having a head coach at a football club, irrespective of what people think, isn’t a comfortable place to be.</p>
      <p>“You really don’t want that to be the case. You really want that person taking the team. So clubs don’t take these decisions lightly.”</p>
