        <b>A town church is hosting its very own Christmas tree festival as part of its attempts to raise £100,000 to save a bell tower and two beautiful stained glass windows.</b>
      </p>
      <p>St Peter’s CE Church is in dire need of funds after its vicar was quoted a repair bill totalling £246,000 for the Chorley institution in Harpers Lane.</p>

      <p>The Reverend Peter Smith explained: “We have an inspection of the church every five years and during that we noticed some damp highlighted by some problems on the windows.</p>
      <p>“The team went up and found that the copper ties on the window had perished and that was how rain was coming in.</p>
      <p>“A specialist has told us they need to come out and they cannot stay fixed on site.”</p>

      <p>“It’s been horrendous,” said Mr Smith.</p>
      <p>“Fund-raising has been going quite slow so the festival was the next step. The community has been good in responding.</p>
      <p>“We had an architect come round and he said the total repair for the building is £246,000 including the belfry and bell tower.</p>
      <p>“The scaffolding alone is horrendous in cost. Just the glass is £28,000 on its own not including scaffolding and painting.</p>

      <p>“Every Victorian church built in the 1850s is in the same position. They need to be kept updated.</p>
      <p>“The current windows have been in place for around 90 years though, so it’s not been a bad run at all.”</p>
      <p>The festival will be open from 1pm until 4pm on Friday, 10am until 4pm on Saturday, and 11.30am until 2pm on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Free parking will be available behind the church.</p>
