      <p>The report, Poverty Britain, will set out the 10 ways in which poverty has risen and living standards have fallen since 2010.</p>
      <p>According to the analysis, <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-03-27/nearly-half-a-million-food-bank-parcels-given-out-in-18-months-figures-show/"><b>food banks have given out 65 million meals in the past five years – enough for one per person in the UK.</b></a></p>
      <p>Labour has committed to halving the number of food bank handouts needed within a year of gaining office.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, under the Tories wages have stagnated – costing the average worker more than £6,000 in the past nine years – and the number of children growing up in relative policy has increased by half a million, according to the party’s findings.</p>
      <p>A United Nations report on UK poverty levels, published in March, predicted overall child poverty rates could reach 40% by 2021 under the current level of decline.</p>
      <p>“For almost one in every two children to be poor in 21st century Britain would not just be a disgrace but a social calamity and an economic disaster rolled into one,” said Professor Philip Alston’s UN report.</p>
      <p>The number of adults with no savings has increased from 17 million to 20 million, while in-work poverty has risen by 1.5 million people, Labour said.</p>

      <p>Mr McDonnell said: “Poverty in Britain is now the most visible and widespread it has been in decades.</p>
      <p>“This new report shows the Tories have failed to tackle 10 modern scourges of poverty, each becoming more entrenched on their watch.</p>
      <p>“The next Labour Government will wage war on poverty in all its forms, eliminating in-work poverty, ending austerity and raising living standards across the country.”</p>
      <p>As well as looking to end food bank use, Labour has vowed to eliminate in-work poverty over the course of a five-year Parliament if Jeremy Corbyn is elected prime minister.</p>
      <p>His administration would put the minimum wage up to £10 for those aged 16 and over, while scrapping Universal Credit, along with the benefit cap and the two-child limit for welfare payments.</p>
      <p>Labour said it would clamp down on problem debt by capping credit card and overdraft repayments so borrowers never repay more in interest than they originally borrowed.</p>
      <p>It has already revealed plans to expand free childcare for those aged two to four and provide universal free school meals for all primary pupils.</p>

      <p>Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey hit back, saying: “Corbyn’s Labour are repeatedly peddling lies and misleading statistics for political gain. This is yet another example in a long list.</p>
      <p>“People are better off in work under this Government and average wages have outpaced inflation for the last 20 months in a row.</p>
      <p>“Our National Living Wage is giving a pay rise for millions of the lowest earners. We have record employment, with 3.7 million jobs created by the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>“In stark contrast, every Labour Government has left office with higher unemployment than when they came in.”</p>
      <p>She added: “Corbyn cannot be trusted and the Conservatives will continue to call out Labour lies."</p>
