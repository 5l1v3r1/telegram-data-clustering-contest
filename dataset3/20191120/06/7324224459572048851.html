      <p>Staff from the human resources and payroll team at Willenhall-based ASSA ABLOY Opening Solutions UK &amp; Ireland are collecting donations of food and toiletries to help families and individuals in need during the festive period.</p>
      <p>Last year, the ASSA ABLOY Portobello site donated £300, which the team used to buy cupboard essentials and festive food filling around 50 boxes.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Senior HR business partner Mani Sandhu said: “ASSA ABLOY Opening Solutions UK &amp; Ireland have supported the Express and Star ‘Feed a Family’ campaign since it started.</p>
      <p>“As ‘Feed a Family’ is a local campaign it is extremely close to all of our employees hearts.</p>
      <p>“All departments come together to support the appeal and year on year donations have increased.”</p>
      <p>With the help of Express &amp; Star readers we are aiming to provide families with Christmas treats they would otherwise not be able to afford, as well as supplying them with store-cupboard essentials to keep them going through the festive season.</p>
      <p>The causes we are supporting this year are the Black Country Food Bank, which has centres across Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall, The Well (Home of Wolverhampton Food Bank), the Good Shepherd Ministry, based in Wolverhampton, and Cannock and District Food Bank.</p>
      <p>We are also collecting chocolate selection boxes for the Haven refuge in Wolverhampton which provides both practical and emotional support services to women and children who are affected by domestic violence and homelessness.</p>
      <p>These can be dropped off at our offices in Queen Street and will be given to youngsters to help spread some much-needed Christmas cheer.</p>
      <p>All of these good causes are helping individuals and families in need every day and have seen numbers needing support continue to rise during the past 12 months..</p>
      <p>The appeal will run until Saturday, December 14 and donations can be taken to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Express &amp; Star Wolverhampton head office</b>, 51-53 Queen Street, Wolverhampton WV1 1ES</li>
        <li><b>Waitrose Wolverhampton</b>, Marston Road, Wolverhampton WV2 4NJ</li>
