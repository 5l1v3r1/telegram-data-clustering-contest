      <p>A mining firm wants to extend its controversial opencast mine in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham.</a></p>
      <p>Banks Mining has lodged plans to extend its operation near Leadgate on land to the west of its Bradley surface mine.</p>
      <p>The firm wants to extract around 90,000 tonnes of coal and 20,000 tonnes of fireclay from 18.5 hectares of land, with the work to be completed by August 2021.</p>
      <p>Work on the open cast mine at Pont Valley, near Consett, started 18 months ago and will see 500,000 tonnes of coal extracted.</p>
      <p>The project has been controversial with campaigners invading the site to protest against the work.</p>
      <p>Gavin Styles, managing director at Banks Mining, said: “The Bradley site has been fully operational for 18 months and we are producing high-quality coal in the safest, most efficient and most responsible way possible which is helping to meet the UK’s continuing need for it for use in a range of essential industries, such as steel, cement and food production.</p>

      <p>“While it was great, for example, to see hundreds of British jobs saved by the recent rescue of British Steel, it is impossible to ignore the facts that coal is an indispensable part of the steel-making process, that it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future and that these jobs depend entirely on the ready availability of suitable coal supplies."</p>
      <p>Mr Styles said around 80% of the UK's need for coal is met through imports from the US and Russia, with the greenhouse gas emissions of importing coals from those countries higher than producing it in the UK.</p>
      <p>He added: “This reliance on imports simply off-shores our environmental responsibilities, results in increases in global greenhouse gas emissions and further distorts the true picture of the UK’s total emissions, which should be measured not just on what we make here, but also on what we buy in from abroad.</p>
      <p>“We can mine, transport to our UK customers and restore our surface mines in North East England with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than are released from just the transportation alone of coal from places like Russia, and we can do so safely while creating well-paid jobs and adding value to both the North East and wider UK economies.”</p>
      <p>There have been protests by campaigners at the site who have said coal mining is noisy, dirty and destroys the ecosystem.</p>
      <p>The activists argue more sustainable jobs could be created by using the land for leisure and tourism, rather than a few temporary jobs created by the opencast mine.</p>
      <p>The Bradley West planning application is expected to be decided by Durham County Council's planning committee next spring.</p>
