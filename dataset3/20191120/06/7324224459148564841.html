      <p>The former world champion is firmly in the corner of Gurjit Kaur Bains, who is hoping to take Walsall South for the Conservatives for the first time in nearly 50 years.</p>
      <p>Ms Kaur Bains met with Khan to discuss the Amir Khan Foundation, a charity he set up to help disadvantaged young people and support emergency disasters.</p>
      <p>She said on Twitter: "Good to catch up and discuss the great work the AK Foundation do for young people using boxing and sports to keep them away from crime.</p>

      <p>"Looking forward to working with you for the good of Walsall!"</p>
      <p>Khan said on Twitter: Lovely to meet Gurjit Kaur Bains today who is standing to be the next MP for Walsall South. Good luck to her on the campaign she will be fantastic for Walsall."</p>
      <p>Khan, who last fought against Billy Dib in Saudi Arabia earlier this year, is thought to be lining up a potential contest with Manny Pacquiao in the new year.</p>
      <p>The Tories last took Walsall South in 1970 under Henry d'Avigdor-Goldsmid.</p>
      <p>The party lost the seat to Labour's Bruce George in 1974 and it has been red ever since.</p>
      <p>Valerie Vaz has been the MP there since 2010. She is defending her seat at this election.</p>
      <p>The other candidates are Paul Harris for the Lib Dems, the Brexit Party's Gary Hughes, John Macefield for the Greens, and independent Akheil Mehboob.</p>
