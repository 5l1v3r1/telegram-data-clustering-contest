      <p>A kids’ football course in Coltness has been pulled following alleged assaults on two coaches.</p>
      <p>NL Leisure’s Street Soccer is for nine to 16-year-olds and encourages young people to improve health and well-being in their communities through football. The pop-up pitch, located in Denholm Drive, attracted a number of youngsters from across the area.</p>
      <p>However, the programme has been moved following an alleged incident last month.</p>
      <p>Sgt Ian Scott, from Wishaw Police Office, said: “Street Soccer in Coltness had been running from September 23 and was due to be a 10 week programme. It was welcomed by councillors, community groups and police.</p>
      <p>“On the night of October 16, a 32-year-old man was involved in a confrontation with two coaches. The confrontation resulted in two members of staff from NL Leisure being assaulted. The man then made threats to return.</p>
      <p>“He was traced nearby and was arrested and held in custody until the following day.”</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old pleaded not guilty to two assaults on two men as well as behaving in a threatening and abusive manner likely to cause fear and alarm.</p>
      <p>A further hearing in the case will be heard in the new year.</p>
      <p>Coltness Community Council chairman John Carr lamented the loss of the scheme.</p>
      <p>“We don’t get much in Coltness so when this programme started it was well attended,” said John.</p>
      <p>“Nights are getting darker and Street Soccer was giving kids the chance to play and learn from the coaches who were showing them new skills.”</p>
      <p>“It’s a disgrace that the alleged actions of one individual have ruined it for everyone.</p>
      <p>“People are really angry about this.”</p>
      <p>The programme is still running at Belhaven Park on Wednesday evenings from 7pm to 9pm until November 25.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for NL Leisure said: “Due to a serious incident involving one individual, we have been forced to relocate our street soccer sessions on Wednesday evenings in Wishaw.</p>
      <p>“We will continue to operate in the Belhaven Park area until the block is complete. The safety of everyone taking part in the sessions is our priority and after discussions with Police Scotland and our partners at the NHS, we have unfortunately had to make this decision.”</p>
