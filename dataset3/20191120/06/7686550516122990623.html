      <h1>Electric car warning after woman and guide dog almost killed</h1>
      <h2>New laws are coming into force next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:48:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:48</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A visually impaired woman has called electric cars 'silent killers' and issued a warning after she and her five-year-old guide dog were almost killed.</p>
      <p>Debra Roffey, 52, and her five-year-old guide dog Crystal were almost hit by a near-silent electric car on the seafront at Paignton, Devon, in November 2017.</p>
      <p>"Electric cars are silent killers. A passer-by grabbed me, pulling me and Crystal out of the way of one," she said.</p>
      <p>"There was no warning. There was no noise and no fumes from an exhaust, so Crystal didn't pick up on the fact there was a car behind us on the seafront pathway. We could have been seriously injured or worse."</p>
      <p>Mrs Roffey, who is married to Philip, 68, has optical atrophy and has 10% vision in her left eye, with her right eye completely blind.</p>
      <p>"I only go outside with Crystal and always put my life in her hands. What happened has definitely damaged my confidence, so something needs to be done," she said.</p>
      <p>She is backing Vision Express's Stop Look Listen campaign, which is emphasising to pedestrians the importance of looking before crossing a road.</p>
      <p>"It is ridiculous that there are so many noiseless electric cars on the road - I've nothing against electric cars but they should all have sound systems so people know they are there," added Mrs Roffey, from Lamerton, Tavistock.</p>
      <p>Vision Express commissioned a survey for Road Safety Week which found one in five people has experienced a collision or near miss with an electric car.</p>
      <p>It also found 76% of people feel unsafe because of quiet electric and hybrid cars.</p>
      <p>There are 250,000 on UK roads, with as many as nine million predicted by 2030.</p>
      <p>A new EU law means new electric and hybrid vehicles must be fitted with an audio signal system and by July 2021 all electric and hybrid vehicles need to have one.</p>
      <p>Dan McGhee, from Vision Express, said: "There could be nine million electric and hybrid cars on the road by 2030 and we know that 85% of adults admit having problems with their vision.</p>
      <p>"With these statistics in mind, we wanted to launch a campaign that drives awareness to the vital "Look" and the importance of maintaining regular eye checks to stay road safe.</p>
      <p>"As part of our research, 70% believe Stop Look Listen is still a relevant road safety message in light of hazards on our roads, so we are encouraging all those who have been putting eye tests off to act now."</p>
      <p>- Vision Express commissioned One Poll to survey 2,000 people between November 12 and 15.</p>
