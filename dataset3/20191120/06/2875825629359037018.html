      <p>Gardai fear a missing man may have been the victim of a gangland hit after a body was found in a burning car.</p>
      <p>As remains were removed from the charred shell of a Toyota Corolla in Lucan, Dublin, yesterday, detectives were trying to establish if they belonged to 42-year-old Wayne Whelan.</p>
      <p>He was last seen on Monday afternoon, just hours before the brutal gangland murder, and officers are trying to trace his movements.</p>
      <p>The dead man is believed to have been meeting someone he trusted when he was killed.</p>
      <p>The scene on Mount Andrew Rise was cordoned off by three Dublin Fire Brigade engines yesterday as a Garda forensic team worked to remove the remains and the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Firefighters had to use cutting equipment on the roof and doors of the car to remove the person.</p>
      <p>Residents said they were shocked by the incident in the quiet estate.</p>
      <p>Mr Whelan survived an attempted hit on his life in September when 10 bullets were fired through his <br/>windscreen, hitting him in the chest, arms and head.</p>

      <p>It happened in Griffeen Glen Park, also in Lucan, and he escaped after crawling out of the driver’s door and fled to a nearby house.</p>
      <p>Previously a source said: “He’s been living in the area for about 13 years and is well-known.</p>
      <p>“Over the last while he was always wearing bulletproof vests and he never went into the park area on his own.”</p>
      <p>Locals said yesterday that although there had been some minor crimes committed in the area recently, it was a quiet cul-de-sac.</p>
      <p>One added: “I’ve been living here eight years, it’s quiet enough. You do see some smaller local incidents, like car break-ins but nothing like this.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t hear anything [at the time it happened]. We had friends tell us after they saw it on the news.</p>
      <p>“It’s very shocking. Murder is totally different to any other type of crime.”</p>
      <p>Another resident, who attended the scene as the flames rose from the car, said that normally “you would hear a pin drop” in the estate.</p>
      <p>They added: “I actually discovered it on social media.</p>
      <p>“My partner got dressed and went around and saw the car in flames and then I came round. I’m here three years and I’ve never heard of an ounce of trouble before.</p>

      <p>“It’s really quiet, there’s a mixture of council houses and private houses.</p>
      <p>“On the way around there it’s quite dark.</p>
      <p>“You don’t expect to see something in an estate like this.”</p>
      <p>Labour candidate for the Dublin Mid-West by-election, Joanna Tuffy, was at the scene and called for an increased Garda presence in the Lucan area.</p>
      <p>She said: “I just think it’s horrific that it could happen in a housing estate where there are families – their children are here and you’d be very frightened for them.</p>
      <p>“There has been a lot of incidents in Lucan in recent years and there needs to be a massive influx of funding for Garda resources.</p>
      <p>“Lucan in general is a quiet area. You don’t expect this to happen anywhere but at the same time it is shocking when you see it happen right next to people’s homes.”</p>
      <p>Fine Gael councillor Emer Higgins said she has been in contact with Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan.</p>
      <p>She added: “What happened in Lucan is absolutely shocking and the local community should rest assured that everything possible is being done to prevent further incidents like this occurring. The Justice Minister has assured me he will keep me up to date on any developments.</p>
      <p>“Gardai are appealing for witnesses or anyone with information to contact them.” Fianna Fail councillor and Shane Moynihan said incidents like this are “unacceptable”.</p>

      <p>He added: “I am very familiar with Mount Andrew where this incident took place.</p>
      <p>“This estate is home to many young families with children. Any crime, but particularly violent crime like this, is unacceptable.</p>
      <p>“We will not tolerate it in our community. My thoughts are with those affected, in particular those in Mount Andrew who have to deal with the shock of what has happened on their doorsteps last night.”</p>
      <p>Gardai are now appealing to the public for any information on the car found at the scene and for any potential witnesses to get in touch.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: “The body has been removed to the Office of the State Pathologist where a postmortem will be carried out by Locum State Pathologist Dr Heidi Okkers. Gardai are appealing to the public for any information in relation to a navy Toyota Corolla 05-CW-2225.</p>
      <p>“This vehicle was sold on November 13 and gardai are seeking information in relation to the movements of this vehicle from then to date.</p>
      <p>“Gardai are also appealing for anyone who may have information, including any road users who travelled in the area on the night of November 18 who may have dash cam footage available, to contact officers in Lucan Garda station on 01 666 7300 or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800 666 111.”</p>
