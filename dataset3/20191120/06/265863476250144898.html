      <p>Is Kim Kardashian ready to file for a divorce from Kanye West? That’s the going rumor on social media and the reports are saying that Kim already has the divorce papers ready to go. According to reports from the National Enquirer, Kanye’s spirituality has become his main focus and sources have told the outlet that they sleep in separate rooms and are living separate lives. The report also says the couple hasn’t had sexual relations for almost a year. Now, Kanye is demanding changes in the home and reports suggest that Kim isn’t down with it.</p>
      <p>The National Enquirer reported the following.</p>
      <blockquote>“Kim and Kanye’s sex life has been nonexistent for at least 12 months!” tattled an insider. “They’re sleeping in separate bedrooms and fallen into a rut where they don’t need or want the physical stuff. At least, Kanye doesn’t, and the last thing Kim will do is beg him to sleep with her.</blockquote>
      <p>The report also says that should Kim file the papers, there would be $600 million at stake. According to the National Enquirer’s source, the only thing keeping Kim Kardashian and Kanye West together is their kids.</p>
