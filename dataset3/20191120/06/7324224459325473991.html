      <p>Leamore Primary School in Walsall held the event on Friday and Eddie Hughes came to meet the parents, students and staff and to join in with a quiz.</p>
      <p>Antonia Thomas, school council coordinator, said: "We were celebrating UK Parliament Week and asked parents to come along and take part in a quiz and we asked Eddie Hughes to come along and he took part in the quiz with the parents and he presented the winning team with their prize.</p>
      <p>"We had to have a tie-break question as two teams had the same scores.</p>
      <p>"He had a look around the school and was introduced to the school council and to members of staff.</p>
      <p>"He also had a chat with the parents and children.</p>
      <p>"Parliament Week happens every year and last year we had the mayor and mayoress of Walsall for the day.</p>
      <p>"The children and staff really enjoyed the visit. They all had fun and the quiz was educational too.</p>
      <p>"It was nice for Eddie Hughes to come and visit and take part in our day."</p>
