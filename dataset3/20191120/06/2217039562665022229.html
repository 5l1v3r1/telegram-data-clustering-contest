        <b>Home-seekers made a rush for bigger Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in the mature estates of Ang Mo Kio and Tampines in a Housing Board sales exercise that ended on Monday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>There were more than 13 first-time applicants for each of the 235 four-room flats in Ang Mo Kio, the biggest unit type in the estate. But the 87 three-room flats were less popular, attracting about only two applicants each.</p>
      <p>It was much the same in Tampines with about 11 bids made for each of the 193 five-room flats and the 218 four-roomers. But the 90 three-room flats drew only three applicants a unit.</p>
      <p>Competition was sparse for bigger flats in the upcoming Tengah town.</p>
      <p>The four- and five-roomers and three-generation flats had about two applicants for each of the units.</p>
      <p>Tengah's three-room units had an application rate of 0.7 - meaning all applicants are likely guaranteed a flat.</p>
      <p>All the two-room flexi flats in the three estates were under-subscribed, with an application rate of 0.1 in Tengah and 0.3 in Ang Mo Kio and Tampines.</p>
      <p>Under the two-room flexi scheme, elderly citizens have the flexibility of choosing the length of lease on their two-room flat. Those aged 55 years old and above can take up a lease of between 15 and 45 years in five-year increments.</p>
      <p>The HDB launched 4,571 new BTO flats for sale last Tuesday in the last and biggest BTO sales exercise for the year.</p>
      <p>Prices, excluding grants, for a four-room flat in Ang Mo Kio start from $451,000.</p>
      <p>A five-roomer in Tampines goes from $508,000.</p>
      <p>The sale exercise also included 3,599 units under the Sale of Balance Flats in 14 mature towns such as Bishan and Clementi and 11 non-mature towns, including Bukit Panjang and Punggol.</p>
      <h3>MORE GRANTS</h3>
      <p>Eligible buyers can tap the new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant of up to $80,000, which has no restrictions on the choice of flat type and location.</p>
      <p>Mr Nicholas Mak, head of research and consultancy at ERA Realty, said: "The raised income ceiling means that more people are now eligible to buy new flats and naturally, these families are going for bigger units.</p>
      <p>"They can afford it and they are also aware that the capital gains on the resale market for big units are larger."</p>
