      <h1>FEMA Looks At Blockchain To Aid Disaster Payouts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:28:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>The United States <a href="https://www.fema.gov/">Federal Emergency Management Agency</a> (FEMA) has revealed that it might look into using blockchain technology to streamline disaster insurance payouts, as well as speed up its response to disasters.</p>
      <p>“The Administrator should create a pilot blockchain-based land/property registry with critical information needed to file an insurance or disaster assistance claim. The Administrator should also partner with the insurance industry to consider making the triggering event a federal disaster declaration, or the buildup to an impending threat or hazard. These steps would allow much more rapid liquidation of an insurance policy, including a ‘disaster dividend,’ or a ‘harm’s way’ claim, which could be used to pay for evacuation-related expenses,” the agency stated in its latest <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1572880188002-31454e3c26dff6922fde9d34cbe19e26/November_2019_NAC_Report_Draft_v5.pdf">National Advisory Draft Report</a> to the FEMA Administrator.</p>
      <p>The report cited disasters, such as Hurricanes Maria in Puerto Rico or Harvey in Texas, where those affected might not have any access to the information needed to file a claim, such as policy documents, land ownership records, personal identification and more. A blockchain-based registry would allow <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/disbursements/2019/deep-dive-natural-disaster-relief-funds/">FEMA</a> to “catalyze cross-sector engagement, and develop technology-enabled use cases that can improve the speed of disaster responses and insurance claim payments, without sacrificing accuracy or increasing the risk of fraud. Furthermore, these types of activities, a veritable Disaster Mitigation Lab, can further enable other technology-powered solutions, such as geo-referencing properties or vulnerable communities, among others.”</p>
      <p>The agency would follow in the footsteps of several companies in the insurance industry that have already utilized blockchain. As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/fema-suggests-blockchain-based-registry-to-improve-disaster-insurance-payouts">Cointelegraph</a> reported, U.K.-based charity organization Oxfam International recently announced that it used its blockchain-based delivery system to get payments to paddy field farmers in Sri Lanka. Earlier this year, the British Virgin Islands partnered with blockchain firm LIFElabs.io to launch an alternative crypto-enabled payment infrastructure for residents across the region.</p>
