      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This week, there were further losses in bitcoin below the $8,200 support area against the US Dollar. BTC extended its decline below the 100 hourly simple moving average and even tested the $8,000 support area.</p>
      <p>A new monthly low was formed near $7,987 and the price is currently correcting higher. It traded above the $8,100 level and tested the $8,150 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the price tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,631 high to $7,987 low. However, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-btc-remains-sell-until-this-changes/">price seems to be facing a strong resistance</a> near the $8,150 and $8,200 levels.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,150 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If there is an upside break above the $8,200 resistance, bitcoin price could recover towards the $8,300 level.</p>
      <p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,631 high to $7,987 low is near the $8,300 area to act as a resistance. The next major resistance is now near the $8,400 level (the previous breakdown support).</p>
      <p>It also coincides with the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,631 high to $7,987 low. An intermediate resistance is near $8,360 and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $8,000 area. If there is a daily close below $8,000, the price could even break the $7,800 support. Besides, the next key support is near the $7,400 level (as discussed in yesterday’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-medium-term-outlook-here-is-why-btc-could-test-6-5k/">medium term outlook using the daily chart</a>).</p>
