      <p>Hundreds in a huge crowd at the 60,000-seat Bahir Dar stadium ran on to the field at full-time to salute an Ethiopian side composed of 10 home-based footballers plus one who plays in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast, twice African champions and 95 places higher than Ethiopia in the world rankings, made a great start with Tottenham Hotspur defender Serge Aurier scoring on four minutes.</p>
      <p>But the Group K match turned dramatically midway through the opening half with Surafel Dagnachew and Shimelis Bekele scoring in a 10-minute purple patch.</p>

      <p>The Ivorians introduced French Ligue 1 midfielder Victorien Angban in the second half as they sought an equaliser, but Ethiopia held firm to collect maximum points.</p>
      <p>While the 1,800-metre (5,905 feet) altitude was a disadvantage for a visiting side, the unusually cool weather in the northern city would have suited them.</p>
      <p>In the same group, Madagascar shook off difficult preparations to crush Niger in 39 degrees celsius (103 fahrenheit) heat.</p>
      <p>The national stadium in Niamey has a bone-hard pitch, but that was no obstacle to the Indian Ocean islanders as they recovered from conceding an early goal to lead 6-1 after 65 minutes.</p>
      <p>Amadou Wonkoye gave Niger a lead that lasted just four minutes before Lalaina Nomenjanahary levelled and the France-based Malagasy scored again to trigger the romp.</p>
      <p>Madagascar were the surprise side of the 2019 Cup of Nations in Egypt, stunning Nigeria and eliminating the Democratic Republic of Congo before bowing to Tunisia in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>– Travel difficulties –</p>
      <p>After beating Ethiopia in Antananarivo last Saturday, Madagascar coach Nicolas Dupuis, his staff, the players and officials had to travel to Niger in two groups.</p>
      <p>Like most African national teams, Madagascar cannot afford to charter a jet, and many airlines are unable to accommodate a full delegation in one flight.</p>
      <p>Limited training time add to the challenges facing Dupuis, who was recently rewarded with a four-year contract extension after the unexpectedly successful campaign in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Niger have suffered worse home humiliations, in the same stadium in Niamey 50 years ago they lost 9-1 to Ghana, the record away victory in a Cup of Nations qualifier.</p>
      <p>Madagascar top the table with six points, Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast have three each and Niger are pointless.</p>
      <p>Morocco and Mauritania share the lead in Group E as they followed up their 0-0 draw in Rabat last Friday with matchday two victories.</p>
      <p>Achraf Hakimi, on loan to Borussia Dortmund from Real Madrid and a full-back with a fondness for goals, completed the scoring as Morocco outplayed Burundi 3-0 in Bujumbura.</p>
      <p>Mauritania left it late to seal a 2-0 win over the Central African Republic in Nouakchott with Diallo Guidileye doubling the lead one minute into stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Zimbabwe star Khama Billiat answered critics of his recent international form by scoring both goals in a 2-1 Group H win over neighbours Zambia in Lusaka.</p>
      <p>Group J pacesetters Tunisia edged Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in Malabo with former Premier League forward Wahbi Khazri scoring the lone goal 16 minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Libya rose from last to second in the same section by shading Tanzania 2-1 with giant Anis Saltou snatching the 81st-minute winner in a match moved to Tunisia for security reasons. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7703809/Ethiopia-shock-Ivory-Coast-six-goal-Madagascar-hammer-Niger.html"><b>AFP</b></a></p>
