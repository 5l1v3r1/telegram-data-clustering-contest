      <p>LaCamera is now in charge of all Army forces in the Indo-Pacific. In addition to Hawaii, this includes bases in Japan, South Korea, Alaska, Washington State, and Guam.</p>
      <p>The new general shared his vision for the future of his soldiers under his command.</p>
      <p>“Just like our current fight, our next one will be joint, inter-agency, and coalition. Our alliance and partnerships are necessary and provides us the access, presence and influence required to win in competition and conflict,” Gen. LaCamera said.</p>
      <p>LaCamera has been with the Army for nearly 35 years serving in multiple infantry divisions and a special operations command.</p>
      <p>He replaces General Robert Brown who retired in September after 38 years of service.</p>
