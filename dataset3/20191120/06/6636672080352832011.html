      <p>This is the email about the cuts which WeWork chairman Marcelo Claure  (pictured) sent to staff on Monday:</p>
      <p>WeWork Team,</p>
      <p>This coming week is an important one in the future of WeWork. We are marking our 10th anniversary since WeWork broke ground and started what was nothing short of a reinvention of the way people work, and we are just getting started.</p>
      <p>We will need a more efficient, more focused and even more customer-centric organization to grow and continue to help our members change the way they work, and meet their needs. That requires changing WeWork’s team to match our customer-centric priority.</p>
      <p>As I said at our last All Company Meeting, in the areas of the business that do not directly support our core business goals, we have to make some necessary job eliminations. This is difficult, especially given the energy and commitment so many have contributed.</p>
      <p>But it is necessary and we are taking steps to provide support and implement these actions in a way that respects and recognizes our colleagues’ service.</p>
      <p>Through this process, which will start in earnest this week in the U.S., we are going to eliminate and scale back certain functions and responsibilities, which will increase efficiency and also accountability.</p>
      <p>These actions will make us stronger and better able to generate even more opportunities over the coming months and years.</p>
      <p>In fact, we have been hard at work defining our immediate next steps to shape the future of WeWork, and I am looking forward to sharing those with you directly at the All Company Meeting that we had originally scheduled for tomorrow.</p>
      <p>On further reflection and out of respect for the people who will be separated this week, we are rescheduling our All Company Meeting to Friday at 10:00 a.m. New York time. I apologize for the late notice and any inconvenience.</p>
      <p>Marcelo</p>
