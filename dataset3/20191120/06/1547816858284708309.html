      </p>
      <p>Birthdays can be really special for the birthday girl or boy, plus, the one who organizes a birthday celebration for the person goes all out-and-about to make this day as special as they can. Guess, even Sushmita Sen who ringed in her 44th birthday on November 19 had the same kind of birthday this year. Her boyfriend organized a birthday surprise for his lady that not only left her surprised but completely overwhelmed. While Bollywood celebs usually have a big birthday bash, former Miss Universe had a cosy and mushy birthday surprise on the terrace which was all done by her babe Rohman.</p>
      <p>For the party, he decorated the terrace with lights, balloons, tent, yummy cake and heartfelt notes suspended all over. Recently, Sushmita shared a few videos on her Instagram handle to show us her ‘all heart’ birthday celebration that was done by Rohman and it is simply adorable! While sharing the video, she wrote a long note, which read,” What a magical #birthday EVERYTHING I COULD’VE WISHED FOR &amp; MORE. Thank you jaan @rohmanshawl for this ALL HEART Birthday Surprise!!! I love you, Everyone acted sooooo well...I really had no idea!!! And there it was...a magical terrace with lights, balloons, tent, yummy cake &amp; heartfelt notes suspended all over...”</p>

      <p>Earlier, Rohman posted a heart-warming post about Sushmita on her birthday where he calls Sush the light of his life. He was going to write paragraphs about the lady but he is awestruck and speechless and hence he wrote a small note on her which simply melted our heart. His post read, “Just as the rising sun brings light to the world,you my love, bring light to my life !! Truth be told, i wanted to write paragraphs about you on this special day, but hey, when i think about you i am just as awestruck &amp; speechless as i was, when i saw you sitting there while taking this picture!! </p>
