      <h1>US, China among 10 nations that are far off climate targets for 2030: UN</h1>

      <p>The world's major fossil fuel producers are set to bust global environmental goals with excessive coal, oil and gas extraction in the next decade, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/united-nations">United Nations </a>and research groups said on Wednesday in the latest warning over climate crisis.</p>
      <p>The 10 nations in focus, including superpowers China and the United States, plan to produce fuels by 2030 at levels between 50-120% over Paris Agreement targets, the study showed.</p>
      <p>Under that 2015 global pact, nations committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature increase to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p>
      <p>But by 2030, the 10 countries' planned production would lead to 39 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide emissions, 53% higher than what is needed to reduce temperature rises to 2C and 21 Gt, or 120%, more than is needed for 1.5C, the report said.</p>
      <p>Other countries analysed included Russia, India, Australia, Indonesia, Canada, Germany, Norway and Britain.</p>
      <p>"The world's energy supply remains dominated by coal, oil and gas, driving emission levels that are inconsistent with climate goals," said <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/united-nations">United Nations </a>Environment Programme (UNEP) executive director Inger Andersen.</p>
      <p>As well as UNEP, the report was produced by the Stockholm Environment Institute, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Institute for Sustainable Development, the Overseas Development Institute, and the CICERO Centre for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/international">International </a>Climate and Environmental Research and Climate Analytics.</p>
      <p>It created a new metric called "the fossil fuel production gap" highlighting the difference between rising production and the decline needed to restrict global warming.</p>
      <p>The gap was largest for coal, with countries planning to produce 150% more in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 2C, and 280% more than would limit warming to 1.5C.</p>
      <p>"The continued expansion of fossil fuel production - and the widening of the global production gap - is underpinned by a combination of ambitious national plans, government subsidies to producers, and other forms of public finance," the report said.</p>
      <p>The report precedes UNEP's annual "emissions gap" report, due next week, which assesses whether countries' emissions cut policies are enough.</p>
