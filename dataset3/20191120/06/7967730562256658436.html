      <h1>Pakistan's spell doesn't work in Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:34:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">Greg Baum</a></address>
      <p>In the tumult of activity on Wednesday as the Gabba readied itself for its Test match, it emerged that one of Pakistanis had advised of a change to the spelling of his name. But which one, and to what? For broadcasters and scoreboard operators, the matter was urgent.</p>
      <p>Who, and what? It is the question that applies whenever Pakistan visits, more than to any other touring team.</p>

      <p>Once, a player called up late was interviewed by phone by an Australian journalist at Hong Kong airport en route. Done, he asked the journalist to let the captain know he was coming. Pre-internet, pre-mobiles, it is not so improbable as it sounds. But it tells a tale. We're never sure of what we're getting. Nor, sometimes, are they. They are the disorientals.</p>
      <p>This time, we might have expected, for instance, two brilliant left-arm quicks, Mohammad Amir and Wahab Riaz. They did come, but only for three T20s, a flash in the plan. Did you see them? Nor did I. It transpires that both are retired from red-ball cricket. Amir is all of 27.</p>
      <p>In their place are three teenage tearaways. Here's more of the Pakistan puzzle. From barren ground, they produce fast bowlers, prodigiously and precociously, while their subcontinental neighbours strain in vain. Ten years playing as exiles seems scarcely to have disrupted the succession. All we can say is, thank God for Partition.</p>
      <p>Naseem Shah is 16, or as one press box veteran put it on Wednesday, identifies as 16. He has captured Australia's imagination. From the provinces, Naseem caught the eye of a friend of national captain Azhar Ali while bowling in his street shoes on a visit to Lahore. A phone call followed.</p>
      <p>Mitch Johnson has a similar tale to tell, but it took nine years. It's taken Naseem nine months. That's Pakistan for you.</p>
      <p>Even as the cricketers of the world live more in one another's pockets (and all in India's pocket), Pakistan still spring surprises. Tim Paine says Australia have been doing their homework. He probably means Google.</p>
      <p>It was ever thus. Pakistani cricketers, as beheld from the western hemisphere anyway, come from nowhere, but make memorable impressions.</p>
      <p>Imperturbable Majid Khan, the lavishly gifted Zaheer Abbas, majestic Imran Khan, the indivisible Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, feisty Javed Miandad, crafty Abdul Qadir, the imperious Inzamam-ul-Haq and exotic Shoaib Akhtar all come vividly to mind, and is from a quick trawl of this one reporter's memory.</p>
      <p>We didn't always know how to spell their names at first, but we fell under their spells. Now there's Babar Azam, and, who knows. Naseem Shah.</p>
      <p>But behind this cavalcade, a more sober truth obtains: Pakistan can't win here. You won't read or hear this in the usual guff, but they can't even get close. Of 35 Tests in Australia, they've won four. Since 1981, they've won one, a dead rubber. If Australia sometimes finds the subcontinent inscrutable, Pakistan finds Australia insuperable.</p>
      <blockquote>Their last visit here was typical. In the first Test at this very Gabba, they were set 490 – and very nearly got them.</blockquote>
      <p>Oh, they lose with Pakistani panache. Their last visit here was typical. In the first Test at this very Gabba, they were set 490 – and very nearly got them. In the second, weather and Azhar's double century meant Australia did not get in until the third day, but on the fifth, Pakistan crumbled.</p>
      <p>By the third at the SCG, the Pakistanis were through. David Warner (remember him?) made a century before lunch on day one and Matt Renshaw and Peter Handscomb (remember them?) centuries after lunch and soon it was 3-0, a whitewash.</p>
      <p>Applied to matches and series, the pattern is consistent: a bright beginning, then a falling away. The exception to prove the rule was the 1992 World Cup here, when Pakistan was nearly eliminated, then blithely won it. As only Pakistan could. Soon afterwards, they got a team uniform.</p>
      <p>Australia has Google, Pakistan a manifesto from a former coach of both countries, Mickey Arthur. For batsmen, it's be decisive. For bowlers, it's pitch up, using the short ball only as an occasional jigger. For fieldsmen, especially slips and gully, it's take the catches, a chronic failing on previous visits. Pakistan have a coach just for this.</p>

      <p>Is all lost? Perhaps not. Consider that out there beside Pakistan on Thursday will be another team about whom, Ashes heroics notwithstanding, we're not sure what to expect. For this match, the selectors have gone back to the tried and ... re-tried. It's that sort of era.</p>
      <p>But Australia must be doing something right: after a year in Coventry, not to mention a week in Derby, politicians are beginning to attach themselves to them once again. How good is a photo opportunity!</p>
