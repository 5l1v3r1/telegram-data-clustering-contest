      <p>SAN ANTONIO â€” The Transportation Security Administration says you can pack a cooked turkey in your carry-on luggage!</p>
      <p>On its website, the TSA provides tips to help travelers make it to their Thanksgiving destination safely, even those who are providing Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
      <p>The site says that along with a cooked turkey, stuffing, side dishes, and desserts are also allowed in carry-on luggage.</p>
      <p>"Just make sure that any dishes containing liquids follow the 3-1-1 rule," the TSA states on its website. Same goes for canned cranberry sauce.</p>
      <p>What about alcohol? Any holiday wine must go in your checked luggage.</p>
      <p>"You can pack as many alcoholic beverages as you want as long as they contain less than 24% alcohol. However, passengers toting alcoholic beverages containing 24% to 70% alcohol can only bring a total of 5 liters of alcohol and they should be in their original unopened packaging."</p>
