        <b>The number of children who've been prescribed psychiatric medication has increased by nearly 500% over the past decade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>1,150 people under 15 years of age were prescribed these medicines under the medical card scheme in 2009.</p>
      <p>But this rose to just under 6,500 children last year, according to details released to <i>Newstalk</i> under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Brexit and the NHS were among the major focuses of the first UK general election debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The British prime minister said the Labour leader's claim that the health service would be on the table in such negotiations was an "absolute invention" and "completely untrue".</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, accused Mr Johnson of conducting "secret meetings" with Washington about the NHS and a future trade deal.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <b>A man in his 60s died in a crash in Co Sligo yesterday evening.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It happened in Carraroe at about 7pm, when a Jeep and a van collided.</p>
      <p>The driver of the Jeep died at the scene, while the lorry driver received non-life threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <b>40% of smokers in Ireland made an attempt to quit in the last year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The figure is contained in the latest Healthy Ireland survey, which gives a snapshot into the nation's health each year.</p>
      <p>It shows 17% of people smoke, down from 20% last year - with the numbers highest among those aged between 25 and 34, unemployed people and those living in deprived areas.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>
        <b>25 people have been discovered in a lorry on a UK-bound ferry, according to Dutch authorities.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police say they were found by crew on a ship shortly after it set sail from Vlaardingen.</p>
      <p>It's believed they were in a refrigerated container.</p>
      <p>Two people have been taken to hospital, while the remaining 23 are now in a police facility.</p>
