      <p><b>DAYTON, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - A federal judge is expected to hear a proposed plea agreement in the case of the friend of the gunman in the deadly Dayton mass shooting.</p>
      <p>Court documents show 24-year-old Ethan Kollie plans to plead guilty Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Details of his plea agreement haven't been disclosed. He is accused of lying on a federal firearms form and possessing a gun while using illegal drugs. The gun was unrelated to the Dayton shooting.</p>
      <p>Attorney Nick Gounaris (goo-NAIR'-is) said Tuesday he will ask that Kollie be released pending sentencing.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said there's no indication Kollie knew Connor Betts was planning the Aug. 4 shooting that killed nine people before police killed Betts.</p>
      <p>Investigators said Kollie told them he bought body armor, a 100-round magazine and a part for Betts' gun.</p>
