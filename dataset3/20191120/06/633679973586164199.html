      <p>A waste collector stumbled upon their bodies on sand dunes near Suncoast Casino on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Muhammad's bag was found on the scene with some of her belongings and ID still inside.</p>
      <p>Durban Mayor, Mxolisi Kaunda says they'll increase police patrols and fast-track the installation of security cameras at beaches along the Golden Mile.</p>
      <p>He urged police to work around the clock to find the suspects.</p>
      <p>"One of the issues we have prioritized as the municipality is to increase police visibility and installation of CCTV cameras in our tourist attraction areas so that we can be able to identify wanted suspects and people who plan and commit a crime in these areas," said Kaunda.</p>
      <p>Kaunda says the deaths occurred as the city has been preparing for the festive season influx.</p>
