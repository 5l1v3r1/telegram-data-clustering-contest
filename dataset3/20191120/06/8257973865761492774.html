      <p>"Preliminary reports do not indicate it was caused by enemy fire," U.S. Forces Afghanistan said in<a href="https://rs.nato.int/news-center/news-releases/2019-news-releases/two-us-service-members-killed-in-afghanistan-4.aspx"> a brief statement</a>.</p>
      <p>The cause of the crash is under investigation, it said, adding that the identities of the service members were being withheld for 24 hours until next of kin has been notified.</p>
      <p>These are the first reported deaths of U.S. service members in Afghanistan since Sept. 16 when Sgt. 1st Class <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/09/18/Pentagon-identifies-Green-Beret-killed-in-Afghanistan/9501568782953/?upi_ss=%22Jeremy+W.+Griffin%22">Jeremy W. Griffin</a> was killed by small arms fire while engaged in combat operations in Wardak Province.</p>
      <p>Over 2,400 U.S. service members have died in the Middle Eastern country since the war started in 2001 following the 9/11 attacks.</p>
      <p>There are approximately 13,000 U.S. troops currently stationed in Afghanistan.</p>
