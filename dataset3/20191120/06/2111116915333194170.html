      <p>Samsung W20 5G has been <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/a-new-samsung-foldable-phone-could-launch-before-the-motorola-razr">unveiled in China</a> and is the second foldable by the company. It’s not very different than the Galaxy Fold, which has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/samsung-galaxy-fold-finally-launches-in-india-priced-at-rs-164999">started rolling out</a> to global markets and is the first foldable to hit most markets.</p>
      <p>China Telecom teased the Samsung W20 as an upcoming foldable smartphone with 5G capabilities. Many expected it to be an entirely new device but is just a minor bump up from the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/reviews/samsung-galaxy-fold">Galaxy Fold</a>. The most significant change comes with 5G abilities on the W20 and supports China Telecom’s and China Unicorn’s non-standard 5G deployments.</p>
      <p>When the Galaxy Fold originally came out, it was marred with quality control issues and had to be recalled and redesigned to make it more durable. The <a href="https://www.samsung.com/cn/smartphones/samsung-w20-5g/">Samsung W20 5G</a> takes that a step further, with a thicker and stronger middle frame, which now comes in a new white finish. The edges also have a little sharper this time around. </p>

      <p>The rest of the changes are internal, with the new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/snapdragon-855">Snapdragon 855+ SoC</a> powering the W20, along with 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 512GB of UFS 3.0 storage. The battery is rated at 4,235 mAh and implements the same dual-cell battery, as seen on the Galaxy Fold (which had a 4,380 mAh battery). Fast wired and wireless charging, as well as reverse wireless charging support, is still present. </p>
      <p>Other specifications remain unchanged with a 4.6-inch HD+ display on the outside and a 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Dynamic AMOLED display with a resolution of 2,152 x 1,536 on the inside that can be unfolded. AKG tuned speakers are on either side of this display, which also supports Dolby Atmos.</p>
      <p>The camera setup is the same, too, with a total of six cameras around the W20, starting with three on the back, two on the inside and one on the front. The triple-camera array consists of a 12MP primary camera with an f/1.5-2.4 lens, a 16MP ultrawide lens, and a 12MP 2x telephoto lens. In the notch on the foldable screen is a 10MP f/1.9 selfie camera along with an 8MP depth sensor. The outer cover has the same 10MP camera.</p>
      <p>The Samsung W20 5G will be available in China starting December. The final retail pricing will be announced at the time of availability.</p>
