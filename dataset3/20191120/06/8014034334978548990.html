      <p>PULLMAN, Wash. — A team of amateur botanists is combing parts of the Pacific Northwest in search of long-lost apple varieties.</p>
      <p>The non-profit Lost Apple Project hopes to rediscover varieties of apples long thought to be extinct that may still be growing in forgotten orchards.</p>
      <p>Most of the apples they have found in eastern Washington and northern Idaho were planted by white settlers who moved west in the mid- to late-1800s.</p>
      <p>So far, David Benscoter and E.J. Brandt have found 13 long-lost apple varieties and taken cuttings so they can be cloned and grown once more for future generations.</p>
      <p>But the two are racing against time. The apple trees are a century or more old and are dying. And in other cases, old orchards are being ripped out for farming and development.</p>
