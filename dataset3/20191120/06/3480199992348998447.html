      <p>It is an organisation I feel hugely passionate about – because it replaces passion with credible research.</p>
      <p>I have carved a career as a rural surveyor serving rural estates, farming and commercial clients, I am facilitator of the recently set up River Worfe Catchment Farmer Cluster, which aims to achieve farmer-led conservation on a landscape scale, and also I host let days at Hatton Grange estate.</p>
      <p>The GWCT has spent the past seven decades building very good research which demonstrates how sustainable game management is best for wildlife, with managed shoots showing a net biodiversity gain.</p>
      <p>However comprehensive and dependable research carries a cost, and while Shropshire currently enjoys a rich field sports heritage, we need to grow membership to safeguard the countryside and its field sports for the next generation. So if you are not a member we need you, and if you are, encourage your friends to join.</p>
      <p>Meantime our thanks must go to retiring chairman, Tim Main, who raised more than £100,000 during his tenure.</p>
