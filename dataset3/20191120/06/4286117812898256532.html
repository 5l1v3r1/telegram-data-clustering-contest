      <p>An activist, identified as Zory Bhathena, who is representing the petitioners in the Aarey Tree Cutting (Metro car shed) case claimed that a substantial number of trees planted by the MMRCL, where tree cover was affected during the work of Metro 3 project, are already dead.</p>
      <p>The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) is set to submit its detailed report on the trees planted in Aarey and Sanjay Gandhi National Park.</p>
      <p>Talking to India Today TV, the activist Zoru Bhatena said that he was shocked to see the shoddy work done by the authorities.</p>
      <p>"It is extremely distressing to see the rows of dead trees transplanted by Metro 3. It is sad to see that our government has technology to build a state-of-the-art Metro, but none to save a tree. Building a Metro and saving the tree cover can always go hand in hand. It never needs to be a fight for one over the other. Very sad that our government is least bothered about the tree cover. Very sad," he said.</p>
      <p>The committee is carrying out a three-day inspection of the sites all over Mumbai. Among others there are two officers from the High Court along with the MMRCL staff and the petitioner in the case carrying the rounds.</p>
      <p>The committee, as reports suggest, on Tuesday found that 684 of the 1,066 transplanted trees have died. MMRCL during the work of Metro 3 (Colaba to Andheri) had uprooted more than 1500 trees that were hurdle in the path of the project. These were transplanted at various locations all over the city.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the Watchdog Foundation Godfrey Pamenta said, "The transplanted trees by MMRCL at Aarey were not well tended. No experts were involved to advice MMRCL as to how to take care of the transplanted trees. The trees were left to fend for themselves. I have seen that some places ornamental stones were placed around the transplanted trees in Aarey instead of taking care of trees. MMRCL was only interested in showcasing the trees."</p>
      <p>Response from MMRCL was still awaited till the time of publishing the story.</p>
