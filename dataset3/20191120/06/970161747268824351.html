      <p>A paedophile who was released by mistake is back in prison after he was caught by a father on a bus.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/paedophile-valerijs-gordijs-run-hull-prison-hunted-police-11180608/">Yesterday we ran a police appeal</a> about Valerijs Gordijs who was wanted after being let out by accident while serving a sentence for sex offences against children.</p>
      <p>He was spotted by Graham Lamb, 45, who performed a citizen’s arrest after recognising him thanks to that appeal then posed for a selfie with him.</p>
      <p>Graham said: ‘He got on and I thought “t can’t be. It can’t be that much of a coincidence”, but he was right in front of me.</p>
      <p>‘I was checking Facebook and it popped up saying convicted paedophile was out of prison, and he was right in front of me on the bus.</p>

      <p>Police had warned people not to approach Gordijs, 46, but Graham said he couldn’t just sit back and let him go free.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I said to the bus driver it was him and that she needed to stop the bus so I could ring the police.</p>
      <p>‘I showed her the picture and he looked at the phone and tried getting off the bus so I went after him. He tried to avoid me so I said “stay there” and I rang the police.</p>
      <p>‘I was ready to grab him and pin him down but I did not need to. He was only a small guy and would not have put up much of a fight.</p>

      <p>‘As soon as I said “stay there” he had a worried look on his face. He had the same scar above his left eye. I knew it was him.</p>
      <p>‘As soon as the bus pulled away there was a police car right next to it so I flagged it down.</p>
      <p>‘He deserves to be back in prison and I am glad that he is off the streets and is no longer a danger to anyone else or any other children.’</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Justice said: ‘Releases in error are very rare but we take them extremely seriously and are working closely with police to bring offenders back into custody quickly.’</p>

      <p>A Humberside Police spokesman added: ‘Following our media appeal, Valerijs Gordijs was located on Hessle Road this morning. He was arrested and will be returned to prison.</p>
      <p>‘We want to thank everyone who shared our appeal.’</p>
