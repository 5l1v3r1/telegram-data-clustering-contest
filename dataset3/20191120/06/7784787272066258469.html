      <h3>Hawthorn has orchestrated a clever pre-draft trade that helps the club avoid a potentially sticky draft situation and ensures its gun father-son prospect will don a brown and gold jumper in 2020.</h3>
      <p>The AFL on Wednesday afternoon confirmed a third pick swap between clubs had been lodged in three days, with the Hawks and North Melbourne striking a deal.</p>
      <p>Hawthorn gave up Pick 30 to the Kangaroos, but acquired the latter’s future second-round selection, as well as Picks 50 and 73.</p>

      <p>The Hawks are understood to be keen to move their 2020 first-round selection into this year’s draft pool to complement their current Pick 11.</p>
      <p>But until Wednesday, they’d been hamstrung due to tight AFL regulations, which prohibit clubs from trading out their future first-round pick unless they have second, third, fourth and fifth-round future selections at their disposal.</p>
      <p>Also, clubs can’t trade their second to fifth-round selections unless they replenish their first-round selection.</p>

      <p>But with Hawthorn now receiving the Roos’ 2020 second-round selection, it offsets the loss of their own future second-round pick, which was traded to Melbourne as part of the Sam Frost deal last month.</p>
      <p>Hawthorn now has full a full book of second to fifth-round 2020 selections, meaning they can trade their future first.</p>
      <p>It now means the Hawks could have two selections before a bid comes on father-son prospect Finn Maginness, who’s the son of dual premiership Hawk Scott Maginness. A bid on the Sandringham Dragons midfielder is tipped to come in the later stages of the first round or the early part of the second round.</p>
      <p>The addition of the later draft selections, courtesy of the Kangaroos, means the Hawks should have no issues matching a rival club’s bid on Maginness.</p>
      <p>The Hawks are now armed with over Picks 42, 50, 54, 63 and 73, which equates to 1009 points according to the AFL draft index. That means if a bid on Maginness comes at Pick 13 or later, the Hawks will be able to cover the value cost, thanks to the 20 per cent discount for matching father-son/academy prospects.</p>

      <p>“We feel like this pick swap strengthens our position in both this year and next year’s draft,” Hawks football boss Graham Wright said.</p>
      <p>“We now look forward to next week’s drafts.”</p>
      <p>As for North Melbourne, it now holds three picks inside the top 30 of this year’s draft (Picks 26, 27 and 30), as well as another selection at Pick 47.</p>
      <p>And with just spots left on North’s primary list for 2020, club recruiting manager Mark Finnigan said it was a no-brainer deal to strike with Hawthorn.</p>
      <p>“By having two first-round selections next year already, we had the ability to trade out our future second pick, and strengthen our hand this year,” Finnigan said.</p>
      <p>“With such an even draft this year, we’re confident we can bring in three high-quality players within the first 30 selections.”</p>
      <p>The Hawks-Kangaroos trade is the third one that’s been lodged between the end of the exchange period and the national draft.</p>

      <p>Adelaide and the Giants struck a deal that saw the latter move up to Pick 4 in the draft, which will likely allow the Giants to pick up another gun draftee before being forced to match a bid for their academy gun Tom Green, who’ll likely be called at around Pick 5 or 6. The Crows moved down the draft order two spots, but gained the Giants’ future first-round pick.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Port gained an extra first-round selection in this year’s draft in a deal with Brisbane, who gained a future first-round selection from the Power.</p>
      <p>Clubs can continue to trade picks until November 22.</p>
