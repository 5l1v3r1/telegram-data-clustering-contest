      <h1>Lehto wonders about Brazil GP 'conspiracy theory'</h1>
      <h2>Former F1 driver <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jj-lehto/"><b>JJ Lehto</b></a> has raised a potential "conspiracy theory" in the wake of last Sunday's Brazilian GP.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:56:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:56</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>Although the late-race incidents involving the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> drivers, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-hamilton/"><b>Lewis Hamilton</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-albon/"><b>Alex Albon</b></a> were decisive, Finn Lehto thinks there could be more behind the historic Honda-powered one-two.</p>
      <p>"Remember that Mercedes has already won both championships so there's no need for them to win," he told Iltalehti newspaper.</p>
      <p>"That could mean they reduced the power and the others then look good.</p>
      <p>"I was definitely expecting Hamilton to get a better exit out of the last corner with fresh tyres, take the slipstream and easily pass Gasly."</p>
      <p>As it happened, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/toro-rosso/"><b>Toro Rosso</b></a> driver Gasly's Honda power unit even managed to pull away from Hamilton's title-winning car.</p>
      <p>"Hamilton's pace was really sluggish at the end. The fact that Toro Rosso was faster was really surprising. Could there be a conspiracy theory in there?" he wondered.</p>
      <p>At any rate, Lehto said it is good that the four engine manufacturers in F1 - Ferrari, Mercedes, Honda and Renault - are clearly no longer separated by much.</p>
      <p>"It's great that they have all made significant improvements - Honda in particular have made a big leap forward. The situation has levelled out," he said.</p>
      <p>"Every manufacturer has found more power, driveability and reliability. That's a good sign for next season."</p>
