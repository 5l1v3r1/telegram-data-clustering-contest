      <h1>Ramsey leads Wales to Euro 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:17:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:17</time> by <a rel="author">COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES</a></address>
      <p>Wales reached their second straight European Championship finals after a goal in each half by midfielder Aaron Ramsey gave them a 2-0 home win over Hungary in their decisive Group E qualifier on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Welsh, who reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals, finished runners-up on 14 points from eight games, three behind Croatia who sealed their berth on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Having previously gone 58 years without reaching a major tournament after the 1958 World Cup, there were joyous scenes at the Cardiff City Stadium as Wales produced a dominant display to wrap up qualification.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a triumph for manager Ryan Giggs, who never kicked a ball at a World Cup or European Championship as a player but can now revel in guiding his country to Euro 2020 after taking over from Chris Coleman in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United winger Giggs, who won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies with the club, was delighted.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't get any better, it's amazing," Giggs was quoted as saying by the BBC.</p>
      <p>"From where we were in the summer, all credit to the lads for coming back. One of the best days of my life."</p>
      <p>
        <b>PERFECT BELGIUM</b>
      </p>
      <p>On the final night of qualifying, top-ranked Belgium completed a perfect campaign in Group I by thrashing Cyprus 6-1 for a 10th straight win.</p>
      <p>Christian Benteke and Kevin De Bruyne both scored twice, with Yannick Carrasco also on the score sheet and Christoforou Kypros scoring an own goal.</p>
      <p>Belgium was the most prolific team that qualified, scoring 40 goals from 15 different players. Roberto Martinez's side also conceded just three goals.</p>
      <p>Russia beat San Marino 5-0 and finished second, with its only losses coming against Belgium.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BIG WINS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Germany and the Netherlands were already assured of advancing from Group C and they both finished with big home wins.</p>
      <p>Serge Gnabry scored a hat trick and Leon Goretzka added two more for Germany in its 6-1 win over Northern Ireland in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Georginio Wijnaldum, standing in as captain, also scored three goals in the Netherlands' 5-0 victory over Estonia.</p>
      <p>Germany topped the group, two points ahead of the Dutch.</p>
