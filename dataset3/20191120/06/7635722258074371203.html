      <h1>Jose Mourinho is the new manager of Tottenham Hotspur</h1>

        <b>Tottenham Hotspur have moved quickly to appoint Portuguese Jose Mourinho as their new manager, replacing Mauricio Pochettino. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho has been given a contract at the new White Hart Lane until the end of the 2022/23 season.</p>
      <p>He had been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United in December of last year.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has won 20 major trophies, including three Premier League titles with Chelsea and the Champions League with both Porto and Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>Pochettinho was shown the door last night after five and a half years in charge.</p>
      <p>It followed a run of poor results that see Tottenham lie 14th in the Premier League table. The Argentine guided Spurs to their first-ever Champions League final back in June.</p>
      <p>Tottenham Chairman Daniel Levy has said:</p>
      <p>“In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has said:</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
