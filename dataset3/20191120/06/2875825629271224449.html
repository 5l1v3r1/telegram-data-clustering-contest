      <h1>Comedian Pat Shortt says he is keeping a close eye on his health after deaths of several close friends</h1>
      <h2>The Tipperary funnyman says he is at an age where he 'has to look after himself'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Gallagher</a></address>
      <p>Pat Shortt has ditched the party lifestyle to take better care of his health after the deaths of several close friends recently.</p>
      <p>The comedy star, 51, said he has dumped the cigarettes for regular check-ups in an effort to keep on top of his health as he gets older.</p>
      <p>Speaking just after Mrs Brown’s Boys star Brendan O’Carroll opened up about his health scare last year, Shortt said the news – along with the tragic passing of friends in the industry such as Brendan Grace recently – have made him more conscious of his own well-being.</p>
      <p>When asked if they served as a wake-up call, he joked to the Irish Mirror: “No, no, look when I go I go. I’ll drink away and ate away.”</p>
      <p>The Tipperary funnyman, who lives in Limerick with his wife and three kids, then added: “No of course I do. I look after myself and I get regular check-ups.</p>
      <p>“I have a great GP and every time I go to her for a sniffle or anything she’s sticking needles in me and taking bloods and checking everything out so you know, I’m over 50.</p>
      <p>“So I’m at that age where you have to start looking after yourself, I gave up cigarettes a couple of years ago and that brought on a little bit of asthma so I am kind of keeping an eye on that as well with doctors but nothing major.</p>

      <p>“I’m relatively fit and stuff but I am also conscious that a few friends of mine have passed and have struggled with serious illness so I am aware of it and you have to be, I think you have to be.</p>
      <p>“But I think people are more conscious of their health now.</p>
      <p>“Where I live in Limerick everyone is out walking in the evenings so people are more conscious and not ignoring things.</p>
      <p>“Whether it be food, putting on extra weight or drinking too much or what’s the contents of a dish you are eating, I think we are just a bit more conscious.”</p>
      <p>The comic, who is back on the road with his stand-up show Hey! in the New Year added he feels the age old “drugs, sex and rock ‘n’ roll” lifestyle is dying out as people become more health savvy.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t think it is as much anymore. When I started it, it was a given that you were smoking and drinking and you were travelling home at four in the morning.</p>
      <p>“There would always be an after-show somewhere.</p>
      <p>“But the older you get, no. When I finish a show now I go straight to the hotel room and I have one pint and a sandwich and sleep.</p>

      <p>“After about an hour the whole adrenaline rush drops and you are just shattered.</p>
      <p>“And you have done the whole party thing before but I also think it has changed.</p>
      <p>“I think people are more health conscious now and I even noticed when I was on Broadway and the West End with all the actors and everything you see people eating bowls of the strangest looking vegetables I’ve ever seen and all sorts of things.”</p>
      <p>Looking back at the high points of his glittering career in showbiz, the Killinaskully star admitted it took him a while to realise how big some of the opportunities were at the time.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Garage in Cannes was enormous and it almost flew past before I realised how big it was and then being on Broadway with Daniel Radcliffe and the lads in New York again was nearly over before I realised how important and big a gig it was and then the West End stage as well with the same production.</p>
      <p>“I mean they were huge gigs and I was fortunate to get them.”</p>
      <p>Recalling some of the rougher moments along the way, he admitted it was often tough to get up on stage and put on the funnyman act when he wasn’t feeling his best.</p>
      <p>He said: ”There have been loads of low points. And there are always low points.</p>
      <p>“Whether that is something happens in your own family, and that affects you when you have to get up on stage and be funny or whatever, and it is tough. But you kind of get through it, you don’t have a choice. So there has been a couple of low points in my career and in my life down through the years.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, remembering some of the Irish icons who passed away over the year, Shortt recalled the lasting effect the likes of Gay Byrne and Niall Toibin have had on his life.</p>

      <p>He said: “Gay Byrne was a legendary individual and they don’t come any bigger and iconic than him.</p>
      <p>“He was a great father figure to everyone in the industry and he also used to give advice to everyone and he was an entertainer himself. And then I got to know Niall Toibin over the years and I actually idolised him, he was my favourite comic.</p>
      <p>“And also kind of a bit like myself he was an actor as well. He would have always said he wasn’t a comedian. He was an actor doing comedy.</p>
      <p>“And that is kind of funny because he was a proper actor. Sometimes comedians don’t get acknowledged as being actors because you are doing comedy so I kind of understood where he was coming with that.”</p>
      <p>Shortt also recalled fond memories with fellow comic, Brendan Grace, who passed away in July. He said: “He was just a fantastic individual, I grew up watching in Bottler</p>
      <p>“And when I was very young, I was only 18, I ended up, with Jon Kenny, attending one of the rehearsals of the Sunday night at the Gaiety and that was kind of cool being in the dressing room with Brendan Grace.”</p>
      <p>Commenting on the current situation in RTE, Shortt, who worked on various shows with the broadcaster said he hopes the changes don’t see too many people getting hurt along the way. However, he admitted the change in the industry has made him realise you have to be able to throw your hand at any <br/>platform.</p>
      <p>Shortt, who is filming three new movies the new year in addition to recording his podcast, said: “You have to reinvent yourself. The one thing about being someone like myself is you are still creative, and I will still create work. What platform I will put it out on, I’m not sure.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shortt’s stage show Hey! comes to Dublin’s Olympia Theatre from January 30 to February 1. Tickets will go on sale this Friday from 9am at Ticketmaster outlets nationwide.</li>
