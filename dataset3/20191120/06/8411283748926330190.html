      <h1>Concraft sees bright prospects for 1Q20 amid strong demand for TWS devices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:01:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ninelu Tu, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Acoustic component maker Concraft is set to land more windfall orders in the first quarter of 2020 as current market demand for true wireless stereo (TWS) devices launched by its clients has outpaced supply, according to company CFO Joe Huang.</p>
      <p>The entire TWS supply chain has been benefiting from the spillover effect of strong sales of Apple's AirPods Pro since its launch at the end of October, Huang said.</p>
      <p>Concraft has clear order visibility for TWS components extending to the first half of 2020, and it expects robust results in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, Huang said at the company's latest investors meeting.</p>
      <p>Despite strong sales of TWS devices at the moment, Concraft has no plans to further expand its production lines for acoustic components on concerns of maintaining a balance between supply and demand, Huang noted.</p>
      <p>However, the company will kick off trial volume production of related automotive components - which have been verified - in December, paving the way for commercial shipments in January 2020, Huang revealed.</p>
      <p>It will also roll out new injection optical components at the end of the first quarter of 2020 at the earliest.</p>
      <p>The company also disclosed that it posted net profit of NT$217 million (US$7.115 million) on revenues of NT$3.331 billion in the first three quarters of 2019. Gross margin for the nine-month period stood at 32.2%.</p>
