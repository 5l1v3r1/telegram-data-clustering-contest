      <p>With local unemployment sitting at a startling 29%, targeted skills development is critical for social and economic stability. Having identified key skills gaps, Sebata Municipal Solutions has established its Skills Development Centre (SDC), which specialises in the training of unemployed youth, municipal employees and corporate clients.</p>
      <p>Sebata SDC has just achieved a remarkable 100% pass rate for its Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) skills programme, underscoring the success and powerful influence of Sebata’s training.   </p>
      <p>“We can attribute this phenomenal pass rate to the quality of our facilitators, the exceptional administrative team and good training facilities,” says Graham Reid, Sebata Skills Development and Training Manager.</p>
      <p>“Importantly, the Sebata SDC learnerships and skills programmes are highly attractive because they open the door to international job opportunities for graduates.”</p>
      <p>According to Reid, the MCSA is a certification programme intended for people seeking entry-level jobs in an IT environment. MCSA, rooted in core technical skills, is a prerequisite for some of the advanced Microsoft certifications.</p>
      <p>The recent MCSA training conducted by Sebata SDC was funded by The Media, Information and Communication Technologies Sector Education and Training Authority (MICT-SETA), and Sebata SDC is also able to access funding on behalf of clients. </p>
      <p>With regard to the MCSA programme at the SDC training centre in Greater Letaba, Limpopo, 43 learners successfully completed the programme on 19 September. </p>
      <p>At the SDC training centre in Pinetown, Durban, 24 learners successfully completed the programme on 14 September. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Career progression</b>
      </p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Sebata will be registering the graduates on its Microsoft Gold Partnership. This highly sought-after membership includes the following: online technical and sales training; access to the Microsoft Partner Learner Centre (creating the opportunity to upgrade one’s studies); and exclusive access to Microsoft toolkits, tools and utilities. Importantly, partners in this programme are exposed to domestic and international companies for job opportunities, and they also receive the latest news updates about Microsoft events, products and services.</p>
      <p> “We’re also able to offer market-related pricing, which is appealing for municipalities, corporates and individuals,” adds Reid. “Sebata SDC is committed to sustainable skills development, and the recent pass rates fully demonstrate our dedication to empowering people through education and the creation of exciting career opportunities.” </p>
