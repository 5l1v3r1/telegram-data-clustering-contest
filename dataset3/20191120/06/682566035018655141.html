      <p>Madrid - <b>Nick Kyrgios </b>has said he can beat anyone at the <b>Davis Cup</b> and is ready to lead <b>Australia</b> to victory in the tournament after they beat <b>Colombia</b> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Kyrgios overcame Alejandro Gonzalez 6-4, 6-4 and Alex de Minaur defeated Daniel Galan 6-4, 6-3 to create an unassailable lead ahead of the last doubles rubber.</p>
      <p>Australia could seal their place in the quarter-finals by beating Belgium on Wednesday and Kyrgios, who has returned from a two-month break to play in Madrid, was feeling bullish after his win.</p>
      <p>"I haven't played that much in the past couple of months but I took time off to get ready for this event," Kyrgios said afterwards.</p>
      <p>"I think we can win it for sure. The way that Alex is playing and I know I can beat every single person in this competition.</p>
      <p>"We have a great doubles player in John Peers and Jordan (Thompson) can play singles or doubles.</p>
      <p>"Then we have great energy guys like John Millman so we have good depth. I think our chemistry compared to the other teams is up there."</p>
      <p>Canada's Vasek Pospisil and Denis Shapovalov won singles ties against Reilly Opelka and Taylor Fritz respectively to secure victory over the United States while France had earlier survived a scare, the tournament's top seeds needing to win a decisive doubles rubber to beat Japan.</p>
      <p>Even without their injured star Kei Nishikori, Japan came close to recording a major upset on the second day at the Caja Magica before experienced French duo Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert pulled the 10-time champions over the line.</p>
      <p>Their 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-5 victory against Ben McLachlan and Yasutaka Uchiyama clinched victory for France after Gael Monfils slipped to a surprise 7-5, 6-2 singles loss to world number 73 Yoshihito Nishioka.</p>
      <p>Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had opened with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Uchiyama.</p>
      <p>France, on their 100th appearance in the Davis Cup, are one of the favourites this week even if they have been highly sceptical of the controversial changes to the 119-year-old competition.</p>
      <p>The new format this year means the tournament takes place in one venue, across a single week, with organisers, among them Barcelona footballer Gerard Pique, hoping a tighter schedule will revitalise the prestigious trophy.</p>
      <p>But the three stadiums were all far from full for Tuesday's early matches.</p>
      <p>"I have to say, it is a strange feeling," said Mahut. "When you play Davis Cup, usually the stadium is full."</p>
      <p>"Actually, it was pretty special because it was the first time I hear myself singing the Marseillaise," added Herbert.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Argentina beat Chile 3-0 and Kazakhstan prevailed 2-1 against the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Kazakhstan, who will face Andy Murray and Great Britain in Group E on Wednesday, needed Mikhail Kukushkin and Alexander Bublik to win the doubles rubber 6-4, 7-6 (7/2) against Dutch pair Robin Haase and Jean-Julien Rojer.</p>
