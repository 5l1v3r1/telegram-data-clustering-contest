      <p>David Villa has labelled Harry Kane as the best striker in the world.</p>
      <p>Spain’s record scorer believes no one can touch the England captain as a number nine.</p>
      <p>Kane now has 32 goals in 45 games for the Three Lions after a hat-trick against Montenegro and a strike in Kosovo as England reached Euro 2020 last week.</p>
      <p>World Cup winner Villa scored 59 times in 98 games for Spain and insisted Kane is perfect.</p>

      <p>“He is great in almost everything he does, he is one of the candidates for taking the golden boot at Euro 2020 for sure.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham sit 14th in the Premier League, nine points off the top four, after failing to build on last season’s run to the Champions League final, where they lost to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Captain Kane still has 10 goals for Spurs this term and has been linked with Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid in the past.</p>
      <p>But Villa insisted he does not have to leave White Hart Lane to fulfil his ambitions.</p>

      <p>“I know they are not doing so well this year but I’m not in his mind, I don’t know his future. He will be a good player wherever he goes for sure, he has talent to play in other leagues.”</p>
      <p>Villa announced this week he will retire in January after a season with Vissel Kobe in Japan.</p>
      <p>It came after four years with New York City FC and the former Barcelona star will now spearhead a team in the New York borough of Queens.</p>

      <p>“I’m not worried about about he next step, I’ve got many priorities ahead and one of them is Queensboro,” he added, speaking at the launch of the Booking.com Stadium Suite.</p>
      <p>“We have many things to do, it’s one of the things in the next step of my life.”</p>
