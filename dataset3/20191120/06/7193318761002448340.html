      <p>Gov. Kevin Stitt endorsed federal proposals on Tuesday that he said would prevent states from using the Clean Water Act to block energy projects because of a bias against fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>Testifying to the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in Washington, D.C., Stitt said states shouldn’t be able to “politicize” the Clean Water Act and “harm the assets of other states.”</p>
      <p>Democrats countered that states and Indian tribes have the right to make decisions protecting their water from pollution.</p>
      <p>Controversy over a section of the Clean Water Act has arisen in recent years because some contend coastal states are blocking fossil fuel projects over concerns about climate change.</p>
      <p>Sen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, complained Tuesday that the state of Washington, citing the Clean Water Act, refused to approve a coal export terminal because it was “bad for the environment.”</p>
      <p>Barrasso’s home state coal industry had hoped to use the terminal. The controversy is being litigated.</p>
      <p>Barrasso has introduced legislation that he says would prevent states from “weaponizing” the Clean Water Act and force them to focus only on the potential to pollute certain bodies of water.</p>
      <p>Laura Watson, senior Assistant Attorney General for the state of Washington, testified Tuesday that the state’s decision against the coal terminal project was based on concerns about harm to the state’s water and wasn't political.</p>
      <p>“For example, over 30 acres of wetlands would have been destroyed by this project,” she said. “The project would have required dredging of 41 acres of Columbia River bed and would have produced contaminated storm water from stockpiling 1.5 million tons of material onsite.”</p>
      <p>The Environmental Protection Agency, now led by a former Republican staff member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, proposed a rule this year addressing the situation. The proposed rule would narrow the scope and time frame of the Clean Water Act section used by Washington and other states to deny energy project permits.</p>
      <p>Stitt, a Republican, said Oklahoma typically conducts Clean Water Act review for pipeline projects in 60 days.</p>
      <p>“We have some of the cleanest water, yet we are the pipeline capital of the world,” Stitt said.</p>
      <p>Stitt said a Russian tanker “absurdly” delivered liquefied natural gas to northeastern states last winter because those states won’t approve pipelines.</p>
      <p>Stitt said he supported Barrasso’s bill and the EPA proposal.</p>
      <p>“A clear scope and a reasonable timeline are not invasive to states’ rights,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The current proposed rule, and the opportunity to strengthen it legislatively, does nothing to prevent Oklahoma’s regulators from properly and scientifically considering whether a project negatively affects water quality in our state.”</p>
      <p>Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., said Republican proposals regarding the Clean Water Act section under dispute would limit the input of states.</p>
      <p>“Silencing the input of Americans most directly impacted is the wrong approach, especially since these voices often represent the state and tribal governments that are on the front lines working to safeguard their water supply,” she said.</p>
      <p>Barrasso’s bill, if it passed the Senate, would meet stiff resistance in the House of Representatives, which is controlled by Democrats. The proposed EPA rule would likely wind up in a court challenge if it were approved.</p>
