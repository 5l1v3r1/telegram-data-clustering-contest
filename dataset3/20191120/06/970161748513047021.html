      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! contestant Caitlyn Jenner started to open up about her famous family to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts.</p>
      <p>Yes, it’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for.</p>
      <p>In last night’s episode, the former Olympian spoke candidly about <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> not going to university and how she set up her first company, as well as her relationship with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>.</p>
      <p>Talking about how Kim got the business bug, Caitlyn recalled: ‘Kimberly never went to college. The minute she left high school she started businesses. She had her first business out of the closet.’</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘Kimberly would go into the ladies’ closets. Some of these are like 2,000 square feet – they’re huge. Beverly Hills ladies.</p>
      <p>‘They figure out what they want to get rid of and Kimberly has an eBay site… Kimberly sells them for them and gets 30% commission.’</p>

      <p>Adele then asked whether Kim would have helped her husband Kanye when he began getting into the fashion industry.</p>
      <p>‘Oh yeah,’ Caitlyn replied.</p>

      <p>She went on to reveal her thoughts about the Jesus Walks rapper and added: ‘I like Kanye. Kanye was very, very good to me.’</p>
      <p>Caitlyn’s conversation comes just hours after it was reported that her ex-wife Kris Jenner was<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/kris-jenner-scared-caitlyn-jenner-will-expose-jenner-kardashian-family-secrets-im-celebrity-11178922/"> ‘scared’ that she’d expose details from the Kardashian and Jenner families’ private lives</a>.</p>

      <p>While we’re<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/"> desperate to know all the family’s tea</a>, such as if the campmate has beef with Khloe Kardashian and whether or not Drake is dating Kylie, the momager is secretly panicking that her former partner’s time in the jungle could spell disaster.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the week, Caitlyn admitted that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caitlyn-jenner-says-kardashians-know-im-celeb-stayed-silent-social-media-11178480/">the Kardashians know that she’s on I’m A Celebrity</a> despite not showing their support on social media.</p>

      <p>‘Yeah, they all know,’ Cait told her campmates.</p>
