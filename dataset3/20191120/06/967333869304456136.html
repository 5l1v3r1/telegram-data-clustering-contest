        <b>WASHINGTON (Sputnik) – Russian diplomats have visited Russian national Alexei Burkov, who was recently extradited from Israel to the United States on charges of involvement in cybercrimes, at a detention facility in Virginia, the Russian Embassy in the US said in a statement.</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>"Embassy employees have visited Russian national Burkov, extradited from Israel to the US, at a pre-trial detention centre in Alexandria, in the state of Virginia. We are<a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911101077272337-israeli-court-rejects-request-to-block-burkovs-extradition-to-us---lawyer/"> in constant contact with Alexei</a>, his relatives and lawyer," the embassy said in a Facebook press release on Wednesday.</blockquote>
      <p>The statement added that Burkov is being provided with all the necessary consular legal assistance.</p>
      <blockquote>"We will seek compliance with his legal rights and interests," the embassy stressed.</blockquote>
      <p>The US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia extended the detention of Burkov last week, without specifying how long he would be kept in custody.</p>
      <p>Burkov is charged with running two websites for hackers, including one that was selling stolen bank card numbers that were used in more than $20 million worth of fraudulent purchases.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911031077213683-burkov-calls-israeli-decision-on-extradition-to-us-aggressive-hopes-to-return-to-russia/">charges include wire fraud</a>, computer intrusions, identity theft, and money laundering. If convicted, Burkov faces a maximum sentence of 80 years in prison. However, actual sentences for federal crimes are typically less than the maximum prescribed penalties, according to the US Justice Department.</p>
      <p>Prior to his extradition to the United States, Burkov spent almost four years in Israeli custody fighting unsuccessfully to be sent home while <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910281077167259-russian-embassy-in-bulgaria-declines-to-comment-on-expulsion-of-its-diplomat/">local authorities enforced a ban</a> on his case in the media.</p>
