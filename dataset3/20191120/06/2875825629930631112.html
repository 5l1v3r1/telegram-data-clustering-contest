      <h1>Gary Murphy column: Chasing pack out to get Wiesberger in Dubai - but McIlroy has his own aims</h1>
      <h2>The world No1 claims Rory isn’t a rival – but if 2020 continues on like this year, it is only a matter of time before Mcllroy is back at the summit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/gary-murphy/" target="_blank">Gary Murphy</a></address>
      <p>I can’t wait for the final shoot-out for the Race To Dubai title – and lucky for me I’ll be on the course, calling the action.</p>
      <p>Last year was my first DP World finale, when Frankie Molinari was crowned champion. I interviewed him afterwards, and the sense of elation was palpable so it’s great to be back there with DP World as part of their corporate commentary team.</p>
      <p>It really is an historic achievement to emerge as Europe’s top dog.</p>
      <p>But the exciting situation this week is that there are two tournaments at play.</p>
      <p>The winner after four rounds will bank the biggest cheque in the history of European Tour golf – a cool $3 million.</p>
      <p>Yet there are many other sub-plots bubbling under, with Ryder Cup points, world rankings and exemptions for all the majors and WGCs next season up for grabs.</p>
      <p>The main show here would normally be Rory McIlroy. He can’t win the Race To Dubai but will be super keen to round off his most consistent season with a fifth victory.</p>
      <p>His regular caddie, Harry Diamond, will not be by his side this week as he is at home after the birth of his first child.</p>
      <p>Niall O’Connor, the former Ulster rugby player, is a pal of Rory’s and will carry the bag this week. It will be a treat for him to be inside the ropes with the world No2, who is trying to win this title for the third time.</p>
      <p>Rory, too, has something extra to play for in terms of the world rankings - it’s a huge opportunity to narrow the gap to Brooks Koepka.</p>
      <p>The world No1 claims Rory isn’t a rival – but if 2020 continues on like this year, it is only a matter of time before Mcllroy is back at the summit.</p>

      <p>This week, the man to catch is Bernd Wiesberger. He stands alone at the top of the rankings.</p>
      <p>He really could have cemented his spot with a slightly better finish at the Nedbank in Sun City, although his tied third place was another brilliant performance.</p>
      <p>He left with a bitter taste, dropping three shots in the last four holes. But it has been a <br/>remarkable season from 28 starts – by far the most consistent of all the contenders from a true European Tour player.</p>
      <p>Wiesberger’s return from serious injury which could have cost him his career has been so impressive.</p>
      <p>His wins at the Made in Denmark, Scottish Open and Italian Open confirmed his return to the top of European golf.</p>
      <p>Now he’s bidding to become the first Austrian to win the Race To Dubai and is seeking to nail down a spot on Padraig Harrington’s Ryder Cup team.</p>
      <p>But the seven-time European Tour winner will need all his guile and skill to get over the line as the chasing pack is littered with the armoury to topple him.</p>
      <p>It’s set up for a wonderful showdown in the desert.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lowry is still in with a shout</b>

      <p>Shane Lowry is in the mix at number four and still can win the lot with a huge week in Dubai.</p>
      <p>He has been steady in the play-offs rather than spectacular.</p>
      <p>He just flatlined in Turkey, mainly due to tiredness, and hopefully the week’s rest will stand him in good stead.</p>
      <p>Lowry has hit the heights throughout this season. His win in Abu Dhabi really set up his year and totally changed his schedule.</p>
      <p>That fed into his amazing display at Royal Portrush to be crowned the Open Champion but he has also shown really good form outside those two weeks.</p>
      <p>He’s at a world ranking of 19 – his best ever is 17, so this week presents a great opportunity to reach another milestone.</p>
      <p>He has mentioned his burning desire to be part of Team Europe in Whistling Straits next year.</p>
      <p>If he were to win and claim all the loot his position on the team would be almost guaranteed.</p>
      <p>The beauty of this week is that all the players will feel the pressure from the start as this is the last chance saloon for everybody, whatever their goals.</p>
      <p>Lowry knows what is at stake and hopefully the rest from action will recharge the batteries for one last push to become Europe’s No.1 golfer.</p>

        <b>Stellar supporting cast out to make the headlines</b>

      <p>The supporting cast in Dubai is a stellar one.</p>
      <p>Tommy Fleetwood – who re-entered the equation with a stunning victory in South Africa on Sunday – will be keen to regain the crown he won in 2017.</p>
      <p>Jon Rahm is well rested but has played a dangerous game of leaving it all to the final tournament.</p>
      <p>His win in Madrid confirmed his class and he’ll be keen to become the first Spaniard since the great Seve Ballesteros in 1991 to become Europe’s number one. He is also very confident on this layout, having won here in 2017, so it’s folly to see him out of the shake-up.</p>
      <p>Matt Fitzpatrick is another contender who can claim the crown were he to win on Sunday and as another former champion around here, it really speaks volumes for the quality on show.</p>
      <p>He has shown great quality throughout the year and the only ingredient missing is a win.</p>
      <p>No better time than now.</p>
