      <p>Teacher Service Commission’s (TSC) plan to cut ties with Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) was on Tuesday halted by a Nairobi court.</p>
      <p>Labour court Judge Maureen Onyango suspended the termination notice until the case is heard and determined.</p>
      <p>Justice Onyango also ordered that the respondents; Nancy Macharia and TSC file responses to preliminary objections within seven days from the date of service.</p>

      <p>“That in the meantime, the notice of termination ins suspended pending hearing and determination of the preliminary objection,” she ordered.</p>
      <p>The case will be heard on 11 December.</p>
      <p>In a termination notice issued on November 4, the commission argued that the teachers’ union did not have the simple majority of unionisable employees under the employment of the Commission.</p>

      <p>“Take notice that in view of Section 54 of the Labour Relations Act, the commission has made the requisite application to the National Labour Board,” the notice read in part.</p>
      <p>According to the Labour Act, for a union to be recognized by the commission, it must have 50 per cent plus one of all the teachers in the commission’s register.</p>
      <p>Thus far, the country has 318,000 teachers in both public and primary schools and therefore Knut needs to have at least 159,000 members.</p>

      <p>But according to the commission’s latest register, Knut, which mostly represents primary school teachers, has only 115,000 members, falling short of the 50 plus one threshold.</p>
      <p>On Monday, KNUT moved to court in a bid to win back more than 86,000 teachers who exited following escalated fights with TSC.</p>
      <p>The 11-member National Steering Committee, led by Secretary-General Wilson Sossion, who was deregistered as a teacher, seeks to win back it’s members.</p>
