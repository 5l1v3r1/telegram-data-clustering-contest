      <p>If you’re over the age of 60, it’s likely your mailbox is filling up with all sorts of Medicare information.</p>
      <p>If you or someone in your family is contemplating their Medicare options, buyer beware.</p>
      <p>The Medicare Open Enrollment Period runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7. During this time, individuals may sign up or make changes to their health plans and prescription drug coverage.</p>
      <p>If you are nearing age 65, you may have questions. Should you enroll in Part A, can you defer part B, what plan to choose for D, and what’s happening with plans F and G? The process for many is overwhelming.</p>
      <p>“We call it the Medicare Maze for a reason,” said Ray Walker, Director of the Medicare Assistance Program (MAP). “It can get complicated and confusing if you try to navigate things on your own. That is why we are here to help.”</p>
      <p>MAP is a division of the Oklahoma Insurance Department.</p>
      <p>It is funded by the State Health Insurance Counseling Program (SHIP) and Senior Medicare Patrol (SMP) grants through the Administration for Community Living.</p>
      <p>“Our program is free, unbiased and confidential,” Walker said. “We work to help consumers make the best decisions to meet their health care needs.”</p>
      <p>MAP has specially trained counselors who can help consumers select a plan for next year.</p>
      <p>According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, there will be over 16,000 Oklahoma seniors looking for a new Medicare Health Plan due to plans exiting the Oklahoma market.</p>
      <p>There are a few changes in the 2020 Medicare Supplement Plans.</p>
      <p>Beginning next year, those individuals who are just becoming eligible for Medicare will not be able to purchase Plans C and F, the two plans that cover the Medicare Part B deductible, which is $185.00 in 2019.</p>
      <p>Plan F has been the most popular plan for a long time, since it covered the balance of all the expenses for Medicare covered services, whether inpatient or outpatient.</p>
      <p>The next most comprehensive plan that will be available will be Plan G, which covers everything Plan F covered except the Part B deductible.</p>
      <p>For those beneficiaries who are currently enrolled in Plans C or F, they need not worry.</p>
      <p>As long as they continue to pay their monthly premiums, those plans will continue to pay in the future just as they always have.</p>
      <p>“I’m thrilled we have an option to call the Oklahoma Insurance Department and the Medicare Assistance Program for help, and we won’t be sold anything,” said John Vincent, part-time MAP coordinator.</p>
