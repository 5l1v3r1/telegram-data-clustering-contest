      <p>Former Democratic Party lawmaker Albert Ho Chun-yan was attacked by unidentified men in Tin Hau on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ho, who currently chairs the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, organizer of the June 4 candlelight vigils, told media that he was about to leave Tin Hau MTR Station at around 7 p.m., when he was told by residents that several black-clad men were right outside, but he did not mind their warning.</p>
      <p>As he was walking on an alley near the Central Library, he noticed that he was being tailed by several people, who then started assaulting him with long, hard objects that appeared to be canes, Ho said.</p>
      <p>After the assailants fled, Ho said he was able to hail a taxi and went to Ruttonjee Hospital, where he received medical treatment for six or seven welts on his back and injuries to both arms.</p>
      <p>Ho said his right arm had to be in a cast due to a slight bone fracture, adding that he has reported the incident to the police, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported.</p>
      <p>Back in 2006, Ho was attacked by club-wielding men at a McDonald’s outlet in Central.</p>
      <p>Tuesday night’s attack came only a few days before the District Council elections scheduled for Sunday, but Ho said he did not want to speculate any link between the incident and the coming polls.</p>
      <p>He said many politicians have become targets of violence over the past months, but he had not received any specific threat recently, nor would he try to guess the motives of the attackers, RTHK reported.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on Tuesday night, pan-democratic lawmakers strongly condemned the attack on Ho, and urged the police to bring the culprits to justice promptly.</p>
