      <p>Canada beat the United States in the Davis Cup for the first time on Tuesday, defeating the Americans 2-0 on the second day of the revamped team competition to end a run of 15 straight losses.</p>
      <p>Vasek Pospisil edged Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) and Denis Shapovalov defeated Taylor Fritz 7-6 (6), 6-3 to give the Canadians an insurmountable lead in Group F of the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>It was Canada's first win in 16 meetings with the United States in the 119-year-old competition, although the teams had not played since 1965. The Americans had lost only three matches in total against their neighbors in the previous 15 meetings.</p>

        <b>Brewers revamping ball-in-glove logo</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Milwaukee Brewers are bringing back the team's iconic ball-in-glove logo next year.</p>
      <p>Milwaukee unveiled its new uniform designs and logo on Monday night at Miller Park. Starting in 2020, players will wear a modernized version of the ball-in-glove image first introduced in 1978 and worn until 1993.</p>
      <p>A "M" and the "B" are linked above the glove's webbing. The ball features two vertical seams, making it look more authentic.</p>
      <p>A 50th anniversary sleeve patch will commemorate the team's half-century in Milwaukee after launching as the Seattle Pilots in 1969 and then moving.</p>
      <p><b>BRAVES:</b> Atlanta has signed Chris Martin to a two-year, $14 million deal, bringing the right-hander back after he closed out 2019 with the club.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old Martin was acquired by Atlanta from the Texas Rangers for left-hander Kolby Allard at the July 31 trade deadline.</p>
      <p>Atlanta also introduced reliever Will Smith at a news conference on Tuesday. Smith agreed to a $40 million, three-year contract with the Braves on Thursday following an All-Star season with San Francisco.</p>
