      <p>Jose Mourinho says he is excited to work with the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur squad after being appointed as the club's new manager.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss has replaced Mauricio Pochettino in North London and signed a deal until the end of the 2022/23 season.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," he told the club website.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.” </p>
      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy added: “Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
