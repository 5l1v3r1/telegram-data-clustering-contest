      <h1>EgisTec expects slight revenue drop in 4Q19</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:19:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:19</time> by <a rel="author">Cage Chao, Taipei; Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Taiwan-based Egis Technology (EgisTec) expects to post a slight sequential decrease in fourth-quarter revenues. Revenues will return to sequential growth in the first quarter of 2020, according to the fingerprint sensor specialist.</p>
      <p>EgisTec expects its shipments to be lower-than-expected in the fourth quarter, due to customers' intention to work off their existing inventory at quarter-end to settle accounts. Customers' transition from old to new products will also drag down EgisTec's shipments during the fourth quarter, said the fingerprint sensor supplier.</p>
      <p>EgisTec posted October revenues of NT$836 million (US$27.4 million), down 1.6% from the record high set in September. The company's cumulative 2019 revenues through October totaled NT$6.2 billion, rising 18.8% on year.</p>
      <p>EgisTec's net profit surged 22.5% sequentially to NT$289 million in the third quarter of 2019, while revenues climbed to a record high of NT$2.075 billion. EPS for the quarter came to NT$4.23.</p>
      <p>Samsung Electronics, and several China-based first- and second-tier smartphone vendors are reportedly among EgisTec's customers.</p>
