      <p>When Fox hired <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> to talk about wrestling and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a>, they knew they were signing up the Voice of the Voiceless. According to<a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/"> Wrestlingnews.co</a>, CM Punk criticized the Big Dog segment on WWE SmackDown that featured Baron Corbin.</p>
      <p>In the recent episode of WWE <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/smackdown">SmackDown</a>, Corbin brought up a man in a dog costume to mock Roman Reigns. The segment was perhaps not very well liked by some WWE fans and was not well received in the internet wrestling community.</p>

      <p>On WWE Backstage, Punk didn't hold back in what he considered to be bad creative. He said,</p>
      <blockquote>"The less said about it I think is better. You can’t possibly defend that. The creative is bad, I don’t anything about Baron Corbin. He’s one of the newer guys that I gotta check him out but that’s a bad start.”</blockquote>
      <p>Punk is staying true to his word and calling it like he sees it. His honesty is shining right through and it's a nice and fresh take on the product and an added boost to WWE Backstage. Will he continue to state his mind going forward? It'll be interesting to see the next time he shows up.</p>
