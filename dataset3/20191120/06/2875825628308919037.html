      <h1>Robbie Henshaw opens up on having to withdraw from Connacht return</h1>
      <h2>For the first time since his move to Leinster in 2016, the Ireland centre was pencilled in to make his Sportsground return against former club Connacht</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Audrey Henshaw wasn't too upset that her son Robbie had to postpone his comeback from World Cup duty by a week.</p>
      <p>For the first time since his move to Leinster in 2016, the Ireland centre was pencilled in to make his Sportsground return against former club Connacht.</p>
      <p>He took a bit of "harmless stick" for having to withdraw but there was no avoiding it.</p>
      <p>"It was frustrating alright," said the 27-year-old. "I was in bed all day, the day of the game - down with a fever, an illness.</p>
      <p>"I was looking forward to going back and playing there. My family weren't too excited about it - just my mum, my dad was alright.</p>
      <p>"They're not too caught up in it, but she didn't want anyone from Connacht giving out about me.</p>
      <p>"She decided if I did play, she wouldn't go!</p>
      <p>"It was strange to know what the reception would have been like. I was wondering myself whether it would be a cheer or a boo.</p>
      <p>"We were just messing during the week, it was good excitement and we were looking forward to it, the lads down there were looking forward to it, too.</p>
      <p>"Fair play to the lads, they put in a physically dominant performance."</p>
      <p>Henshaw did get his boots back on last weekend, coming off the bench in Leinster's bonus point win over Benetton at the RDS.</p>
      <p>Having recovered fully from illness, he could start his first game of the season in Lyon next Saturday, regardless of whether Joe Tomane (hamstring) or Rory O'Loughlin (shoulder) are fit and available.</p>

      <p>Like the rest of Leinster's World Cup contingent, he was hungry for involvement following his World Cup return - probably more so in Henshaw's case after suffering an ankle injury just after landing in Japan.</p>
      <p>It prevented his involvement until he was fit enough to start the final pool game against Samoa and the quarter-final against the All Blacks.</p>
      <p>What he needs now, after the last couple of years of injury disruption, is a good run of games - starting this weekend.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, absolutely," nodded Henshaw. "Hopefully it's a long run this time because it has been interrupted the last few years.</p>
      <p>"Struggles with injury is part of the game. Every player has to deal with it, but hopefully a little bit of luck is on my side for the next few months.</p>
      <p>"It's been a tough period but not being injured is a positive.</p>
      <p>"The only way to get on with it (after Japan) is just get back on the pitch. You just look forward to getting back and doing what you're doing.</p>
      <p>"Being back in your own bed is massive as well, so there's lots of positives - but things didn't go the way we wanted them to go.</p>
      <p>"You just have to move on to the next chapter, put it behind you. Again, hugely frustrating."</p>
      <p>With Lyon, Henshaw sees parallels between the Top 14 leaders and the Toulouse side that pipped Leinster in France in the pool stages last year.</p>
      <p>"They've a similar kind of style, and that French flair - they keep the ball alive with their off-loads. They obviously have that physically dominant pack.</p>
      <p>"We played there three years ago against Clermont, it's a cauldron-like stadium when the crowds are on top of you".</p>
