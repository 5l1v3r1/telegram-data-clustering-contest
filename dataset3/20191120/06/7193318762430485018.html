      <p>The Duncan Police Department released the names of the victims and gunman from Monday's shooting in a Walmart parking lot.</p>
      <p>Police identified Rebecca Vescio Varela, 31, of Duncan, and Aubrey P. Perkins, 39, from Minco, as the two victims shot while sitting inside a car in a Walmart parking lot on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The shooter, identified as Wbiliado R. Varela Jr., 43, was the husband of Vescio Varela, though police said the two were separated and that Perkins and Vescio Varela had a "dating relationship."</p>
      <p>Lt. John Byers was the lead investigator of the shooting and said the following timeline is what Duncan Police have been able to piece together so far through video surveillance and witness interviews.</p>
      <p>Duncan police said around 9:30 a.m. on Monday, Vescio Varela and Perkins parked at the Walmart on U.S. Highway 81 in Duncan and went inside the store to visit the money center.</p>
      <p>Varela Jr. arrived and parked his truck facing the car that Vescio Varela and Perkins arrived in.</p>
      <p>When Vescio and Perkins came out of Walmart, they got in the car as Varela Jr. exited his vehicle and opened fire from the front of the car, firing nine rounds through the windshield before opening the driver door and shooting three more times, killing both Vescio Varela and Perkins.</p>
      <p>Varela Jr. then walked to the rear of the car, raised his semi-automatic handgun to his head and pulled the trigger, killing himself.</p>
      <p>Duncan police declined to say what they believed the killer's motive to be, but are classifying the shooting as a domestic incident.</p>
      <p>Law enforcement said there were some children involved in some of the relationships, but didn't specify which person the children belonged to. Duncan police said the Department of Human Services Child Welfare was contacted to assist.</p>
      <p>Byers said an armed citizen was attempting to approach Varela Jr. before he shot himself, but that the citizen did not speak with or make contact with the killer before he took his own life.</p>
      <p>That man's identity has not been released.</p>
      <p>Police said Varela Jr. was known for helping organize a charity motorcycle ride in nearby Marlow for the past 14 years. The money raised from the event every year went to a family in need of help with medical bills.</p>
      <p>"I know that Mr. Varela was involved in many charitable organizations in the Marlow area," Byers said. "It's a tragedy for anyone."</p>
      <p>A search of the Oklahoma State Courts Network shows Varela Jr. had a run-in with law enforcement in 1996, when he charged with possession of a stolen vehicle and attempting to elude a police officer.</p>
