      <h1>Just one in six Irish people now smoke but shocking report reveals 60% of us are obese</h1>
      <h2>A quarter of smokers quizzed in the poll said the plain packaging and health warnings introduced in 2018 was a good motivation to quit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Trevor Quinn</a></address>
      <p>Just one in six of us are now smokers with 165,000 fewer people puffing on the cancer sticks than there were five years ago, it has emerged.</p>
      <p>But our bulging waistlines are still a major health worry with 60% of us in Ireland overweight or obese – the same obesity level as last year.</p>
      <p>And the prevalence of smoking has dropped from 23% of the Irish population in 2015 to 17% this year according to the latest Healthy Ireland Survey.</p>
      <p>A quarter of smokers quizzed in the poll said the plain packaging and health warnings introduced in 2018 was a good motivation to quit</p>
      <p>And 40% of smokers insisted they have made an attempt to kick the habit during the the last 12 months, with health concerns being the prime motivator.</p>
      <p>Minister for Health Simon Harris said: ”I welcome the findings of this year’s Healthy Ireland Survey, and in particular the continued drop in the smoking rate.</p>
      <p>"This shows that our multi-pronged approach, with legislation, support for smoking cessation, and policies to denormalise smoking in our society, is bearing fruit and we are heading in the right direction to being a Tobacco Free Ireland.”</p>

      <p>Other key survey findings revealed adults here get 7.1 hours sleep on an average weeknight, while 42% of carers reported they themselves have a long-standing illness or health problem.</p>
      <p>Health Promotion Minister Catherine Byrne launched the annual Healthy Ireland Survey yesterday (Tue), which is funded by the Department of Health.</p>
      <p>She said: “The levels of overweight and obesity in our population remains a great cause for concern.</p>
      <p>“While levels appear to be stabilising, there is no room for complacency.</p>
      <p>“In recent years Government has introduced evidence-based policies and a range of initiatives and actions to tackle both obesity and physical inactivity, and implementation of these remains a priority.</p>
      <p>“This year’s survey shows a small increase in the number of people meeting the guidelines on physical activity, which is encouraging.”</p>
      <p>“The findings from the 2019 Survey report will help us monitor how well our policies are working, as well as identifying ways we can better support people to be healthy.”</p>

      <p>This year’s survey includes new areas of study including sleep and sun protection.</p>
      <p>The new data on sun protection shows that 92% of participants report using some form of protection when exposed to the sun for more than 30 minutes, with sunscreen and sunglasses being the most commonly used forms of protection.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Survey also contained a special report on parents and their health.</p>
      <p>The findings found that parents generally rate their health as very good and are less likely (than non-parents) to report a long-standing illness or health problem</p>
      <p>Mreanwhile, 63% of parents are overweight or obese, while 49% are achieving the recommended level of physical activity</p>
      <p>Mums and dads who were quizzed reported getting an average of 6.9 hours sleep on a usual weeknight</p>
      <p>Minister Byrne commented: “The survey shows us some encouraging findings about parents and their efforts to look after their families’ health, but also shows areas where we could better support parents and families to make healthier choices.”</p>
