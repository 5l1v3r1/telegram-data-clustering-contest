      <p>Niall Daly accepts that a number of stars will have to align if Padraig Pearse’s are to shock Dublin-like Corofin on Sunday.<br/><br/>The perennial Galway champions are bidding for a fourth successive AIB Connacht club title, which would bring them one step closer to becoming the first club to win three All-Irelands in-a-row.<br/><br/>Having just emerged from Roscommon for the first time ever, Daly accepts that Pearse’s are in “bonus territory” but insisted: “If we can produce a performance like we produced against Roscommon Gaels [in the county final] for the first 40 minutes and they’re a small bit off the levels they can hit, we’re going to be in with a good chance.”<br/><br/>He continued: “Everyone looks at Corofin and says, ‘Jesus, what football they play’. They should be compared, I don’t know if they are, to the Dublin team at the moment, like.<br/><br/>“Yeah, of course you watch them and you admire them but on Sunday we won’t be trying to do that anyway. Hopefully they’ll be admiring us.”<br/><br/>The Roscommon star said that they were “nearly seen to be the Mayo” of the local club scene after losing a number of county finals over the years, though having finally scaled the summit, it outstripped the Connacht title he won with the county team this year.<br/><br/>“It’s been brilliant to get over the line. The Connacht championship, we took it game by game. The first game against Tourlestrane was a tricky game; going down there, we weren’t sure what way it was going to go. We were only hopeful that it would go well.<br/><br/>“Thankfully it did. Then we had the game in London … that was as much a club event as anything. We had a huge crowd over from the club – people who were never seen in the club ground at times!<br/><br/>That Daly, 28, is joined on the team by his brothers Conor, 26, Ronan, 24, and Lorcan, 21, makes it even more unique for their family.<br/><br/>“Our back garden would have been fairly intense at times when we were younger, the four of us playing against each other. It definitely does make it special.<br/><br/>“On the day you’re just fighting your own corner. Mam and Dad in the stand would have been very nervous; they were probably more nervous than us. But it’s special for them.<br/><br/>“Once you throw on the jersey, you don’t really be worrying about that. You've 14 other lads beside you, and another lot on the bench.”  </p>
