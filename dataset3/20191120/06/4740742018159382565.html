      <h1>UK weather forecast: Further health warning as temperatures plummet below freezing</h1>
      <h2>Temperatures dropped to -9.9C in one part of Scotland</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Public Health England is urging the public to look out for vulnerable and elderly people as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weather">temperatures</a> plummet below freezing.</p>
      <p>The Met Office has said low temperatures will continue into today (November 20) after -9.9C was recorded in Braemar, north-east Scotland, earlier this week.</p>
      <p>With more cold weather on the way, health chiefs have warned that vulnerable people are at risk, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-forecast-cold-warning-20916015">Mirror Online reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Dr Emer OConnell, consultant in public health at Public Health England, said: "Older people and those with heart and lung problems are at risk of getting sick in cold weather.</p>
      <p>"Keep an eye out for those who may need help staying warm, ensure they wear lots of thin layers and have everything they need.</p>
      <p>"Below 18 degrees, changes to the body mean that the risk of strokes, heart attacks and chest infections increase so heating homes to this temperature is particularly important to stay well."</p>
      <p>For Bristol, temperatures thankfully won't be as bitterly cold.</p>
      <p>The outlook for today says: "The rain will clear throughout the morning, leaving patchy cloud and some sunny spells and a light breeze during the day.</p>
      <p>"Scattered showers will continue across Cornwall throughout. Maximum temperature 10C."</p>
      <p>But temperatures feel feel cooler across the city due to a nasty wind chill.</p>
      <h3>Met Office 5-day forecast</h3>
      <h4>Wednesday:</h4>
      <p>Western areas often cloudy with occasional rain. Mostly dry and bright elsewhere. Feeling cold in brisk southeasterly winds, with coastal gales in the west.</p>
      <h4>Outlook for Thursday to Saturday:</h4>
      <p>Northern and eastern areas should be dry on Thursday. Bands of rain, already in the southwest, will move slowly and erratically northeast to much of the UK through the period.</p>
