      <p>Aston Martin has unveiled its first sports utility vehicle (SUV) in its 106-year history.</p>
      <p>The British luxury car maker hopes the £158,000 (€184,000) DBX will boost its flagging sales.</p>
      <p>Other specialist automotive firms such as Porsche and Lamborghini have previously enjoyed success by launching SUVs.</p>
      <p>The DBX will be built at Aston Martin’s newly built factory in St Athan, South Wales.</p>

      <p>The firm described its first full-size five-seat vehicle as being “extremely adaptable to a wide variety of lifestyle needs and owners”.</p>
      <p>It offers “equal space and comfort” for passengers in the front and rear, with “class-leading” headroom and legroom.</p>
      <p>The vehicle has a top speed of 191mph and can accelerate from 0 to 62mph in 4.5 seconds.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin Lagonda president and group chief executive Dr Andy Palmer said: “I can’t emphasise enough how incredibly exciting and significant DBX is for Aston Martin.</p>
      <p>“Through its development alone, this beautiful SUV has already taken the company into new territories and in inspiring directions.”</p>
      <p>He went on: “This is a real landmark for this great British brand and I promise that DBX will reward all who experience it in their everyday lives.”</p>
      <p>The DBX is on sale from Wednesday, with the first deliveries scheduled for spring 2020.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Aston Martin reported a £92.3m pre-tax loss for the past three quarters as sales volumes slid on “tough trading conditions” in the UK and Europe.</p>
      <p>The company blamed falling sales in the UK and Europe as well as weak demand for its entry-level Vantage sports car.</p>
