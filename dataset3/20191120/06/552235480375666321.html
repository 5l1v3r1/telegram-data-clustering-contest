      <p>A popular Aldi worker who’s known by everyone is this week’s Say It With Flowers winner.</p>
      <p>Maggie Dunne was nominated by her daughter Michelle for all the hard work she does for her family.</p>
      <p>Michelle said: “My mum home-schooled me since I was 14 and helped me get into university to study mental health nursing.</p>
      <p>“She helped support me through having my baby, Tommy, who I was 38 weeks pregnant with when I graduated.”</p>
      <p>Maggie also helped Michelle get through uni by helping with essays and living costs.</p>
      <p>“She read all my essays through to make sure they were okay and supported me financially. She paid for my car insurance and gave me rent-free accommodation while I was studying.”</p>
      <p>Maggie currently works long weekends in Aldi but that doesn’t get her down and she has become a well-known face in the store.</p>
      <p>“All her customers love her,” said Michelle.</p>
      <p>“When I was getting scans when I was pregnant, everyone would say hello to her when walking through the hospital.”</p>
      <p>We helped Michelle surprise her mum at their Newmains home with a beautiful bouquet, courtesy of Pixies Petals.</p>
      <p>“She really is just a great mum, she never asks for anything and never complains about anything.</p>
      <p>“She is 58 and has sore arms but she is always smiling and making time for people. She does everything for everyone.”</p>
      <p>If you would like to nominate someone for our Say it with Flowers competition, you can do so by emailing their name, the reason for the nomination and a contact phone number for yourself to: news@wishawpress.co.uk.</p>
