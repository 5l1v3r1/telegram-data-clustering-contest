      <h1>Navy Killer: Is This China’s Dangerous New Anti-Ship Missile?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">David Axe</a></address>
      <p>A Chinese magazine might have revealed a new and potentially powerful anti-ship and land-attack missile, Roland Oliphant <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/publishing-error-may-revealed-chinas-132646232.html">reported</a> for <i>The Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>A centerfold graphic in a recent issue of <i>Modern Ships</i>, a government-produced magazine, depicts the Chinese air force’s new H-6N bomber carrying a previously unknown large missile under its belly, according to Oliphant.</p>
      <p>The computer-generated image could represent the public’s first glimpse of the CH-AS-X-13, an air-launched variant of the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile.</p>
      <p>The Chinese air force has modified a small number of H-6s apparently to carry the new missile, which could pose a serious danger to U.S. Navy vessels and other forces operating in the western Pacific. Aircraft carriers, in particular, could be at risk.</p>
      <p>The new H-6N variant of the venerable Chinese bomber first appeared over Beijing during preparations for celebrations marking the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Military parades and fly-overs took place on Oct. 1, 2019.</p>
      <p>The H-6Ns feature an under-fuselage recess that could accommodate a single, very large missile. The DF-21D is more than 30 feet long and weighs around 32,000 pounds. It can travel as far as 1,300 miles with a 1,200-pound warhead.</p>
      <p>“Experts say that there <a href="https://twitter.com/RupprechtDeino/status/1176172853596741635">at least four</a> of these aircraft presently assigned to a People's Liberation Army Air Force bomber brigade in China's Central Theater Command region,” Joseph Trevithick <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29975/new-photos-point-to-chinese-bomber-being-able-to-carry-huge-anti-ship-ballistic-missiles">wrote</a> at The War Zone.</p>
      <blockquote>Reports about the H-6N and its ballistic-missile launching mission <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/13511/is-this-chinas-df-21d-air-launched-anti-ship-ballistic-missile-toting-bomber">first began to emerge</a> in 2017. Xi'an Aircraft International Corporation's <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/20708/china-teases-its-h-20-stealth-bomber-and-trolls-northrop-grumman-at-the-same-time">H-6</a>, a derivative of the Soviet-era <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-16">Tu-16 Badger</a>, has been the centerpiece of China's bomber force since the 1970s.</blockquote>
