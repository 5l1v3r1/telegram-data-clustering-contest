        <b>The body of a man in a blue T-shirt was found floating face-down in the canal under the Sengkang West Avenue bridge yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) told The New Paper that upon receiving a call for assistance, SCDF rescue officers retrieved the body from the water.</p>
      <p>It added that the man was pronounced dead at the scene by SCDF paramedics.</p>
      <p>The canal that the body was found in is near Layar LRT station in Sengkang.</p>
      <p>A passer-by, Mr Amit Jain, 47, a consultant, told TNP he was walking back home from his usual morning jog when he spotted two policemen setting up police cordons.</p>
      <p>When he looked down into the canal, he saw a man in a blue shirt with black hair floating in the water.</p>
      <p>The police said that they were alerted to the case of unnatural death at about 6.39am, and investigations are ongoing.</p>
      <p>Mr Jain said: "I did not notice the body when I was first passing by the area, but on my way back, I saw two policemen.</p>
      <p>"(The body) was face down, I could not tell what age he was."</p>
      <p>Mr Jain said he stopped briefly but saw more policemen arrive, along with the paramedics.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was quite a ghastly sight and not what you expect to see on a routine run."Â </p>
