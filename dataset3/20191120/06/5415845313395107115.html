      <h1>Arsenal: 3 takeaways from Mauricio Pochettino madness</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal fans are abuzz since Tottenham announced the firing of Mauricio Pochettino, but take care not to misinterpret what’s happened here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>At long last, Pancho Villa, I mean Mauricio Pochettino has <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/mauricio-leaves-club/">been canned by Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Or, “is leaving the club” if you’re too sensitive to know the truth. And naturally, if it involves Tottenham, it also involves <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a>. Meaning that there are some opinions out there that have gone tragically awry.</p>
      <p>Pochettino spent five years at Spurs, where he did some notable things. He finished third in a two horse race in 2016 when Leicester City won the Premier League, for instance.</p>
      <p>Another big feather in the cap was his runner-up performance in the UEFA Champions League last year. They lost out in the final in typical Spursy fashion after putting in such an impressive showing coming back against Ajax.</p>

      </p>
      <p>And don’t forget finishing runners-up in the League Cup in 2015. This man is a damn good runner-up. But in five years, he never won a thing. So before things get too crazy out there, let’s assess some of the takeaways from his sacking.</p>
      <p>We start with No. 3.</p>
      <h3>3. Don’t use this against Unai Emery</h3>
      <p>Look, I get it. We’re all frustrated at Arsenal and we’re frustrated at Unai Emery, and we all think that the solution to everything is firing him now and moving on with someone who is actually equipped for the role.</p>
      <p>Apparently seeing Pochettino fired has Arsenal fans asking how he can be fired while Unai Emery still has a job.</p>
      <p>That’s literally the easiest question I’ve ever had to answer—because Pochettino had five years and no trophies and Unai Emery has about 16 months. Not to mention that in those 16 months, Emery already has one runner-up feather in his cap, so watch out Pancho Villa.</p>
      <p>I don’t understand the odd reverence that seems to be floating about for Pochettino either. If Emery was still here after five years of not winning anything, even if he was a Champions League runner-up, you’d all have your pitch forks and torches out ready to chase him out of town. In fact, you probably would have already.</p>
      <p>Anyway, more on this at No. 2.</p>
