      <p>The Foreign Secretary hit the general election campaign trail this week with Wolverhampton South West candidate Stuart Anderson.</p>
      <p>But the pair saw their efforts to win over resident Caroline Roberts on the doorstep of her home in the Warstones area of the city scuppered by an excitable black and white terrier called Bo.</p>

      <p>Mr Raab was heard joking that the dog "must be a Labour supporter" as he and former squaddie Mr Anderson struggled to get a word in above the cacophony.</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton South West, which was won by Labour's Eleanor Smith at the last election, has been highlighted as a key target for the Conservatives as Boris Johnson bids to secure the majority he requires to deliver Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Raab became the fifth high ranking Tory to visit the constituency in the space of a week, following in the footsteps of Mr Johnson, Chancellor Sajid Javid, and cabinet ministers Robert Jenrick and Johnny Mercer.</p>
      <p>He was joined by city councillors and activists for an afternoon of door knocking in the streets around Warstones Road.</p>

      <p>And the response was broadly positive, with some residents, including Andrew Barnes, saying they were backing the Tories to deliver on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Mr Raab told the Express &amp; Star: "I think Stuart has a cracking record in the military and in business outside politics and he knows the bread and butter issues that matter to people here.</p>
      <p>"He's got a clear and positive message. People want a bit of optimism. That's what Boris has brought and that's what Stuart has brought."</p>

        <figcaption>Resident Andrew Barnes told Mr Raab he was voting Tory because he wanted to see Brexit delivered.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>He added that the Conservative message of being the party to "get Brexit done" was resonating with people in the West Midlands, regardless of which way they voted in the EU referendum.</p>
      <p>"Both Leavers and Remainers want us to move on. They want to stop politicians from going round in circles and people can see that we have a deal in place to do that."</p>
      <p>He also shouted up other Tory policies including more cash for the NHS and extra police officers, and said he wanted Britain to be a "world leader" on workers' rights.</p>
      <p>"We've got a positive vision for all of that," he said.</p>
      <p>However, not everyone was impressed.</p>

      <p>"I'm fed up of the lot of them," said Lynda Pitt, as she dumped a Tory campaign leaflet into the wheelie bin outside her house.</p>
      <p>The other candidates are Ms Smith, who holds a 2,185 majority for Labour, the Brexit Party's Leo Grandison and Lib Dem Bart Ricketts.</p>
