      <h2>"Just like humans trapped next to the speakers in a mega-loud club, wildlife can’t chat up potential dates because of the noise"</h2>

      <p>The modern world is like living in a blaring disco for our birds and bees, experts say.</p>
      <p>And just like humans trapped next to the speakers in a mega-loud club, wildlife can’t chat up potential dates because of the noise.</p>
      <p>Noise pollution is now threatening the very survival of up to 100 species, researchers at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/queens-university">Queen’s University</a> in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/belfast">Belfast</a> have found.</p>
      <p>And our high decibel world is changing the behaviour of a wide range of species.</p>
      <p>“Noise must be considered as a global pollutant and we need to develop strategies to protect animals,” said lead researcher Dr Hansjoerg Kunc from the School of Biological Sciences.</p>

      <p>The study analysed the effects of noise in more than 100 species including amphibians, arthropods, (which includes insects) as well as birds, fish, mammals, molluscs and reptiles.</p>
      <p>All are finding life on 21st century Earth simply too loud.</p>
      <p>It’s a threat to their very survival - including their ability to reproduce.</p>
      <p>Many species including birds and mammals communicate with potential mates using acoustic signals.</p>
      <p>But their best chat up lines are being drowned out by environmental noise.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>
      <p>As well as the important task of choosing a mate, wildlife can’t warn family members of threats such as predators.</p>

      <p>While noise pollution prevents some creatures escaping predators, it’s the opposite story for nature’s hunters.</p>
      <p>Bats and owls rely on the sounds of potential prey to track them down.</p>
      <p>If they can’t hear, they can’t eat.</p>
      <p>In our oceans, fish larvae find their home based on the sound emitted by reefs but increased noise at sea mainly as a result of ships makes it more difficult for young fish to find a good home.</p>

      <p>The researchers found that noise pollution also has a huge impact on migration.</p>
      <p>Many birds will avoid noise polluted areas during migration, which in turn, affects where they will establish their long term homes to raise their young.</p>
      <p>“The study found clear evidence that noise pollution affects all of the seven groups of species,” Dr Kunc added.</p>
