      <p>Cairo (Reuters) - Two civilians were killed and some wounded in an Israeli attack on the Syrian capital of Damascus, state media said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said on Twitter that Israel had attacked Iranian and Syrian military targets in Syria as retaliation for rockets fired toward Israel the day before.</p>
      <p>Syria’s air defenses were able to destroy most of the missiles fired by Israeli jets over Damascus before they reached their targets, Syria’s state news agency SANA said, quoting a military source.</p>
