      <p>Speaking after his screening, he said the exercise was aimed at ascertaining all persons drawing money from the government’s coffers, adding that the exercise was not basically about verification of certificates, but for the government to curb wastage, plug leakages in its payroll and have valid data for planning.</p>
      <p>The governor assured the workers that while the screening lasts, no worker will be denied salary.</p>
      <p>Makinde had cried out upon assumption of office that the state wage bill increased by N1billion between the time he was declared the winner of the March 29 governorship election and May 29 when he was sworn in.</p>
      <p>The Head of Service, Mrs. Ololade Agboola, said no civil servant, public servant or pensioner would be treated unfairly by the exercise, adding that the target was to improve workers’ welfare.</p>
