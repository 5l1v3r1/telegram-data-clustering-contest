      <p>The Bristol skyline could get another new high-rise block if plans for a 15-storey apartment complex goes ahead.</p>
      <p>An outline <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/planning">planning</a> application has been submitted to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> to transform the site known as Leisure Island, just off the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/lawrence-hill">Lawrence Hill</a> roundabout, into more than 100 new flats and commercial space.</p>
      <p>Developers say they want to refurbish the the existing mixed-use Victorian brick terraces and warehouse located on the triangle bit of land, on <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/easton">Easton</a> Road and Lawrence Hill, on the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/old-market">Old Market</a> side of the roundabout.</p>

      <p>In its place will be 122 apartments and commercial and retail space. A six-storey perimeter block will sit on the edge of the development with a 15-storey tower in the middle which backs onto Lawrence Hill roundabout.</p>
      <p>It will include a mixture of one, two and three-bed apartments.</p>
      <p>If approved the plans would see the demolition of the car wash garage which looks over the roundabout - where the tower would be located.</p>
      <p>According to the Design and Access Statement the intention is to “provide a high quality contemporary new building” on a key site.</p>
      <p>The statement said: “It is intended that the most historically important building on the site, the retained Byzantine warehouse building, (the Gym) on Easton Road would become a focal point for the development as the main pedestrian entrance to the residential apartments.</p>

      <p>“It would also be adapted to provide a bike lift to the basement, for access to the proposed secure cycle stores.</p>
      <p>“Approximately half of the existing ground floor of this building would be utilised for the apartments, and the rest would be retained as a gym, for use by new residents as well as the wider public.”</p>
