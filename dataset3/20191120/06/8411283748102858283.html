      <h1>Panjit to better tap WBG power device market with new SiC diodes in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:25:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:25</time> by <a rel="author">Julian Ho, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Discrete power components supplier Panjit International is set to release its second-generation SiC diodes in February 2020 to tap the lucrative market for wide band-gap (WBG) power devices that is just taking off, according to the firm's chief strategy officer Jasper Lee.</p>
      <p>Lee said the new diode offering, in-house developed and processed with Cree SiC substrate, will carry a gross margin of 20-30% and will join IGBT and MOSFET as Panjit's three major product lines next year.</p>
      <p>Panjit will also launch power modules integrating IGBT and FRD (fast recovery diode) as such modules will emerge as mainstream industry trend, Lee said, adding that the company will unveil the first-generation 1,200 IGBT in 2020 for sales to Chinese clients. It may seek backend service support directly in China or sell IGBT diode wafers to power supply firms.</p>
      <p>In the power components sector, MOSFET and IGBT with silicon process remain the mainstream products, and top-specs ones for automotive application are now still dominated by major IDMs including Infinenon, ON Semiconductor and Mitsubishi. But Panjit has recruited high-end R&amp;D and marketing talent from first-tier makers in Europe, the US and South Korea, aiming to catch up with leading IDMs in the sector, according to Lee.</p>
      <p>Lee admitted that 2019 is not a good year for discrete power components suppliers, with his firm's revenues for the year likely to drop 15-16% on year due to order deferrals resulting from major Taiwanese OEM/ODM clients relocating production to cushion impacts of the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>But Lee is optimistic that Panjit's revenues for 2020 may return to 2018's level along with the launch of new SiC diodes, IGBT and shielded gate MOSFET products for automotive and industry control applications.</p>
