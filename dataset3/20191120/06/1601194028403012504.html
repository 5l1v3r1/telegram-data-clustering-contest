      <p>India is going to play its first Day-Night Test Match in Kolkata from 22nd November to 26th November. There are a lot of speculations as to what fans should expect from the match. There are also a number of questions such as how will Mayank Agarwal fare in this match who is living the dream phase of his career? Will he be able to adapt to the pink ball conditions? Will he be able to contribute for the team with the pink ball?</p>
      <p>Mayank Agarwal, who is also the brand ambassador of Fast&amp;Up, a sports nutrition and supplements brand, is known for his fitness and stamina on the field. His two double hundreds in a short international career of 8 test matches not only talk volumes about his talent but also his stamina and fitness. He banks on the fitness supplements provided by Fast&amp;Up that help in fulfilling his nutritional needs, but increases his hunger for runs.</p>
      <p>Mayank is in his dream form and has already scored two double tons out of three centuries he has scored asserting the fact that he is a big player and is the perfect match for Rohit Sharma at the top. He has now reached at number 11 in the ICC top test batsmen list which is also his career best.</p>
      <p>His first double ton came in Vizag against the South Africans where he scored 215 runs in the first innings last month. The second match of the series saw him score his second century where he scored 108 runs in Pune. He scored a total of 340 runs in 4 innings that he played in the series against South Africa.</p>
      <p>Bangladesh have become his fresh favourite opposition, against which, he scored a massive 243 runs in the first innings that became crucial for defeating the visitors by an innings and 130 runs. In this match, Mayank hit 8 sixes and 28 fours and stayed on the crease for 107.3 overs showing how fit he is and the level his stamina is at present, for which, the credit also goes to Fast&amp;Up sports nutrition supplements.</p>
      <p>Mayank has been proving himself for the past few years in domestic cricket. He also has pretty good hands on experience of playing under the lights. He also has scored 1270 runs in 77 matches in IPL at a strike rate of 128.54; many of such matches have been played under the lights.</p>
      <p>The pink ball match needs adapting to the situations quickly and it will be India’s first stint in the Day-Night Test cricket. Experts believe that the ball swings more at night and fast bowlers have an edge over the batsmen. But, the class player that Mayank is and the perseverance and stamina he has, it shouldn’t be that difficult for him to give India a memorable start in the first Day-Night test.</p>
      <p>The lacquer coating on the ball is tougher so it can be difficult for spinners to bowl. It is also worth noting that presence of dew at night can make batting easier as it becomes difficult for bowlers to control the ball. It can go in favour of batsmen if they hold up their fort during the day. The last session after tea can indeed become a run feast if the batsmen play well enough.</p>
      <p>All said, we expect Mayank to continue his form and hit a century yet again in the first Day-Night match and give his fans another reason to cheer him and get amazed with his strength and stamina, all thanks to Fast&amp;Up sports supplements.</p>
