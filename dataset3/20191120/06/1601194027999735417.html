      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> debuted on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> Backstage this week and it was one hell of a show, packed with a lot of interesting tidbits and analysis by Punk and the rest of the crew.</p>
      <p>Punk was asked by Renee Young about former Universal Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a>, who has tweeted on more than one occasion about Punk, challenging him to a match.</p>

      <p>The new member of WWE Backstage had some important and honest advice to Rollins. He said,</p>
      <blockquote>"I want my journalistic integrity to be intact, so this isn't the show where you come on and shoot your little angles. Seth (Rollins) needs to stop tweeting and realise that sometimes it's better to be viewed as the fool and shut your mouth, or open your mouth and remove all doubt."</blockquote>
