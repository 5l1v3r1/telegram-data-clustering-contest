      <p>NORMAN — Oklahoma quarterback Jalen Hurts was doing his usual post-game workout in the early hours of Sunday morning, but, this time, he had an extra focus.</p>
      <p>When the Sooners landed in Norman around 2 a.m. Sunday morning after beating Baylor 34-31, Hurts was practicing his ball security while he went through his now-routine, post-game workout.</p>
      <p>Hurts fumbled the ball three times against the Bears. He recovered the ball once, but Baylor recovered the other two.</p>
      <p>"It ain't the first time I've fumbled, and it probably won't be the last," Hurts said.</p>
      <p>One of Hurts' fumbles against Baylor came in the third quarter as he was trying to get into the end zone. The ball was stripped out of his arm before he crossed the goal line, and the Bears recovered. Afterward, Hurts acknowledged his struggle with ball security in the game.</p>
      <p>"My ball security, it sucks," Hurts said. "So I'll try to fix it."</p>
      <p>Hurts said practice and focus are the only ways to keep from fumbling. Hurts has fumbled six times this season and lost it four times, according to CBSSports.</p>
      <p>"What do shooters do when they really wanna hit shots? They keep shooting," Hurts said. "So (I) gotta keep going."</p>
