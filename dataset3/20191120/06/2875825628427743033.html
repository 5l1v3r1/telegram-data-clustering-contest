      <h2>The 1-1 draw on Monday wasn't enough to secure automatic qualification for next summer's finals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Alan Browne hopes Ireland's rousing performance against Denmark will set a template for the Euro 2020 play-offs in March. <br/><br/>The 1-1 draw on Monday wasn't enough to secure automatic qualification for next summer's finals. But the majority of supporters present at the Aviva Stadium and watching at home were encouraged by the more positive performance. <br/><br/>Of course, Ireland had to press for victory and, going into the final pool game, already knew they had the safety net of the play-offs if it didn't work out. <br/><br/>For Browne, the intensity exhibited and the clear desire to play in the right manner must be replicated in the spring - with some vital lessons absorbed and worked on. <br/><br/>"It's very disappointing for the fans, the staff, for everyone in general," said the 24-year-old. "We left everything out there. It just wasn't to be. <br/><br/>"We came out and played football, we tried to put on a performance and to create chances.</p>

      <p>"We were the better side for the majority of the game. I don't think anyone was expecting that because we haven't been good enough in this campaign, or over recent months. <br/><br/>"So we just wanted to put on a really good performance, give the fans something to get behind and cheer about. I thought we left everything out there. <br/><br/>"Hard work is a given. It's just about getting the ball down and playing. We tried to do that. <br/><br/>"No-one wants to put in a bad performance - as much as people think that sometimes we play poorly on purpose. <br/><br/>"That's not the case. We try to give our all for our team-mates, for the country in general. <br/><br/>"The hard work is a given for every player. But we just want to match the performances with that one. There are scenarios to work on and some positives to take. <br/><br/>"But there's a lot of negatives as well. We'll have to take a look and try to improve on them." <br/><br/>Pressed for the negatives, the industrious Preston midfielder instantly points to the vital concession of Martin Braithwaite's opener in the 73rd minute that left Ireland with a mountain to climb. <br/><br/>"Well, we kinda switched off for the goal," he recalled. <br/><br/>"We were slack in possession. Certainly I was one (conceding possession). It's just about getting that calmness on the ball, giving us a bit of a breather and getting us up the pitch. <br/><br/>"At this level you have to be smart as well, maybe buy a foul and it takes the pressure off. There's obviously a lot of areas to work on." <br/><br/>In fairness, he's still adjusting to life at this level. It was only Browne's second start in the campaign and his eighth cap overall at senior international level. <br/><br/>Having been selected in the engine room in midfield in the 2-0 defeat in Switzerland, he lined out on the right flank against the Danes.</p>

      <p>It was his best display yet. "I'll look back at it over the next few weeks," said the Corkman. <br/><br/>"I know there was some nervy patches, some positives and negatives. But overall it was just a good experience." <br/><br/>Another rung climbed on the ladder. "It takes some getting used to," Browne reflected. "Coming in, you can be a bit naive. <br/><br/>"You don't know what to expect. It takes time to get used to that atmosphere. <br/><br/>"But I just tried to enjoy Monday's game. Everybody wanted to - and we'll look to do that going forward as well. <br/><br/>"There are a few guys playing Prem, which wouldn't be too dissimilar. But it's certainly a massive step up for me from the Championship".</p>
