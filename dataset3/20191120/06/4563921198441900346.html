      <p>We are currently celebrating Singles’ Day — now one of the biggest shopping holidays of the year — which encourages people to relish their singlehood and pamper themselves silly! Whether you are single or not, we think it’s definitely important to engage in some #selflove — and solo <i>travelling</i> is one of the best ways to do so. </p>
      <p>There’s no doubt that solo travel can seem pretty daunting at times. Won’t I get bored and lonely? What if I get lost? The short and honest answer is yes, that’ll probably happen at some point. At the same time, that’s really all part of the experience — these ups and downs make up the most exciting adventures you’ll ever have and form memories that will stay with you for a lifetime. More importantly, solo travel brings about opportunities for you to <b>discover and love yourself</b>. You’ll finally have the chance to spend uninterrupted time with yourself and grow comfortable with your own company.</p>
      <p>Don’t wait any longer and make your solo travels a reality! Here are three tips to help you make the best of your trip:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Plan ahead</b>
      </p>
      <p>While one of the best things about traveling alone is the freedom of spontaneity, it doesn’t mean that you should show up without a plan. Take some time to research and understand the location you’re visiting and identify some main attractions that you’d like to visit. It really helps to have a rough outline of what you’ll be doing and how to get there. Additionally, make plans to meet people! Whether it is signing up for day tours or simply striking up conversations with strangers, seize the opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and connect with people from all over the world. Not only will these interactions help to quell any loneliness, but you may even meet your next best friend!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pick a comfortable location</b>
      </p>
      <p>If it’s your first time on a solo trip, your choice of location is key. Perhaps you’d like to revisit someplace that’s tried and tested, or you may prefer to explore a new destination that’s less frenetic — just so you don’t feel too overwhelmed. To get you started, we’d recommend: </p>
      <p><b>Perth, Australia</b><br/>The capital of Western Australia offers the perfect blend of a trendy urban life and relaxed nature vibes, catering to all your travel needs. Head on to <a href="https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/western-australia/doubletree-by-hilton-perth-northbridge-PERDTDI/index.html">DoubleTree by Hilton Perth Northbridge</a> to have a taste of their signature warm DoubleTree Cookie welcome, and leverage its convenient location to access attractions in the city. Stuff yourself silly with the fresh produce at the Food Markets, and, while in the sunniest city in Australia, be sure to check out the amazing beaches!</p>
      <p><b>Bangkok, Thailand</b><br/>Bangkok is one of those fail-safe destinations where everyone always has a great time! While there may be a bit of a language barrier, the locals are always quick to extend a helping hand to guide you on your way. As a solo traveler, you do have to be more mindful of where you’re staying — pick trusted hotels that are close to the main roads, such as <a href="https://conradhotels3.hilton.com/en/hotels/thailand/conrad-bangkok-BKKCICI/index.html">Conrad Bangkok</a>, to make your stay as fuss-free as possible.</p>
      <p><b>Shilim, India</b><br/>For a truly #EatPrayLove experience, look no further than <a href="https://www3.hilton.com/en/hotels/india/hilton-shillim-estate-retreat-and-spa-PNQSHHI/index.html">Hilton Shilim Estate Retreat &amp; Spa</a>. A one-and-a-half-hour drive from Pune, this retreat is nestled in an unspoiled mountain range and offers a sanctuary for your body, mind and spirit. It offers some of the most comprehensive wellness facilities in Asia, with programmes like ayurvedic therapies, jungle treks and yoga sessions. While out in nature, you’ll definitely get to spend quality time with yourself and find peace of mind.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pack light, and right</b>
      </p>
      <p>We all have a tendency to overthink and pack unnecessary things, but this time, there won’t be anyone else to help you wrestle with the bags. Keep your bags light and portable by packing just basic and solo-travel essentials — aside from functional items like a portable charger and Wi-Fi router, also remember to take along a selfie-stick to capture all your solo adventures!</p>
      <p>Now that you’re all set, get ready to discover the world <i>and</i> yourself!</p>
