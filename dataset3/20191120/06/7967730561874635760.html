      <h1>Loganlea station to be shifted as part of new infrastructure deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:05:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:05</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Moore</a></address>
      <p>Loganlea’s train station will be relocated slightly closer to the Logan Hospital as a result of the new infrastructure deal between the Queensland and Australian governments announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The station will be shifted east of Loganlea Road, next to the hospital and TAFE campuses, at a cost of $95 million, with the federal government committing $50 million.</p>

      <p>Queensland’s Infrastructure Minister and local MP Cameron Dick said the change came forward as part of new master plan for Loganlea.</p>
      <p>“This investment will make a big difference to our local community and will mean the station relocation project will finally progress,” Mr Dick said.</p>
      <p>MP Shannon Fentiman said the Loganlea station relocation was important to the fast-growing area, where the hospital is undergoing a $500 million renovation.</p>
      <p>“The new location will mean easier access for people attending the Logan Hospital, students and teachers at Loganlea TAFE and for commuters.”</p>
      <p>Until Wednesday, most of the federal government infrastructure money – promised in April’s federal budget – was more than four years into the future and outside the budget's guidelines.</p>
      <p>That brought <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p51a40.html">heavy criticism from Queensland treasurer Jackie Trad in April,</a> when she said Queenslanders needed the federal money “now”.</p>
      <p>Talks this week have resolved the timing of the funding. Funding has been brought forward and spread over the next four years.</p>
      <h3>Gold Coast extra funds</h3>
      <p>An additional $157 million has been found to bring the federal government’s contribution to $269 million for the $709 million Stage 3 – Broadbeach to Burleigh Heads – leg of the Gold Coast light rail project.</p>
      <p>The Queensland government contribution is $351 million, while the City of Gold Coast council will pay $89 million.</p>
      <p>On the Pacific Highway, there is an additional $94.3 million for M1 Pacific Motorway upgrades along three stretches of the M1.</p>

      <p>It allows work to proceed along three consecutive sections – between Eight Mile Plains and Daisy Hill, from Daisy Hill to the Logan Motorway, and from Varsity Lakes to Tugun.</p>
      <p>An additional $46 million will allow the Pimpama and Yatala exits to also continue on from the existing work.</p>
      <h3>Sunshine Coast extra funds</h3>
      <p>Bald Hills' Linkfield Road overpass of the Bruce Highway will receive $125 million, while the widening of the Pine Rivers to Caloundra stretch of the Bruce Highway share is included in $225.6 million for Bruce Highway projects. The money will begin from 2019-20. Planning is now under way.</p>
      <p>North Coast Rail (Beerburrum to Nambour) – An additional $90 million found for the $550 million upgrade of this rail line. Queensland now estimates this will cost $800 million.</p>
      <h3>Darling Downs</h3>
      <p>Around $22 million has been found to allow upgrades of the Warrego Highway from 2021.</p>
      <p>The Queensland section of Toowoomba to Seymour (Victoria) rail corridor will share in $118 million to preserve the corridor for the long-planned Melbourne to Brisbane Inland Rail corridor.</p>
      <h3>Outside Queensland’s south-east corner</h3>
      <p>Money has been bought forward to continue work on the Mackay Ring Road, the Rockhampton Ring Road and Cairns Southern Access roads.</p>
      <p>The Cooktown to Weipa road, inland roads between Townsville and Roma and Airlie Beach’s Shute Harbour Road will also receive ongoing funds.</p>
      <p>Near Bundaberg; $9 million is allocated for upgrades of the Torbanlea Pialba Road, Bargara Road and a series of overtaking lanes.</p>
