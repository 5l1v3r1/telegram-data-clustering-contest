      <p>KABUL, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Two United States service members were killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Wednesday, the U.S. military said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"The cause of the crash is under investigation, however preliminary reports do not indicate it was caused by enemy fire," the statement said.</p>
      <p>The Afghan Taliban claimed responsibility for downing the helicopter, which it said crashed in Logar province south of the capital Kabul.</p>
      <p>"US Chinook helicopter shot down and completely destroyed last night while trying to raid Mujahideen (Taliban) position in Pangram area of Sarkh, Logar," Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a tweet.</p>
      <p>It was not possible to independently verify the group's claim.</p>
      <p>The Taliban often claims responsibility for accidental crashes, and the Afghan government ruled out their involvement.</p>
      <p>"There was no involvement of the enemy fire in the helicopter crash and no Afghan security force member is hurt," said Fawad Aman, a spokesman for the Afghan defense ministry.</p>
      <p>The crash comes a day after the Taliban swapped two Western hostages for three of its commanders held by the Afghan government, raising hopes of a thaw in relations between the militant group and coalition forces.
