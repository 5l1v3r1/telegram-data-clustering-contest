      <h4>Osagie Otabor, Benin</h4>
      <p>All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman Comrade Adams Oshiomhole on Tuesday accused the Edo State Deputy Governor Philip Shaibu of betraying him.</p>
      <p>He said he stood for peace amid moves to resolve the crisis in the state chapter of the party.</p>
      <p>Various factions of the party suspended Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki, with each group passing a vote of no confidence on the other.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole said he was disappointed that Shaibu, his political son, and some others from his local government could betray him despite doing much to help them grow politically.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole, who spoke when he addressed some party supporters at his Iyamho home, urged the people to continue to embrace peace and not yield to financial inducements.</p>
      <p>He said: “The only thing I will say today to anyone who is here, who is an agent of my son – when I talk of my son, I am talking of Philip Shaibu, who now thinks that his political future requires that he attacks me and import thugs to disgrace me in my village.</p>
      <p>“Supposing I was dead after 2016 and somebody tells me that my son Philip would organise people to attack my house or to attack my village to disrupt the convocation maybe my body will be turning in heaven and I will not believe.</p>
      <p>“But the fact that I am alive to see someone who did not win his booth because his people in his village, in his community of Jattu, did not want him because they know him better than me, but I stood by him.</p>
      <p>“I stood for him, not on a false stand, and he became the deputy governor. If all that transpired now is to use that power to humiliate me but God forbid… as you can see, who can fight the battle; it is only God. So I leave the burden of guilt to them.</p>
      <p>“I will not repay evil with evil. I will stand on the path of peace. I will stand on the path of unity. I will stand on the path of justice because I know that God in heaven will never allow the evildoer to prevail.”</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole urged them to continue to support the government of President Muhammadu Buhari who he said stands for truth and justice.</p>
      <p>But Shaibu said he would never betray his political father or depart from what he learnt from him.</p>

      <p>Speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Musa Ebomhiana, Shaibu said he stood by Oshiomhole’s tenets of “no more godfatherism and Let the people lead”.</p>
      <p>He stated that as a good son of Oshiomhole’s politics, he is following the path of a good father.</p>
      <p>Shaibu described Oshiomhole as a respected leader and father he could not have betrayed.</p>
      <p>He also denied allegations that the party leaders in Estako West that signed a vote of no confidence against Oshiomhole were threatened to do so.</p>
      <p>The statement added: “The deputy governor is a gentleman. He could not have threatened or coerced anybody to sign any letter.</p>
      <p>“Those people that signed it are matured men and women who do not feed on the table of the Deputy Governor.”</p>
      <p>Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie, added that Shaibu had not in any way betrayed his political father.</p>
      <p>In a statement, he said what Shaibu was doing in the ongoing face-off is exactly what Oshiomhole taught him, which is to fight for the oppressed and downtrodden.</p>
      <p>“It is the dream of a father for his son to imbibe his principles and surpass his achievements, and that is what he has been doing.</p>
      <p>“Oshiomhole taught us activism, forthrightness, and standing for what you believe in. He is still our father and we are living by the principles he taught us.</p>
      <p>“The unfortunate thing is that for some unexplainable reasons, our father seems to be deviating from the principles which he taught us.</p>
      <p>“The real fight is against those trying to take him away from us, and others trying to shake him off the very principles he has lived by almost all his life.</p>
      <p>“His position in our lives is intact and the principles he taught us, we hold sacrosanct,” Osagie said.</p>
