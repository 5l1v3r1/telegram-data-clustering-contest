      <h1>Honor Watch Magic 2 smartwatch rolling out soon, here’s when</h1>

      <p>Honor, a Huawei subsidiary, is scheduled to announce a new smartwatch. The Honor Watch is getting a follow up in the form of the Watch Magic 2. The smartwatch is expected to be unveiled in China this coming November 26. That is less than a week from today but we have seen some images of the wearable device online. The new Honor smartwatch looks similar to the previous model but now with a thinner bezel. The bezel also looks less risen from the display.</p>
      <p>The <b>Honor Watch Magic 2</b> still looks like any ordinary smartwatch but it now appears to be more monochromatic. The all-black look makes it attractive. It’s simple and minimalist. The crown has a red ring as with the original Watch Magic model.</p>
      <p>Honor’s next-gen Watch Magic 2 <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/honor-watch-magic-2-launch-date-confirmed-and-weve-got-the-first-images">appears</a> to be more sleek and classy. The leather strap looks good in all-black. We know many people who will love the no-nonsense black watch. It can look like a classic wristwatch with a modern feel.</p>
      <p>No information on the specs and features have been provided. The official unveiling will happen in Beijing next month. It will arrive together in China with the Honor V30.</p>
      <p>We haven’t mentioned any Honor Watch lately but we remember that an <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/honor-watch-with-mediatek-chipset-in-the-works-20181217/">Honor Watch with MediaTek chipset</a> could be in the works. It is very much different now from the old <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/huawei-honor-pad-2-and-honor-watch-s1-unveiled-in-china-20161019/">Honor Watch S1</a> and Honor Magic Watch.</p>
