      <p>Analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) offers their quick reaction to the Malaysian inflation data released earlier this Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Malaysia’s inflation remained unchanged at 1.1% y/y in October. On balance, demand side inflationary pressures have been benign and our forecast for higher inflation next year primarily reflects policy changes.</p>
      <p>Considering the evolving trajectory for growth and inflation, our base case is still for a 25bp cut in the policy rate next year.</p>
      <p>It is, however, conceivable that Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) may choose to preserve its policy space after the recent cut in the statutory reserve requirement (SRR).”</p>
