      <p>Attacks by Donald Trump and top Republicans have led to a 24-hour security watch on impeachment witness Alexander Vindman.</p>
      <p>After attacks from <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and other top Republicans, Army Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman and his family have been placed under 24-hour security monitoring, according to the national Jewish newspaper <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/435068/alexander-vindman-impeachment-hearing-public-trump/"><i>The Forward</i></a>. Vindman was born a Soviet Jew but emigrated with his family to the United States when he was 3-years-old.</p>
      <p><i>The Forward</i> also reported that the United States Army has now prepared to relocate Vindman from his private home to an Army base as a security precaution after the Republican attacks. The attacks have come from <i>Fox News</i>, as well as from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee, which is leading the impeachment inquiry into whether Trump abused the power of his office.</p>
      <p>Though Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient, works in the White House as a National Security Council expert on the politics of Ukraine, the Trump White House on Tuesday distributed a lengthy list of talking points to Republicans. The list contains instructions on how they should attack Vindman, according to a report by <i><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-white-house-spreads-anti-vindman-talking-points-to-surrogates">The Daily Beast</a></i>.</p>
      <p>In the talking points, the White House accused Vindman of leaking information — a charge which Vindman dismissed as “preposterous” in his testimony — and that he “improperly accessed information he wasn’t supposed to see,” according to the <i>Daily Beast</i> report.</p>

      <p>Even as Vindman was testifying to the House impeachment inquiry in a televised, public hearing on Tuesday, the official, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5752068/donald-trump-attack-alexander-vindman-whistleblower/">taxpayer-funded White House Twitter</a> account posted an attack on Vindman, stating that “Tim Morrison, Alexander Vindman’s former boss, testified in his deposition that he had concerns about Vindman’s judgment.”</p>
      <p>Since his initial closed-door testimony late last month, Vindman has also been the target of <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5717902/republican-liz-cheney-impeachment-witness-alexander-vindman/">attacks by <i>Fox News</i></a>. Multiple <i>Fox News</i> on-air personalities have repeatedly insinuated that Vindman is somehow more loyal to Ukraine than to the United States, or that Vindman may actually be a spy for Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The attacks from <i>Fox News</i> became so extreme that the third-ranking Republican in the House, Wyoming rep Liz Cheney, condemned the questioning of Vindman’s “patriotism” as “shameful.”</p>

      <p>Trump himself has dismissed Vindman as a “Never Trumper,” according to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/471113-trump-on-vindman-i-understand-now-he-wears-his-uniform-when-he-goes"><i>The Hill</i></a>, a charge which Vindman denied in his Tuesday testimony.</p>
      <p>The testimony that sparked the attacks from Trump and his allies came when Vindman said that he understood the “favor” Trump asked of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 phone call to mean that Ukraine should open an investigation of Democrat Joe Biden — the exact alleged abuse of power for which Trump is now the subject of the House impeachment inquiry. On Tuesday, as <i>The Forward</i> reported, Vindman said that he had “no doubt” that the “favor” referred to the Trump’s desired Biden investigation.</p>
      <p>Vindman was one of the National Security Council staff members who listened in on the call between Trump and Zelensky as it was taking place. As <i>The Daily Beast</i> reported, he remains employed in the White House even as Trump other Republicans continue to attack him.</p>
