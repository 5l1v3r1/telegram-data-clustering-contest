      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): Malakoff Corp Bhd's net profit rose 13% year-on-year to RM94.49 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 from RM83.5 million on lower tax expenses incurred during the period.</p>
      <p>This brings earnings per share to 1.93 sen from 1.70 sen previously.</p>
      <p>According to the group's bourse filing, revenue for the quarter fell 3% to RM1.86 billion versus RM1.91 billion a year ago, due to lower energy payments from its Tanjung Bin Power Sdn Bhd coal plant following the plant's scheduled maintenance outage between August and October.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine months, net profit rose by 13% to RM213.75 million from RM188.95 million in the year-ago period, on the back of revenue of RM5.68 billion, up 4% year-on-year from RM5.46 billion.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, the group said it will continue to focus on enhancing the efficiency and reliability of its assets.</p>
      <p>"To this end, our Tanjung Bin Energy Plant had undertaken a 73-day scheduled outage in the first half of 2019 and its Unscheduled Outage Rate has now reduced to below 6%," it said in the filing.</p>
      <p>The group expects overall performance to remain satisfactory for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2019.</p>
      <p>At the midday break, Malakoff shares were 1.5 sen or 1.78% higher at 86 sen, for a market capitalisation of RM4.2 billion.</p>
