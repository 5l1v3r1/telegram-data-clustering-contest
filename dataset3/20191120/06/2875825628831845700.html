      <h1>Assessing the main issues facing Mick McCarthy and Ireland ahead of March play-off</h1>
      <h2>In March, it will be the ninth time the Boys in Green have gone down this particular route in the hope of reaching a European Championships or World Cup</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T06:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>One thing is for sure, Ireland won’t fear the playoffs. <br/><br/>In March, it will be the ninth time the Boys in Green have gone down this particular route in the hope of reaching a European Championships or World Cup. <br/><br/>Mind you, the record could be better with three wins and five defeats in that time. <br/><br/>But not for the first time, Ireland can have no complaints about the road they are about to embark upon. <br/><br/>Guts, determination and desire are all admirable traits and par for the course with the green shirt, but they only carry you so far. <br/><br/>Charitable reviews of Monday’s performance mask the glaring fact that Ireland struggle to win football matches that matter. <br/><br/>Since James McClean’s big winner in Cardiff 25 months ago, the team has won just three competitive games. <br/><br/>And two of those were against minnows Gibraltar and the other was a narrow home win over Georgia. It hasn’t been a great year by any stretch. <br/><br/>But Mick McCarthy insists all is not lost and is backing his team to win two back-to-back games, particularly if they play like they did on Monday. <br/><br/>McCarthy said: “The players were disappointed after the Denmark game but we’re not out of the competition. <br/><br/>“All these teams in the play-offs, they probably haven’t won two games back-to-back either, so we’re all in the same place,” added McCarthy. <br/><br/>Mirror Sport looks at the some of the issues facing McCarthy and his team going into a make-or-break week in the spring. <br/><br/><b>DOHERTY OR COLEMAN IN MARCH?</b></p>

      <p>It would be ridiculous to say that Matt Doherty has played his way into the team for the playoffs, but he certainly hasn’t done his chances any harm. <br/><br/>While his natural wing-back tendencies crept into his play and left him exposed defensively once or twice, he was solid at the back. <br/><br/>He used the ball well and became more of an attacking threat late in the game and was rewarded with his equaliser. <br/><br/>Coleman may be the captain but he has lost his place in the Everton team with on-loan Monaco man Djibril Sidibe preferred in the last two Premier League games. <br/><br/>Coleman, 30, remains an important player for Ireland but he’s also not the force he was before his horror leg break. <br/><br/>Skipper or not, if McCarthy is consistent in his approach, he will pick the player who is playing week in, week out for his club and by March that could well be Doherty. <br/><br/>“It's all hypothetical, isn't it,” said McCarthy. ‘The Doc’ was great on Monday. He played really well. <br/><br/>“We knew he was a good player and there was never anybody doubting his ability. But we don't know what March is going to bring.” <br/><br/>In March, McCarthy said he would read nothing into the win in Gibraltar because conditions were so bad and the win was all that mattered. <br/><br/>And yet Doherty’s role in this campaign was determined that day with McCarthy insisting it was a mistake to play him as a winger ahead of Coleman. <br/><br/>The Premier League’s best wing-back from last season has been a frustrated bystander but capitalised on Coleman’s suspension to lay claim to a start in March. <br/><br/>McCarthy added: “It's been a tight call all the time but my preference was Seamus. Wait and see. <br/><br/>“I'm not going to make a story of what fullback I'm going to play in March when we're in November because I don't know who will be (available then).” <br/><br/><br/><b>'GREAT TEAM SPIRIT', BUT WE NEED MORE THAN THAT</b></p>

      <p>The suggestion floated by one or two talking heads that McCarthy should make way right now for Stephen Kenny is preposterous. <br/><br/>It’s just not going to happen. McCarthy will see out this campaign whatever comes of it and Kenny will succeed him after the Euro 2020 finals as planned. <br/><br/>Whether or not you're a McCarthy fan, the standard of football on the pitch is better than what went before. <br/><br/>By no means is it perfect but Monday’s performance against Denmark proved these players are capable of playing decent stuff when the mood takes them. <br/><br/>McCarthy picked a squad off its knees after a desperately disappointing 2018 and while this year has been nothing to write home about either, it was an improvement. <br/><br/>Denmark boss Age Hareide noticed as much and said yesterday: “Definitely, there is more spirit in the side with almost the same players. <br/><br/>"The lack of spirit (last year), you could see it and there was no enthusiasm which is always there in Irish sides. <br/><br/>"I played against Irish sides myself and I know that there was always a lot of enthusiasm, they get the crowd behind the team. <br/><br/>"Now, they are really enthusiastic and I think some of the players have also improved. <br/>You see the Sheffield United players. Sheffield United are doing well in the league. <br/><br/>"A lot of the players in this side come from the Premier League and they do well and the clubs they play for also do well." <br/><br/>Hareide added: "Ireland were steady through the campaign and did well against Switzerland at home and played well against us on Monday. <br/><br/>"So it I think they have a good chance of going through (the playoffs) and I said that to Mick as well. But the play-offs are chaos.” <br/><br/><b>'ANOTHER DEFENDER SCORED….'</b></p>

      <p>Ireland have scored 17 goals in 19 games since Shane Duffy headed an early opener in the World Cup playoff with Denmark two years ago. <br/><br/>We all know what happened then, of course. But remarkably, 17 different scorers are responsible for those 17 goals. <br/><br/>The list reads: Judge, Burke, Williams, O’Brien, McClean, Hendrick, Hourihane, Duffy, Brady, McGoldrick, Browne, Long, Collins, Williams, Maguire, Robinson and Doherty. <br/><br/>The quirkiness of the stat - that emerged in the wake of Monday's game - is quite something, but the bigger issue is crystal clear. Ireland struggle to score and seven goals in the eight qualifiers just gone is woeful. <br/><br/>A team that scores so few has no right to qualify automatically, not with Denmark and Switzerland smashing 23 and 19 respectively. <br/><br/>The hope is that between now and March, Ireland’s strikers find their rhythm at club level and hit a purple patch. <br/><br/>Sean Maguire showed flashes of what he can offer against New Zealand and merited his role off the bench against Denmark.  He did well when he came on. <br/><br/>Aaron Connolly missed the game with a groin injury but the Brighton teen can become a key man with March in mind providing he continues to make inroads for his club. <br/><br/>So too can Troy Parrott. He is a natural predator and McCarthy resisted the urge to pitch him in late on Monday.   <br/><br/>He is unlikely to get too much game time in Tottenham’s first-team between now and the playoffs, and Spurs seem to rate him too highly to go on loan just yet. <br/><br/>But if they sign a new striker in the January transfer window, Parrott may indeed venture into the Championship in what would be a timely boost. <br/><br/>McCarthy said: “Let’s hope Troy gets into the team, but let’s hope he plays somewhere and gets some football, and then we’d have another one. We have some options. <br/><br/>“We'll put a team together and whoever is fit and ready to go in March, I'll pick the best team I possibly can.” <br/><br/><b>DAVID McGOLDRICK IS IRELAND'S BEST FORWARD, BUT …</b></p>

      <p>The Sheffield United forward has been Ireland’s talisman in this campaign and his injury-enforced absence against Georgia and Switzerland last month was keenly felt. <br/><br/>He probably deserved to shade the man-of-the-match award on Monday for all round effort and endeavour if nothing else. <br/><br/>At 31, McGoldrick is a short-term fix but is thriving under McCarthy having been cast aside by O’Neill. <br/><br/>He’s a clever football and links the play superbly with neatly slipped paces, deft touches or pinpoint knock downs. He will also close down space. <br/><br/>But is he really our best ‘striker’? He only has one international goal - a header against Switzerland - and is yet to get off the mark in the Premier League. <br/><br/>Against Denmark, he let fly from distance in the first-half but the shot was never on target and he slashed another over the bar after the break from a promising position. <br/><br/>For all his smart work around the box, you wouldn’t be putting your house on him finding the net all too often. <br/><br/>He lacks the predatory instincts of a Troy Parrott, who admittedly plays at a lower level, or of the Sean Maguire we saw at Cork City. <br/><br/>"I need to do better," admitted McGoldrick after Monday’s game. "I had three chances - a header, skied one and one hit my shoulder. <br/><br/>But his fitness for March is vital if Ireland are to stand any chance of reaching next summer’s showpiece. <br/><br/>McCarthy said: “I think without me answering that you all know that. He is our best striker, there is no doubt about it. <br/><br/>“That’s not being disrespectful to all of the other lads because I think they would recognise that as well. <br/><br/>“The recognise it because I keep playing him, so it’s as plain as the nose on my face. But I don’t know come March, let’s just hope he’s fit.” <br/><br/><br/><b>MAKE CHANGES IN MIDFIELD?</b></p>

      <p>Luxembourg finished second bottom of a group topped by Ukraine and Portugal, with third-placed Serbia in the playoff hunt. <br/><br/>One of European football’s minnows, they finished their campaign with 34 shots on target from their eight games. <br/><br/>From the same number of matches, Ireland clocked just 24 shots on target. It is clearly a problem. <br/><br/>But so too is creating chances and by and large the standard of crossing into the box has been disappointing. <br/><br/>James McClean worked his socks off on Monday and chased every lost cause and harried Danes off the ball, earning praise from the stands. <br/><br/>But he was so wrecked that when it came to crossing the ball into the box late on, quite often he wasn’t looking up and adopted a hit and hope approach. <br/><br/>The end result was poor. Others were guilty of it too. And for a team that relies so heavily on ‘getting a touch or a flick on something’ the balls into the mixer should be better quality. <br/><br/>Alan Browne was a safe option on the right side against Denmark but McCarthy should consider him in a central role instead of Jeff Hendrick who is not on his game. <br/><br/>Josh Cullen deserves consideration as he keeps things ticking over nicely and a game changer of Jack Byrne’s ability should not be left on the bench with 15 minutes to play. <br/><br/>But don’t bet on McCarthy ‘going for it’ in the playoffs. He is a pragmatist after all. <br/><br/>“I wasn't trying to play cagey at all,” he said of Monday’s approach to Denmark. “We were playing against a very good team and I didn't want to be 1-0 down. <br/><br/>“Oh, let’s all go gung-ho and they catch us on the break, do us and we’re 1-0 down in the first 15 minutes and the crowd is dead ad everything is dead. <br/><br/>“We probably don't have that response then. So it was important that we stayed in the game against them. <br/><br/>“There was never going to be that many chances I don't think, and we had the best one with Conor when he got in. He didn't catch it as well as he would have liked. <br/><br/>“They didn't have as much possession in the first-half as they did in Denmark and overall I keep saying it, but I'm pleased with that. <br/><br/>“All this about going with an extra striker? You know, I don't get it."</p>
