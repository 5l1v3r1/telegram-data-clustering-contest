      <p>Social media users have heaped praise on Bonds for its new Christmas ads which feature two men holding hands and kissing while wearing Bonds-branded briefs.</p>
      <p>Bonds dropped a series of Christmas ads on its Instagram page featuring the same-sex couples. The first ad was posted last week and included a gay couple laying on the ground holding hands.</p>

      <p>Another was posted several days later, featuring two men kissing in the middle of what appears to be breakfast.</p>
      <p>“It’s the little moments that make the Christmas season so special,” the caption on the photo reads.</p>

      <p>Social media users were quick to praise the brand for honoring the LGBTQ+ community.</p>
      <p>“Normalise it,” one user commented beneath the photo. “Well done Bonds.”</p>
      <p>“YAY for representing LOVE in all of its forms,” said another.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user said that the ad inspired them to buy “Bonds underwear for everybody on my list this Christmas.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Still, the post did draw some backlash.</p>
      <p>One Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/bjee77/status/1197001545235062784">called to boycott the brand</a>, calling the ads “offensive.”</p>
      <p>Another Instagram user lamented that the ad had “nothing to do with Christmas.”</p>
      <p>The brand has taken positive steps to become more inclusive in its marketing. In March, the company debuted ads featuring <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/bonds-debuted-its-first-trans-model-in-its-latest-ad-campaign-ahead-of-international-womens-day-2019-3">transgender model and activist Andreja Pejic</a> in lingerie.</p>
      <p>Judging from the largely-positive response, the strategy seems to be working.</p>
