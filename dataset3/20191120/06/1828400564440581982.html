      <h2>Fleetwood Town’s Wes Burns is enjoying the pressure of competing at the right end of League One</h2>

      <p><b>READ MORE: .</b><a href="https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sport/football/joey-barton-backing-his-fleetwood-players-to-cut-out-the-mistakes-1-10110460"><b>Joey Barton backs Fleetwood players to cut out the mistakes <br/></b></a>The winger is relishing this campaign, with Town just one point outside the play-off zone and only three behind third-placed Coventry from two fewer games.</p>
      <p>The positive results have created an environment to match at Town, whose 10-day break between games ends when Tranmere Rovers visit Highbury on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Burns told The Gazette: “Last year we were sort of there or thereabouts but a few things let us down along the way.</p>
      <p>“But this year we’re mounting a serious push for the play-offs, maybe even automatic promotion.</p>
      <p>“The pressure comes each Saturday, with us needing to win and wanting to win. We know we can’t win every game but we’ll definitely try our best.</p>
      <p>“There’s definitely a different pressure this year. We’d rather have promotion pressure than relegation pressure.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been in relegation pressure before and it’s not a nice environment to be in.</p>
      <p>“You start resenting coming to the training ground but this year it’s the complete opposite – everyone loves coming in. It’s a good environment and everyone is fighting for a place in the starting 11.</p>
      <p>“Only 11 players can start at a weekend so the competition for places breeds a good atmosphere within the group. Everyone wants everyone to do brilliantly because we all gain at the end.</p>
      <p>“If we win, we win as a team. Everyone’s rooting for us to win and head in the right direction”</p>
      <p>Town haven’t played a league fixture since losing at Bolton Wanderers on November 2.</p>
      <p>Burns would have liked last Saturday’s game at Portsmouth to have gone ahead – it was postponed due to Fleetwood’s international call-ups – and he admits Town are still working out their troubles on the road.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was quite frustrating really. Coming off the cup wins against Barnet and Oldham, we wanted to go straight into the game at Portsmouth because winning momentum is key in football.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t to be but we’re still building on those two wins. “They were very different games but the performances were very good.</p>
      <p>“We’ve talked a lot about our away form and how important it is. It hasn’t been great, we’ve highlighted that.</p>
      <p>“But to go to Barnet (in the FA Cup), put in the performance and get the result really lifted the group.</p>
      <p>“We’ve discussed it as a group and tried to put our finger on what exactly it is, but we can’t quite get it.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s just the consistency of performance. We’ve been beaten at home once in nine months.</p>
      <p>“We just need to mirror those performances away and go into away games with the same mentality we have at home.</p>
      <p>“Those away wins will come and we’ll be fine.”</p>
