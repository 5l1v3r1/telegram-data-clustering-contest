      <p>NORMAN — University of Miami Professor Bruce Bagley was one of the final witnesses in the state opioid trial, testifying in July for pharmaceutical giant Johnson &amp; Johnson as an expert on drug cartels.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Bagley, 73, was arrested in Florida after being accused in a federal indictment of laundering dirty money into the United States from a Venezuelan bribery and corruption scheme.</p>
      <p>"Bagley ... allegedly opened bank accounts for the express purpose of laundering money for corrupt foreign nationals," U.S. Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman said in New York City on Monday after the arrest. "About the only lesson to be learned from Professor Bagley today is that involving oneself in public corruption, bribery and embezzlement schemes is going to lead to an indictment."</p>
      <p>The professor is accused in the indictment of accepting $3 million into his own bank accounts and then laundering most of it into the accounts of a co-conspirator "to conceal the nature, source and ownership of the funds." He is accused of taking a 10% cut for himself.</p>
      <p>He and his co-conspirator discussed the fact that they were moving funds on behalf of a Colombian individual that were "stolen from the Venezuelan people," a federal grand jury in New York City alleged in the indictment. "Bagley entered into multiple sham contracts purporting to justify the transfer of money into his account in the course of the money-laundering conspiracy."</p>
      <p>Grand jurors returned the indictment in October charging him with two money laundering counts and one conspiracy count. “I’m feeling just fine. Not guilty. That’s how I’m feeling. They’ve got it all wrong," he told CBS Miami on Monday.</p>
      <p>The scheme began in November 2017 when he began accepting $200,000 a month from a "food company" in the United Arab Emirates, according to the indictment.</p>
      <p>The scheme ended this year, in April, after investigators conducted a sting operation, according to the indictment. By that time, Bagley had been preparing for months for his testimony in the state opioid trial.</p>
      <p>Bagley, an international studies professor, has been a sought-after expert for both lawyers and journalists for years. He co-edited and helped write the 2015 book, "Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime and Violence in the Americas Today." He has worked as a consultant for the FBI, CIA, Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal agencies.</p>
      <p>In his lengthy testimony in the state case July 11, Bagley said brutal Mexican and Colombian cartels are to blame for the deadly drug abuse problem in Oklahoma, not regulated U.S. pharmaceutical companies.</p>
      <p>"This is a huge industry and it has been growing steadily," he said of the drug smuggling from those countries.</p>
      <p>Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman rejected that testimony in finding against Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries. He ruled in August that Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries are at fault in the state's opioid crisis.</p>
      <p>The judge specifically found their "false, misleading and dangerous marketing campaigns have caused exponentially increasing rates of addiction, overdose deaths and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome."</p>
      <p>The judge last week ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson and its subsidiaries to pay the state $465 million to address the crisis.</p>
      <p>Taking note of the arrest was Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter, who sued Johnson &amp; Johnson and other drug companies in 2017 on behalf of the state.</p>
      <p>"The arrest of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s expert witness on crime and corruption in South America for allegedly participating in an international money laundering scheme in Venezuela speaks for itself,” Hunter said Tuesday.</p>
