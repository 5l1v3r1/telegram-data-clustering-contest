      <p>Romantic comedy Motichoor Chaknachoor has failed to impress critics as well as the audience. And now the director of the movie, Debamitra Biswal, has distanced herself from the project saying that this was not the film she had envisioned.</p>
      <p>Stating that the viewers should watch the Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Athiya Shetty film at their own risk, the filmmaker wrote on social media, “Now that the film is finally releasing, I would like to tell everyone that this has been the toughest journey of my life. But unfortunately not the best one at the end. We all from the actors to the technicians to everyone involved in the film made this film with immense love and hard work…Everyone who has worked in a film knows very well how important an edit is for a film. Sticking shots together does not make a film. I wish important decision makers of the film could have understood this. But I will always be grateful to the beautiful souls who helped me complete this film but sadly no one can watch the magic that we created.”</p>
      <p>“Thank you Chandan Arora for showing me how a great film is made on the edit table. Thank you for editing it beyond beautiful. Sadly the world is not seeing our work,” she added.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker then goes on to thank the cast and crew of the film before advising viewers to watch Motichoor Chaknachoor at their own risk.</p>
      <p>“Sorry I could not save the film. We know what great potential it had. But I guess sometimes things get ruined even after lot of honesty put in. I still wish I could show the world what I had made. Thank you Sohaib for taking all this pain since last three years and still standing by me like a rock. Your support is beyond measure. I might have fallen short on luck with this film but definitely beyond grateful to god to bless me you as my husband. Sorry I could not make you proud this time. Lastly, very important notice to all near and dear ones, it’s OK if you still want to watch the film but go at your own risk. I will not be responsible for your bheja fry. An experience definitely as sweet as Motichoor, but an outcome is total Chaknachoor,” the post stated.</p>
      <p>According to various reports, the director has also requested for her name to be not used in the credits.</p>
