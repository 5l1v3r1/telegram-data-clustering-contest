      <p>Taiwan-based backend equipment supplier All Ring Tech is optimistic about its business prospect for 2020 as it has tapped into the supply chains of Taiwan's leading wafer foundry and backend service firms as well as a handset vendor in the US, ready to cash in on growing demand for advanced IC packaging equipment for processing 5G, AI and HPC chip solutions, according to company vice president CT Lee.</p>
      <p>Lee noted All Ring has ventured its underfill dispensing machines, diverse mounters, and six-side AOI (automated optical inspection) machines into the backend CoWoS and InFO process equipment supply chain into Taiwan's top foundry house.</p>
      <p>Lee said that market demand for advanced packaging and testing materials and equipment is expected to maintain an annual growth of 20% in the next five years, and his company is expected to benefit from the demand.</p>
      <p>Industry sources said that the firm's revenue ratio for customized equipment for CoWoS and InFo processes now reaches about 10% and is expected to pick up steadily in 2020.</p>
      <p>Also, All Ring has secured stable orders for substrate-based SiP equipment from ASE Technology Holding and indirectly ventured its 3D sensor chips packaging equipment into the supply chain of iPhones through international optical components maker AMS, with shipments likely to kick off in the second quarter of 2020, the sources said.</p>
