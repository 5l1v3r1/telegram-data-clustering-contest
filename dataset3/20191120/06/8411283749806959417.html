      <p>Chin-Poon Industrial remains cautious about demand for automotive electronics, which is unlikely to pick up until 2020, according to the PCB manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Chin-Poon has as high as 80% of revenues generated from the automotive electronics sector. Automotive PCB demand has been sluggish since the third quarter of 2018, said the Taiwan-based company, adding that unsatisfactory capacity utilization is hurting its profitability.</p>
      <p>Chin-Poon said it continues to see its clients remain cautious about placing orders. Chin-Poon's performance next year will depend on the visibility of orders for ADAS and other high-end automotive electronics segments, the company indicated.</p>
      <p>Chin-Poon will be striving to raise its factory utilization rates and also improve its product mix for profitability, the auto PCB specialist noted.</p>
      <p>Chin-Poon reported net profit fell 34% from a year earlier to NT$316 million (US$10.4 million) in the third quarter of 2019, with EPS coming to NT$0.80. Chin-Poon disclosed its cumulative 2019 revenues through October decreased 13.2% on year to NT$15.04 billion.</p>
