        <b>Riding his motorbike along Choa Chu Kang Link, Mr Faliq Shazwin Alwi saw a man being chased by two others and thought they were gang members.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He stopped to help and wanted to use his helmet to hit one of them when he saw him pin the man to the ground.</p>
      <p>But just as he was about to do so, he realised they were plainclothes police officers, and they were arresting an Indonesian suspected of dealing in illegal cigarettes.</p>
      <p>So, Mr Faliq, 22, helped them pin the man down.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Mr Faliq was one of four recipients of the Public Spiritedness Award held at the Woodlands Police Division.</p>
      <p>Recalling the incident, the full-time delivery rider said he was riding home at about 2am on Aug 28 when he saw the chase.</p>
      <p>He said one of the two men tripped so he tried to help the man they were chasing.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media, Mr Faliq said: "I felt helpless and I wanted to use my helmet against the officer before he identified himself as the police.</p>
      <p>"I was hesitant to believe the officer at first, but I eventually switched sides and helped the officer detain him."</p>
      <p>The suspect, who could speak only basic English, could not answer the officer's questions until Mr Faliq translated it into Bahasa Indonesia for him.</p>
      <p>The suspect was arrested for an offence under the Immigration Act and possession of duty-unpaid cigarettes.</p>
      <p>Two other recipients of the award were Ms Cheo Yi Love, 25 and Mr Roy Cheong, 46.</p>
      <h3>SUSPICIOUS</h3>
      <p>Ms Cheo, a service executive at the United Overseas Bank's Woodlands branch, got suspicious when she realised her customer, a 61-year-old woman, wanted to cash out $12,500 only to cash it back into a third party account. It was Ms Cheo's first month on the job.</p>
      <p>She said: "She (the victim) kept rushing the procedure, wanting to get it done as soon as possible. She also looked very nervous."</p>
      <p>Mr Cheong, the branch's deputy manager, realised it might be a scam and helped the victim lodge a police report.</p>
      <p>The woman had befriended a man online who asked for $3,500 to receive a parcel. He then asked for another $12,500 to get a clearance certificate for the parcel.</p>
      <p>Another Public Spiritedness Award ceremony was held at the Clementi Police Division yesterday. Two members of the public were honoured for helping to detain a shoplifter and for detaining a man who had stolen something placed outside his neighbour's unit.</p>
      <p>Assistant Commissioner of Police Leon Chan, Commander of Woodlands Police Division said in a statement: "They (award recipients) are examples of how people keep a watchful eye out for potential victims of crime, or bravely step up to assist the police.</p>
      <p>"We hope that their actions will serve to inspire others to keep their communities safe."</p>
