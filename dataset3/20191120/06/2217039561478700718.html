      </p>
      <p>Ireland needed to beat Denmark in Dublin to clinch qualification for next year's 24-team European Championship Finals, but Matt Doherty's late header was only enough to earn Mick McCarthy's men a 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium.</p>
      <p>A closely fought contest, low on technical quality, swung the visitors' way when the unmarked Martin Braithwaite stuck out a boot to divert a Henrik Dalsgaard cross into the net on 73 minutes.</p>
      <p>Doherty equalised five minutes from time, but Denmark held on to clinch second place in the group behind Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Said Ireland manager McCarthy: "They have been brilliant. We lost one game out of eight. I am very proud of them. We can beat anyone in the play-offs."</p>
      <p>Switzerland, meanwhile, secured top spot with a 6-1 away win against minnows Gibraltar as Cedric Itten scored twice.</p>
      <p>Granit Xhaka, Ruben Vargas, Christian Fassnacht and Loris Benito also found the net for the Swiss, with Reece Styche grabbing Gibraltar's consolation goal. - AFP</p>
