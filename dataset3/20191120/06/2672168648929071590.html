      <p>Two Bangladeshi youths were shot dead by Indian Border Security Force (BSF) in Babelakona border of Sherpur on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The dead -- Ukil Miah, 25, a college student, and Khokon Miah, 25, a businessman, were friends. They both hailed from Sreebardi upazila in the district, police said.</p>
      <p>While roaming around the areas of Ukil’s father-in-law’s home at Babelakona, the youths might have crossed the border and stepped into Indian soil, said Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) officials.</p>
      <p>Company Commander Khandakar Abdul Hai of Kornojhora BGB camp said they were shot dead by the members of Ringkhingpara BSF camp in India’s Meghalaya state.</p>
      <p>The body of Ukil was found in Panibari area around 8:00am, while Khokon’s body was found floating in the Kornojhora river around 3:00pm, said the BGB official.</p>
      <p>“They probably ran to save their lives after hearing the sound of firing,” he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BGB protested the killing and sat in a flag meeting with the company commander of Ringkhingpara BSF camp, he added.</p>
      <p>Ruhul Amin, officer-in-charge of Sreebardi Police Station, said the bodies were sent to Sherpur Sadar Hospital morgue for autopsies.</p>
      <p>A general diary was lodged with the police station in this connection, the OC said.</p>
