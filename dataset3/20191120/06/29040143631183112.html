      <ul>
        <li>Amazon has launched the Echo Flex in India.</li>
        <li>The plug-in smart speaker can now be pre-ordered online for ₹2,999 ($42).</li>
        <li>For a limited period, consumers in the country will be able to get a Wipro Smart LED bulb (9W) along with the Echo Flex at no additional cost.</li>

      <p>Amazon today launched the Alexa-enabled <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/weird-flex-ok">Echo Flex</a> in India. The Echo Flex is a plug-in smart speaker that offers pretty much the same functionality as other Echo speakers from the company.</p>
      <p>The Amazon Echo Flex is now available for pre-order on Amazon.in for ₹2,999 ($42). Amazon says the compact plug-in smart speaker will begin shipping sometime next month. As part of a limited period offer, customers in India can get a 9W Wipro smart LED bulb worth ₹2,099 ($29) at no additional cost when purchasing the Echo Flex.</p>
      <p>Unlike most other smart speakers, the Echo Flex can be plugged directly to a standard power outlet. Its compact size makes it ideal for places where there isn't enough space for larger smart speakers. With Alexa built-in, you will be able to access a world of information, check the weather, make calls hands-free, create daily reminders, check the news, and much more.</p>
      <p>The Echo Flex is also compatible with <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-smart-lights-work-alexa">smart lights</a> and plugs from leading brands such as Philips, SYSKA LED, Oakter, TP-Link, and more. Once paired, you will be able to control them using just your voice. It includes a USB-A port as well, which can be used to charge your phone or add optional accessories.</p>
