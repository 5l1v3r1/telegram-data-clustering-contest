      <p>Cineworld has had a leak in its roof - just weeks after the stunning new multiplex cinema opened.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, a cinemagoer contacted Plymouth Live saying they had spotted a leaking roof during a visit and claimed that the incident blocked off access to some screens.</p>
      <p>Photos show wet floor signs and visible damage to a roof fixture.</p>
      <p>However, a spokesperson for Cineworld has since confirmed that the leak was in fact in the section of the corridor where the projection rooms are based, and not an area open to customers.</p>

      <p>The spokesperson said: "Cineworld Plymouth can confirm a leak was reported to us and is being dealt with.</p>
      <p>"No screenings are currently being affected and we are operating as normal.”</p>
      <p>Since The Barcode opened last month, visitors of the new Cineworld have been leaving a mixture of reviews.</p>
      <p>The new cinema, complete with 12 screens including IMAX and 4DX screens, opened its doors to the public on Tuesday, October 22 as part of Drake Circus' £53 million leisure complex The Barcode.</p>

      <p>The multiplex doesn’t have a box office, movie posters or projectionists – but boasts the world’s most advanced cinema technology, a coffee shop and ice cream bar, and a ticketing deal that allows you to see movies as many times as you want for a fixed monthly price.</p>
      <p>As cinemagoers have flocked to try out the new screens, the complex has a score of 2.5 stars on Trip Advisor at present, with more negative reviews than positive.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "I was told that IMAX was the bomb but was truly awful. £4.20 for popcorn in a tiny bag like what you get your large chips from burger king in.</p>

      <p>"Seats are so cramped, you can't get out to go toilet, we walked in and the seats were dirty and messy from the previous show, left over popcorn, drinks, rubbish and the seat was sticky.</p>
      <p>Another said: "The staff are friendly and the sound and picture was quite good. However, the seats were so uncomfortable I still have backache the next day.</p>

      <p>"The seats are best described as miniature armchairs that recline by leaning back. My seat was reclining when I didn't want it to, and the legroom was appalling.</p>
      <p>"I've had more legroom in economy on a plane. It was also so hot in the screen that I was starting to feel a bit queasy."</p>
      <p>However, on Facebook, the cinema currently has a rating of 4.1 out of 5, with the majority seemingly impressed by the new venue.</p>
      <p>One user, who recommends visiting, said: "Great place to watch a movie. The ambiance is top notch. Great sound and picture quality.</p>
      <p>"The 4DX and IMAX are incredible. Awesome location. In the heart of the city. Very convenient for shoppers, and people that can only take public transportation. 10 out of 10 from me."</p>
      <p>Another said: "I was impressed with how much of a smooth operation my first visit was. Very friendly staff, easy to buy tickets (you can buy on the screens with your card as you come in, or pay by cash upstairs.)</p>
      <p>"The seats are comfortable and recline, and the toilets are spotlessly clean."</p>
