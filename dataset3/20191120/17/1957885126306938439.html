      <h1>Borderlands 3's first campaign DLC is Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot</h1>
      <h2>And it's coming in December.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:57:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Wales</a></address>
      <p>Borderlands 3's first campaign-based paid DLC has been revealed. It's called Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, and it's coming to PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 on 19th December.</p>
      <p>Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, as you might well assume, focusses its narrative eye on Moxxi, the fancy-hatted ringmaster of Borderlands' Underdome.</p>
      <p>This time around, she's assembling a crew to plunder the derelict space station casino of the title - one "packed with unique zones worthy of Handsome Jack's lavish lifestyle and dirty dealings" but now on full lockdown following his untimely demise.</p>
      <p>It's a mission that will require players to go up against Hyperion security forces and crazed casino patrons, as well as "never-before-seen enemies and larger-than-life bosses". The reward for this misadventure is a safe that's "loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot".</p>

      <p>Elaborating further, Gearbox says that players will be able to get their hands on Vault Hunter heads and skins as part of the DLC, alongside weapon trinkets, an ECHO device skin, and new emotes. However, in order to access the new campaign, eager adventurers will first need to have worked their way to Sanctuary III in the main game.</p>
      <p>The new story DLC is tuned for players who've reached at least level 13, but Gearbox notes that enemies and loot onboard the casino will scale, ensuring that its heist missions and new Crew Challenges "are suitably difficult and rewarding", even for higher-level Vault Hunters.</p>
      <p>Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot - the first of four planned DLC campaigns - will be available as part of Borderlands 3's Season Pass, and is included in the game's Super Deluxe Edition. Presumably it'll also be available to purchase separately at launch, although Gearbox doesn't appear to have said as much just yet.</p>

      <p>In other Borderlands 3 news, the developer will be releasing a fresh batch of free new content aimed at seasoned players in the game's next update.</p>
      <p>There's Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite, described as a "raid-style challenge tuned for coordinated co-op parties of four max-level characters", alongside Mayhem 4. The latter will enable fearless sorts to ramp up Mayhem Mode's difficulty even higher than before, and offers its own exclusive Legendary gear. A few more details on Borderlands 3's currently undated free update can be <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-20-moxxi-s-heist-of-the-handsome-jackpot/">found in Gearbox's latest blogpost.</a>.</p>
      <p>And finally, if you've not yet taken the plunge with Borderlands 3, the well-received looter-shooter will be free to try on Xbox One and PS4 from Thursday, 21st November, until Sunday, 24th November. Any progress made can be transferred over to the full game if so desired.</p>
