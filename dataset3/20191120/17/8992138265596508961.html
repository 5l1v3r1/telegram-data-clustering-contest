      <h1>Circle’s USDC Circulating Supply Rises 50% YTD to $464 Million</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:21:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Aziz Abdel-Qader</a></address>
      <p>Circle, the company behind US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, released its latest audit report, which was signed by the leading auditor firm Grant Thornton. The “attestation report” states that the Goldman-funded startup has sufficient capital to back each individual token on a 1:1 basis.</p>
      <p>According to the report published today, 464,507,005 USDC tokens were issued and outstanding on October 31, 2019, while the company holds $464,628,070 in deposits. The firm then concluded that Circle’s assets show an excess of $121,000 in fiat reserves.</p>

      <p>Compared to <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/circles-usdc-monitor-audits-10-billion-in-crypto-in-q1-2019/">previous reports</a>, the figure is up by more than 50% on a YTD basis from $307 million reported earlier in January’s report.</p>

      <p>Coinbase has boosted USDC dominance by making it the only way to convert fiat to crypto without fees on its institutional platform, Coinbase Pro. In addition, San Francisco-based exchange has recently launched ‘<a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/coinbase-now-allows-usdc-hodlers-earn-1-2-annual-interest/">USDC Rewards</a>, ’ which enables US customers to earn 1.2 percent a year compounded monthly by simply storing Circle’s stablecoin in their accounts.</p>
      <h3>Tether concedes its dominance</h3>
      <p>The lack of a clear audit of reserves in the crypto ecosystem has caused much discussion and controversy, particularly with regards to so-called <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/coins/stablecoins-might-be-stable-but-are-they-actually-coins/">stablecoins</a> since they effectively act as a custodian for exchanges that are not provided traditional banking services.</p>
      <p>Onboarding a major accounting firm that can be held accountable by third parties for financial information to engage in an audit of a crypto token is also a notable success for Circle’s initiative. The move is important due to nagging questions around <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/teether-releases-50-million-new-tokens-bitfinex-volumes-down-34-percent/">Tether’s major stablecoin</a>, which has been dogged by speculation that it holds insufficient capital to support its over $4.1 billion market cap of USDT.</p>
      <p>USDC has widened its percentage of total stablecoin supply in circulation to nearly 10 percent. The gains come as Tether conceded its dominance to other alternatives including Circle’s coin, Paxos Standard, and the Gemini Dollar.</p>
