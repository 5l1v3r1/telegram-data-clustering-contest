      <p>The Fox News anchor Bret Baier said testimony on Wednesday from Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11">impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump</a> was "very damaging" to the Republican Party's arguments.</p>
      <p>Sondland <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gordon-sondland-confirm-quid-pro-quo-in-opening-statement-2019-11">confirmed a quid pro quo</a> with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gordon-sondland-throws-trump-under-the-bus-in-impeachment-testimony-2019-11">implicated several other government officials</a>, including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and John Bolton, the former national security adviser.</p>
      <p>He also testified that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sondland-trump-ordered-me-work-rudy-giuliani-ukraine-impeachment-hearing-2019-11">Trump instructed him to work with his lawyer Rudy Giuliani</a> to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>In a break from the hearings, Baier said Sondland's 23-page opening statement and testimony that "everyone was in the loop" regarding the quid pro quo was "very damaging to some of the arguments the GOP has been making."</p>
      <p>He later tweeted a statement from the lead prosecutor in President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Ken Starr.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/471292-ken-starr-says-its-obviously-been-a-bombshell-day-in-impeachment">Starr told Fox News</a> that the position of Rep. Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, was that "we now know that the president, in fact, committed the crime of bribery."</p>
      <p>Starr added that "this obviously has been one of those bombshell days."</p>

      <p>Baier was also critical of the president during last week's testimony from Marie Yovanovitch. After the president <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bret-baier-impeachment-inquiry-marie-yovanovitch-adam-schiff-twitter">tweeted a critical statement about Yovanovitch</a> during the hearing, <a href="https://twitter.com/BretBaier/status/1195364536326541313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195364536326541313&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.knoe.com%2Fcontent%2Fnews%2FFox-News-anchor-calls-out-Trump-attack-on-Yovanovich-565003402.html">Baier said</a> Trump's actions were "adding an article of impeachment" in "real-time."</p>
