      <p>Jose Mourinho's <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/message-tottenham-manchester-jose-mourinho-manager-know-story/">dramatic arrival</a> at Tottenham Hotspur has already been caught on film by Amazon Prime's fly-on-the-wall series, which airs next year.</p>
      <p>The fallout surrounding Mauricio Pochettino's departure and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-names-joao-sacramento-assistant-manager-tottenham/">the arrival</a> of one of football's most high-profile managers is a box office dream for the subscription broadcaster, which agreed multimillion pound terms with Daniel Levy over the summer.</p>
      <p>In an early coup for the streaming service, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-manager-replace-mauricio-pochettino/">Mourinho</a> is understood to have stopped immediately to answer questions on camera shortly after arriving for the first time at <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/will-spurs-play-josewhat-mourinho-can-bring-tottenham-tactical/">the club's Enfield Training Centre</a>.</p>
      <p>The timing of his arrival has particularly delighted the broadcaster as it had secured live and exclusive coverage of what is certain to become his most intriguing early game in charge: away to Manchester United on December 4.</p>
      <p>Last year Mourinho poked fun at a previous "All or Nothing" series Amazon made with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>“You can be a rich club and buy all the best players in the world but you cannot buy class,” he said last year after City’s commercial deal with the on-demand streaming service. “Because I am in the movie I could ask for some royalties.”</p>
      <p>Since leaving United last season, the 56-year-old has been working periodically as a pundit for Sky Sports. Spurs did not need to buy him out of any broadcasting commitments as he was working on a match-by-match basis, it is understood.</p>
      <p><i>All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur</i>will also focus on the development of the club's new stadium, its impact on the local community in north London and the club's growing relationship with the NFL, who will stage two regular season games each year at Tottenham for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>The series will launch on Prime Video next year in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide. Every member of the squad, despite some players expressing private misgivings over the series, is obliged by their club contracts to co-operate.</p>
      <p>Georgia Brown, director of European originals at Amazon, previously said the broadcaster is "delighted to be embarking on this journey with Spurs and delivering another extraordinary look at one of the most exciting teams in the Premier League".</p>
      <p>City, Leeds United and Borussia Dortmund have already allowed cameras behind the scenes for Amazon Prime access. Other sides such as Juventus and Sunderland have provided entertaining content for streaming rivals Netflix, the latter suffering relegation to Sky Bet League One while the cameras were rolling.</p>
