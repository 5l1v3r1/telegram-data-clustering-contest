      <h1>Tory Lanez Thinks Rap Music Is “In A Horrible Place” Due To Repetitive Sounds &amp; Subject Matter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:19:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Tory-lanez">Tory Lanez</a> is known for blending R&amp;B and hip-hop, but as his rap battles last year proved, he can still spit. The Canadian rapper reminded fans of that fact when discussing the state of rap music during a recent interview with Hot97. According to Tory, too much of hip-hop sounds too similar for his liking, and there isn’t enough substance in the lyrics.</p>
      <p>“Rap is in a horrible place. You gotta look at it right now. What’s the best rap song you’ve heard right now?” he asked “I just feel like rap has gotten to a repetitive place where there’s this one sound right now that’s like it sounds like it’s out of an automated box. And it’s just like, ‘Let’s just go on it, put a bunch of Auto-Tune on it. Hood nigga beat. Hood nigga song. It’s good to go.’”</p>
      <p>After Ebro pointed to artists like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/A-boogie-wit-da-hoodie">A Boogie Wit da Hoodie</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Roddy-ricch">Roddy Ricch</a>, Tory said that the problem is more in artists that copy their style.</p>
      <p>“At least with them, the substance within the pockets that they hit is at least a little bit [better],” he said. “Of course we all draw sounds and inspirations from each other. I’ve been one of the people who have done that too, I’ll never take anything from it. But at the same time, I feel like when everybody starts to sound the same, and I keep hearing the same drum and the same kick and the same snare and the same hi-hats and the same patterns, it gets to a point where I start saying, ‘Yo, this shit is in a bad place right now.’”</p>
      <p>He’s hardly the first rapper to bemoan the state of hip-hop. Last year, <a href="https://genius.com/a/asap-ferg-when-nas-said-hip-hop-was-dead-he-was-onto-something">A$AP Ferg cosigned Nas' infamous “hip-hop is dead”</a> declaration. In 2017, <a href="https://genius.com/a/pusha-t-doesn-t-think-lyricism-is-as-important-in-hip-hop-anymore">Pusha-T said that lyricism “isn’t as important”</a> as it once was. And both <a href="https://genius.com/15288192">Eminem</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/a/j-cole-on-which-rapper-he-s-targeting-with-1985-it-s-really-a-shoe-fits-situation">J. Cole</a> took new rappers to task in 2018 on their respective tracks, <a href="https://genius.com/Eminem-the-ringer-lyrics">“The Ringer”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/J-cole-1985-lyrics">“1985.”</a></p>
      <p>Even <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Dr-dre">Dr. Dre</a> weighed in recently, saying “right now, it feels like it’s a little more quantity over quality. ‘Made a song last night, I need to put it out tomorrow,‘” in an <a href="https://genius.com/a/dr-dre-says-hip-hop-is-producing-more-quantity-over-quality-right-now">interview with Apple Music</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, the comments are interesting to hear from Tory. Although he <a href="https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-declares-himself-the-best-rapper-alive-right-now">declared himself the best rapper alive</a> back in January, the Toronto MC is primarily known for his Auto-Tuned, singing-heavy music. His recent release, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Tory-lanez/Chixtape-5"><i>Chixtape 5</i></a>, found him flipping old-school R&amp;B tracks.</p>
