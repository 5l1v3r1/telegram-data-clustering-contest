      <h1>Councillors grill director over botched process</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jolyon Attwooll</a></address>
      <p>A technical hitch - the first since council meetings were beamed live in May - may have been a comfort for the City of Ballarat's director of business services Glenn Kallio on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>With an interrupted broadcast, regular viewers would have missed councillors fire a series of questions at Mr Kallio about a botched delegation of powers to the chief executive officer, Justine Linley.</p>
      <p>Transparency advocate and former mayor John Barnes <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6493656/ballarat-city-council-decisions-at-risk-due-to-alleged-breach-of-local-government-act/">last week highlighted a breach of the local government act</a>, which he said potentially put hundreds of council decisions at risk.</p>
      <p>For an elected council to allow a CEO to act on their behalf, a formal process using a resolution and a document known as an "instrument of delegation" is required.</p>
      <p>Law dictates a review of delegations within 12 months of a new council, but this did not happen after the October 2016 elections. In a last-minute twist, an officer recommendation to revoke the previous delegation - initially set down for as August 2016 - was changed to a 2014 date. It effectively acknowledged there had been two breaches - and that Ms Linley had never formally been delegated powers.</p>
      <blockquote>This isn't a golden moment in local government administration.<cite>Councillor Mark Harris</cite></blockquote>
      <p>However, Mr Kallio said legal advice from two sets of lawyers suggested there were no financial or legal risks as the previous 2014 delegation had no "sunset" clause. Effectively, he said, it was just an error in timeline and the delegation to the previous CEO would simply flow on to the next incumbent.</p>
      <p>Asked why no background on the legal advice was given to councillors, he said the item was put on the agenda to correct the error. "In such a report you don't normally put down that you have sought legal advice," he said.</p>
      <p>"We seem to be changing stuff on the fly here," Cr Grant Tillett responded. "Frankly I am appalled. This has put me at risk in my view....How can it be completely legal if it is in breach of the act?"</p>
      <p>He said he believed the agenda item had been "slipped in", and that councillors should have had a "very serious briefing".</p>
      <p>Mr Kallio said the delegation was valid as it was "delegated to the CEO not to the person...We have not met a timeline, that is it." He said that since that oversight the governance unit had been "rebuilt from scratch" and no further errors had occurred.</p>
      <p>When asked by Cr Jim Rinaldi for her view on the matter, Ms Linley acknowledged "significant process issues" when the original delegation was due to be put in place in August 2016, but said those had now been rectified.</p>
      <blockquote>We need to make sure we are across these issues. This has been a wake-up call for that<cite>Cr Des Hudson</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Cr Mark Harris, who earlier had described the issue as a "simple c*ck-up", struck a different tone following the late amendment. "This isn't a golden moment in local government administration. We have failed - and we acknowledge that and we acknowledge that openly," he said. However, he said it was a "complete nonsense" to suggest anyone would bring a case against the councillors due to the error.</p>
      <p>Councillor Des Hudson also said there was no suggestion the delegations had been misused. "We need to move on and set the record straight," he said. "We need to make sure we are across these issues. This has been a wake-up call for that."</p>
      <h3>PETITIONS</h3>
      <p>Two petitions were considered last night including one from residents of Parade Court off Wendouree parade requesting their road be made parking permit only.</p>

      <p>The second petition had 19 signatures and was a request from rural residents to ban roosters from rural properties, a suggestion that provoked a lot of feedback from readers of The Courier. The current local law stipulates roosters can be kept on rural properties but not in urban residential zones.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Councillors voted to receive both and refer them to the CEO for a response.</p>
      <h3>BUNINYONG ROYAL PARKÂ </h3>
      <p>Council has moved to take back control of the management of the Buninyong Royal Park. At the moment, it is managed by the "Friends of Buninyong Royal Park". However, with council plans to install a new female friendly facility, two soccer pitches and new LED lighting, it needs to have formal management of the site.</p>
      <p>Councillors approved office advice to lodge a request to change the management status of the area, which is on crown land, with the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning. The motion was amended slightly at the suggestion of Cr Hudson to ensure the Friends of Buninyong Park are involved in future consultation.</p>
      <h3>Tourism grants</h3>
      <p>Three separate tourism grants were agreed during the course of the council meeting on Wednesday evening. They were as follows:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rock Ballarat</b>
      </p>
      <p>The event that will replace the old Ballarat Beat Rockabilly Festival, held for the time earlier this year, will receive $60,000 over the next three years as per the council officers' recommendation.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The funds will be used to help with road closures as well as venue and equipment hire. A new events company, SBK Events Pty Ltd, was set up this year to fill the gap left by the previous festival organisers.</p>
      <p>The event, which will showcase the best rockabilly and rock 'n' roll culture, including car displays, dancing, music, as well as food stalls, will take place from February 5 to 7 next year. It will expand on previous years, including events staged in the Civic Hall, the Mining Exchange and Armstrong Street North, which will be closed off.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>
            <a href="https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/6407072/a-new-festival-set-to-bring-back-ballarats-rocking-charm/">Rocking charm gets a reprieve with a new look and bigger festival heading to Ballarat in February</a>
          </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first tranche of $25,000 will be allocated for the 2019/20 event followed by $20,000 for the 2020/21 and $15,000 for 2021/22.</p>
      <blockquote>Businesses are really grateful you guys have come forward to fill that void<cite>Cr Daniel Moloney</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Cr Daniel Moloney said there had been concerns about trade during February when there were doubts about the future of the festival. He told organiser Tracey Spencer businesses were "really grateful you guys have come forward to fill that void".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Beer Festival</b>
      </p>

      <p>The week after the Rock Ballarat festival, another event will also benefit from a council tourism grant. The Beer Festival is scheduled for February 15, and will receive a total of $11,840. It will bring an estimated $416,560 into the local economy, an assessment suggests. It has been voted 'Australia's Most Popular Craft Beer Event', by craft beer enthusiasts for three consecutive years.</p>
      <p>Cr Samantha McIntosh highlighted that 70 per cent of visitors came from outside of Ballarat, and said the event helped create a "vibrant and interesting CBD".</p>
      <p>
        <b>Beer Hop</b>
      </p>
      <p>On a similar theme, seed funding was granted to build on the success of the inaugural Beer Hop, which had around 650 participants back in April, sampling craft beers, wines and other local produce.</p>
      <p>Councillors approved a council recommendation to give cash injection of $25,000 for the 2020 event, which organisers hope will allow more effective marketing and higher numbers to attend over the Easter weekend, which is traditionally a quiet time in the city and difficult for hospitality businesses.</p>

      <p>While Crs Hudson and Harris voted against the latter two grants, expressing concerns they were propping up private enterprises, they were in the minority and the grants were approved.</p>
