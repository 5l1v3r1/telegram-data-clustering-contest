      <h1>Vice President breaks ground for construction of Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu road</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:52:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:52</time> by <a rel="author">Edward Williams, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Jasikan (O/R), Nov. 19, GNA - The Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, on Tuesday broke grounds for the construction of the 56.4 kilometer- Lot 10 Jasikan to Dodo Pepesu stretch of the Eastern Corridor road.</p>
      <p>The groundbreaking ceremony took place in Jasikan in the Oti Region for the Government of Ghana project under the implementation and consultation of the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA).</p>
      <p>It will be constructed by the Sinohydro Corporation Limited at forty-five million US dollars (US$45,000,000).</p>
      <p>It is expected to be completed within a-30 calendar month period with funding from the Ghana/Sinohydro Master Project Support Agreement (Construction of Priority Infrastructure Projects).</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia in an address said government would work on other roads in the country.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the omission of roads in the Volta Region from the budget, the Vice President said roads such as the Ho dual carriageway, upgrading of Klefe town roads, upgrading of Kpando Municipality roads were all captured.</p>
      <p>He said government would make sure development reached every citizen in the country through government's flagship programmes and called for support from all.</p>
      <p>Nana Aburam Akpandja V, Paramount Chief of Buem Traditional Council, said the plight of almost every community in the country was the poor nature of roads and the need for them to be fixed.</p>
      <p>He expressed gratitude to government for taking the Jasikan to Dodo Pepesu road into consideration and prayed work on the project was done on schedule.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwasi Owusu-Yeboah, Oti Regional Minister, said government's swift response to the plight of the people in the Oti Region was admirable.</p>
      <p>He said some roads in the Region including the Dambai town roads, Nkonya-Wuropong roads and Jasikan-Worawora roads had also been captured in the Oti Region to be worked on.</p>
      <p>Mr Zhang Nianmu, President of Powerchina West and Central Africa, said work would immediately begin after the groundbreaking ceremony.</p>
      <p>He said work on the project would be given the needed importance and pledged the construction firm's respect for local authorities and their concerns.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwasi Amoako Atta, Minister for Roads and Highways, said several sections of the Eastern Corridor road including Asikuma-Kpeve were under construction as well as the Jasikan to Dodo Pepesu, which would be worked on to an asphaltic level.</p>
      <p>He added that all contractors working on all roads in the country would resume work at the end of November 2019.</p>
      <p>The Road Minister said the Ghana Highway Authority would properly supervise construction of the roads to ensure that Ghanaians had value for money and added that government would no longer work with ineffective contractors.</p>
      <p>Mr Amoako Atta asked individuals whose properties may be affected during the construction to cooperate with government for their compensations and called on motorists to adhere to constructional signs when work started.</p>
      <p>The completed project will have a 12.3m wide carriageway, which is two lanes, 3.65m width plus 2.5m wide shoulder on each side.</p>
      <p>There will also be provision and installation of road safety features such as road sign posts, crushed barriers, pedestrian guardrails, road markings and street lighting.</p>
      <p>The completion of Jasikan to Dodo Pepesu section will facilitate easier movement of farm produce and people from the food basket areas of the northern part of the Oti and Volta Regions.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some residents, especially traders and drivers in Jasikan, in the Oti Region have expressed high hopes ahead of the commencement of work on the stretch.</p>
      <p>Mr Edward Apreku, Jasikan Ghana Private Road Transport Union Station Master, said the only problem that was worrying drivers was the poor nature of the road.</p>
      <p>He said the poor state of the road had led to the increase in fares and the use of long routes to avoid unmotorable short routes, adding that the Union was likely to reduce fares once the road was constructed.</p>
      <p>Mr Apreku called on government to put in measures to ensure that the contractor remained on the road after the official breaking of grounds.</p>
      <p>Mr Ayuba Issaka, a driver on the Jasikan to Kadjebi road, said the poor nature of the road had increased the cost of maintenance.Â </p>
      <p>Madam Fati Zakari, a trader at a bus stop on the road, said most drivers had diverted routes due to the poor nature of the road and this had affected their businesses and also lamented the difficulty in getting their goods transported.</p>
      <p>She said the construction of the road would enable her and other traders to get their goods patronized since passengers and drivers would come back on the road.</p>
