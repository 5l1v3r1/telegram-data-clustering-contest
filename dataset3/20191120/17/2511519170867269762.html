      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> insists it is the “quality” in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>’s players that attracted him to accept the offer to replace <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> as manager.</p>
      <p>Daniel Levy has moved quickly to replace the Argentinian, with Spurs languishing in 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho has admitted he jumped at the chance to join a club with “such a great heritage”, particularly due to the talent available in the first team and the academy.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese explained: “I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, announcing Mourinho’s arrival, said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>“He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached.</p>
      <p>“We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
