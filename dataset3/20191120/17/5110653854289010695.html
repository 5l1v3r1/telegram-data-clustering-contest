      <h1>Le'Veon Bell upset with NFL for excessive drug tests with 'dirty ass needles'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:16:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>Le'Veon Bell is upset with the NFL, and it may land him in some trouble.</p>
      <p>The Jets running back expressed frustration Wednesday after claimingthe league has randomly drug tested him five times in the past 10 weeks. Bell said he's not going to cooperate if he gets tested again.</p>

      <p>Bell responded to a few other people who tweeted at him, staying strong in his stance that he won't participate in another test. One user told him the NFL "is petty" and will test him a sixth time just because of Bell's tweet. The running back responded, "and I won't be doin it."</p>
      <p>He also pushed back on the notion that he was being tested for drugs like marijuana. He's had previous issues with the league's substance abuse policy, serving a two-game suspension in 2015 and a three-game suspension in 2016.</p>

      <p>While Bell's anger is understandable, it could also result in serious consequences. He's unlikely to face punishment for the tweet itself, but him saying, "I’m not doing another after today" could be an issue in the future.</p>
      <p>A copy of the NFL and NFLPA's <a href="https://nflpaweb.blob.core.windows.net/media/Default/PDFs/2018%20Policy%20on%20Performance-Enhancing%20Substances.pdf">agreement</a> of the policy for performance-enhancing drugs clearly states that players unwilling to participate are subject to discipline. The policy states, "Players who fail to [appear for testing]without a valid reason as determined by the Independent Administrator will be subject to discipline."</p>
      <p>Thatdiscipline includes, according to the policy:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>First-time offense:</b> Fine up to $25,000</li>
        <li><b>Second-time offense:</b> Fine of two week's pay</li>
        <li><b>Third-time offense:</b> Four-game suspension without pay</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Of course, Bell will need to be tested again at some point this season before we worry about any of that.</p>
