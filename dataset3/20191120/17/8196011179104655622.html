      <p>The current model of funding for the health service is “destined to fail” each year, trade union SIPTU has told the Oireachtas health committee.</p>
      <p>The union's health division organiser, Paul Bell, said the current model leaves line managers struggling to provide for ever-expanding service needs.</p>
      <p>The union accepted that oversight and scrutiny are needed but the final approved funding plan generally looks nothing like the original one submitted at department level.</p>
      <p>Mr Bell said line managers and staff are left “totally demoralised” by the extensive efforts and repeated procedures required to fill vacancies for essential posts.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that over €200m will be spent this year on agency staff in the health service and includes €60m that will be spent on health care assistants and €50m on nurses and midwives.</p>
      <p>He said:</p>
      <blockquote>The reality is many agency workers are employed in the same hospital or ward for years rather than the HSE deciding to recruit.</blockquote>
      <p>"Agency work may have a place in our health service for short-term immediate or unexpected replacement. It cannot, however, be used as a replacement for direct employment for the filling of vital front-line health workers.”</p>
      <p>SIPTU sector organiser, Kevin Figgis, said an independent review of the radiology department at University Hospital Kerry found that it only has 60% of the required staffing</p>
      <p>Mr Figgis said the HSE and the hospital group accepted the report and all of its recommendations almost a year and a half ago but had no plan to fill all of the vacancies that they accepted were there. The department is still 30% short of the staffing needed.</p>
      <p>"That's just one example of most departments in most hospitals throughout the country," he said.</p>
