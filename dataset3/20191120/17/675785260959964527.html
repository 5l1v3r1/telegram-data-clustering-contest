      <p>A woman was shot dead in the street - after she asked her killer for 20p.</p>
      <p>Horrifying footage broadcast on Brazilian TV shows the beggar being gunned down in Niteroi, which is part of the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area.</p>
      <p>The gunman is seen whipping out his pistol and firing at his victim from close range before walking calmly from the scene as if nothing had happened.</p>
      <p>Police said after arresting the alleged killer, named locally as Aderbal Ramos de Castro, that the woman had been asking for one Brazilian real, the equivalent of just 18 pence.</p>
      <p>She has been identified as 31-year-old Zilda Henrique dos Santos Leandro, although she was better known by her nickname of Neia by other homeless people she lived on the streets with.</p>

      <p>The incident happened in the early hours of Saturday.</p>
      <p>The footage of the assassination was broadcast by RedeTV, which to spare viewers the full horror of the killing stopped the CCTV video when the killer pulled his trigger and blurred out the image of the victim on the ground once it restarted.</p>
      <p>A Good Samaritan can be seen running up to Neia moments after she was gunned down and trying to flag down a car for help which failed to stop.</p>
      <p>She was pronounced dead after being taken to a local hospital. She is thought to have been shot at least twice.</p>

      <p>The alleged killer was filmed looking back a couple of times as he walked down the street but at no time did he appear to break into a run after putting his weapon away to flee the scene as quickly as he could.</p>
      <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain, signed a decree in May enabling a wide number of people including truckers and politicians to carry weapons without having to prove why they needed them.</p>
      <p>It was later watered down by lawmakers, who voted only in favour of giving a limited number of people including hunters and not millions of ordinary Brazilians to buy and carry guns on the street.</p>
      <p>The new version of the bill has to approved by Brazil’s Upper House before it becomes law.</p>
      <p>Brazil already has one of the highest murder rates in the world.</p>
      <p>Official data shows a fall this year in the number of violent deaths. In the eight-month period to the end of August this year there were 27,517 violent deaths - 7,900 less than in January to August 2018 - according to the oficial figures.</p>
