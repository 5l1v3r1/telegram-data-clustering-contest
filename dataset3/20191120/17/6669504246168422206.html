      <p>TARRAGONA, Spain - Canadian golfer Aaron Cockerill has earned a European Tour playing card for the 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>The native of Stony Mountain, Man., finished Wednesday's sixth and final round tied for fifth at the tour's final qualifying tournament, putting him well inside the top-25 cutoff for a full card.</p>
      <p>"I'm just excited," Cockerill said. "I thought I'd probably be a little bit more emotional. I'm happy it's done with. It's a stressful week, especially when it's as close as it is."</p>
      <p>Cockerill, 27, was 16 under for the tournament, nine strokes behind winner Benjamin Poke of Denmark.</p>
      <p>Cockerill played on the Challenge Tour, the top feeder to the European Tour, this year. He finished 49th in the standings.</p>
      <p>The Canadian also played three events on the European Tour this season, making the cut in two.</p>
      <p>"I think my game will transfer maybe even better to more difficult golf courses," Cockerill said.</p>
      <p>Cockerill made the trek overseas after spending the past three years on the Mackenzie Tour-PGA Tour Canada following a four-year NCAA run at the University of Idaho.</p>
      <p>The European Tour often is called the second best tour in the world, behind the PGA Tour.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, few Canadians play the European Tour.</p>
      <p>The most recent winner of a European Tour event not affiliated with the PGA Tour was Jerry Anderson at the 1984 European Masters Swiss Open.</p>
      <p>Mike Weir won the 2000 WGC-American Express Championship and 2003 Masters, which were included on the European Tour schedule but also had many PGA Tour players.</p>
      <p>Cockerill is planning to return home to Manitoba on Thursday before returning overseas.</p>
      <p>"(His phone) hasn't stopped buzzing," Cockerill said. "I'm excited to talk everyone back home and just looking forward to next year."</p>
      <p>The 2019-20 season begins Nov. 28-Dec. 1 with the Alfred Dunhill Championship in South Africa.</p>
      <p>The schedule includes a minimum 46 events in 29 countries.</p>
