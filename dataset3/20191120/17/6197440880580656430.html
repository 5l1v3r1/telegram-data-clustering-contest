      <h1>Samsung Music supports Android 10 and Android Auto w/ latest update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:40:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Samsung has just given its official music app a couple of big upgrades. With the latest Samsung Music update, both Android 10 and Android Auto are supported.</p>
      <p>Noted by the folks at <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-music-app-updated-with-android-10-android-auto-support/"><i>SamMobile</i></a>, the latest update to Samsung Music delivers support for Android 10. This makes sense, of course, since Samsung is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/25/note-10-android-10-beta/">actively beta testing that update</a> on Galaxy S10, Note 10, and even S9/Note 9 models. It’s only a matter of time until the update hits all users and the Music app will need to be working by then.</p>
      <p>More importantly, though, this update also finally delivers Android Auto support in Samsung Music. Once you open Android Auto the app shows as an option both on the in-car display and the Android Auto for Phone Screens app. In either case, you’ll get a relatively bare-bones interface that’s still well-optimized for driving.</p>
      <p>The interface for Samsung Music in Android Auto also has an expandable menu which includes buttons for the queue, shuffle, and repeat. There’s also a way to see songs you’ve stored on your device.</p>
      <p>Android 10 and Android Auto support are both live in Samsung Music v16.2.20.19 which is rolling out now on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.music&amp;hl=en_IN">Google Play Store</a> and the <a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.sec.android.app.music?session_id=W_30f372c1a13c699cc7d02e963eb5f2ab">Galaxy Store</a>.</p>
