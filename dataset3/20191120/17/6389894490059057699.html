      <h1>TfL deficit shrinks thanks to Ulez and increased Tube numbers</h1>

      <p>Transport for London’s (TfL) first half revenues beat budget expectations by £260m, but the body still recorded a nine-figure deficit for the period.</p>
      <p>TfL’s second quarter results, released today, revealed a £111m operating loss for the first half of 2019-20 – an 80 per cent increase compared to the same period in 2018-19.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The figures drastically beat expectations as TfL had budgeted for a £372m deficit for the period.</p>
      <p>The better-than-expected performance was put down to an increase in passenger numbers on the London Underground and a less than expected decline in bus journeys.</p>
      <p>TfL had budgeted for zero Tube passenger growth on the back of economic and Brexit uncertainty.</p>
      <p>Operating income also soared thanks to an £80m injection of revenues from Ultra Low Emission Zone (Ulez) charges.</p>
      <p>A TfL spokesperson said they aimed to be back in the black by 2022-23.</p>
      <p>“We remain on track to reduce our overall net operating deficit across this financial year, as we work towards achieving an operating surplus by 2022/23, as outlined in our Business Plan last December,” they said.</p>
      <p>City Hall has attracted great criticism for refusing to raise ticket prices as yearly losses have crept close to £1bn last year.</p>
      <p>His four-year fares freeze has come alongside a £700m reduction in government funding and mounting losses on bus journeys.</p>
      <p>TfL’s debt has now reached £11bn and is expected to climb to £13bn by 2022-23, according to a London Assembly investigation last year.</p>
      <p>Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey said earlier this year he would raise TfL fares and independent candidate Rory Stewart said it was something he was considering.</p>
      <p>“The amount of debt TfL has incurred is staggering,” Bailey said today.</p>
      <p>“The answer can’t be to push the mess into the future, as Mr. Khan proposes to do.”</p>

      <p>A Khan spokesperson defended the mayor’s fare freeze as “making transport more affordable for millions of Londoners”.</p>
      <p>“When he was Tory Mayor, Boris Johnson increased TfL fares by 42 per cent,” they said.</p>
