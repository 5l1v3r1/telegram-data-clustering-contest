      <h2>The taxi aggregator keen on opening back-end facility in the city</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:35:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Santosh-Patnaik-849/" target="_blank">Santosh Patnaik</a></address>
      <p>Taxi aggregator Uber may open a huge campus in Visakhapatnam with a 1,000-seater capacity. At present, Uber has outsourced its activity to a prominent BPO location in the city. The firm has showed interest in acquiring a suitable land for the purpose. Stating that the proposal is at nascent stage, Software Technology Parks of India joint director M.P. Dubey has told <i>The Hindu </i>that going by the ecosystem created in the city, Uber has evinced keen interest in opening its back-end facility due to availability of a large number of young graduates and affordable social infrastructure. It is not yet known about the size of their investment. Sources say the officials of Uber, which provides rides in various cities and towns across the country, are in touch with the authorities of State and Central governments.</p>
      <h3>IT turnover</h3>
      <p>The city has an IT and ITES turnover to the tune of ₹2,000 crore, a lion’s share of which comes from BPO units.</p>
      <p>IT Association of Andhra Pradesh is confident that the city will see a quantum jump in volume of business in the years to come.</p>
      <p>Welcoming the proposal by Uber for establishing a back-end facility to meet its requirement, Federal Bank opened FedServ, wholly-owned subsidiary of the bank in the city sometime ago, Rushikonda IT Association vice-president O. Naresh Kumar say they will roll out a red carpet to investments that will give a fillip to promotion of ‘Brand Vizag.’</p>
      <p>While some of the fintech companies either folded up or scaled down their operations during the past few months, Franklin Templeton, leading American asset management firm, resolved to go ahead with its plan to set up a huge campus here following the intervention of Industries and IT Minister Mekapati Gowtham Reddy immediately after the formation of the new government in the State.</p>
