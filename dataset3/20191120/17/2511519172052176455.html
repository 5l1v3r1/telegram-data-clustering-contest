      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> has been appointed as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>’s new manager after the club sensationally sacked <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been dismissed after five-and-a-half years in north London – and just six months after he steered the club to the final of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>However, Pochettino has endured a miserable start to the new season, with a number of first-team players growing disillusioned with his managerial style.</p>
      <p>Last week Pochettino reportedly turned down a request from chairman <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Daniel_Levy">Daniel Levy</a> to step down from his post, leading to his sacking this week.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Mourinho has now signed a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season. But who are the winners and losers in the dressing room following his controversial appointment?</p>

      </p>
      <p>Tottenham chairman Levy, announcing Mourinho’s arrival, said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>“He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached.</p>
      <p>“We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho said: “I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>A Spurs statement read: “Jose is one of the world’s most accomplished managers having won 25 senior trophies.</p>
      <p>“He is renowned for his tactical prowess and has managed FC Porto, Inter Milan, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United.</p>
      <p>“He has won a domestic title in a record four different countries (Portugal, England, Italy and Spain) and is one of only three managers to have won the UEFA Champions League twice with two clubs, FC Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010.</p>
      <p>“He is also a three-time <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/PremierLeague">Premier League</a> Champion with Chelsea (2005, 2006, 2015).”</p>
