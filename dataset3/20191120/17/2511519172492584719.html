      <h1>Where next for Mauricio Pochettino? Tottenham’s former star forced to start again with the shine off</h1>
      <h2>A progressive thinker who cut his teeth at his beloved Espanyol, broadened his horizons at Southampton and then showed his class at Tottenham should be top on the list of any big club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:02:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:02</time> by <a rel="author">Vithushan Ehantharajah</a></address>
      <p>Tears of joy streaming down his face as he sunk to his knees, fists pounding the Amsterdam Arena turf, designer watch falling off his wrist in the process. </p>
      <p>Here, ultimately, was <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s highest point as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager. A thrilling semi-final win – an against the odds flip, from 2-0 to 2-3 against Ajax – to send Spurs to their first-ever Champions League final.</p>
      <p>There were no trophies to speak of and one could argue losing the final to Liverpool, his most important game in charge, set him on the demoralising path that leads, here, to his sacking 12 games into the season with Spurs languishing in 14th. </p>
      <p>Yet even in modern football’s “show us your medals” world, Pochettino’s five-and-a-bit seasons in North London has seen him emerge as one of the most progressive managers in the game. Since joining Spurs in 2014, he pushed a club in disarray to top-four finishes in four of five seasons, achieving a high of second in 2016/17. </p>
      <p>He did so by being clear with his vision, backing youngsters, managing his more established talent and managing to convince all of them to run like hell from start to finish. And while it has been easy to poke holes in his methods as results began to wane, Spurs punched above their weight and, for the most part, looked comfortable doing it. All on a lower budget to their rivals. </p>
      <p>Ultimately, he proved Daniel Levy right when, upon sealing his signature from Southampton, he effused that the Argentine had “a proven ability to develop each player as an individual while building great team spirit and a winning mentality”. Now the Spurs chairman has ended his time at the club, where to next for the 47-year old? </p>
      <p>Real Madrid and Manchester United were continually linked with Pochettino last season and that talk has not cooled in the last few months. But even with Real’s fitful start to the season under Zinedine Zidane, it is understood the 13-time European Cup winners have been put off slightly by reports of how Pochettino deals with older players. </p>
      <p>When United sacked Jose Mourinho in December 2018, Pochettino was top of their list as the permanent successor. Those at the club felt he could be swayed with a greater budget sensing he was frustrated by the financial restrictions at Spurs both in terms of the wages and money to spend in the transfer market. Instead, they opted to make Ole Gunnar Solksjaer’s temporary role permanent. Results under the Norwegian since have been underwhelming. </p>
      <p>Though there has been a slight upturn, albeit, in a period of favourable fixtures, United are seventh, with four wins, four draws and four losses. And while Solskjaer has been promised time, the looming presence of a free and available Pochettino – it would have reportedly cost £30m to prise him out of a contract that had four years left to run before Tuesday night’s developments – will cast a shadow over every misstep from now on.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Pochettino’s immediate availability might cause those trigger fingers to itch that little bit more at Old Trafford and the Bernabeu. So, too, will the vacancy at Bayern Munich, the German champions having parted company with Niko Kovac a couple of weeks ago. </p>
      <p>It might seem odd for Bayern to turn to a manager who was in charge of the side they thrashed 7-2 at the beginning of October, but they themselves are in a bad way, four points off the top of the Bundesliga, in third, and struggling for their identity. Their football has become sluggish and too reactive for chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge's liking. More zest and more energy, as is Pochettino's way, would be welcome. </p>
      <p>Thomas Tuchel may also be looking over his shoulder. The Paris Saint-Germain boss was given time despite a tricky end to last season and has responded with a strong showing in the opening four matches of the Champions League, with 12 points seeing them lead a group containing Real Madrid. </p>
      <p>But indifferent league form, even though they are eight points clear, has meant doubts about his position from the powerbrokers in the French capital still remain. Pochettino, who was on PSG's shortlist before they opted for Tuchel, spent two years at the club as a player between 2001 and 2003, making 70 appearances in all competitions. </p>
      <p>Of course, the manner in which things have ended at Spurs will have some wondering if they need to be wary of Pochettino's manner. His tactical decisions lacked the usual clarity, his motivational methods suddenly felt affected and stale. And his mood swings, both publicly and privately, suggested a fiery character that could eventually be tough to assuage. </p>
      <p>But judging him on the last eight months at a club he had taken as far as he could would be misguided. A progressive thinker who cut his teeth at his beloved Espanyol, broadened his horizons at Southampton and then showed his class at Tottenham should be top on the list of any big club looking for a modern, exciting manager deserving of a place at the top table. </p>
      <p>Now it is just a case of who will get him first. </p>
