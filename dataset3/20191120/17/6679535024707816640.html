      <p>The CBI on Wednesday filed a supplementary charge sheet against accused Sanjeev Punalekar and Vikram Bhave in the 2013 murder case of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar.</p>
      <p>While Mr. Bhave is in Yerawada jail here under judicial custody, Mr. Punalekar, a lawyer, is out on bail.</p>
      <p>The CBI, through its special public prosecutor Prakash Suryawanshi, filed the supplementary charge sheet in the court of assistant sessions judge S.R. Navandar, presiding over a special court set up under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).</p>
      <p>Till now, charge sheet has been filed against five accused in the high-profile murder case suspected to be handiwork of right-wing activists.</p>
      <p>Mr. Punalekar and his assistant Mr. Bhave were arrested by the CBI on May 25. In July, Punalekar was released on bail.</p>
      <p>Mr. Punalekar is accused of advising Sharad Kalaskar, one of the two alleged motorcycle-borne assailants who gunned down Dabholkar here on August 20, 2013, to destroy the weapons used in the crime.</p>
      <p>According to the CBI, Mr. Bhave helped the two alleged shooters - Sachin Andure and Mr. Kalaskar - in conducting a survey of the spot where the well-known anti-superstition activist was shot dead while on a morning walk on the Onkareshwar Bridge here.</p>
      <p>Mr. Bhave is also accused of helping the gunmen escape from the murder spot and assisting them to abandon the motorcycle used in the crime.</p>
