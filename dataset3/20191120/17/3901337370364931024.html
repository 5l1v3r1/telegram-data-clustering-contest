      <h1>Downs Provide Zwane &amp; Sirino Update</h1>

      <p>Gaston Sirino could be fit to boost the Mamelodi Sundowns attack for their away Telkom Knockout semi-final clash against Golden Arrows, assistant coach Manqoba Mnqgithi has said, though he ruled out Themba Zwane.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The duo have been missing through injury, with Sirino sitting out the club’s two previous games and Zwane declared unavailable in the previous four.</p>
      <p>Zwane also had to be withdrawn from the Bafana Bafana squad that faced Ghana and Sudan in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers this month. </p>
      <p>“We have really missed them, a lot. They are very important to our team, ‘Mshishi’ (Zwane) in particular, really dictates the tempo of the game and gives that sense of dominance when opponents are coming at us. That is why we have him because we know he is important. He is still not going to make it for this match,” Mnqgithi said on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>“But Gaston is back. He is in full training and he has done very well and we believe he will be able to make the squad for the match. We have been unfortunate, but putting excuses does not help. We have lost a lot of offensive players that were looking to have a big influence in our game like Phakamani Mahlambi and Keletso Makgalwa – the players we thought would use their speed and precision to help us.”</p>
