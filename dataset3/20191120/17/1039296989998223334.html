      <p>Mahindra Thar-based Roxor SUV gets a new front-end design and more features. We bring you first image.</p>
      <p>Mahindra is all set to announce an updated Roxor SUV in the coming days. For those who don’t know, the Roxor is a Thar-based off-road vehicle sold in the North American market. The SUV is built by Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA), which is Mahindra &amp; Mahindra's subsidiary in the US. </p>
      <p>As part of the 2020 updates, the Roxor gets an all-new front styling that replaces its retro looks with a more modern design – it gets a honeycomb grille and a plastic border around the headlamps. The new look co-incidentally seems to be inspired by the 1970s Land Cruiser FJ series.  The company had shown multiple concepts based on the Roxor at the recently concluded SEMA show in Las Vegas, USA. </p>
      <p>Additionally, the updated Roxor also gets a 5:38 axle ratio that, according to Mahindra, helps it climb hills better and makes the engine peppier. Speaking of the engine, the Roxor continues to be powered by the same 2.5-litre diesel engine that’s present on the 2019 model; it is mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 6-speed torque convertor automatic gearbox.</p>
      <p>The Roxor gets a long list of customisation options straight from the factory, and there are many aftermarket tuning companies offering power and off-road related upgrades as well. The Roxor has been an instant hit amongst the North American off-road community, and the company is currently rolling out as many as 30 units of the SUV every day from its Michigan plant. Additionally, Mahindra will also supply the vehicle to the US Federal Postal Service. The Roxor 2020 is priced at USD 16,599 (ex-showroom) and is expected to hit Mahindra’s North American outlets soon.</p>
      <p>Closer to home, Mahindra is in the process of putting final touches to the second-gen Thar SUV, which is expected to see a world premier in the coming months.</p>
