      </p>
      <p>With all the discussion over whether or not there should be billionaires in our society, I confess to finding myself rather unconcerned that jewellery worth over £1m has been stolen from a £6m mansion in north London (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/19/burglars-jewellery-london-home-brazen-heist">Report</a>, 19 November).</p>
      <p>This is one of the consequences of huge and visible inequality – those with so much less deeply resent the gap and decide to take redistribution into their own hands. his has led to gated communities for the rich, who sit in fear inside, while the poor lurk outside pressing their noses against the glass. Not a happy life for either side.</p>
      <p>The fact that some members of the family, including children, were at home when the intruders broke in is by far the worst aspect of the crime and one can feel great sympathy for the mother involved. But when so many people are struggling to feed their families, why should we care that a wealthy family has just lost one of its millions?<br/><b>Cherry Weston</b><br/><i>Wolverhampton</i></p>
