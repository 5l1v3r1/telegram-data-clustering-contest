      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> is reportedly considering doing another television interview – after his last backfired spectacularly.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York appeared on Newsnight last weekend in a performance dubbed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">‘nuclear explosion level bad’</a> that provoked days of criticism and further allegations.</p>
      <p>BBC presenter Emily Maitlis asked the Duke if he had had sex with Virginia Giuffre (then Roberts), who was 17 at the time, and about his links to disgraced billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old denied the allegation – suggesting he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">unable to sweat</a> and that he had been in a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">Pizza Express in Woking</a> when it took place. He also failed to express sympathy for the victims of Epstein, who he described as ‘unbecoming’.</p>
      <p>Now, a Royal source says they have heard that the Queen’s second son could be considering another appearance on television to ‘put right’ the previous interview, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_brand=vanity-fair&amp;utm_social-type=earned#">according to Vanity Fair.</a></p>

      <p>The magazine reported that the source said: ‘Andrew hasn’t drawn a line under it.</p>

      <p>‘He wants the chance to put right the things he didn’t say.’</p>
      <p>They continued: ‘Newsnight gave him the chance to show some remorse.</p>
      <p>‘He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say.</p>
      <p>‘It was an open goal—he didn’t grasp it, and I think he sees that now.’</p>

      <p>However, Vanity Fair reported that Buckingham Palace said it is ‘not aware’ of anything in the pipeline.</p>
      <p>When asked by Metro.co.uk if Andrew might be lining up another interview, a Palace spokeswoman declined to comment, labelling the report ‘speculation’.</p>
      <p>Following the BBC interview, a series of further allegations have deepened the crisis around the Duke.</p>

      <p>The Palace have been forced to deny he used racist language while meeting a Downing Street aide, while a number of experts have expressed doubts about what he said during the interview.</p>
      <p>Various organisations have also cut ties with the Duke.</p>
