      <p>Former independent counsel and Fox News contributor Ken Starr argued that EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland’s public testimony Wednesday was a “bombshell” day.</p>
      <p>During an interview on Fox News during a break in the hearing, Starr reacted to Sondland’s testimony by saying that the news “doesn’t look good” for President Trump. Sondland testified that he was pursuing Trump’s priorities when he pushed Ukraine for a public commitment to pursue the politicized investigations Trump wanted.</p>
      <p>Starr also said that Sondland’s testimony brought the Ukraine pressure campaign “closer to the President” and that “it doesn’t look good for the President substantively.”</p>
      <p>Starr then mentioned that House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA) discussed the impeachment of former President Richard Nixon.</p>
      <p>“We already have one article of impeachment and the third article of impeachment in the Richard Nixon situation is very clear, it’s very succinct, it’s very well done,” Starr said.</p>
      <p>Starr added that “there will be articles of impeachment” and that Sondland’s testimony “has been one of those bombshell days.”</p>
      <p>“I think we’ve known that. It was just confirmed today and then, substantively, what we heard from [Schiff] just now is: It’s over. We now know — this is his position — we now know that the President in fact committed the crime of bribery,” Starr said. “Something of value. That’s litigable, but I think articles of impeachment are being drawn up if they haven’t already been drawn up. So it depends, will it be bipartisan and so forth. So this obviously has been one of those bombshell days.”</p>
