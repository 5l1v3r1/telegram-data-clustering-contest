      <p>“If we do not stay hydrated, our physical performance will suffer. All systems of the body work better in a water-rich environment. Drink water steadily throughout the day to avoid dehydration,” Collector A. Md. Imtiaz told the students of Zilla Parishad High School at Patamata on Wednesday. Addressing the students on the sidelines of ‘water bell’ initiative which aims at encouraging students to drink plenty of water during the day to stay hydrated and fit, the Collector said the initiative was being introduced in 4,530 schools across Krishna district -- 3180 government schools and 1350 private schools. He said although children bring water bottles, they forget to drink when they get busy in their lessons. Under this programme, there would be a special bell in every two hours, in primary schools at 9.30 a.m., 11.15 am and 2 p.m and for high schools at 10.5 a.m, 12.30 noon, 2.30 p.m and 4.10 p.m. Teachers should ensure that this small break is utilised by all students to drink water.</p>
      <p>The Collector distributed small hand-stitched bags to the District Education Officer Rajya Lakshmi, Deputy DEO Chandrakala, school headmistress U. Vijayalakshmi, tahsildar Lalitanjali.</p>
      <p>The Collector said the bags were stitched with the shawls he had received from people who felicitated him.</p>
      <h3>Child rights</h3>
      <p>In a separate programme at Zilla Parishad Boys School at Patamata, the Collector said every individual should strive to protect child rights.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a meeting organised by Childline as part of the International Child Rights Week, he released a poster. Childline coordinator Arava Ramesh and officials of the Education Department were present.</p>
