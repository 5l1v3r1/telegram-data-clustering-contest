      <h1>Second New Yorker dead from vaping-related illness: officials</h1>

      <p>A second New Yorker has died from a vaping-related injury, officials announced Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The man — who was in his 30s and had a “history of using e-cigarettes and vape products” — died on Nov. 9 in Manhattan at Bellevue Hospital, according to a source and Gov. Andrew Cuomo.</p>
      <p>“Based on an investigation and medical record review, DOH has determined the death to be vaping related,” Cuomo said in a statement. “DOH is continuing its robust investigation into the cause of these illnesses, but in the meantime, our message on vaping remains unchanged: if you don’t know what you’re smoking, don’t smoke it.”</p>
      <p>The Manhattan man was transferred to Bellevue after doctors at his first hospital couldn’t treat him, sources told The Post.</p>
      <p>Doctors found a mix of nicotine and marijuana in his system, the source said.</p>
      <p>The first New Yorker <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/08/bronx-teen-confirmed-as-first-new-yorker-to-die-of-vaping-related-illness/">to die from vaping</a> was a Bronx teenager, who passed away at Montefiore Medical Center’s Children’s Hospital in October. The teen died from vaping marijuana, sources told The Post at the time.</p>
      <p>At an unrelated press conference Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio called the death a “tragic reality” and said officials must “throw the book at the vaping industry.”</p>
      <p>New York State’s Health Department has repeatedly said black market marijuana vaping <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/15/inside-the-deadly-vaping-crisis-thats-gripping-the-nation/">are tightly linked to the crisis</a>, which has claimed at least 42 lives and injured over 2,000 others across the country.</p>
      <p>Early on, New York officials were the first <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/06/vitamin-e-acetate-could-be-causing-vape-related-illnesses-officials/">to name vitamin E acetate</a> as the compound likely behind the mystery illnesses, saying in early September the substance was in “nearly every” marijuana vape product they tested.</p>
      <p>Federal health officials confirmed the finding in November, labeling the compound a “chemical of concern” after discovering it in lung fluid samples from 29 patients diagnosed with EVALI, or e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury.</p>
      <p>However, the CDC also found that nicotine products <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/federal-officials-identify-chemical-of-concern-linked-to-39-vaping-deaths/">can pose a risk</a>, contradicting earlier reports that pinned the crisis solely on black market marijuana vapes.</p>
      <p>At least five patients with vitamin E acetate found in their lungs only had nicotine in their system, the CDC determined. Officials there say it is too early to rule out the possibility that other chemicals contribute to the illnesses.</p>
      <p>Vitamin E acetate is a typically harmless substance used in cosmetics, foods and other ordinary items. It is considered safe applied topically or ingested but damages the respiratory system when inhaled.</p>
