      <h1>Fast and Furious fans fume over decision to revive late Paul Walker's character</h1>
      <h2>As the news was announced that Paul Walker's character would be brought back for the next Fast and furious film, fans blasted it as insensitive to his memory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:00:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p>Fans of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fast-furious">Fast and Furious</a> franchise are disgusted at the producers' decision to bring back <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/paul-walker">Paul Walker</a> 's character.</p>
      <p>The late actor played Brian O'Connor in the Fast and Furious movies until his death in 2013.</p>
      <p>He died in a car crash alongside his friend, and never completed filming for Furious 7.</p>
      <p>Instead, his character's final scenes were created with the help of CGI and his two brothers Cody and Caleb.</p>
      <p>The film ended with a touching tribute to Paul, and was seen as saying goodbye to him.</p>
      <p>Because of this, fans have slammed the decision to reanimate his character for the next film, believing he should be left to rest.</p>

      <p>"Not sure how I feel about it myself but we'll see.</p>
      <p>"It's been long enough. They are bringing back Paul Walker's character, Brian to FF9."</p>

      <p>Replies to the tweet included: "Completely undermining the ending of Fast 7 and Paul himself. Disgraceful."</p>
      <p>"I'm sorry that scene at end of Furious 7 was magical, this will taint it", said another.</p>
      <p>"No, Paul’s character Brian had a beautiful sendoff that doesn’t need to be used to gain more money from.</p>

      <p>"It gave us a sense of closure and finality to his and Jordana’s respective characters", added a third.</p>
      <p>"This is not only unnecessary but absolutely distasteful and disgraceful", said a fourth.</p>
      <p>His character's wife, Jordana Brewster, played by Mia Toretto, will also be returning in the next film.</p>
