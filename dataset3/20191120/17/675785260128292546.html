      <h1>Jose Mourinho aims dig at Man Utd and Chelsea during first interview as Tottenham manager</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho spoke for the first time after being appointed as Tottenham boss - and was sure to have a dig at ex- clubs Manchester United and Chelsea</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:32:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has appeared to take aim at Manchester United and Chelsea's youth structures, claiming that his former clubs didn't produce youngsters good enough for first-team football.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> boss signed a three-and-a-half-year contract with Spurs less than 12 hours after Mauricio Pochettino was sensationally sacked.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old had been out of work since leaving United last December but is now back in the Premier League and tasked with reviving Spurs' youthful squad.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has often <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/hypocritical-jose-mourinho-wrong-criticise-18949071">courted criticism throughout his managerial career</a> for failing to show faith in youth, but he is now relishing the chance to follow Pochettino's philisophy.</p>

      <p>And, in getting his point across, the Champions League-winning manager suggested that his other former clubs didn't allow him to blood youth.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Spurs TV, he said: "There is not one manager in the world that doesn't like to play young players and to help young players to develop - not one.</p>
      <p>"The problem is that sometimes you get into clubs where the work that is below you is not good enough to produce these players.</p>
      <p>"So I look to our history and you see that the academy is always giving talents the first team need. Of course I always look forward to working with that profile."</p>

      <p>Mourinho moved quickly to appoint his backroom staff, with Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos joining from Lille as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach, respectively.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> also confirmed the arrival of Carlos Lalin as fitness coach, Ricardo Formosinho as tactical analyst and Giovanni Cerra as technical analyst.</p>
      <p>All three worked under Mourinho at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Despite his troubles in the latter stages of his tenure at Old Trafford, Mourinho remains one of the most sought-after managers in the game.</p>
      <p>His success at delivering trophies is not in question, having won three Premier League titles, two Champions Leagues and a host of domestic cups, and that was a clear attraction for Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
