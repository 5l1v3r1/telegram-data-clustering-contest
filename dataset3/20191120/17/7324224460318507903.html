      <p>Noel Gallagher has said that he urged his brother Liam to continue using the name Oasis after he quit the band.</p>
      <p>The former bandmates have been locked in a war of words since their acrimonious split in 2009, prompted by a backstage brawl at the Rock en Seine festival in Paris.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, Liam reformed the ex-members of Oasis and renamed themselves Beady Eye, releasing two albums between 2011 and 2013.</p>

      <p>However, Noel said he had told Liam to continue with the name Oasis at the time.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1, he said: “I suggested (he keep the name), when we were all still part of the same management firm and all that.</p>
      <p>“And I was saying for the people: ‘What’s Beady Eye all about?’</p>
      <p>“It should just be him. You know. It should just be (Oasis)… and he should have done that when the band split up.</p>
      <p>“But for whatever reason, they decided they were going to start another band and all right, fair enough.”</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old recently said that every tweet from Liam was a “nail in the coffin” of Oasis reunion hopes.</p>

      <p>The rocker also told Lowe that he was the “real deal” when it came to climate change because he does not drive a car.</p>
      <p>He said: “Well, I don’t drive, so I’m part of the solution (for climate change).</p>
      <p>“I still don’t drive. I take public transport, obviously not when I’m here, but when I’m in London, I’m always on the Tube and the trains. So I’m part of the solution.</p>
      <p>“So when I’m f****** giving it to a load of snowflakes about climate change, I’m like, I’m the f****** real deal here because I know.”</p>
