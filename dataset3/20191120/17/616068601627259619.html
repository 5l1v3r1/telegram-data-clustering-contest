      <p>Streets in downtown Victoria were closed Tuesday for filming of Jordan Peele's The Twilight Zone television series.</p>
      <p>The remake of the popular 1960s sci-fi show shut down traffic in front of the Fairmont Empress Hotel, <a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/downtown-victoria-scene-of-filming-for-new-twilight-zone-series-1.4693200">CTV Vancouver Island</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Production for The Twilight Zone first came to the Island on Monday, as crews and work trucks began to prepare for filming. Wednesday, the crews continued to film in the Humboldt and Gordon street area throughout the day.</p>
      <p>The 2019 version of The Twilight Zone is described as "an updated version of the classic anthology series featuring various tales of science fiction, mystery, and horror," according to the show's IMDB page. </p>
      <p>The series was created by Academy Award-winner Jordan Peele, whose popularity skyrocketed after his directing debut of horror movie <i>Get Out</i>, followed by the popular <i>Us</i> and <i>BlacKkKlansman</i>.</p>
