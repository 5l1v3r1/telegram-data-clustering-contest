      <p>A British aristocrat was dumped Wednesday from turning on the Christmas lights in Prince Charles’ home town because of comments she made about Jeffrey Epstein and pedophilia on live TV.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/07/14/this-aristocrat-insists-queen-elizabeth-had-a-steamy-sex-life/">Royal biographer Lady Colin Campbell</a>, 70, sparked outrage on Monday by suggesting it was OK for Prince Andrew to have remained friends with Epstein because people were over-reacting about his sex crimes.</p>
      <p>“You all seem to have forgotten that Jeffrey Epstein, the offense with which he was charged and for which he was imprisoned, was soliciting prostitution from minors,” she said on “Good Morning Britain,” <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10368134/lady-colin-campbell-under-age-sex-paedophilia/">according to The Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>“That is not the same thing as pedophilia,” the one-time reality TV star said, insisting to those claims despite interviewer Piers Morgan pointing out Epstein is accused of sex with a 14-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>“There’s a difference between a minor and a child,” Lady Campbell said, sticking to her guns that Epstein was not a convicted pedophile.</p>
      <p>She had been due to switch on the lights next month in Tetbury, the Gloucestershire town that is home to Charles’ Highgrove House estate.</p>
      <p>But Tetbury Town Council on Wednesday <a href="http://tetbury.gov.uk/statement-from-the-organisers-of-the-christmas-lights-switch-on-event/">referred to the “recent controversy”</a> of her remarks in announcing she had been axed — with the town mayor and kids from a local school replacing her.</p>
