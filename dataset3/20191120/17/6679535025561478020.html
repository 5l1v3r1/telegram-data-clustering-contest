      <p>Chaos prevailed at the Trauma and Emergency Care Centre in Victoria Hospital on Wednesday afternoon when the Casualty Medical Officer (CMO) of the hospital allegedly harassed a woman official from the State Health Department, who was part of a team that had gone to assess the hospital for Kayakalp awards.</p>
      <p>These awards, instituted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, are given to promote cleanliness, hygiene, and infection-control practices in government hospitals.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, when the team of assessors visited the Trauma Care Centre, the CMO, Madhusudan Ramdas, allegedly obstructed the woman official and verbally harassed her in the boardroom in the presence of other doctors and staff.</p>
      <p>The woman, who was visibly upset, rushed out of the boardroom and complained to the Special Officer of the centre, S. Balaji Pai. Several women staff members at the hospital, including nurses, lab technicians, and group ‘D’ workers, also joined her in her complaint stating that they were also being harassed by Dr. Ramdas.</p>
      <p>Dr. Pai told <i>The Hindu</i> he had lodged a police complaint against the doctor following a written complaint by the women staff. “Inquiries have also been initiated. I have brought this to the notice of the Dean and Director of Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI). He has been troubling our staff members regularly for no reason, disturbing the decorum of the hospital. I will also meet the Chief Secretary tomorrow [Thursday] and bring this to his notice,” he said.</p>
      <p>BMCRI Dean and Director C.R. Jayanthi said, “A police complaint has been filed and we will investigate the matter. I am told the doctor has been regularly creating problems for other staff. We will look into it.”</p>
      <p>A senior police officer at V.V. Puram station said, “We received a complaint about an altercation between two doctors. Based on the complaint, we summoned them and took an undertaking from the doctor accused of harassment.” The verbal duel is because of administrative matters. The doctor was let off after a warning, and we have filed a non-cognizable report, the officer said.</p>
