      <h1>Divinity: Original Sin is a Board Game Now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:19:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>One of the best RPGs of the past few years could soon be coming to your tabletop. Earlier today, Larian Studios and Lynnvander Studios began a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/larianstudios/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game">Kickstarter campaign</a> for <i>Divinity Original Sin: The Board Game</i>.</p>
      <p>The game is a co-operative spin on <i>Divinity: Original Sin</i> for up to four players, boasting a branching narrative and tactical combat featuring characters from <i>D:OS II</i>. Developed by Canadian board game company Lynnvander Studios, the expansive project is expected to release in October 2020.</p>

      <p>The choices players make during each campaign will lead them towards one of multiple different endings, but Divinity Original Sin: The Board Game also employs the Chronicle System. Each copy of the game comes with a one-time code allowing players to submit the choices they made during their adventure to Lynnvander, who will collect the information and use it to shape the direction of future expansions.</p>
      <p>The Kickstarter campaign began earlier today, but has already racked up around two-thirds of its aim (more than £82,000 of its £124,000 ask), so it seems pretty likely it’ll make it over the line. Sure, it’s likely to set you back a substantial amount but, given how good <i>Original Sin II</i> was, I’m sure it’ll prove be worth it.</p>
