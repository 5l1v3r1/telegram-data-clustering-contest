      <h1>'Disgrace to all who have served': Conservative veterans decry Vindman after public impeachment testimony</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:07:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Dominick Mastrangelo</a></address>
      <p>Several high-profile, right-leaning veterans slammed <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/vindman-chose-to-wear-army-uniform-while-testifying-he-pulled-the-soldier-card-military-officer-says">Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman</a> after his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-intelligence-committee-holds-next-public-impeachment-hearing-featuring-vindman">public impeachment hearing</a>, including his decision to wear his official military uniform.</p>
      <p>Vindman, a decorated combat veteran working in the Trump administration, told the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday that he found Trump's <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-white-house-transcript-of-trumps-call-with-ukraines-president">July 25 phone cal</a>l with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "inappropriate," echoing a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-whistleblower-complaint-about-trump-here">whistleblower complaint</a> that alleged the president improperly pressured Ukraine into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/nicolle-wallace-calls-laura-ingraham-and-sean-duffy-chickenshit-for-questioning-vindmans-loyalty">conservative media pundits</a> have spent recent weeks discrediting Vindman, with some questioning the Ukrainian refugee's loyalty to the United States.</p>
      <p>"I wish the left wouldn’t use his uniform to make him a saint. He’s an operative with an agenda," said Robert J. O'Neill, the Navy Seal who claims to have killed Osama bin Laden, after Vindman's testimony. Army Regulation 670-1 <a href="https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/337951.pdf">says,</a> "when an invitation calls for business attire, the appropriate Army uniform is the service or dress uniform."</p>

      <p>"Vindman is a disgrace to all who have served," Mark Geist, a Marine who fought the Battle of Benghazi in 2012, further blasted Vindman. "Transcript of his previous closed door testimony he clearly admits to undermining the [presidents] foreign policy, and now he has chairman Schiff advising him on how to answer questions."</p>

      <p>During an exchange with Rep. Devin Nunes, Vindman <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-chides-nunes-its-lieutenant-colonel-vindman-please">asked the ranking member to address him</a> by his military rank when the California Republican referred to him as "Mr. Vindman," saying, "It's Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please."</p>
      <p>"Correcting a civilian about how to be a addressed is a for sure way to make everyone in the military think you are a douche bag," Tim Kennedy, an MMA fighter and former Special Forces fighter, commented on the moment.</p>

      <p>Democrats have condemned attacks on Vindman's patriotism, with Rep. Jim Himes saying, "That was designed exclusively to give the right-wing media an opportunity to attack your loyalties."</p>
