      <p>The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a Bill to replace an ordinance promulgated to reduce corporate tax to 22 per cent to boost the economy.</p>
      <p>After the Cabinet meeting here, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said decision has been taken to bring the bill to replace the ordinance.</p>
      <p>The Bill is likely to be introduced in Parliament during the ongoing Winter Session, sources said.</p>
      <p>On September 20, Sitharaman said the revenue foregone on reduction in corporate tax and other relief measures would be Rs 1.45 lakh crore annually.</p>
      <p>Following the decision, the corporate tax rate has come down to 22 per cent for domestic companies if they do not avail any incentive or concession.</p>
      <p>Also, companies opting for 22 per cent income tax slab would not have to pay minimum alternative tax (MAT).</p>
      <p>The tax rate has been reduced to 15 per cent for new domestic manufacturing companies incorporated after October 1.</p>
      <p>The government had also announced not to levy enhanced surcharge introduced in the Budget on capital gains arising from sale of equity shares in a company liable for securities transaction tax (STT).</p>
      <p>Besides, the government had decided that listed companies which have announced buyback of shares prior to July 5 will not be charged with super-rich tax.</p>
