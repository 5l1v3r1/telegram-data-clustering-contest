        <b>The tradition of ice bathing in Russia dates back to the 16th century. Orthodox Christians believe that taking a dip in the freezing water on 19 January is an important part of celebrating Epiphany, or Baptism Day, to wash away one's sins.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The custom was quite popular even during Soviet times, though it had no relation to religion. The practice of ice swimming is called <i>morzhevanie, </i>and those who take part in it are <i>morzhi (</i>Russian for <i>walruses).</i></p>
      <p>Warning: you'd better not attempt this without the necessary preparation. And while you decide on whether to try ice swimming or not - enjoy Sputnik's photo gallery.</p>
