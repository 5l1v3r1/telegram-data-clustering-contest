      <h1>Nick Saban Issues Update On Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:54:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>College football fans may have seen the last of Tua Tagovailoa in Tuscaloosa, as the star quarterback went down with a season-ending injury this past weekend. On Monday, he underwent surgery on his dislocated right hip.</p>
      <p>Many scouts had Tagovailoa listed as the top quarterback prospect for the 2020 NFL Draft. This injury could open the door for Joe Burrow or Justin Herbert to leapfrog him on draft boards though.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Laura Rutledge, Tagovailoa will be on a partial weight-bearing plan for the next six weeks. The estimated recovery time for him is six-to-eight months.</p>
      <p>Judging off Nick Saban’s recent comments, the star quarterback won’t let this negative situation weigh him down.</p>
      <p>“I talk to him every day. He’s in good spirits, and he’s doing well,” Saban said. “I think all the indications from the surgery have been really positive from a medical standpoint. I think he’s got a really good understanding of what he’s looking at.”</p>
      <p>This is yet another promising update on Tagovailoa, who is expected to make a full recovery.</p>

      <p>Saban has received tons of criticism for playing Tagovailoa in a blowout win over Mississippi State. However, the legendary coach did reveal that he only planned on using him for one more drive – the drive where he suffered the hip injury.</p>
      <p>Now that Tagovailoa’s season is over, the Crimson Tide will have to rely on Mac Jones.</p>
      <p>Jones will start this Saturday for Alabama as it hosts Western Carolina.</p>
