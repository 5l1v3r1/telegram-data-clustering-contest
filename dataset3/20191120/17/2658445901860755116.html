      <p>Justice Taofikat Oyekan-Abdullahi of an Ikeja High Court has ordered that the Eko Electricity Distribution Plc (EKDC) must issue notice to its customers three days before power interruption.</p>
      <p>Justice Oyekan-Abdullahi made the orders Wednesday while ruling in a suit filed by one Mr. Bolaji Ramos seeking both declaratory and injunctive reliefs against the EKEDC.</p>
      <p>At the resumed hearing Wednesday, the court, after hearing argument on the originating summons by Ramos, granted three out of the four reliefs sought from the court.</p>
      <p>Among the reliefs granted by the court are: “An order that the interruption of the claimant’s electricity supply by the defendant without a minimum of three working-day prior notice is illegal, unlawful and in violation of NERC’s Customer Service Standards of Performance for Distribution Companies 2007, made pursuant to Electric Power Sector Reform Act (No.6 of 2005).</p>
      <p>“An order that the Defendant may only cause planned or deliberate interruption of the Claimant’s electricity supply only after giving a minimum of three (3) working-day prior notice of such interruption and</p>
      <p>“An order that the Defendant may only cause planned or deliberate interruption of the Claimant’s electricity supply only for the purpose of maintaining its equipment, and such interruption must be preceded by a minimum of three (3) working-day prior notice in line with NERC’s Customer Service Standards of Performance for Distribution Companies 2007, made pursuant to Electric Power Sector Reform Act (No.6 of 2005)”.</p>

      <p>Justice Oyekan-Abdullahi ordered that the orders of the court shall apply to the whole of Ijesha, Surulere, Lagos State and other areas in Lagos State within the coverage of operations of EKDC.</p>
      <p>She ordered the parties to appear at the next adjourned date to address her on the remaining reliefs to enable the court make an informed decision.</p>
      <p>Ramos had sought the court’s interpretation of the provisions of Regulation 4 of the Customer Service Standards of Performance for Distribution Companies Regulations 2007, Section 32 and 80 of the Electric Power Sector Reform Act 2005.</p>
      <p>He had also prayed the court to grant both declaratory and injunctive reliefs in the event that the questions set out for the court were answered in the affirmative.</p>
      <p>Justice Abdullahi-Oyekan has adjourned the case until January 13, 2020 for argument in respect of the remaining reliefs sought in the Originating Summons by the claimant.</p>
