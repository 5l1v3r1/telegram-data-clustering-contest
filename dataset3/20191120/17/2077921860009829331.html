      <h1>Watch Oso Oso Perform Songs from Basking in the Glow in the Paste Studio</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lizzie Manno  </a></address>
      <p>Emo outfit Oso Oso (aka New Yorker Jade Lilitri) stopped by the <i>Paste</i> Studio in Manhattan to perform songs from their new album <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/08/oso-oso-basking-in-the-glow-review.html"><i>Basking in the Glow</i></a>, out now via Triple Crown Records. <i>Paste</i>’s Ben Salmon <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/08/oso-oso-basking-in-the-glow-review.html">wrote</a>, “<i>Basking in the Glow</i> is not only the fulfillment of the promise Lilitri showed on <i>The Yunahon Mixtape</i>, it’s one of the best pop-rock records of 2019.”</p>
      <p>In this session, Lilitri delivers stripped-down versions of his yearning emo-tinged indie rock. Oso Oso performed three songs, all from <i>Basking in the Glow</i>: “the view,” “a morning song” and “dig.” Lilitri also talks about listening to The Ergs and Against Me! in high school and then getting into bands like <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Death+Cab+for+Cutie">Death Cab for Cutie</a>, Weatherbox, The Sidekicks and Hop Along. He also jokes that the Wolfgangs Vault tapes, displayed in the background of the <i>Paste</i> NYC studio, are actually just blackmail.</p>
