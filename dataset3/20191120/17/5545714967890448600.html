      <h1>Review: Golem</h1>
      <h2>An action-adventure gem that requires some patience</h2>

      <p>It's taken <i>Golem</i> longer than expected to make it onto PlayStation VR, and I worry that for some people, the game missed its window of opportunity – that it's going to seem like too little, too late. VR is a fast-moving field, after all. What worked in 2017 or even 2018 doesn't necessarily shine as bright in 2019.</p>
      <p>That's where my headspace was at coming into reviewing <i>Golem</i>. I heard about the game years ago, knew the basic premise – that you play as a housebound young "dreamer" who controls hulking golems in a cordoned-off city – and was just reminded of its existence last week when it launched on PS4.</p>
      <p>In the end, I can't say I was blown away, but I <i>am</i> impressed with what Highwire was able to pull off. For those of us who still use our PSVR headsets, <i>Golem </i>is a sword-clashing adventure worth exploring.</p>

        <b><i>Golem</i> (PlayStation VR [reviewed on a PS4 Pro])<br/>Developer: Highwire Games<br/>Publisher: Perp Games<br/>Released: November 15, 2019<br/>MSRP: $39.99</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a slow-burning intro in which we get to know protagonist Twine, her teenage sister, and their stern but caring father, <i>Golem </i>offers a morsel of what's to come over the next six to seven hours.</p>
      <p>While you technically play as Twine for the duration, the majority of your time will be spent looking – and dueling – through the eyes of a giant stone golem that's able to go where humans cannot: an ancient city full of valuable relics (and other golems who aren't so friendly). There's more backstory to uncover further into <i>Golem</i>, both in a micro and macro sense, but that's the gist. When you aren't trudging along, looking for the next shortcut to open up or artifact to pilfer, you're probably fighting.</p>
      <p>There's a satisfying action-adventure wrapper in here, especially for people who love just-hidden-enough collectibles that serve a storytelling purpose, but the core of <i>Golem</i> is its one-on-one sword-fighting. You'll twist and turn your arm and wrist at high speeds to deflect swings and counter-attack when the time's right. The combat is thrilling; it gets my blood pumping. Even with a hardier health item to back me up and a far-reaching halberd, I still feel tension when facing the lowliest golems.</p>
      <p>That's the idea. Death is meant to be consequential. When you bite the dust in <i>Golem</i>, you'll lose your currently-equipped gear and start back at a central point in the city, so it pays to play cautiously and keep an eye out for shortcuts at all times. I never once "ran out" of crucial items, but I worried about it!</p>

      <p>A word of caution: this is going to be one of those VR games where everyone's results will vary depending on their setup and their comfort level. For me, the hand tracking worked wonderfully – at least most of the time. I definitely lost a few skirmishes that felt unfair, and that can sting pretty badly when it's a long walk back. There's also the game's novel movement system – to walk, you lean your head forward while holding down the trigger on your PlayStation Move – and the whole game-within-a-game conceit. For added immersion, Twine's room is visible in your periphery when you're a golem.</p>
      <p>With or without VR experience, it's a lot to take in. I needed a good hour-and-a-half before I was truly comfortable. But once everything clicked, I was seamlessly walking around and fighting using a single PlayStation Move controller. (Alternatively, you can hold a DualShock 4 in your other hand, but that control scheme isn't ideal.) Best-case scenario, your golem will feel like an extension of your body, and that's ultimately where I landed once I learned the quirks and how to work with them, not against them.</p>
      <p>Beyond all the hectic duels, the quieter moments spent exploring the city are fun in their own right thanks to well-layered world design and a brilliant, serene soundtrack from <i>Halo </i>composer Martin O'Donnell. I don't really care to track down every last relic, but I've gone out of my way to try and find all the collectible echoes – short audio messages from Twine's mother that help fill in the story gaps.</p>

      <p><i>Golem</i>'s scope is just about right – no VR qualifiers needed. It feels like a full experience. Another enemy type or two could've gone a long way (the pesky spear guys aren't enough), but I'm mostly happy.</p>
      <p>I want to duck back in for a couple more hours at some point, and hopefully the tracking oddities will have been smoothed over by then. It sounds like Highwire is looking to add <a href="https://highwiregames.com/2019/11/17/tracking-for-v1-02-patch/">more control options</a>, too. If you're in any way unsure about the current controls or possible discomfort, I'd advise caution.</p>
      <p>When everything comes together, <i>Golem</i> has some of the best PlayStation VR combat I've played, and a story worth hearing. When it's off, even a little, frustration follows. If you can tolerate backtracking and don't mind dealing with occasional VR tech idiosyncrasies, you're gonna have a grand time.</p>
