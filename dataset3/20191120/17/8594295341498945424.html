      <h1>Not About That Base? Kia Said to Drop Low-end Stinger Trims in Favor of a Lesser GT</h1>

      <p>Kia earned applause for being ballsy enough to launch a rear-drive sports sedan at a time when buyers were heading in the other direction. <i>Don’t go</i>, Kia said, <i>we’ve got a more affordable option for traditional driving!</i></p>
      <p>Rear- or all-wheel drive greeted buyers looking for something fresh, with four- or six-cylinder power doing the motivating. Since its late-2017 arrival, the Stinger’s sales have fallen off a bit from last year’s tally, when it sold in low but consistent numbers. For 2020, the brand may be looking to reduce build configurations.</p>
      <p>That means less four-cylinder choice and the removal of the model’s entry-level model. Apparently, this won’t cause much pain to your wallet.</p>
      <p>This tidbit comes by way of<i><a href="https://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/2020-kia-stinger-will-limit-2-0t-availability-add-gt-flair?src=20&amp;lnk=je6NUbpObpQ-ealDiXcynq8dDRAlZwNDjg"> CarsDirect</a></i>, which got its hands on an early order guide. It would seem that for the coming model year, Kia aims to make the sportier GT a bigger player. Or at least its looks.</p>
      <p>Gone are the 2.0L Base and Premium, replaced with a single four-cylinder trim called GT-Line. Reminiscent of Hyundai’s N-Line models, the new trim adopts the more aggressive styling of the V6-powered GT while skipping the cylinder bloat. Starting at $34,085 after destination, the GT-Line is only a $100 walk up from the former base model.</p>

      <p>Sporting the 2.0-liter mill (255 horsepower, 260 lb-ft of torque) and an eight-speed automatic, the GT-Line adopts a meaner grille and fascia, darkened trim, body-color door handles, and 18-inch wheels. Inside, there’s stitching and badging galore. A sport-style steering wheel greets guests, wrapped in leather.</p>
      <p>While is mostly a bonus for entry-level buyers, the news isn’t so great for those wanting extra content. With the Premium off the table, anyone looking for extra creature comforts will have to settle for the GT, which retails for $40,495 after destination. That’s a $200 bump from 2019. At least with this trim, they’ll gain a turbocharged 3.3-liter V6 making 365 horses.</p>
      <p>While the Premium was practically spooning the GT in terms of price, it did offer some features found on the loftier GT1, making its absence more strongly felt.</p>
      <p>That said, if you can find a 2019 Premium, there’s a good chance Kia has a bundle of incentives waiting for you. November’s a good time to buy.</p>
