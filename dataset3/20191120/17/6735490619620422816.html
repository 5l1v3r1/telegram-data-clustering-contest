      <p>On Wednesday, the tech giant announced that they would be cancelling the AFI Fest premiere of “The Banker”, which had originally been set to close the festival on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We purchased ‘The Banker’ earlier this year as we were moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy,” an Apple representative said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps. In light of this, we are no longer premiering ‘The Banker’ at AFI Fest,” the statement continued.</p>
      <p>Apple has since said that the concerns in question were regarding the real-life subjects that the drama film is based on.</p>

      <p>Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Anthony Mackie, “The Banker” tells the story of revolutionary businessman Bernard Garrett, one of the first African-American bankers, who built a financial empire by training a working class white man to pose as the rich privileged face of their banking empire.</p>
      <p>The film is set to hit theatres on Dec. 6 before making its way to Apple’s new streaming service, Apple TV+, early next year.</p>
