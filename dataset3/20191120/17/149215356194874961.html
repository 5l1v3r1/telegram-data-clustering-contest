    <meta property="og:description" content="In what is becoming common practice for the Trump administration, Vice President Mike Pence's office responded critically Wednesday to an impeachment witness' public sworn testimony while a hearing was ongoing. Pence's Chief of Staff Marc Short released a statement denying U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's claim that he brought up concerns he had that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was &quot;tied to investigations&quot; directly with Pence in September. That would mean Sondland directly discussed a potential quid pro quo with the vice president. Short said that the &quot;alleged discussion recalled by Ambassador never happened&quot; and that Sondland was &quot;never alone with&quot; Pence while the two were on a trip to Warsaw, Poland, in September, when Sondland testified the conversation took place.
