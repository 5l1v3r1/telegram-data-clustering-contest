      <h1>Union Cabinet approves import of 1.2 lakh tonnes onion</h1>

      <p>The Union Cabinet on November 20 gave its approval to the Food Ministry’s recent decision to import 1.2 lakh tonnes of onions in a bid to improve the domestic availability of the key kitchen staple and check prices. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman informed about the decision at a media briefing after the Cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p>On November 16, Food and Consumer Affai₹ Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had announced that the government will import 1,00,000 tonnes of onions through state-run MMTC, which has already floated a tender for buying 4,000 tonnes of the commodity from the global market. The government is also facilitating private imports and also relaxed phytosanitary and fumigation norms till December.</p>
      <p>The move comes after the government’s various efforts to boost the domestic availability failed to cool down the retail prices significantly. Retail prices of onions are continuing to rule above ₹60/kg in the national capital and other consuming centres.</p>
      <p>Onion prices have come under pressure due to 26% fall in the production to 52.06 lakh tonnes during the kharif output late-kharif seasons of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>The all-India average retail price of onion stood at ₹60.38 per kg on November 15, compared with ₹22.84 per kg on the same date last year.</p>
      <p>Besides easing norms for onion import, the government has taken several measures including ban on exports, stock limits on trade₹ and sale of the commodity stored as buffer, at a subsidised rate.</p>
