        <b>Nearly 100 Preston homes have been repossessed by court order over the last five years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ministry of Justice statistics show county court bailiffs have repossessed 94 properties mortgaged by homeowners in the area since October 2014.</p>
      <p>Of these, seven repossessions took place between July and September this year, the latest quarter for which data is available – equivalent to 11.8 in every 100,000 households.</p>
      <p>Mortgage lenders can take possession of a property through a county court as a last resort to recover money owed.</p>
      <p>But because many cases do not make it to court, the number of repossessions could be much higher.</p>
      <p>Since 2014, lenders have lodged 347 court claims for properties in Preston.</p>
      <p>These led to judges granting:</p>
      <p>* 134 orders for people to leave their homes by a certain date. These decisions can be appealed or later rescinded.</p>
      <p>* 90 suspended possession orders letting homeowners stay, providing they keep up their payments and pay back funds owed; and</p>
      <p>* 308 warrants to evict people in breach of previous orders.</p>
      <p>Across England and Wales, bailiffs repossessed 25,068 mortgaged properties over the five-year period.</p>
      <p>There were 1,205 repossessions between July and September this year – up 29 per cent on the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Court claims, mortgage orders and warrants are also up from last year, but remain well below levels seen in previous years.</p>
      <p>Trade association UK Finance said the increase was partly driven by a backlog of older cases being processed.</p>
      <p>Low mortgage rates still help to keep borrowers' repayments relatively affordable overall, it added.</p>
      <p>Following the economic downturn in 2008, lending rules were tightened to discourage borrowers from taking out loans they could not pay back.</p>
      <p>Fewer homeowners and landlords are now in arrears with their mortgage compared to a year ago, the figures show.</p>
      <p>"Lenders continue to show flexibility to borrowers in financial difficulty and possession is always a last resort," UK Finance's report into the latest statistics said.</p>
      <p>It continued: "The proportion of homeowner mortgages in arrears remains at historically low levels, with the vast majority of borrowers continuing to repay their mortgages in full and on time each month."</p>
