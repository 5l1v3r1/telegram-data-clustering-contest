      <p>Axel Tuanzebe had to pull out of the Liverpool clash on October 20 after picking up a hip injury in the warm-up.

      <p>Scott McTominay, who has been a hugely important player for Solskjaer this season, is a doubt with the ankle injury that he picked up against Brighton before the international break. The midfielder was absent from Scotland's two recent games and could again miss out this weekend.</p>
