      <h1>What Do We Hear When Women Speak?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:58:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:58</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Bennett</a></address>
      <p>Carole Simpson, a longtime television newscaster, was told early in her career that she could not be an anchor because “women don’t like to hear other women on the air.”</p>
      <p>“Women’s voices are shrill and not authoritative enough,” one boss told her, noting that news coming out of their mouths “sounds like gossip.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Simpson worked to make her voice deeper, “pitching it to a lower register” to project the sound from her diaphragm. “I was lucky, I had taken theater in school,” she said. “It was great preparation.”</p>
      <p>By the time she was tapped, in 1992, to moderate a presidential debate between George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot — only the third woman, and the first woman of color, to have done so at the time — she said her voice was the last thing she was worried about. By then a correspondent at ABC, she’d had just five days to prepare. She was told they wanted an “Oprah-style town hall.” (Is this why they’d given a black woman a chance, she wondered?) She said it felt as if everyone was saying to her: You’re the first (insert woman, or person of color). Don’t screw this up.</p>
      <p>Ms. Simpson, now retired, reflected on that moment by phone this week as she prepared to tune in to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/19/us/politics/november-democratic-debate.html?module=inline">fifth Democratic presidential debate</a> on Wednesday — in which eight women will speak on camera as both candidates and<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/business/media/democratic-debate-female-moderators.html?module=inline"> moderators</a>. The moderator lineup is the second all-female panel for a major debate, and will feature the MSNBC host<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show"> Rachel Maddow</a>, the veteran NBC correspondent<a href="https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell"> Andrea Mitchell</a>, the NBC reporter<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Welker"> Kristen Welker</a> and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/ashley-parker/?tid=lk_inline_manual_1"> Ashley Parker</a> of The Washington Post, which is co-hosting the event with MSNBC.</p>
      <p>The visual optics of that lineup are important, said Pat Mitchell, the former president of PBS and CNN who is co-chair of the Women’s Media Center. “Stereotypes still continue about what authority looks like, what power looks like, what credibility looks like,” she said. But the sound is important too.</p>
      <p>The assessment that someone “sounds presidential” is typically used to describe the substance of what a candidate is saying. But <i>how</i> they say it — the micro-nuances of their speech patterns, and how voters, and viewers, hear them — can also provide a fascinating window into how we perceive authority and who occupies it.</p>
      <p>Women and men tend to have different speech patterns, linguists will tell you. Women, especially young women, tend to have more versatile intonation. They place more emphasis on certain words; they are playful with language and have shorter and thinner vocal cords, which produce a higher pitch. That isn’t absolute, nor is it necessarily a bad thing — unless, of course, you are a person with a higher pitch trying to present yourself with some kind of authority. This basic contradiction has kept speech coaches in business for decades.</p>
      <p>Margaret Thatcher famously trained to deepen her voice in an attempt to give herself more authority. Claims of being too “shrill” — a word that, according to a<a href="https://linguisticpulse.com/2016/02/08/bashing-hillary-clintons-voice-screeching-shrieking-and-shrill/"> 2016 linguistic analysis</a>, was used twice as often to refer to women than men in media articles during that era — dogged Hillary Clinton in both of her campaigns for the presidency, despite one analysis showing that her voice<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/493814/the-science-behind-hating-hillarys-voice/"> was average in pitch and loudness for her age and gender</a>.</p>
      <p>Last year, when Vicki Sparks, a sports journalist, became the first woman to announce a men’s World Cup match live on British television, she was criticized for being too “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/06/26/i-prefer-to-hear-a-male-voice-women-commentators-find-harsh-judgment-at-world-cup/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.26aec9198cbd">high pitched</a>” by a former player who noted that he simply preferred “a male voice when watching football.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t have a problem with the idea that your voice is important if you’re a broadcaster or a politician. It’s part of the reason I have this job,” said Lulu Garcia-Navarro, the host of “Weekend Edition Sunday” on NPR. “My problem is when people come up and say, ‘I don’t want to hear you, because your voice annoys me.’ It automatically disqualifies a whole swath of people. Because what are they comparing you to? They’re comparing you to a white man.”</p>
      <p>(In a recent article, NPR’s public editor noted that when it comes to listener complaints about its newscasters’ voices, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2019/08/07/749060986/sounding-like-a-reporter-and-a-real-person-too">the “vast majority” are directed at women and reporters of color</a>.)</p>
      <p>In a course called “Sounding American,” at the University of California at Berkeley, Tom McEnaney, a professor of comparative literature and Portuguese and Spanish, teaches that there is in fact a sound that people associate with authority in this country — and, while it is constantly evolving, it has its roots in many things, one of which is early broadcast technology. Dating back to the phonograph, he said, engineers had created a device that was designed for the male voice — newscasters, presidents, public figures — to the extent that if a woman spoke into it, her voice would sound distorted, thin or scrambled.</p>
      <p>“The mic wouldn’t pick up certain ranges of voice,” Professor McEnaney said. “If a woman wanted to speak and get her voice recorded, she had to produce more volume and more energy to make the same marks. She could try to speak lower, or she could shout. But she’d have to change her voice.”</p>
      <p>Over time, that technology improved — but he thinks the deep-rooted association between female voices and sonic distortion leads to the seemingly strong (albeit frequently subconscious) reaction that many people have to the higher pitch.</p>
      <p>“So there was a bias in the engineering. That bias in the engineering produced distortion, which was mistakenly associated with women’s voices, and then listeners, even after that correction, used that association as the justification for their ongoing prejudice against women’s voices,” Professor McEnaney said. “And those carry up to the present day.”</p>
      <p>Indeed, a<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0051216"> 2012 study published in PLoS ONE</a> found that both men and women prefer male and female leaders who have lower-pitched voices, while a <a href="http://web.as.miami.edu/personal/cklofstad/25_polpsych_pitch.pdf">2015 report in a journal called Political Psychology</a> determined, in a sample of U.S. adults, that Americans prefer political candidates with lower voices as well.</p>
      <p>Lower voices do carry better, so that’s not entirely without basis, said the linguist Deborah Tannen. That would help explain why those with higher voices, of any gender — but particularly those who speak in public — tend to adopt all sorts of tricks to project: slowing down their pace, lowering their tone, adjusting their cadence.</p>
      <p>“Women come into training sessions more aware of what they need to work on because they have been dealing with the tone police all of their lives,” said Christine Jahnke, a speech coach who has worked with a number of Democratic politicians.</p>
      <p>She noted how, in the first debate in the Democratic primary, Senator <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/kamala-harris.html?module=inline">Kamala Harris</a>’s<a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/06/28/joe-biden-kamala-harris-race-busing-nbc-democratic-debate-bts-vpx.nbc"> carefully measured tone as she confronted</a> former Vice President <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/elections/joe-biden.html?module=inline">Joseph R. Biden Jr.</a> was widely praised.</p>
      <p>“Her pace was the delivery technique that enabled her to command the stage,” said Ms. Jahnke. “If you listen carefully, you will notice how slowly she is speaking and how she uses pauses to add drama.”</p>
      <p>In the heyday of television broadcasting there was a style of delivery known as the “voice of God” that was used to refer to the “almost exaggerated authority” of newscasters like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite, said Jane Hall, a communication professor at American University. It was “presenting the news from on high.”</p>
      <p>“And guess what?” Professor Hall said. “God” is no longer male.</p>
      <p>“I think we are past the point of questioning whether women have the ‘gravitas’ or the ‘authority’ to moderate these debates,” she said.</p>
      <p>And with that out of the way, perhaps viewers can focus on what they — and the candidates — actually say.</p>
