        <b>What a great picture from the International Space Station. It’s taken during the recent spacewalk to service the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer – aka the anti-matter hunter AMS-02 – on the Mini-Research Module 2.</b>

      <p>It’s a pic of Luca Parmitano, an astronaut for the European Space agency (and a Colonel in the Italian Air Force). He was out on the Canadarm2 robotic arm of the module.</p>
      <p>I got this via twitter.</p>

      <p>You can see his shot of the space station below.</p>

      <p>An ESA description of the operation is:</p>
      <blockquote>A carefully planned and detailed affair, all spacewalks require coordination and lots of work from many people on ground. The four spacewalks for AMS-02 are exceptionally difficult as the bus-sized facility was never designed to be maintained in space.<br/><br/>The cooling pumps for AMS-02 are failing and without them it will no longer be able to collect data on the cosmic rays that are bombarding our planet. The first question spacewalk designers had to answer was “is it even possible?”</blockquote>
      <p>So far so good, but more servicing is still required – ESA reports that “two possible showstoppers are out of the way and the servicing of the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer is well underway”.</p>
      <p>You can read more on the ESA website and Luca Parmitano’s blog.</p>
