      <p>The Hyundai Ioniq has been on sale since 2016 and was the world's first model to be offered with three electrified powertrains including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and full electric. To keep up with the competition, the Ioniq has been given a significant upgrade for the 2020 model year. Debuting at the 2019 LA Auto Show, the new 2020 Hyundai Ioniq arrives with fresh styling, an upgraded interior, and a significantly improved range.</p>
      <p>The new Ioniq Electric's battery has been upgraded from 28 kWh to 38.3 kWh. With 36 percent more energy storage capacity, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/ioniq-ev">2020 Hyundai Ioniq Electric</a> delivers a range of 170 miles between charges, beating the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/nissan/leaf">Nissan Leaf</a>. An electric motor delivers 134 horsepower and 218 lb-ft of torque and current 6.6-kW charger has been upgraded to 7.2-kW. Using a 100-kW fast-charging station, the battery can be charged up to 84 percent in 54 minutes. With a combined 133 MPGe, the Hyundai Ioniq Electric is one of the most efficient EVs on the market. Like the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/kona-ev">Hyundai Kona Electric</a>, the Ioniq electric adopts one-pedal driving, allowing the driver to stop the car by holding onto the left paddle-shift lever often without having to apply the brake pedal.</p>
