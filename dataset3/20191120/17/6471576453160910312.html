      <p>As Kia insisted on telling us when the Stinger came out a couple of years ago, this car represents great value. Yes, you could have a BMW 3 Series for the money, but it would have this cool look or the same level of equipment. Volkswagen may be German, but it's more of an underdog in America.</p>
      <p>The construction and powertrain are totally different, but the Arteon is similar in several ways to the Stinger. For starters, it's intentionally cool, a four-door coupe with a liftback trunk. It too tries to give you more than BMW or Mercedes, plus it does a better job in the practicality department.</p>
      <p>This review from Throttle House pits the Arteon R-Line against a Stinger GT, bost costing around $50,000. We've honestly been waiting a while to see these two matched up. The Kia looks cool, but many owners have complained about the gas mileage and especially the tires.</p>
      <p>The Arteon has no hope of competing in the performance department since it's powered by a smaller engine and comes with a front-drive platform. More specifically, the 2.0 TSI makes 268 hp and 258 lb-ft ( 350 Nm), going through an 8-speed auto to the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/a.html#ge-all-wheel-drive"><u>AWD</u></a> system. Think of this as a luxurious Golf R. Meanwhile, the 3.3-liter twin-turbo Kia develops 365 hp and 376 lb-ft (510 Nm), so about a hundred more of each. Power goes primarily to the back wheels, making it more dynamic.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen says it's<a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/volkswagen-wants-r-versions-of-tiguan-touareg-and-arteon-to-battle-amg-120077.html"> working on an Arteon R</a>, which will come out next year, presumably with a turbo VR6 or a 2.5 TFSI. However, there's no way it will be priced the same as this Kia, which thus becomes a bit of a value king. What would you prefer, a powerful Kia or a VW coupe? Let us know in the comments.</p>
      <p>We almost forgot to mention the things that make the Arteon good. Rear legroom and comfort are fantastic while the dashboard is a little bit better built. We're not that impressed with it, especially since the analog clock looks so old-fashioned. But the screens are about as good as Audi's, it rides better than the Stinger and could be just the car to relax you. üèÅ</p>
