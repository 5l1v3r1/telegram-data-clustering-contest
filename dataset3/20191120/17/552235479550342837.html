      <p>Scotland midfielder <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> is above the likes of Kevin de Bruyne, Luka Modric and Sergio Busquets according to a UEFA performance metric.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> star scored twice against Kazakhstan last night to take his total to seven in Euro 2020 qualification - one more than Poland and Bayern Munich superstar Robert Lewandowski.</p>
      <p>McGinn has also provided two assists in the campaign so far and, at least according to UEFA, he's performing better than some of the game's top midfielders.</p>

      <p>The FedEx Performance Zone tracks players international form from the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nations-league">Nations League</a> all the way through to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Each player is given different metrics based on their position on the pitch, and their statistics are run through a specially-designed algorithm.</p>
      <p>The algorithm takes stats from the Nations League, Euro 2020 qualifiers and friendlies to give a performance ranking which changes after each match.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>McGinn has been rising quickly through the rankings and is currently 47th overall, just ahead of Finland striker Teemu Pukki and four places behind Italy's Marco Verratti.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> star is also ahead of Paris Saint-Germain superstar Kylian Mbappé, Napoli's Dries Mertens and de Bruyne of Manchester City.</p>

      <p>The ranking takes into account all positions, with different statistics used for each, and arguably the most impressive thing is how McGinn fares compared to his fellow central midfielders.</p>
      <p>Reigning Ballon d'Or winner Modric is 11 places behind McGinn after his performances for Croatia, with Barcelona and Spain's Busquets down in 66th place and Bosnia's Miralem Pjanic, who plays his club football for Juventus, is in 84th place.</p>
      <p>According to the ranking, the best performing international player since the start of the Nations League has been Memphis Depay of the Netherlands followed by Frenkie de Jong, Jordan Pickford and Mattijs de Ligt.</p>
