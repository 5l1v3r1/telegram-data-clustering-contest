      <h1>Varcoe: With pipelines full, rail strike hits Alberta’s oilpatch at the worst time</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:22:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:22</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Varcoe, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The Alberta government has trains on its brain.</p>
      <p>The pending sale of the provincial government’s crude-by-rail contracts has been percolating for months, with an announcement expected sometime this fall — and the waiting continues.</p>
      <p>But Tuesday brought a full-fledged transportation migraine for the Kenney government, amid news that 3,200 Canadian National Railway Co. workers are <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/transportation/rail/thousands-of-canadian-national-railway-workers-go-on-strike/wcm/739297d6-95a6-4946-aa36-bcb7c3c8bb7a">now on strike</a>.</p>
      <p>It comes at a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/transportation/rail/looming-cn-strike-adds-to-woes-for-already-battered-western-farmers/wcm/168f241b-76b6-4956-9874-1e5881a9ff0f">sensitive time for Alberta farmers</a> trying to move their products to market after a difficult harvest season.</p>
      <p>It also kicks the oilpatch and province firmly in the shins, threatening to interrupt crude-by-rail shipments at a critical time when pipelines are already full, rail shipments are climbing, storage levels are growing and the transportation system has little slack.</p>
      <p>With Parliament not slated to return to work until Dec. 5, Alberta Energy Minister Sonya Savage called for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/local-business/alberta-government-calls-for-emergency-recall-of-parliament-to-address-cn-strike">recall MPs immediately and enact back-to-work legislation</a>.</p>
      <p>She noted CN moves between 170,000 and 180,000 barrels of oil per day out of Western Canada.</p>
      <p>“We are already under extreme capacity constraints because of the failure to build pipelines,” Savage told reporters at the legislature.</p>
      <p>“The entire economy and Canada could be extremely affected by the failure to be able to move, not only our energy product, but every single product.”</p>

      <p>Federal Labour Minister Patty Hajdu issued a statement pressing CN and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference to continue negotiations, saying the government is monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p>Analysts warn it won’t take long for a rail disruption to squeeze Alberta oil prices, coming on the heels of a <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/commodities/energy/alberta-oil-piles-up-amid-keystone-xl-closure-delay-in-rail-contracts-announcement/wcm/51461d01-ec1f-440a-855b-69bf24fc6025">leak last month on the Keystone pipeline system</a> in the United States.</p>
      <p>The situation also underscores just how critical transportation issues are for Alberta’s largest industries that rely on rail to get products to export markets.</p>
      <p>Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen noted farmers have already endured a tough year and if rail shipments are delayed, “it piles up like a snowball.”</p>
      <p>On the oil side, data released by the Canadian Energy Regulator on Tuesday show crude-by-rail exports are on the rise, averaging 320,000 barrels per day in September. Those figures are up three per cent from August, and the highest levels reported since January.</p>
      <p>Rail shipments were expected to keep climbing throughout the rest of the year as oil output outstrips pipeline capacity.</p>
      <p>Last month, the Kenney government changed its curtailment policy so that petroleum producers affected by output quotas can exceed their cap beginning in December, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/business/energy/alberta-set-to-let-producers-hike-oil-output-if-companies-add-rail-shipments">if they add incremental crude-by-rail capacity</a>.</p>
      <p>Some companies are already planning on doing that, but a protracted rail strike could sidetrack those efforts.</p>
      <p>The issue also comes as a leak last month in the Keystone pipeline in North Dakota now has that system operating at reduced pressure levels.</p>
      <p>“If it doesn’t rain, it pours, right. It’s just one thing after another, it seems,” ARC Energy Research Institute executive director Peter Tertzakian said of the labour dispute and its potential impacts on rail shipments.</p>
      <p>“Near term, it is very damaging. The financial consequences are measured in millions of dollars a day … and other industries are losing money, too.”</p>

      <p>Prices for Western Canada Select heavy oil fell by $4.45 to close at US$36.45 on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Energy analyst Kevin Birn of IHS Markit said it’s reasonable to expect some weakness in the price differentials on Western Canadian oil if there is a disruption caused by the CN strike, but the impact will depend on the length and extent of any problems.</p>
      <p>Without access to pipeline capacity or oil moving by train, more crude will end up going into storage.</p>
      <p>“If the duration is short, the impact should be more muted,” Birn said, noting ongoing pipeline optimization in the next few weeks will help moderate some of the fallout.</p>
      <p>“We already hit the snag of Keystone and that tripped up and put pressure on inventories. Now we have hit another snag. Do these compound a situation — it becomes a question of the duration.”</p>
      <p>Data from research firm Genscape Inc. indicates inventory levels have been building in the past two months in Western Canada after dropping due to curtailment.</p>
      <p>Oil inventory levels in the region sat around 25 million barrels for the week ending Oct. 25, after hitting highs of 37 million barrels in April and last December.</p>
      <p>However, following the Keystone leak, storage levels in Western Canada shot up by almost five million barrels in just one week to hit 30 million barrels as of Nov. 1, said Mike Walls, a senior oil analyst with Genscape.</p>
      <p>“The entire Western Canadian oil industry is hyper-sensitive to any outage for takeaway,” he said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“With Keystone being down, a lot of producers and shippers were scrambling for rail and getting crude onto rail cars. As they were scrambling for that, now we run into the situation of a strike, so it’s been a manic November for Western Canadian oil.”</p>

      <p>Officials with Imperial Oil and Cenovus Energy, two of the largest producers with the capacity to ramp up crude-by-rail shipments, say they’re monitoring the situation closely.</p>
      <p>Ben Brunnen of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers said the sector is concerned about the availability of rail shipments being impacted by the strike, in light of the ongoing shortage of pipeline capacity.</p>
      <p>As for the province off-loading its own crude-by-rail agreements — deals signed by the former NDP government that will move up to 120,000 barrels per day out of Alberta — work is continuing on their sale, according to the energy minister’s press secretary.</p>
      <p>An announcement is expected in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>But until a sale is complete — and the labour situation affecting CN is resolved — the Alberta government will remain focused on rail, waiting for its train troubles to pass on by.</p>
