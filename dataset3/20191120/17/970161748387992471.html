      <p>A farm in a Berkshire village has come up with a creative solution to predators savaging its poultry.</p>
      <p>These vigilant alpacas have been given the important task of protecting bronze turkeys raised at the Copas family farm in Cookham.</p>
      <p>They were first introduced in 2016 to protect 24,000 of the free range birds from being attacked in the night.</p>
      <p>Before they came along 160 turkeys were killed in a single year, but the alpacas have since kept the death toll at zero.</p>
      <p>The farm said: ‘We now have 10 beautiful boys at our farm and are on the lookout for more friends to join them.’</p>

      <p>They might seem like an unusual choice of security guard, but Tom Copas, who owns the family business, says they’re used across the globe to fend off dogs and coyotes.</p>

      <p>He told the BBC: ‘We’ve always had dogs that keep the birds safe, but they can’t be on the ranges all the time, unlike the alpacas who stay there day and night.’</p>
      <p>Tom says they also get on much more with their current protectors compared to canines.</p>
      <p>After the birds were taken away last year, Copas Traditional Turkeys e-commerce and marketing manager Simon Windsor <a href="https://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/gallery/cookhams/139348/turkeys-to-be-donated-to-those-in-need-by-cookham-farm.html">told the Maidenhead Advertiser:</a> ‘It’s a bit strange seeing them on their own now all the turkeys are gone, but they don’t seem too lonely.’</p>
