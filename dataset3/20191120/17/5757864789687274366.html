      <p>The Hindenburg disaster signaled the end of the <a href="https://www.livescience.com/58959-hindenburg-crash.html">Airship Era</a> and the rise of Nazi Germany. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/16/us/werner-doehner-dead-hindenburg-disaster.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a> reports, Werner G. Doehner, the last surviving passenger of the historic crash, died on November 8 at age 90.</p>
      <p>Doehner was just 8 years old when he boarded the Hindenburg with his father, mother, brother, and sister in early May 1937. The family made up five of the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/werner-doehner-last-hindenburg-survivor-has-died-90-180973574/">97</a> passengers and crew members who took the three-day flight from Germany to the United States.</p>
      <p>In New Jersey, the German airship's voyage was cut short: It erupted into a ball of flame during its descent, an accident that likely resulted from static electricity igniting a hydrogen leak. Werner Doehner spent several months in a hospital with severe burns on his arms, legs, and face. His father and sister were among the 36 people who perished in the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Doehner went on to live a long life. After the disaster, he returned with his surviving family to Mexico City, the place were he grew up. He continued to live there with his wife Elin and his son Bernie until 1984, when he moved to the United States with his family to work as an engineer for General Electric. Bernie Doehner shared that his father didn't like to talk about his memories of the Hindenburg disasterâ€”though they did make a solemn visit to the site of the crash when Bernie was an adolescent.</p>
      <p>Werner Doehner died of complications related to pneumonia earlier this month in Laconia, New Hampshire. He had been the <a href="https://patch.com/connecticut/darien/remembering-hindenburg-survivors-75-years-after-disas358ce657e4">youngest passenger</a> on board the Hindeburg's final voyage, and at age 90, he was the last remaining survivor.</p>
