      <h1>NFL Insider Has Update On Chiefs Star WR Tyreek Hill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:30:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Fans in Kansas City held their breath when Tyreek Hill left Monday night’s game with a hamstring injury. Even though he missed all of the second half against the Los Angeles Chargers, it appears his latest injury isn’t too serious.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, the talented wideout missed several games because of a shoulder injury. His return to the team has helped open up the offense in ways they couldn’t before.</p>
      <p>Kansas City struggled to push the ball down the field without him this past Monday. It would be a huge blow to the offense if he couldn’t suit up in Week 13 against the Oakland Raiders, but it’s possible he’s ready for that AFC West matchup.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Chiefs believe Hill’s hamstring injury is minor.</p>
      <p>The team is listing him as day-to-day and believes there is a chance he doesn’t miss any time.</p>
      <p>Hill reportedly wanted to go back in the game against the Chargers, but the coaching staff wanted to be cautious with their All-Pro wide receiver.</p>

      <p>Hill has 33 receptions for 543 yards and five touchdowns this year.</p>
      <p>With the playoffs less than two months away, the Chiefs are going to need Hill on the field if they want to make yet another run in the AFC.</p>
