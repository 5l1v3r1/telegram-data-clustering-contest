      <p>Cape Town - Captain <b>Joe Root</b> has urged fast bowler <b>Jofra Arche</b><b>r</b> to not underestimate his own talent as <b>England </b>start their two-match Test series in <b>New Zealand</b> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old Archer is shaping up as a key figure as England start a new era in the longest format with the first Test against the Black Caps starting in Mount Maunganui on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Root has urged his paceman to enjoy his bowling and also believe in himself more.</p>
      <p>The England Test skipper said: "Knowing Jofra, he wants to see the ball moving sideways. But one thing he underestimates his own talent sometimes and that pace through the air can be a quite a big skill in its own.</p>
      <p>"I just want him to go and bowl and enjoy bowling, the different challenges that this part of the world will throw at him.</p>
      <p>"I want him to come away from it learning there is more than one way of taking 20 wickets, he doesn't have to be seaming or swinging it round corners, we've already seen hostile spells of bowling.</p>
      <p>"Can he tailor that to these conditions? And make sure that he's grown his wealth of knowledge on these types of pitches.</p>
      <p>"He makes it look ridiculously easy with his action and the way he approaches the crease, the nature of his style - but to be able to bowl at that pace for a period of time is a skill in itself and I think he needs to understand that."</p>
      <p>The second Test of the series against the Kiwis will be played in Hamilton from 29 November.</p>
