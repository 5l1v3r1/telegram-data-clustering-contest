      <h1>Couple 'humiliated' when Aldi made them unpack shopping after querying bill for £40 grill</h1>
      <h2>Daniel and Pamela Murray claim the retail company didn't even apologise</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:12:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly Williams, Katie-Ann Gupwell</a></address>
      <p>A couple claim they have been left "embarrassed and humiliated" after they were forced to empty their shopping bags to prove they hadn't purchased a portable gas grill that they were charged for incorrectly.</p>
      <p>Daniel and Pamela Murray visited the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/aldi">Aldi</a> store at <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/rhyl">Rhyl</a> 's Marina Quay for a few items, but were left bewildered when the bill totaled at over £66.</p>
      <p>They later queried the bill, and say the cashier said she had put everything through the scanner that resulted in the total price.</p>
      <p>The couple, who are from Rhyl and are in their 60s, then asked for a receipt to be printed.</p>
      <p>It was later found out that they'd been charged £39.99 for a portable gas grill that they hadn't even purchased.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, a manager was called to attend and they were made to empty their bags in front of a queue of people waiting to be served.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/couple-humiliated-aldi-made-unpack-17277119">North Wales Live</a> , Daniel said: "We'd only popped in for a few things and there was only one till open at the time.</p>
      <p>"We loaded our items onto the belt but we got a shock when the cashier told us the bill was £66.</p>
      <p>"I said: 'That can't be right, we've only got two carrier bags.'</p>
      <p>"I asked her to print a receipt and it was showing £39.99 for a portable gas grill we hadn't even bought.</p>
      <p>"The manager and a security guard were called over and we had to unpack all our shopping so they could check the item wasn't there.</p>
      <p>"By this time a big queue was forming and we felt so embarrassed and humiliated. We didn't even get an apology."</p>

      <p>Daniel went on to explain that, eventually, the £39.99 was deducted from the bill with the total expected only to come in at £26.</p>
      <p>He added: "After the incident I decided to write a letter to the store to say I wasn't happy with how the matter had been handled having not been given an apology.</p>
      <p>"I also wanted to warn them that maybe something had been coded up wrong, in case this happens to someone else who might not notice being overcharged before it's too late.</p>
      <p>"How would people who've left the store prove they hadn't bought it?</p>
      <p>"Anyway, I didn't get any response to my letter, nor to a further email that was sent to the Aldi head office.</p>
      <p>"We don't want anything, we just don't think it's very good customer service."</p>

      <p>The incident is not the first to make the press as the store, which opened in August, has hit the headlines before.</p>
      <p>Customers were left with lump sums coming out of their accounts two months after making purchases after a technical glitch led to card payments not taking instantly during the stores first five weeks of trading.</p>
      <p>The issue allegedly led some families into financial difficulty.</p>
      <p>An Aldi spokesman told North Wales Live: "We have apologised to the family for their experience at the Rhyl store.”</p>
