      <h1>This NYC Hyperlapse Was Made Using 1,272 Crowdsourced Instagram Pics</h1>

      <p>Art director <a href="http://www.samthecobra.com/">Sam Morrison</a> made this 57-second video titled “Typologies of New York City.” It’s a hyperlapse of NYC created entirely out of 1,272 crowdsourced photos of the city found on Instagram.<br/><br/>“I sifted through probably ~100,000 photos on Instagram using location tags and hashtags, then sorted, and then hand-animated in After Effects to create a crowdsourced hyperlapse video of New York City,” Morrison tells PetaPixel. “I think the whole project took roughly 200 hours to create!”</p>
      <p>Morrison says the project explores the fact that busy locations in the world are now photographed from all kinds of angles at all times of the day.</p>
      <p>“Classics are classic for a reason,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTGmxCpo89c">writes</a>. “We’ve all taken these photos.</p>
      <p>“What happens when everything in the world has been photographed? From multiple angles, multiple times per day? Eventually, we’ll piece those photos and videos together to be able to see the entire history of a location from every possible angle.”</p>
