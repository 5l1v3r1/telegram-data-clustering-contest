      <h1>Mason Rudolph Asked If He Instigated Fight With Myles Garrett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:08:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Last Thursday night, an ugly scene unfolded as the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers faced off in a division-rivalry contest.</p>
      <p>Star defensive end Myles Garrett <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/video-myles-garrett-ejected-after-swinging-helmet-at-mason-rudolph">ripped the helmet off of Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph</a> and then hit him with it. Garrett received an indefinite suspension for his actions, while Rudolph reportedly received just a fine.</p>
      <p>On the play, Garrett appeared to hit Rudolph late. Rudolph responded to the hit by appearing to try to take Garrett’s helmet off, which started the brawl.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday morning, Rudolph met with reporters and released a brief statement about that play and the subsequent fallout. After his statement, reporters asked Rudolph if he instigated or said anything to Garrett before the brawl broke out.</p>
      <p>“I definitely didn’t say anything that escalated it. But like I said, I have to do a better job of keeping my composure in those situations,” he said.</p>

      <p>Rudolph apologized to the Steelers and the league for his role in the fight. However, he fell just short of admitting he played a significant part in the brawl.</p>
      <p>Garrett reportedly met with the NFL this morning to appeal his suspension. The CBA does not allow for indefinite suspensions – which he received – so it’s likely the league will attach a number of games to the suspension at some point.</p>
      <p>Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey received a three-game suspension, while Browns defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi received a one-game suspension.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh and Cleveland face off again in just two weeks.</p>
