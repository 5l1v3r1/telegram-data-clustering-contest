        <b>Almost two out of five people believe electric scooters should be made legal for use in roads in the UK, a new study suggests.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A survey of 2,000 adults by Halfords found that most would use an e-scooter if it was legal to do so, with half saying they might use them to commute to work.</p>

      <p>Halfords said the safe use of e-scooters has the potential to "revolutionise" the way people travel and could help tackle pollution and congestion problems.</p>
      <p>Spokeswoman Ella Colley says: "This research shows that there is an undeniable consumer demand for more sustainable travel options like e-scooters and many people want the UK laws to catch up with the rest of the world."</p>

      <p>"As e-scooters offer people a desirable and convenient alternative to driving for short journeys, they could be part of our clean air solution.</p>

      <p>"So I am keen to help Government gather the data it needs to legislate responsibly for this new mode of transport, and do so quickly."</p>
      <p>Almost 40% of those surveyed said they agreed e-scooters should be legalised for use beyond private land in the UK.</p>
