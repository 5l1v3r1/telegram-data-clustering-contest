      <h1>Britain's third richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe wants to build luxury summer house on stilts at his £6m mansion</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:12:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>Britain's third richest man, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cycling/2019/03/18/sir-jim-ratcliffe-billionaire-ready-lead-team-skys-latest-charge/">Sir Jim Ratcliffe</a>, has proposed building a luxury summer house at his £6m holiday home on stilts so it doesn't get flooded.</p>
      <p>The petrochemicals magnate, who is worth an estimated £18bn, wants to erect the residence in the gardens of his sprawling estate in New Forest National Park.</p>
      <p>His neighbours are unhappy with the plan to give him perfect views of the Hampshire coast, saying it will blight the landscape and "stick out like a sore thumb".</p>
      <p>They also argued that the planning application should be rejected because the property could be deluged with water as the area is prone to flooding.</p>
      <p>But Sir Jim, 67, has seemingly sidestepped that issue by pledging to position the house, made from oak and cedar shingles, on a raised platform supported by wooden posts so it doesn't get inundated.</p>
      <p>Planning documents he has submitted read: "An ideal spot for relaxation, the isolated setting and scenic views are key qualities to the design of the summer house.</p>
      <p>"The semi-open spaces intend to encourage occupants to enjoy the advantages of the great outdoors and living in the New Forest National Park, an area renowned for its picturesque countryside.</p>
      <p>"Lifting the building floor height addresses the site's susceptibility to rising flood levels as a result of climate change."</p>
      <p>The billionaire, who owns chemicals giant Ineos, previously fought a six-year battle with neighbours, planning authorities and conservationists to get his £6m mansion built.</p>
      <p>After rejecting his application five times, national park planners eventually granted approval on the sixth attempt and builders began work last year.</p>
      <p>Sir Jim, who <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/08/08/britains-wealthiest-man-sir-jim-ratcliffe-leaves-uk-move-monaco/">relocated to Monaco in February</a>, has also submitted another planning application for his New Forest estate.</p>
      <p>He hopes to turn a derelict "tin cottage", which he bought for £2.5m in 2006, into a three-bedroom home to house a "permanent guardian" who would be responsible for maintaining the grounds.</p>
      <p>It would include an open plan kitchen and dining area, two bathrooms, a lounge area and a cloakroom.</p>
      <p>The entrepreneur, who grew up on a council estate in Greater Manchester, got a 2:1 degree in chemical engineering at the University of Birmingham.</p>
      <p>He only started his first business weeks before his 40th birthday and founded Ineos aged 45 in 1998.  </p>
      <p>The company's annual turnover is about £45 billion and it employs more than 18,500 people at 181 sites across 22 countries.</p>
      <p>Its products are, among many other things, used to clean water, make toothpaste, manufacture antibiotics, insulate homes and package food.  </p>
      <p>Sir Jim saw his wealth increase by an astonishing £15.3 billion between 2017 and 2018.  </p>
      <p>He married his first wife Amanda Townson in 1985. The pair, who have two sons, divorced in 1995. He has a daughter with his second wife Alicia.</p>
