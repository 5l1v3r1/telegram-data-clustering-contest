      <h1>What Odell Beckham said to Mike Tomlin after taunting him with yawn</h1>

      <p>Odell Beckham made sure to clap back at Steelers coach Mike Tomlin where it hurt the most, on the field.</p>
      <p>Back in August, Tomlin <a href="https://twitter.com/JFowlerESPN/status/1157316016638255104">made a yawning gesture</a> when ESPN asked him about facing Beckham twice a year after the wide receiver was traded from the Giants to the Browns. But it was Beckham who got the last yawn after a 42-yard catch last Thursday as he returned the favor.</p>
      <p>One yawn wasn’t enough, as Beckham and fellow Browns receiver Jarvis Landry celebrated the latter’s 1-yard touchdown catch with a joint fake yawn in the end zone. Beckham said it was all in good fun and even got to have a word with Tomlin following an incomplete catch in front of the Steelers bench late in the game.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘You disrespected me,’” Beckham <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/odell-beckham-jr-tells-mike-tomlin-you-disrespected-me-with-the-yawn-but-then-he-put-the-story-to-bed.html">told Cleveland.com</a>. “I said, ‘You know who I am.’ And he said, ‘I know who you are. That’s why we’re doubling you all game,’ and this and that.</p>

      <p>“We were just talking,” he added. “There’s never been no beef with me and no coach. We were just talking s—.”</p>
      <p>Beckham even said he wasn’t worried about being hit with a taunting penalty for anything he did or said to Tomlin, though he quickly reconsidered.</p>
      <p>“For me? Maybe, you know?” Beckham said.</p>
