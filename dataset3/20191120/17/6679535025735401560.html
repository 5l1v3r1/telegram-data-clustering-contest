      <h2>Split in Muslim votes may badly impact Trinamool as it did Congress in Assam</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:16:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Suvojit-Bagchi-429/" target="_blank">Suvojit Bagchi</a></address>
      <p>In the last 72 hours, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had twice warned Hyderabad-based Asaduddin Owaisi of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM), asking him to refrain from contesting in the Bengal polls, without naming him. On Wednesday, she was more categorical than on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Those who are coming from outside with other interests would not be allowed to hold indoor meetings [with administrators]. [The] Hyderabad party is BJP’s agent,” she told a meeting of the administrators. “He asked the Muslims not to ‘associate with extremism’. They [AIMIM] are like mosquitoes of dengue, will sting and fly away. We will take care of the interests of the minorities,” she said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The AIMIM chief on Tuesday said, “If Mamata Banerjee wants a fight, [we] will give it to her” playing the ball back to Ms. Banerjee’s court. While — as of now — there is no confirmation about the AIMIM’s poll plans in Bengal, a split in Muslim votes may severely trouble the Trinamool Congress [TMC] like the Congress in the 2016 Assembly polls in Assam. In Assam, the predominantly Muslim All India United Democratic Front of Assam polled 13% of Bengali Muslim votes facilitating the BJP’s victory.</p>
      <p>The other factor is even more ominous for the TMC. A recent study on Muslim employment indicates that the number is not increasing in government jobs, despite the Opposition’s repeated allegation of Muslim appeasement against the TMC.</p>
      <p>In the Kolkata Municipal Corporation [KMC] for example the number of Muslim employees has dropped from 1,555 in 2008 to 1,126 in 2019. As per the latest available government data [2015], the percentage of Muslims in the State government jobs is 5.73, while their population is about six times more. Muslims are engaged in 15.61 and 11.09% jobs respectively in Murshidabad and Malda, districts with over 50% Muslim population.</p>
      <p>The information was published, for the first time, by researcher Sabir Ahamed, examining a decades’ data collected from the National Sample Survey [NSS], Administrative Staff Census, reports of Pratichi Institute, founded by Prof. Amartya Sen, and Social Network for Assistance to People. The data, also collected using RTI, was presented at a two-day symposium on Bengali Muslims earlier this week, hosted by the Bengali Academia for Social Empowerment, a social organisation.</p>
      <p>However, while the actual number dropped, the percentage increased marginally in a few cases, like in the case of the KMC. In 2008, their percentage in the KMC jobs was 4.5 whereas in 2019 it is 5.2.</p>
      <p>Explaining the phenomenon, Mr. Ahamed said: “Marginal improvement [in percentage] is partly because of OBC reservation for Muslims” in 2010. “There are some improvements in enrolment in education, yet it has not translated in their participation in the formal job sector,” Mr. Ahamed told <i>The Hindu</i>.</p>
      <p>Besides, “slow and cumbersome” OBC registration process and “abysmally low participation in ICDS workforce, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, school teachers” were cited as other reasons for low employment in the paper.</p>
      <p>In the Kolkata police, both the actual number and the percentage has increased. From 2,267 [9.13%] in 2008, it has increased marginally in 2019. But in the Directorate of West Bengal Police, it is very poor: against 134 Hindus only three Muslims are employed.</p>
