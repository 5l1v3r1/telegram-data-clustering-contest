        <b>Jimmy Kimmel hilariously re-imagines "The Irishman" as part of the Marvel universe</b>
      </p>
      <p>Martin Scorsese stopped by "Jimmy Kimmel Live" this week ahead of the much-anticipated release of "The Irishman" on Netflix, but Kimmel was keen to settle the controversy that's surrounding the director's recent comments about Marvel films.</p>

      <p>When asked about Marvel films in <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/martin-scorsese-marvel-movies-not-cinema-theme-parks-1202178747/">an interview</a> with Empire magazine, Scorsese said: “I don’t see them. I tried, you know? But that’s not cinema.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”</p>
      <p>The Oscar-winning director later clarified his response with an op-ed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html">in The New York Times</a>.</p>

      <p>In his opening bit on November 18, Kimmel put settled the drama once and for all.</p>
      <p> “The one thing I hate is to see people upset," Kimmel said, "and that’s why I’m pleased to announce, to bring you, the world premiere trailer for the first-ever collaboration between Marvel and Martin Scorsese.”</p>
      <p>The spoof trailer sees “The Avengers,” “Iron Man,” and “The Hulk” all (hilariously) merged into the trailer for “The Irishman.”</p>
      <p>“Problem solved,” says Kimmel after the trailer.</p>
