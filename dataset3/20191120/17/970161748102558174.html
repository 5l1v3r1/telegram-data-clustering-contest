      <p>Jane McDonald has sent a video message of support to her number on fan <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts.</p>
      <p>Adele raised some eyebrows on I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! when she chose a framed picture of Jane as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>Her camp mates were so baffled that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-clash-as-he-mocks-jane-mcdonalds-legacy-thats-prejudice-11183514/">she even clashed with Roman Kemp over it.</a></p>

      <p>But Adele is about to have the last laugh as Jane has recorded a supportive message during a break in filming her new series of Jane &amp; Friends in Manchester.</p>
      <p>The Loose Women star joked that she also carries around a framed picture of Adele to keep her company.</p>
      <p>Stood in the audience, Jane said: ‘I would like to wish Adele all the best in the jungle. I carry a picture of you at all times my darling. Me and my friends would like to wish you the very best of luck. Good luck Adele!’.</p>
      <p>Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness previously cleared up the Jane ‘obsession’, explaining that she chose the photo because<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/"> other luxury items had already been chosen</a> by other camp mates.</p>

      <p>On Instagram she said: ‘The brief was “something to make you happy” so she chose something that never fails to cheer her up and something that reminds her of early morning Radio 1 listeners – it’s a bit of a long running feature on Adele’s show, when they’re having a bit of a slump and feeling down a listener will request “a bit of Jane” to get them through the day.</p>
      <p>‘I do have to say that most of her decisions are made at 2am when she gets up for her show, most things make perfect sense as that time.’</p>
      <p>However ex I’m A Celebrity star John Barrowman, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebritys-john-barrowman-accuses-adele-roberts-using-jane-mcdonald-get-votes-certain-community-11185090/">accused the DJ of using Jane for ‘votes’.</a></p>

      <p>Referring to Adele’s spat with Roman about the picture, he said on Extra Camp: ‘She has been caught out a little bit because she used the word prejudice, and he was just a young man asking a question.</p>
      <p>‘If you brought a picture of Jane McDonald on you should probably know the songs she sang.</p>
      <p>‘She probably brought it on to get a vote from a certain community and it’s all backfired on her a little bit, I think you are seeing her true colours right now.’</p>
