      <h2>Once a critic of Hindutva politics, the former JD(S) State chief is making an ideological shift as BJP candidate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:18:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Laiqh-A-Khan-795/" target="_blank">Laiqh A. Khan</a></address>
      <p>Former Minister A.H. Vishwanath’s return to the electoral fray, now as a BJP candidate in the byelections to Assembly from Hunsur in Mysuru district, represents the political gamble the veteran politician has taken by resigning as JD(S) MLA in an effort to chart out a new political course in the saffron party.</p>
      <p>Identified as a key figure in the resignation drama of 17 coalition MLAs in July this year, which led to the fall of the H D Kumaraswamy-led government, Mr. Vishwanath had a tough time not only securing the Supreme Court’s nod to contest the bypolls, but also fending off charges levelled by his political adversaries that he had accepted monetary benefits for switching sides.</p>
      <h3>Tough challenge</h3>
      <p>But, the bigger challenge before him now is to secure a stamp of approval from the people of Hunsur on his political moves since they elected him in 2018. For, his actions contributed to the installation of a BJP government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, while bringing down the Congress-JD(S) coalition.</p>
      <p>During the Assembly elections in May 2018, Mr. Vishwanath won as a JD(S) candidate polling 91,667 votes. But, the margin of victory was less than 8,000 votes as Congress candidate H.P. Manjunath, who had incidentally won in the 2008 and 2013 Assembly elections, came a close second securing 83,092 votes. J.S. Ramesh Kumar of the BJP had polled just 6,406.</p>
      <p>The Congress’ strength in the region came to the fore even during the subsequent Lok Sabha elections earlier this year when the party established a lead over BJP in Hunsur.</p>
      <p>But, the BJP, which is now in power both at the Centre and in the State, is no pushover in Hunsur. The party, which has a good organisational network and the support of frontal organisations, won in Hunsur Assembly twice earlier — C.H. Vijayshankar in 1994 and V. Pappanna in 1999.</p>
      <p>Amid the shaping of a keen electoral battle between the Congress and the BJP in the constituency, the JD(S) has also queered the electoral pitch with Mr. Kumaraswamy clarifying that their entry into the fray is not merely to defeat Mr. Vishwanath, who ditched the party that decorated him with post of State president, but to retain the Assembly segment.</p>
      <p>However, the party has fielded the lesser-known Mr. Somashekar as its candidate. But, Hunsur is also home to a substantial Vokkaliga population that displays an affinity to the JD(S), which has won the seat twice so far — G.T. Deve Gowda in 2004 and Mr. Vishwanath in 2018.</p>
      <h3>Not taking it lightly</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Vishwanath, for whom the stakes are quite high, is not taking the electoral challenge lightly. Once a strong critic of Hindutva politics, Mr. Vishwanath, in his new saffron avatar, is trying to justify his ideological shift.</p>
      <p>He is drawing a political parallel between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his political mentor the late Chief Minister D. Devaraj Urs for their “casteless” background. He has come out with a “pre-poll promise” of carving out a new district named after Urs with Hunsur as the headquarters. However, it remains to be seen if the people of Hunsur buy this narrative.</p>
