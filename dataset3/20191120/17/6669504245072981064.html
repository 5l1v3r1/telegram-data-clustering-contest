      <p>A man charged with first-degree murder following the fatal shooting of a 78-year-old parishioner in a Salmon Arm church in April is now facing a further charge of arson.</p>
      <p>One month before Gordon Parmenter was fatally shot during a service at the Salmon Arm Church of Christ on April 14, his family home was damaged by fire.</p>
      <p><a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/first-degree-murder-charge-for-25-year-old-who-allegedly-shot-senior-in-church/it61387">Matrix Savage Gathergood was charged with the murder of Parmenter </a>following the shooting and now faces another charge of arson in relation to an inhabited property. Court records show arson took place Mar. 14, the same day Parmenter's property was ravaged by fire.</p>
      <p>According to eyewitnesses, Gathergood entered the church in Salmon Arm with a rifle and shot Parmenter and another man, before parishioners wrestled him to the ground and seized his rifle. Parmenter was pronounced dead at the scene while the other man was taken to hospital in a stable condition. The 25-year-old was also charged with aggravated assault and having his face masked following the shooting.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://ca.gofundme.com/f/parmenter-house-fire-recovery-fund">GoFundMe page</a> set up after the <a href="https://infotel.ca/newsitem/donations-pour-in-for-widow-of-salmon-arm-shooting-victim/it61434">Parmenter's home was damaged by fire was turned into a memorial page</a>, which has received almost $25,000 in donations. The page says funds will go towards Gordon Parmenter's wife, Peggy, who was living in temporary accommodation following the fire.</p>
      <p>Gathergood is due back in court Dec. 3.</p>
