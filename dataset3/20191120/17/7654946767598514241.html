      <p>An Oklahoma woman flashed a huge grin for her mugshot — despite facing serious criminal charges for stabbing her husband to death, officials said.</p>
      <p>Shanda Johnson-Williams, 48, was arrested Tuesday in connection with the murder of her husband Jamie Williams in Fort Towson, according to Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.</p>
      <p>Deputies were called to the couple’s home Sunday after the husband was found unconscious, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The medical examiner determined his death was the result of a stabbing wound, officials said.</p>
      <p>Authorities didn’t release details about the circumstances surrounding his death.</p>
      <p>Johnson-Williams was booked in to Choctaw County Jail, where she faces a charge of first-degree murder, officials said. Her bond will be set at her arraignment.</p>
