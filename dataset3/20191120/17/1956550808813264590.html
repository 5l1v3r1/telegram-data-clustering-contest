      <h2>The star talks to Time Out Dubai ahead of Dubai’s DP World Tour Championships</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:10:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:10</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Mathieson</a></address>
      <p>One of the most exciting <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing">golf</a> tournaments in Dubai, the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing/sport/423570-massive-dhs293m-prize-fund-up-for-grabs-at-golfs-dp-world-tour-championship">DP World Tour Championship</a>, kicks off tomorrow (Thursday November 21) at Jumeirah Golf Estates.<br/><br/>But who will win this year? <i>Time Out Dubai</i> caught up with <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing/sport/398714-the-best-five-golf-courses-in-dubai">top golfer</a> Ian Poulter, a two-time runner up of the famous event, ahead of the tournament.<br/><br/>Poulter is targeting a first win since the 2017 Houston Open and he says it would mean a lot to win.<br/><br/>“I’ve been <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sport-wellbeing/sport/398714-the-best-five-golf-courses-in-dubai">playing golf</a> in the UAE for about 20 years and the landscape has changed hugely. It’s grown as a sport and is a far more inclusive game now,” Poulter, who is an ambassador for DP World and is tasked with shaping the future of the sport, tells Time Out.<br/><br/>“There’s more global interest with kids in golf now – there are more short courses and more forward tee positions for younger players. In the UAE and around the world there are more and more juniors getting involved.”<br/><br/>And this could increase more when <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/sportandoutdoor/news/80510-topgolf-is-coming-to-dubais-emirates-golf-club">Top Golf</a>, a golf, sports bar and party venue, opens at Emirates Golf Club next year.<br/><br/>“That should be really exciting,” adds Poulter. “I often take my kids to the ones in the States – even for people who don’t play there’s a wider social aspect and a fun atmosphere.”<br/><br/>The Ryder Cup star has fond memories of the European Tour’s finale and has only missed one edition of the World Tour Championship since its inception (when he was injured in 2016), while his two runner-up finishes came in 2010 and 2013.<br/><br/>More than 65,000 spectators are expected over the tournament – and if you haven’t visited before Poulter says a trip to the DP World Tour Championship should be on your list, whether you love sport or not.<br/><br/>“It’s one of the best tournaments in the world, we love coming out to Dubai as players,” he says. “It’s very well supported by spectators too, and it’s a fantastic course. From a fan’s perspective there’s loads to do and the hospitality is great. Plus nothing beats the atmosphere of a live sports event.<br/><br/>“Who should you watch out for? Rory [McIlory] is in great form, Matthew [Fitzpatrick], too. There are a number of great chances. It’s the best 50 players in Europe so it’s going to be exciting.”<br/><br/>And while Poulter’s here you may well see him shooting down a slide or too at Aquaventure. “I’m coming with my family, so as well as practising I’ll be spending some quality family time – visiting some waterparks and checking out some of the amazing restaurants that are in Dubai.”<br/><br/>Fancy checking it out?
