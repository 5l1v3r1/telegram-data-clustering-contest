      <p>Chrissy Teigen and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/John-Legend">John Legend</a> have their own way of expressing their love for each other, and that love language involves <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/chrissy-teigen-and-john-legend-on-ellen-degeneres-show-video-46904945"><i>a lot</i> of jokes and pranks</a>. During an interview on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/latest/The-Kelly-Clarkson-Show"><b>The Kelly Clarkson Show</b></a> on Tuesday, Chrissy joked that her husband has no emotions, which is why he has no trouble balancing his work on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/The-Voice"><b>The Voice</b></a> with his singing career. "He has no personality . . . no emotions," she said. Yeah, she was trying to say her husband works well under pressure, but her phrasing has me laughing harder than Chrissy herself.</p>
      <p>Chrissy went on to congratulate her husband on being recognized as <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/john-legend-people-sexiest-man-alive-46892957"><b>People</b>'s Sexiest Man Alive</a>. "It takes a lot to be an all-encompassing sexy man . . . It's about time," she said. Watch the full video here to see what else Chrissy had to say about her husband's magazine cover, keeping John on his toes, and what it felt like to win a Baby 2 Baby Giving Tree Award.</p>
