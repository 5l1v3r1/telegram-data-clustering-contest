        <b>International week is over! Time to look forward to the weekend match…and the January transfer window, obviously.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Training ground taking shape</h3>
      <p>Looks like we’re definitely in our final months at Melwood—the redevelopment at Kirkby is coming along splendidly and Liverpool should be there for next season.</p>
      <p>Today we have some pretty incredible (and exciting!) <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/new-images-show-scale-of-liverpools-new-training-ground-and-the-progress-being-made/">new images of the Kirkby site</a>, the new building and the pitches.</p>
      <p>There’s also some intriguing details released over the youth teams and first team, how they’ll work together…and where they won’t.</p>
      <p>Definitely worth a close look, including a video.</p>
      <h3>Big end to international week</h3>

      <p>Take a bow, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a>.</p>
      <p>As if his recent strike record at international level hadn’t been impressive enough, he only went and banged in a hat-trick last night on his first-ever start as Netherlands captain, didn’t he?</p>
      <p>Magnificent stuff and great to have him in such good form, as well as showing his undoubted leadership prowess—you can <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/2019/11/gini-wijnaldum-enjoys-incredible-night-with-hat-trick-as-netherlands-captain/">watch the goals right here</a>.</p>

      <p>Back at Melwood, meanwhile, attentions are turning toward the return of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> football, with the Reds facing Palace on Saturday.</p>

      <h3>Liverpool dominate ESPN awards</h3>

      <p>Heads up: the Reds are really good. So good, in fact, that we’ve scooped another bunch of media awards—this time, the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog-espn-fc-united/story/3990866/espn-fc-100-liverpoolman-city-dominate-our-ranking-of-worlds-best-soccer-players">ESPN 100</a>.</p>
      <p>As you can probably guess, that’s their writers’ ranking of the top 100 players and managers in world football, broken down into groups of 10 in each position or role.</p>
      <p>And the Reds take home a whole load of first-place finishes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/trent-alexander-arnold/">Trent Alexander-Arnold</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/virgil-van-dijk/">Virgil van Dijk</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> all take top spot in their respective roles, while the likes of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/mohamed-salah/">Mo Salah</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/sadio-mane/">Sadio Mane</a> (and others!) all feature high in their areas of the pitch, too.</p>

      <h3>Stupid comparison of the day</h3>
      <p>There comes a time when all ageing folk simply find themselves out of touch with the way of the world, with the accepted way of talking, with the words and phrases they choose to use.</p>
      <p>Today, that day came for Harry Redknapp.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/harry-redknapp-backs-mauricio-pochettino-20922010">Speaking</a> on a radio show, the ex-Spurs boss suggested that <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/arsenal">Arsenal</a> should take Mauricio Pochettino and the fans would love him as long as he won—suggesting anyone is fine as long as they win:</p>
      <p>“If you go in there and start winning football matches, they would have taken Saddam Hussein in there when he was about, the fans don’t give a monkey’s! If you start winning every week, they’re singing ‘there’s only one Saddam’.”</p>
      <h3>Tweets of the day</h3>

      <h3>What we’re reading</h3>
      <p>Obviously, we need a more in-depth look at the Spurs circus; this from <i>the Athletic</i> and a trio of writers <a href="https://theathletic.com/1388073/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoint-mourinho-after-pochettino-sulked-his-way-to-the-sack/">discusses how Pochettino “sulked his way to the sack”</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, to close out the international break, BBC Sport have a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50437741">wide-ranging discussion over whether Euro 2020</a> will be one of the most exciting tournaments of recent times.</p>
      <h3>Worth watching tonight</h3>
      <p>A game for those interested in Liverpool’s youth teams: our <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> International Cup group contains Wolves, Athletic Club and Paris Saint-Germain, with the Reds’ U23s starting their games in December.</p>
      <p>Tonight it’s Wolves and PSG meeting at 7pm.</p>
