      <h1>50 Celebrity Couples You Forgot Were Couples</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:21:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:21</time> by <a rel="author">Maggie Maloney, Ruby Buddemeyer, Krystyna Chávez and Charlotte Chilton</a></address>
      <p>Most people in Hollywood are all about the attention. Whether it's good press or bad press, it's press. However, these couples prefer to keep their PDA to a minimum, so much so we...kinda forgot about them? And that's not a bad thing. Here, a few—okay, 50—couples who would rather keep things off Instagram and heat things up IRL instead. By how in love they all are, something is clearly working.</p>

      <h3>Diane Kruger, 43, and Norman Reedus, 50</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>Kruger and Reedus met in 2015 on the set of the indie film, <i>Sky</i>. Throughout the following months rumors swirled about the duo, made even more salacious as Kruger had just broken up with her boyfriend of 10 years, Joshua Jackson. They didn't make their red carpet debut until the 2018 Golden Globes.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're together: </b>Between the laid-back attitude of these famous actors and the relentless speculation of whether they were together at the beginning of their relationship, it's easy to forget that they are, indeed, an item. In November 2018, the couple became parents to a baby girl, but in the interest of privacy, have not revealed any details.</p>

      <h3>Gwyneth Paltrow, 47, and Brad Falchuk, 48</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>The couple met in 2014 on the set of <i>Glee—</i>she was a guest star, he was the show's co-creator—and began dating shortly after in April of that year.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're</b><b> together: </b>The notoriously private couple didn't reveal their relationship until they'd been dating for well over a year. Both were previously married, so they took their time to tie the knot and now have a unique living situation where they're only together four nights a week. Despite their unconventional arrangement, they seem to be doing well according to their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWLIUUqFB4U/?utm_source=ig_embed">Instagram snaps</a>.</p>

      <h3>Lili Reinhart, 23, and Cole Sprouse, 27</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>No one knows exactly, because the costars are notoriously private about their relationship. The actors stated previously that they would never officially confirm or deny their private relationship. So when they arrived on the red carpet at the 2018 Met Gala, fans just about lost it.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Despite their poetic words to one another on Instagram, Reinhart and Sprouse are able to keep a low profile since they film <i>Riverdale</i> in Canada. There were rumors these two broke up earlier this year, but they have confirmed that they are, indeed, together.</p>

      <h3>Taran Killam, 37, and Cobie Smulders, 37</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>14 years. That's an achievement in Hollywood. The two met at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AevuqJkjU_g">mutual friend's birthday party</a> when they were just 22 years old.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Both famous in their own right—Smulders starred on <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> and Killam is known for his run on <i>Saturday Night Live—</i>the actors prefer to keep their personal lives out of the spotlight. Since saying "I do" in 2012, they've welcomed two children together.</p>

      <h3>Taraji P. Henson, 49, and Kelvin Hayden, 36</h3>
      <p><b>How long they’ve been together: </b>They started dating in 2015 and Hayden popped the question on Mother’s Day 2018. Please defer to Henson’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiwgTbxAKRO/?utm_source=ig_embed">engagement announcement</a> (spoiler alert: Hayden’s gift-game is strong).</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Henson rarely shares information about her private life, but she posts the occasional (super-cute) Instagram of her fiancé (an NFL star). If you don’t follow her on the ‘gram, odds are you aren’t in the know.</p>

      <h3>Taylor Swift, 29, and Joe Alwyn, 28</h3>
      <p><b>How long they have been together:</b> The couple reportedly met back in October of 2016, but did not confirm their relationship until May of 2017. And it wasn't until June that they were photographed together. In August of 2019 rumors started to circulate the pair may be <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a13561434/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-relationship-timeline/">engaged</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forget they're together:</b> They literally don't want anyone to know their business. And honestly, can you blame them? Swift has been through it! It makes complete sense she has decided to keep this relationship under wraps. Seriously guys, there are only like two photos of them together at events.</p>

      <h3>Meryl Streep, 70, and Don Gummer, 72</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>Streep stayed with Gummer, a friend of her brother's, in his New York apartment while filming <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i>. The actress had just lost her boyfriend to lung cancer and turned to the sculptor for support. After a brief courtship, Streep and Gummer got married in September 1978. More than 40 years later, the couple is still going strong.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forget they're <b>together</b>: </b>Although she's renowned for her film career, Streep likes to keep her private life out of the public eye. The couple leads a relatively normal life on their estate in Connecticut and are the parents of three daughters.</p>

      <h3>Alicia Vikander, 31, and Michael Fassbender, 42</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>After falling in love on the set of their film <i>The Light Between Two Oceans</i> in 2014, the two A-list actors tied the knot in a secret ceremony in the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>They're one of the most elusive couples in Hollywood, making very few public appearances together and remaining tight-lipped about their relationship. "I think we've made a clear statement that we keep certain things just between us. It was very easy to unite, but that's quite personal," Fassbender told<a href="https://ew.com/article/2016/09/02/michael-fassbender-alicia-vikander-light-between-oceans/"> <i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>.</p>

      <h3>Harrison Ford, 77, and Calista Flockhart, 55</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>The actors met at the Golden Globe Awards in 2002 and have been together ever since. After getting engaged on Valentine's Day in 2009, the couple got married a year later. <br/><b><br/></b><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Despite a 22-year age gap, Ford and Flockhart seem to make it work thanks to their laid-back lifestyle and unwavering support for one another. Ford, who has children from his previous marriage, has taken on the role of father to Flockhart's 18-year-old son, Liam. "Harrison and Calista are all about family life. Their life before and after they got married is focused on Liam," an insider told <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/harrison-ford-plane-crash-inside-his-unshakable-marriage-to-calista-flockhart/">People</a>.</p>

      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>They confirmed they were dating in 2013 after meeting on the set of <i>The Oranges</i> in 2011. They married in a private ceremony in February 2014 and welcomed a baby girl in August 2015.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forget they're together: </b>The couple has kept their relationship under wraps on purpose. Both had dealt with public breakups before, she with Sebastian Stan in 2010 and Brody with Rachel Bilson in 2006.</p>

      <h3>Amanda Seyfried, 33, and Thomas Sadoski, 43</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>Although they fell in love on the set of <i>The Last Word </i>in 2016, Seyfried and Sadoski had previously worked together on Broadway while they were both in other relationships. "[He] never flirted, never disrespected his wife. That was another reason why I thought, later on, that I could marry him," Seyfried told <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525081&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.net-a-porter.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fporter%2Farticle-92b730d7ec3ab146%3Fcm_mmc%3DLinkshareUS-_-je6NUbpObpQ-_-Custom-_-LinkBuilder%26siteID%3Dje6NUbpObpQ-XtaNoNfqZvxprbxSs3OFqw%26VigLink%3DVigLink%26dclid%3DCjgKEAiAzanuBRCgyIvk8sKXwlQSJADylfoDANBkKum7W0DU5elkbOcCApqua76tMm9bWDX3_AwSEfD_BwE&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fcelebrity%2Fg3437%2Fcouples-you-forgot-were-couples%2F">Porter Magazine</a>. Now, married since 2017, the couple are parents to daughter Nina.</p>
      <p><b><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>:</b> </b>After some high-profile breakups, Seyfried and Sadoski prefer to keep their relationship as private as their wedding ceremony–which included a two-person ceremony, a Free People dress, and a reception at their neighborhood café.</p>

      <h3>Salma Hayek, 53, and François-Henri Pinault, 57</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>We know Hayek and Pinault met in 2006 at a charity gala in Venice and that they announced their pregnancy and engagement at the same time in 2007, but there isn't much more the couple is willing to share. "It's such a romantic, amazing story, but it is mine. I don't want to vulgarize it by making it into a story to make myself interesting," Hayek told <i><a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a26414988/salma-hayek-interview-april-2019/">Town and Country</a> </i>in 2019.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Hayek and Pinault are incredibly supportive of one another on the red carpet, but they like to create boundaries around their personal lives.</p>

      <h3>Sarah Paulson, 44, and Holland Taylor, 76</h3>
      <p><b>How long have they been together:</b> The pair started dating quietly in 2015. They had known each other for a long time and seen each other around the Warner Bros. set, but it wasn't until about 10 years after they met that the two <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xoK7FSz-0Q">united again</a>: Paulson responded to a tweet in which Taylor seemed down and the rest is history.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're together:</b> Paulson and Taylor are the epitome of under the radar! The two always support each other on the red carpet, but prefer to keep their private life to themselves.</p>

      <h3>Zoë Kravitz, 30, and Karl Glusman, 31</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together:</b> Kravitz and Glusman were introduced in 2016 by mutual friends. She was smitten from the start and the two have shared sweet love notes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BVDdv96g9ni/?utm_source=ig_embed">Instagram</a> that melt our hearts.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're together:</b> The pair is insanely low-key. We barely knew about they were thinking of tying the knot before they surprised everyone with a wedding <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a24427486/who-is-karl-glusman-zoe-kravtiz-engaged/">announcement</a> in May of 2019.</p>

      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>Since meeting on a blind date in 2002, Spiewak has been by <i>T</i><i>he </i><i>Big Bang Theory </i>star's side during his astronomical rise to fame. After 11 years and plenty of speculation, the two were married in 2017.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>The couple takes to Instagram with cute snaps for anniversaries and such, but Parsons avoids divulging too much about his personal life in interviews.</p>

      <h3>Helen Mirren, 74, and Taylor Hackford, 74</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together:</b> Mirren met her director husband, Hackford, when she was 38 years old. "I did very consciously choose my work over my relationships right up to the time that I met Taylor," Mirren told <i><a href="https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/movies-for-grownups/info-2016/helen-mirren-celebrity-interview.html">AARP Magazine</a></i>. The two married in 1997, 10 years after they started dating.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're a couple: </b>With such accolades as a Damed actress and an Academy Award-winning film director, Mirren and Hackford are the definition of a heavy-hitter Hollywood couple. Yet they are more than happy keeping a low profile.</p>

      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>The actress began dating the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> segment director in October 2017, but the two have managed to stay majorly under the radar.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Stone and McCary haven't made their red carpet debut together yet. Although their two year relationship has been seemingly going well—engagement rumors have been swirling recently—we may always be in the dark about their relationship.</p>

      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>The couple met in 2018 on the set of the Oscar-winning biopic, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody, </i>where they were in an on-screen relationship.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Although the couple shined throughout 2019's awards season, things seem to have settled for Malek and Boynton. They've since traded red carpet photo ops for casual New York City strolls, which seems to be more their speed.</p>

      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> The down-to-earth couple don’t usually flaunt their relationship in public—considering the fact that they started as co-stars, the two know how to keep it professional.</p>

      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>James and Smith started dating prior to their relative success in the United States (thanks to their roles on hit shows like <i>Downton Abbey </i>and <i>The Crown</i>). The pair tends to keep things between them hush hush, while leading a seemingly normal life together in London.</p>

      <h3>Rachel Brosnahan, 29, and Jason Ralph, 33</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>Although the stars have kept mum about how they met, Brosnahan and Ralph were first linked in 2015.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're <b>together</b>: </b>Brosnahan's profile has significantly grown with her success on <i>The</i> <i>Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, </i>so<i> </i>it wasn't surprising when reports began speculating that the longtime couple had tied the knot in 2018. What <i>was</i> surprising? That the couple had actually already been married for a long time—but they haven't revealed how long.</p>

      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Keys and Swiss are notoriously quiet about their personal life and have a knack for leaving us wanting much more (especially after cute Instagrams like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BiuVzJ2hyoU/?hl=en&amp;taken-by=therealswizzz">this</a>).</p>

It was like I found all my answers with him, not in him. I was finding my answers on my own,” she told <i>Fashion</i> magazine.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Saldana and Perego got married after a few weeks of dating—they kept their relationship so quiet that most people didn’t know about it until they had already said ‘I do.’</p>

You decide for yourself: with two beautifully thick Spanish accents, two Oscars, and two adorable children (we can only assume...the paparazzi has left the kids alone for the most part) between them, it's safe to say they qualify as <i>really</i> cute.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forget they're together: </b>After having her son, Leo, in 2011, Cruz, told <a href="http://www.vogue.com/865440/the-dream-life-of-penelope-cruz/">Vogue</a>: "I want my son—and my kids if I have more—to grow up in a way that is as anonymous as possible." Cruz and Bardem have taken this seriously: They welcomed a second child, daughter Luna, in 2013 to minimal fanfare.</p>

      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together: </b>Dunst is typically pretty open about her relationships (she ended her very-public, long-term relationship with Garret Hedlund in 2016), so her quiet romance with Plemons has come as a surprise.</p>

      <h3>Margot Robbie, 29, and Tom Ackerley, 29</h3>
      <p><b>How long they’ve been together:</b> The duo met on the set of <i>Suite Franchise</i> in 2013—Robbie was a supporting actress and Ackerley an assistant director. After moving from friends, to roommates, to an official couple, Margot and Ackerley wed in a secret ceremony in 2016. When asked about meeting Ackerley, Margot told <i>Vogue</i>, “We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, <i>Oh, he would never love me back. Don’t make it weird, Margot</i>…And then it happened, and I was like, <i>Of course we’re together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before</i>.”</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> One of the reasons Margot comes across as so cool and laid back is because, well, she really is that cool and laid back. The actress rarely posts photos with her producer husband, and they keep their red-carpet PDA to a minimum. (Though they look particularly cute here.)</p>

Fun fact: The bride was clad in a mustard-yellow suit and the best man was Josh Ostrovsky (a.k.a. The Fat Jew).</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Ratajkowski and Bear McClard got together fast—so much so that they were married before most people even knew they were an item.</p>

      <p><b>Why you forget they're together:</b> Diaz and Madden are a low-key couple only spotted doing similarly low-key things. They shy away from the red carpet and reserve any PDA for understated Instagram posts. Their wedding was so top-secret that it took place at their home in Beverly Hills.</p>

      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> They’re super-duper low profile when it comes to their relationship. Even though Mendes and Gosling have been together for years and have two children together, their public appearances are extremely rare (Mendes even skipped the 2017 Academy Awards—Gosling was nominated for Best Actor for <i>La La Land</i>—to stay at home with their girls, Esmeralda and Amada).</p>

      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Although Fisher and Cohen have been together 17 years, they keep their family life relatively quiet.

      <p><b>Why you forget they're together: </b>They have very few PDA-moments, but maybe that's because they're both so busy? Kushner, the son of real-estate mogul Charles Kushner and the younger brother of Ivanka Trump's hubby, Jared, is an Ivy League grad and the co-founder of Oscar Insurance.

Bosworth says they were careful to keep their relationship professional in the beginning, though. “'There are so many people that hook up on movies, and you wonder if that's real, so we didn't go there" she told <i>Marie Claire UK</i>. “I think we were both experienced to know that if this was the real deal, we could wait to see what would happen."</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Bosworth had a few high-profile relationships with celebrities like Alexander Skarsgård and Orlando Bloom, so her relationship with director Polish has seemed quiet in comparison.</p>

      <h3>Maya Rudolph, 47, and Paul Thomas Anderson, 49</h3>
      <p><b>How long they’ve been together:</b> Although they've never officially tied the knot (as far as we know), they’ve been together since 2001 and have four children.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Although the iconic actress-director duo has been together since the early aughts, they’re rarely seen in public together. Other than a few red carpet cameos, it’s difficult to find photos of Rudolph and Anderson.</p>

      <h3>Amber Tamblyn, 36, and David Cross, 55</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>They got engaged in August 2011 and married on October 6, 2012, but their first encounter was on a flight. Tamblyn, a fan of Cross, was staring at him until they changed seats to sit next to each other. The rest is history.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they're together:</b> Because the idea of Tibby Rollins from <i>The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants</i> and Tobias Fünke from <i>Arrested Development</i> together—married no less—seems unreal.</p>

      <h3>Carey Mulligan, 34, and Marcus Mumford, 32</h3>
      <p><b>How long they've been together: </b>They got engaged in August 2011 after five months of dating, followed by an April 2012 wedding. Fun fact: They met when they were pen pals as children and reconnected years later.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forget they're together:</b> Maybe it's their work ethic. Mulligan had the couple's first child in September 2016 and was on a press tour only five weeks later, with Mumford by her side but only behind the scenes. Since, Mulligan and Mumford have welcomed their second child.</p>

      <h3>Hilarie Burton, 37, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, 53</h3>
      <p><b>How long they’ve been together:</b> The two started dating in 2009 but didn’t make their red carpet debut until 2010 (which was after they welcomed their first child together).</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> Burton and Morgan don’t hide their relationship, but their equally low-key personalities have allowed their relationship to fly relatively under the radar. The couple, who lives on a farm in upstate New York, only recently tied the knot in an intimate, yet gushy, ceremony.</p>

      <h3>Joseph Gordon-Levitt, 38, and Tasha McCauley</h3>
      <p><b>How long they’ve been together:</b> Gordon-Levitt claimed he was off the market in 2013 and the couple were wed in a secret ceremony in 2014. They have two kids together.</p>
      <p><b>Why you forgot they’re together:</b> They’re basically the gold standard when it comes to discretion—Gordon-Levitt rarely (if ever) talks about his marriage to the businesswoman or their children with the press and has maintained his privacy for most of his career.</p>
