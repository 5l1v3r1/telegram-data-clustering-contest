      <p>The father of Feroze Khan, whose appointment at the Banaras Hindu University’s Sanskrit department has triggered a row, himself sings bhajans at temples and serves at a cow shelter.</p>
      <p>At a temple in the premises of Shree Ramdev Gaushala Chetanya Dham in Bagru, 35 km from here, Ramzan Khan on Wednesday participated in the aarti, sitting at a harmonium and singing a devotional song.</p>
      <p>He himself holds the shastri qualification in Sanskrit, composes religious songs and performs ‘gau sewa’ at the nearby cattle shed. At the same time, he visits the mosque and offers namaz.</p>
