      <h2>At 105, Bhageerathi Amma oldest equivalency course student</h2>

      <p>With her silver mane and frail body Bhageerathi Amma looks every day of her grand old age of 105. But that has not stopped the Thrikkaruva resident from pursuing her dream and becoming the oldest equivalency course student of the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority.</p>
      <p>She completed all the three papers of her Class 4 equivalency course, including Malayalam, Environment, and Mathematics, on Wednesday with the help of KSLMA resource persons and her youngest daughter Thankamani.</p>
      <p>The elderly woman had to leave school after Class III to take care of her younger siblings. Later, she never got any chance to continue her education due to her responsibilities as a wife and mother.</p>
      <p>And following her husband’s sudden demise she dedicated her life to raising her six children. Over the years she lost touch with letters and had to start from the scratch when she signed up for literacy classes.</p>
      <p>Resource persons S.N Shirley and K.B. Vasanthakumar offered her all the support while her 70-year-old daughter Thankamani kept encouraging her mother.</p>
      <h3>Sharp learner</h3>
      <p>“Amma is a sharp learner and despite her age, she picked up everything fast. Apart from the slight discomfort in walking, her health is perfectly fine. Her vision is also good and she doesn’t miss cricket matches on TV. Compared to others her age, she is quite active and loves singing,” says Mr. Vasanthakumar.</p>
      <p>Bhageerathi Amma is currently the matriarch of a large family that includes 16 grand kids and their children.</p>
