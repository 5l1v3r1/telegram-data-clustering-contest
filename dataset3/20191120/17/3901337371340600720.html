      <p>Lukaku joined United from Everton for a reported transfer fee of £75 million, plus £15 million in add-ons (R1.7 billion in total), in 2017, and went on to score 42 goals in 96 appearances for the club.</p>
      <p>The Belgium international was widely criticised by Red Devils supporters, however, and and former scout Steve Walsh, who was on the Toffees' books at the time, claims to have warned Mourinho about the current Inter Milan striker's attitude.</p>
      <p>"When Jose (Mourinho) signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, 'You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know'," Walsh told <i>The Athletic.</i></p>

      <p>"He said he could handle him (but) I don't think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do.</p>
      <p>"That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren't my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't have touched them. Because they are good players doesn't mean you are going to get a good team out of it."</p>
