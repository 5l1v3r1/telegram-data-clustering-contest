        <b>Christmas might not be coming early but Black Friday sure has, with NOW TV dropping deals already.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even though it falls on 29 November this year, the streaming service has announced that they’re offering discounts online and in-store ahead of the famous day of deals known as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/black-friday-2019-uk-deals-start-11066225/">Black Friday.</a></p>
      <p>Black Friday rolls around every year in the run-up to Christmas, promising fantastic offers on all manner of products the day after Americans celebrate Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Over time, retailers began to offer deals for longer periods of time instead of just on the day, and this year, NOW TV have done just that.</p>
