      <h1>ESPN Insider Offers Update On Myles Garrett Suspension Appeal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:14:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is in New York today, pleading his case to have his indefinite suspension reduced. With the process moving as quickly as it has, it looks like we’ll be getting an answer soon from the league.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Dianna Russini reported today that the decision on Garrett’s appeal could come soon, specifically, within a day or two.</p>
      <p>Russini’s sources explained that the league wants to “make a decision on this quickly.”</p>
      <p>Garrett made his case to the powers that be, and the NFL will be making their case today as well.</p>

      <p>The Browns pass rusher got involved in a scuffle with Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph in the waning seconds of last week’s game. That scuffle culminated in Garrett swinging a helmet at Rudolph and hitting him on the head.</p>
      <p>The NFL acted quickly, suspending him indefinitely the next day. Two other players were suspended for their role in the ensuing brawl, and other players are being fined.</p>
      <p>But it was Garrett’s action that has attracted the most attention. Some have called for him to be thrown out of the league, while others feel he was provoked by Rudolph.</p>
      <p>Regardless, we should get a lot more clarity on Garrett’s fate in the days to come.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
