      <p>Looks like Greta Thunberg has a doppelgänger.</p>
      <p>After a photo from 1898 resurfaced on Twitter, showing three children working at a gold mine on Dominion Creek in the Yukon Territory, fans of the young environmentalist are convinced she’s a “time traveller” as one of the children looks a lot like Thunberg.</p>
      <p>Despite their similar facial expression, the girl, who sits on the left of the photo, even wears a braid in her hair – 16-year-old Thunberg’s signature hairstyle.</p>

      <p>“So ‘Greta Thunberg’ is in a photo from 120 years ago, and it’s my new favourite conspiracy. Greta’s a time traveller, from the future, and she’s here to save us,” one Twitter user wrote.</p>
      <p>Another added, “That has to be Photoshopped surely, they’re identical.”</p>
      <p>The black-and-white picture is part of the University of Washington’s archives.</p>
