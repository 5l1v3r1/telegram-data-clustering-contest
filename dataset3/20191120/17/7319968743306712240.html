        <b>"Dirty Old Town" being sung by a Dublin bartender? Nothing better.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s a scene familiar to plenty of pub patrons - at the end of the night (and a feed of pints) someone is bound to begin an earnest attempt at singing a tune.</p>

      <p>Last week in Dublin, however, the bartender stepped up to bat when he broke out a guitar and offered a rousing rendition of the beloved tune “Dirty Old Town," an old song that was popularized by the likes of The Dubliners and The Pogues.</p>
      <p>Irish man Alain Ó Donaile captured The White House Pub's singing bartender on video and later shared it with Dublin Live.</p>
      <p>On Facebook, Ó Donaile said: “Now if this ain’t just your typical Irish pub...Ye just can’t beat it ! !”</p>

      <p>Shane the bartender told<a href="https://www.dublinlive.ie/news/dublin-news/dublin-barman-singing-pub-dirtyoldtown-17272032"> Dublin Live</a>: "If I knew I was being recorded, I would have stepped it up a gear!</p>
      <p>"I've played behind the bar a few times and it's been craic. On that particular night, it was a good customer's birthday and I brought up my good guitar to play some music for him.</p>
      <p>"There was also a local funeral on in the function room and a few people came into the bar and joined in on the sing-song.</p>
      <p>"I had my friend Ciaran Dunne playing the box 'Cajon' and I was glad to help give their relation a good send-off.”</p>
