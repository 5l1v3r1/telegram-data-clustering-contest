      <p>One in four ethnic minority voters are not registered to vote, because many either ‘don’t know they’re entitled to or don’t know how to register’.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Electoral Commission released data which showed that 25 per cent of black voters in Great Britain were not registered, along with 24 per cent of Asian voters and almost a third (31 per cent) of people from a mixed ethnicity background.</p>
      <p>This is compared to a 17 per cent average across the population.</p>
      <p>According to the Runnymede Trust, the UK’s leading race equalities think tank, this is down to two major factors.</p>
      <p>Commonwealth citizens who are entitled to vote not knowing they can do so and people from BAME backgrounds not knowing how to register.</p>
      <p>Deputy director at the Runnymede Trust, Dr Zubaida Haque, told Metro.co.uk: ‘If you’re from a Commonwealth country you can vote depending on your age and residency requirements’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Dr Haque added that many people from Commonwealth countries who have leave to enter or remain in the UK, can vote but are unaware of this.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘The additional problem is it’s all online, and if you’re computer illiterate this can be a problem.’</p>

      <p>Dr Haque also emphasised how many people thought that just because they were paying council tax, they would automatically be on the electoral register, which wasn’t the case.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘People can also register to vote if they have no fixed address’.</p>
      <p>Dr Haque called on local councils to ensure people were registered to vote and added that if the government wanted to increase the ‘integrity’ of the democratic process then the answer lay in ensuring those who were eligible to vote were on the electoral register.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Boris Johnson and the government say they want to bring in voter ID to increase the integrity of elections, if they want to increase the integrity of the electoral process, then they should be getting people to register to vote.’</p>
      <p>Craig Westwood, Director of Communications, Policy and Research at the Electoral Commission, said: ‘Everyone eligible to vote should be able to do so, but must be registered by Tuesday 26 November.</p>
      <p>‘It only takes five minutes to register to vote online – time that you might otherwise spend waiting for the kettle to boil or for a bus to arrive. So if you want to make sure your voice is heard, go online and register now.’</p>

      <p>The Runnymede Trust is working with Voice4Change England to increase voter registration before the 26 November deadline.</p>
      <h3>Who is eligible to vote on December 12?</h3>
      <p>British, Irish or qualifying Commonwealth citizens</p>
      <p>
        <b>What is a ‘qualifying’ Commonwealth citizen?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The definition of a ‘Commonwealth’ citizen includes citizens of British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories.</p>
      <p>There are <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/i-am-a/voter/which-elections-can-i-vote#detail">53 Commonwealth countries</a>.</p>
      <p>A ‘qualifying’ Commonwealth citizen is someone who has leave to enter or remain in the UK, or who doesn’t require that leave.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Age</b>
      </p>
