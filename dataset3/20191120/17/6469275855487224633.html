      <p>The business, which opened to the Preston public in February 2018, launched the initiative last Christmas as a way to give back to the city community.</p>
      <p>Manager Karen Shivers said: "We did it last year and it was a great success.</p>
      <p>"We thought it was something to put back into Preston city centre because we get trade all year round from the community.</p>
      <p>"A few of us came in. My dad was down visiting from Scotland and he came in as well. My husband too. We all just had a great day."</p>

      <p>"It was just nice to get the community together and a really massive event."</p>
      <p>Naomi couldn't put a number on just how many people helped, adding that they were busy all afternoon.</p>
      <p>"We had homeless people queued up down the street and also donations of Christmas bags for men and women so everybody got something to go away with," she added.</p>

      <p>"The police couldn't get out to us so we took them sandwiches.</p>
      <p>"We have to give something back; especially at this time of year."</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the business added that donations are also being accepted.</p>
      <p>They said: "If you'd like to either come along to spread some love or make a donation in the form of sanitary products or nice warm clothes feel free to drop them off at our Preston branch [at] 2 Orchard Street.</p>
      <p>"I'd like to thank you in anticipation of your kindness.</p>
      <p>"So from everybody at Roast Happy Christmas and have a fantastic New Year. Thank you for all of your support."</p>
