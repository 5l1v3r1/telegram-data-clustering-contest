      <h1>This Is Us Drops Some Major Twists in the Season 4 Midseason Finale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:00:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kelsie Gibson</a></address>
      <p><b><a href="http://www.popsugar.com/This-is-Us">This Is Us</a></b> has dropped yet another timeline on us, and it's a doozy. During the season four midseason finale, the series jumped forward to the Big Three's 40th birthday. Though only nine months has passed since the Pearson family had Thanksgiving dinner together, clearly a lot has changed. The biggest shocker is that Rebecca's health has gotten even worse since we last saw her.</p>
      <p>During the episode, we see Rebecca get lost, lose her phone, and eventually get escorted home by the police when she can't remember her son's phone number. While the audience is led to believe that the story is happening in present day, we later learn that it is actually a flash-forward to the Big Three's 40th birthday when she arrives at the family's cabin home. So, just what does the Pearson family look like nine months from now? Keep scrolling to see the biggest twists in the midseason finale.</p>
      <h3>Rebecca's Health Has Gotten Worse</h3>

      <p>It's clear that Rebecca is still having memory issues in the flash-forward. After getting escorted home by the police, we see Miguel try to comfort a visibly shaken Rebecca in the cabin. Though <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Does-Rebecca-Have-Alzheimer-Us-45989596">Mandy Moore has ruled out Rebecca having Alzheimer's</a>, it appears she might have dementia. It seems like the second half of this season will continue to connect the dots to <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/What-Happens-Flash-Forward-Us-45986822">the Rebecca we see in the season three finale</a>.</p>
      <h3>Kevin Is Engaged and Expecting a Child</h3>

      <p>After learning that Kevin is a father in the flash-forward during the season three finale, it appears he might be married as well. In the midseason finale, Kevin makes a comment to one of the police officers about <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/who-mother-kevin-son-on-this-is-us-45988593">his expectant fianc√©e</a>. Hmm, seeing that this is nine months after Thanksgiving, it's possible that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/is-cassidy-mother-kevin-child-on-this-is-us-46847649">those theories about Cassidy being the mother of his child could be true</a>, after all.</p>
      <h3>Randall and Kevin Are Not on Speaking Terms</h3>

      <p>Of course, one of the biggest shockers from the flash-forward is that Kevin and Randall are not on good terms. When Rebecca asks if Randall will be coming to the birthday gathering, Kevin bluntly reminds his mother that they are not speaking to each other. Say it isn't so!</p>
      <h3>Kate and Toby Might Be Divorced</h3>

      <p>A few eagle-eyed fans noticed that when Kate signs Rebecca's paperwork for the police officers, she writes her name as Kate Pearson instead of Kate Damon. It's also worth noting that Toby is visibly absent from the cabin during the flash-forward. Seeing that Kate and Toby are having marital issues in present day, it could be a big indicator that <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Do-Kate-Toby-Get-Divorced-Us-45316198">they are separated or possibly even divorced</a> by the time she turns 40.</p>
