      <p>In an effort to help users keep up to date with what’s happening around the world, Twitter is working towards developing a new feature called Categorized Topic list. This feature will show top tweets about topics you follow on Twitter.</p>

      <p>The company is working towards expanding the range of topics. As you can see in the above image, in the Hip-Hop and Rap category, you have Hip-Hop and Rap subcategory, under which you have a popular profile like that of Cardi B and Nicki Minaj.</p>
      <p>The social media giant is currently testing the feature, meaning that you’ll have to wait a while to use the feature.</p>
      <p>In related news, Twitter is <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-pwa-soon-to-have-a-reddit-like-conversation-tree-feature/">working on a Reddit-like conversation tree</a> to help users keep track of conversations easily.</p>
      <p>Twitter recently <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-ios-and-web-app-now-let-you-search-for-conversations-in-direct-messages/">rolled out the Twitter DM search feature to the Twitter iOS app and as well as to the Twitter web app</a>. With this feature, you’ll need to just type a couple of letters of the name of any individual or group and Twitter will display all the possible matchings, of which you will be able to pick the right one and resume the conversation.</p>
