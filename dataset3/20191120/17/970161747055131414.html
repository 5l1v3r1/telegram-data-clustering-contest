      <p>Wendy Williams has questioned <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>’s decision to ban his daughter North from wearing makeup despite letting her have a nose ring.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> recently revealed her hubby’s rule when it came to lipgloss and eyeliner, and confessed that it has caused fights among the famous family.</p>
      <p>However, it seems Wendy is still trying to get her head around the fact that the six-year-old is still allowed a nose piercing.</p>
      <p>When chatting on her show’s Hot Topics segment, the 55-year-old raised her woes.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘He doesn’t want his daughter wearing makeup, but she can wear a full-on nose ring? So, where are we going with this?’</p>

      <p>The comments came after North’s mum spoke to E! News about her current parenting drama.</p>

      <p>She told the publication: ‘North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she’s being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager.’</p>
      <p>The beauty mogul added: ‘It’s a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what’s best.</p>
      <p>‘I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realised we didn’t really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss.’</p>

      <p>However, it seems jewelry is a hit with the Gold Digger rapper, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/23/kim-kardashian-shares-cute-snap-north-6-rocking-nose-ring-seriously-fashion-10442424/">as North has been spotted on numerous occasions wearing a septum piercing.</a></p>
      <p>Which, we should point out has been confirmed fake by Kim K herself.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the only remark Kanye has made about his little one, as he also opened up on her wardrobe choices when chatting on Apple Music’s Beats 1.</p>
      <p>Here he spoke about his regrets of trying to dress up North like a pop star when she was younger.</p>
      <p>‘I was literally out there making [North] try to out dress Rihanna,’ the 42-year-old said.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think North should wear a crop top after I had her wear a slip dress when she was two years old. I think and feel differently now that I am a Christian.’</p>
