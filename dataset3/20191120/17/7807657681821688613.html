Both laptops are meant for business users with a wide selection of ports, thinner bezels, and Intel's latest 10th Gen processors.</p>
      <p>On the inside, each laptop can be equipped with up to an Intel Core i7 10th Gen processor. They're also available with up to 1TB of SSD storage and up to 16GB of RAM. You'll also get integrated Intel UHD graphics here, but there are no discrete graphics options.</p>
      <p>Each laptop sports Dolby Premium Audio certification and a 13-inch FHD display. For security, each includes a fingerprint reader as well.</p>
      <p>The ThinkPad L13, which is the more traditional laptop of the two, weighs in at 3.1 pounds and measures 17.6mm thick. Lenovo claims it can achieve up to 14 hours of battery life and can be rapidly charged to 80 percent in an hour. As for ports, you're looking at two USB 3.1 ports, two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, an audio jack, and a microSD card slot.</p>
      <p>The ThinkPad L13 Yoga, meanwhile, is a convertible laptop that measures 17.6mm thick and weighs a little more at 3.3 pounds. Lenovo claims the L13 Yoga can hit up to 12 hours of battery life with the same rapid charge capabilities as the base L13. You'll also get the same selection of ports as the L13 here.</p>
      <p>Both laptops are available to order now via Lenovo, though some configurations aren't quite available.</p>
