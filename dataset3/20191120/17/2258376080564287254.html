      <p>SASKATOON -- A toddler with a rare skin disease had a shipment of his medical supplies stolen from his front porch.</p>
      <p>Leo Leptich, who is nearly two years old, was born with epidermolysis bullosa, a rare and painful blistering skin disease.</p>
      <p>The incurable genetic disorder is often referred to as “butterfly skin." The condition leaves the entire body delicate and easily able to blister from <a href="https://www.debracanada.org/about/understanding-eb">even the slightest friction.</a></p>
      <p>The toddler relies on medical bandages to prevent painful cuts or blistering.</p>
      <p>But on Tuesday the bandages were stolen from his home in the Riversdale neighbourhood, according to the boy’s parents.</p>
      <p>"We came home and there was one box of bandages and brought it inside and thought that’s all that got delivered. But when I looked through them later, there was something obviously missing because there wasn’t a packing slip or anything," Leo’s father Adam Leptich said in an interview.</p>
      <p>"So I looked at my camera. To see people steal that kind of stuff, it’s heartbreaking."</p>

      <p>He shared footage from their doorbell camera on Facebook, in hopes of catching the thieves.</p>
      <p>"If anybody knows these ladies please pass their names on to the police," Leptich wrote.</p>
      <p>The video appears to show two people taking the boxes and loading them into a dark-coloured van.</p>
      <p>The Facebook post has been viewed more than 77,000 times.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the incident.</p>
