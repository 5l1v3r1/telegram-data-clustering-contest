      <h1>New Adidas x Star Wars Collab Is Out of This World</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:45:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:45</time> by <a rel="author">Gabrielle Hondorp</a></address>
      <p>The end is imminent for the mythological, space soap opera saga this December—which is why <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a22170339/best-adidas-shoes/">Adidas</a> is dropping these special edition trainers that you don’t want to miss. The brand is collaborating with Lucasfilm to bring you <i>Star Wars</i>-themed shoes to coincide with the release of <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i> (December 20). While there’s no guarantee they’ll bring you up to hyperspace speeds, they are designed on well-loved models—inspired by the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire—that will help you pound out the miles.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fultraboost-s-l-star-wars%2FFW0536.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa29857579%2Fadidas-star-wars-collab%2F">X-Wing Starfighter</a> blueprint covers the upper and sole of the UltraBoost S&amp;L, with colors of orange and gray to allude to the ship’s outer shell and artillery. The responsive shoe also has reflective, glow-in-the-dark detailing that will keep you visible on low-light runs. ”Stay on target” and “The force will be with you, always” sports the heel.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1576258&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fultraboost-19-star-wars-shoes%2FFW0525.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.runnersworld.com%2Fnews%2Fa29857579%2Fadidas-star-wars-collab%2F">Millennium Falcon</a> is seen on the <a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/gear/a25471864/adidas-ultraboost-19-shoe-review/">UltraBoost 19</a>—both fan favorites. With grey and blue coloring, reflective features, and metallic elements, you may question whether you are wearing space ships or running shoes. Inspiring your workout are phrases “Jump to lightspeed,” and “Never tell me the odds.”</p>
      <p>The final shoe, an Alphaedge 4D, is inspired by the infamous Death Star. It is mainly black, and sports a metallic upper and 3D-printed midsole meant to emulate the green lightsaber of Luke Skywalker. “That’s no moon” and “The power of the dark side” adorn the heels.</p>
      <p>The shoes will be available online and in select adidas stores on Thursday, November 21, and retail for $160 to $180 depending on the model.</p>
