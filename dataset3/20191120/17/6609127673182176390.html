      <p>Ashe was originally accused of swearing and "singing sectarian lyrics and lyrics in support of a terrorist organisation".</p>
      <p>Prosecutors did not specify any particular armed group in the statutory breach of the peace charge at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court.</p>
      <p>Ashe, who denied the offence, was found guilty of an amended charge of threatening or abusive behaviour likely to cause fear and alarm, aggravated by religious prejudice.</p>

      <p>Sheriff Shirley Foran cleared him of swearing and replaced the words "singing sectarian lyrics and lyrics in support of a terrorist organisation" with "repeatedly chanted lyrics in support of the UVF".</p>
      <p>The only lyric that could be identified clearly was "UVF", the court heard.</p>
      <p>Ashe, of Winchburgh, West Lothian, was fined £750.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Foran ruled the first offender should not be given a football banning order.</p>
