      <p>An airport worker managed to capture the extraordinary moment a bolt of lightning narrowly missed a passenger plane as it came in to land.</p>
      <p>Canterbury was bombarded by a six-hour hail storm and New Zealand’s South Island was hit by more than 1,500 lightning strikes.</p>
      <p>Huge golf ball-sized hail stones smashed windows, damaged roofs and dented vehicles, <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/114977667/wild-weather-hits-canterbury-for-second-time-in-three-days">Stuff</a> reported.</p>
      <p>It was the second storm in three days following a tornado which hit Christchurch on Monday.</p>
      <p>Passengers at the city’s airport were warned to remain in the terminal on Wednesday after multiple lightning strikes hit.</p>
      <p>Daniel Currie was on duty when he captured one bolt land perilously close behind an Emirates A380 aircraft as it touched down.</p>

      <p>‘It quite often stops the odd meeting at work as it comes by but today with the storm and the timing of the lightning it made for an awesome show,’ he told Stuff.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Airways New Zealand denied reports the control tower had also been hit by lightning, suggesting it might have struck a nearby car.</p>
      <p>She said aircraft were capable of landing at the airport, but were unable to take off because it was too dangerous to refuel.</p>
