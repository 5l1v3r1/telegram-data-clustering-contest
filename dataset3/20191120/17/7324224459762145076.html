      <p>Customers in Wolverhampton, Walsall, West Bromwich, Dudley and Lichfield will receive EE’s 5G coverage.</p>
      <p>EE was the first to launch 5G in the UK when six cities were switched on in May, including Birmingham.</p>
      <p>Since then it has been building its network on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>The announcement means people in the Black Country are among the first in the country to benefit from the latest mobile phone network technology.</p>
      <p>Marc Allera, CEO of BT’s consumer division, said: “Switching on 5G in more places is helping us deliver the best mobile experience to our customers, keeping them connected to the things that matter most.</p>
      <p>"RootMetrics’ early 5G testing shows that we are a long way ahead in terms of 5G performance, and our engineers are continuing to build new sites every day, on our journey to keeping our customers connected 100 per cent of the time.”</p>
      <p>Wendy Sycamore, BT Group regional lead for the Midlands, said: “It’s great to see the Black Country amongst the first locations in the UK to welcome 5G.</p>
      <p>"The new technology will enable a faster, more reliable mobile connection for both consumers and businesses in the area and is set to play a pivotal role in our lives.”</p>
      <p>Ninder Johal, board member of the Black Country LEP, said: “The arrival of 5G across the Black Country offers the latest technology and high-speed connectivity to many across the region, which will further foster innovation and partnerships.</p>
      <p>“We are hopeful that 5G will bring in a new era where everyone and everything is better connected. We believe 5G presents a number of opportunities to local businesses, students and local residents – allowing them to access the internet at much faster speeds, and enabling more innovation in our key employment sectors across the Black Country, including automotive, high value manufacturing, healthcare, and construction.”</p>
