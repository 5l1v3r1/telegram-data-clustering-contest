      <h1>Donald Trump’s Handwritten Notes on Impeachment Hearing Response Look Deranged</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:16:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.spin.com/author/maggie-serota/" target="_blank">Maggie Serota</a></address>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/11/asap-rocky-arrest-discussed-during-trump-impeachment-investigation/">Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland</a> was testifying before the Senate Intel Committee as part of <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/11/adam-schiff-pauses-impeachment-hearing-to-read-trump-live-tweets/">the ongoing impeachment hearing</a> on Wednesday, November 20, President Donald Trump was holding a press gaggle with reporters outside the White House.</p>
      <p>The president ostensibly held the presser to deny Sondland’s testimony <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sondland-was-there-a-quid-pro-quo-the-answer-is-yes/2019/11/20/34741e3c-0b92-11ea-8397-a955cd542d00_story.html">regarding a quid pro quo</a> in which U.S. diplomats were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment/senior-u-s-diplomat-says-he-followed-trumps-orders-on-pressuring-ukraine-idUSKBN1XU1BO">pressured to shake down the president of Ukraine</a> for oppo dirt <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/10/trump-nickelback-biden-ukraine-photograph-video/">on Hunter Biden</a>. However, the commander-in-chief got upstaged by his own handwritten notes, which were scrawled out in all caps with a black marker. They looked like he could’ve been <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/11/adam-schiff-pauses-impeachment-hearing-to-read-trump-live-tweets/">rage-tweeting about what he sees on cable news</a>, but without the internet connection. In other words, Trump has moved from digital to analog.</p>

      <p>One page of notes caught by cameras was particularly striking in that it misspelled Ukrainian President Zelensky’s name, and looked like the ravings of a lunatic.</p>
      <p>“I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO,” the large man <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/08/trump-bomb-hurricanes-axios-denial/">in charge of the country’s nuclear arsenal</a> wrote. “TELL ZELLINSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS THE FINAL WORD FROM THE PRES OF THE U.S.”</p>

      <p>Something tells us this won’t be the final word from the president.</p>
      <p>Egregious misspellings are par for the course in Trump’s written notes. In July 2019, the president was photographed holding absurdly large notes in which <a href="https://www.spin.com/2019/07/donald-trump-al-qaeda-spelling-note/">he spelled al-Qaeda “Alcaida.”</a> In 2018, he was <a href="https://www.spin.com/2018/07/trump-russia-notes-no-collusion/">spotted with a piece of paper </a>reminding him of his “No Collusion” talking point during the Mueller probe. In that case, Trump spelled it “COLUSION.”</p>
      <p>Bless this mess.</p>
