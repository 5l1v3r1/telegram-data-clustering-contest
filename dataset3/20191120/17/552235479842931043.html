      <h1>Colin Weir close to Partick Thistle takeover as lottery winner prepares to buy the Jags</h1>
      <h2>The 71-year-old is said to be on the verge of becoming the majority shareholder.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:06:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:06</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>Colin Weir is reported to be on the verge of completing a takeover for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/partick-thistle-fc">Partick Thistle</a> , having previously withdrawn his funding of the club.</p>
      <p>The 71-year-old won Â£161million on the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lottery">EuroMillions</a> in 2011, and has been an investor in the Jags ever since.</p>
      <p>However, he withdrew his support for the club after a boardroom shake-up which saw close ally Jacqui Low ousted.</p>
      <p>Now Weir is close to sealing a deal to become the majority shareholder.</p>

      <p>While he had previously lent his support to fan group Thistle For Ever, it's now believed that he will buy directly from outgoing shareholders including chairman David Beattie.</p>
      <p>As part of the deal Weir will also buy land at Firhill.</p>
      <p>The lottery winner has previously been involved in funding Partick Thistle's youth academy and helping the Jags to wipe out their debt.</p>
      <p>He had also committed to funding the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-championship">Championship</a> club's new training ground, but withdrew his support in August when Low was removed from the board.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if that plan will go ahead if and when Weir completes his takeover, and whether manager Ian McCall will be given funds to push for promotion to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> .</p>
