      <h1>Hearthstone Battlegrounds’ new heroes available now, but others have been removed</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft">Hearthstone</a> Battlegrounds may only be a few weeks old, but it’s already got new content coming to keep things fresh. New <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hearthstone/battlegrounds-heroes">Hearthstone Battlegrounds Heroes</a> are here, but that means four existing ones must depart.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new characters are named Sindragosa, Elise Starseeker, Brann Bronzebeard, and Sir Finley Mrrgglton. They match up pretty closely with what was leaked a few days ago. Leaving circulation, meanwhile, are King Mukla, Giantfin, Millificent Manastorm, and Lich Baz’hial, though developer <a href="https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23231583/">Blizzard</a> does note that “we may see them return in a future update.”</p>
      <p>The update, which is available now, also includes some big balance changes to existing cards. “We wanted to buff both Demons and Murlocs,” Blizzard states, “so we moved those minions down a Tavern Tier. Junkbot was a bit too strong for Tavern Tier 4 and often made it so mech players never had a good reason to upgrade to Tavern Tier 5. With these changes, we think the minion types are closer together in power level.”</p>
      <p>Take a look at more details on the new characters below.</p>

      <h3>BRANN BRONZEBEARD</h3>
      <p><b>Passive Hero Power:</b> Battle Brand<br/><b>Cost:</b> no cost<br/><b>Ability:</b> After you play a Battlecry minion, give a random friendly minion +1/+1</p>
      <p>Battlecry minions are great to purchase, buff up your minions, and then sell back to Bob for a gold coin. Every time you play a battlecry minion, you’ll give a random friendly minion +1/+1, meaning Brann’s deck should focus on buffing up existing minions and leaving space on the board to buy and sell battlecry cards.</p>
      <h3>ELISE STARSEEKER</h3>
      <p><b>Passive Hero Power:</b> Lead Explorer<br/><b>Cost:</b> no cost<br/><b>Ability:</b> When you upgrade Bob’s Tavern get a ‘Recruitment Map’.</p>
      <p>The Recruitment Map recruits a minion from your current tavern tier after upgrading it at Bob’s Tavern. Seeing as upgrading your tavern tier is a natural progression in the game anyway, this is extra incentive, although the Recruitment Map costs three gold coins to play.</p>
      <h3>SINDRAGOSA</h3>
      <p><b>Passive Hero Power:</b> Stay Frosty<br/><b>Cost:</b> no cost<br/><b>Ability:</b> At the end of your turn, Frozen minions get +1/+1</p>
      <p>Freezing minions in Bob’s Tavern so you can afford them next go is a common move in Battlegrounds, so if you’re planning to purchase a card to make up a triple card, or if you’ve got your eye on these <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/hearthstone/battlegrounds-minions-best">best minions in Hearthstone Battlegrounds</a>, the frozen minions are guaranteed this small bump in stats.</p>
      <h3>SIR FINLEY MRRGGLTON</h3>
      <p><b>Hero Power: Power Up!</b><br/><b>Cost:</b> one coin<br/><b>Ability:</b> Give a random friendly minion +1/+1. After you sell a minion, refresh this.</p>
      <p>Since all the minions you have out on the board you’re likely to keep or upgrade to a triple card, this hero power is great at boosting their attack and health each turn. Although you can’t target the minion you want with this ability, by selling a minion back to Bob’s Tavern, there’s the extra chance of buffing up the card you need.</p>
