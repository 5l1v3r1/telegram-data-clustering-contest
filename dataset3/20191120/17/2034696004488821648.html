        <b>Lovely.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aardman Animations have joined forces with <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/coldplay">Coldplay</a> for the video for their new single ‘Daddy’. Check it out below along with another new song ‘Champion Of The World’.</p>
      <p>The animation company responsible for the <i>Wallace and Gromit</i> and <i>Chicken Run</i> franchises have created a clip that uses live action puppetry, digitally painted sets and 2D animation to symbolise a girl’s memories of her father.</p>

      <p>Directed by Aardman’s Åsa Lucander, the full length, five-minute video follows a girl who is lost at sea, alone in a rowing boat and sailing towards the unknown.</p>

      <p>“It was such an honour to direct this video for Coldplay,” said Lucander. “The first time I listened to the track it spoke to me on a deep level – I immediately started to imagine storylines and images formed in my mind’s eye. When this happens, you know you’re on to something very special! I’m often drawn to emotional stories and I knew very quickly that this was one I wanted to tell.”</p>
      <p>Lucander continued: “‘Daddy’ isn’t a single in the traditional sense, but we always wanted to make a video for it as the song feels like a story within itself. Åsa and her team have done an incredible job in bringing the story to life,” said Phil Harvey, Coldplay’s Creative Director.</p>
      <p>The band have also shared another new song ‘Champion Of The World’, with a co-write credit given to the late Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison.
