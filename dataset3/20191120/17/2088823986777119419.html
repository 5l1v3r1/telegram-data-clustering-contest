      <p>Shoreline flooding is possible along Lake Erie from Thursday night through Friday morning, the National Weather Service said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The weather service issued a flood watch for the shoreline of Erie and Chautauqua counties beginning Thursday evening through 10 a.m. Friday.</p>
      <p>Forecasters predict rain in the area on Thursday. A rapid rise in water levels on top of already high lake levels and "significant wave action" may produce flooding along the shore.</p>
      <p>"The lake level is not expected to be as high as during the Halloween night lakeshore flooding event, but still high enough to have some flooding impacts," the weather service said in a statement.</p>
