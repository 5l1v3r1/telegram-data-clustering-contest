      <h1>Leopard trapped at BEML, released in Nagarahole forest</h1>

      <p>A four-year-old leopard which had found sanctuary on the public sector defence major BEML’s vast campus at Koorgalli industrial area, was trapped on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>There were repeated sightings of the leopard on the campus which has a vast swathe of land that is partially forest area with dense vegetation. The Forest Department placed a cage hoping to trap the animal.</p>
      <p>“We received a call on Wednesday morning that the leopard was trapped and our personnel shifted it from the spot and later released it in Nagarahole National Park,” said Prashanth Kumar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Mysuru.</p>
      <p>At least three or four leopards have been trapped in recent years from the BEML campus and released into the jungles.</p>
      <p>Mr. Prashanth Kumar said this was the 12th leopard trapped this year from the Mysuru territorial division. He pointed out that the leopard could adapt to different types of vegetation and its prey ranged from dogs to spotted deer.</p>
      <p>Apart from the easy availability of prey, the vegetation and habitat in Mysuru-Mandya-Chamarajanagar belt makes it easy for leopards to thrive. The region is home to Nagarahole, Bandipur, Arabhitittu forests, which are all surrounded by a vast hinterland containing reserved forests beyond which is a landscape full of sugarcane fields. All this provides connectivity for the leopards to move around freely.</p>
