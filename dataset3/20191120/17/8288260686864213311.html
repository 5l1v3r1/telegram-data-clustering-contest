      <h1>5G in The Black Country - everything you need to know</h1>
      <h2>EE has confirmed that more of its users will be treated to a 5G speed boost</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:17:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Coussins, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/jordan-coussins/</a></address>
      <p>Phone users across the Black Country could be getting fibre broadband-like speeds on their handset as a major rollout is flicked live.</p>
      <p>Customers on EE, which is owned by BT, will be among the first in the country to experience 5G speeds and will cover most parts of Wolverhampton, Walsall, West Bromwich and Dudley from today (November 20).</p>
      <p>EE began its 5G network rollout in May, initially launching coverage in London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, Birmingham and Manchester.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Fellow operators Vodafone, O2 and Three have since begun their own introductions of 5G coverage.</p>
      <p>Wendy Sycamore, BT group regional lead for the Midlands, said: “It’s great to see the Black Country amongst the first locations in the UK to welcome 5G. The new technology will enable a faster, more reliable mobile connection for both consumers and businesses in the area and is set to play a pivotal role in our lives.”</p>
      <p>Ninder Johal, board member of the Black Country LEP, said: “The arrival of 5G across the Black Country offers the latest technology and high-speed connectivity to many across the region, which will further foster innovation and partnerships.</p>
      <p>“We are hopeful that 5G will bring in a new era where everyone and everything is better connected. We believe 5G presents a number of opportunities to local businesses, students and local residents – allowing them to access the internet at much faster speeds, and enabling more innovation in our key employment sectors across the Black Country, including automotive, high value manufacturing, healthcare, and construction.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>HOW MUCH FASTER WILL 5G BE?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Depending on where you are in the country it could be possible to get an average download speed of around 20 to 30Mbps on 4G.</p>
      <p>But 5G takes things to a new level with average speeds expected to exceed 100Mbps – with some users could get up to 1Gbps.</p>
