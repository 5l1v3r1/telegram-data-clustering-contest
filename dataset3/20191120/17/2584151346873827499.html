      <h2>British environmental activist says genocide was ‘just another fuckery in human history.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:15:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Anderson</a></address>
      <p>The co-founder of the environmental movement Extinction Rebellion has come under fire after he described the Holocaust as "just another fuckery in human history."</p>
      <p>In an interview with German newspaper <a href="https://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2019-11/extinction-rebellion-co-founder-roger-hallam-holocaust">Die Zeit</a> published Wednesday, the British activist Roger Hallam said genocides have been "like a regular event" throughout history and that Germans' attitude toward the Holocaust has been holding them back.</p>
      <p>The "fact of the matter is, millions of people have been killed in vicious circumstances on a regular basis throughout history," Hallam said, citing as an example the Belgians, who "went to the Congo in the late 19th century and decimated it."</p>
      <p>"The extremity of a trauma can create a paralysis in actually learning the lessons from it."</p>
      <p>In response to the interview, the German branch of Extinction Rebellion said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ExtinctionR_DE/status/1197122581083676672/photo/1">statement</a> that it distanced itself "decisively" from Hallam's "downplaying and relativizing statements about the Holocaust," adding that he did not speak for the German group.</p>
      <p>"For some months, Hallam's statements have also polarized the Extinction Rebellion movement internally," the statement said.</p>
      <p>German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1197113471546134530">tweet</a> of Hallam’s interview that “the Holocaust involved millions dead and horrible torture methods. Killing Jews in an industrial way and wanting to eradicate them is incomparably inhuman. We must always be aware of this so that we can ensure: never again!”</p>
      <p>Ullstein, the German publisher of Hallam's book "Common Sense," which was set to be released in Germany on November 26, <a href="https://twitter.com/Ullstein/status/1197154193594818562">said Wednesday</a> that it would halt publication due to Hallam's statements.</p>
      <p>Members of the far-right Alternative for Germany also criticized Hallam, with deputy parliamentary group leader Beatrix von Storch <a href="https://twitter.com/Beatrix_vStorch/status/1197158182818402304">tweeting</a>: "The climate-Nazis of Extinction Rebellion have let their masks fall. They want to abolish democracy and relativize the Holocaust."</p>
      <p>Founded in October last year, Extinction Rebellion has led <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/london-mayor-condemns-extinction-rebellion-tube-action/">large-scale demonstrations</a> in cities including London and Berlin to push for greater action to combat climate change and threats of mass extinction.</p>
