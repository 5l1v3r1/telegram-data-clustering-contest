      <p>In just four years, <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/kylie-jenner/">Kylie Jenner</a>’s Kylie Cosmetics has hit the $1 billion mark.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/beauty-2/">beauty</a> mogul and reality TV star leveraged her fame and signature pout to create one of the most lucrative businesses in the <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/color-cosmetics/isetan-renovates-beauty-floor-new-brands-customizations-1203374969/">beauty</a> industry. She’s expanded her reign to skin care with the <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/kylie-jenner-announces-skin-care-brand-on-instagram-1203129596/">launch of Kylie Skin</a>, and now has her sights set on <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/kylie-jenner-hair-care-brand-1203131770/">creating a hair-care line</a> and <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/kylie-jenner-baby-line-everything-to-know-1203130828/">baby products.</a></p>
      <p>Now that Jenner has <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/color-cosmetics/kylie-jenner-sells-majority-stake-in-beauty-business-to-coty-1203372780/">sold a majority stake of her business to Coty Inc.</a> for $600 million, WWD looks back at the trajectory of her business, including her many collaborations, product launches and partnerships.</p>
      <p>Read on to see how Jenner turned her beauty empire into a $1 billion business.</p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <b>November 2015</b>
      </p>
      <p>At 18 years old, <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/halloween-2019-celebrity-instagram-posts-heidi-klum-kylie-jenner-kim-kardashian-1203360918/">Kylie Jenner</a> embarked on her beauty business with the launch of Kylie Lip Kits on Nov. 30, 2015 — a collection of three lip liquid lipsticks with corresponding lip liners.</p>
      <p>Jenner launched the trio of products as a test run, producing just 5,000 units of each shade priced at $29. The products sold out immediately and it took roughly six months to produce the next batch of products.</p>
      <p>
        <b>February 2016</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the initial success of Kylie Lip Kits, Jenner renamed the brand Kylie Cosmetics and added three new shades of lip kits to her product range for Valentine’s Day. Production was boosted to 500,000 units of all six shades to satisfy consumer demand.</p>
      <p>
        <b>July 2016</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jenner expanded the brand outside of the lip category in July 2016, introducing her first Kyshadow palette, a nine-pan eye shadow palette with bronze and neutral colors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>November 2016</b>
      </p>
      <p>November 2016 proved to be a busy month for Jenner. She embarked on Kylie Cosmetics’ first collaboration, teaming with half-sister Khloé Kardashian for the Koko x Kylie collection. The collection included a four-piece lipstick set, which immediately sold out upon launch.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Jenner later restocked the collection multiple times and has teamed with Khloé for two more collaborations since.</p>
      <p>Later in the month, Jenner released her first Kylie Cosmetics holiday collection, which included mini liquid lipsticks, lip kits, crème eye shadows, a new Kyshadow palette, the brand’s first set of brushes and a <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/makeup/">makeup</a> bag.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/kylie-jenner-cosmetics-to-become-billion-dollar-brand-10959016/">In an interview with WWD</a> in August 2017, Jenner revealed that the launch of the holiday collection on Nov. 21, 2016, was the brand’s biggest sales day to date, generating roughly $19 million in just 24 hours.</p>
      <p>
        <b>December 2016</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jenner made her foray into brick-and-mortar retail in December 2016 with her <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/color-cosmetics/kylie-cosmetics-kylie-jenner-store-10709653/">first Kylie Cosmetics pop-up shop</a> held at the Topanga Westfield Mall in Los Angeles. The pop-up included a wall of rainbow colored lip kits and merchandise from Kylie’s apparel merchandise shop.</p>

        <embed-post data-src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BN2SpbzBU7o" data-service="Instagram"/>
      </figure>
      <p>She later went on to host more pop-ups nationwide, including one in New York the following February and one <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/kylie-cosmetics-pop-up-san-francisco-1202674410/">in San Francisco</a> in May 2018.</p>
      <p>
        <b>February 2017</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kylie Cosmetics expanded yet again in the beginning of 2017, launching its first product in the face category with Kylighter, a collection of six highlighter shades.</p>
      <p>
        <b>April 2017</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jenner looked to her famous family again for her next Kylie Cosmetics collaboration, creating the KKW by Kylie Cosmetics crème lipstick set with half-sister <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a>.</p>
      <figure>
        <embed-post data-src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BTFR5JDl11H" data-service="Instagram"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The collaboration served as a <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/color-cosmetics/kim-kardashian-kkw-makeup-interview-business-projections-10917558/">litmus test for Kardashian’s own KKW Beauty brand</a>, which she launched a few months later in November. The KKW by Kylie Cosmetics collaboration sold out immediately, generating $13.5 million in sales.</p>

      <p>It was projected that Kylie Cosmetics would experience a 25 percent increase in sales in 2017 with a projection of $386 million for the year.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Jenner embarked on her <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/products/kylie-jenner-kylie-cosmetics-topshop-ink-first-offline-partnership-11039615/">first retail partnership with Topshop</a>, partnering for seven, five-week pop-up shops in the brand’s top-performing U.S. storefronts. Up to this point, the brand strictly operated direct-to-consumer, with her mom revealing to WWD that about 70 percent of transactions took place on a mobile device accessing the Kylie Cosmetics web site.</p>
      <p>
        <b>March 2018</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jenner sent the Internet into a frenzy when she secretly gave birth to daughter Stormi Webster in the beginning of 2018.</p>

      <p>While pregnant, Jenner created the Weather Collection to celebrate her daughter’s birth. The collection included an Eye of the Storm eye shadow palette with 10 storm-inspired shades, lip gloss, highlighters and liquid eye shadow.</p>
      <p>

Jenner, who at the time was 20 years old, was featured on the magazine’s cover that month and is the youngest person to ever make the list.</p>
      <p>Backlash ensued against Jenner for the accolade, with many on social media claiming that the beauty mogul is not “self-made,” considering she launched her business after gaining fame and wealth through her family’s reality show.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>After testing out brick-and-mortar through its pop-up shops at Topshop, <a href="https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/kylie-cosmetics-to-launch-in-ulta-beauty-1202781162/">Kylie Cosmetics entered Ulta Beauty</a> ahead of the holiday season.</p>
      <p>The beauty retailer has publicly commented that the Kylie Cosmetics brand has driven shoppers into the stores. The partnership has quickly expanded since its initial launch, with the brand entering more Ulta Beauty doors and expanding its product offerings in store.</p>
      <p>The same month, Kylie Cosmetics <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/kylie-cosmetics-mobile-app-1202902159/">debuted its mobile app</a>, giving customers an additional channel to shop from the brand.</p>
