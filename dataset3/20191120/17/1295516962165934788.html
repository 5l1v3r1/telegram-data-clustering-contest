      <h1>The Undertaker Was Convinced He Was Going to Debut as the Gobbledy Gooker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:11:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Bernaschina</a></address>
      <p>In a clip from <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> legend Stone Cold Steve Austin's upcoming WWE Network series <i>Steve Austin: The Broken Skull Sessions</i>, The Undertaker (real name Mark Calaway) revealed one of his biggest fears leading up to his debut in the then-WWF.</p>
      <p>"So about the time I got my phone call, they were doing this promotion where, on the show -- back then they'd do three or four weeks in a row -- they had this gigantic egg on the set," The Undertaker said as Stone Cold displayed a photo of the Gobbledy Gooker's egg.  "So this egg appears on the show, right? And all of a sudden my mind just starts going like, 'Aw, man, they're going to bring me in -- now this is how outlandish the gimmicks were back then too -- I'm going to be 'Egg Man.' I had convinced myself, to the point where my stomach hurt, that I'm going to be 'Egg Man.'"</p>

      <p>Of course, Calaway's career would take a radically different turn as he debuted as the iconic Undertaker, a staple in WWE who would go on to win multiple championships and maintain a 21-0 undefeated streak at <i>WrestleMania</i>, which ended in brutal fashion at the hands of Brock Lesnar at <i>WrestleMania 30</i> in 2014.</p>
      <p>The Gobbledy Gooker still debuted at 1990's <i>Survivor Series</i>, albeit with Eddie Guerrero's brother Héctor Guerrero in the costume. However, the poultry-themed character sadly received a negative reaction from fans and would only make a handful of appearances beyond that before being dropped as a regular performer.</p>
