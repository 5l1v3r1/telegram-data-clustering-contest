      <h1>Update For Injured Nebraska RB Wan’Dale Robinson</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T17:50:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 17:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Nebraska freshman Wan’Dale Robinson has been one of the breakout players amidst an otherwise disappointing season. But after missing their last game with an injury, things don’t look too good for Robinson to play this week.</p>
      <p>According to Derek Peterson of Hail Varsity, Robinson was not in pads for Huskers practice today. He missed last week’s game against Wisconsin with a leg injury.</p>
      <p>Robinson has proven to be a very versatile weapon for the Huskers this season. His 326 rushing yards and five total touchdowns are third on the team, while his 453 receiving yards are second on the team.</p>
      <p>He had 22 receptions in the four games prior to his injury.</p>

      <p>Nebraska is in must-win mode heading into the final two games of the season.</p>
      <p>If the Huskers lose to Maryland this weekend, they’ll be eliminated from bowl contention for the third year in a row.</p>
      <p>We may not find out for another few days whether Robinson will truly see the field against Maryland. But the signs aren’t promising at the moment.</p>
