      <p>A British woman has drowned while snorkeling in the Maldives.</p>
      <p>The unnamed 69-year-old died on Sunday during a holiday to the tropical island of Kuredu.</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Izmia Zahir, of the Maldives Police Service, said: "We received reports of a female tourist from the United Kingdom drowning.</p>
      <p>"Police attended the hospital and found that the woman was a 69-year-old British woman who had been staying at Kuredu Island Resort and Spa.</p>
      <p>"According to the resort, the incident took place while she was snorkelling."</p>

      <p>At least six holidaymakers have already drowned so far this year in the Maldives where swimmers are warned to beware of strong currents.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Kuredu Island Resort and Spa said it would be inappropriate to comment at this time.</p>
      <p>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office added: “We are supporting the family of a British woman following her death in the Maldives.</p>
      <p>“We keep our travel advice under constant review and make regular updates, to give British people the information they need to stay safe when travelling abroad.”</p>

      <p>In 2012, British tourist Sharon Duvalis's body was found washed up in Kuredu, Maldives, the day before she and her husband Nick were due to return home.</p>
      <p>Just weeks previously, two English honeymooners had been killed in a quad bike crash on the same island.</p>
      <p>Jonathan and Emma Gray died in the horror smash on the paradise island of Kuredu just a week after they wed.</p>
      <p>Emma, 25, and Jonathan, in his late 20s, flew to the resort, popular with honeymoon Brits, after their church wedding.</p>
