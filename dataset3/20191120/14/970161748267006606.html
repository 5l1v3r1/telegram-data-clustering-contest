      <p>Pamela Anderson has announced her ‘new chapter’ just one day after charges against her friend Julian Assange were dropped.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old took to Instagram with a whole new lease of life following the news.</p>
      <p>And to mark the occasion, the star shared a string of black and white glamorous photos onto her grid, because why the heck not?</p>
      <p>In one, the mother-of-two can be seen in her iconic Baywatch attire as she held boxing gloves up to her face in front of a punch bag.</p>
      <p>Writing in the caption, Pamela explained: ‘Back on it … body, mind, spirit.’</p>

      <p>Her pictures come after it was confirmed that charges <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/julian-assange-rape-case-dropped-swedish-prosecutors-11181739/">against her friend Julian Assange had been dropped, amid the alleged rape investigation.</a></p>
      <p>On Tuesday afternoon, Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson said the alleged victim’s complaint was credible.</p>
      <p>However, she added: ‘My assessment is that all investigative measures that can be taken have been taken.</p>
      <p>‘But… the evidence is not strong enough to file an indictment.’</p>
      <p>Earlier on in the day, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/pamela-anderson-cancels-visit-banged-pal-julian-assange-due-personal-emergency-11179964/">Pamela had cancelled her plans to visit the Wikileaks founder</a> do to a ‘personal emergency’.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign said: ‘Pamela has a personal emergency which has meant she has had to go home and cancel everything for the next two weeks.’</p>
