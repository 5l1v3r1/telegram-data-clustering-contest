      <h3>Forza Horizon 4 Introduces the Toyota Supra RZ in December</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 20 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>One of the most popular fan requests has been for Toyota to return to the Forza franchise, and it looks like they've got their wish. Forza Community Manager Brian Ekberg <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgU0PVux1jo">confirmed</a> that the return of Toyota starts in December on <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Forza-Horizon-4/achievements">Forza Horizon 4,</a> when the 1998 Toyota Supra RZ releases on December 12th.</p>

      <p>It's coming as part of the Series 17 update. Ekberg says that, looking ahead, players can expect to see cars from Toyota, Lexus, and perhaps Scion, and for them to be in the franchise for a long time. He emphasises that this won't be happening immediately, and that the soonest we can begin to expect to see the additions of these brands is when the 1998 Toyota Supra arrives in December. Design Director Jon Knoles says that some of the upcoming cars haven't been seen since Forza Motorsport 6, and that they need work to ensure they're up to speed and can support the new weather effects. He and Ekberg clairfy that now a deal's been reached and the agreement has been signed, fans can expect to see Toyota cars in the franchise for years to come.</p>
      <p>They may already be talking about series 17, but <a href="https://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/fh4_series_16">series 16</a> itself only just dropped today. One of its biggest items is the 2019 Ferrari 488 Pista (Italian for "track"); the latest specialist car from Ferrari. This car has 49 extra horsepower, and has lost 40 pounds in engine weight, along with improvements to its airflow and downforce.</p>

      <p>Three other cars have been introduced; another Ferrari, an ATS, and a Lamborghini. The 1970 Ferrari 512 S got the first season win of 1970 at Sebring. The 2018 ATS GT is a revisioning of the design of the 2500 GT. The 1999 Lamborghini Diablo GTR starts with a 6-liter GT car and was made to race in Lamborghini's Diablo Supertrofeo one-make series. There were only 40 ever built. Series 16 also brings two new showcase remixes: Morning Rush and Motorcross Purposes. The font has been improved, with the text being moved to the bottom centre of the screen instead of the left-hand side. The size of the font can now be changed, whilst the transparency of the subtitle background can be adjusted and the overall effect can be previewed by pressing the Options button. Season 17 starts on December 12th, and heralds the return of the Toyota brand, along with Lexus and Scion, and kicking the whole thing off is the release of a legend: the 1998 Toyota Supra.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim.
