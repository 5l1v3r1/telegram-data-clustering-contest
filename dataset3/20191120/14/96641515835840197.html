      <p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/15/fortnite-chapter-2-is-here-new-map-boats-and-less-grind/">first season of <i>Fortnite</i>'s Chapter 2</a> promises to be the longest-running one to date. Until now, seasons have lasted between two and three months, but the current one will run for almost four.</p>
      <p>The season started in tandem with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/15/fortnite-chapter-2-first-impressions/">a major overhaul of the game last month</a> and Epic Games <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">is extending it</a> into early February so it can focus on "holiday-themed updates." It ran a 14 Days of <i><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/19/fortnite-directx-12-update/">Fortnite</a></i> event over the holidays last year, and it's promising to go even bigger for festive fun this time around with "new game features, free rewards and a live experience that you won't want to miss."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen what Epic has planned for the event. On the flip side, you'll have a bit more time to earn all your Battle Pass rewards.</p>
