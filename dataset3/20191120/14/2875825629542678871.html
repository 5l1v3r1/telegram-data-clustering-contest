      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: TV villain Josie Cunningham sported sleek make-up and perfect hair for a stunning maternity shoot</h2>

      <p>Pregnant <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/josie-cunningham">Josie Cunningham</a> looks totally unrecognisable after undergoing a glam makeover.</p>
      <p>The reality TV star is seen posing next to a Christmas tree in a pink off-the-shoulder dress sporting false eye lashes and perfect hair.</p>
      <p>Despite looking so different, Josie credited good make-up with giving her a whole new look.</p>
      <p>Josie is six months pregnant with her fifth child, a girl who is due on Valentine's Day 2020.</p>
      <p>The mum was vilified when she boasted about getting a Â£5,000 boob job for free on the NHS back in 2013.</p>

      <p>She was later dubbed Britain's most hated woman over the scandal, but later confessed she regretted getting her boobs done.</p>
      <p>Josie caused even more controversy when she threatened to have an abortion so she could enter the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> house, and later sold tickets to the birth of her child.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, Josie appeared on This Morning to reveal she had three sugar daddies, and she wanted one of them to pay for her to get another boob job.</p>

      <p>She said she would "save the NHS money" by getting one of her male admirers to finance surgery to increase her double D boobs.</p>
      <p>The shameless mother-of-four said: "If I can get these sugar daddies to buy me things, I'm saving my own money</p>
      <p>"My kids have had experiences that a lot of children out there won't have had.</p>
      <p>Josie claimed that she gets gifts from her sugar daddies in exchange for company and phone call conversations, but it never gets any more intimate.</p>
