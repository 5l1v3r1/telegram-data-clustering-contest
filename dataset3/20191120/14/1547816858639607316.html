      <p>Well, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-november-20-spoiler-alert-sidharth-shukla-asim-riaz-s-fight-goes-worse-shehnaaz-does-drama-again/5dd4a9f387fb571eff7e41f5">Sidharth Shukla-Asim Riaz fight in last night's episode of Bigg Boss 13</a> has become the talk of town. Twitter is divided into Sid's fans fighting Paras' lovers. Sid's rumoured ex<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-evict-sidharth-shukla-trends-called-psycho-akanksha-puri-does-a-turnaround-on-him-exclusive/5dd4fbee87fb571eff7e426a"> Akanksha Puri did quite a turnaround on him, when she suddenly declared this morning on SpotboyE.com</a> that Sidharth was getting violent and she condemned him for that behaviour.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, no two opinions about the fact that Sidharth's other angle with Rashami Desai is also helping the show. Sidharth is Rashami's ex- the two were passionately in love during the days of Dil Se Dil Tak--- but it was rather marred by their frequent skirmishes. Janata loves the two of them still fighting with each other. But as we told you sometime back and many celebs also agreed with us- that Rashami calling Sidharth as 'namard' was below the belt and uncalled for.</p>

      <p>Dolly said, "I think Rashami has killed all her chances of winning the trophy. She is almost continuously focusing on doing one-upmanship on Sidharth. Same baat ghuma firake bAar baar. Who wants to hear that so frequently."</p>

      <p>"As for the Asim Riaz-Sidharth fight last night, I think Asim provoked Sidharth. Sidharth was not in the wrong," Dolly signed off.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:-Instagram/dollybindra/herzindagi</i></p>
