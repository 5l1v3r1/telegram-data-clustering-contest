      <p>After a whirlwind year filming <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/dune-reboot-movie-cast-zendaya-chani.html"><i>Dune</i></a><i> </i>and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/wes-andersons-new-movie-the-french-dispatch-cast-plot.html"><i>The French Dispatch</i></a> all over the world, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/timothe-chalamet-is-the-perfect-movie-star-for-2018.html">Timothée Chalamet</a> is putting down roots in a bustling metropolis, just not the one you’d think. Next year, New York City’s prodigal son is heading to London to star in Amy Herzog’s Pulitzer-nominated play <i>4,000 Miles</i> at the Old Vic Theater. He’ll be making his London stage debut alongside stage legend <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/09/11-delightful-things-we-learned-from-tea-with-the-dames.html">Dame Eileen Atkins</a>. “Amy Herzog is one of my favourite living writers — she writes with a deceptively powerful simplicity, full of extraordinary grace, precision and radiance,” Old Vic artistic director Matthew Warchus said in a statement to <i>The Guardian</i>. “I’m very much looking forward to working with this exceptional cast on her gorgeous play which abounds with intimate beauty and truth.”</p>
      <p><i>4,000 Miles </i>follows 21-year-old Leo, who sets off on a cross-country cycling trip with his best friend. After going silent for weeks, he appears at his grandmother Vera’s door and they attempt to forge a life beyond grief in Manhattan. We can already picture Timothée Chalamet crying. General tickets <a href="https://www.oldvictheatre.com/your-visit/booking-tickets/priority-booking">go on sale</a> December 3. And plane tickets? How have you not purchased one yet?</p>
