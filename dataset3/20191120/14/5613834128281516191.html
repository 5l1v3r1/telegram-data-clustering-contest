      <h1>‘Joker’ is Getting a Sequel with More Origin Stories in the Works</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:13:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>As we told you several times over the past month, there is no world in which Warner Bros. doesn’t make a sequel to <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/tag/joker/"><i><b>Joker</b></i></a> and expand on their DC Origins universe.</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">THR</a> is making it more “official” as they write that <i>Joker</i> director <b>Todd Phillips</b> is “likely” to reteam with star <b>Joaquin Phoenix</b> on a follow-up to the <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3594339/joker-will-become-first-rated-r-movie-hit-1-billion-worldwide-weekend/">$1 billion-grossing R-rated hit</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition, they share an anecdote in which Phillips headed into Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich’s office, buoyed by the film’s $96.2 million opening-weekend haul – where he proposed an outsized idea — the rights to develop a portfolio of DC characters’ origin stories.</p>
      <p>While he was allegedly balked at, the site reports,<b> “Phillips did emerge from the meeting with the rights to at least <i>one</i> other DC story.”</b></p>
      <p>As for the <i>Joker</i> sequel, the site says Phillips is in talks to reprise his role as director, and will co-pen the film with Scott Silver.</p>
      <p>Warners has sequel options in place for <i>Joker</i> star Joaquin Phoenix, which means he doesn’t have a choice in the matter. He’ll be back if they move forward.</p>
      <p><b><i>Update</i>:</b> Interestingly, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a> throws major shade at <i>THR</i> and disputes the entirety of this morning’s story claiming there are no plans for a sequel (yet) and that there haven’t been any negotiations between Warner and Phillips. They also state the story in which Phillips left a meeting with a single property to adapt is also bunk.</p>
      <p>Frankly, there’s no planet in which a <i>Joker</i> sequel isn’t made. We’ll just have to sit back and wait for an official announcement.</p>
