      <h1>Apple's iPhone 11 battery case includes a dedicated camera button</h1>
      <h2>You don't have to touch your screen to start shooting.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:31:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.facebook.com/jonathanf" target="_blank">Jon Fingas</a></address>
      <p>Apple has introduced new versions of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/01/25/apple-smart-battery-case-review-iphone-xr-xs-max/">Smart Battery Cases</a> for the latest iPhones, but this time there's a better reason to buy than just the extra longevity. Its newly-released cases for the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVJ2LL/A/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-soft-white">iPhone 11</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVL2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVQ2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-max-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-white">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> all include a dedicated camera button that can launch the Camera app, take a photo or (if you hold it) record video. The concept of a camera button on an iPhone case <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/01/27/moment-camera-case/">certainly isn't new</a>, but this is an official option -- and it's hard to find a case that also extends your battery.</p>
      <p>Apple isn't too specific about the battery life claims for each case. Regardless of the iPhone you have, it's touting up to 50 percent longer battery life in a non-stop video playback test. Your experience is likely to vary if you're more interested in other tasks. Having said that, the iPhone 11 series already has healthy battery life -- this might be enough to get you through a weekend if you're not particularly demanding.</p>
      <p>The trio supports wireless charging and will top up quickly if you use a USB-PD wired charger (such as the 18W charger included with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/17/apple-iphone-11-pro-and-pro-max-review/">iPhone 11 Pro</a>).</p>
      <p>Cases for all three models cost $129, and come in black, white and (for the 11 Pro/Pro Max) pink. That makes them more expensive than options like Mophie's $80 Juice Pack Access, and you're covering up the phone's built-in Lightning port where options like Mophie's offer access to both. Few modern alternatives have dedicated camera buttons, though, and Apple is no doubt counting on that, an iOS-native battery meter and the official status to win you over.</p>
