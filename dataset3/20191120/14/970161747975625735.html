      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a> must have the biggest garage on earth for all his gadgets, the latest being a fancy electric bicycle.</p>
      <p>The Purpose star, 25, popped a wheelie <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/justin-bieber-enjoys-sunny-sunday-cycle-wife-hailey-beverly-hills-11078403/">on the motorised push bike while out and about in Beverly Hills</a> – and looked pretty pleased with himself that he managed to pull off the stunt.</p>
      <p>Justin punched the air and grinned at the waiting photographers as he pulled off the trick despite the bike’s heavy-looking wheels and bodywork.</p>
      <p>He was keeping himself amused while his new wife, Hailey Baldwin, is in Germany for work, and it looked like his new toy was definitely curing the boredom.</p>
      <p>An electric bike like the one Justin was riding retails around £1,000 and can get up to 25km (15.5miles) an hour.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/11/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-no-plans-head-honeymoon-tying-knot-lavish-second-wedding-10899102/">Justin and Hailey had their second wedding ceremony in September</a> for their friends and family after having tied the knot at a New York courthouse a year earlier.</p>

      <p>As well as riding around on his new toy, Justin was also seen heading to the studio in Los Angeles as well as the dermatologist to deal with a breakout.</p>

      <p>He’d shared his skin troubles with fans on his Instagram story, as well as photos of his other vehicles including motorbikes and his baby pink Lamborghini.</p>

      <p>He’s also had some less practical vehicles in the form of Can-Am Spyder motorbike which he was once filmed riding on a pavement and narrowly missing pedestrians, and quad bike or two.</p>
      <p>While his car insurance must be through the roof for this vast amount of high-performance supercars, at least he can afford it…</p>
