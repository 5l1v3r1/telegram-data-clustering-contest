      <h2>York St John University student Louis Duxbury, 22, claimed he was only talking about extremists and terrorists - but it was not his first inflammatory anti-Islam remark</h2>

      <p>A student who posted a video on Facebook saying Muslims should be "wiped off the face of the earth" is facing being jailed.</p>
      <p>Louis Duxbury, 22, issued the "call to arms" during a 17-minute rant made shortly after a series of terrorist attacks in 2017.</p>
      <p>A social media user at York St John University, where Duxbury was an undergraduate, saw the post and reported it to the police.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at his trial last week, Duxbury claimed he was exercising his right to free speech.</p>
      <p>However, a jury at York Crown Court yesterday found him guilty of inciting religious hatred after deliberating for only half an hour.</p>

      <p>The Recorder of York, Judge Sean Morris granted him bail until November 29, when he will be sentenced for the offence.</p>
      <p>He warned him: "People who incite religious or racial hatred create terrible trouble for our society. It will be a custodial sentence."</p>

      <p>The court heard Duxbury was first reported to police about his far-right views as a 15-year-old schoolboy in 2015.</p>
      <p>Teachers reported him for an inflammatory anti-Islam comment he posted online following the murder of Fusilier Rigby, it was heard.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence at his trial, Duxbury claimed that the 2017 video was a “rant”, adding he believes in a diverse, multi-cultural society.</p>
      <p>He claimed he was only talking about extremists and terrorists and not Muslims in general and that he was neither racist nor fascist, claiming he was apolitical.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Glenn Parsons said he could say little in mitigation, but asked for Duxbury to have time to set his affairs in order.</p>
      <p>He will appear at the same court next Friday. </p>
