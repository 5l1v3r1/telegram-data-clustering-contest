      <h1>‘Joker’ Sequel in the Works, With Todd Phillips Also Planning Yet Another DC Character Origin Movie</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:42:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/author/chris-evangelista/" target="_blank">Chris Evangelista</a></address>
      <p><b><i>Joker</i></b> is a huge hit, probably headed towards several Oscar nominations, and just became the first R-rated movie to cross $1 billion at the worldwide box office. That’s the kind of attention studios thrive on, and want more of. And sure enough, after weeks of speculation, it looks like a <i>Joker</i> sequel is officially happening. Director <b>Todd Phillips</b> pitched Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman<b> Toby Emmerich</b> on an idea to develop <i>Joker</i>-style origin stories for multiple DC character, and while Emmerich didn’t fully go for the idea, Phillips did get the rights to develop a film on at least one character. Meaning Phillips is now working on both a <i>Joker</i> sequel (which will likely bring back<b> Joaquin Phoenix</b>) and another <i>Joker</i>-influenced DC origin film.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a> is saying THR is incorrect, and that “Multiple sources said no such October 7 meeting between Phillips and Emmerich occurred, and that Phillips hasn’t even considered overseeing other DC character films.” So who is correct here?</p>
      <p>Update #2: <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/joker-sequel-todd-phillips-1203410411/">Variety</a> decided to get in on the action now, too. They say the original story is half-true: Warners is exploring a sequel with Todd Phillips, but nothing has been finalized and no scripts are currently being written. As for the report of a separate DC character origin film? That’s false, at least according to Variety. The original story continues below</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">THR</a> has the scoop on the <i>Joker</i> sequel, and adds that Todd Phillips wants to make at least one other <i>Joker</i>-style movie about another DC character. In fact, Phillips wanted to make <i>multiple</i> movies about multiple characters. But even though <i>Joker</i> is a smash hit, WB’s Toby Emmerich was resistant to the idea, since Warners is “very protective of the DC canon.”</p>
      <p>But Phillips did lock down “rights to at least one other DC story,” and will be making a <i>Joker</i> sequel as well. There’s no word on who this other DC character might be, or if it’ll be another villain, a la<i> Joker</i>. One can assume, though, that this separate film will tie into the alternate DC universe Phillips built up in <i>Joker</i>. My vote is for Phillips to make an extremely gritty Crazy Quilt movie.</p>
      <p>As for the <i>Joker</i> sequel, Joaquin Phoenix is likely to return. Warners has sequel options with the actor, and I’m sure they’re working out a deal to net Phoenix a huge payday as we speak. And then perhaps Phoenix will go dance down those steps to celebrate. But just what the heck would a <i>Joker</i> sequel focus on? Will Phoneix’s Arthur Fleck/Joker rise into the full-blown crimelord we know from the comics? That would seem to go against everything in <i>Joker</i>, which is more of a small-scale character study. One thing seems certain: while a young Bruce Wayne appeared in <i>Joker</i>, don’t expect Batman to pop-up in this sequel, since the Caped Crusader is firmly in the hands of director Matt Reeves for now.</p>
      <p>Many of my colleagues have soured on <i>Joker</i>, or didn’t even care for it to begin with. I was a bit more positive – I gave it a positive review, citing Phoenix’s fantastic character work and the grimy visual style of the film. That said, I had major problems with the script, which was overly simplistic and owed far too much to films like <i>Taxi Driver</i> and <i>The King of Comedy</i>. Hopefully, Phillips can come up with a better screenplay this time around.</p>
