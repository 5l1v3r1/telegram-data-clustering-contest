      <p>Rent arrears accumulated by tenants on Universal Credit since their claim began totalled £1.2 million as at September 2019.</p>
      <p>The Update on Welfare Reform Legislative Changes report by Daniel Lowe, executive director for housing and technical resources, outlined the cost to the council of Universal Credit since it was introduced in South Lanarkshire in October 2015.</p>
      <p>He said: “Despite extensive resources being deployed in supporting tenants to minimise Universal Credit payment errors and delays, the impact on tenants and rent collection under Universal Credit continues to be a challenge.</p>
      <p>“Housing services support council tenants and other service users affected by the welfare reform programme providing support, assistance and advice to those affected by the under occupancy provisions, the benefit cap and those in receipt of Universal Credit.</p>

      <p>“The work to date has made a significant contribution in terms of supporting those affected to deal with the impact of the changes and minimise the impact upon customers, the council budget and services.</p>
      <p>“Universal Credit is the most significant of the welfare changes.</p>
      <p>“As at the end of September 2019, there were 2358 council tenants affected by the under occupancy deduction.</p>
      <p>“Where a tenant is affected by the under occupancy provision, they are provided with support and help to apply for a Discretionary Housing Payment which will mitigate the shortfall in rent.</p>
      <p>“The benefit cap has now been reduced from £26,000 to £20,000 for a couple and from £18,200 to £13,400 for a single person.</p>
      <p>“As at September 2019, 76 households across South Lanarkshire were affected by the benefit cap, with a total weekly housing benefit reduction of approximately £3580.38.</p>
      <p>“The resource continues to work with households affected to provide advice and support and signpost to partner agencies for services such as money and benefit advice.”</p>
