      <p>Prince Andrew's <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/elaine-carmody-cardiff-court-jailed-17247639">Newsnight interview</a> was described more like an "articulated lorry crash" than a "car crash", but it doesn't appear to have put him off speaking out.</p>
      <p>According to sources, he reportedly considering a second interview to discuss his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has faced a barrage of criticism with the royal accused of a lack of empathy with Epstein's victims and a lack of remorse for his friendship with the disgraced financier during the interview that was shown at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The interview has been described as "nuclear explosion level bad" as the prince defended his relationship with convicted sex offender and billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, who was facing sex trafficking charges when he died in prison.</p>

      <p>In an <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-newsnight-17269102">often rambling series of statements</a> , Prince Andrew offered his presence at a Pizza Express in Woking and a medical condition that meant he couldn't sweat as proof that claims being made against him were false.</p>
      <p>He cast doubts on the veracity of a photograph appearing to show him with his arm around the waist of one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre, by saying he had no recollection of it being taken, that he does not give public displays of affection and wears certain clothes while out in London.</p>
      <p>The former palace press spokesman Dickie Arbiter described the interview as excruciating. The interview, he said, was “not so much a car crash but an articulated lorry crash”.</p>

      <p>But it hasn't put him off, and according to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_brand=vanity-fair&amp;utm_social-type=earned">Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl</a> , he now wants to do a second chat to "put right the things he didn't say".</p>
      <p>A source told the Mirror: "There are rumors swirling that Andrew wants to do another interview.</p>
      <p>Andrew hasn’t drawn a line under it. He wants the chance to put right the things he didn’t say.</p>
      <p>"Newsnight gave him the chance to show some remorse. He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say. It was an open goal - he didn’t grasp it, and I think he sees that now."</p>
      <p>However Buckingham Palace is "not aware" that anything is in the pipeline at this point.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that Andrew told aides he was “happy” with his performance despite being grilled by Maitlis on his relationship with Epstein, a convicted sex offender who killed himself in jail earlier this year while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Epstein's victims have urged the duke to tell US authorities what he knows.</p>
