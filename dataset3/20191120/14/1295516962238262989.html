      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/nwa">National Wrestling Alliance</a> announcer Jim Cornette has resigned from the wrestling promotion after making a racist joke during a singles match between Nick Aldis and Trevor Murdoch on the <i>NWA Powerrr</i> weekly YouTube show.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.nationalwrestlingalliance.com/news/jim-cornette-resigns-from-the-national-wrestling-alliance">statement released on its website</a> Wednesday, the NWA called Cornette's comments "both offensive and do not meet the high standards of decency and good faith of the National Wrestling Alliance."</p>

      <p>"To ensure that such an error can never happen again, we've established new procedures of review for all NWA programming going forward," the statement goes on to read. "We sincerely regret our failure in this regard."</p>
      <p>Cornette has since responded to his resignation with a post on Twitter, urging his fans to tune into this Friday's edition of the <i>Jim Cornette Experience</i> podcast for his full reaction.</p>
      <p>"Morning everybody! Heard any good jokes lately?" Cornette tweeted. "This coming Friday's Jim Cornette Experience (wherever you find your favorite podcasts) is liable to be a good one if you like hearing stupid people told what they can do with their stupidity."</p>

      <p>The racist joke that caused Cornette to resign involved a wrestler, a bucket of fried chicken and the African country of Ethiopia. “[Trevor Murdoch] is the only man I’ve ever known that can strap a bucket of fried chicken on his back and ride a motor scooter across Ethiopia," Cornette said while calling the Aldis/Murdoch match. "Trevor Murdoch can take care of himself!” The episode of <i>NWA Powerrr</i> has since been removed from the company's YouTube channel.</p>
