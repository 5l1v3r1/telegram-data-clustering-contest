      <h1>2020 Mercedes EQC Pricing Announced, Cheaper Than Audi E-Tron</h1>
      <h2>The EQC is also more affordable than the Jaguar I-Pace.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/adrian-padeanu/" target="_blank">Adrian Padeanu</a></address>
      <p>As it’s generally the case with German cars, the Mercedes EQC is fashionably late to the U.S. market where it’s scheduled to go on sale early next year. We <a href="https://www.motor1.com/reviews/349504/2020-mercedes-benz-eqc400-first-drive/">reviewed</a> the first electric Mercedes to be sold under the EQ brand back in May when it had an estimated starting price of $75,000, but it turns out the EQC is more attainable than initially thought.</p>
      <p>At the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/la-auto-show/">2019 Los Angeles Auto Show</a>, Mercedes is announcing the 2020 EQC 400 4Matic carries a starting price of $67,900 MSRP, excluding the $995 destination and delivery charge. It means the zero-emissions crossover undercuts both the $74,800 Audi E-Tron and the $69,500 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/jaguar/i-pace/">Jaguar I-Pace</a>. As for the Model X, Tesla dropped the standard version a few months ago and that means pricing currently kicks off at $84,990 for the Long Range model.</p>

      <p>As a refresher, the EQC is powered by two electric motors giving it a combined output of 402 horsepower and 561 pound-feet of torque, which is more than the 355 hp and 414 lb-ft offered by the Audi. That said, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/audi/e-tron/">E-Tron</a> does have a boost mode raising output to an EQC-matching 402 hp and 490 lb-ft. It’s also more powerful than the I-Pace as Jaguar has rated its electric crossover at 394 hp and 512 lb-ft.</p>
      <p>The all-wheel-drive EQC does 0 to 60 mph in 4.8 seconds and tops out at an electronically capped 112 mph. Range is still TBA for the time being, but we do know the 80-kWh lithium-ion battery pack needs 10 hours to get from 10% to 100% from a wallbox (240V/32A) and 40 minutes from 10% to 80% using DC fast charging (110kW).</p>

      <p>It’s worth mentioning the EQC will also have to do battle with the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/315344/bmw-previews-ix3-i4-inext/">BMW iX3</a> scheduled for a release next year as a fully electric version of the X3. At the ongoing show in L.A., Audi introduced a sleeker version of its E-Tron carrying the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/383276/audi-e-tron-sportback-debuts/">Sportback suffix</a>.</p>
      <p>As a final note, Mercedes unveiled an <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/345040/mercedes-benz-eqc-edition-1886/">EQC Edition 1886</a> with several cosmetic tweaks at the New York Auto Show earlier this year, but pricing details for the limited-run version are not available at the moment of writing.</p>
