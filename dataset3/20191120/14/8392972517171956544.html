      <p>Martin Kemp has admitted he voted for his son Roman to do the Bushtucker eating trial on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a>.</p>
      <p>Capital FM DJ Roman <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebritys-adele-roberts-gags-as-she-eats-pig-uterus-in-tonights-eating-trial/">will take on the challenge tonight</a> (November 20) alongside campmate Adele Roberts.</p>
      <p>On Monday's show, Roman had mocked his dad's singing and it seems Martin had the perfect revenge.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Martin tweeted last night: "Just voted for my boy to eat Kangaroo [Expletive]. That’ll show him!! @romankemp."</p>
      <p>Fans were in hysterics over Martin's tweet.</p>
      <p>One person said: "Not a sentence I expected to ever see but I’m not disappointed either."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Brilliant that’s what I would do to my kids."</p>
      <p>A third added: "Parenting at its best right there!!! He’s great."</p>

      <p>It comes after Roman poked fun at his dad as he said Martin "couldn't even sing or play an instrument" when he first started in Spandau Ballet in the late seventies.</p>
      <p>He cheekily added: "He still can't. He still hasn't realised his mic wasn't on for Live Aid!"</p>
      <aside>Brilliant that’s what I would do to my kids.</aside>
      <p>But the conversation then turned serious as Roman continued: "When they went back on tour, post brain tumour and stuff like that, he forgot everything. So he forgot how to play and he forgot all the songs.</p>
      <p>"He knew how to play but he didn't know any of the songs. So I had to learn them and then teach him. I learnt all the Spandau songs and then retaught them to him.</p>

      <p>"All it did was make us like this [close]. Like super close. How can my dad not be my hero through all of that. We're a proper unit."</p>
      <p>Roman will take on tonight's Bushtucker trial, Just Desserts, alongside Adele.</p>
      <p>In a preview clip released by ITV, Adele is seen being served up pig's uterus as she exclaims: "Oh my Goodness! What even is that?!"</p>

      <p>As she puts the whole thing into her mouth, Roman tells her: "That's it, well done. Think of all that amazing food we're going to have tonight. Don't worry about it. Swallow the juices, focus on the chew."</p>
      <p>I'm A Celebrity continues tonight at 9pm on ITV.</p>
