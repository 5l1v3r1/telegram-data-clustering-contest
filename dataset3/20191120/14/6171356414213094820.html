      <h1>Samsung opens Android 10 beta program for the Galaxy Note9 in the UK and South Korea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:08:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/manuel-vonau/" target="_blank">Manuel Vonau</a></address>
      <p>The Galaxy Note10 may have taken the spotlight in Samsung's Note series, but the company hasn't forgotten about the Note9 just yet. About a month after the manufacturer brought the Android 10 beta <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/14/one-ui-2-0-beta-2-fixes-november-patch-note-10-s10-5g/">to its latest stylus-equipped flagship</a>, it's ready to test One UI 2.0 and the new OS version on the Galaxy Note9 â€” in the UK and South Korea, at least.</p>
      <p>Note9 owners in those countries can now sign up for the pre-release software through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.voc">Samsung Members app</a>, where they should find the below One UI 2.0 beta banner. Once that's done, the test version should be downloadable from the <i>Software update</i> menu in the settings.</p>

      <p>One UI 2.0 comes with <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/12/every-new-android-10-feature-detailed-changelog/">all the goodies that Google released with Android 10</a>, plus some enhancements specific to Samsung's skin: The company has redesigned the camera app, cut down on excessive animations, and introduced a screen recorder, among <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/10/samsung-one-ui-2-0-beta-with-android-10-hits-a-snag-delayed-til-mid-october/">many other minor things</a>.</p>
      <p>It's not clear when the beta will roll out to more locations, and we also don't know when Samsung will push Android 10 to the Note9's stable release channel. The <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/19/one-ui-2-0-beta-5-update-hitting-galaxy-s10-as-s9-and-note-9-get-ready-to-join-beta-program/">Galaxy S9 is next in line for the beta</a>, and according to SamMobile, it should arrive next week.</p>
