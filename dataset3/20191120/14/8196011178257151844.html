      <p>A 73-year-old grandmother <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/78-year-old-grandmother-on-hunger-strike-outside-dail-965383.html">has gone on hunger strike</a> to protest against Ireland’s climate change policies.</p>
      <p>Patricia Devlin – who is originally from Australia, but has lived in Monasterevin, Co Kildare, for 20 years – is taking on the four-day strike in hopes of meeting Environment Minister Richard Bruton and calling on him to implement tougher policies to tackle the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>Launching her hunger strike outside the gates of the Dáil on Wednesday, Ms Devlin kicked off a week-long global action by Extinction Rebellion, which campaigns against the current government’s climate polices, which they say will not meet environmental targets.</p>
      <p>Ms Devlin, holding photos of her two grandchildren – Ollie, four, and baby Liam – said she has been an environmental activist off and on for 40 years, and was sparked back into action after becoming a grandmother.</p>

      <p>“Since my grandchildren, they have just awakened in me a whole wonder at life. Being a parent is great but being a grandparent is just amazing,” she said.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got time to reflect on life in these little people and, knowing what’s happening with climate change, I really fear for what kind of life will my grandsons have. Will they have a chance to have grandchildren like me?</p>
      <p>“My emotion is wrapped up in fear that they won’t enjoy the same blessings that we have.”</p>
      <p>Ms Devlin said she is blessed with good health for her age, and has done 48-hour fasts before.</p>
      <p>“I think sometimes it’s meant to be, maybe I’ve been blessed with good health so that I can do this action at 73,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I looked at the tradition of hunger striking, which dates back to pre-Christian times, particularly in Ireland, and that’s why it appealed to me.</p>
      <p>“This particular action is a really classic way of the vulnerable speaking to power, so I’m hoping I can speak to Minister Bruton and it might be a good way to get him out of the little hermit shell he might be in.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to be here until Sunday afternoon but if Minister Bruton wants to meet me before then I’ve achieved my goal.</p>
      <p>“To go through with him the aims of Extinction Rebellion, and tell the truth, we need a lot more explanation and truth telling. I don’t think our climate change plan is going to be able to meet the targets, the aims are too low.</p>
      <p>“We need a just transition, we need to make sure we bring everyone with us.</p>
      <p>“Usually the poorest and most marginalised have an unfair burden to carry, and we’ve seen that with the closure of the Bord Na Mona bogs.</p>

      <p>“So far only €6m has been set aside for climate change. They gave €16m to the greyhounds, so it’s not hard to see where we’re at, really, it’s not good enough.”</p>
      <p>Much of this year’s climate activism has been sparked by children and young people, and Ms Devlin said she believes older generations also have a duty to protect the planet.</p>
      <p>“One of my regrets is that I didn’t keep it up. Maybe if I did this 20 years ago and did it seriously then maybe I wouldn’t need to be here today,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Again, in the Christian tradition fasting has been used for atonement, and maybe that’s worth thinking about for my generation.</p>
      <p>“I think they should do it if they see the sense in it, I think all grandparents must be worried.”</p>
