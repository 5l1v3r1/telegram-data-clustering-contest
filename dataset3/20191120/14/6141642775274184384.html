      <p>A commuter has been criticised for cleaning his teeth and spitting on the floor of a busy Tube station during rush hour.</p>
      <p>Melissa Thermidor, a social media lead for the NHS Blood and Transport team, spotted the man on her morning commute.</p>
      <p>She was waiting for a Northern line service from Euston when she saw him cleaning his teeth, without water, on the platform.</p>
      <blockquote>I didn’t see any toothpaste but he could’ve applied it beforehand<cite>Melissa Thermidor</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Ms Thermidor told the PA news agency: “I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.</p>
      <p>“He then proceeded to spit on the platform and boarded the next train.</p>
      <p>“People just sort of shifted but no-one said anything. I didn’t see any toothpaste but he could’ve applied it beforehand.”</p>
      <p>Ms Thermidor said she was left shocked and concerned.</p>

      <p>“As someone who works for the NHS I was concerned about health and safety,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Plus someone could’ve slipped and there’s the issue around germs as well.</p>
      <p>“I hope he’s OK but also think that the Tube isn’t the place for this sort of behaviour.”</p>
      <blockquote>Clearly, spitting is unacceptable behaviour and is completely at odds with the work we do to ensure everyone has a pleasant journey<cite>Mark Evers, Transport For London</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Transport for London’s chief customer officer, Mark Evers, said: “It’s important that everyone is able to travel comfortably and we run regular Considerate Travel campaigns to raise awareness of how we can make travelling easier for fellow passengers.</p>
      <p>“This includes encouraging people to look up to see if a fellow passenger may be struggling to stand and needs a seat, and encouraging people not to play loud music, eat smelly food or wear a backpack on a crowded vehicle.</p>
      <p>“Clearly, spitting is unacceptable behaviour and is completely at odds with the work we do to ensure everyone has a pleasant journey.”</p>
