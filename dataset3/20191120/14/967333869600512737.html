      <h1>Stoltenberg Claims EU Unable to Defend Europe in Wake of Macron’s ‘Brain Dead’ NATO Jab</h1>
      <h2>Earlier this month, Jens Stoltenberg hit out at French President Emmanuel Macron’s claims that NATO is experiencing “brain death”, instead urging Europe to strengthen its collaboration with the US.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:04:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author">by Oleg Burunov</a></address>
      <p>In <a href="https://elpais.com/internacional/2019/11/19/actualidad/1574181267_900533.htm">an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Pais on Tuesday</a>, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned that the EU should not distance itself from NATO given the bloc’s current defence capability.</p>
      <blockquote>“What I can say today is that NATO is strong, agile and vital to our [EU] security. The European bloc cannot replace the trans-Atlantic alliance. The EU is important, but it cannot defend Europe,” Stoltenberg said when asked to comment on French President Emmanuel Macron’s recent remarks about the alliance’s “brain death.”</blockquote>
      <p>Calling the EU and NATO “two sides of the same coin,” Stoltenberg urged the sides to coexist “together” in a world which he said faces “so many challenges and threats.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Any attempt to distance Europe from North America will not only weaken NATO, but also divide Europe. The EU is a great instrument to generate peace, stability and prosperity, but it cannot replace NATO”, he pointed out, touting it as “the most successful alliance in history.”</blockquote>
      <p>Stoltenberg concluded by referring to NATO’s efforts to “preserve peace and avoid conflicts for 70 years” and pledging that the alliance would “continue to do so for many more decades.”</p>
      <h3>French President Calls NATO ‘Brain Dead’ Alliance</h3>
      <p>His remarks came after<a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead"> French President Emmanuel Macron told The Economist</a> earlier in November that NATO was allegedly experiencing "brain death" due to a lack of coordination and US unpredictability under President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel was quick to respond by saying at the time that “the French president has found rather drastic words to express his views.”</p>
      <blockquote>“This is not how I see the state of cooperation at NATO,” she said, adding that “NATO remains a cornerstone of our security.”</blockquote>
      <p>She was echoed by Stoltenberg who rejected Macron’s remarks and urged the US and Europe to "work together more than we have done for decades”.</p>
      <h3>Macron Calls for Creation of European Army</h3>
      <p>In November 2018, Macron insisted that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201812081070515998-trump-macron-army-proposal/">the EU should have a “real European army” independent of the United States</a> and NATO to be able to defend itself from alleged threats emanating from Washington, Beijing and Moscow.</p>
      <p>After the idea was endorsed by Merkel, Berlin and Paris agreed on creating a joint aircraft and combat system, inviting other European states to join the project.</p>
      <blockquote>President Trump, in turn, slammed Macron's push for forming a pan-European military as "very insulting”,  arguing that NATO countries should first pay their fair share of the alliance.</blockquote>
      <p>The US President has repeatedly pressed NATO member states to meet their annual defence spending obligations in the alliance, even insisting that they raise their expenditures to 4 percent of GDP — instead of the existing target of 2 percent.</p>
