      <p>The Employees Provident Fund is the prime scheme introduced under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Act, 1952. The scheme offers provident funds for factory and organization establishments across the country. Under this scheme, employee and the employer both contribute a 12% of the basic salary and dearness allowance of the employee towards the fund. The fund can be withdrawn for any expenses or medical expenditure.</p>
