      <p>Whether Joker would be a standalone movie was up for much discussion especially when prior to its release it was met with heat from antigun activists and shooting victims after the much-hyped violence that was said to be at the crux of the movie.</p>
      <p>But now, it seems that the intentions are clear.</p>
      <p>It has been reported that there could be a sequel in the works after Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker surpassed the billion-dollar mark at the box office.</p>
      <p>Todd Phillips is said to be in talks to return as director for the sequel and is thought to be writing the script with Scott Silver, who also worked on this year’s Joker.</p>
      <p>Oscar-tipped Joaquin is said to have an option sequel with Warner Bros to return as Arthur Fleck and continue to the origin storyline. But Warner Bros. and Philips have so far stayed quiet on the reports.</p>

      <p>While it’s been reported that the studio rejected Phillips’ original pitch of tackling several origin stories for different characters, it has been reported that he could have the rights to one other DC story. Who could that character be?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Joaquin recently admitted that playing The Joker is ‘terrifying’.</p>
      <p>The star revealed he had no real preconceptions going into the title role in Phillips’ DC Comics blockbuster tackling the origin of Batman’s greatest villain, and the potential for danger is what sold him on the role.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I didn’t really know what it was. I didn’t know how to classify it.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t say, “This is the character I’m playing.” I didn’t know what we were going to do. It was terrifying.’</p>

      <p>Phoenix explained his criteria for his roles is quite a simple one, in that the projects have to carry ‘a unique vision’ above all else.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I don’t really care about genre or budget size, anything like that. It’s just whether there is a filmmaker that has a unique vision, has a voice, and the ability to make the film.’</p>
      <p>The Walk The Line star revealed he always asks himself the same question when it comes to deciding whether or not to take on a new project, and he only sees his film career coming to an end when either he or the audience gets bored.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘What’s going to keep me excited or inspired, and wanting to work hard?</p>
      <p>‘If I don’t feel like I’m pushing myself in some ways, I’ll get bored, or maybe they’ll get bored of me. I don’t know who’s going to get bored of who first.’</p>
