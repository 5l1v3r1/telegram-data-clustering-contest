      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> received a host of injury boosts on Wednesday as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/eric-bailly/">Eric Bailly</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/luke-shaw/">Luke Shaw</a>, Axel Tuanzebe, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nemanja-matic/">Nemanja Matic</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/diogo-dalot/">Diogo Dalot</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/timothy-fosu-mensah/">Timothy Fosu-Mensah</a> all took part in training.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took charge of training at Carrington ahead of United’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clash with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sheffield-united/">Sheffield United</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The United boss welcomed back some of his players on international duty and several first-team stars who have been struggling with injuries.</p>
      <p>The club confirmed defensive trio Bailly, Fosu-Mensah and Dalot were back in training, but conducted their own session away from the main group.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/manchester-united-extend-eric-baillys-contract-despite-another-injury-plagued-season-11182826/">Bailly and Fosu-Mensah are yet to play this season</a> while Dalot has not featured for United since October.</p>
      <p>While that defensive trio continued their recovery, Matic, Shaw and Tuanzebe were able to take part in the main session.</p>

      <p>Matic has barely played this season as he has struggled to break into Solskjaer’s team, while Shaw has been nursing a hamstring issue and Tuanzebe a hip problem.</p>
      <p>While Matic has been continually overlooked by Solskjaer, he may get a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/manchester-united-fear-scott-mctominay-four-weeks-suspected-ankle-ligament-damage-11078880/">recall due to an injury to Scott McTominay</a>.</p>
      <p>The Scotsman did not train with the group and was forced to pull out of international duty this month due to an ankle injury.</p>

      <p>Ashley Young also trained and he will be available for selection against Sheffield following his suspension for United’s previous game.</p>
      <p>United are nine points off fourth place, with Sheffield flying high in fifth place, two spots above the Red Devils.</p>
