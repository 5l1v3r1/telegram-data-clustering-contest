      <p>Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) women’s featherweight champion, Cristiane Justino, is showing mixed martial arts (MMA) fans a part of her they haven’t seen before — literally — with one of those artsy-fartsy photo shoots in black and white.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian is set to make her Bellator MMA debut opposite Julia Budd at the promotion’s upcoming event on Jan. 25, 2019 inside The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., against reigning 145-pound titleholder and fellow Strikeforce veteran Julia Budd.</p>
      <p>Here's another look:</p>

      <p>“On January 25th I look to make history becoming the only fighter, male or female, to win every major world title in their weight class,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>Justino (21-2, 1 NC) held gold for Strikeforce, Invicta FC, and UFC, and will look to capture her fourth straight title against “The Jewel” in roughly two months. “Cyborg” turned 34 back in July and departed UFC after her decision win over Felicia Spencer at UFC 240.</p>
