      <p>The lehenga is very detailed and has beautiful embroidery done over the same. The flowers are made using sequins silk threads and crystals. The color is so pretty and would be perfect if you don’t want to wear mainstream bright colors for your big day. Pastels are anyway in and go with bright as well as subtle makeup. Her blouse is a little different than the regular cholis and is a jacket with puff sleeves and floral corsages. She has paired it with a light organza stole which you can give a ditch and go for a heavy dupatta with embroidered border on it.</p>
      <p>Isha complimented her look with a diamond choker and studs which are perfect as the lehenga is quite exquisite already. It would be great if you go with smokey or pink hue eye makeup and nude lips.</p>
