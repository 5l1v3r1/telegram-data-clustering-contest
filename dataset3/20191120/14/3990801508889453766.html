      <h1>This fish-farming Mitsubishi subsidiary just put salmon on the blockchain</h1>
      <h2>Cermaq salmon can soon be tracked 'from egg to store'</h2>

      <p>Norwegian Mitsubishi subsidiary Cermaq is putting salmon on the blockchain and feeding it to the French.</p>
      <p>Cermaq’s ‘blockchainified’ salmon will be sold by French food company Labeyrie. A <a href="https://www.cermaq.com/wps/wcm/connect/cermaq/contact-us/article-pressroom#/pressreleases/cermaq-contributes-to-traceability-with-blockchain-2945012">press release</a> notes consumers will be able to scan special QR codes on Labeyrie labels to receive comprehensive details about the salmon‘s journey “from egg to store.”</p>
      <p>Marketing materials refer to these tidbits as a “CV,” which will feature the salmon’s origin, how it was farmed, its size upon transference into seawater, as well as the farming facility’s location.</p>
      <p>Health and welfare information will also reportedly be shared, including the salmon’s diet, and even which vaccinations it received.</p>
      <p>Instead of a public ledger, these firms have chosen <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/10/08/ibm-food-blockchain-trust/">IBM Food Trust</a> to manage this data. It’s a specialized software suite for tracking food supply routes with private <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/07/27/distributed-ledger-technology-blockchain/">distributed ledgers</a>.</p>
      <p>IBM built the platform using open source DLT software Hyperledger Fabric, released by the Linux Foundation.</p>

      <p>“This project contributes to reassuring French consumers that the salmon they are purchasing has been farmed in a responsible and sustainable way, is healthy and nutritious, and comes from the beautiful, cold and crisp waters north of the Arctic Circle,” said Cermaq exec Brede Løfsgaard.</p>
      <p>Last week, Hard Fork <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/15/nestle-carrefour-baby-milk-blockchain-ibm-food-trust/">reported</a> that leading food brand Nestlé had joined forces with French retailer Carrefour to put baby milk formula on the blockchain, also using IBM Food Trust.</p>
