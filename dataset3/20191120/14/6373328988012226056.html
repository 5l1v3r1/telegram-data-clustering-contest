      <p>According to reports, the film’s director, Todd Phillips, is likely to reunite with Joaquin Phoenix, with the two reportedly in talks about a sequel.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but Phillips is expected to write the script alongside Scott Silver, who worked on the first movie’s screenplay.</p>

      <p>Warner Bros. is said to already have a sequel option in place for Joaquin Phoenix – who is a strong contender for the ‘Best Actor’ category in next year’s Oscars – and so we can expect him to return as Arthur Fleck.</p>
      <p>Sources told <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> Phillips was initially in discussions with Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich to develop a range of DC characters’ origin stories.</p>
      <p>After pitching the idea in a meeting on October 7 – i.e. immediately after the film’s multi million-dollar opening weekend – it got turned down. However, it’s said he emerged from the meeting with the rights to make one other DC story.</p>

      <p>For those of you wondering what kind of sequel might be in the works, wonder no longer because Phillips has previously hinted at what he might do.</p>

      <p>The director told the <i><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars">Los Angeles Times</a></i> it couldn’t just be ‘this wild and crazy movie’ about the Joker, adding: ‘It would have to have some thematic resonance in a similar way that this does.’</p>
      <p>When you think about the film’s success, it’s really no wonder a follow-up is in the works; <i>Joker</i> was brilliantly received even before its release, receiving an <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/joker-receives-eight-minute-long-standing-ovation-at-venice-film-festival/">eight-minute standing ovation</a> at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
      <p>It soon overtook <i>Deadpool</i> to become <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/joker-becomes-highest-grossing-r-rated-movie-of-all-time/">the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time</a>, and just last week the film <a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/joker-box-office-breaks-1-billion-first-r-rated-movie-in-history-to-do-so/">crossed the $1 billion mark</a> at the worldwide box office, becoming the first R-rated film ever to do so.</p>

      <p>In fact, <i>Joker</i> marks only the fourth DC title to cross the $1 billion mark, following in the footsteps of <i>Aquaman</i> ($1.15 billion), <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i> ($1.08 billion) and <i>The Dark Knight</i> ($1 billion).</p>
      <p>And with a budget of $62.5 million – far less than the prior-mentioned films – <i>Joker</i> has managed to become the most profitable comicbook movie of all time too.</p>
      <p>Making that feat even more impressive is the fact that the film hasn’t even been released in China yet – and doesn’t look set to do so, either – so these statistics are missing from one of the key markets.</p>
