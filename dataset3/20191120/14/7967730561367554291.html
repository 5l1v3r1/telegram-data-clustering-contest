      <h1>Research confirms genes are a major factor in melanoma risk</h1>

      <p>New research has confirmed Aussie kids are at a disadvantage when it comes to the lifetime risk of developing melanoma.</p>
      <p>As part of ongoing genetic research into skin cancer being conducted at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, researchers have identified 22 genes that determine how much sun exposure a person can withstand before they develop the deadly form of skin cancer.</p>

      <p>Catherine Olsen, the project manager of QIMR’s QSkin program, the world’s largest genetic study of skin cancer, said the findings made a clear link between a person’s genetic makeup and the amount of sun their skin could absorb before developing melanoma.</p>
      <p>“We found that for people who had a higher genetic risk, childhood sun exposure seemed to be very important, Dr Olsen said.</p>
      <p>“Whereas people with a low risk seemed to require much more sun exposure before they developed a melanoma.”</p>
      <p>The upshot of that finding is that it confirms what has long been suspected in the medical community - Australian children are at greater risk of getting melanoma simply because they are more frequently exposed to the country’s harsh sunlight.</p>
      <p>Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world, and this research helps shed light on why that is the case, with more than 12,000 Australians diagnosed with invasive melanoma, the most deadly form of the cancer, every year.</p>
      <p>QIMR Berghofer’s cancer control group head and lead researcher David Whiteman said the research confirmed that melanomas developed due to cumulative sun damage.</p>
      <p>“Our data show that people who are born and grow up in Australia have a 50 per cent increased risk of melanomas, while those migrating to Australia as adults, who have the same genes, are less likely to develop the deadly disease,” Professor Whiteman said.</p>
      <p>“This confirms that sun damage up to the age of about 20 is particularly dangerous for people with a higher genetic risk because it’s enough to trigger melanomas and they don’t need long, cumulative exposure as well.”</p>
      <p>Alissa Gordon is a Brisbane mother of two with a family history of melanoma, which makes her especially worried for her five-year-old son Jonty, who has fair skin, red hair and blue eyes - all genetic risk factors for developing skin cancer.</p>

      <p>“When I know he’s going out in the sun I am more strict on him, making sure he’s got sunscreen and a hat on, that he’s got suitable clothing,” Ms Gordon said.</p>
      <p>“[The QIMR research] makes me realise we are at an increased risk, so it makes me more vigilant around how much sun exposure my kids get, and what we do when we’re out in the sun to prevent sun damage.”</p>
      <p>Ms Gordon’s mother has had two melanomas removed, and her mother’s uncle died of melanoma in his 30s.</p>

      <p>Now 39, Ms Gordon recently had a mole removed herself before it could turn into a melanoma, but she said the risk of developing the deadly cancer did not mean her family had to cut short their time in the sun.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it stops us from spending time outside, where just restricted a bit more, we don’t spend hours outside like I did when I was a kid,” she said.</p>
      <p>The research findings have been published in the <i>British Journal of Dermatology</i>.</p>
      <p>QSkin is currently running a recruitment drive to expand its DNA database from the current pool of about 7500 people to 20,000 by this time next year.</p>
      <p>“For genetic studies we need as many people as possible, because the more samples we have the more power we have to find the genes that are important,” Dr Olsen said.</p>
