      <p>Glastonbury co-organiser Emily Eavis said the former Beatle would headline the Pyramid Stage on 27 June - the traditional highlight of the event in Somerset, south-west England.</p>
      <p>"Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true," she said in a statement on the festival website on Monday.</p>
      <p>"There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary." McCartney previously headlined Glastonbury in 2004. This year's headliner was grime star Stormzy.</p>
