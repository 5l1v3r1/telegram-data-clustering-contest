      <p>A Royal Navy ship and her crew are preparing to return to service following an extensive refit at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife.</p>
      <p>Minsweeper HMS Pembroke recently returned to HM Naval Base Clyde and re-joined her six sister vessels.</p>
      <p>On Monday, November 4, a rededication ceremony was held at the Naval Base to mark the milestone and was attended by the Lady Sponsor, Mrs Stephanie Gretton, who launched the ship in Southampton 22 years ago.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gretton, accompanied by her husband retired Vice Admiral Mike Gretton, and other special guests were given a tour of the Sandown-class Mine Counter-Measures Vessel (MCMV), to see for themselves, the hard work that Pembroke and her associated contractors have completed during the maintenance period.</p>

      <p>During the ceremony the Ship’s Company paraded on the jetty in their best uniform and were inspected by the Lady Sponsor. Prayers were then led by Reverend Robert Jackson, before playing the National Anthem and the ceremonial raising of the ensign.</p>
      <p>Able Seaman 2, (Mine Warfare), Euan Dustan (age 21), a crew member onboard HMS Pembroke said: “With HMS Pembroke being my first ship, I felt a great sense of accomplishment and belonging as I took part in the rededication ceremony alongside my crewmates.”</p>
      <p>Also present was Captain Engineering, Captain Camilla Meek who thanked the crew for meeting many demanding deadlines over the previous weeks and months.</p>
      <p>  <br/>Following the ceremony, guests enjoyed a buffet lunch courtesy of HMS Pembroke’s two chefs in the Wardroom. The centre piece of the table was a large cake displaying the ships crest which was cut by the Lady Sponsor and the youngest member of the Ship’s Company, Engineering Technician (Marine Engineer) Darren Hill (age 18).</p>
