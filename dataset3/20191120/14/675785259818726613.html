      <h1>West Ham mock Jose Mourinho ahead of first match in charge of Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has been reminded of his mixed fortunes against West Ham ahead of his first match as Totteham boss this weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:06:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>West Ham have risked the wrath of Jose Mourinho ahead of his return to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been confirmed as Mauricio Pochettino's successor at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and will take charge of his first match on Saturday, the London derby with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Mourinho has a mixed bag of results against the Hammers, losing 3-1 on his last trip to the London Stadium in September 2018.</p>
      <p>West Ham posted a clip of that game and other previous matches against the Portuguese, dating back to his spells with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , alongside the caption: "See you Saturday, Jose".</p>

      <p>The video also features Andy Carroll's header against the Blues, securing a 2-1 win at Upton Park in 2015.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was sent to the stands for his comments to referee Jon Moss at half-time, as his side's woeful title defence continued.</p>
      <p>West Ham also reminded new Spurs boss Mourinho of his comments about them in January 2014.</p>
      <p>Following a 0-0 draw at Stamford Bridge, in which his side had 39 efforts on goal, Mourinho said the Hammers played '19th Century football' under Sam Allardyce.</p>

      <p>"It's very difficult to play a football match where only one team wants to play, very difficult," Mourinho said.</p>
      <p>"A match is about two teams playing. This match was only one team playing and another team not. I told Big Sam that, because they need points, to come here and do it the way they did... is it acceptable? Maybe yes.</p>
      <p>"I cannot be too critical because, if I was in this position, I don't know if I would do the same. But at the same time this is not Premier League. This is not the best league in the world. This is football from the 19th century."</p>
      <p>Tottenham go into Saturday's London derby in 14th, just a point and two places above West Ham, with manager Manuel Pellegrini also under pressure.</p>
