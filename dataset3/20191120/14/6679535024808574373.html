      <p>GHMC Commissioner D.S. Lokesh Kumar has issued orders to officials asking them to inspect the night shelters and provide full-fledged facilities to the homeless and the poor, in view of the dropping temperatures.</p>
      <p>Addressing a video conference with zonal and deputy commissioners and medical officers from GHMC headquarters, Mr. Lokesh Kumar asked them to shift those sleeping on footpaths and near junctions to the shelter homes.</p>
      <p>As of now, 15 night shelters are being run in Hyderabad, where over 600 people have been accommodated. The Commissioner has asked the officials to convert various GHMC community halls to night shelters if need be.</p>
      <p>Noting that the number of beggars near major junctions and traffic signals has increased of late, Mr. Lokesh Kumar asked the officials to take appropriate measures to prevent begging with help from the Police. He also reviewed the upcoming drive for removal of construction waste, and vector control operations, besides others.</p>
