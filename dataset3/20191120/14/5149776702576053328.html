      <h1>Nottingham students reveal what will sway their vote in the general election</h1>
      <h2>"I need to look into it all more before I actually vote, I’ll admit that.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:28:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Gurjeet Nanrah</a></address>
      <p>With more than 60,000 <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">students</a> in the Nottingham area in full-time education, this demographic could have a big say locally in the upcoming general election.</p>
      <p>That is if they choose to register to vote at their term-time addresses, as students are able to register back at their permanent address and wherever they are studying for their degree - it is a criminal offence to vote in more than one place.</p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire Live spoke to some students in the city to find out more about where they plan to vote on December 12 and the big issues swaying their decision.</p>

      <p>Callum Berkinshaw, a 19-year-old international business student at Nottingham Trent University (NTU) from Coventry, said: “A lot of posters and signs are around campus telling us we should now register to vote.</p>
      <p>“I’m registered back home. I know I’ll be back home that close to Christmas.</p>
      <p>“Brexit is a big issue and the NHS. Not everyone is that aware of how certain things could impact them.”</p>
      <p>Another business student at NTU, 19-year-old Zoe Schonn, who is in her second year, added: “I’m registered to vote here and back home in Coventry.</p>
      <p>"I think it’s a good thing that we can register at both because we break up around then so a lot of students will go home. I knew that I’m only allowed to vote in one place though.</p>
      <p>“It’s mostly Brexit influencing my vote too. My mum is from Germany so it’s a big problem for her."</p>

      <p>Another student admitted she has 'not registered yet', but knows she has the option of voting here or back home in Surrey.</p>
      <p>Sarosh Patel, a 19-year-old economics student at the University of Nottingham, added: “For me student finance is a big issue and the need for greater assurances about it all.</p>
      <p>"I didn't know you could only vote in one of the places you've registered though so I'll probably just register back home."</p>
      <p>Emma Cawley, a 19-year-old Criminology student at NTU from Hertfordshire, said: “I have registered back home. I didn’t know you could register in both places to be honest.</p>
      <p>“The environment is a big issue. It’s our future it will impact in that sense and a lot of the older people won’t be around to see the impact of climate change."</p>
      <p>Rosie Soroka, a BA History first year student at NTU from Leeds added: “I’m registered in Nottingham, but agree it’s a good thing to be able to register in both places because students are more likely to move at short notice.</p>
      <p>"It’s sad though because a lot of people at university will just not vote.</p>
      <p>“More money needs to be put into schools too and the scare of the NHS being privatised needs to be stopped because people don't want that.”</p>

      <p>Ed Holderness, 20, and a civil engineering student at NTU from near Watford, spoke honestly and said: "I need to look into it all more before I actually vote, I’ll admit that.”</p>
      <p>Bradley Fox, President of Nottingham Trent Students' Union, said: "In the lead up to the general election, we have been running a high-visibility campaign on campus encouraging students to register to vote at their home and term-time addresses.</p>
      <p>"We have also collaborated with the University of Nottingham Students' Union to create a Nottingham Student Manifesto, which we hope will put student-related issues on the agenda of election candidates."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the University of Nottingham's Students' Union said: "We believe that it is of great importance that students exercise their democratic rights. We are using our physical, social, and online channels to raise awareness of the voter registration deadline.</p>
      <p>"The choice is down to students as to where they vote; our message reminds students that they can register at both their home and term time addresses but that they can only vote from one of them."</p>
