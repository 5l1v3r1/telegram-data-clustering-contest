      <p>Cape Town - It’s been a year since Motswako rapper Jabulani 'HHP' Tsambo died.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week Jabba was trending on social media after two of the late rappers' friends shared a picture of his grave site. What caught fans attention the most was the non-existing tombstone on Jabba’s grave.</p>
      <p>Tweeps even went as far as accusing HHP's wife Lerato of neglecting the late rappers grave.</p>

      <p>The 37-year-old saw the tweets and responded – explaining that she doesn't need a crowd fund, she can afford to erect a tombstone for her husband.</p>
      <p>"No need to crowd fund. I can afford to erect a Stone for my husband. If I was allowed to!!! Infact I would have had it done on the same day as his funeral. But Ke [sic]," she tweeted.</p>
