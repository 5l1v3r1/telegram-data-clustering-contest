      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday he had never seen any evidence of Russian interference in any British democracy.</p>
      <p>“There’s absolutely no evidence that I’ve ever seen of any Russian interference in UK democratic processes,” Johnson said when asked about the decision not to publish a parliamentary report on alleged Russian meddling.</p>
      <p>“And as for that particular report I saw no reason whatever to change to timetable for publication just because there was a general election going on,” Johnson said.</p>
