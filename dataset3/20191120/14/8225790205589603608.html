      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - The <b>flash flood watch </b>remains in effect for all of the main Hawaiian Islands through 6 a.m. Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The airmass will stabilize Wednesday with trade winds building back in. Trades will strengthen and become windy Thursday through the weekend.</p>
      <p>The upper low will move northeast of the state and will be replaced by more stable zonal flow aloft.</p>
      <p>Trade winds will also strengthen as the surface trough weakens and a new surface high builds in north of the area. Winds will focus incoming clouds and showers over windward and mauka areas.</p>
      <p>Trade winds will become strong by Thursday into the weekend as the surface high moves northeast of Hawaii and strengthens.</p>
      <p>A long-period northwest swell arriving Wednesday afternoon will require a high surf advisory for exposed shores of most islands through Thursday.</p>
      <p>Surf could approach the 25-foot threshold for <b>high surf warning</b> along north-facing shores.</p>
      <p>Another northwest swell arriving this weekend may also require a high surf advisory.</p>
