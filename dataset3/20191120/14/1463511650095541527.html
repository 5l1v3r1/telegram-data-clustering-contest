      <h1>Hate Speech: Lawmaker disagrees with death penalty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:28:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>A member of the House of Representatives, Hon. James Faleke, has disagreed with the death sentence for hate speech as proposed by a bill currently before the Senate.</p>
      <p>In an interview with journalists on Wednesday in Abuja, Faleke, said though that there was need to curb hate speech, the death penalty was, however, taking it to the extreme.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker, who represents Ikoyi Federal Constituency of Lagos State, however, threw his weight behind the death penalty for terrorism and kidnapping.</p>
      <p>“It is the area of punishment that we should be concerned about, for me; I think we need to have a law on hate speech because it can cause war, crisis and disharmony in the country.</p>
      <p>“Your right to free speech must be within the ambit of the law to bring harmony and good relationship among the people.</p>
      <p>“But I will not support a death penalty for hate speech; for kidnapping and terrorism, I support death sentence as passed by some state assemblies,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Hate Speech Bill, which passed first reading last week at the Senate, was sponsored by the Deputy Chief Whip, Senator Sabi Abdullahi.</p>
      <p>Abdullahi said it was the judge that should determine the punishment for offenders if the bill was passed into law.</p>
      <p>He said as far as the issue of death by hanging was concerned, as spelt out in Section 33 of the Constitution, it must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
      <p>Acting Spokesperson for the Senate, Senator Godiya Akwashiki, had said that when the bill got to second reading, senators would be given the opportunity to speak on the matter.</p>
      <p>Akwashiki said the upper chamber of the National Assembly would scrutinise the bill to remove whatever they perceived offensive and insert what would protect the interest of Nigerians. </p>
