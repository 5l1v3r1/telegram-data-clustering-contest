      <p>A woman in Australia saved a crying koala from a bush fire by taking her shirt off and scooping the whimpering animal up with it, away from the scorching flames.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IAOWaIbnE4">9News Sydney</a> named the woman who rescued the koala as Toni Doherty.</p>
      <p>Doherty told 9News she was passing by the area when she saw the animal and acted on instinct to save him.</p>
      <p>“I knew if we didn’t get him down from the tree then he would have been up there in amongst the flames,” she told 9News.</p>
      <p>Footage of the full rescue can be seen below.</p>

      <p>In the video, Doherty rushes towards the koala and picks him up with her own t-shirt.</p>
      <p>The koala is removed from a tree branch and appears to be very badly burned, with scabs all over its body.</p>
      <p>Doherty then gives the koala water to drink and washes his body before wrapping him up in a blanket.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in Port Macquarie, a town in New South Wales that has been hit badly by the recent bushfires in Australia .</p>
      <p>The koala, who Doherty <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IAOWaIbnE4">named Lewis</a> after her grandson was taken to the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital.</p>
      <p>9News reporter Lizzie Pearl said in a tweet that Lewis is suffering from serious burns but was well enough to “have a munch on some eucalyptus leaves” on Wednesday.</p>
