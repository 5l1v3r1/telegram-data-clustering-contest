      <h1>The price of this stunning LG 4K TV continues to fall</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:52:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/joseph-green/" target="_blank">Joseph Green</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> The <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b8mi">LG 49-inch Smart 4K Ultra HD HDR LED TV</a> is on sale for £499 on Currys PC World, saving you £150 on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Currys PC World can't always compete with the likes of Amazon when it comes to price, but it does offer a selection of extras that tempt many shoppers.</p>
      <p>For starters, anyone purchasing the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b8mi">LG 49-inch Smart 4K Ultra HD HDR LED TV</a> from Currys PC World will get the benefit of a five-year guarantee for added peace of mind. That's not all though, because you can also get a Google Nest Mini for only £10 and a free six-month Spotify Premium streaming subscription when you buy this TV. Amazon does not offer these things.</p>
      <p>All of this would be reason for most shoppers to consider investing in this device, but on this occasion the price also competes with Amazon. Very recently this model was on sale for £599 on Currys, but has dropped once again to just £499. This deal now saves you £150 on list price.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b8mi">LG 49-inch Smart 4K Ultra HD HDR LED TV</a> offers NanoCell technology for enhanced colour and wider viewing angles, with cinematic sound thanks to Dolby Atmos. You also get catch-up TV and 4K streaming. It's a seriously impressive model, with all the bells and whistles.</p>
      <p>Get more for your money with Currys PC World.</p>
