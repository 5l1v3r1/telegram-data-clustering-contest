      <h1>Pak's 16-year-old to make Test debut against Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:23:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Teenage bowling sensation Naseem Shah will become one of the youngest cricketers to play a Test after Pakistan captain Azhar Ali confirmed on Wednesday that the 16-year-old will make his debut at the Gabba.</p>
      <p>Shah, who opted to remain on tour after his mother died last week, made the grade for Thursday's first Test after impressing with an eight-over spell against Australia A in Perth.</p>
      <p>"We are definitely looking to play him -- he is bowling really well," Azhar said ahead of the series opener in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Only handful of players have made their debut aged 16, including Sachin Tendulkar who went on to become an Indian batting legend.</p>
      <p>The youngest Test player is listed by Cricinfo as Pakistan's Hasan Raza, who was 14 on his 1996 debut, though his date of birth was later disputed</p>
      <p>Azhar said he had faith in Shah's abilities through a high-pressure five-day game.</p>
      <p>"He's very fit, I have captained him in first-class matches and he has overs under his belt," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure that he can do that in Test matches as well, I have no doubts in his fitness and his bowling skills.</p>
      <p>"Not many players can reach that standard so early but there are exceptions and he's one of them," he added. "We are all looking forward to him having a very successful career."</p>
      <p>Pakistan have a history of blooding promising players early, accounting for six of the 10 youngest to play Test matches.</p>
      <p>But Naseem, who has only played seven first-class games, is also carrying the huge extra burden of his mother passing away.</p>
      <p>Pakistan great Wasim Akram said if someone was good enough, then age did not come into it.</p>
      <p>"I think it's a blessing in disguise because when you're 16-17, you don't even know what the word pressure means," Akram told Fox Sports Australia. "You just want to go out and play.</p>
      <p>"When I was 17, I didn't know what pressure meant, I was loving it. I think the same goes for Naseem. When he becomes a star he'll know what pressure means. At this age he'll just be raring to go."</p>
      <p>Pakistan also have two 19-year-old fast bowlers in Musa Khan and Shaheen Afridi and Azhar said they were taking a fearless attitude into the two-match series in Australia.</p>
      <p>"We have the talent to potentially do well here," he said.</p>
      <p>"We come with fresh faces and a new look to the Test team and we are very confident that if we execute our skills, we have the potential to beat Australia.</p>
      <p>"To do that we have to just keep believing and play with no fear."</p>
