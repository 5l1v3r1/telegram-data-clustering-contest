      <p>A mother has admitted letting her two year-old daughter drown in the bath before dissolving the child’s body in acid.</p>
      <p>Monica Dominguez, 38, was jailed for 20 years Friday, nine months after Rebecka Zavala’s remains were found at a container at their apartment in Laredo, Texas.</p>
      <p>Dominguez then admitted to a police officer that she’d left Rebecca and her other child in the bath unsupervised just before the tragedy.</p>
      <p>She told them how she and her husband Gerardo Zavala-Loredo, 33, put Rebecka in the five gallon container before covering her corpse with corrosive fluid.</p>
      <p>Police have been unable to determine if that story is true – and rule out foul play as a cause of Rebecka’s death – because the little girl’s remains were so badly damaged by the acid.</p>

      <p>Zavala-Loredo has struck a plea deal which will see him jailed for 14 years for tampering with evidence of a human corpse.</p>
      <p>The couple’s four other children, aged one to 11, have been taken into care by social services, the <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/local/crime/article/Laredo-woman-found-guilty-of-dissolving-child-s-14842832.php#photo-16934042">Laredo Morning Times</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Dominguez was jailed for a further 10 years in February this year for violating probation over a previous child abuse charge.</p>
      <p>Her then nine month-old son suffered six fractures – two on his right arm, and two on each leg – in September 2015.</p>
      <p>Both Dominguez and Zavala-Loredo denied harming their son, with Dominguez handed 10 years probation over the boy’s injuries.</p>
