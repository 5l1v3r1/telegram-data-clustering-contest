      <p>A reality star dance teacher has admitted raping one of his students and exposing the youngster to HIV.</p>
      <p>John Conner III, 30, met the 16 year-old online in 2015, and met up on several occasions to have unprotected sex in his car.</p>
      <p>They exchanged texts about their encounters and sent nude photos, with the boy later joining Conner’s dance team, the Infamous Dancettes.</p>
      <p>Conner, of Memphis in Tennessee, also failed to disclose that he was HIV positive to the boy.</p>
      <p>It was only several months after they’d first had sex that the boy learned Conner had HIV from someone else.</p>

      <p>The boy had a HIV test, which came back positive, <a href="https://www.wmcactionnews5.com/2019/11/19/reality-tv-dance-teacher-pleads-guilty-hiv-sex-charges-involving-teen-student/">WMC5</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Conner, who appeared in Lifetime’s reality show Bring It, was arrested and charged with criminal exposure to HIV, statutory rape and solicitation of a minor.</p>
      <p>The age of consent in Tennessee is 18 years-old.</p>
      <p>He admitted the charges against him just as his trial was due to begin.</p>
      <p>The dance teacher, whose TV appearance saw his dance squad compete against other teams, has two similar cases pending against partners aged 17 and 24.</p>
      <p>He will be sentenced for raping the 16 year-old on December 20.</p>
