      <p>LONDON, Nov 20 — Stevenage caretaker manager and former England Women head coach Mark Sampson was today charged by the Football Association over using allegedly racist language.</p>
      <p>Sampson, who took interim charge of the club, who play in English football’s fourth tier, in September, is accused of making the remark about a player during a conversation about transfer targets.</p>
      <p>The FA said he had been charged with an “aggravated” breach of Rule E3 and has until December 6 to respond.</p>
      <p>Stevenage said in September that an internal investigation into the matter had found there was no case for Sampson to answer.</p>
      <p>The club said at the time that the allegation was reported to the FA by phone “by a former coach the day after he was told by Sampson that he no longer required his services at the club”.</p>
      <p>Sampson, 37, was sacked as England Women head coach by the FA in September 2017 following allegations of “inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour” in his previous role as manager at Bristol Academy.</p>
      <p>He had also been the focus of bullying and racism claims, first made by Eni Aluko and then Drew Spence.</p>
      <p>The FA said the allegations were investigated and Sampson was cleared of any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>But Sampson, who reached a financial settlement with the FA over his dismissal, conceded he should have handled the claims differently, saying it would always be a “big regret” and apologising unreservedly to the two players. — AFP</p>
