      <h1>Chilling warning over children wearing winter coats in car as parents shown harrowing dangers</h1>
      <h2>Crash tests have proved how a child dummy would come hurtling out of the seat in a simulated 30mph crash</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:41:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Emma Gill, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Parents have been reminded over the danger of children wearing winter coats in the car.</p>
      <p>As the weather turns, mums and dads will be wrapping their little ones up all snug and warm - especially if they're heading off out for the day.</p>
      <p>But crash tests have proved how a child dummy would come hurtling out of the seat in a simulated 30mph crash, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/parenting/winter-coats-car-seat-danger-17282398">M.E.N</a> .</p>
      <p>Safety experts have produced a video to highlight the risk and explain why wearing a coat presents such a risk.</p>
      <p>The Good Egg Safety video shows a boy being strapped in a seat while wearing his coat.</p>
      <p>When he takes the coat off and puts the straps back on, they are loose.</p>

      <p>Margaret Bolt, Good Egg Safety car seat expert, says: "Without adjusting the harness and doing the buckle back up, you can see how much movement there is in those straps and how much slack there in fact still is.</p>
      <p>"Now if they wear a winter coat in a car seat and the car is involved in a crash, all the padding in the coat will be compressed and effectively this is how loose the straps are and the child could be ejected from the seat."</p>
      <p>Instead of wearing a coat parents and carers are encouraged to strap children in and either put the coat or a blanket over the child to keep them warm.</p>
      <p>The advice applies to adults too with experts saying they shouldn't wear a winter coat when behind the wheel or riding in a car.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Julie Dagnall, of Leyland-based Child Seat Safety Ltd, said: "As winter is approaching, it’s very tempting to wrap our children up in big warm coats in the car, but this can stop the harness or shield from fitting across the child correctly and can mean that the child could be ejected from their car seat in a collision.</p>
      <p>"It’s always best to remember to have indoor clothes on in the car, with the harness tight and fastened as close to the skin as possible.</p>
      <p>"If you think they’ll be cold, place a blanket or their coat on top of them. Just check it doesn't stop the car seat from working properly and isn't going to make them overheat especially if they are young babies."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Nick Lloyd, road safety manager at RoSPA, agreed, adding: "I f a child is wearing a thick jacket or bodysuit the harness cannot be firmly fastened around the child meaning that it will not fit in the right place and importantly it will not be close enough to the child’s body.</p>
      <p>"In an accident the harness will need to compress the jacket before it can restrain the child.</p>
      <p>"This reduces the safety of the seat considerably and therefore it is not recommended that thick jackets or bodysuits are worn."</p>
