      <h1>ABC Renews All 6 of Its Retro Game Shows</h1>
      <h2>The rookies 'Press Your Luck' and 'Card Sharks' and four veteran series are all on tap to return in 2020.</h2>

      <p>ABC is not letting its "Summer Fun and Games" end anytime soon.</p>
      <p>The network has renewed all six of its retro game shows for new seasons in 2020. The rookies <i>Press Your Luck</i> and <i>Card Sharks</i> will return for their second seasons, <i>Celebrity Family Feud</i> for its sixth and <i>The $100,000 Pyramid, Match Game</i> and <i>To Tell the Truth</i> for their fifth.</p>
      <p>ABC's Wednesday and Sunday game show blocks put up solid ratings during summer. The network finished first or second among adults 18-49 each week the <i>Press Your Luck-Card Sharks-Match Game</i> lineup aired, and the Sunday shows have combined to lead their night in the 18-49 demo for the majority of the summer.</p>
      <p>For the summer as a whole, ABC finished tied for first in adults 18-49 with NBC, the first time it has finished in the top spot since 1995.</p>
      <p>"Summer has become synonymous with ABC’s 'Fun &amp; Games' brand," Rob Mills, senior vp alternative series, specials and late night at ABC, said Wednesday in a statement. "To have these shows return is a testament to their strength, and the excitement and fun they bring each week. These are legit star-studded shows that celebrate everything we love about the spirit of competition. Thanks to them and <i>The Bachelorette</i>, we dominated summer and are doubling down on next year."</p>
      <p>Game shows and competitions have proven to be a strong blueprint for ABC in the summer. The strategy in a time when TV usage is down is to make "joinable" shows, executive vp programming strategy Andy Kubitz <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/summer-peak-tv-era-originals-explode-1221024">told <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>: "If you turn [a show] on in the middle, you can still keep watching. It's fun, it's not too heavy."</p>
      <p>ABC earlier renewed the mini-golf competition <i>Holey Moley. </i>The network has not yet made a decision on its other summer originals, the culinary competition <i>Family Food Fight</i> or the scripted drama <i>Reef Break</i>.</p>
      <p><i>The $100,000 Pyramid</i> is produced by SMAC Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures TV. <i>Card Sharks, Celebrity Family Feud, Match Game, Press Your Luck</i> and <i>To Tell the Truth</i> all come from Fremantle.</p>
