      <p>When the franchise reached its end, Stewart returned to the independent film scene, earning acclaim for her roles in dramas such as “Clouds of Sils Maria,” “Camp X-Ray,” and “Still Alice.”</p>
      <p>Recently, Stewart starred in the box-office film <a href="https://www.insider.com/kristen-stewart-says-she-wasnt-rehired-snow-white-sequel-because-of-slut-shaming-2019-11">“Charlie’s Angels.”</a></p>

      <p>In between filming the “Twilight” movies, he starred in several romantic dramas like “Water for Elephants” and “Remember Me.”</p>
      <p>Pattinson has continued working in dramas in the years since, with “Good Time” and “Damsel.” He’s also <a href="https://www.insider.com/robert-pattinson-will-play-batman-2019-5">set to play Batman in the next DC Comics film.</a></p>
