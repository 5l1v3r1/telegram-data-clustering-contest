      <h1>Twitter censures UK Tory Party for changing its blue-check account name to "FactCheckUK" during the prime ministerial debates</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:14:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>The UK is having an election in less than a month, and last night, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn debated Tory archclown Boris Johnson for a televised debate in which Johnson had to defend his record as a lying, racist, philandering, cowardly failure of a human being, and of a leader to his party and the nation.</p>
      <p>During the debates, the @CCHQPress Twitter account -- which has a Twitter "blue check" indicating that its identity has been verified by the company -- changed its screen name to "FactCheckUK," a name very similar to the existing UK impartial fact-checking service "FactCheck." Having done so, the account emitted a stream of calumnies and falsehoods about the Labour Party, all appearing under the "verified" FactCheckUK by-line.</p>
      <p>Twitter has publicly characterised the move as "[an attempt] to mislead people by editing verified profile information" and has sworn that any repeat of this stunt or similar moves by the Tory party will lead to "decisive corrective action."</p>
      <p>Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly insists that there was nothing wrong with his party's actions.</p>
      <blockquote>"It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate," said Full Fact, an independent British fact-checking charity in a post. "Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service." <br/><br/>Twitter has a policy against impersonation that states: "Twitter accounts that pose as another person, brand, or organization in a confusing or deceptive manner may be permanently suspended under Twitter's impersonation policy." <br/><br/>Britain's Labour Party joined the wave of criticism saying, "Conservatives' laughable attempt to dupe those watching the #ITVDebate by renaming their twitter account shows you can't trust a word they say," the party tweeted from its official account.</blockquote>
