        <b>A new plan has proposed that would see the Leap Card phased out.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new technology will first be tested on urban bus routes, with contactless payments set to replace the travel cards.</p>
      <p>The National Transport Authority will engage with service providers with the goal of integrating its new "next-generation ticketing" system by 2027.</p>
      <p>The system will allow passengers to pay in a number of ways, including through mobile phones, bank cards and official identification cards.</p>
      <p>The plans would also allow for anonymised payments through QR codes and electronic tokens.</p>
      <p>The NTA said the new measures would eliminate the need for interaction between the passenger and driver, meaning payment deals are cut.</p>
      <p>Processing of payments at bus stops is the second biggest source of delays, with 20% of passengers still paying in cash.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, when passengers are using Leap Cards they normally must discuss their destination with the driver, a cause of further delays.</p>
      <p>An NTA spokesperson said: “Even with Leap Card, the complexity of stages means a large percentage of passengers have to interact with the driver with resultant delays at bus stops due to the fact that the NTA does not currently have a flat fare and operates a tag-on only system."</p>
