      <p>Zimbabwean riot police fired tear gas and beat opposition supporters on Wednesday after barring a planned address by the main opposition leader, Nelson Chamisa, AFP journalists said.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of supporters had gathered outside the headquarters in Harare of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after the party was denied permission to hold a rally in the city’s Africa Unity Square.</p>
      <p>Chamisa had been expected to make the address from the office balcony instead.</p>
      <p>As the crowd danced to party songs blaring from speakers on the balcony, baton-wielding police arrived to disperse them.</p>
      <p>An AFP correspondent saw a man with a bleeding gash on the head and a swollen arm after being hit with a truncheon as he left a food outlet.</p>
      <p>Several shops and banks yanked down their shutters.</p>
      <p>“Many people were beaten up and injured,” MDC spokesman Daniel Molokele told AFP. “We condemn the police brutality in the strongest terms”.</p>
      <p>He said Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government was as oppressive as the regime of the man he had ousted, former president Robert Mugabe.</p>
      <p>“It’s the same old regime. Worse than Smith,” he said referring to Ian Smith, the white-minority prime minister of the 1960s and 70s, who declared independence in defiance of Britain, the country’s colonial power.</p>
      <p>“Maybe they are afraid that what they did to Mugabe in November 2017 will repeat itself,” said a man wearing a red MDC beret who identified himself as Terry T, referring to the military-led coup against Mugabe two years ago.</p>
      <p>Chamisa had been expected to speak about the general state of the country including its entrenched economic crisis, corruption and crumbling health system.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe’s economy, crippled by decades of mismanagement under Mugabe, has failed to rebound under Mnangagwa, and many Zimbabweans say the situation has got worse.</p>
      <p>Hyperinflation is wiping out savings; unemployment is estimated at around 90 percent; fuel, medicine and other essentials are in short supply; and doctors and some public-sector workers have stopped going to work as they cannot afford the cost of commuting.</p>
      <p>Many families live on one meal a day.</p>
