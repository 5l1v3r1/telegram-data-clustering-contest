          <p>During the 21st match of the ongoing Marsh Cup between Tasmania and New South Wales in Hobart, New South Wales fielders Jason Sangha and Harry Conway ended up making a mess of a simple chance as they gave a reprieve to Tasmania all-rounder Simon Milenko.</p>
          <p>After New South Wales captain Peter Neville won the toss and put the hosts in to bat, his bowlers backed his decision by reducing Tasmania to 53/4 in the 13rd over. Just when Tasmania needed some luck on their side, No. 6 batsman Milenko was at the receiving end of the same.</p>

                      <p>After Milenko’s attempt of pulling a McAndrew delivery saw him mis-timing a ball in between mid-on and mid-wicket, it was not caught by either of Sangha (mid-wicket) or Conway (mid-on). While Sangha slipped midway while reaching to the ball, Conway ended up dropping a sitter.</p>
                      <p>Milenko eventually got out in the 23rd over but after scoring 25 (36) with the help of three fours. No. 4 batsman Macalister Wright top-scored with 104 (118) with the help of eight fours and four sixes to power Tasmania to 251/9 in 50 overs.</p>

                          <p>Chasing a 252-run target, New South Wales were bundled out for 131 in 32.3 overs. Sangha, who came in to bat at No. 6 in the 12th over, top-scored for the visitors with 23 (26) with the help of three fours. Tasmania pacer Jackson Bird (10-3-25-6) registered career-best bowling figures in a match-winning effort.</p>
