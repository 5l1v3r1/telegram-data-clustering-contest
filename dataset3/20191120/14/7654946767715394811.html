      <p>Former Malaga striker Sergio Contreras Pardo, known as Koke, has reportedly been arrested after cops confiscated a ton of hashish as part of an alleged drug trafficking ring.</p>
      <p>EuroWeekly claims, as first reported by ElConfidencial, that the Guardia Civil carried out 11 raids involving a total of 150 officers as part of a major operation across Spain.</p>
      <p>Koke, 36, was cuffed with his brother at his home in Estepona, with local reports alleging he is one of the leaders of the drug trafficking criminal network.</p>
      <p>In total, 20 people were arrested in different parts of Andalusia, including detainees in Malaga, Estepona, the Granada town of Loja, and the Sevillian cities of Los Molares and Utrera.</p>
      <p>The raids have been reported to have uncovered “significant amounts of cash”, as well as weapons and a ton of hashish, which is cannabis resin.</p>
      <p>Koke came through the ranks at his hometown club Malaga, scoring on his debut, before embarking on a much-traveled career. He had spells at Marseille, Sporting Lisbon, and Houston Dynamo in the MLS before spending his final years playing in India and then returning to Estepona.</p>
      <p>But Koke was best known for his tenure at Greek outfit Aris, where he spent six years over two separate spells in Thessaloniki.</p>
      <p>It was for the Super League side that the striker even enjoyed a brief cameo against Manchester City, in a 3-0 defeat during the Europa League round-of-32 in 2011.</p>
      <p>On that day, Edin Dzeko netted twice in the opening 15 minutes before Yaya Toure scored a third, with Koke emerging from the bench during the second half.</p>
