      <h1>Kodak Black Might Have Genius Plan To Leave Prison Early</h1>

      <p>Florida rapper <b>Kodak Black</b> might get out of prison sooner than his recent sentence. New reports claim the hip-hop artist is trying to get into a rehab program behind bars.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the program <a href="https://www.vibe.com/2019/11/kodak-black-hopes-to-combine-rehab-with-prison-sentence">could ultimately shed time</a> off his nearly four-year bid.</p>
      <blockquote>Completing the 500-hour program could shorten the rapper’s prison sentence by up to a year, but there’s an obstacle standing in his way. The request may get denied if Kodak is charged for a drug-induced fight with a fellow inmate last month. A prison guard tried to break up the melee and Kodak allegedly grabbed his testicles so tightly that he required medical attention. Kodak’s lawyer claims that his client was drugged leading up to the altercation. (VIBE)</blockquote>
      <p>Recently, rap stars <b>Gucci Mane</b> and <b>Kevin Gates</b> <a href="https://www.sohh.com/gucci-mane-pulls-for-kodak-blacks-freedom-w-shirtless-throwback-pic-free-kodak/">shared encouraging words</a> about wanting Black out of prison.</p>

      <p>A few days ago, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/kodak-black-hit-w-more-charges-now-faces-up-to-30-years-in-prison/">reports surfaced about</a> KB getting hit with more weapons charges.</p>
      <blockquote>Days after Kodak Black was sentenced to 46 months in federal prison, state prosecutors have slapped the rapper with additional weapons charges. The Miami-Dade State Attorney’s office on Friday formally charged the 22-year-old with two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. He faces up to 30 years in prison on each count as a “habitual violent offender.” (Miami Herald)</blockquote>
      <p>Last Wednesday, <a href="https://www.sohh.com/breaking-kodak-black-sentenced-to-nearly-4-years-in-prison-on-weapons-charges/">a Miami federal judge sentenced</a> the 22-year-old to 46 months in prison.</p>
      <blockquote>The state had asked for 46 to 57 months, while Black’s lawyers had urged for 37 to 44 months or less, court records show. Black, 22, had pleaded guilty in August to lying on a background form when he purchased handguns at a Hialeah weapons store in January, and again in March when he attempted to buy more guns. He also ran into trouble during his stint behind bars while awaiting sentencing. During the court hearing, prosecutors revealed that Black had beat up a prison guard. (Miami Herald)</blockquote>
