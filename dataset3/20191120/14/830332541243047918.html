      <p>BARNEVELD - Thomas Noel Tomaw of Barneveld died Saturday, Nov. 16, 2019, at UW Hospital in Madison following a courageous battle with anaplastic thyroid cancer. He was 76 years old.</p>
      <p>Tom was born on Feb. 10, 1943, in Paris, Ill., a son of the late Wayne and Lois (Claypool) Tomaw.</p>
      <p>He graduated from Brocton High School in 1961. He and his wife of 54 years, Phyllis JoAnn (Price), were married on July 24, 1965. She survives.</p>
      <p>Tom was a devoted husband, father and grandfather, as well as an active and respected member of his community and the livestock industry where he made and maintained multiple friendships.</p>
      <p>Growing up on the family farm, Tom helped raise and exhibit Angus cattle, sparking a life-long love of the cattle industry. His passion flourished when the couple moved to Wisconsin in 1969 to manage a purebred Charolais operation for Alex and Marty Stauffer. During his tenure, Tom helped guide Silver Creek to great success, earning it a reputation as one of the most successful cattle businesses in North America. Over the next 20 years, Tom and the Silver Creek team exhibited cattle across the continent. Silver Creek won multiple state, national and international competitions including being the only farm to win back-to-back national champion bull honors.</p>
      <p>Following the dispersal of Silver Creek in 1991, Tom and Phyllis started Tomaw Angus. Tomaw Angus was smaller scale than Silver Creek, but the quality of the cattle was still very important to Tom. Tom's sales skills turned global when they sold a group of heifer calves to Australia. Tomaw Angus also allowed Tom to pursue other activities for which he had a passion</p>
      <p>Tom was also a respected cattle judge, overseeing a number of shows including at the National Western Stock Show in Denver, Colo.</p>
      <p>He was a former president of the Wisconsin Angus Association as well as a former president of the Iowa County Cattleman's Association, being named the organization's Cattleman of the Year in 2006. He was also a board member of the Wisconsin Beef Improvement Association and on the executive committee of the Wisconsin Beef Expo.</p>
      <p>In addition to the cattle business, Tom was a former president of the Barneveld School Board and had served on the Barneveld-Brigham Fire Rescue Board.</p>
      <p>He enjoyed spending time and visiting with friends and family and was fond of celebrating the holidays where he was known for making his oyster dressing at Thanksgiving and divinity candy at Christmas. His granddaughters were among his biggest joys.</p>
      <p>In addition to his wife, Phyllis, Tom is survived by a son, Michael (Laura) Tomaw of Michigan; a daughter, Deborah (Michael) Igl of Antigo; twin granddaughters, Alexandria (Abbie Green) Tomaw of Alabama and Claire Tomaw of Missouri; a sister, Sheree (Donnie) Blanton; sisters and brothers-in-law, Lila Tomaw, Cheryl Tomaw, Elwyn Price, Ed (Liz) Price and Melissa (Chuck) Eldridge; and many nieces and nephews. Tom was preceded in death by his parents; two brothers, Charles and James; in-laws, Elton and Jewel Price; a sister-in-law, Patricia Shew; a brother-in-law, Marvin Shew; and a nephew.</p>
      <p>Funeral services will be held at 2 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 23, 2019, at the GAFFNEY CATTLE SALES FACILITY, 4888 County Road HH, Barneveld, with interment to follow Sunday, Nov. 24, 2019, at the White Church Cemetery in Barneveld.</p>
      <p>Visitation will be on Saturday from 10 a.m. until the time of services at the sales facility. Parking will be limited and the family asks that as many people as possible use the shuttles that will be located at the Barneveld Lutheran Church parking lot, 505 Swiss Lane, Barneveld.</p>
      <p>The family would like to give special thanks to Scott and Val and the entire Gaffney family, as well as all of the nurses and staff who cared for Tom at UW Hospital.</p>
