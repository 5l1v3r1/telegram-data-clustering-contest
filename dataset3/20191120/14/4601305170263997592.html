      <p>There are so many retro-themed merch options out there, but I'm tickled blue by Rhayader Computers's mouse mat designs showing <a href="https://www.rhayadercomputers.co.uk/c64_mouse_mat/p4866955_17582544.aspx">BASIC interpreters from classic 8-bit computers</a>. It seems only the C64 and Amstrad CPC are thusly honored, but there's lots of other well-chosen designs to pick from.</p>
