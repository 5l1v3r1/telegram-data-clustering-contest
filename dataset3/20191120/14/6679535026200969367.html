      <p>Hilda Rayappan, head of Prajna Counselling Centre, on Wednesday stressed the need for a dedicated counselling and rehabilitation centre for drug addicts in the city.</p>
      <p>She was speaking at a meeting convened by the District Legal Services Authority for implementing its plans chaired by Principal District and Sessions Judge Kadlur Satyanaranacharya here. Ms. Rayappan noted that drug addicts are being admitted to rehabilitation centres meant for alcoholics.</p>
      <p>However, addiction to drugs and alcohol are completely different and they need different kinds of treatment. Moreover, there is a need for a centre to free adolescents, who are falling victim in large numbers, from drug addiction, she said.</p>
      <h3>Awareness programme</h3>
      <p>Earlier, Mr. Satyanarayanacharya said that the Legal Services Authority would conduct awareness programmes on drug abuse in colleges and professional educational institutions.</p>
      <p>He said that of late, the youth in the district are becoming victims of drug abuse, which is a serious cause for concern. This would severely affect the image of the district which is known for quality education and parents may hesitate sending their wards to institutions here. As such, everyone should treat the issue seriously and work towards eradicating the menace.</p>
      <p>Complimenting the police for acting tough against drug abuse, Mr. Satyanarayanacharya urged the department to counsel parents of young drug addicts.</p>
      <p>The judge said that the Legal Services Authority has various programmes lined up in the coming days, including legal awareness, for the crew of private buses, awareness programmes on bonded labour, HIV Day, Human Rights Day.</p>
