      <h1>2019 LA Auto Show: Aston Martin DBX SUV debuts, its first-ever five-seater</h1>

      <p>Aston Martin, the storied British sports and GT carmaker has firmly established itself in the SUV race with this, the Aston Martin DBX. The brand's first-ever five-seater, the DBX is also based on a completely new SUV architecture that will spawn a range of models.</p>

      <p>The styling is still unmistakably Aston. The front is dominated by the signature grille, but adds slightly smaller lamps and big functional bumper inserts. The soft contours are still evident throughout the body while the signature fender-cut is also present. Other touches are the frameless doors, the exaggerated coupe shape with the extended C-pillar and the upswept decked bootlid, all reminiscent of the brand's sports cars. All the elements right from the front ducts to the spoiler have been developed to be aerodynamically efficient.</p>

      <p>The interiors are done up in wood, composite and metal veneers with special attention to space for all body types and sizes, the subtle glass touches also remain. Materials like one based on wool and others processed from flax are used to replace carbon-fibre trim. The front seats have been derived from the brand's sports cars but new features like a bridged centre console, a 12.3-inch instrument cluster, a 10.25-inch central screen, full-length panoramic sunroof with an Alcantara cover, 360-degree camera and a two-zone 64-colour ambient light. Aston Martin claims special attention has been paid to make the cabin as airy and spacious as possible. The DBX will also be available with special use packages for buyers with different needs and a full suite of assistance and safety systems. Boot space is 632 litres.</p>

      <p>The DBX's new architecture uses a bonded aluminium construction, like its other cars, for lightness and strength. The Aston SUV weighs 2,245kg and features tech like a three-chamber air-suspension system and a 48v electric anti-roll control system. This can raise ride height by 45mm or lower it by 50mm for use in a range of off-road and dynamic situations. The DBX continues to use the Mercedes-sourced 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 as seen on the Vantage and DB11. Here it has been specifically tuned to make 550PS and 700Nm. It pairs with a 9-speed torque-converter, again Mercedes tech, to get the DBX from 0 to 100kmph in 4.5s and up to a top speed of 291kmph. There is also an AWD system and an active centre differential and an electronically limited rear differential.</p>

      <p>The Aston Martin DBX will cost around Rs 1.5 crore before options and duties when it debuts internationally before June 2020. Expect the DBX to make it to India soon after that.</p>
