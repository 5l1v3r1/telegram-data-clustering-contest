        <b>Barry Hearn says the British Darts Organisation (BDO) need to stop trying to compete with the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) because the ‘world moves on.’</b>
      </p>
      <p>The two sides of the split in darts were brought together for their annual clash at the Grand Slam of Darts last week, and Hearn says it has inspired the PDC to re-evaluate the selection process for the tournament.</p>
      <p>The BDO admitted that the selections they put forward to compete in the Grand Slam did not make it into the event, although the PDC chairman’s comments suggest they may not be getting any picks in the future.</p>
      <p>‘It won’t surprise you to know its on our next board meeting; to review the Grand Slam selection process, going forward,’ Hearn told the <a href="https://www.skysports.com/darts/news/31695/11864895/the-darts-show-with-gerwyn-price-barry-hearn">Darts Show.</a></p>
      <p>‘The problems that the BDO have got have been well-monitored, they are inevitably having a tough time but I think there is still a way forward for them but they have to alter their attitude and make it clear that they’re concentrating on amateur darts.</p>

      <p>‘If you’re going to try and compare like with like then they’re always going to come second best and that’s not going to do them any good with TV, sponsors, and players.</p>
      <p>‘If they say they are in charge of amateur darts, grass roots darts, on the way to a professional career then they might have a brand that they can market and sell.</p>
      <p>‘You can’t be stuck in yesterday because the world moves on.</p>
      <p>‘The PDC has gone from strength to strength, we’ve attracted the best players out there and it’s every darts player to stand up at Alexandra palace in December as champion, because they know they’ve changed their lives.’</p>
      <p>The BDO have been going through substantial changes under chairman Des Jacklin throughout 2019, many of which have caused problems.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/confusion-reigns-world-masters-fake-names-redraw-resignation-blight-bdos-oldest-major-10975363/">World Masters was something of a mess</a> while there is still a lot of confusion over the upcoming 2020 World Championship, with uncertainty over prize money and <a href="https://www.live-darts.com/category/bdo-darts-news/less-than-ten-percent-of-tickets-sold-for-bdo-world-championship-20191119/?fbclid=IwAR2zHyR5lnPpItgYPKsEvXuJPYhkxjCxyp3O5lzN1O4kGf45efqMCpOFbCc">reportedly very poor ticket sales</a> at the new venue, the O2 in London.</p>
      <p>Television deals and venues for tournaments have been put in place, but there remains concern over the financial viability of the organisation.</p>
      <p>Former BDO world champion Scott Mitchell posted a now-deleted tweet which warned there may be no BDO this time next year if the World Championship is not a success.</p>
