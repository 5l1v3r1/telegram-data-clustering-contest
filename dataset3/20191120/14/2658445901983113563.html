      <p>According to the Visionary/ Lead Worshiper of the event, Rev. Dr. Israel Kristilere, the event Is not a concert but a spiritual exercise which affords everyman no matter how good or bad.</p>
      <p>“I must state that this is not a concert and the goal is not to have a spectacular musical display in spite of the invitation of gifted and well known artistes,” said Rev Kristilere.</p>
      <p>“It is not a prayer assembly or religious convocation. It is a serious spiritual exercise which affords every man no matter how good or bad his voice is, equal opportunity to invade the heavens with worship and praises. We shall invoke Gos through worship. We shall activate his presence via pure worship.</p>
