      <h1>Sister Derby Replies Fan Who Asked Her Whether She Still Talks To Medikal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:27:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/ghbase2/" target="_blank">Ghbase New Writer</a></address>
      <p>Sister Derby has managed to keep her head up high since her relationship with rapper Medikal tumbled down with a loud bang somewhere last year.</p>
      <p>We know how it feels to be used and dumped by someone you truly love and want to share the rest of your life with.</p>
      <p>The singer and model, despite the heartache and humiliation in all this and watching another celebrity in the shape of Fella Makafui take over her position in Medikal’s heart, has still maintained some level of decorum in the way she deals with MDK.</p>
      <p>Even recently, she was seen jamming to Medikal’s song during the 2019 MTN 4Syte Music Video Awards held at the Kempinski Hotel in Accra last Saturday.</p>
      <p>To this end, an IG user sought to find out from the African Mermaid whether she still talks to Medikal.</p>
      <p>She calmly replied by saying she’s really cool with the reigning Vodafone Ghana Music Award Rapper of the Year winner.</p>
