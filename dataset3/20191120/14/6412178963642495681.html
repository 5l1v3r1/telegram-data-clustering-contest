        <b>Manchester United will be rivalled by Manchester City as they look to sign Leicester defender Caglar Soyuncu for £43m in January, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Turkish international has been one of the Foxes’ most impressive performers this season, with <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/leicester-city">Brendan Rodgers’ team</a></b> only conceding eight goals in 12 Premier League games so far.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/caglar-soyuncu"><b>Soyuncu</b></a>‘s rise comes after he was asked to step in in the absence of Harry Maguire, who left the King Power Stadium for Old Trafford in the summer and according to Turkish outlet <a href="https://www.fanatik.com.tr/milli-yildizlara-hucum-2102656"><b>Fanatik</b></a>, the Red Devils want history to repeat itself as they target a move for Soyuncu.</p>
      <p>The source says that United have been impressed by the centre-back so far this term and believe that £43m will be enough to prise him away from the East Midlands in January.</p>
      <p>However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are not alone in registering interest in Soyuncu, with the report adding that Manchester City are keen on the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>City’s defence has struggled this term with Fernandinho having to step in following Aymeric Laporte’s injury, which will rule him out until early next year.</p>
