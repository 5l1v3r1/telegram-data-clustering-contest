      <p>Members of the Karnataka Kshatriya Okkuta belonging to various sub-sects of the Kshatriya community launched a day-and-night dharna in Hubballi on Wednesday seeking political representation and fulfilment of various demands.</p>
      <p>The agitation was in continuation of the protest which was staged in Bengaluru to press for the community’s various demands. Members of the community began the dharna in front of the Mini Vidhana Soudha in the morning. They said that it would conclude on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Led by State president of the Karnataka Kshatriya Okkuta Uday Singh, Okkuta State Youth Wing president Krishna Dalabhanjan, vice-presidents Pandurang Pammar and Lakshman Gandgalekar and other office-bearers, including Narayan Vaidya, Keshav Yadav, Hanumantsa Niranjan, scores of members of the community, including women, took part in the day-and-night protest.</p>
      <p>The protestors alleged that their community was being used as a vote bank and successive governments had ignored their rightful demands in every sector. “Our services are being utilised in every work and our patience and patriotism are being misused,” they said.</p>
      <p>The office-bearers said that they were forced to take to the streets as their repeated pleas had not been considered by those in power.</p>
      <p>The protestors urged the BJP-led State government to immediately take steps to give the post of Deputy Chief Minister to a leader from the community and include at least four MLAs from the community in the Ministry.</p>
      <p>They also urged the government to set up the Karnataka Kshatriya Development Corporation, give adequate representation to leaders from the community in boards and corporations, install statues of Shivaji Maharaj and Nalvadi Krishnaraj Wadiyar on the premises of the Vidhana Soudha and include the community under 2A category of Backward Classes instead of 3B category.</p>
