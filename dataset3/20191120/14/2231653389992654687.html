      <h2>Google has updated the rich results testing tool to preview recipes on smart displays using Google Assistant.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:09:24+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://searchengineland.com/author/barry-schwartz" target="_blank">Barry Schwartz</a></address>
      <p>Google has updated the rich results testing tool to enable recipe publishers to preview how thei recipe results look on smart displays using Google Assistant.</p>
      <p><b>The announcement. </b>“If your recipe mark up is eligible for guidance with Google Assistant, you can now use the Rich Results Test to preview your results on Google Home and smart displays,” Google <a href="https://twitter.com/googlewmc/status/1196809923537047553">announced</a>.</p>
      <p><b>How it works. </b>Go to the <a href="https://search.google.com/test/rich-results">rich results testing tool</a>, plug in a URL that has recipe markup, then click on the “assistant” tab on the left side, and on the bottom, you can select “preview in Google Home Hub.”</p>
      <p><b>What the preview looks like. </b>Here is a screenshot of one example I tested:</p>

      <p><b>Why we care. </b>As more users go to their Google Assistant devices, including smart displays like the <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-home-hub-an-seo-perspective-307426">Google Home Hub</a>, it is important to understand how your recipe markup will translate into what searchers will see on these displays. This preview feature gives you just that so you can make adjustments in a more proactive manner to your rich results for recipes.</p>
