      <h1>Google Search Console adds Product results filters to performance report</h1>
      <h2>Google announced you can now drill deeper into how your product rich results are doing in search.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:24:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://searchengineland.com/author/barry-schwartz" target="_blank">Barry Schwartz</a></address>
      <p>Google <a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/11/products-rich-results-search-appearance.html">announced</a> it has added new filters to the performance report within Google Search Console to show you how well your product results are doing in search. Google now captures and displays click and impression data when rich results display based on your use of <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/product">product rich results markup</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The report. </b>Find this data under the Performance report by clicking on “search appearance” and then on “product results.” You’ll see clicks and impressions and can further segment by device, geography and queries.</p>
      <p><b>What it looks like. </b>Here is a screen shot of the report:</p>

      <p><b>What is a product rich result</b>? Below is a screenshot of what a product rich result looks like, but you can learn more about this in this <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/product">developer document</a>. Product rich results typically show product ratings, price, availability and some description information. Note that product rich results are not new, just the report in Search Console.</p>

      <p><b>Why we care. </b>The more data the better for SEOs and publishers, and this gives us more granular data on the impact of us adding product rich result markup to our pages. Google said this will show you how much traffic comes from experiences with rich data like price and availability and how does shopping traffic change over time, and the shopping search queries your website shows.</p>
