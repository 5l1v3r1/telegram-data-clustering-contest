      <p>This shocking video shows a six-year-old boy driving a sports car at breakneck speed while being egged on by a grown man in the passenger seat.</p>
      <p>He can barely sit down on the seat as he takes a 155mph Golf Type R, which can reach 60mph in under five seconds, for several laps of a seemingly abandoned road.</p>
      <p>At one point in the video the man tells the little boy to ‘show me what you got’ as he encourages him to drive faster through a narrow gate.</p>
      <p>As the little boy turns the car around, the man asks him for the camera: ‘How old are you?’</p>
      <p>And he replies: ‘Six.’</p>
      <p>The boy drives up and down the potholed road at least four times as they test the sports car’s ‘launch control’.</p>

      <p>He is constantly being egged on by the man in the passenger seat who acts as his irresponsible instructor.</p>
      <p>The man tells him: ‘Easy, whip her round, give it a little bit of power, go on, get up there.’</p>
      <p>The viral footage has emerged on an Instagram page set up to show the little boy’s driving exploits.</p>
      <p>Since the video was released, the page has posted a screengrab of a different video which claims to show the same child driving what appears to be a Land Rover when he was four-years-old.</p>
