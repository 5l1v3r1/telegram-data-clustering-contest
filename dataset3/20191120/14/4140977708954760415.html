                      <h3>What is the difference between head coach and manager?</h3>
                      <p>The answer can be found in Pochettino’s gripe with Club chairman Daniel Levy earlier in the summer. When questioned about the transfers, the Argentine replied:</p>

                          <p>
                            <i>“These types of things, what will happen, what will not happen, selling and buying of players, extending contracts, not extending contracts, I think it is not in my hands. It is in the club hands, and Daniel Levy. At the moment I am managing the team in the best way possible.</i>

                            <p>
                              <i>“Maybe the club need to change my title description, because my job now is to coach the team. It is not a question for me, it is a question for the club. Maybe the club are going to change my title description.     </i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Of course, I am the boss, deciding the strategy to play, training, mentality, philosophy in my area, but in another area, I think I am the coach.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>With Jose Mourinho being appointed the head coach, it is likely that this means while Mourinho can make his wishes known in terms of signings, outgoings and negotiations, the final say will remain in Daniel Levy’s hands. However, Mourinho is not the only with the title in the Premier League. London rivals, Arsenal and Chelsea have also appointed Unai Emery and Frank Lampard as head coaches of their respective sides.</p>
