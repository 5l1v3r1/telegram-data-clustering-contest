      <p>Natasha Oakley had her fans drooling on Wednesday with a sizzling new <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> upload that sent temperatures soaring.</p>
      <p>The snap was taken on Bondi Beach in the bikini queen’s native Australia, where she was captured sitting cross-legged in the sand. She looked absolutely stunning as she posed for the dimly-lit shot, which saw her, of course, wearing a sexy two-piece from her own Monday Swimwear line that did nothing but favors for her incredible curves.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old’s skimpy bikini boasted a bold leopard-print pattern – one of the season’s most popular trends that alone made it hard to ignore. It included an underwire-style top with a daringly low scoop neckline that displayed an ample amount of cleavage, making for a risque showing of skin that Natasha’s 2.1 million followers hardly seemed bothered by. Its thin straps were worn slunk down the babe’s shoulders in a sensual fashion, upping the ante of her look even more.</p>
      <p>The blond bombshell also wore a pair of matching bikini bottoms that showed just as much skin, if not more. The piece was of a dangerously high-cut style that left Natasha’s hips and toned thighs exposed in their entirety, allowing her to show off even more of her deep, all over tan. Meanwhile, its curved waistband sat high up on her hips, accentuating her trim waist and rock hard abs – though the area hardly needed any help earning recognition.</p>
      <p>Natasha kept her look simple and opted not to add any accessories, letting her flawless physique take center stage. She wore her platinum tresses down in beachy waves that were messily strewn around her face, with some cascading in front of her shoulders. She also donned a simple makeup look in the photo that included a pink lip, shimmering highlighter, and thick coat of mascara that made her striking features and natural beauty shine.</p>
