      <p>SARAJEVO, Bosnia — A Bosnian lawmaker has publicly shared shocking photos of children tied to beds and radiators in a public care home outside Sarajevo.</p>
      <p>Sabina Cudic of the opposition Nasa Stranka party presented the photos ahead of a session of the parliament of one of the country’s two semi-autonomous parts, the Bosniak-Croat Federation.</p>
      <p>Cudic said the photos were taken over the past year in the Pazaric care home for special needs children, and urged the parliament to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p>Her initiative was rejected by the majority of lawmakers, but the parliament tasked one of its working groups to investigate the allegations and submit a report within a week.</p>
      <p>Pazaric is already being investigated on suspicion of financial misconduct by the government-appointed management.</p>
