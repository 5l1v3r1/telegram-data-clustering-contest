      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Dane County Executive Joe Parisi has been walking the talk in his approach to mental health and substance abuse issues, increasing funding and access and building new partnerships to reach more residents in need of care. And he stepped it up again this week.</p>
      <p>Parisi, State Representative Shelia Stubbs, and representatives of area health care providers and advocates for people with mental illnesses are creating a new Dane County Universal Access Resource Center, a one-stop access point to care. It's a proactive effort to make it easier for folks to get care especially at times when they are least able to advocate for their health needs on their own. For the next year the county, SSM Health, UW Health, NAMI Dane County and others will be working to create a system that includes more effective and efficient care delivery as well as training for first responders. We appreciate the focus and the commitment.</p>
