        <i>Lizzo scores eight nominations with Eilish and Lil Nas X on seven, but British artists largely snubbed in major categories</i>
      </p>
      <p>The 17-year-old pop sensation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> has become the youngest artist to be nominated in all four of the most prestigious Grammy award categories: record, album and song of the year, and best new artist.</p>
      <p>Her gothic, innovative single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyDfgMOUjCI">Bad Guy</a>, which topped the US charts, is nominated in the song and record categories, while her similarly chart-topping album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/29/billie-eilish-when-we-all-fall-asleep-where-do-we-go-review">When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</a> is nominated for the album prize. She completed a sweep of the top categories with a best new artist nomination, and has six nominations in all. Her album engineers got a nod in the best engineered album category, including her brother and collaborator Finneas, who received three nominations.</p>
      <p>The most nominations were for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/20/lizzo-cuz-i-love-you-review">Lizzo</a>, who received eight, including in the top four categories. The powerhouse Minneapolis singer, known for her vociferous support of body positivity as well as her showboating flute solos, has been a slow-burn success, first releasing music in 2013 but scoring breakthrough hits this year with Juice, Tempo and US No 1 hit Truth Hurts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/29/lil-nas-xs-old-town-road-sets-new-record-for-most-weeks-at-no-1">Lil Nas X</a> received six nominations, including three in the top categories, predominantly for his song Old Town Road. It is indisputably one of the most successful songs of the year, breaking a US chart record with its 19 consecutive weeks at No 1 – Mariah Carey and Boyz II Men’s duet One Sweet Day had held the honour since 1996. All three of Eilish, Lizzo and Lil Nas X have never received a Grammy nomination before.</p>

      <p>R&amp;B singer HER scored five nominations, including record, album and song of the year, with Ariana Grande also earning five, including record and album of the year – her first appearances in the major categories. Wisconsin singer-songwriter Bon Iver was nominated four times, including record and album of the year, while Beyoncé – in a relatively minor year with no solo album release – still managed to secure four nominations, for her Lion King soundtrack work as well as her Coachella concert film Homecoming.</p>
      <p>While recent years have seen Grammy success for the likes of Ed Sheeran and Adele, British artists were mostly shut out of the top four categories. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/oct/10/lewis-capaldi-theyre-screaming-americas-sweetheart-at-me-its-wild">Lewis Capaldi</a> received a nomination for song of the year for his ballad Someone Like You, which has topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Bristol country-soul singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/21/yola-from-down-and-out-in-london-to-nashvilles-country-soul-star">Yola</a> was nominated for best new artist, and received three further nominations in American roots categories.</p>
      <p>Radiohead frontman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/thom-yorke">Thom Yorke</a> earned three nominations in specialist categories, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/chemical-brothers">Chemical Brothers</a> scoring three, and two for R&amp;B singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/09/ella-mai-i-dont-know-the-last-time-an-r-and-b-artist-was-recognised-at-the-brits">Ella Mai</a>. Other nominated Brits include the 1975, Bring Me the Horizon, James Blake and Elvis Costello. A surprise inclusion was Bones UK, a Camden rock band who, despite their low profile, secured a nomination for best rock performance with their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uGvX3q9zfY">Pretty Waste</a>.</p>
      <p>Lil Nas X also crops up in the rap categories, this time with his single Panini in the running for rap/sung performance. The genre’s biggest prize, best rap performance, features a posthumous nomination for Nipsey Hussle, the LA star who was shot dead in April.</p>
      <p>Snubs include Taylor Swift, who might have expected more than just one nomination in major categories – song of the year for Lover, the only song in the category to feature a single songwriter – and Ed Sheeran, whose collaborative album No 6 Collaborations Project only generated one nomination, for pop vocal album. Sam Smith received no nominations for his major US hit Dancing With a Stranger, nor did Halsey, whose single Without Me spent 29 weeks in the US Top 10 and went five times platinum.</p>
      <p>The total lack of nominations for Solange’s acclaimed album When I Get Home or Bruce Springsteen’s Western Stars is also surprising – the Guardian has asked their record labels if their albums were put forward for nomination.</p>
