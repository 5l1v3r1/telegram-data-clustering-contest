      <p>Veteran television actress, Rhoda Mtembe, popularly known as Mai Sorobhi in the yesteryear drama “Paraffin” is reported to be languishing in poverty as economic woes take their toll. The sad state of the once plump 76-year-old is in no way consistent with someone who once had a nation glued to the television screen.</p>
      <p>Having suffered a <a href="https://www.zbc.co.zw/mai-sorobhi-appeals-for-help-after-stroke/">stroke</a> early this year, Mtembe is now handicapped and can hardly walk. Soon after the stroke, Mtembe made an appeal to get physiotherapy assistance so that she could regain her movement abilities and maybe her dream to revive her acting career.</p>

      <p>Mai Sorobhi was wife to the late Phillip Mushangwe in the drama series, Paraffin, where Mushangwe played the role of Paraffin.</p>
      <p>Mtembe quit acting some years back citing that it did not pay well.</p>
      <p>In the years following independence, Zimbabwe’s film industry was thriving. Now, the recent economic crisis is taking a toll.</p>
