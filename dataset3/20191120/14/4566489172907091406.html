      <h1>BT threat as fall-out spreads over Andrew's Epstein links</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:10:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:10</time> by <a rel="author">Phil HAZLEWOOD with Andrew BEATTY in Sydney (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>British telecoms giant BT on Wednesday threatened to end its backing for an awards scheme unless Prince Andrew was dropped as patron, in the latest fall-out from the royal's interview about paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>BT has been working with Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award (iDEA) since its launch in 2017 to develop digital enterprise and employability skills.</p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth II's second son is patron but has come under increasing pressure since he defended his friendship with Epstein in a BBC television interview broadcast last weekend.</p>
      <p>Since the interview aired, the 59-year-old prince has been accused of lacking empathy for Epstein's victims, and there have also been questions about his lavish taxpayer-funded lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Some British media outlets have suggested that what is developing into the most high-profile royal scandal in years could even make it a second "Annus Horribilis" for the ageing monarch.</p>
      <p>The queen used the term in a 1992 speech to refer to a year in which her Windsor Castle residence caught fire, both Andrew and her eldest son and heir Charles separated from their respective wives, and her only daughter, Anne, got divorced.</p>
      <p>Last month, her grandson Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, announced plans to sue media outlets for alleged phone hacking and breach of privacy.</p>
      <p>A BT spokesman said it had only dealt with iDEA's executive directors rather than the prince, who has also been accused of using racist language in a separate incident.</p>
      <p>But he added: "In the light of recent developments we are reviewing our relationship with the organisation and hope that we might be able to work further with them, in the event of a change in their patronage."</p>
      <p>- Pitch@Palace ditched -</p>
      <p>The warning came after three Australian universities -- Bond, Murdoch and RMIT -- severed ties with Prince Andrew's Pitch@Palace charity to promote entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Murdoch said it had "advised Buckingham Palace it would not continue its participation", while Queensland's Bond said it had brought forward a review set for next year.</p>
      <p>"In light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement," a Bond University spokesperson told AFP.</p>

      <p>RMIT University said its "involvement with Pitch@Palace concluded in October 2019" and would not be renewed.</p>
      <p>"We remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring RMIT is a safe and inclusive place to work and study," the university said.</p>
      <p>Several UK-based businesses, including Standard Chartered and KPMG, have already announced they will not renew their support for the Pitch@Palace initiative.</p>
      <p>London Metropolitan University was among others to say it would review the position of Andrew as its patron at its board of governors meeting next week.</p>
      <p>Students at Huddersfield University in northern England also said they want the prince to step down as patron. The allegations made him "an utterly unsuitable representative", they said.</p>
      <p>- Palace tight-lipped -</p>
      <p>Epstein, 66, was found dead in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10 as he awaited trial on allegations that he trafficked girls as young as 14 for sex.</p>
      <p>In the television interview, Andrew denied having sex with a 17-year-old girl allegedly procured by the disgraced millionaire financier.</p>

      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both expressed sympathy for Epstein's victims during a televised general election debate on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Asked further if the monarchy was "fit for purpose", Johnson said only that it was "beyond reproach". Veteran socialist Corbyn said it "needs a bit of improvement".</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace has not commented directly on Andrew's interview.</p>
      <p>But a spokesman said the prince would be continuing his work supporting entrepreneurship, science, technology, young people and skills.</p>
      <p>On the racism claims, one of which was made by a former British interior minister Jacqui Smith, the spokesman said Andrew had worked in the Middle East for years and had many friends from the region.</p>
      <p>"He does not tolerate racism in any form," he added.</p>
