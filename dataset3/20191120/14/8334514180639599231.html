      <p>(Reuters) - Vouch Insurance, a platform offering business insurance for startups, said on Wednesday that it raised $45 million and would expand into California.</p>
      <p>Silicon Valley startups increasingly are offering services to other young companies, from human resources to start-up-focused credit cards.</p>
      <p>The San Fransisco-based company has raised $70 million to date. The company declined to disclose its valuation. Y Combinator Continuity, the venture arm of Silicon Valley incubator Y Combinator, led the latest round.</p>
      <p>The companyâ€™s co-founder and CEO, Sam Hodges, said that Vouch, which launched in Utah and Illinois in September, plans to offer coverage nationwide by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>The company said its policies are backed by Munich Re, a major reinsurance company.</p>
