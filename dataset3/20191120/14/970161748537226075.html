      <p>Donald Trump’s friend Gordon Sondland is set to turn on the president in an explosive statement planned for Wednesday’s impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>US Ambassador to the EU Sondland will say there was a ‘quid pro pro,’ which corroborates the key accusation of abuse of office leveled at the president. He is also set to present previously unseen communications with top White House officials.</p>
      <p>An advance copy of Sondland’s statement obtained by NBC News says the White House explicitly offered Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky a coveted invite to Washington DC.</p>
      <p>Sondland is set to claim that the invite was offered on the understanding that Ukraine began probing top Trump rival Joe Biden and Biden’s son Hunter’s links to a Ukrainian natural gas firm.</p>
      <p>Trump faces impeachment hearings, which could cost him his presidency, over claims he abused his office to for personal political gain.</p>

      <p>He is also accused of withholding $400million in military aid from Ukraine until the probe into the Bidens was opened.</p>
      <p>Sondland is set to face questions over his credibility after making dramatic changes to his statement, having previously claimed there was no basis for the claims against Trump.</p>
      <p>He claims his memory has been jogged by listening to other witnesses, and has also implicated Secretary of State Mike Pompeo – one of Trump’s closest ally in the White House.</p>
      <p>Sondland reportedly plans to say: ‘They knew what we were doing and why.’</p>
      <p>‘Everyone was in the loop. It was no secret.’</p>
      <p>Trump denies any wrongdoing, and has branded the hearing against him a ‘witch hunt.’</p>
      <p>Hotelier Sondland, who donated to Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, is considered to be the most crucial witness at the ongoing impeachment hearings, which are set to wrap-up this week.</p>
      <p>He faced scrutiny over a recently-revealed phone conversation with the president. It was made the day after Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in which Trump mentioned the Bidens. Sondland is also set to be grilled over a September 1 phone call with a top Zelensky aide.</p>
      <p>In the early stages of the impeachment inquiry, Sondland’s text messages to the top US diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, emerged. In those texts, Sondland told Taylor there was ‘no quid pro quo’  after speaking to Trump about his phone call with Zelensky.</p>

      <p>Democrats are accusing Trump of withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as leverage to get Zelenksy to investigate Trump’s political rival and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, regarding his son Hunter’s connection with Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma. Trump and his defenders say there is no proof of this trade-off.</p>

      <p>Sondland said Trump told him directly that ‘there was no quid pro quo’ and claimed he did not know why almost $400 million US military aid to Ukraine was withheld. ‘Quid pro quo’ is a Latin phrase that essentially means ‘a favor for a favor.’</p>
      <p>He later contradicted his testimony, adding a three-page revision that said he recalled telling a top Zelensky aide that the security aide was linked to the investigation into the Bidens and the 2020 election in a September 1 phone call.</p>
      <p>Sondland had limited work in government before Trump tapped him to be ambassador to the EU in July 2018. He has stated that he has specific interest in Ukraine and told Ukrainian media outlets in July that Trump gave him ‘special assignments, including Ukraine.’</p>
      <p>His much-anticipated testimony was centered around his role in Trump’s Ukrainian policy after former White House national security aide testified that Sondland told her he was in charge of Ukraine policy because Trump said so.</p>
      <p>When asked about the conversation during a deposition, Sondland said: ‘I don’t recall. I may have’ I hay not have. Again, I don’t recall.’</p>
