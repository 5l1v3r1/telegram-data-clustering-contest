      <p>Microsoft Outlook is one of the most popular email services on the internet. You can access it on the web as well as on Android, iOS and Windows devices. If you’re using Microsoft Outlook app, you’ll be able to add email accounts from different service providers t00. The feature is now available on the Outlook web.</p>
      <p>On Outlook.com, you’ll now be able to add your Gmail accounts much like you can do with the Outlook app on Android, iOS, and Windows. However, this is currently limited to Gmail, meaning that you won’t be able to add any other email service other than Gmail to Outlook.com. That said, Microsoft could lift the limit in the coming days.</p>

      <p>One important thing to note here is that the feature seems to be rolling out in a phased manner. It means not everyone will get the feature today.</p>
      <p>I haven’t received the feature yet, but if you’re one of those lucky users who received the update, you can sound off in the comments section below.</p>
