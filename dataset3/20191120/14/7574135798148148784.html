      <p>Last year, <b>Taking Back Sunday</b> <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/taking-back-sunday-part-ways-with-guitarist-eddie-reyes/">parted ways</a> with <b>Eddie Reyes</b>, who founded the band in 1999 (and was in Mind Over Matter, The Movielife, and other Long Island bands before that), and then Eddie started the new band <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/whats-going-on-friday-156/"><b>Fates Got A Driver</b></a>. Earlier this year, <i>Where You Want To Be/Louder Now</i>-era guitarist/secondary vocalist (and former Breaking Pangaea frontman) <b>Fred Mascherino</b> re-activated his project <b>The Color Fred</b> with their <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/15-new-songs-out-today-8/">first new song in a decade</a> and some shows. Now, The Color Fred and Fates Got A Driver are set to play some shows together, and Fred and Eddie will be doing their own version of ‘Emo Night’ with DJ sets and karaoke at the shows.</p>
      <p>“The Color Fred played an Emo Night that our friend Jon runs in Pennsylvania and we had a blast,” Fred says. “He was spinning all of the bands that Eddie and I use to play with, so we thought it would be fun to do it in other places and have Eddie’s band help make it even more fun.’</p>
      <p>The shows happen at Easton, PA’s <b>One Center Square on January 23</b>, Asbury Park, NJ’s <b>Wonder Bar on January 24</b>, and Amityville, NY’s <b>Amityville Music Hall on January 25</b>.</p>
      <p>Listen to the new Color Fred single, a single off Fates Got A Driver’s debut EP, and a video of Fred-era Taking Back Sunday, below.</p>
