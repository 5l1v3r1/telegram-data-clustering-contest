      <p>Pati Patni aur Woh is a remake of the 1978 comedy of the same name. Starring Kartik Aaryan, Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday, the film is set to release on December 6. After the release of its first song Dheeme Dheeme, another groovy number just hit the internet and we’re sure it’s going to be on several playlists right away.</p>

      <p>A reprise of the 2002 chartbuster Akhiyon Se Goli Mare from Dulhe Raja, this new song is yet another dance number that shows the lead actresses going at a tug of war for Kartik. Sung by Mika Singh, the song has all the masala, from colourful sets to blingy costumes and of course, a cool hook step. While the original song by Sonu Nigam, starring Govinda and Raveena still has our hearts, this new rendition to the song is going to make you tap your feet with the lead actors. </p>
