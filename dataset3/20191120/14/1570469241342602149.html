      <p>Three Australian universities severed ties with a charity founded by <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/uks-prince-andrew-denies-having-sex-with-epstein-accuser-262718">Prince Andrew </a>Wednesday after the British royal refused to recant his friendship with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Bond University, Murdoch University and RMIT University in Melbourne said they would no longer work with "Pitch@Palace" -- a charity founded by the Duke of York to promote entrepreneurship.</p>
      <p>Murdoch said it had "advised Buckingham Palace it would not continue its participation" in the Pitch@Palace project, while Queensland's Bond University said it had brought forward review set for next year.</p>
      <p>"In light of recent events, the university does not intend to seek any further involvement," a Bond University spokesperson told AFP.</p>
      <p>RMIT University said its "involvement with Pitch@Palace concluded in October 2019" and would not be renewed.Â </p>
      <p>"We remain steadfast in our commitment to ensuring RMIT is a safe and inclusive place to work and study," the university said.</p>
      <p>The announcements follow several UK-based businesses -- including Standard Chartered and KPMG -- and some universities already announcing they will no longer associate themselves with the Prince or his charities.</p>
      <p>This came after he denied having sex with a 17-year-old girl during a lengthy and much-condemned BBC interview in which he also described Epstein's behaviour as "unbecoming".</p>
      <p>Epstein was found dead in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center on August 10 as he awaited trial on allegations that he trafficked girls as young as 14 for sex.</p>
