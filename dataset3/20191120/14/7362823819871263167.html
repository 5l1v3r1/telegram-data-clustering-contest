      <p>The Twitter user, who identified himself as Paz, also claimed that passengers were not immediately allowed off the plane once the smoke was detected, and that he had “not stopped coughing” as of posting the tweet on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A representative for Delta was not immediately available to verify whether the cause of the smoke had been identified.</p>
