      <h1>World Cup dream fades away as Indonesian soccer team loses again</h1>

      <p>Indonesia missed another chance to make it to the 2022 FIFA World Cup after suffering a fifth consecutive defeat in the Asia Zone Group G qualifiers against Malaysia on Tuesday evening.<br/><br/>Indonesia’s national soccer team has three more qualifiers scheduled for next year – against Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam – but with no points collected so far, the troubled team is unlikely to ever reach the 2022 Cup.<br/><br/>Cheered on by the home crowd at Bukit Jalil Stadium in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia defeated Indonesia 2-0, all courtesy of winger Muhammad Safawi.<br/><br/>Safawi produced a stunning free-kick in the 30th minute after he was fouled close to the box by Indonesia’s Yanto Basna. Later, he scored the second goal in the 73rd, making the most of a blunder by Indonesian captain Yanto. Safawi had chances to make it a hat trick, which were denied by the post and the guests’ goalkeeper.<br/><br/>Indonesia was led by interim coach Yeyen Tumena after head coach Simon McMenemy was sacked due to the team’s poor performance throughout the qualifiers.<br/><br/>Yeyen admitted that his squad’s flaws had contributed to Malaysia’s victory.<br/><br/>“We lost the chance to make a goal, [and they took] advantage of our blunders to score.<br/><br/>“Malaysia’s two goals were like our gift for them,” Yeyen told the press after the match as quoted by news agency Antara.<br/><br/>Indonesia had two chances for a goal in the first half, but Febri Haryadi and Greg Nwokolo failed to make it happen.<br/><br/>In the second half, Indonesia’s Osas Saha was awarded a penalty in the 83rd, offering a chance to at least close the goal gap, but his easy-to-read shot frustrated fans at home.<br/><br/>Despite the wasted penalty kick, Yeyen refused to look down on his players. However, he said he would take the failure as a turning point for the Indonesian team to rise up.<br/><br/>“I’ll say the [missed] penalty was our turning point. Regardless, the 90-minute match has ended and we cannot change the result,” he added.<br/><br/>Febri, who immediately congratulated the opposing team after the final whistle, apologized to the home fans for his team’s disappointing performance.<br/><br/>“We are aware that the end result was not as expected and that it was a disappointment, but we, the players, have done our best. We worked really hard on the pitch, but we failed to make use of the opportunities,” he added.</p>
