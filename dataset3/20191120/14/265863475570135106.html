      <p>Reginae Carter shared a message on her social media account that has fans saying that she is hinting at YFN Lucci. Check out the post below.</p>
      <p>â€˜&amp; if you leave, youâ€™re leaving the best so you would have to settle for less ðŸ’‹ @fashionnova AD,â€™ Nae captioned her photo.</p>
      <p>Someone said: â€˜Tell Wayne shout me, am definitely his biggest fan in Nigeria lol @colormenae @liltunechi @youngmoney.â€™</p>

      <p>A follower said: â€˜You got that body right huh you werenâ€™t playing good shit.ðŸ™Œ,â€™ and another fan also gushed over Nae: â€˜Awww baby you are so sexy n fine I love everything about you sexy.â€™</p>
      <p>Someone asked Nae: â€˜Are you talking about Lucci, yes?â€™ and people continued to make all kinds of assumptions after this.</p>
      <p>A fan had an idea for Nae: â€˜You should start your own handbag collection you wear them so well!!â€™</p>
      <p>Reginae and YFN Lucci have reportedly broken up a while ago, and since then, people were terrified that Nae would eventually go back to him once again, like she used to do.</p>
      <p>But it seems that Toya Wrightâ€™s daughter did not go back so far, and fans could not be prouder of her.</p>
      <p>Nae was recently in the spotlight when itâ€™s been revealed that Tiny Harris and Toya Wright took their daughters on vacay in Mexico.</p>
      <p>Reginae <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/zonnique-pullins-and-reginae-carter-dance-in-front-of-the-camera-in-mexico-but-deyjah-harris-is-not-here-for-this-339214/">shared footage</a> in which fans can see her and Zonnique Pullins dancing in front of the camera, but Deyjah Harris, Tinyâ€™s other daughter, wanted no part in this.</p>
