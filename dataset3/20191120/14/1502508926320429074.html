      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/institutional-investors">Institutional investors </a>have invested $1 billion in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/stressed-assets">stressed assets </a>in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/real-estate">real estate </a>during the current year and more such transactions are expected with 87 companies in the sector facing liquidation, a property consultant said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The residential segment with stalled projects worth $66 billion provides opportunities to these investors, JLL India CEO and country head Ramesh Nair said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/institutional-investors">Institutional investors </a>have made a solid start by investing $1 billion in stressed <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/real-estate">real estate </a>opportunities (in 2019)," he said.</p>
      <p>In the current scenario, it is the housing segment that presents "the maximum amount of stressed assets", Nair said.</p>
      <p>Moreover, corporate, saddled with huge debt, have been scouting for liquidating <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/real-estate">real estate </a>assets, he said.</p>
      <p>A stressed asset deal has been the sale of an IT park in Bengaluru by Caf Coffee Day Enterprise Ltd for $359 million, the consulting firm said. JLL also listed deals like acquisition of the 90-acre, IT-focused Global Village Tech Park and Hotel Leela Venture's key properties in Delhi, Bangalore, Udaipur and Chennai for $564 million.</p>
      <p>Early this month, the Centre approved a Rs 25,000- crore fund to help complete over 1,500 stalled housing projects, including ones that have been declared NPAs or admitted for insolvency proceedings.</p>
