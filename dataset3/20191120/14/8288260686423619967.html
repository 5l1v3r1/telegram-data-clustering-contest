      <p>Today, Warren said: "When you've had something like that and it's taken away from you, and you're not earning a living out of it anymore, and all people want to know is daft stuff.</p>
      <p>"Well it seemed daft because now I wasn't earning any money. I came crashing down into the real world. I could earn £2,000 an hour, now I'm lucky if I could get £20 an hour.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"And then people are coming over like, 'What's Ulrika like? What's Wolf like?' and in the end I'm like, 'I'm not actually public property any more, I'm just trying to make a living so I don't really want to talk about it anymore.'</p>
      <p>"I know that sounds conceited, but I felt like I was living in the past."</p>
