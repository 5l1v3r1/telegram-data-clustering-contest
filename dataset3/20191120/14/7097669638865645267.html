      <h1>This New JetBlue Security Question Is Proving Almost Impossible to Answer. Or Is It?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:03:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.time.com/" target="_blank">Mahita Gajanan</a></address>
      <p>A security question from JetBlue is asking parents to do something they’d likely never do in public, or even on the semi-privacy of their browsing session: share the name of their favorite child.</p>
      <p>In a screenshot posted on Twitter Sunday, a user shared part of the account sign-up process on JetBlue’s website — specifically, the security questions page. And one question in particular, which point blank asks, “what is the name of your favorite child?”</p>
      <p>“JetBlue savage for this,” the user wrote. (The question is technically “optional,” per the screenshot, but still.)</p>

      <p>The airline took the matter in stride, and retweeted the screenshot on Tuesday, adding: “Say it. You know you have one.”</p>

      <p>Naturally, the first response was a GIF of <a href="https://time.com/5731562/baby-yoda-memes-explained/">“baby Yoda”</a> from the Disney+ <i>Star Wars</i> series T<i>he Mandalorian</i>, a character that has recently become the internet’s favorite child. Another user suggested listing the name of her rescue dog instead of her childrens’.</p>

      <p>While most parents would likely claim they love all their children equally, at least <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/parents-do-have-a-favorite-child_n_56fece43e4b0daf53aefb181">one study</a> has shown that parents favor, or at least show preferential treatment toward one child. But naming a ‘favorite’ child could help parents in terms of security — a hacker trying to get into your account is unlikely to be clued into unspoken family dynamics. According to <a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/security-question-and-answer-tips/#gref">Infosec Institute</a>, which provides training to IT and security professionals, choosing to answer less obvious security questions makes for a stronger account.</p>
      <p>On the flipside, if your Internet presence makes it clear you only have two or three children, it’s a not-too-difficult guessing game to play out. And — in perhaps a worst-case scenario — it could also lead to some very awkward questions on a family vacation if you’re only offered an upgrade for you and the child in question.</p>
