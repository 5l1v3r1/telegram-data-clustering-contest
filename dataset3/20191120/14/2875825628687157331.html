      <h1>Strictly's Tess Daly eats her own split ends, hates germs and doesn't work under real name</h1>
      <h2>Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly, who is married to Vernon Kay, has a pretty eccentric outlook on life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:56:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:56</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tess Daly may come across as a glittering, cool-as-a-cucumber host on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> , but she's secretly got a whole range of eccentric dislikes.</p>
      <p>The 50-year-old TV presenter, who co-hosts the hit BBC show alongside Claudia Winkleman, rarely gives interviews, but has admitted in the past that Tess isn't her real name.</p>
      <p>The blonde bombshell was actually born Helen Elizabeth Daly, but goes by a diminutive of her middle name for work.</p>
      <p>She's never explained why her stage name is different from her real one, but started out her modelling career as a 17-year-old as 'Tess'.</p>

      <p>Tess is married to Vernon Kay and has two daughters - Phoebe Elizabeth and Amber Isabella - with him.</p>
      <p>The pair went through a rocky patch in 2010 when Vernon was caught sexting glamour model Rhian Sugden and exchanging inappropriate messages with her behind Tess's back.</p>
      <p>He was forced to issue a grovelling apology live on Radio 1, telling listeners that he'd made "some stupid decisions".</p>
      <p>"I have disappointed and I have let down a lot of people. I am very sorry," he said.</p>
      <p>"Tess is extremely upset. Hopefully I can clear the slate and start again."</p>

      <p>While Tess has never explicitly spoken about the time her marriage nearly imploded, she did hint in December 2018 that it was their two daughters who kept them going.</p>
      <p>"There are so many highs with children to celebrate. It’s the good times that keep you together," she told the Daily Star.</p>
      <p>The couple married in 2003 and celebrated their 16th wedding anniversary earlier this year.</p>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/tess-daly-vernon-kays-beautiful-18993083">live with their children in a plush Buckinghamshire mansion</a> - but Tess retains a fear of germs that regularly disrupts daily life.</p>

      <p>"I have an extreme germ phobia," she told the Guardian in 2016.</p>
      <p>"Toilet door handles, the ice-cream seller holding your cone with his bare hands, touching raw meat or chicken," she told the Guardian.</p>
      <p>Tess opened up about her most unappealing habit, admitting she can't stop eating her own hair.</p>
      <p>"I bite off my split ends. There’s probably a fur ball in my stomach," she confessed.</p>

      <p>Tess also explained why she no longer drives black car, out of a mix of superstition and practicality.</p>
      <p>"[The closest I've come to death was] on a motorway three years ago," she revealed.</p>
      <p>"An HGV hadn't seen me and pulled out. My father-in-law's a truck driver and he said black cars are not very visible. I don't drive them any more."</p>
