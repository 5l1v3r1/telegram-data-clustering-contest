      <h1>Mario Kart Tour winter event reveals its Holiday gifts</h1>
      <h2>Gifts you have to grind for, that is</h2>

      <p>Nintendo has released a new trailer showcasing the festive fun headed to mobile racing title <i>Mario Kart Tour.</i> The Winter Tour got underway yesterday, bringing new content and offering up holiday-themed rewards.<br/><br/>Snowy new course DK Pass has been added to the track circulation, while several other courses will be decorated in various festive items such as Christmas trees and lights. As I predicted, (because there was no way it wasn't happening), a "Santa Mario" racer variant has been made available to win from the maligned pipe system. <br/><br/>Mario will be joined by two more new racers in the future - "Pink Gold Peach" on December 4 and "Black Shy Guy" on December 18. For those of you who are more about slick vehicles, a new selection of karts and gliders will also be made available. Finally, from a technical standpoint, the <i>Mario Kart Tour</i> controls have been tweaked slightly, making adjustments to steering and drifting dynamics.</p>
