      <p>Enhancement Prisms are one of the new types of upgrade currency introduced to Destiny 2 with Shadowkeep. Getting your hands on more Enhancement Prisms is going to be a bit tricky, time-consuming, or cost quite a lot of resources. However, if you want to start increasing the Energy rating of your armor, you’ll need a good supply.</p>

      <h3>How to get Enhancement Prisms</h3>
      <p>There are three ways to get Enhancement Prisms in Destiny 2: purchase them, unlock them, and receive them as a reward. Unfortunately, these items are almost as rare as their new sister consumable, the Ascendant Shard.</p>
      <p>But to expand on how to get them further, the three sources are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Purchased from the Gunsmith</li>
        <li>Unlocked by leveling up the Season Pass</li>
        <li>Rewarded upon completing Nightfall: The Ordeal</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Purchase from the Gunsmith</h4>

        <figcaption>Buying an Enhancement Prism will set you back quite a few resources.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The first method of acquiring Enhancement Prisms is to buy them from Banshee-44 in the Tower. You will need a lot of planetary resources, as well as Enhancement Cores and Glimmer. The cost of a single prism is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>10 Enhancement Cores</li>
        <li>25 Planetary materials</li>
        <li>10,000 Glimmer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can only hold a maximum of 10 Enhancement Prisms at a time, which is convenient as that’s exactly how many it will cost you to buy an Ascendant Shard from the Gunsmith. Buying these prisms from Banshee-44 will likely be an early-game option when you’re increasing your Power to do Nightfalls, and then a late-game option when you’re trying to bridge a gap.</p>
      <h4>Ranking up the Season Pass</h4>

        <figcaption>The Season Pass offers Enhancement Prism rewards at set ranks.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Another method, which only applies to those who purchased it, is to get Enhancement Prisms from the Season Pass. You will be rewarded with a couple of prisms in the later levels of the Season Pass, so leveling up quickly is going to be important.</p>
      <h4>Nightfall: The Ordeal</h4>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Enhancement Prism are an uncommon or common drop from Nightfall: The Ordeal, depending on what difficulty you select.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The last way to get Enhancement Prisms is to complete Nightfall: The Ordeal on Legend or Master difficulty. These two are 950 and 980 Power respectively. Unfortunately, the prism is not a guaranteed reward, in fact, it’s classified as an uncommon and common reward, again, respectively.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Getting Enhancement Prisms in Destiny 2 is tough, but not as tough as Ascendant Shards. The economy of increasing your armor’s energy definitely favors stockpiling Enhancement Cores, so make sure you’re keeping a healthy supply of those.
