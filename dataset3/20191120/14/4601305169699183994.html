      <p>Bakersfield, California. That's where you'll find the last Woolworth's Luncheonette in America — and it's still serving food!</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://la.eater.com/2018/4/11/17225594/woolworth-bakersfield-luncheonette-history-antique-mall-open">Eater Los Angeles</a></i>:</p>
      <blockquote>Step into the Five &amp; Dime Antique Mall in Bakersfield, California, and that rarity becomes reality. There, in the back corner at the ground-floor level of the four-story building, is a fully functioning former Woolworth luncheonette counter, complete with 22 counter seats, Formica tables ringing the room, and an open kitchen for griddling burgers and making milkshakes. But this well-protected bit of ephemera isn’t cordoned off with Do Not Touch signs — it’s still a real, thriving luncheonette counter called the Woolworth Diner, serving police officers, antiquers, and locals daily.</blockquote>
