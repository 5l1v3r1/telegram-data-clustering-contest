      <p>KUCHING, Nov 20 — The state government has allocated RM30 million through the Sarawak Foundation to help National Higher Education Fund Corporation (PTPTN) borrowers in the state to repay their loans.</p>
      <p>Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Abang Johari Openg said those who had been assisted would have to pay back to the Sarawak Foundation based on a mechanism that would be determined later.</p>
