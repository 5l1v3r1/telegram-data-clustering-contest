      <p>The former Manchester United coach <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/breaking-tottenham-hotspur-appoint-jose-mourinho/667797">replaced Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham Hotspur</a> following the dismissal of the Argentine on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is facing the task of leading last year’s UEFA Champions League finalists back up the table after Spurs dropped to 14th place on the Premier League log.</p>
      <p>He is well-known for spending big money and might be keen to convince chariman Daniel Levy to splash some cash in January already.</p>

      <p>According to the <i>Mirror</i>, Mourinho could attempt to revive Spurs’ interest in Juventus forward Paulo Dybala as well as Sporting midfielder Bruno Fernandes.</p>
      <p>Both were previously linked with the Premier League side during the recent window but Mourinho might be able to convince Levy to invest further into the squad.</p>
      <p>AFC Bournemouth defender Nathan Ake might be another player Mourinho could look at. Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are both out of contract after the season and Ake’s January arrival could ensure that the club will not get under pressure in case both defenders would leave.</p>
      <p>Upfront, Spurs are still lacking a back-up for striker Harry Kane, with the void potentially being filled by Zlatan Ibrahimovic. The Swede is a known admirer of Mourinho and previously worked with him at Manchester United and Inter Milan. However, it remains to be seen whether he would be prepared to play second fiddle.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Finally, Nemanja Matic could be the one player Mourinho might look to get from his previous club. The midfielder already followed him from Chelsea to United and has fallen down the pecking order under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>United, meanwhile, might be keen to sell him before his contract expires at the end of the season, while Mourinho could look at him to bring more experience into their fairly young squad.</p>
