      <p>Since its release in October, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/3/20893138/joker-review-joaquin-phoenix-robert-de-niro-todd-phillips"><i>Joker</i></a> has proven itself a box office juggernaut, becoming the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/26/20933907/joker-box-office-records-r-rated-movies-deadpool-ryan-reynolds">highest-grossing R-rated movie</a> of all time. Though the critical response was divisive, Todd Phillips’ reimagining of the infamous Batman villain’s origins won the top prize at this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/7/20854584/joker-movie-joaquin-phoenix-awards-oscars-release-date">Berlinale</a>, as well as generating serious awards chatter for next year’s Oscars.</p>
      <p>It should come as no surprise, then, that a sequel is in the works. The Hollywood Reporter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">reports</a> that <i>Joker</i> director Todd Phillips (who had originally proposed doing an entire series of DC character origin stories) is currently in talks to go a second round with Arthur Fleck, with writer Scott Silver also set to return.</p>
      <p>As for <i>Joker</i>’s star, Warner Bros. has sequel options in place for Joaquin Phoenix, which means that, if all goes well, the whole team will be back to (presumably) break Fleck out of Arkham and cause a little more chaos on the streets of Gotham. And, who knows, we may even see more of the young Batman.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> A follow-up report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a> refutes The Hollywood Reporter’s story, saying, “at this point there are no deals for a [<i>Joker</i>] sequel, nor even any negotiations with director Todd Phillips or his co-writer Scott Silver to craft one.” Deadline also says that reports that Phillips pitched other DC origin stories are “flat false.”</p>
      <p>When reached for comment, sources at Warner Bros. said to refer to Deadline’s report. This story has been updated with a new headline.</p>
      <p>In other words, it sounds like there’s been no movement on a <i>Joker</i> sequel yet, though the film’s financial success makes it likely.</p>
