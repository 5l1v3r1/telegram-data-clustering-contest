      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:04:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/robert-hynes/" target="_blank">Robert Hynes</a></address>
      <p>A lucky Co Galway punter is over €6,000 richer today after seeing all four of his selections win on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The anonymous punter placed the €0.25 each-way Lucky 15 bet in a <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/boylesports">BoyleSports</a> shop selecting three horses at Kempton and one at Fairyhouse, investing a total stake of €7.50.</p>
      <p>The first winner came at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fairyhouse">Fairyhouse</a> with The Chapel Field winning the 3.05 race at a handsome price of 10/1 to get the wager off to a flying start.</p>
      <p>The customer then secured a fantastic treble across the pond at Kempton with All Yours (8/1), Pianissimo (20/1) and Ginger Fox (8/1) all obliging at healthy odds meaning the Galway punter could start celebrating.</p>
      <p>When all the results where known, the client exchanged their €7.50 bet slip for the tasty amount of €6,677.26, a windfall that took just over an hour to win.</p>
      <p>Sarah Kinsella, spokesperson for BoyleSports said: “Well done to our customer in Galway whose ambitious thinking with some big priced winners paid off in style and enabled them to walk away with €6,677.26 from a €7.50 stake.</p>
      <p>"We wish them happy spending and hope they enjoy the festive season with their winnings.”</p>
