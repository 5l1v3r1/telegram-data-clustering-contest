      <p>A cabin crew member has been accused of being nearly seven times the alcohol limit while working at Heathrow Airport.</p>
      <p>Lemara Thompson, 27, allegedly had 135mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in her body while on duty for US-based Delta Airlines on June 16 this year.</p>
      <p>She faces one charge of performing an aviation function with a blood alcohol level over the prescribed limit.</p>
      <p>The limit is currently 20mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood, according to Civil Aviation Authority rules and the Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003.</p>
