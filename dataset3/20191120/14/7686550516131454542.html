      <p>Police are appealing for witnesses after two people were seen running from a large fire which totally destroyed a three-storey property in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/carmarthenshire">Carmarthenshire</a> .</p>
      <p>The blaze broke out in the early hours of Tuesday morning at an empty house in the Graig area of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/burry-port">Burry Port</a> .</p>
      <p>Fire crews from Llanelli, Kidwelly and Tumble tackled the blaze and confirmed that the house - consisting of two floors and a basement - was in an abandoned state.</p>
      <p>The fire was so serious investigators were unable to enter the detached house at all on Tuesday due to the temperature inside making conditions unsafe.</p>
      <p>Police, who were at the scene on Wednesday, are not treating the incident as arson, but are asking for anyone who saw “people acting suspiciously” to come forward.</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for Dyfed-Powys Police said: “We are investigating a fire at an abandoned property in Burry Port.</p>
      <p>“A call was made at around 1.20am today (Tuesday, November 19) reporting that a detached house in Graig was well alight.</p>
      <p>“The house is not lived in, and has sustained substantial fire damage.</p>
      <p>“There were no witnesses to indicate who has started the fire, but two people were seen running away from the scene.”</p>
      <p>The fire is being investigated by both the police and the fire service.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact Dyfed-Powys Police by calling 101, or by reporting it <a href="http://bit.ly/dppReportOnline">online</a> .</p>
