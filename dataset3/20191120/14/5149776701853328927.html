      <h1>Community sentence for BMW driver who killed a cyclist riding home from a dominoes match</h1>
      <h2>James Ellison was speeding and hit cyclist Gary Dowell</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:33:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:33</time> by <a rel="author">Rod Malcolm</a></address>
      <p>A BMW driver has been ordered to do 100 hours community work after he sped home in his new car and killed a cyclist.</p>
      <p>James Ellison was at least 13mph over the limit as he approached a green light at a junction, Nottingham Crown Court heard.</p>
      <p>Antiques dealer Gary Dowell, 52, had no lights on his mountain bike and was wearing dark clothing in the 50mph limit area as he rode home from a pub dominoes match in the village of Upton.</p>
      <p>Reflective strips on his top were on the side facing away from the approaching car.</p>
      <p>Jon Fountain, prosecuting, told the court: "A collision with Mr Dowell was unavoidable."</p>
      <p>But he added: "Had he not been speeding, the collision may have been entirely avoided. His speed on impact would have been reduced to 9mph."</p>
      <p>A four-month prison term, suspended for a year, was imposed on Ellison, 28, of John Gould Avenue, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/newark">Newark</a>.</p>
      <p>He admitted causing death by careless driving and was banned from the roads for a year.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Ellison had just bought the BMW, and was driving along the A617 just before <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/cyclist-52-dies-after-collision-1573871">10pm on May 15 last year</a>.</p>
      <p>He had overtaken two vehicles as he came up to a junction.</p>
      <p>Mr Fountain said that the cyclist "crossed the defendant's path."</p>
      <p>Simon Eckersley, mitigating, said that Ellison had the "green light in his favour", but admitted that he had been speeding.</p>
      <p>"It is an incident where criminal culpability is accepted, but where it can still be described as a tragic accident," he told the court.</p>
      <p>Ellison was remorseful and that was felt by his family, the court heard. It ended his hopes of joining the Royal Marines.</p>
      <p>Mr Eckersley added: "This is not a man who has simply ignored this and moved on with his life. It has had a profound effect on his mental health."</p>
      <p>Judge Sally Hancox said the case underlined the importance of speed limits.</p>
      <p>"They are there for good reasons," she said. "Some may think they are an annoyance, some may think there is a clear road, good conditions and the opportunity for a little more progress.</p>
      <p>"They are there to protect not only the driver but to protect other motorists, even those on other forms of transport, people on bicycles or those who choose to be pedestrians.</p>
      <p>"It is to make sure they are safe and secure. That is why a speed limit is there."</p>
      <p>Outside court, Mr Dowell's father Gordon said the father-of-two was badly missed by his family and friends.</p>
      <p>Mr Dowell, 81, said: "Gary was gregarious and very well liked. He had a large collection of friends, many of them also antiques dealers.</p>
      <p>"He was a very respectful and responsible person but he was nonchalant. Gary was Gary."</p>
      <p>His son specialised in antiques and collectibles linked to motoring. These included items like old oil cans and adverts for cars.</p>
      <p>He lived in a farm near Kelham. It took four days to auction his hoard of memorabilia, with the proceeds being held in trust for his children, who are nine and 12.</p>
