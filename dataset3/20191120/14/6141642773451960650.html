      <p>Gareth Bale has risked the wrath of Real Madrid by celebrating Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification success with a Welsh flag poking fun at his Spanish club.</p>
      <p>Bale – who has played four times for Wales since his last appearance for Real on October 5 – has been criticised in Spain in recent months for putting country before club.</p>
      <p>Former Real striker Predrag Mijatovic spoke out against keen golfer Bale in a newspaper article, saying: “The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid.”</p>

      <p>Wales fans have turned the mantra ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid’ into a chant, with Bale himself admitting he found the song amusing.</p>
      <p>And Bale provided his critics with more ammunition after Wales’ 2-0 home victory over Hungary on Tuesday secured their place at Euro 2020 next summer.</p>
      <p>As Bale celebrated qualification with team-mates, he was directly behind a Welsh flag which said ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In That Order’.</p>
      <p>The Spanish media reacted angrily on Wednesday to the pictures of Bale posing with the flag.</p>

      <p>Sports daily AS’ headline read “Bale is ‘mocking’ Madrid with the ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid’ flag”, while Sport.es queried whether Bale should be punished by his club.</p>
      <p>“Bale had no qualms about being in the centre of the image, practically carrying the flag where you could read this message that clearly implies a contempt against the Madrid club,” Sport.es said.</p>
      <p>“Now we need to know if Real Madrid will take any action against its player, considering it as a clear contempt and attack on the club’s image.”</p>
      <p>But the influential Madrid daily sport newspaper Marca said Real would not punish Bale, because the relationship between the player and manager Zinedine Zidane is “broken for good”.</p>
      <blockquote>Bale is 'mocking' Madrid with the 'Wales. Golf. Madrid' flag<cite>The headline in the Spanish sports daily As</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Bale has not played for Real since picking up a calf injury on international duty for Wales in October.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old, however, linked up for Wales’ Euro 2020 qualifiers with Azerbaijan and Hungary, playing an hour in Baku last weekend and 88 minutes in Cardiff on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Bale prompted an angry response from Real fans before the Azerbaijan  game last week by saying he enjoyed playing more for his country than his club.</p>
      <p>“I definitely have more excitement playing for Wales,” Bale said.</p>

      <p>“With Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable.</p>
      <p>“But it doesn’t change what I do on the pitch. I always give 100 per cent on the pitch wherever I am, that’s what I always strive to do.”</p>
      <p>Bale’s future in Spain has been under constant scrutiny since Zidane returned as Real manager in March.</p>

      <p>Bale’s proposed move to Chinese club Jiangsu Suning, where he was reportedly to be paid £1million a week over three years, collapsed at the 11th hour.</p>
      <p>The Welshman, who joined Real from Tottenham in 2013 for a then world-record fee of £85.3million, returned to the first-team fold and scored twice in six league games.</p>
      <p>But Bale, who is contracted at Real until June 2022, could move on in January with China and the United States possible destinations.</p>
