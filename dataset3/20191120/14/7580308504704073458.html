      <h1>Social Media Bill passes second reading at Senate</h1>

      <p>Nigeria’s Senate on Wednesday read, for the second time, the bill seeking to regulate the use of Social Media as well as curb fake news on the internet.</p>
      <p>The bill, ‘Protection from Internet Falsehood and Manipulations Bill, 2019,’ sponsored by Mohammed Musa was introduced two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The passage of the bill for the second time comes despite many controversies around the bill. Critics say the bill seeks to fight freedom of speech in the country.</p>
      <p>However, Musa said the bill does not intend to gag the media but to check the spread of false information on the internet.</p>
      <p>Musa proposed N300,000 fine for an individual if found guilty; and up to N10 million for corporate organisations.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chimaroke Nnamani (Enugu East) opposed the passage of the bill, stating that the bill was completely unnecessary given the provisions of the Cyber Crimes Act.</p>
      <p>The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, referred the bill to the Senate Committee on Judiciary. The committee was asked to report back after four weeks.</p>
      <p>As part of its work, the committee is expected to conduct a public hearing on the bill.</p>
