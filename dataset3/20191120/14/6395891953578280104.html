      <p><b>MEXICO CITYÂ (AP)</b> - Armed thieves tried to abduct an entire convoy of fuel tanker trucks in northern Mexico, but security forces fought off the gang in a shootout.</p>
      <p>Mexico began moving fuel in tanker trucks this year to combat thefts from government pipelines. But now thieves appear to be attacking even fuel convoys.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors in the northern border state of Sonora said Tuesday that two police officers noticed several fuel tanker trucks pulled over on the side of a highway. The trucks were carrying fuel to nearby mines.</p>
      <p>Two gunmen who had apparently hijacked the convoy opened fire on police, wounding one of them.</p>
      <p>An army squad later moved in to help pursue the gunmen, who fled, leaving behind an assault rifle, a pickup and fuel containers.</p>
