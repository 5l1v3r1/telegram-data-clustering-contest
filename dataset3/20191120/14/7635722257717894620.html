        <b>Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster says he'll be staying with the Hoops for the rest of the season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Reports had suggested that Southampton were considering using a recall clause in his loan deal in January.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy here and glad to be back here playing. I just want to do as well as I can so I think I'll be here for the season.</p>
      <p>"It's brilliant. When I had the opportunity to come back up I was glad that it was going to be for the season. I wanted to be back here and I wanted to be playing.</p>
      <p>"I had a very hard 18 months before going back up where I wasn't playing for Southampton when I'd been so used to playing. I think I played pretty much every game before then apart from when I was out injured.</p>
      <p>"I've had a good start to the season so I'm absolutely buzzing to be up here and making the most of it."</p>
      <p>The England international says he'd like to move to the Scottish champions on a permanent transfer but admits the decision is out of his hands.</p>
      <p>"I'm only focusing on the short term really. So much of what will happen will be out of my hands. I'm just concentrating week by week, enjoying it while I can. The rest will take care of itself."</p>
