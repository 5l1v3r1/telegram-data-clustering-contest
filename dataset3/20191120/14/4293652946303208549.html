      <p>Rimouski Océanic forward and top NHL draft prospect Alexis Lafrenière <a href="https://lhjmq.qc.ca/suspensions-et-amendes-2019-20/">has been fined</a> $1,000 for his actions during a brawl in Sunday’s game against the Shawinigan Cataractes.</p>
      <p>The melee occurred late in the second period of a 6-4 Océanic win. In the aftermath, Lafrenière was given a game misconduct for abuse of an official and a two-minute penalty for cross-checking.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the QMJHL announced Lafrenière was fined for abuse of an official and inappropriate language to an opponent, with each infraction costing $500.</p>
      <p>The Océanic will pay the fines on Lafrenière’s behalf.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old had two goals and an assist in Sunday’s game before his misconduct. He now has a league-leading 51 points in 23 games.</p>
      <p>Lafrenière wasn’t the only player to receive supplemental discipline after the game. His teammate, Frédéryck Janvier, as well as the Cataractes’ Mikael Robidoux and Leon Denny, were all suspended.</p>
