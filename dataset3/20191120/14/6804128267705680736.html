      <h1>Breaking: Jose Mourinho's Tottenham backroom staff confirmed</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese has added two names to his backroom team at Tottenham Hotspur</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T14:24:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has arrived at Tottenham to replace Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>But one of the next questions has been who will join him and make up his backroom staff at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>And that has been confirmed, or at least two members have, by French club Lille.</p>
      <p>Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos, both members of Lille's technical staff, have joined Mourinho in N17 following talks between the two clubs.</p>
      <p>Sacramento will become Mourinho's assistant head coach.</p>
      <p>Sacramento is a Portuguese coach who has been assistant manager to Lille boss Christophe Galtier for almost three years. In his previous role, he served as a technical assistant to Leonardo Jardim and Claudio Ranieri at Monaco, where he became the manager of opposition analysis for the first team.</p>
      <p>Before those two jobs in professional first team football, Sacramento spent time in Wales.</p>
      <p>He worked in the scouting department and as an Under-15s assistant coach for Cardiff City, as well as an assistant coach at the University of Glamorgan and as a performance analyst for the Football Association of Wales, working under Gary Speed and Chris Coleman.</p>
      <p>The other new recruits at Spurs will be fitness trainer Carlos Lalin, Giovanni Cerra who will join the analysis team and scout Ricardo Formoshino.</p>
