      <p>Edwin Roderick went on to try to threaten colleague Emily Durrant not to pursue a complaint against him.</p>
      <p>He admitted breaching the council's code of conduct at an Adjudication Panel for Wales hearing on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mr Roderick has since offered his sincere "heartfelt apologies" and said "nothing like it will happen again".</p>
      <p>The panel heard he was "panicking" when he approached Melanie Doel, who chairs Brecon Beacons National Park Authority, asking her to arrange a meeting with the complainant because he had information about her.</p>
      <p>In his summing up, the chair of the panel, John Livesey, said the victim had felt degraded and humiliated.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Roderick behaved in a way that had "long been deemed unacceptable in public life".</p>
      <p>Mr Livesey said the "threats, some would say, were akin to blackmail" adding that he was "naive to think no action would be taken" because the conduct was serious.</p>
      <h3>Further training</h3>
      <p>Mr Roderick has been suspended as a councillor, including from his role on the board of the national park authority.</p>
      <p>He has also been asked to undertake further training in relation to his breach of the code of conduct.</p>
      <p>David Daycock, representing Edwin Roderick, said he was a "rough hewn farmer who was not used to the heightened formality and niceties of committee meetings".</p>
      <p>And character witness Councillor Timothy Van-Rees said any breach of the code of conduct was "completely out of character", but it "must be said that Councillor Roderick is not a sophisticate".</p>
      <p>Speaking after the hearing Mr Roderick said: "I fully respect the decision of the tribunal and felt I had a fair hearing.</p>
      <p>"I apologise yet again to all affected by the case, particularly the complainant.</p>
      <p>"I deeply regret the incident and will ensure nothing like it will happen again."</p>
      <p>Ms Durrant said she was glad the process had ended and accepted Mr Roderick's apology.</p>
