      <p>Accusing the CPI(M) of having double standard on Islamic extremism, BJP State general secretary K. Surendran has said the party adopted such a posture when its members were booked under UAPA cases.</p>
      <p>The CPI(M) took such a tactical stance only to tide over the wrath of the people, Mr. Surendran told a news conference here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He also likened the functioning of Islamic extremism and CPI(M) to that of twins. Now the party was just hoodwinking the people when it had always been lending a helping hand to Muslim fundamentalist outfits, he alleged.</p>
      <p>Citing several incidents, Mr. Surendran charged the CPI(M)-led governments with sabotaging terror-linked cases in the State. These included the e-mail hacking case at the Kerala Police headquarters, violence during the Kerala High Court march, WhatsApp hartal and the murder of SFI leader Abhimanyu at Maharajaâ€™s College, he said.</p>
      <p>He also accused the CPI(M) of having an alliance with the SDPI for holding on to power at Azhiyur grama panchayat in Kozhikode district. During the recent Assembly bypoll in the State, the CPI(M) also had a tacit understanding with the SDPI in Konni and Vattiyoorkkavu segments.</p>
      <p>Mr. Surendran said that the largest number of recruits to the Islamic State from India were from Kerala. And most of them were from the party villages in Kannur district, he said.</p>
