      <p>We already knew a new Saints Row is coming, but now we know when it will be discussed.</p>
      <p>Next year, we will hear all about the next entry in the <b>Saints Row</b> series.</p>
      <p>That’s according to Koch Media CEO Klemens Kundratitz, who told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-14-how-koch-media-is-ensuring-classic-brand-comebacks-are-worth-the-wait">GI.biz</a> Koch and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2018/02/14/saints-row-dead-island-metro-publisher-koch-media-acquired-thq-nordic/">its parent company THQ Nordic</a> will discuss the game next year.</p>
      <p>“Saints Row is very close to our hearts, and we’ll talk about it next year,” said Kundratitz. “For the time being, we just wanted to get the word out that it’s coming and it’s going to be great.”</p>
      <p>He also stated that Volition would not be distracted by “anything else,” like spin-off games such as Agents of Mayhem, when it comes to creating the next title in “this important franchise.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/08/14/thq-saints-row-dead-island/">THQ Nordic announced in August</a> a new SR game was in the works. The last numbered entry in the series, Saints Row 4, was released six years ago.</p>
