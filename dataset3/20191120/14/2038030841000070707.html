      <p>Cape Town - Halle Berry’s most recent on-screen project has been paused after the star suffered injuries.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7700651/Halle-Berry-suffers-injury-fight-scene-set-MMA-thriller-Bruised.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a>, the award-winning actress got hurt during one of her fighting scenes for her new mixed martial arts (MMA) movie, Bruised.</p>
      <p>Brian Pitt, executive producer for the upcoming film, described the injuries sustained by the 53-year-old as "nothing serious", despite her recovery having delayed production,<a href="https://people.com/movies/halle-berry-was-slightly-injured-on-set-of-upcoming-mma-film-says-producer-nothing-serious/"> <b>People</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>"Halle got slightly injured in the fight," he added. He went on to say: "She’s tired. She needed a break."</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time the star has got hurt while on set.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year she revealed she <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Movies/News/halle-berry-broke-three-ribs-rehearsing-for-john-wick-3-20190430"><b>broke three ribs</b></a> while rehearsing for her role on John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum.</p>
      <p>But, despite that, Halle pushed herself and regarded her injuries as her “badges of honour”.</p>
