      <p>Nice little Ed Sheeran isn't jizzing his money away on Teslas and jetpacks and whatnot, and is instead building a lovely little non-denominational church-type thing on the grounds of his home in Suffolk, for all his global friends of various religions to come and have a rest in, and thank their favourite god for making them mates with Ed and bestowing upon them his profitable guest vocalist appearances.</p>
      <p>East Suffolk Council has been <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/06/newts-delay-construction-of-church-of-sheeran/">ruminating on the plan</a> for ages, but has now granted permission regardless of the state of the local newts, letting Ed build his own private house of gods for use in "...key life and family milestones, family and social gatherings, marriages, christenings and so forth." [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-50480634">BBC</a>]</p>
