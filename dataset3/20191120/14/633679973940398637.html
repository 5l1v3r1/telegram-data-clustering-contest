      <p>A 20-year-old gang member was sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Regional Court to 19 years imprisonment of which he will effectively serve 12 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Police said that Elvis Cedras was sentenced on Wednesday for a shooting incident in March in Kleinskool.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson, Colonel Priscilla Naidu, said he was arrested by members of the Provincial Organised Crime Investigation Unit shortly after he and another man fired shots at a house.</p>
      <p>She said Unit members who were in the vicinity responded immediately upon hearing the gunfire and chased after the suspects, who had earlier walked past their stationary vehicle.</p>
      <p>“One suspect fired at police but the members managed to apprehend the suspect and a stolen 9mm pistol and ammunition was seized. No one was injured,” said Naidu.</p>
      <p>She said Cedras was sentenced on two counts of attempted murder and the illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.</p>
