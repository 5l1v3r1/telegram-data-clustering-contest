      <blockquote>“Broadridge’s SaaS technology powers more than 550 hedge funds, traditional asset managers and fund administrators with a complete front-to-back, multi-asset class solution that simplifies and improves firm trading and operations. As private markets continue to grow and present opportunities for asset managers to find alpha and differentiate themselves, the addition of ClearStructure’s private debt capabilities will create a differentiated solution in the market and enable Broadridge to serve new clients.”</blockquote>
      <p>While sharing more details about the acquisition, Eric Bernstein, Broadridge’s Head of Asset Management Solutions, stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“ClearStructure’s component services enhance our existing multi-asset class, front-to-back office solution, providing our clients with a unique capability to access the public and private markets. This acquisition aligns to Broadridge’s strategy of providing a true cross-asset platform to enable asset management clients to have a single view into their entire book of business.”</blockquote>
      <p>ClearStructure CEO, Scott Turley, went on to add:</p>
      <blockquote>“We’re delighted to join Broadridge and to offer expanded portfolio management technology to create optimum investment workflow efficiency for portfolio managers, investment analysts, risk professionals, and operations teams.”</blockquote>
