      <p>Janet Street-Porter was reunited with her former I'm A Celebrity campmate Paul Burrell on Loose Women on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Things appeared a little frosty between them at the start of the interview, but it was all in good humour.</p>
      <p>Janet claimed Paul was "vile" to her on the show, with Paul confessing it was down to the fact she refused to let him cook for the camp.</p>
      <p>The former royal butler and Janet took part back in the ITV jungle series in 2004, both providing some of the most entertaining scenes ever on the show hosted by Ant and Dec.</p>

      <p>During the series, Paul opened up on royal secrets about the Queen, while also opening up on his friendship with the late Princess Diana.</p>
      <p>But something he might not have known is that those conversations were orchestrated by show bosses, according to Janet.</p>
      <p>The journalist admitted to Paul on Wednesday that she was asked to push Paul on topics regarding the royal family.</p>

      <p>Wanting "the dirt" on the Queen and the other royals, producers apparently told Janet in secret to get Paul to spill the beans.</p>
      <p>She explained that her luxury item was a diary, and that every day she was given 15 minutes to write in it.</p>
      <p>After taking it back from her, they'd encourage her to speak with Paul.</p>

      <p>She told him on air: "When I was in there, every day I was getting instructions from producers and they were saying, 'You’ve got to get Paul to talk about the Queen.</p>
      <p>"'We don’t wanna hear about his mash potato, we wanna know the dirt on Diana'."</p>
      <p>Janet added: "You came up with the most fantastic stuff about the royal corgis weeing."</p>
      <p>He denied this was a secret before appearing to move the conversation on.</p>
