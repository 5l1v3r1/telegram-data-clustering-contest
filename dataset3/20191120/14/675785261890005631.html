      <h2>Dad 'KH' from Ohio, was shocked to find multiple signs calling for his son Randy James 'to die' in line with Darwinism, which relies on theory of natural selection</h2>

      <p>A dad who put up posters to raise cash for his son has been trolled by a heartless stranger calling for the baby to die.</p>
      <p>Parents Angela and KH Ahlers are fundraising for baby Randy James 'RJ' who was born with two rare conditions, mosaic trisomy 9 and genesis.</p>
      <p>The conditions can cause holes in his heart, kidneys and brain, resulting in a low life expectancy of aged two.</p>
      <p>When KH placed six large signs around a shopping complex in Toledo, Ohio, detailing their son's health battle, he was horrified to find spray painted signs placed next to his, that read: ‘Let the baby die. It’s called Darwinism. Happy Holidays.’</p>
      <p>KH, said: “It shocked me. It really shocked me that someone would have that kind of cruelty.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But despite the upsetting response, the dad-of-one refuses to retaliate to the messages and has binned them instead.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/19/us/baby-rare-disorders-hateful-sign-trnd/index.html">CNN</a> : “We want to raise our son to not reciprocate hatred with hatred. We want to battle hatred with love. So we obviously know that someone who did this isn’t well - and we hope they get help.”</p>
      <p>Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, also called Darwinism, states that all species of organisms arise and develop through the natural selection of small, inherited variations that increase the individual’s ability to compete, survive and reproduce.</p>
      <p>In other words, the sign was suggesting that since the child’s genetics wouldn't enable him to survive without life support, at present, then the continuum of the child’s life is ‘unnatural’.</p>

      <p>However, thankfully, the disturbing signs have in fact helped the couple’s appeal, by making their story global.</p>
      <p>Mrs Ahlers told CNN the couple had received an outpouring of support from people as far away as Australia, Canada and Argentina.</p>
      <p>So far the couple have raised more than $56,000 (£43,000) from just 1,300 generous donors.</p>
      <p>The family are relying on donations as many of the tests needed are not considered 'medically necessary', and so the parents are unable to seek financial support from government or local assistance programs.</p>
      <p>Though they have health insurance, the bills are adding up. One test ordered by a geneticist cost $10,000 (£7,700).</p>

      <p>The GoFundMe page for 'RJ', who was born on July 9 this year, explains that the centre of the tot’s brain is under developed due to Genesis of the Corpus Callosum.</p>
      <p>The second condition 'RJ' was born with is Trisomy 9 Mosaic Syndrome, a rare genetic chromosome disease, that only impacts 1,2000 people in the world as most die either before birth or before they are two years old, according to the GoFundMe page.</p>
      <p>'RJ' has battled against the odds.</p>
      <p>In four months he's had 15 specialist appointments, seeing a Cardiologist, an Orthopaedic Specialist, a Neurologist, a Urologist, an Ophthalmologist, and a Geneticist, his parents write.</p>
      <p>On 15 December, the family is planning a fundraiser after a superhero themed event in October raised $4,000 (£3,100).</p>
