        <b>It’s been an incredibly tough year for Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) in Hollyoaks, what with her losing her beloved twins, all the while dealing with unwanted advances from rapist Laurie Shelby (Kyle Pryor) — not to mention keeping Maxine Kinsella’s (Nikki Sanderson) secret which almost resulted in the breakdown of her and Brody Hudson’s (Adam Woodward) relationship — but could she be in more danger from Stuart Sumner’s (Chris Simmons) son, Sid (Billy Price) in the coming episodes?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sid’s had a rough couple of weeks, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/hollyoaks-spoilers-billy-price-promises-journey-for-sid-sumner-after-he-kills-dad-stuart-in-far-right-climax-11162990/">after being instrumental in his dad’s demise</a>, it’s no surprise that he’s finding things a bit difficult. In the coming episodes, the young lad turns up at school, and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/hollyoaks-spoilers-romance-revealed-for-juliet-quinn-and-sid-sumner-as-they-go-on-a-date-11068567/">informs Juliet</a> (Niamh Blackshaw) about the fact that he’s been sleeping rough.</p>
      <p>Juliet empathises with Sid — and refuses to judge him on the action of his parents — and thus she decides to tell Sienna about the young man’s living arrangements.</p>

      <p>After Juliet’s revelation, Sienna takes it upon herself to meet with Stuart’s wife Alice in regards to Sid’s predicament, but Alice isn’t convinced she’s strong enough to be a parent to Sid — that is, until Sienna manages to talk her round.</p>

      <p>However, there could be trouble ahead, as both Brody and Liberty (Jessamy Stoddart) make a rather unsettling discovery about Sid — at exactly the same time that Sienna returns to her flat with Alice in tow.</p>
      <p>What exactly is that Brody and Liberty have discovered?</p>
      <p>What’s more, is Sienna — and her family — in danger as a result?</p>
