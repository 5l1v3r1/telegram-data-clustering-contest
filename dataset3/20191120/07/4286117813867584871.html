      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss farmers' issues in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Home Minister Amit Shah also joined the meeting.</p>
      <p>However, Amit Shah left the meeting after a few minutes.</p>
      <p>The meeting of the two leaders comes two days after PM Modi praised the Sharad Pawar-led party during his speech in Rajya Sabha on Monday.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion of 250th Session of the Upper House, Modi said other parties, including the BJP, should learn from the NCP and Biju Janata Dal of Naveen Patnaik how to adhere to parliamentary norms.</p>
      <p>The praise for the Pawar-led party comes at a time when the NCP and Congress are trying to keep the BJP away from power in Maharashtra, where the President's rule was imposed on November 12.</p>
      <p>The BJP and the Shiv Sena fought the Assembly elections for the 288 member House, and they bagged 105 and 56 seats, respectively. However, the alliance came undone after Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray demanded rotational chief ministerial post -- a request denied by the BJP.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Congress and the NCP won 44 and 54 seats, respectively in the state.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena leaders are scheduled to meet Pawar later in the day.</p>
