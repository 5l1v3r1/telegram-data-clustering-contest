      <blockquote>Blender’s Video Sequencer has proven to be a very valuable tool to produce CG animation for us.<br/>With some python scripting we’ve extended it to be in the core of our pipeline at CrossRiver Production, an on-growing french animation studio. I found that it could be interesting to share some ideas on how we use blender on a daily basis, and maybe inspire people with similar needs.<br/><br/>All that said, this isn’t a one fit for all solution, we developed all these tools for small/medium sized teams and projects, and generally we trade speed and simplicity over fine grained control. But still it’s designed be adaptable to different projects needs.<br/><br/>We don’t plan to release or sell these tools, as it would mean sharing the whole pipeline that is a bit broader than what you see in the video. But feel free to ask questions and I’ll do my best to answer them and share the details on how it works.<br/><br/>Finally , I’d like to thanks especially Cédric Hansen that provided many core concepts and contribute a lot to the code. And also Jérôme Nougarolis, CEO of CrossRiver, that give us financial support to push these tools forward.<br/><br/><a href="https://blenderartists.org/t/a-vse-based-pipeline-for-animated-tv-series/1191738">I've open a similar Blender Artists thread</a>.</blockquote>
