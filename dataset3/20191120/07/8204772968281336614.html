      <p>Twitter said on Wednesday that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party misled the public by changing the name of one of its Twitter accounts to make it look like a fact checking service during a televised election debate.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account, followed by nearly 76,000 users, changed its name to “factcheckUK” from its usual “CCHQPress” and switched its avatar to a white tick against a purple background.</p>
      <p>It made the change while <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Johnson">Johnson</a> was debating opposition leader <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jeremy+Corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Labour">Labour</a> Party leader, on live television. The rebranded account tweeted graphics supporting statements from Johnson as “True” and criticised others from Corbyn.</p>
      <p>“Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election,” a Twitter spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>“We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action.”</p>

      <p>Full Fact, a genuine fact-checking charity, also criticised the Conservative tactic.</p>
      <p>“It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their Twitter account factcheckUK during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service,” it said.</p>
      <p>Labour said it was a “scam” that showed the Conservatives could not be trusted in government.</p>
      <p>Conservative Party Chairman <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=James+Cleverly">James Cleverly</a> defended the move. “We made it absolutely clear it is a Conservative Party website ... checking the claims” of Corbyn, he said.</p>
      <p>The account description during the debate was “Fact Checking Labour from CCHQ”. After the debate finished the account reverted to its regular Conservative party branding.</p>
      <p>Prior to the controversy, Twitter had pledged to make it easier to report misleading information about the voting process in Britain’s December 12th election.</p>
      <p>Twitter said last month it would stop all political advertising, making the British election one of the first major tests for the new policy.</p>
