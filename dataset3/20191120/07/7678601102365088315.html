      <h1>Satpol PP officers questioned for withdrawing up to US$2M at ATM while balances were unchanged</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:21:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:21</time> by <a rel="author">Vela Andapita</a></address>
      <p>Twelve Jakarta Public Order Agency (Satpol PP) officers have been accused of stealing up to Rp 32 billion (US$2.27 million) from city-owned Bank DKI after they kept withdrawing cash while noticing that their account balances remained unchanged after carrying out transactions for over three months.</p>
      <p>West Jakarta Satpol PP head Tamo Sijabat confirmed an officer under the unit, identified as M, had admitted wrongdoing and had been summoned by the Jakarta Police for questioning.</p>
      <p>Aside from M, the 12 officers implicated in the case include those who worked in the South Jakarta and East Jakarta units, the agency confirmed.</p>
      <p>Prior to being summoned by the police, the agency had also opened its own investigation into the case by questioning the alleged perpetrators, Jakarta Satpol PP Agency head Arifin said.</p>
      <p>He said the officers confirmed that they had withdrawn money from ATM Bersama linked to Bank DKI.</p>
      <p>"Based on the information that I received from them, they withdrew money from the ATM but later realized that the balance in their accounts remained unchanged. So they [withdrew] again,” he said as quoted by <i>kompas.com.</i></p>
      <p>"It’s possible that they were just confused, so that’s why they continued [to withdraw money] over and over again," he added. </p>
      <p>The officers reportedly kept withdrawing cash between May and August this year until the bank noticed irregular activity that caused losses of about Rp 32 billion, <i>tempo.co </i>reported.</p>
      <p>He, however, refuted allegations that the officers had committed money laundering or corruption.</p>
      <p>Arifin instead questioned Bank DKI's security system, which allowed such incidents to happen, and why the bank had only reported the irregularities months after the activity took place.</p>
      <p>"Why is [Bank DKI] making a fuss now? Also, I question their security system. [The officers] received their salaries through Bank DKI, so they withdrew cash but their balances remained unchanged," he said. </p>
      <p>Arifin, however, asserted that he was ready to terminate the 12 officers should they be proven guilty of criminal activity.</p>
      <p>Some of the officers had been made non-active as of Monday while the police carried out their investigation.</p>
      <p>“Some of the officers have been summoned and said they were willing to return the money to Bank DKI,” he said.</p>
      <p>Separately, Bank DKI corporate secretary Herry Djufraini said in a statement that the case did not pertain to theft and had not affected other accounts.  </p>
      <p>He also said bank services remained normal and that there were no issues with the bank’s security system.  </p>
      <p>"When the case emerged, we immediately coordinated with the police," he said. </p>
