      <p>Mohammad Shami, Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma have been instrumental in India’s emphatic wins in Tests matches at home over the last one month.</p>
      <p>Not only are they among the world’s best fast-bowlers in the last three years, they have helped clinch a perfect win record so far for India in Tests at home in 2019.</p>
      <p><b>Creme de la creme</b><br/>Between January 2017 and November 2019, most Indian pacers featured among the world’s elite. Only South African pacers had a better record.</p>

        <b>Spin wins, but...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Between 1933 and 2019 Indian quicks in Test matches at home have dismissed at least half of the opposition's batting line-up only on seven occasions, with the bulk of the wickets being picked by spinners.</p>
      <p>But so far this year, Indian bowlers have picked-up 77 wickets at home with 40 of them being bagged by pacers.</p>

      <p><b>Decisive contributors</b><br/>In the eight years when pacers picked at least 50% of the wickets, India has a perfect win record in only 2019 so far. In 1980, 1981 and 2006 India managed to win a third of its matches.</p>
