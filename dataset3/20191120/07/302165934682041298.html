      <p>TEHRAN, Nov 20 — Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the enemy had been “repelled” in the country where dozens are thought to have died in violent protests sparked by a petrol price hike.</p>
      <p>Demonstrations broke out in the sanctions-hit Islamic republic on Friday after it was announced the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200 per cent.</p>
      <p>“We have pushed back the enemy in the military arena. We have pushed back the enemy in the political war,” Khamenei said in a speech aired on state television late yesterday.</p>
      <p>“We have repelled the enemy in the arena of security warfare... in recent days,” he said, adding that the unrest had not been the result of a popular movement.</p>
      <p>“The recent actions were security issues, not from the people,” he said. “We have repelled the enemy.”</p>
      <p>State television, which rarely shows any signs of dissent in Iran, has aired footage of masked young men appearing to clash with security forces.</p>
      <p>The United Nations called for restraint on Tuesday and voiced alarm at reports dozens may have been killed in the violence.</p>
      <p>London-based rights group Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed across Iran since security forces were ordered to “crush” the protests.</p>
      <p>Iran's economy has been battered since May last year when the United States unilaterally withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed crippling sanctions. — AFP</p>
