      <p>Bundles of cash keep being found in a small village - leaving police utterly baffled.</p>
      <p>Cops have been left scratching their heads over the mystery bundles of cash, which have been discovered a dozen times.</p>
      <p>Police officers in the  County Durham  village of Blackhall Colliery still don't know where they are coming from.</p>
      <p>The bundles are almost always made up of £20 notes totalling £2,000 and are left in plain sight.</p>
      <p>The latest discovery was made on Monday (November 18).</p>
      <p>Officers are asking the public for any information they have on the origins of the cash bundles, which have been found four times this year so far.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Detective Constable John Forster, of Peterlee CID, said: “These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in.</p>
      <p>“This is the fourth bundle handed in this year.</p>
      <p>“This could be the work of a Good Samaritan but we would like to thank the residents who have shown incredible community spirit by handing the money in.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances remain a mystery so we would welcome any information that will help us get to the bottom of these random incidents."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He also said the money goes back to the person that found it if nobody claims it within a certain period of time.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is asked to call Durham Police on 101 and ask to speak to DC Forster.</p>
