      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:21:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/ap/" target="_blank">AP</a></address>
      <p>Philippe Coutinho scored one goal and helped set up another as Brazil beat South Korea 3-0 in a friendly Tuesday to give the five-time world champion its first win in six games.</p>
      <p>Four days after losing 1-0 to rival Argentina in Riyadh, Coutinho started the move that gave Brazil the lead in the ninth minute at the Mohamed Bin Zayed Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Bayern Munich midfielder found Renan Lodi, whose cross was headed home by Lucas Paqueta for his second international goal.</p>
      <p>Coutinho then curled home a free kick before the break to double Brazil’s lead.</p>

      <p>Even without the injured Neymar, Brazil continued to create chances and Danilo added the third goal on the hour mark by drilling a shot past Jo Hyun-woo.</p>
      <p>Tottenham forward Son Heung-min was South Korea’s most dangerous player but was unable to find a way past Alisson Becker in the Brazil goal.</p>
      <p>“The margin shouldn’t have been this large,“ South Korea’s Portuguese coach Paulo Bento said. “We missed chances to cut the deficit and ended up without a goal but I think we did a good job offensively.“</p>
      <p>Earlier, Venezuela won 4-1 against Japan in Osaka.</p>
      <p>A first-half hat trick from Salomon Rondon helped give Japan its biggest loss since 2017.</p>
