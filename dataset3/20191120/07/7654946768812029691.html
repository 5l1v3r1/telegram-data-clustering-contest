      <p>An alleged Neo-Nazi leader who directed accomplices to vandalize synagogues in the Midwest from his New Jersey home served as a volunteer firefighter at his local firehouse, a report said.</p>
      <p>Richard Tobin, 18, served for less than a year as a volunteer firefighter in the town of Brooklawn in South Jersey, <a href="https://www.nj.com/news/2019/11/suspect-who-allegedly-wanted-to-attack-african-americans-with-machete-at-mall-is-18-year-old-firefighter.html">NJ.com reported</a>, citing fire chief John McKinney.</p>
      <p>Tobin started in the department in Camden County through a program that introduces Boy Scouts to potential careers in firefighting, according to the report.</p>
      <p>He was arrested last week in connection to the vandalism of two synagogues in Michigan and Wisconsin.</p>
      <p>Authorities believe Tobin was directing the “Great Lakes Cell” of the white supremacist group “The Base” from his New Jersey home, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/why-arrest-of-richard-tobin-is-bad-news-for-neo-nazi-group-the-base">the Daily Beast reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“If there’s a window that wants to be broken, don’t be shy,” Tobin allegedly told the Neo-Nazis who carried out the attack.</p>
      <p>When he was interviewed by federal authorities in October, Tobin told them he was becoming increasingly violent and recalled a time he went to a mall in the Garden State armed with a machete.</p>
      <p>Tobin said he was enraged by the number of black people at the mall in Edison and said he wanted to “let loose” with the machete, according to NJ.com.</p>
      <p>The fire chief told the newspaper he was unaware of the allegations against Tobin and said he never had an issue with him.</p>
      <p>Tobin was ordered held without bail ahead of a detention hearing next month.</p>
