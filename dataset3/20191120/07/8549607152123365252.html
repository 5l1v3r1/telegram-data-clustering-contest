        <b>Japan may be the latest country whose central bank is looking to launch a sovereign digital currency. However, authorities in the country say there is no rush towards creating a digital Yen even as the CBDC wars appears to be gaining momentum.</b>

      <h3>BoJ Studying Modalities for Digital Yen</h3>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-kuroda-fintech/boj-conducting-research-on-digital-currency-kuroda-idUKKBN1XT06Q">report</a> on <i>Reuters </i>on Tuesday, November 19, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda stated that the central bank was not ready to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) but said that the apex bank was studying modalities for digital Yen. </p>
      <p>The central bank governor also touched on the issue of cryptocurrencies backed by assets, otherwise known as stablecoins. Kuroda speaking at the Japanese parliament, said: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“If stable coins backed by companies with a huge customer base are issued globally, that could have an impact on monetary policy and financial system stability.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Kuroda’s statement echoes an earlier sentiment shared by a former executive of the BoJ, Hiromi Yamaoka. According to Yamaoka, Facebook’s stablecoin project titled ‘<a href="https://btcmanager.com/tag/libra/">Libra</a>‘ could <a href="https://btcmanager.com/facebooks-libra-bank-japan-exec/?q=/facebooks-libra-bank-japan-exec/&amp;">threaten</a> the central banks’ control of monetary policies.</p>
      <p>However, the BoJ Chief stressed that a robust regulatory framework for such virtual currencies should be available to curtail risks. </p>
      <p>The BoJ may not be keen on issuing its CBDC at the moment, but the apex bank has not been silent on the matter either. As reported on <a href="https://btcmanager.com/japan-central-bank-releases-comprehensive-central-bank-digital-currency-report/?q=/japan-central-bank-releases-comprehensive-central-bank-digital-currency-report/&amp;q=/japan-central-bank-releases-comprehensive-central-bank-digital-currency-report/"><i>BTCManager</i></a> in February 2019, the Japanese central bank released a comprehensive report on CBDCs. The report stated that though there could be issues arising from using a CBDC, it could also make provision for a robust economy. </p>
      <h3>Central Banks Increasingly Keen on CBDCs</h3>
      <p>CBDCs are a new area that many central banks are looking to explore. Back in November 2018, former head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, advised that central banks to <a href="https://btcmanager.com/imf-lagarde-central-banks-digital-currencies/?q=/imf-lagarde-central-banks-digital-currencies/&amp;">consider</a> CBDCs, which could enable banks to gain a stronghold in the payments market. Lagarde added that CBDCs are secure, cheap, and faster. </p>
      <p>The Bank of Israel, the country’s central bank, also looked into the possibility of issuing a CBDC. but according to a report <a href="https://btcmanager.com/bank-of-israel-central-bank-digital-currencies/?q=/bank-of-israel-central-bank-digital-currencies/&amp;">released</a> by a research team in November 2018, issuing a CBDC could adversely affect Israel’s economy in a number of ways. Although the research team stated it would continue to investigate the evolving nascent technology and use cases of CBDCs abroad. </p>
      <p>While some central banks are not totally sold on the idea of a CBDC, others are of the opinion that a state-issued digital currency could benefit the economy.</p>
      <p>Rwanda’s central bank is reportedly exploring CBDC to <a href="https://btcmanager.com/rwanda-cbdc-transaction-cost-output/?q=/rwanda-cbdc-transaction-cost-output/&amp;">reduce cost</a>s and improve the payments sector. The Central Bank of the Bahamas (CBoB) <a href="https://btcmanager.com/central-bank-bahamas-launch-cbdc-2020/?q=/central-bank-bahamas-launch-cbdc-2020/&amp;">announced</a> its readiness to roll out its CBDC, called the “Project Sand Dollar” in the year 2020. </p>
      <p>Also, Turkey’s central bank, as part of its plans to stabilize the financial landscape, is looking to complete the <a href="https://btcmanager.com/turkey-national-digital-currency-in-2020/?q=/turkey-national-digital-currency-in-2020/&amp;">final testing</a> on the digital lira in 2020</p>
