      <p><a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/united-states-senate-passes-bill-supporting-human-rights-in-hong-kong-263243">US lawmakers</a> moved to prevent a crippling government shutdown Tuesday as the House of Representatives passed a short-term spending bill that funds federal operations until December 20.</p>
      <p>The Senate is expected to clear the measure later this week and send it to the White House before agencies run out of funding at midnight on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The administration has signalled that President Donald Trump will sign the so-called continuing resolution.</p>
      <p>Congress has been unable to secure a long-term deal. Democrats and Republicans have negotiated for months, but they remain at odds over the funding of Trump's long-sought wall on the US border with Mexico, among other issues.</p>
      <p>With Washington consumed by the Trump impeachment inquiry, lawmakers have expressed concern about the ability to finalize a deal in the run-up to the Christmas break.</p>
      <p>The measure gives the US military a 3.1 per cent pay raise, funds the 2020 census, and keeps critical public health programs going for another month.</p>
      <p>"While short term measures are never ideal, this extension of funding is necessary to ensure that the <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/in-policy-shift-united-states-backs-israeli-settlements-on-west-bank-263029">House and Senate</a> can continue to negotiate and reach agreement on full-year appropriations for the fiscal year 2020," House Republican Tom Cole told colleagues.</p>
      <p>The bill passed 231 to 192, with 12 Republicans supporting it in the Democratic-controlled House.</p>
      <p>Top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell said he expected a vote in coming days, saying that "failing to secure funding for the federal government before the end of the year is not an option."</p>
      <p>Two government shutdowns have occurred during Trump's administration, including a 35-day shutdown from late 2018 to early 2019, the longest in US history, over disagreements on border security.</p>
