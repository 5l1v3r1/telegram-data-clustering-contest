      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> actor David Harbour has revealed how the cast was convinced the hit show would be a complete flop before the first season dropped on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> back in 2016.</p>
      <p>The Jim Hopper star confessed on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that he believed that the science-fiction drama was going to be a ‘disaster’ and worried even more over the lack of promotion for the series.</p>
      <p>‘I was sure it was gonna be a complete disaster and a big failure before it came out,’ David admitted.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I remember when we were shooting, too, we would all sit around talking about how terrible it was gonna be, mainly because of my performance.’</p>
      <p>David, who’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/lily-allen-facetiming-david-harbour-night-paris-just-cutest-thing-11125435/">currently all loved up with Lily Allen</a>,  continued: ‘I thought I was tanking the whole show. And then, before it came out, you normally see things on buses. I live in New York, I’m wandering around, buses, phone booths, there are ads for shows. Not a single ad.</p>
      <p>‘Three weeks before the show, a week before the show, and I was doing a play with a friend of mine who’s on a very successful television program, and I said to him, “No ads, no ads. I guess they’re doing some kind of new campaign.” He said, “No, they’re burying the show.”</p>
      <p>‘And I said, “What does that mean, burying the show? I don’t understand your television lingo.” And he said, “They hate the show, they’re trying to make sure no one watches it.”‘</p>

      <p>But obviously, when the Netflix show came out, it was a completely different story.</p>
      <p>‘And then the show came out and it was an overnight zeitgeist success.’ David recalled. ‘I really thought it was gonna be nothing and then people sort of embraced it and it became this grassroots event and it’s very gratifying.’</p>

      <p>David’s character Hopper was left in a compromising position at the end of Stranger Things 3 and nobody knows whether he’s alive or not – not even David.</p>
      <p>Last month, the star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/stranger-things-star-david-harbour-demands-answers-ahead-season-4-hopper-dead-10884460/">demanded answers from the Duffer brothers</a> about whether or not he’ll be returning for the fourth season.</p>
      <p>We’ve got our fingers crossed.</p>
