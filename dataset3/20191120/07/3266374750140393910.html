      <h1>Official: Tottenham Hotspur confirm Jose Mourinho appointment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:38:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/varun-madhav/" target="_blank">Keshav Awasty</a></address>
      <h3>Jose Mourinho has returned to management, with Tottenham officially appointing the Portuguese tactician as their new head coach.</h3>
      <p>Tottenham have made an <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">official statement</a> to confirm that they have appointed Jose Mourinho as their new head coach, having parted ways with Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday. The Portugal manager has signed a three-and-a-half year contract with the North London club, which runs till the end of the 2022-23 season.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho has been one of the best managers of the 21st century, having enjoyed success at some level with just about every club that he taken charge of. In what has been a storied managerial career, Mourinho has won 25 trophies with five different clubs, including two Champions League triumphs.</p>

      <p>But, the notorious Portuguese tactician has been out of a job since being <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2018/12/18/official-manchester-united-sack-jose-mourinho/">terminated from his deal with Manchester United last December</a>, after what had then been their worst ever start to a Premier League season. Now, though, Mourinho is back in the game, with Tottenham appointing him as their new manager.</p>
      <p>The North London club have endured a dreadful start to the 2019-20 season, which has sent them languishing at 12th on the Premier League table after the first 12 gameweeks. Spurs have also been miserable on the road, failing to win a single away game in 2019.</p>
      <p>And so, despite enjoying their best phase in the modern era under Mauricio Pochettino, under whom they had established themselves as Champions League regulars, <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/mauricio-leaves-club/">the Argentine and his staff were relieved of their duties on Tuesday night</a>. Tottenham, though, have not waited long to confirm Pochettino’s replacement.</p>

      <p>Mourinho has been named as the new Tottenham manager, mere hours after the announcement of Pochettinho’s dismissal. The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss takes charge of his third Premier League club and expressed his delight at joining the North Londoners.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has signed a three-and-a-half-year deal with Tottenham, which will take him to the 2022-23 season. His job now will be to restore Spurs’ status as one of the best clubs in the Premier League and one can be sure that he will be eager to boost his stock as well, having seen his Manchester United spell end in tumultuous fashion.</p>
