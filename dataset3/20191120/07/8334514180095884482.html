      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Bank Hapoalim (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/POLI.TA">POLI.TA</a>), Israel’s largest lender, reported on Wednesday a 22.5% drop in third quarter net profit after it chose to accelerate the sale of its business in Turkey and due to the impact of a negative consumer price index.</p>
      <p>The bank said its quarterly net profit totaled 736 million shekels ($213 million), down from 950 million shekels a year earlier.</p>
      <p>It recorded a loss of impairment of about 63 million shekels from its investment in Bank Pozitif in Turkey. Excluding this, net profit would have totaled 798 million shekels.</p>
      <p>Income from regular financing activity rose 1.3% to 2.4 billion shekels in the quarter. But that was hindered by a negative consumer price index that resulted in an expense of 76 million shekels compared with income of 19 million a year earlier, the bank said.</p>
      <p>Fees and other income slipped 1.1%.</p>
      <p>Hapoalim distributed a 1 billion shekel dividend from a capital surplus generated from the sale of a 65% stake in credit card business Isracard (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ISCD.TA">ISCD.TA</a>).</p>
      <p>Hapoalim has undergone a management shake-up, and its new chief executive, Dov Kotler, took office on Oct. 1.</p>
