      <h1>Vegan outcry forces vet school to nix nude calendar photo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:48:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:48</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>An outcry by vegan activists forced a veterinary college in England to pull a photo from their calendar that showed a number of students posing nude with sheep, a report said.</p>
      <p>The racy photo shows seven male students from the Royal Veterinary College in London holding the farm animals over their bare private parts, using an animal-handling method known as “tipping,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/college-apologises-after-vegan-outcry-over-use-of-sheep-in-naked-calendar">the Guardian reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The image <a href="https://www.facebook.com/veterinaryvegannetwork/">sparked a backlash online</a> after the Veterinary Vegan Network condemned it in a since-deleted Facebook post, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The vegan group called the photo “deeply disturbing” — and the president of the school agreed to take it out of the calendar.</p>
      <p>Some of the students in the photo had received threats online after the photo was circulated, Stuart Reid, the college’s principal said.</p>
      <p>“To those who have taken offense at the calendar, I apologize. It may have fallen short of the standards some expect in terms of animal welfare, but that responsibility is mine,” Reid said in a statement after the controversy, according to the Guardian.</p>
      <p>“The complaints and attacks should be directed to me and me alone,” he added.</p>
