      <p>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) — The Gonzaga crowd roared when Killian Tillie was announced in the starting lineup Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It boomed again when Tillie sank a 3-pointer for the Zags’ first points.</p>
      <p>“It felt good,” said Tillie, who finished with 15 points and eight rebounds as No. 8 Gonzaga held off Texas-Arlington 72-66.</p>
      <p>“I needed that 3,” he added.</p>
      <p>Ryan Woolridge had 19 points and nine rebounds for Gonzaga (5-0), while Admon Gilder added 15 points and Filip Petrusev had 10.</p>
      <p>Tillie sat out much of last season with injuries and missed the first four games of this season while recovering from knee surgery.</p>
      <p>“I’m a little tired and out of shape,” Tillie said. “I tried to step up and make some points.”</p>
      <p>This proved to be the toughest test of the young season for the Zags.</p>
      <p>Texas-Arlington played stout defense and made some big shots at the end to stay close.</p>
      <p>“At times we responded well and other times we didn’t,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said, pointing to four 3-pointers by Texas-Arlington in the closing minutes.</p>
      <p>“We are definitely a work in progress,” Few said after the Bulldogs, one of the best-shooting teams in the country, were held to 39% from the field.</p>
      <p>Woolridge, a graduate transfer from North Texas, had his best game as a Bulldog.</p>
      <p>“He’s a heck of a competitor,” Few said. “He gives you everything when he is out on the floor.”</p>
      <p>Gonzaga has won 26 consecutive home games.</p>
      <p>Jabari Narcis scored 16 points for Texas-Arlington (2-3), sinking all five of his 3-point attempts. Brian Warren and David Azore scored 15 points each for the Mavericks, who lost at No. 11 Oregon 67-47 on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to take away their inside guys and take our chances against their shooters,” Texas-Arlington coach Chris Ogden said. “Very proud of our team.”</p>
      <p>“I’ve seen improvement out of these guys every game,” Ogden said. “Tonight we came out and played like we expected to win the game.”</p>
      <p>Gonzaga led by two when Texas-Arlington made three straight 3-pointers, two by Narcis, to take a 22-15 lead in the first half. Gonzaga made just six of its first 21 shots (28.6%).</p>
      <p>Gonzaga used a 13-5 run to take a 28-27 lead at halftime. Woolridge scored the final seven points for Gonzaga, including a layup at the buzzer for the lead.</p>
      <p>The pace picked up in the second half, with Gonzaga leading 40-37 in the opening minutes behind six points from Woolridge.</p>
      <p>Gonzaga went on a 13-4 run for a 53-41 lead, but six straight points brought the Mavericks within 53-47 with 8 minutes left.</p>
      <p>Five points by Woolridge helped push Gonzaga’s lead to 59-49.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks got within 69-63 behind eight points by Azore, but they were forced to foul as time ran down.</p>
      <p><b>3-POINT SHOOTIN</b>G</p>
      <p>Gonzaga made just 5 of 22 from 3-point range (22.7%). Texas-Arlington made 11 of 26 (42.3%).</p>
      <p>“We have guys that can hit the 3,” Ogden said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>INSIDE GAME</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gonzaga won the rebound battle 45-33 and outscored the Mavericks in the paint 36-12. The Mavericks blocked five shots.</p>
      <p>
        <b>BIG PICTURE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Texas-Arlington: The Mavericks average just 69 points per game, 26 fewer than Gonzaga. They allow 64 ppg. The Mavericks are ninth in the nation with 137 3-point attempts. They beat the Bulldogs in their first meeting in 1992.</p>
      <p>Gonzaga: The Bulldogs are one of six teams in the nation to start the past four seasons 4-0. Gonzaga came in second in the nation in field goal shooting at 56.6% and in victory margin at 35.5 points. Tuesday night was the 15th anniversary of the opening of the McCarthey Athletic Center, and the Bulldogs are 210-15 at home, with every game sold-out.</p>
