      <p>The Indian Rupee stalled its recovery from three-day lows vs, the US dollar, as the USD/INR bears take a breather near 71.75 region, at the press time.</p>
      <p>The spot hit a low of 71.65 last hour after the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/usdinr">Indian currency</a> was boosted on the extended foreign inflows, in the wake of ArcelorMittal's takeover of Essar Steel. However, the downside in USD/INR remains cushioned by the increased safe-haven demand for the US dollar across its main competitors amid renewed US-China tensions led risk-aversion.</p>
      <p>Apart from the ongoing US-China trade uncertainty, fresh trouble brewed between both the countries on the political front after the US Senate approved the Hong Kong human rights bill late-Tuesday. Beijing threatened to retaliate against the US political meddling into Chinese domestic affairs.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, the pair will remain at the mercy of the USD price-action and risk trends amid US-China political woes and ahead of the key <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> Oct meeting’s minutes that could throw fresh light on the US interest rates outlook amid growing overseas risks.</p>
