      <p>Bafana Bafana goalscorer, Lebogang Phiri, has praised the new head coach for his role in South Africa’s 2021 African Cup of Nations qualifier against Sudan over the weekend. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Phiri got his first competitive goal for Bafana when he rifled home from just inside the box towards the end of the first half, and he was a bit higher up the pitch than he’s used to playing during his time with his club, EA Guingamp. </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is utilised as a defensive midfielder in France at Guingamp in a role that he has made his own at the club since his arrival from Brondby, but he enjoyed the attacking role that Molefi Ntseki gave to him against the Sudanese, especially given the fact that he got on the scoresheet. </p>
      <p>Speaking about his positioning in Sunday’s AFCON qualifier, ‘Lebhino’ told the media, “It’s been while since I’ve played in such an offensive role… At club level I play as a defensive six because I’m a ball player, but today the coach felt believed needed a different element in the game, and he put me in there. He gave me confidence and I did my level best - I gave numbers going forward and tried in the defensive work as well when we lost the ball.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Having bided his time waiting for his first competitive start for Bafana, Phiri will be hoping that he’s done enough to secure his spot in Ntseki’s next squad when it rolls around in March for their first 2022 World Cup qualifiers, and his fine strike will not have done his chances any harm. </p>
