      <h1>[Update: 5G variant] Galaxy Fold gets the November security update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:00:30+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>Samsung has released a new update for the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-fold/">Galaxy Fold</a>. The update brings the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-monthly-updates-november-2019-security-patch-detailed/">November 2019 security patch</a> to the LTE variant of the foldable device in France and should be rolling out in other countries soon. Just how soon Samsung will release the update for the 5G variant remains to be seen; the company has been quite flippant in supporting the Galaxy Fold as well as <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/opinions/2100-euros-dont-expect-samsung-care-much-about-galaxy-fold/">it should be given the price tag</a>, and only time will tell if things will change.</p>
      <p>The LTE variant of the Galaxy Fold has been treated better than the 5G variant, but Samsung continues to focus its efforts on the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 as far as software updates are concerned. Both non-folding flagships received the November security update <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s10-november-security-update-now-widely-available/">nearly two weeks ago</a>. Furthermore, an update that brought Galaxy Note 10 features to the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Fold was <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/latest-galaxy-s10-software-update-note10-camera-features/">also released much earlier</a> for the former <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-fold-gets-galaxy-note-10-camera-features-in-new-update/">than it was for the latter</a>.</p>
      <p>In any case, the November update, which doesn’t bring any new features, is now available for the Galaxy Fold. It sports software version <b>F900FXXS2ASK1</b> and it can be download over the air from the device’s <i>Settings » Software update</i> menu. You can also upgrade your Fold via Samsung’s Smart Switch program for Windows and Mac or by downloading the latest firmware <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-fold/firmware/SM-F900F/">from our firmware archive</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Update</b>: The update is now <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/galaxy-fold-5g/firmware/SM-F907B/">available for the Galaxy Fold 5G</a>. It is rolling out in Switzerland at this time as a ~200 MB download and should be coming to other markets soon.</p>
