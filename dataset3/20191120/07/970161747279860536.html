        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> will have been planning to hire <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> as manager ‘for some time now’ believes former Scotland striker Ally McCoist.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mourinho confirmed the appointment of the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> manager on Wednesday morning, after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The rapid turnaround makes McCoist believe that Mourinho had been waiting in the wings for a while before taking over at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>‘It’s one of these that you’re half of expecting it but still reasonably shocked and surprised when it happens,’ McCoist told talkSPORT.</p>
      <p>‘Obviously they’ve had this plan for some time now, you don’t just sack somebody and appoint somebody within 24 hours if you’ve not got a plan.’</p>
      <p>The Rangers legend is a big fan of the Portuguese manager but noted that he would bring a completely different approach to his predecessor at Spurs, which could ruffle feathers in north London.</p>

      <p>‘I’m interested in the contrasting styles of both managers,’ McCoist continued. ‘There’s one thing with Mourinho, he’s an absolute winner, I love him.</p>
      <p>‘It’ll be interesting to see how the players handle it because, make no mistake about it, they are completely different characters, Pochettino and Mourinho.</p>
      <p>‘One thing Spurs supporters will know they are getting is a man with a ruthless streak that wins things, he did it at United as well.</p>
      <p>‘He went on record and said one of his biggest achievements was at United, finishing second, which raised a few eyebrows, but you look back now and it makes a lot of sense.’</p>
      <p>TalkSPORT host Alan Brazil noted believes that Mourinho may well have a more settled time at Spurs than at Manchester United, due to already having a home in London and loving the city.</p>
      <p>‘He loves London, by the way,’ said Brazil. ‘Nothing wrong with Manchester, but he was away from his family, London is his home.’</p>
