      <p>Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday said in Rajya Sabha that the government will restore<br/>Internet connection in Kashmir as soon as the local administration feels it is fit to do so.</p>
      <p>Responding to a series of questions on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir during Question Hour, Shah also asserted that not a single person has died in police firing after August 5 when the special status accorded to Jammu and Kashmir was scrapped.</p>
