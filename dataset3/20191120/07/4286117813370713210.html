      <p>A group of students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) met a panel of HRD ministry officials on Wednesday morning, days after the clashes with Delhi Police personnel, and told the officials about the brutal police action.</p>
      <p>Coming out of the meeting, JNUSU member Apeksha said, "The HRD ministry officials gave us a patient hearing. We informed them that the protests will go on and we want a meeting with the Vice-Chancellor."</p>
      <p>She added, "We also sought action against the police."</p>
      <p>According to sources from inside the meeting between Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) office-bearers and HRD ministry officials, the students spoke at length about the Vice-Chancellor of the university being unavailable and unresponsive to their needs.</p>
      <p>The students also gave out details of the alleged lathicharge done by Delhi Police personnel when the protesting JNU students were marching towards the Parliament on Monday.</p>
      <p>The meeting between JNU students and government officials started around 10.30 am on Wednesday and the students' union office-bearers are attending it along with the student councillors from different schools.</p>
      <p>The JNU students have been protesting for over three weeks against a draft hostel manual, which has provisions for hostel fee hike, dress code and curfew timings.</p>
      <p>The HRD Ministry had on Monday constituted the three-member committee to recommend ways to restore normal functioning of the JNU.</p>
      <p>A day after accusing the police of baton-charging them for protesting on the streets of Delhi against hostel fee hike, students of Jawaharlal Nehru University alleged that even physically challenged protesters were not spared and women were groped and manhandled.</p>
      <p>The police, however, have denied lathicharging, using tear gas or any form of violence against students.</p>
      <p>Shashibhushan Pandey, a visually challenged student, claimed that police beat him up even when he told them he is "differently abled", while JNU Students' Union president Aishe Ghosh alleged that women students were "manhandled and groped" by male policemen.</p>
