      <h1>â€˜Fuel to the Klopp-Guardiola fightâ€¦â€™ Fans react differently to Mourinho Spurs appointment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:57:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>It will be that much more satisfying to win the Premier League if Jose Mourinho is in charge of a side below us, right?!</p>
      <p>Weâ€™ve already faced Spurs once â€“ so will only have to play Tottenham, whoâ€™ve just appointed the Portuguese having sacked Mauricio Pochettino last night, one more time â€“ on January 11.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Twitter has exploded following the news, with multiple comments regarding Mourinhoâ€™s old/new rivalry with Jurgen Klopp circling.</p>
      <p>Many are just glad to see them both competing again, alongside Pep Guardiola â€“ in whatâ€™s the holy trinity of the â€˜Big Bossesâ€™ right now.</p>
      <p>Others oddly think Mou could do some damage in the title race, but heâ€™s just as likely to hurt our rivals as us.</p>
      <p>Some think Mourinhoâ€™s tepid style of football shouldnâ€™t be overlooked just because his ego is box-officeâ€¦</p>
      <p>To be honest, itâ€™s pretty exciting â€“ and could actually take some of the attention off Liverpoolâ€™s title surge for a good few weeks â€“ which weâ€™d appreciate.</p>
      <blockquote>Every news channel in the world is just talking about this Jose mourinhoâ€™s appointment with Tottenham hotspurâ€¦Football is back,banter is backâ€¦now we can sit down and watch Klopp,pep and Jose entertain usâ€¦grab your popcorn<br/>â€” NICK.ðŸ’¨ (@nickslimee) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickslimee/status/1197048123782238209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Jose Mourinho is back to the EPL as Tottenham Hotspur Manager.<br/>Let us add fuel to the Klopp-Guardiola fight. They now have a common enemy.

      <blockquote>I suspect Jose Mourinho had other suitors and Spurs were forced to move; the timing of all this reeks of how Liverpool let Brendan Rodgers go so as to get Jurgen Klopp before anyone else.<br/>Whether it's the right decision, time will tell<br/>â€” Mike Njoroge (@Mikenjoro) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mikenjoro/status/1197050820904312833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Ndombele, Winks, Eriksen, Son, Moura, Dele and Kane under Jose Mourinho. <br/>The Premier League isn't ready.

      <blockquote>When Liverpool lost the champions league final, was Klopp sacked? Did the players or fans want him out? No, they knuckled down and won it the very next year. <br/>Be careful what you wish for Tottenham. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pochettino?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Pochettino</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mourinho?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Mourinho</a> <a href="https://t.co/2UD3ixw1vh">pic.twitter.com/2UD3ixw1vh<br/></a>â€” Dave Firth (@fuse7777) <a href="https://twitter.com/fuse7777/status/1197052831871705088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Both Mourinho and Klopp in the league to torment Pep, you love to see it<br/>â€” #freekeita (@marcoparco8) <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoparco8/status/1197055470705561601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <blockquote>Iâ€™m not feeling it about Mourinho, despite his record. He was peak 10 years ago but nowhere near where Klopp/Pep et al are at. I hope Iâ€™m proved wrong but his last Chelsea/Man U teams almost bored me to death along with his miserable whinging. Time will tellâ€¦..<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/spurs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#spurs<br/></a>â€” David Crowley (@DavidCrowley76) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidCrowley76/status/1197052871801540608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>

      <blockquote>Sad to see Poch go but Mourinho has that cheeky spark back in his eyes. You can see it when he's commentating. Serial winner, probably wants to prove a point against Pep and Klopp. Get him in ASAP. Anything else would be a huge step back <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COYS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#COYS<br/></a>â€” Nathan Geen (@nathangeen) <a href="https://twitter.com/nathangeen/status/1196889360790102021?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2019</a></blockquote>
