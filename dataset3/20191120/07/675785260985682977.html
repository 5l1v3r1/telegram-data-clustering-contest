      <h1>CM Punk explains truth behind WWE return after making backstage debut</h1>
      <h2>CM Punk admitted there is a long way to go before he can think about making a return to the ring</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:53:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:53</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>CM Punk has revealed he has no relationship with the WWE and has only returned to the fold with broadcaster FOX.</p>
      <p>The former wrestler and UFC fighter made a surprise appearance last week to spark claims he would soon return to the ring.</p>
      <p>But speaking on <i>WWE Backstage</i> on Tuesday night, CM Punk - real name Phillip Brooks - explained his real role.</p>
      <p>"I do not work with, have any relationship with and have not talked to anyone at WWE. It’s strictly a Fox thing. I get to criticise the product," he said.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think this job existed six months ago. Somebody floated the idea and I didn’t immediately go, 'Ugh, no'.</p>

      <p>"I work for Fox. I haven’t talked to anybody in the WWE. It’s nothing I’m actively pursuing or interested in. But I’m 41 years old and I’ve lived an experienced life where I know to not say no.</p>
      <p>"That’s going to be a bridge that has to be built and it might take as long as building the Great Wall of China. There are some hurdles."</p>
      <p>Punk's 434-day WWE Championship reign remains one of the longest in the company's history before he retired in 2014.</p>
      <p>But UFC career was a short-lived disaster as he lost twice, first by first-round submission to Mickey Gall in 2016 and then by unanimous decision to Mike Jackson two years later.</p>
