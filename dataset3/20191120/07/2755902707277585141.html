      <p>As the country’s health sector continues to deteriorate badly, pregnant women have been hit the hardest. Due to the closing down of Council Clinics following a strike by nurses and doctors, many expecting mothers have been left with no choice but to turn to the services of private hospitals and clinics.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, most of the fees being charged by private hospitals and clinics are beyond the reach of many expecting mothers, a development which has resulted in an increase in home deliveries. Recently, a Mbare based midwife, Gogo Esther Gwena, made headlines after <b><a href="https://iharare.com/gogo-gwena-delivers-over-100-babies-in-1-week/">she delivered more than 100 babies in just one week</a></b> at her humble home. This <b><a href="https://iharare.com/mbare-gogo-who-delivered-100-babies/">merited a visit from First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa</a></b> who donated some commodities to Gogo Gwena.</p>
      <p>The Harare Residents Trust (HRT) carried out a survey yesterday to establish the cheapest fees being charged by private hospitals and clinics for pregnant and expecting mothers. The results do not make for good reading when the average salaries for formally employed people are taken into account.</p>
      <p>Below are the results of the <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/HRTzim/posts/2628929707153557?__xts__[0]=68.ARA8IX_lnSTHQSPUuKy_Xr4GEZWJpsxC_wmen1OuUESOWns2QoUOTyosernhv6-MvfUSGATexMhV2i-LI2FDRoF76vnEdmKnNQUgkmXg2wzBij4yfxvzG2AWhOwYYyepV3B9E4GMVYEpFvwx-eHILy3DcEpGmIYCLOFgxFW_HiuUlbkgJCu05c1eM3cNCkHUaDyMSXKO21Lc4_LvUMtd22CFfXKAW7pk0dhfWbLIc6KCcb78kdlIyUPTRxoSfLTl0NRO7_ZFhaaw_A61X1IjCAZVSmtCqBg0veJ1SI0w0i6vVBQBC3dts680syqc-ksRbUhnC74BATF3fXmWnxyw8Q&amp;__xts__[1]=68.ARBzhn-IKIdZ0UzrsKloaxvx7PR0Jtvlsh5Xp6FtUt_fEQ9g4UkaD6Z8JE-v7apx7dzXLKfvrORILT4vzoVNvRtfXFFl_ri7Ll2xS5X6LIqCmJSbXfcq8cHwVrkSpXA1Q4jRrfx_3qrpXrqr_FwMs1kilZdH3Auos3uh2P7vNTMtsXT9wu9iF75Vp3BtBj5tGdmFxYUWdqyDFBaAVzINa-62Ho06CY-VfZX1NWIZoGiSO-zK16pRTRnmxrFpPpVRobvu3ChNcCcx6f5Z3UvnvLTkBKJ53tb6T7rzZgKoK-TMzcKKq30rhrbF-fzh8ex62nS7HWey9fxohb9YhIJmUw&amp;__tn__=-R">HRT Survey</a></b>,</p>
