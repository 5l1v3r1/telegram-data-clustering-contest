      <h2>Mayweather has not fought professionally since he stopped Conor McGregor in the 10th round in 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:21:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:21</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Floyd Mayweather has insisted he will not return to the professional ring.</p>
      <p>The boxing legend has not fought since he stopped <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a> in the 10th round in 2017.</p>
      <p>He retired for the second time but returned to stop Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in the first round of their exhibition clash on New Year's Day last year.</p>
      <p>And while Mayweather has not ruled out another such bout, he claims he will not rematch old rival Manny Pacquiao.</p>
      <p>"I've got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth," he told Reuters.</p>

      <p>"Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle.</p>
      <p>"You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career.</p>
      <p>"I'll still travel and do exhibitions. I make great money doing exhibitions; between $10 and $30 million.</p>
      <p>"I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting."</p>
      <p>Despite the rise of mixed martial arts and other combat sports, Mayweather said boxing reigns supreme because of its rich history and ability to produce legendary champions.</p>
      <p>"I never call myself a celebrity," he said. "I'm a legendary icon because when I'm long gone they will still be talking about me."</p>

      <p>Mayweather said that when he boxed McGregor, it was the most money any MMA fighter had ever earned for a single fight.</p>
      <p>"We gave the MMA sport a boost," he added. "Eventually I will move on to build my brand in MMA but for right now I'm in boxing, and boxing will always be at the top as long as I'm involved."</p>
      <p>If it truly is the end of the road for Mayweather as a boxer, he said he leaves with no regrets.</p>
      <p>"My career went great," he said. "I'm happy with how everything played out.</p>
