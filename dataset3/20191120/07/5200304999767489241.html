      <p>Vikram Bhatt’s forthcoming film that was announced in March this year with none other than television sensation Hina Khan has been wrapped and the film is all set to release on 31st January.</p>
      <p>‘Hacked’ is an edge of the seat gripping thriller and as the name suggests, it explores a very topical issue – the dark side of the digital and the social media world.</p>
      <p>The film throws light on cybercrime and shows how putting out everything, there can be dangerous.</p>
      <p>Khan will be seen in a glamorous avatar of an editor of a fashion magazine in the film.</p>
      <p>The film has been in news for its interesting concept and is surely awaited among fans of Khan and Bhatt.</p>
      <p>After giving hits like ‘Kasoor’, ‘Ghulam’, ‘Raaz’ and ‘Awara Pagal Dewana’, the director, producer and screenwriter Bhatt started the trend of Horror films with his film ‘1920’.</p>
      <p>‘Hacked’ is however not a horror film but a thriller says Bhatt.</p>
      <p>“Hacked is about the perils of our online lives and talks about how in today’s time everything about everyone is just a click away, nothing remains exclusive or private.” Says the filmmaker.</p>
      <p>Presented by Loneranger Productions and produced by Amar P. Thakkar and Krishna Bhatt, ‘Hacked’ is directed by Vikram Bhatt. Starring Hina Khan, Rohan Shah, Mohit Malhotra, Sid Makkar, the film will release in cinemas on 31st January 2020.</p>
