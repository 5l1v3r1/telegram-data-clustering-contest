      <h1>Stadia uses even more data than we expected</h1>

        <b>Google’s big streaming project has landed, and the Stadia reviews are here. In short, it’s good tech paired with a questionable service, but there’s still one big outstanding question: just how much data are these streams going to use? A rough estimate from early stats suggested that Stadia would use around 15.75GB per hour of 4K gameplay, but it seems even that was a bit conservative.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Google now warns that Stadia’s video can use up to 20GB of data per hour for 4K, 60fps video. But what about lower resolutions? <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/19/google-stadia-data-usage/">GamesBeat</a> tested the service at 1080p 60fps, and found that it used 119MB per minute, which would make just over 7GB per hour. <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/google-stadia-bandwidth-data-use-data-plan/">Digital Trends</a>’ test on a Pixel 3a – which boasts a roughly 1080p screen – used up 10.2GB per hour.</p>
      <p>While early worries over <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/stadia/data-caps">Stadia’s data cap</a> problems were tempered with the fact that we didn’t actually know how the platform would use data in the real world – but the numbers don’t look great.</p>
      <p>For comparison, Netflix’s <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87">official help site</a> suggests that it uses around 3GB per hour of HD video.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/stream-games-google-stadia-streaming-alternatives">Stadia streaming alternatives</a> have been around for ages, and new services like Microsoft’s xCloud are on the horizon. Whether any of them – or Stadia itself – manages to break through the streaming barrier remains to be seen.</p>
