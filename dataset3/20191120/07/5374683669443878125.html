      <h2>Leaders of Israel's seven universities express outrage over University of Toronto's Graduate Student Union's rejection of kosher food bid.</h2>

      <p>The leaders of Israel’s seven universities are expressing their outrage over the University of Toronto’s Graduate Student Union conflating a kosher food program with support for Israel.</p>
      <p>“Just when we thought that we’d seen it all regarding the ascent of anti-Semitism masquerading as anti-Zionism on campus, the Graduate Student Union at the University of Toronto (U of T) took this theater of the absurd to new heights by characterizing kosher food as ‘pro-Israel,’” Ron Robin, chairman of the Committee of University Heads of Israel, said in a statement released Tuesday. Robin is president of the University of Haifa.</p>
      <p>The Graduate Student Union’s external commissioner, in response to a Jewish student’s request for the union to officially support the Kosher Forward Campaign, suggested that the Executive Committee might be reluctant to advance such a motion to its board of directors. The commissioner said since Hillel is “pro-Israel,” supporting the motion would go against the “will of the membership.”</p>
      <p>The union later apologized for “unintentionally caus(ing) harm toward the Jewish community.”</p>
      <p>In 2012, the union voted to support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS, movement against Israel.</p>
      <p>“(T)he classification of kosher food as ‘pro-Israel’ illustrates just how far the BDS movement has come in terms of zeroing in on its actual objective — suppressing the freedom of speech and freedom of religion of Jews, not merely leveling criticism at the State of Israel and its policies,” Robin said.</p>
      <p>The committee is made up of the presidents, rectors and directors-general of the Israeli universities.</p>
