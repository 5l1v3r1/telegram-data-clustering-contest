      <h1>Automatically Detect Computer Generated Text With This Chrome Extension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/beth-skwarecki" target="_blank">Beth Skwarecki</a></address>
      <p>Artificial intelligence systems can write pretty convincingly readable text these days. A new browser extension, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/Gptrue%20or%20false">GPTrue or False</a>, can test whether a given text is likely to have been generated by an AI.</p>

      <p>The extension (by Guilio Starace and available for both <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gptrue-or-false/bikcfchmnacmfhneafnpfekgfhckplfj">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/Gptrue%20or%20false">Firefox</a>) works by using OpenAI’s GPT-2 text generator and checking whether the generator’s output is similar to the text you are curious about. If you’d rather not install a browser extension, you can paste text into <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai-detector/">this webpage</a> instead.</p>
      <p>It works best with text that comes from GPT-2, but Janelle Shane tested it on some other types of AI-generated text and found that it detects them pretty well. (Shane is a <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/07/we-trained-an-ai-to-generate-lifehacker-headlines">noted AI wrangler</a>, and author of a new book on artificial intelligence called <i>You Look Like a Thing and I Love You</i>. An AI is responsible for that title.)</p>

      <p>The extension identified posts I’ve personally written as <i>not</i> AI-generated. (Phew, I’m not secretly a computer!) I also tried it on the Lifehacker headlines I generated in <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/07/we-trained-an-ai-to-generate-lifehacker-headlines">this AI experiment</a> (“The Best Way to Buy a Job Interview,” “How to Make Your Own Podcast Bar”), and it correctly identified them as computer generated. Give it a try and see what you find!</p>
