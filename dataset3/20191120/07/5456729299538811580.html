      <p>The crises between the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Saliu Adetunji, and his High chiefs was put to rest on Tuesday when the state government withdrew their crowns as part of the condition to settle out of court.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES recalls that the Olubadan and some of his chiefs, among whom are the Otun Olubadan, Lekan Balogun, Balogun of Ibadan land, Owolabi Olakulehin and others who are also members of the Olubadan-In-Council had in the last two years been engaged in a conflict.</p>
      <p>The crisis reached its peak in August 2017 when the immediate past governor, Abiola Ajimobi, presented staffs of office to about 21 chiefs who were promoted to the status of kings.</p>
      <p>Eminent personalities, indigenes of Ibadan, clubs and societies in the ancient city including former President Olusegun Obasanjo had tried to wade into the conflict but were unsuccessful.</p>

      <p>The crisis was, however, laid to rest on Tuesday when Mr Ajimobi’s successor, Seyi Makinde, withdrew the crowns of the officials as part of the condition to settle out of court.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the Court of Appeal in Ibadan had on August 23 this year referred parties in the controversial coronation to a lower court.</p>
      <p>Mr Makinde had opted for an out-of-court settlement to restore peace between the Olubadan and his estranged chiefs.</p>
      <p>The appellate court ordered that the case be returned for trial before another judge of the state High Court.</p>

      <p>But, the parties reached agreement on Tuesday when the state High Court in a suit number M/317/2017 filed by Rashidi Ladoja pronounced that the parties in the suit have met and agreed.</p>
