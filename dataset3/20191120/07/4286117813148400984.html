      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sena's Priyanka Chaturvedi slams police action against students</li>
        <li>Says fairness of protesting fee hike debatable</li>
        <li>Shiv Sena, BJP fell out after recent Maharashtra state election</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What does the Shiv Sena, until recently a coalition partner in the Modi government, make of the ongoing protests at Jawaharlal Nehru University?</p>
      <p>One of its highest-ranking members, deputy leader Priyanka Chaturvedi, thinks they're valid as long as they're peaceful.</p>
      <p>What about the fact that they're trying get a hostel fee hike rolled back?</p>
      <p>In a tweet she posted on Wednesday, Chaturvedi said the fairness of the motive was "debatable", but "for the Delhi police to resort to violent lathi charge to stop the protests is sign of a system that is unable to handle dissent".</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>

      <p>Until recently, the Shiv Sena and the BJP were partners in government, both in Maharashtra and at the Centre. They even won an October state election together.</p>
      <p>But they disagreed on the idea of sharing the chief minister's job using a rotation policy, and fell out bitterly. Arvind Sawant, the Shiv Sena minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, resigned.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra is now under President's Rule. But the Shiv Sena, which is working on a prospective alliance with the Congress and the NCP, says it expects to form a government <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/shiv-sena-sanjay-raut-exclusive-maharashtra-government-formation-1620015-2019-11-18">by early December</a>.</p>
