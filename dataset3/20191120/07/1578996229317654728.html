      <h3>November 20, 2019</h3>
      <p>Been frustrated by finances recently? You can blame messenger Mercury, which has been retrograde in your cashflow zone since October 31. It’s possible that you needed to significantly curtail your spending during this penny-pinching cycle. Thankfully, you’ll be back on track starting today, as Mercury FINALLY resumes forward motion. But before you go repeating all your past monetary mistakes, stop and think: What did you learn over the past three weeks? Apply these economic lessons to your financial future. Draw up a smarter budget for 2020, so you can prosper in the New Year!</p>
