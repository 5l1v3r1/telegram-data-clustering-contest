      <h2>There is a warning that there are three branches in Wales not taking part</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:01:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:01</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, Cathy Owen</a></address>
      <p>McDonald's has announced it'll be giving away free fries for one day on Friday.</p>
      <p>The fast-food giant is known for its freebies, and this week is no different as you'll be able to get your hands on some fries for absolutely nothing.</p>
      <p>It happens on Friday, November 22, where medium portions of he brand's famous chips will be completely free via the McDonald's app, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mcdonalds-chips-free-friday-one-20915349?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=mirror_main">The Mirror</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Each customer can claim one pack each, with no purchase necessary, but rather than heading up to the counter or self-serve screens like normal, to get the freebie, you'll need to make sure you place your order via the McDonald's app.</p>
      <p>The offer is available to all new and existing McDonald's app customers, in selected branches. Unfortunately, some branches are not taking part in the offer.</p>

      <p>As usual, to complete registration, new users must go into the restaurant for their first order – otherwise this offer works for click and collect, through the Drive Thru and from this week, for orders placed and delivered directly to your table thanks to the nationwide introduction of Table Markers.</p>
      <p>Table Markers, as the name suggests, means that customers can find a table, order through their phone and have their food delivered straight to where they’re sat.</p>
      <p>In Wales, the offer is not available at outlets in Llandudno, the Asda at Newport, Swansea's Morfa shopping park.</p>
