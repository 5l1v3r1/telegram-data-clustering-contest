      <h1>Adelaide swelters but misses Nov record</h1>

      <p>Adelaide has fallen just short of setting a November temperature record as South Australia sweltered through a day of scorching temperatures and dangerous bushfires.</p>
      <p>Late on Wednesday after the Country Fire Service continued to fight a number of fires across the state, with emergency warning messages in place for some centres.</p>
      <p>The hot dry northerly winds that fanned the flames also sent temperatures in some regional towns soaring.</p>
      <p>Nullarbor and Ceduna, on SA's west coast, were the hottest with tops of 46.6C and 46.2C respectively while Port Augusta had 45.1C and Renmark 45C.</p>
      <p>Nullarbor's maximum was a November record, but it wasn't alone with a string of other towns posting their hottest temperatures for this time of the year.</p>
      <p>Among those were Keith (44.3C), Clare (40.8), Strathalbyn (43.1C), Hindmarsh Island (40.7C), Murray Bridge (44C) and Stenhouse Bay (40.1C).</p>
      <p>In Adelaide, the mercury peaked at 42.2C at the Bureau of Meteorology's Kent Town observatory and 41.6C at its official West Terrace headquarters.</p>
      <p>Both were just shy of the record 42.7C recorded at Kent Town in 1962.</p>
      <p>The hottest spot across the Adelaide suburbs was Edinburgh with 44.5C.</p>
      <p>The heat was not expected to last with the weather bureau forecasting a cool change to sweep across the state by early on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Temperatures were expected to drop back to the low 20s with Adelaide's maximum tipped to fall by half to just 21C.</p>
      <p>That change also prompted the bureau to also put a severe weather warning in place for potentially damaging winds across a wide area including most of York and Eyre Peninsulas and the Adelaide Hills.</p>
      <p>It said wind gusts of up to 90km/h were possible as the front moved through.</p>
      <p>The unusually hot conditions on Wednesday prompted authorities to close more than 100 schools along with most national parks and reserves.</p>
      <p>On the lower Eyre Peninsula, SA Power Networks also decided to cut power to more than 10,000 properties as a safety precaution.</p>
      <p>By late afternoon, most of those properties remained offline with the company warning of the prospect of extended outages.</p>
      <p>In Port Lincoln, the local council opened an arts centre to provide a refuge from the heat and also urged people to seek out commercial venues with generators such as hotels or restaurants.</p>
      <p>The heat and high winds also prompted a warning from health authorities about raised dust and other issues.</p>
      <p>Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said people with pre-existing chest or heart conditions should stay indoors, avoid exposure to the conditions and to follow their personal management plans.</p>
