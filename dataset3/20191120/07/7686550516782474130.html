      <p>Wayne Pivac has had talks with Liam Williams about returning to Wales full-time from English crisis club Saracens.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old full-back’s contract with the Heineken Champions Cup and controversial Gallagher Premiership winners is up at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Saracens are facing a battle to avoid relegation from the Premiership after being docked 35 points and fined over £5m for breaches of the competition’s salary cap regulations.</p>
      <p>And last month, WalesOnline exclusively revealed Williams <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/liam-williams-wales-rugby-saracens-17157777">could now be coming home.</a></p>
      <p>Williams has reportedly visited his former region Scarlets, while his signature is also being pursued by former European club champions Toulon, Ospreys and others.</p>
      <p>Pivac revealed: “I met with Liam pre the World Cup and there have been discussions.</p>
      <p>“Liam will make his decision no doubt very shortly and it’s one that, from a selfish Welsh point of view, I’d love to see him back here in Wales.</p>
      <p>“That’s a decision ultimately he will make given that he can play both inside and outside the country, given the number of Test matches he’s played.”</p>

      <p>The Kiwi disclosed Alun Wyn Jones, who misses Pivac’s debut Wales match as coach against the Barbarians through a groin injury, will remain captain.</p>
      <p>“At the moment the leadership of Alun Wyn is very important to us. I’ve had several conversations with Alun Wyn pre and post World Cup and he’s a big part of our plans going forward at this stage, hence why he was re-contracted,” he said.</p>
      <p>Pivac revealed he telephoned centre Scott Williams to explain his omission from the squad and the inclusion of Welsh-qualified New Zealander Willis Halaholo for the uncapped clash with the Barbarians.</p>
      <p>“As I mentioned to Scott I know a lot about him. I coached him for four years and he’s been a very, very good player for me in the past.</p>
      <p>“We’ve won a championship together. He’s played some fantastic rugby. Willis we don’t know as much about in the northern hemisphere.</p>
      <p>“From what I’ve seen in the games he’s played against the Scarlets sides I’ve coached he can beat a guy in a phone box.</p>
      <p>“He’s got a skill-set not many people have, but we want to see the other side of his game up close and personal in our camp.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a Test cap game, so it’s a great opportunity to get some questions answered hence some of the selections.</p>
      <p>“We’ve done them with a view of let’s learn as much as we can about the players that will be available for the Six Nations.”</p>
