      <h2>Joshua dropped Ruiz Jr in the fourth round but was then knocked down four times and stopped in New York</h2>

      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr has claimed it was Anthony Joshua who threw a lucky punch in their first meeting.</p>
      <p>The chubby heavyweight stunned the boxing world by knocking Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>Ruiz relieved the Brit of his three world titles with Joshua claiming he did so with a "lucky punch sent from the Gods".</p>
      <p>But as the rivals prepare to clash again next month, the champion has hit back, claiming he wasn't hurt when he was dropped in the third round.</p>
      <p>"That was a lucky shot for him, too," Ruiz Jr told Sky Sports. “I got lazy. It was a punch in the blink of an eye. I thought: 'What just happened?'</p>

      <p>"I wasn't that hurt because I wasn't wobbling. I still had the will and the fire inside of me. I wanted to keep fighting and win the fight.</p>
      <p>“Once he dropped me, then got me with a really good right hand, I could eat his punches. Mentally he thought, 'This guy isn't going down, what is happening?.</p>
      <p>"I had to do everything possible to change the fight, and that’s what I did with the left hook.</p>
      <p>"The left hook was a really great shot in the temple. The other times I hit him in the head, he loosened up and got wobbly. I was the better fighter that day because I pressured him, threw more punches and the body shots put him down."</p>

      <p>Ruiz stepped in at six weeks' notice to face Joshua after Jarrell Miller failed three drug tests.</p>
      <p>And the new champion believes the Brit would have beaten anyone else on that famous night in New York.</p>
      <p>"If it was another fighter in there, Joshua would have beat him," he said. "If it was Jarrell Miller, he would have beaten him.</p>
      <p>"I was hungry, that's the difference between me and other fighters. I've been doing it since I was six years old, it's all I know."</p>
