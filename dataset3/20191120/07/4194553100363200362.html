      <h1>(Video) Gini Wijnaldum’s stunning Netherlands hat-trick as skipper proves he’s one of world’s best midfielders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:26:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Gini Wijnaldum put in a breathtaking performance last night v Estonia with the Netherlands already qualified.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s controlling, tactical midfielder – who Jurgen Klopp relies on implicitly – is given far more freedom by Ronald Koeman on international duty and he takes advantage of it to boot.</p>
      <p>Gini’s hat-trick in the 5-0 win made it eight goals in qualifying for Euro 2020 – making him the highest scoring midfielder in the continent!</p>
      <p>This term, he’s notched just once for Liverpool, but should Klopp ever feel the need to deploy him further forward – we reckon Wijnaldum will be delighted.</p>
