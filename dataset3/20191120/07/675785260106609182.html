      <p>A mum was left furious after an Aldi customer accused her of faking her agonising spinal disability.</p>
      <p>Laura Davies, 27, suffers from degenerative disc disease - when one more of the discs between the vertebrae of the spinal column deteriorates or breaks down.</p>
      <p>When the mother-of-one  parked in a disabled bay at Aldi, she said she heard a man muttering under his breath while staring at her.</p>
      <p>Laura said: "I politely asked him ‘is there something I can help you with?’.</p>
      <p>"His response ‘well yes actually, why are you parking there, you’re too young to be disabled and look OK to me’.</p>
      <p>"I was furious but kindly responded, ‘not all disabilities are always visible’, I then walked into the store.</p>

      <p>Laura, who lives in Mackworth, Derbyshire, said she was limping that day but the man had just seen her stood still by her car.</p>
      <p>"It was horrendous," she said, "It was not pleasant at all. I'm headstrong, I've been through a lot in my life but it scared me.</p>
      <p>"I was angry and upset. I’m a tough cookie but I actually just wanted to burst into tears."</p>

      <p>Laura, who has worked at Rolls-Royce for six years on behalf of Lionbridge UK, said it can be a "horrendous" condition, reports <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/aldi-blue-badge-derby-3552970">Derbyshire Live.</a></p>
      <p>She said: "I don't think people understand the mental side of it. During a bad episode I physically can't do anything, it's difficult.</p>
      <p>"Even on a good day I'm in agony."</p>
      <p>Laura wants to raise awareness of less visible disabilities and conditions. She added: “I couldn’t sleep last night, I thought I need to air this.</p>

      <p>"My partner said to me I should just do it because sharing my story could help others, which is what I want to do.</p>
      <p>"People need educating. I hope this gets back to the man, not in an angry way but to let him see how his actions might affect someone who is maybe less headstrong.</p>
      <p>"People need to be more mindful and less judgemental."</p>
