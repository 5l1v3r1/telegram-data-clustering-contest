      <h1>Facebook’s experimental ‘Whale’ app lets you create forced memes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:53:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:53</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>Facebook’s really fishing for the next big thing, and it hopes that its new meme-creation app called Whale is the catch it’s looking for.</p>
      <p>Spotted on the Canadian iOS App Store by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/12ecc6">The Information</a>, Whale lets users create their own memes combining emoji, filters and text to uploaded or stock images.</p>
      <p>“No distractions, no hidden subscription pricing. Use your own images or choose from our stock photo library and get creative with text, tools, effects, and more right inside the app,” reads the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">app’s description</a>.</p>
      <p>There’s also a free-draw tool for those who want to draw some classic memes, and users can share or save their creations to contacts or their devices.</p>
      <p>Whale comes from Facebook’s New Produce Experimentation team, a division that also includes <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/aux-live-school-radio/id1474289547">a group listening app</a> and an app that makes <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/bump-make-new-friends/id1474661920">meeting people a little less awkward</a>.</p>
      <p>However, neither have really been much of a hit, and neither have really been released to a global audience. That’s not to say Whale will be made widely available, either.</p>
      <p>Facebook hasn’t pushed much info regarding Whale’s existence or future, but the company does have room to experiment. <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/10/facebook-apps-users-2019/">In late October</a>, Facebook’s “family of apps” had 2.2-billion daily active users.</p>
