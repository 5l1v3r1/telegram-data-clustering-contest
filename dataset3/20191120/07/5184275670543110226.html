      <p><i>Stree</i> starring Rajkummar Rao and Shraddha Kapoor in lead was a blockbuster at the box office. While the performances of both the leads along with the supporting cast, was hailed by the critics, the makers were given a heads up too for their work too! Now, owing to the success, the team is reuniting all over again but not for <i>Stree 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Yes, you heard it right. Producer Dinesh Vijan is now working on a project and has brought back his favourite pair Rajkummar &amp; Shraddha to play the leads. But this time, the film will be helmed by Gujrati director Abhishek Jain. While the other info regarding the movie still remains under wraps, it’s good that we at least have confirmation regarding the leads, unlike many recent biggies that are still in works.</p>

      <p>A source close to Deccan Chronicle reveals the same as, “Abhishek (Jain) has worked with Subhash Ghai as well as Sanjay Leela Bhansali, and understands the big cinema universe as well. For Vijan, he was an appropriate choice to direct Shraddha and Rajkummar.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, director Amar Kaushik recently in an exclusive conversation with Koimoi revealed details regarding the sequel of <i>Stree</i>.</p>
      <p>“<i>Stree 2</i> will happen, It is the first time that wherever I am heading to everyone has the same question. Expectations are so high that we will have to work harder. It cannot be just a part two for the sake of it. I will make sure that script is crisper, the story a level up. If things fall into place, the sequel is bound to happen, this year or next year can’t tell you the date but whenever it does it will be an amazing product and I guarantee you that. It will be a treat for the audience,” he shared.</p>
