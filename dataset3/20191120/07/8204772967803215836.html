      <p>Rugby Australia chief executive Raelene Castle said: “This is a massive coup for Australian rugby, Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we’re thrilled to havesecured his services.</p>
      <p>“Dave’s coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. He has a proven track record in the Northernand Southern Hemisphere.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Rugby chief Executive Mark Dodson said: “I’d like to thank Dave for the contribution he’s made to the development of Glasgow Warriors over the past two seasons.</p>
      <p>“He’s led a talented playing and coaching group with passion and encouraged the team to express themselves and play positive rugby throughout.</p>
      <p>“He enhanced the strong, positive culture at Scotstoun and pushed the team to achieve significant results, playing some outstanding rugby on the way.</p>
      <p>“He has conducted himself throughout with great professionalism and I know he will want to sign off his time in Glasgow with some silverware. We wish him well for the future.”</p>
      <p>Rennie told glasgowwarriors.org: “We’ve loved our time here around great people. It’s been as good as I could have wished for after leaving New Zealand.</p>
      <p>“It’s an exciting opportunity to coach at international level and an added bonus that we’ll be a little closer to home, near our kids and grandkids.</p>
      <p>“All my focus is on the rest of the season in Glasgow as we strive to be in the mix come play-off time in both comps again.”</p>
