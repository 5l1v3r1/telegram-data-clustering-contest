      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Microsoft says that its own workplace collaboration service Teams now has more than 20 million daily active users.</p>
      <p>That's 8 million more than what upstart work messaging service Slack boasted of having last month. Microsoft is in a fierce popularity contest with Slack.</p>
      <p>Slack, which had its initial public offering in June, was in a federally-mandated quiet period when Microsoft first revealed its Teams metrics in early July.</p>
      <p>Slack has since gotten louder about downplaying the numbers, saying users are more engaged with its customizable service than "legacy suites of badly connected products" — a thinly veiled swipe at Microsoft.</p>
      <p>Microsoft benefits from being able to bundle Teams as part of a software package that includes email and other products.</p>
      <p>Slack's shares took a hit after Microsoft's announcement Tuesday.</p>
