      <p>Shares of the Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries (RIL) gained about 4% on Wednesday to touch its 52-week high of ₹1,571.85 in a firm Mumbai market on November 20.</p>
      <p>RIL shares were trading up 3.5% at ₹1,562 in a firm Mumbai market on November 20, valuing the company at ₹9,90,197 crore, less than ₹10,000 crore away to touch the market capitalisation of ₹10 lakh crore.</p>
      <p>RIL market capitalisation has already overtaken the market capitalisation of BP Plc. to enter the club of six elite global oil majors led by ExxonMobil with market capitalisation of about $290 billion.</p>
      <p>Saudi Aramco's listing is expected to make it the most valued oil firm market capitalisation of about $1.7 trillion.</p>
      <p>The surge in RIL's share made billionaire Mukesh Ambani, the richest Asian, overtaking Jack Ma of Alibaba Group, according to Bloomberg's billionaires index.</p>
      <p>Surge in RIL's shares is also narrowing the gap with PetroChina Co., currently Asia’s biggest oil company by market capitalisation.</p>
