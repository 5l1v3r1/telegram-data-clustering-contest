      <p>Pope Francis landed just after noon at Don Mueang International Airport as people lined up along his route into town to welcome the 82-year-old pontiff. </p>
      <p>The pope was seen waving from a lowered car window to greet the public while he was on his way to the Apostolic Nunciature Embassy of the Holy See on Sathorn Road. </p>
      <p>More than 6,500 police officers have been deployed across the capital to ensure security.</p>
      <p>It’s the first time a pope has visited the kingdom in 23 years, during which he will meet the king, prime minister, top Buddhist monk and hold two masses.</p>
