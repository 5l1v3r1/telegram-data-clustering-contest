      <h1>Netherlands replaces "tulip Holland" identity with "less touristy" NL logo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:00:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/alyn-griffiths/" target="_blank">Alyn Griffiths</a></address>
      <p>Dutch <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/branding">branding</a> agency <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/studio-dumbar">Studio Dumbar</a> has designed a new visual identity for the <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/netherlands">Netherlands</a> featuring a <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/logos">logo</a> that combines the letters NL with a stylised tulip.</p>
      <p>The Dutch government asked the <a href="https://studiodumbar.com/">Rotterdam-based studio</a> to develop a new identity that will be used to help enhance the nation's image on the global stage.</p>

      <p>The project was initiated because the government agencies responsible for promoting the Netherlands around the world wanted to move away from the previous visual identity, which featured a tulip and the word Holland in a hand-painted style.</p>
      <p>The use of Holland in this context was seen by many as inappropriate as it refers to a particular region rather than the whole country. The new identity instead includes a word mark for the Netherlands alongside the NL acronym.</p>

      <p>"Dutch people have a direct recognition and an emotional connection with NL; it stands for our country," said Tom Dorresteijn, strategy director at Studio Dumbar.</p>
      <p>"Many people abroad know it, especially in Europe. And for those who don't, it is simply an abstract brand-symbol."</p>

      <p>The two letters forming the NL symbol are expressed in a bold, sans serif <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/fonts">font</a>, and are subtly adapted so the adjacent stems create the shape of an abstracted tulip.</p>
      <p>The tulip is commonly used as a symbol for the country, along with the colour <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/orange">orange</a>, which is also retained and applied across the new visual identity.</p>

      <p>Dorresteijn told Dezeen that the reference to the tulip is intentionally subtle, as the logo needs to be suitable for use by a wide range of stakeholders, including <a href="http://dezeen.com/tag/universities">universities</a>, embassies and cultural organisations in the Netherlands and around the world.</p>
      <p>"A traditional tulip symbol is too much connected to tourism and souvenirs," the designer explained. "We designed it in such a way that it is more a reference to a tulip. It makes the acronym more interesting and intriguing, because it is more than a straightforward NL."</p>

      <p>The Dutch government's minister for foreign trade and development cooperation, Sigrid Kaag, also claimed that the design's simplicity will enable it to be used successfully in different contexts.</p>
      <p>"The new logo can be applied across a range of fields," she pointed out, "from high-tech to agri-food and from sport to culture. A clear-cut international image is positive for our exports and the attraction of investment and talent."</p>

      <p>In most scenarios, the NL logo will be accompanied by the Netherlands word mark. Both elements form part of a wider visual-identity system based on a simple grid that is designed to be accessible and easy to use.</p>
      <p>The Dutch central government will begin using the NL Brand visual-identity from 1 January 2020, and any partners wishing to apply it in their marketing materials can already download the assets and guidelines from <a href="https://www.hollandtoolkit.com/">a dedicated website</a>.</p>
      <p>The Dutch women's football team also recently <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/07/13/royal-dutch-football-association-replaces-lion-crest-with-lioness-national-womens-team/">updated its visual identity</a> to replace the replace the Royal Dutch Football Association's lion crest with a lioness.</p>
