      <h1>Khamenei says enemy 'repelled' in protest-hit Iran</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:00:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the enemy had been "repelled" in the country where dozens are thought to have died in violent protests sparked by a petrol price hike.</p>
      <p>Demonstrations broke out in the sanctions-hit Islamic republic on Friday after it was announced the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200 percent.</p>
      <p>"We have pushed back the enemy in the military arena. We have pushed back the enemy in the political war," Khamenei said in a speech aired on state television late Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"We have repelled the enemy in the arena of security warfare... in recent days," he said, adding that the unrest had not been the result of a popular movement.</p>
      <p>"The recent actions were security issues, not from the people," he said. "We have repelled the enemy."</p>
      <p>State television, which rarely shows any signs of dissent in Iran, has aired footage of masked young men appearing to clash with security forces.</p>
      <p>The United Nations called for restraint on Tuesday and voiced alarm at reports dozens may have been killed in the violence.</p>
      <p>London-based rights group Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed across Iran since security forces were ordered to "crush" the protests.</p>
      <p>Iran's economy has been battered since May last year when the United States unilaterally withdrew from a 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed crippling sanctions.</p>
