      <p>The leaders and business experts will meet to address challenges affecting business across the East African region.</p>
      <p>The East African Community has in the recent past been grappling with weak relations between countries where many are unclear with their economic future with the growing debt affecting the majority of the countries.</p>
      <p>who doubles up as the Vice-Chair of the East Africa Business council says the two-day event will help the region’s top executives to come up with solutions that will boost trade in the region.</p>
      <p>“The summit will bring together industry champions, investors all to combine their efforts on how they can work together and come up with plans and future prospects for the region,” said Nesbit.</p>
      <p>Other top agendas during the summit will also allow the leaders to give execution on some of the solutions that were issued during the Africa Continental Free Trade Area entry into force in October.</p>
      <p>“Top on the agenda will also be the implementation of directs of the summit on the One Regional Airspace, finalizing the review of the Trade Remedies Committee, Ratification, finalizing on the common external summit among others,” he added.</p>
      <p>There will also be a CEOs Round Table with the EAC Council of Ministers and parallel exhibitions to showcase new products and services as well as the latest technologies and innovations.</p>
      <p>The leaders will also address rotational hosting within the bloc that will allow all countries to have the opportunity to host the summit.</p>
      <p>They will also review a report on the integration of a fragile South Sudan and consider progress on the verification exercise for the admission of Somalia into the bloc and to solidify their support for Kenya’s pursuit for a non-permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council.</p>
