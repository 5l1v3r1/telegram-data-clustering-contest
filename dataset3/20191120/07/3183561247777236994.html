      <h3>Black Widow</h3>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/florence-pugh-black-widow-scarlett-johansson-1203407589/">Variety</a>, Florence Pugh described <i>Black Widow</i> as “something very raw and very painful and very beautiful.”</p>
      <blockquote>I think we’ve made something very raw and very painful and very beautiful and I think people are going to be really surprised by the outcome of a big action film having that much heart. And I know lots of people will be emotional about her because her character had such a hard ending [in “Infinity War”], but it was special learning from her, and she’s been doing this for like 10 years in those films. For this to be <i>her</i> film was special. And I got to be there and see how she does stunts and lives it, and it’s so her.</blockquote>

      <h3>The Flash</h3>
      <p>Director Danielle Panabaker hyped Grant Gustin’s comedic performance in tonight’s episode of <i>The Flash</i>, “Licence to Elongate.”</p>
      <blockquote>Grant’s so incredibly talented and, particularly this season as they’re preparing for Crisis, we haven’t gotten to see a ton of levity from him. And so to really give him the opportunity... to really lean into the comedy there was, I think, fun for him. There were some stunts that I had not intended for him to do and he got on stage and he was like, ‘Well, can I do that?’ And I was like, ‘That’s not up to me!’ So you know, I think he was really enjoying himself.</blockquote>
