      <p>A woman in Australia removed her shirt and rushed in the smoldering brush to rescue a koala bear caught near the flames amid the recent spate of fires.</p>
      <p>The brave rescuer, who identified herself as Toni, was seen on video disrobing before charging toward the flames and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/koala-rescue-woman-risks-her-life-fire-in-australia-2019-11-19/">taking the koala into her arms</a>, according to CBS News.</p>
      <p>She then poured water on the smoldering animal before taking it to a sanctuary.</p>
      <p>The koala is reportedly in good condition.</p>
      <p>Bushfires have ravaged around 2.5 million acres of farmland and bush across Australia’s east coast in recent weeks, killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes.</p>
      <p>The country’s koala populations have also been a major victim of the flames, with more than 350 of the marsupials feared killed in a major habitat.</p>
