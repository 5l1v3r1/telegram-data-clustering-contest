        <b>- Two Kaduna state lawmakers have been sacked by the appeal court</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- The lawmakers are members of the opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP)</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>- A rerun will be conducted in parts of the two state constituencies affected by the ruling</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Court of Appeal sitting in Kaduna on Tuesday, November 19 sacked two Kaduna state House of Assembly members.</p>
      <p>The appellate court ordered that a rerun be conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to determine who will represent Kagarko and Sanga constituencies in the state assembly.</p>
      <p>In Kagarko, the appellate court ordered for a rerun in 22 polling units located in two wards of the constituency.</p>
      <p>In the judgement read by Justice Daniel Kaliop, the appellate court affirmed the earlier ruling of the state assembly election tribunal in respect of Kagarko constituency.</p>
      <p>Nuhu Shadalafiya of the All Progressives Congress (APC) had challenged the victory of Morondia Tanko of the PDP at the tribunal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The tribunal had ordered for fresh election in the 22 polling units, but the PDP candidate went to the appeal court, asking it to set aside the tribunal’s judgement and affirm his election as declared by INEC.</p>
      <p>The appeal court dismissed the case for lacking in merit and ordered INEC to conduct a fresh election in the 22 polling units.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the appeal court ordered for rerun in Sanga constituency after it upturned the earlier ruling of the tribunal, which affirmed the election of Comfort Amwe of the PDP.</p>
      <p>Gambo Danga of APC had challenged the tribunal’s decision at the appeal court.</p>
