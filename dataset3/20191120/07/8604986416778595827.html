      <p>As much as we all try to <a href="https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/8-powerful-apps-that-end-email-agony-and-win-back-hours-of-your-time.html">streamline</a> and <a href="https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/i-tried-these-5-simple-gmail-hacks-it-slashed-time-i-spend-on-email.html">limit our time</a> on email, we still need it (at least for now!) to keep our brands humming. In fact, its the backbone of communication for a lot of <a href="https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/these-4-girl-bosses-are-investing-millions-in-female-entrepreneurs-heres-how-to-get-funded.html">businesses</a> -- it's often our first line of communication with everyone we speak with everyone from <a href="https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/marriott-just-tripled-revenue-earned-through-its-content-site-traveler-heres-how-theyre-inspiring-customers-and-making-a-profit.html">customers</a> to <a href="https://www.inc.com/amanda-pressner-kreuser/10-of-the-most-annoying-coworking-behaviors-ever-witnessed.html">coworkers</a>. </p>
      <p>It's pretty essential to nail messaging the first time, not just because a short and well-crafted email gets a better response rate, but because your email style can have a direct impact on client retention and future sales.</p>
      <p>Unless you're a professional writer (or work with a <a href="http://mastheadmedia.com/">content marketing company</a> that can help) you may not even realize how your emails are being perceived, or if they're (gasp!) putting people off. </p>
      <p>Luckily, artificial intelligence only continues to advance and your emails are going to get better because of it. Here are 2 AI-driven tools to help you start sending better emails ASAP.</p>
      <h3>1. <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/tone">Grammarly's Tone Detector </a></h3>
      <p>
        <i>Available on Gmail and Yahoo </i>
      </p>
      <p>Have you ever written an email and thought to yourself, "Do I sound too formal?" or "Am I coming off too eager?" </p>
      <p>Well, with Grammarly's tone detector, you no longer have to question if you're setting the right tone with your emails. The detector uses a combination of rules and machine learning to find signals in a piece of writing that lead to its tone. It considers everything from word choice, phrasing, punctuation, and capitalization. </p>
      <p>The tone detector will ensure your writing conveys the tone you're hoping to achieve with a certain audience (so no surprises for when they reply).</p>
      <p>You'll feel better than ever sending off your emails -- and could even create even better bonds with your customers and coworkers. </p>
      <h3>2. <a href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/insights/">Boomerang Insights</a> </h3>
      <p>
        <i>Available on Gmail </i>
      </p>
      <p>If you ever wanted to improve your email experience, Boomerang Insights is here to tell you exactly how to do it. This newly released program takes a deep dive into your inbox to determine the tone you use, the reading level of your writing, how often you check your email, your email storage tendencies and more. </p>
      <p>After analyzing your emails, Boomerang Insights presents a chart to help you determine the best time to send emails based on your tone and the time of day. (And that means you <i>personally</i>, not the emailing community at large).</p>
      <p>For example, maybe some of your emails dashed off after 10:00 PM were less polite ('cause you understandably get cranks past your bedtime) whereas your emails around 11:00 AM (fully caffeinated!) reflected a more energetic tone. From this information, you can determine it's better for you to send emails during the morning time. </p>
      <p>Put these two programs into play, and you'll have a better understanding of how to be more productive when it comes to email--and get a better response. </p>
