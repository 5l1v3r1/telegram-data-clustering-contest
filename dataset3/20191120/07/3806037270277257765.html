      <h1>Kaytranada Says Second Album Is Finished, Teases New Tracks</h1>
      <h2>The followup to ‘99.9%’ is almost here.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:45:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p>Kaytranada is done with his second album. In a tweet Monday, the fervent Montréal producer shared “album. finito,” noting that the followup to his critically-acclaimed full-length debut, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2016/5/kaytranada-99-9-album-stream"><i>99.9%</i></a>, is officially done. The news follows a year of sporadic cuts the artist has put out, including April’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/4/kaytranada-dysfunctional-vanjess-stream">“DYSFUNCTIONAL”</a> single alongside <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/vanjess">VanJess</a> Following the release, he spoke to Zane Lowe, further teasing the project. “It’s gonna be worth the wait. You’re gonna see an evolution of Kaytranada,” he shared.</p>
      <p>On top of noting the album’s completion, just yesterday the super-producer took to Instagram to tease what he’s calling an “IG BEATAPE,” teasing a variety of instrumentals that acknowledge his unforgettable sound. While most are instrumental cuts, Kaytanada is surely evolving — there are refined hints of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/j-dilla">J Dilla</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/madlib">Madlib</a> scattered across the teasers.</p>
