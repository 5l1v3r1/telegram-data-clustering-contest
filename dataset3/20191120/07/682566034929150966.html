      <p>Johannesburg - <b>Egypt</b> and the <b>Ivory Coast</b> secured places on Tuesday at the <b>2020 Tokyo Olympic Games</b> football tournament after contrasting qualifying tournament semi-finals victories in <b>Cairo</b>.</p>
      <p>Abdel Rahman Magdy scored two late goals to complete a 3-0 triumph for Egypt over South Africa after captain Ramadan Sobhy had broken the deadlock by converting a 59th-minute penalty.</p>
      <p>The referee controversially pointed to the penalty spot despite the South African defender being clearly outside of the box which gave Egypt an undeserved lead.</p>
      <p>Egyptian footballers last appeared at the Olympics seven years ago in London, where they fell to Japan in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>The victory over South Africa maintained a perfect record by the host nation in the qualifying tournament after one-goal group victories over Mali, Ghana and Cameroon.</p>
      <p>Ivory Coast edged Ghana 3-2 in a penalty shootout following a 2-2 draw after extra time to secure a second qualification for the Olympics, having reached the 2008 quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Youssouf Dao twice put the Ivorians ahead in regulation time and the second Ghana equaliser came from Evans Mensah in the second minute of stoppage time.</p>
      <p>Ghana had several chances to win the match in extra time while Czech Republic-based Dao fluffed a last-minute opportunity to complete his hat-trick.</p>
      <p>The shootout was won by the Ivorians when a weak fifth Ghanaian spot-kick from Owusu Kwabena was saved by Eliezer Tape Ira.</p>
      <p>Africa has been allocated three places at the Tokyo Games and the third slot will go to the winners of a play-off between Ghana and South Africa this Friday.</p>
      <p>There have been five Olympics football medallists from Africa with Nigeria winning gold, silver and bronze, Cameroon gold and Ghana bronze.</p>
