      <p>The New England Patriots tight end said during an interview with <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/28114359/rob-gronkowski-say-never-return-not-2019">ESPN</a>, “I wouldn’t say ‘Never coming back.’</p>
      <p>“I’m 30 years old. I’m young. I still stay fit, still watch the game whenever I can, still enjoy it. I’m feeling good, but you know, one year off could possibly be the case. Or maybe two years off, man.”</p>
