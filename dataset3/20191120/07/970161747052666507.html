      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) was released from prison in Emmerdale tonight <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">and she was sporting a pregnancy</a> – leading to speculation that she could be carrying the baby of either David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) or <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (Joe Warren Plant).</p>
      <p>However, despite this major bombshell, it seems like it’s up in the air whether Emmerdale will revisit the storyline. An Emmerdale spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: ‘There are no current plans for Maya to return.’</p>
      <p>It seems like one of those storyline seeds that has been planted for a potential future storyline – but, as for now, it seems to be being rested. The paternity of the baby has not been confirmed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-fans-shocked-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184419/">Viewers have been shocked to learn that Maya is carrying a baby</a> and Jacob is still desperately in love with the woman who groomed him. Having emerged from prison and knowing further contact could land her back in a cell, Maya deleted Jacob’s number. But that’s not to say that she won’t ever return.</p>

      <p>David managed to persuade Jacob off of the bus to go and meet with Maya but even thought Jacob returned home, he made it clear that he was not ready to give up on Maya. Sending her texts and voicemails, he has pinned his hopes on a reunion so it’s clear that the impact of Maya’s grooming still haunt him.</p>

      <p>He is in a relationship with Leanna and this will develop over coming weeks as they end up sleeping together – leading to Liam lashing out and making accusations against Jacob.</p>
      <p>But is he truly over Maya? And will she ever be back to introduce a baby to either David or Jacob? It seems safe to assume that Emmerdale haven’t just planted this bombshell for no apparent consequence.</p>
      <p>But for now, Louisa is not filming with the show.</p>
