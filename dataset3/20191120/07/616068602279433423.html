      <p>Ariana Grande treated a group of fans to lunch in Lexington, Kentucky on Sunday to apologize for having to cancel her concert in the city.<br/><br/>A bad sinus infection forced the pop superstar to scrap her performance at the Rupp Arena on Sunday night, hours after she had warned ticketholders she may not be able to press on with the gig as she was finding it difficult to breathe.<br/><br/>A number of devotees, who had traveled to Lexington for the tour date, decided to show their support for Grande by heading to the venue anyway, where they met up with fellow fans for a social gathering.<br/><br/>The get-together was organized by Shellye Echeverria, one of the administrators behind the @GrandeTourNews Twitter account, and when the 7 Rings hitmaker heard about their plans, she reached out to see if there was anything she could do to help.<br/><br/>According to the Lexington Herald Leader, Grande subsequently had an assistant contact Echeverria to organize a special lunch date for the group at the nearby Saul Good Restaurant &amp; Pub, where she picked up the bill.</p>
