        <b>Friday Olokor &amp; Gbenga Odogun</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Women Leader of Wada Aro Campaign Council, Ochadamu ward, Mrs. Acheju Abuh, was on Monday burnt alive in her home by suspected thugs.</p>
      <p>She was also the Women Leader for the campaign organisation of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Musa Wada, in the just-concluded governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the thugs arrived at Abuh’s home around 2pm and blocked every exit from the house.</p>
      <p>They were said to have then sprayed the building with petrol, set it ablaze and fired continuously, as terrified villagers watched from afar.</p>
      <p>A source said, “The blood-thirsty thugs waited, shooting and watching with relish while Mrs. Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out.</p>
      <p>“They left when the entire house had been burnt to ashes, with Abuh in it.”</p>
      <p>The Kogi State Police Command confirmed the incident through its Public Relations Officer, William Aya.</p>
      <p>Aya, in a statement, said there was a misunderstanding between one Awolu Zekeri, a member of the All Progressives Congress; and one Gowon Simeon, a member of the PDP, both of Ochadamu ward.</p>
      <p>He said, “Gowon Simeon stabbed Zekeri with a knife and he died on his way to hospital.</p>
      <p>“As a result, angry youths in the area mobilised to the house of one Simeon Abuh of same address, who is an uncle to the suspect, set it ablaze (and) thereby burnt one Salome Abuh, aged 60 years. Three other houses were also burnt.</p>
      <p>“The corpse has been moved to the University Teaching Hospital Mortuary Anyigba for autopsy.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Transition Monitoring Group on Tuesday expressed concern over the killing of Abuh, saying it should be investigated.</p>
      <p>The chairperson of the TMG, Dr. Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, in a statement, said, “We call on the Inspector General of Police to conduct an immediate investigation into the death of Salome Abuh, while all steps should be taken to bring to book the perpetrators of this dastardly act.”</p>
