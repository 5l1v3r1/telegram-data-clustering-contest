      <h2>Latest West Bromwich Albion news | The Baggies are on course to secure promotion to the Premier League, here's a behind-the-scenes look at how they're aiming to do it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:55:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion are enjoying a good start to the season in the Sky Bet Championship.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">Baggies</a> are currently top of the league table as we approach the end of the November international break.</p>
      <p>Slaven Bilic’s side will be hoping that they can maintain their bright start to the campaign and secure promotion to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>One member of staff at The Hawthorns who will be vital to Albion mounting a promotion push is first-team fitness coach Nick Davies.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Davies, who joined Albion’s coaching staff in 2018, is responsible for making sure the players are available for selection game in, game out.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old recently spoke about how he keeps the Albion players in check, and has revealed the process behind making sure Bilic has as many players fit and ready to play.</p>
      <p>“All the players have got an app on their phone,” Davies told the Express &amp; Star.</p>
      <p>He added: “They enter information on how well they have slept, if they feel any fatigue and if they have any soreness.</p>
      <p>“What we are trying to do, before they have walked into the building, is build up a picture to see if anyone has any problems. It’s real time information for us.</p>

      <p>“If a player is struggling to sleep for example, we will sit down with them and work out why. Maybe we can help with nutrition or simple guidelines like bed time routines.</p>
      <p>“If someone says they have got some muscle tightness, it doesn’t mean they aren’t going to train but it does mean they will have extra interventions before training. Maybe a massage or a specialised stretching routine.</p>
      <p>“All these things are to ensure they can train rather than give them reasons not to train – that has always been my philosophy.</p>
      <p>“We want to build robust players that can withstand the rigours of Championship football. You don’t get that by wrapping people up in cotton wool.”</p>
