      <p>But, despite the time of superstars dominated by Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the World Cup winner is happy with his own legacy.</p>
      <p>Villa told the PA news agency: "You can have success or not, you can have more trophies or less trophies but the most important thing is giving everything to the club.</p>
      <p>"I want people to remember me like that, a humble player, who always gave everything on and off the field, a man who tried to help all the clubs he played for and gave 100 per cent to the sport.</p>
      <p>"I feel always the love of the people, journalists and world soccer. I don't compare myself with other players.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy with the love everyone gives me. I'm not more happy or less happy because people love other players more than me.</p>
      <p>"I made the decision to retire after thinking about it a lot, talking with the people around me, who know me very well. It's not an easy decision but it is the right decision, right now.</p>
      <p>"I'm feeling good, I'm going to give everything to Vissel Kobe in the next month and a half and then I'm ready for the next step in my life and career."</p>

      <p>Villa went from Valencia to Barcelona and Atletico Madrid before spending four seasons with New York City FC, scoring 80 goals in 124 MLS games.</p>
      <p>He won LaLiga with Barca, twice, and once with Atletico while also scoring in Barca's 3-1 defeat to Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Villa netted 59 times in 98 appearances for Spain, winning the World Cup in 2010 and Euro 2008 – where he top scored with four goals.</p>
      <p>Spain's class of 2019 reached next year's European Championship after a 1-1 draw with Sweden in October.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/luis-enrique/"><b>Luis Enrique</b></a> is returning as manager, five months after stepping down from the role for personal reasons.</p>
      <p>Enrique resigned in June as his nine-year-old daughter Xana was seriously ill with bone cancer and subsequently died in August, with Robert Moreno taking charge.</p>
      <p>It is their first tournament since last year's World Cup disaster when Julen Lopetegui was sacked two days before their first game after being announced as Real Madrid manager.</p>
      <p>Spain, under temporary boss Fernando Hierro, lost on penalties to hosts Russia in the last 16 and Villa believes lessons have been learned by his country.</p>
      <p>"It was a bad situation for our federation, our team, everything, I can't say a lot as I wasn't there but obviously the team wasn't ready in the last World Cup," said Villa, speaking at the launch of the Booking.com Stadium Suite at Wembley.</p>

      <p>"I believe this has changed, we're ready and in the next tournament we can do a good job.</p>
      <p>"They have a great team but England are also one of the favourites, France, Germany, Holland. You never know though because the Euros has had surprises, Denmark years ago and Greece.</p>
      <p>"These teams have the most possibilities to win."</p>
      <p>From January Villa will focus on leading the development of a new team in the New York borough of Queens.</p>
      <p>Queensboro FC has been awarded a franchise in the USL Championship, the second tier of US football, from 2021.</p>
      <p>But, unlike former Barca team-mate Xavi who is coaching Al-Sadd in Qatar, Villa does not see himself as a manager.</p>
      <p>"I'm focused on Queensboro, not as a coach though," he added. "I don't look at myself as a coach. In the future I don't know but for now I'm focusing on other things."</p>
