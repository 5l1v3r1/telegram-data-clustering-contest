        <b>Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley) was left devastated in Emmerdale when he discovered that wife Moira (Natalie J Robb) had been having a steamy affair with farmhand Nate Robinson (Jurrell Carter) — and matters were made worse when he discovered that Nate was actually his son. Moira’s attempted to make amends, but Cain’s having none of it and, in the coming episodes, he makes his wife suffer all the more.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After Faith (Sally Dexter) began meddling in Moira’s affairs — quite literally, in this instance — she discovered that her daughter-in-law had been sleeping with someone. Although she believed it to be Pete (Anthony Quinlan), Cain discovered that Nate was the other bloke, and thus he set about getting revenge on both Nate and Moira.</p>
      <p>During his revenge plan — which quickly spiralled out of control — Cain discovered that Nate was his son, and that Faith knew of his existence and had kept it from them.</p>

      <p>Since this discovery, Cain has distanced himself from Moira — and even slept with Kerry (Laura Norton) to hurt his wife. Regardless, Moira has attempted to save her marriage by any means necessary — and she’s determined to continue seeing the kids.</p>

      <p>However, Cain’s so angry that he’s attempted to prevent Moira from seeing the children, and it’s this attitude that proves problematic in the upcoming episodes, as Kyle asks Moira — who’s noticeably upset — if she can come to his birthday party, but Cain has other plans.</p>
      <p>It’s likely that he’ll pull out all the stops to prevent her from attending, which is a shame because it’s Kyle that’s missing out.</p>
      <p>Perhaps Cain will come to recognise this?</p>
      <p>Or perhaps he will continue to punish Moira for the foreseeable?</p>
      <p>Knowing Cain Dingle, the second option is much more likely.</p>
