      <p>Thousands of South African Airways (SAA) staff began an indefinite strike on Friday after the cash-strapped airline failed to meet a litany of demands, including higher wages and job in-sourcing.</p>
      <p>The strike grounded hundreds of flights, but by Tuesday the airline had resumed partial schedules as some of the 3,000 striking workers had started returning to work.</p>
      <p>South Africa’s Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan attended the latest round of talks on Tuesday — the first time the government was involved since the strike started.</p>

      <p>“This afternoon we will again be meeting the unions to try and find common ground,” chairwoman of the SAA board Thandeka Mgoduso told reporters at a press conference.</p>
      <p>“We are trying everything that we can to resolve the current impasse,” she added.</p>
      <p>Mgoduso said the talks had so far been cordial.</p>
      <p>SAA CEO Zuks Ramasia said the unions had introduced new demands that were not part of the original requests.</p>
      <p>“The company has decided to approach the labour court on an urgent basis to interdict these demands,” Ramasia said.</p>
      <p>“We are open to communicate, we want to talk,” she added.</p>
      <p>The debt-ridden SAA, which has failed to make a profit since 2011 and survives off government bailouts, had initially refused to increase salaries.</p>
      <p>It then caved and offered a 5.9 percent pay rise starting April next year.</p>
      <p>But unions are demanding an eight percent hike and a three-year guarantee of job security.</p>
      <p>Threats to strike started after SAA said last week that almost 1,000 employees could lose their jobs as part of a restructuring process.</p>
      <p>The airline has said it cannot afford the desired increases.</p>
      <p>SAA is Africa’s second largest airline after Ethiopian Airlines.</p>
      <p>It flies to more than more 35 domestic and international destinations, carrying millions of passengers each year.</p>
      <p>South Africa is struggling to get its state-owned companies back on track after nine years of corruption and mismanagement under former president Jacob Zuma. <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-7702143/South-African-Airways-unions-resume-strike-talks.html"><b>AFP</b></a></p>
