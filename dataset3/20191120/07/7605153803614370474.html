        <b>MOMBASA, Kenya, Nov 20 – A 19-year-old was Wednesday morning shot dead by military guards at the Mtongwe naval base for allegedly trespassing a restricted area.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Boda boda riders in the area have in the recent past decried what they termed as incidences of harassment by the military accusing the navy of targeting them.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Leornard Komora, a well-known boda boda rider within Mtongwe area, had gone to pick a passenger near the Mtwonge Navy Estate (KD Estate) at around 6:30am.</p>
      <p>Likoni sub-county police commander Jane Munyoki told Capital FM News that the rider had crossed the barrier leading to the Naval Base.</p>
      <p>“A boda boda rider was shot today morning at the Navy base. He had crossed the barrier. He was asked to stop, but he proceeded,” said Munyoki.</p>
      <p>Munyoki added: “The officer was forced to shoot at the boda boda rider to restrain him, but unfortunately he died instantly.”</p>

      <p>According to boda boda riders within Mtongwe area, Komora had gone to pick a passenger near the Navy base.</p>
      <p>“He was making a turn near the barrier when he was shot. He is not a criminal neither a drug addict,” a boda boda operator said.</p>
      <p>The victim is said to have written his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education exams last year.</p>
      <p>The body has since been moved to Coast General Provincial Hospital.</p>
      <p>Mtongwe residents have raised an alarm over increased cases of harassment from the Kenya Navy officers.</p>
      <p>The officers are sometimes accused of forcing residents to frog jump, do push-ups or clear bushes for trespassing restricted areas.</p>
