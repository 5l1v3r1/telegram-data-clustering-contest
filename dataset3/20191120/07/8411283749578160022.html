      <h1>FitTech secures mini LED equipment orders for shipments in 1H20</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:39:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author">Siu Han, Taipei; Adam Hwang, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>FitTech has landed orders for mini LED probing, testing and sorting equipment totaling NT$1.8 billion (US$59.0 million) with shipments scheduled for first-half 2020, according to company chairman Hsu Chiu-tien.</p>
      <p>This is because demand for fine-pitch mini LED displays and mini LED backlit gaming LCD monitors is expected to fast grow in 2020, Hsu noted. The revenue proportion for such mini LED equipment is expected to rise form 10% at present to 20-30% in 2020, Hsu said at a November 19 investor conference.</p>
      <p>FitTech has reached a market share of over 50% for LED probing equipment and that of 80% for LED sorting equipment in China, with the three largest LED chip makers being clients. FitTech is shipping 1,500 sets of mini LED equipment to China-based Shenzhen MTC, with shipments to be completed by year-end 2019, industry sources said. Currently, China takes up 89% of FitTech's consolidated revenues.</p>
      <p>While micro LED probing differs technlogically from probing for LED or mini LED, FitTech has cooperated with clients to develop micro LED probing equipment and obtained their validation, and may begin small-volume shipments in first-half 2020, but volume shipments will not happen until three years later, FitTech indicated.</p>
      <p>FitTech has developed equipment for testing DFB (distributed feedback) laser diodes used in optical communication and VCSEL diodes used in 3D sensing and IoT. It has also developed laser micromachining equipment for semiconductor and PCB manufacturing processes. The revenue proportion for such equipment is expected to increase from 3% in 2019 to 10% in 2020, FitTech noted.</p>
      <p>FitTech invested in a factory in Malaysia in first-half 2019 for undertaking outsourced probing of mini LED chips. Gross margins for such probing services are 10-20%, much lower than over 30% for equipment sale, and the revenue proportion for probing services in 2019 is estimated at 10%.</p>
      <p>FitTech posted consolidated revenues of NT$873.7 million, gross margin of 31.23%, net operating profit of NT$76.4 million, net profit of NT$55.3 million and net EPS of 0.91 for third-quarter 2019, leading to consolidated revenues of NT$2.929 billion, gross margin of 29.53%, net operating profit of NT$338.2 million, net profit of NT$289.1 million and net EPS of 4.79 for January-September.</p>
      <p>FitTech's October consolidated revenues reached NT$250.4 million, growing 1.09% sequentially but decreasing 34.42% on year, and those of NT$3.157 billion for January-October rose 37.01% on year.</p>
      <p>FitTech will be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in mid-December 2019.</p>
