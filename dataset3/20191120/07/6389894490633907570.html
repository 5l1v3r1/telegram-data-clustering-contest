      <p>Overall, the company secured around £3.5bn worth of contracts in the first half, and said its combined order book and pipeline grew 10 per cent between March and September, hitting a record £34bn.</p>
      <p>The defence firm also announced a new £300m contract to provide training to the Metropolitan Police today.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What Babcock said</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Today’s results show we are doing what we said we would do. Our delivery in the first half is in line with our expectations, with good performance across most of the Group,” said chief executive Archie Bethel. </p>
      <p>“Our strategy is delivering,” he said. “We have continued to expand our international footprint, with new Aviation operations in Norway and Canada and the start of our support of the Australian Navy’s amphibious assault ships. And our pipeline of opportunities has increased to £16 billion as a result of increased bidding activity across our markets. Our combined order book and pipeline of over £34 billion is at its highest level ever.”</p>
