      <h1>Call for self-employed to get a national minimum wage</h1>
      <h2>"Self-employed workers are not protected by the safety net that many of us take for granted, from sick pay to maternity cover."</h2>

      <p>A national minimum wage should be introduced for self-employed workers as a "crucial step" towards improving their financial security, a report has urged.</p>
      <p>Demos said the move would provide a legal obligation on firms to pay their contractors a minimum rate, arguing it should be higher than the regular national minimum wage to cover the additional risk lower-paid self-employed workers are bearing as a result of their financial insecurity.</p>
      <p>Research among 2,000 workers for the think tank found that an overwhelming majority of self-employed people worry about their financial situation, with more than a third not feeling secure about their financial future.</p>
      <p>The report, supported by NatWest, added that workers such as those in the so-called gig economy and the self-employed face greater barriers to financial inclusion compared with other employees.</p>
      <p>They are less likely to hold financial products and are almost twice as likely to be turned down for financial products due to their employment history than traditional employees, said the report.</p>
      <p>Ben Glover, of Demos, said: "Self-employed workers are not protected by the safety net that many of us take for granted, from sick pay to maternity cover.</p>
      <p>"This bargain is only fair if self-employed people earn enough to cover the additional risk they take on, but too often in Britain today this is simply not happening.</p>
      <p>"That's why we are calling for a new, higher minimum wage for the self-employed."</p>
      <p>Marcelino Castrillo, of NatWest, said: "With the rate of innovation and change within the financial services sector, it is vital that we explore how the workforce is changing and how this will impact their financial services requirements."</p>
