        <i><b>Question:</b> I've just turned 60 and have been married to my wife for more than 35 years. While I know she loves me, over the years she has <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/sex-relationships/sex/missing-that-spark-when-youre-having-sex-heres-how-to-get-it-back/news-story/6990120afc3cdd9e6614ff0f9d1693fb">lost interest in sex</a> to the point that these days <a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/sex-relationships/what-to-do-if-youre-in-the-mood-for-sex-but-your-partner-isnt/news-story/cd1de173e248c1ef707ad4ba5c824eda">she’d happily have no sex at all</a> — and my advances are almost entirely rebuffed. The problem is I can’t find release myself as I’m not able to masturbate (perhaps my Catholic upbringing has locked in some guilt that stops me). My question has two parts: is having regular erections without release bad for my health (my prostate, in particular); and what can I do to get my wife i<a href="https://www.bodyandsoul.com.au/sex-relationships/sex/7-unexpected-ideas-to-sexup-date-night/news-story/e922bf6b2658c95090093f1e1fb331bc">nterested in sex again</a>?</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Jacqueline's answer:</h3>
      <p>First up, let me give you some reassurance: there’s no conclusive scientific evidence that men need to ejaculate for their prostate health — some studies even indicate the opposite. So, let’s get that myth out of the way and turn to your question about the act of sex itself.</p>
      <p>To answer your question, it’s important to understand why people want sex, two of the main reasons being: 1) they’re feeling horny and want an orgasmic release; and 2) they want to have a pleasurable, connecting experience with their beloved.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Sometimes the two can happen at once. If your partner is feeling similarly inclined or can be seduced into feeling that way, then all good, you can have a lovely, <a href="https://www.whimn.com.au/love/intimacy/you-can-have-a-marriage-or-a-sex-life-not-both/news-story/689e8c181d74745f2dad0563010fbb81">satisfying sexual encounter</a>. But, what you’re asking is if you’re feeling aroused and your partner isn’t and doesn’t want to engage, then what do you do with that arousal?</p>
      <p>A healthy sex life incorporates both partnered sex and solo sex. Partnered sex is for when you both want a mutually enjoyable encounter for pleasure and connection. Solo sex is when you are aroused and just want an orgasm, particularly if your partner doesn’t or can’t.</p>

      <p>But solo sex is not just the fall back when you can’t get ‘the real thing’. If you can get over your guilt, I want to reassure you that masturbation is part of a normal and healthy sex life — it feels good, relaxing and rejuvenating! In fact, your hands reach to exactly the right length to enable this, and the dexterity of your hands and fingers means you can give yourself just the right kind of stimulation to provide pleasure and orgasmic release.</p>
      <p>Add to that the brilliance of the human mind with all the memories it can recall and fantasies it can create, and you have the perfect combination for a great solo experience that’ll make you feel calm and relaxed, and will no doubt also reduce the pressure you may be putting on your wife.</p>

      <p>Which brings me to the second part of your question — how to get your wife interested. I see so often in my clinic that if one partner is very needy of sex, it can actually push their partner away. Neediness and pushiness are not sexy, and pressure is a big turn-off. So, if you want your wife to join you in sexual connection, you need to entice her. You need to find out what would engage her, how she would like to be approached and what she would find pleasurable.</p>
      <p>This will be a whole lot easier to achieve if you’re not putting pressure on her due to your own desperation from not pleasuring yourself.</p>
      <p>If you’re really struggling, I recommend you get support from a qualified sex therapist. But see how you go and try gradually getting used to pleasuring yourself. Picture your wife in your fantasies and allow yourself the pleasure of orgasmic release while imagining her involvement. Then, at a later time, have a chat with her about how you love the connection and pleasure of making love with her, and how you would like to reinvigorate your love life in a way that would bring her satisfaction and strengthen the beautiful bond you have.</p>
      <p>This relaxed approach is more likely to engage her in conversation and through that to cuddles, kisses and more!</p>
