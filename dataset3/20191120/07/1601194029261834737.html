      <p>The advantage in the Men's WarGames will be hanging in the balance as this week's episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> promises to be a thriller. With just days away from <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt-takeover-wargames-2">NXT TakeOver: WarGames</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a>, we can expect a lot of twists and turns in tonight's edition of the Black &amp; Gold brand.</p>
      <p>Dominik Dijakovic will square-off with the NXT Champion, Adam Cole, with the briefcase containing the advantage for the Men's WarGames. If last week's match between Io Shirai and Mia Yim is anything to go by, expect a barnburner folks.</p>
      <p>This is the first time Dijakovic will be competing as a member of Team Ciampa and he will be looking to impress the Blackheart and his long-time rival, Keith Lee.</p>
      <p>But it will not be an easy task as the Panama City Playboy has been on an absolute roll at the moment.</p>
      <p>Who will come out on top in this match-up?</p>
      <p>It was utter chaos to close the night on this week's RAW. All the three brands were involved in an all-out brawl where NXT reigned supreme. WWE COO Triple H has laid out the challenge to both RAW and SmackDown and said he has kept the doors of Full Sail open for the Red and Blue brand Superstars.</p>
      <p>Will anyone enter through the doors and pick a fight with the Black &amp; Gold brand?</p>
      <p>The Undisputed Era made a statement last week when they crashed the SmackDown Tag Team Championship match between New Day and The Revival. The Top Guys weren't happy with what happened and will be looking to get some retribution on the NXT Tag Team Champions.</p>
      <p>Can the former NXT Tag Team Champs get one over the current ones?</p>
      <p>Guess you will have to tune-in to find out!</p>
