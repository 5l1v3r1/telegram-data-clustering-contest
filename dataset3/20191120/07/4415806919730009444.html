      <h1>Slovakia stand in Ireland's way on route to Euro 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T07:25:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 07:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Ireland's alternate route to Euro 2020 will begin away to Slovakia in March.</p>
      <p>The fixture was confirmed after Wales secured automatic qualification to the finals with a 2-0 win over Hungary in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>Slovakia finished third in Group E, defeating Azerbaijan 2-0 last night.</p>
      <p>Should Ireland beat the Slovaks, they wil face either Northern Ireland or Bosnia-Herzegovina for a place in the finals.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland took the lead away to Germany last night before a <a href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/soccer/northern-ireland-hit-for-six-in-germany-965334.html?utm_source=recirc&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=recirc">Serge Gnabry hat-trick led to them being beaten 6-1 in Frankfurt</a>.</p>
      <p>Ireland fell to a disappointing draw with Denmark on Monday night, a game the Boys In Green needed to win to earn automatic qualification.</p>
      <p>However, manager Mick McCarthy believes his side have every chance of making Euro 2020 if they can replicate their performance against the Danes.</p>
      <p>He said: "If we play as well as that against other teams and we can beat them."</p>
      <p>Shane Duffy, who captained Ireland on Monday night, said: "We’re still in it, we’re not out and we’ve got to do it the hard way, like we always do."</p>
