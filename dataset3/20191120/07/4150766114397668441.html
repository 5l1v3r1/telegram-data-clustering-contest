      <h1>Breaking: Mourinho appointed Spurs boss after Pochettino sacked</h1>

      <p>Jose Mourinho was on Wednesday appointed new Tottenham Hotspur head coach to replace the sacked of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese former Chelsea and Manchester United manager signed a contract until the end of the 2022-23 season, the north London club said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, 47, transformed Spurs' fortunes since arriving from Southampton in 2014, and although he failed to win a trophy he took the club to the Champions League final for the first time in their history just six months ago.</p>
      <p>But the Argentine was sacked on Tuesday with Tottenham languishing 14th in England's Premier League after picking up just three wins from their opening 12 games.</p>
      <p>This season they were knocked out of the League Cup by fourth-tier Colchester United and suffered an embarrassing 7-2 defeat at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," said Mourinho, who has won domestic titles in a record four different countries.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>Spurs Chairman Daniel Levy said: "In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room."</p>
