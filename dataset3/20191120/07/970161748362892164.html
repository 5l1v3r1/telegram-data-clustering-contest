      <p>Aaron Carter has claimed his sister, Angel, lied to the court in order to have his collection of guns taken away from him after requesting a restraining order against the singer.</p>
      <p>The former child star, 31, was in court in Los Angeles on Tuesday, after his sister filed for a restraining order preventing Aaron from having any contact with her or her family for a year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/19/aaron-carter-court-surrender-guns-restraining-order-angel/">TMZ reports</a> that the judge ruled Aaron was also ‘too dangerous to possess guns’, which apparently led to the singer screaming at the judge that he would just go to another state to buy more.</p>
      <p>The saga had begun in September after family members called the police out to Aaron’s house to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/21/nick-carter-afraid-familys-safety-aaron-carter-slams-perez-hiltons-request-remove-guns-10785107/">remove his collection of firearms, including assault rifles as they ‘feared for their safety’.</a></p>

      <p>However, the weapons were not taken at the time as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/17/aaron-carters-guns-wont-taken-away-unless-deemed-mentally-unstable-despite-family-fears-10759623/">police said they would not remove them from his possession unless he was deemed ‘not mentally stable’.</a></p>
      <p>Aaron told fans on Twitter that he felt like he had ‘lost everything’ after the ruling, writing: ‘Lost my court case… lost everything … gotta move ASAP.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘Going on vacation in the mountains with my little baby girl Nala. We are celebrating Thanksgiving together in the snow. She’s all I got to be thankful for and of course all of my LMG.’</p>

      <p>Aaron also posted about the incident on Instagram, writing: ‘I am devastated by what happened in court today.</p>
      <p>‘My sister lied over and over in an effort to take away my 2nd Amendment rights and she did it on behalf of my brother to silence me talking about how he raped and sexually assaulted multiple women.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/18/aaron-carter-calls-brother-nick-rapist-files-restraining-order-10763171/">Melissa Schuman had accused Nick Carter of rape in 2018</a> as she spoke out as part of the #MeToo movement, claiming he had assaulted her in the bathroom of his apartment in Santa Monica in 2002, when she was 18.</p>
      <p>As part of the ruling by the court, Aaron must hand over his gun collection or face jail, and has also been ordered to stay away from The Grove shopping centre in Los Angeles where Angel’s husband works.</p>
