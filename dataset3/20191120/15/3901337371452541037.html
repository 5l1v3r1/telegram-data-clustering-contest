      <h1>Backroom Shake Up At Chloorkop Confirmed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:02:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns, a club that has often been criticised for being inferior to its rivals in as far as administration, has made several appointments this month – one of them very high up the hierarchy – to address that very notion.</p>
      <p>As reported by the Siya crew two weeks ago that Kenneth Makhanya was back at Chloorkop to take over his previous role, it has now been officially confirmed by the club that the veteran administrator has indeed been re-hired as the general manager.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It means Yogesh Singh steps back from an acting capacity and assumes his position as head of legal and commercial as was previously the case.</p>
      <p>Makhanya has already been hard at work and is believed to have already held meetings with the technical team and the backroom staff as Downs makes minimal, but critical, changes to the running of a club that is the most successful in the Premier Soccer League era.</p>
      <p>More appointments were also confirmed to the Siya crew – that of a media and communications officer as well as a brand and marketing specialist.</p>
      <p>Mashupje 'Shupi' Nkgadima arrives to plug the gap left void by Thulani Thuswa, whose departure at Chloorkop was very abrupt and felt by the supporters earlier in the year. Nkgadima has previously worked at Moroka Swallows and Bloemfontein Celtic, as well as briefly being involved as marketing coordinator for the Fifa 2010 World Cup organising committee.</p>
      <p>He is joined by Kylie Isdale, who has a marketing background and has worked at La Liga and Fifa. The duo started work at Sundowns on Monday.</p>
