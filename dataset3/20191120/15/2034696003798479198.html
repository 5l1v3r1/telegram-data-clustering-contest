        <b>But he's not holding out hope...</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/noel-gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a> has revealed that he’d be up for becoming a guitarist in <a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-smiths">The Smiths</a> if the Manchester icons were to ever reunite.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, the High Flying Birds singer revealed that he’s keen on taking the background as a guitarist once more, and later said The Smiths would provide the perfect place to do so.</p>
      <p>“I would love to be in a band and just be a guitarist for a while,” Noel said.</p>
      <p>“Not that band [Oasis], but sometimes when I sit in with [Paul] Weller I just think ‘thank god for that’.”</p>
      <p>When asked by Lowe which band he would “jump at” to join, Noel revealed that the ‘Panic’ band – comprised of Morrissey, Johnny Marr, Mike Joyce, Andy Rourke and later Craig Gannon – would be the ideal choice.</p>

      <p>“I would love, and it’s never gonna happen, it’s a thing in a parallel universe, if The Smiths got back together. I’m Craig Gannon and I’d go to Johnny [Marr] and say don’t get another guitarist mate – I’m your man.”</p>
      <p>This comes after Noel admitted earlier this year that The Smiths were the one band he would love to see reunite.</p>
      <p>“I’m not into reunions and all that,” he <a href="https://www.radiox.co.uk/artists/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds/video-noel-gallagher-love-smiths-reunite/">told Radio X</a>.</p>
      <p>“But if there was one… If I was God for a day… If you could make it happen and they’d all be happy about it happening, I would love to see The Smiths again.”</p>
      <p>But it seems as unlikely as ever, with Johnny Marr <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/johnny-marr-responds-latest-smiths-reunion-rumours-nigel-farage-guitar-2565417">jokingly dismissing the suggestion earlier this month.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Noel’s war of words with estranged brother Liam rages on, with Noel recently admitting that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-says-liams-twitter-account-is-the-reason-why-oasis-will-never-reunite-2568850">Liam’s Twitter account</a> is the reason why Oasis will never reunite.</p>
      <p>Last week, he also released his<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-release-uplifting-new-single-wandering-star-listen-now-2567826"> uplifting new single ‘Wandering Star’</a>, taken from his upcoming third EP, ‘Blue Moon Rising.’</p>
