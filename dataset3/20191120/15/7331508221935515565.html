      <h1>NFL Week 12 early betting look: Cowboys will have a tough time moving the ball on the Patriots</h1>

      <p>We are going to do things a little differently in Week 12. I don't have any futures that I see in the current market that are worth buying, and while I considered selling <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040616/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a> and the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Washington Redskins</a> again, the line has already moved from -2 at open and to -3.5. One should only lay so many points with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574630/jeff-driskel">Jeff Driskel</a> on the road at this point anyway.</p>
      <p>As I was looking over the Week 12 NFL card, four games stood out to me immediately -- the final four on the rotation. They all have major playoff implications, and subsequently, all have point spreads of a touchdown or less. I'm going to buy or sell one aspect of each of these four games and what it means from a betting perspective. There has been line movement around key numbers in all four instances as well, so I will get into the games that moved in line with my projections and the ones that did not. Let's get into it.</p>
