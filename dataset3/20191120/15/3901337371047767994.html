      <p>Having not scored for Kaizer Chiefs for almost two months, Khama Billiat’s brace for Zimbabwe this week could bode well for the Amakhosi’s trophy ambitions…</p>

      <p>Billiat’s last goal for the Glamour Boys came back in September when he helped them to a 2-0 win over AmaZulu in the Absa Premiership, and was only his fourth goal for the club in 2019 so far.</p>
      <p>Now though, on the back of scoring two goals in his nation’s 2021 African Cup of Nations 2-1 victory over Zambia, Ernst Middendorp will be hoping that the attacker comes back with a spring in his step ahead of Sunday’s crucial Telkom Knockout semi-final against Maritzburg United.</p>

      <p>Both of Billiat’s goals were set up by former Chiefs frontman, Knowledge Musona, with the Zimbabwean attacker scoring a header after a corner from the ‘Smiling Assassin’ before the Anderlecht forward set up the Amakhosi man for a winner towards the end of the game.</p>
