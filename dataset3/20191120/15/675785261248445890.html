      <h1>General election: YouGov's small snap poll of undecided voters gives hope for Labour</h1>
      <h2>It should be treated with caution - but a snap poll from ITV's election debate suggested undecided voters were swinging more towards Jeremy Corbyn than Boris Johnson</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:39:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn is used to battling polls that put the Tories far ahead.</p>
      <p>But supporters may take a glimmer of hope from one result that came out after last night's first TV clash of the election campaign.</p>
      <p>YouGov polled 1,646 viewers after the ITV leaders' debate between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> .</p>
      <p>The pollster found 51% backed Johnson as the best performer while 49% backed Corbyn. But with undecided voters, the result was different.</p>
      <p>In that group, 54% said Jeremy Corbyn "performed best overall" in the debate - with just 38% opting for the Tory leader. The rest didn't know.</p>
      <p>The results must be treated with caution because they are a 286-person subset of the overall poll - and the lower the sample size, the worse the accuracy.</p>
      <p>But former YouGov President Peter Kellner said even if it was just "firming up wavering <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> supporters", it was "still significant".</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Among decided voters, the results were stark in the other direction. 51% of the 1,120 decided voters backed Boris Johnson while 44% backed Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The snap poll also found Jeremy Corbyn performed better on the NHS, with 54% of people's support compared to 38% for Boris Johnson, after he claimed the Tories would put the service up for sale after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> .</p>
      <p>But Boris Johnson performed better on Brexit - 63% to 27% - after repeatedly questioning Mr Corbyn on his policy not to decide until next year how Labour would campaign in a second referedum.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>And after the audience laughed when Boris Johnson said truth was important, the poll found Mr Corbyn was more trustworthy - on 45% compared to 40% for the Tory leader.</p>
      <p>It comes after Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn clashed over trust, Christmas presents and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> on Tuesday night in the first TV clash of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> campaign.</p>
      <p>Audience members <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/itv-election-debate-audience-bursts-20917616">laughed as the Tory leader said the truth was important</a> - despite <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/itv-general-election-debate-4-20918081">making a string of dodgy claims</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/election-debate-tories-accused-misleading-20917806">his party trying to style themselves as factcheckers.</a></p>
      <p>Mr Johnson was also <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/election-debate-awkward-moment-boris-20917938">quizzed on Prince Andrew after ducking questions yesterday.</a> And he said he'd get <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> his Brexit deal for Christmas, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/election-debate-boris-johnson-jeremy-20917960">before settling on a jar of damson jam.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jeremy Corbyn <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/election-debate-jeremy-corbyns-perfect-20917605">shot back at claims he'd stitch up a coalition with Nicola Sturgeon</a> to get into 10 Downing Street.</p>
