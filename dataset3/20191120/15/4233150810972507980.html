      <h1>Rīga Mayor Burovs offers to resign pending coalition formation</h1>

        <b>Rīga City Council Mayor Oļegs Burovs (Honor to Serve Riga (GKR)) promised to resign from his position and call an emergency election himself if he is unsuccessful in securing a majority coalition in the Rīga City Council, he said in an interview with Latvian Radio on November 20.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Burovs after cooperation was ended with the so-called independent council members the coalition was left with a minority of 28 council members from GKR and Harmony. He indicated that he will attempt to speak to other council members in hopes of securing a majority, excluding the four council members previously expelled from Harmony.</p>
      <blockquote>“If we won't get a majority, especially before accepting the budget (..), if there will be a boycott, of course I'll leave and propose an emergency election,” said Burovs.</blockquote>
      <p>He indicated that by the end of November or beginning of December it will be clear if he will succeed, adding that emergency elections are not necessary or in the interest of Rīgans. Burovs hopes to secure a stable majority, as it will be difficult to continue work and, for example, go on business trips with only a slight majority. </p>
      <p>As previously <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/olegs-burovs-becomes-new-mayor-of-riga.a329160/">reported</a>, Rīga gained its third mayor of the year on August 19 with the election of Oļegs Burovs of the Honor to Serve Rīga party to the post. Following a marathon and frequently bad-tempered sitting of the city council, Burovs was elected chairman of the Riga City Council and hence mayor, with the support of 35 deputies.</p>
      <p>Also <a href="https://eng.lsm.lv/article/politics/politics/split-at-riga-city-council-as-four-harmony-deputies-expelled.a320948/">reported</a>, Harmony councilors Vadims Baraņņiks – and former vice-mayor – as well as Valērijs Petrovs, Vitālijs Dubovs and Aleksejs Rosļikovs refused to support Sandris Bergmanis (Harmony) for vice-mayor and Oļegs Burovs (GKR) as board member at the Rīga Free Port.</p>
      <p>These members were promptly expelled from the council faction for having "grossly violated party discipline,'' said Harmony leader and former Rīga Mayor Nils Ušakovs. They have been expelled from the party as well.<br/> </p>
