        <li>Pentagon funds totalling $35 million earmarked for military aid for Ukraine have yet to be released, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-19/documents-show-nearly-40-million-in-ukraine-aid-delayed-despite-white-house-assurances">the Los Angeles Times reported</a>.</li>
        <li>The funds are part of a $400 million military aid package to Ukraine frozen by President Donald Trump, a move being probed by the House impeachment probe.</li>
        <li>Much of the aid has now been distributed, but the last $35 million has not. The Pentagon declined to explain why.</li>

      <p>More than $35 million in Pentagon aid to Ukraine is yet to be released, according to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2019-11-19/documents-show-nearly-40-million-in-ukraine-aid-delayed-despite-white-house-assurances">a report by the Los Angeles Times</a>, citing government documents.</p>
      <p>The sum is part of the congressionally-approved $400 million aid package the Trump administration froze earlier this year, which Democrats are probing as part of their impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>Several witnesses in the inquiry have testified that the aid was withheld as part of a bid to pressure Ukraine to announce a probe into Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, in a move that Democrats say constitutes an impeachable abuse of power by Trump.</p>
      <p>Republicans have claimed that Ukraine did not know the aid had been withheld, so withholding it could not have been part of a pressure campaign.</p>
      <p>Most of the package, which was distributed by the State Department, was released in September 2019, after reports emerged of a whistleblower complaint about Trump’s demand in a July 25 phonecall with Ukraine’s president that he launch a probe of Biden.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon in a statement to the Times confirmed that the $35 million, earmarked for “grenade launchers, secure communications and naval combat craft,” had not been released, but declined to say why.</p>
      <p>Pentagon spokesperson Lt. Col. Carla Gleason told the publication the funds will be distributed “over the next several weeks.”</p>
