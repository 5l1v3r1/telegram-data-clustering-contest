      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/game-of-thrones">Game of Thrones</a> fans can now sail across the Seven Kingdoms thanks to a brand new cruise package.</p>
      <p>The aptly-named 'Cruise of Thrones' is an epic 16-day itinerary which will be visiting heaps of the hit TV <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/europe/game-of-thrones-locations-tours-13311828">show's filming locations</a> across the likes of Iceland, Croatia, Spain and Malta.</p>
      <p>Sailing in September 2021, the cruise will also feature heaps of extra fun for passengers including fancy dress offerings, panels, podcast recordings, lectures and even potentially a celebrity appearance or two.</p>
      <p>It's sure to make for quite the adventure; after all, Game of Thrones boasts some glamorous filming locations.</p>
      <p>For example, in Iceland the itinerary will feature visits to iconic spots such as the Fist of the First Men, the Bloody Gate and Jon &amp; Ygritte’s cave, while in Ireland you can head to the likes of The Wall, Castle Black, Hardhome, Winterfell, Pyke and the King’s Road.</p>

      <p>Sunnier climates await too, with stops in Spain where you can see the locations used for Sunspear and the Water Gardens, the Tower of Joy, the Long Bridge of Volantis and even The Citadel.</p>
      <p>The itinerary even includes a stop to Malta, which served as the first home of King's Landing, and was also used for filming scenes in Mdina.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dubrovnik - which famously served as King's Landing - also features on the list, including the same route which Cersei embarked on for her walk of shame.</p>
