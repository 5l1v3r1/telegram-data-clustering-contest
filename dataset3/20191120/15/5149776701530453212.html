      <p>Your favourite pampered pooch need not be left out of the fast-approaching Yuletide party season, at least not at one of Nottinghamshire's grandest stately homes.</p>
      <p>Historic 15th century Thrumpton Hall will be throwing <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> parties for dogs as part of its festive celebrations - and in keeping with the locations, they're naturally pretty posh. <br/><br/>Organised by Regal Wagmore, a private portrait photography company based at the hall, packages start from £300 - and can include anything from coffee and light refreshments through to a sumptuous three course champagne luncheon rounded off with a classic afternoon tea.</p>
      <p>Visitors can also recreate history and get the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/downton-abbey">Downton Abbey</a> treatment with a fun period photoshoot - which can include furry friends, of course.</p>
