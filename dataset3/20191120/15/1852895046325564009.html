      <h1>The November Democratic Debate: When &amp; How To Watch, &amp; Everything Else You Need To Know</h1>

      <h4>Tune into the Dem debate on Nov. 20 to see candidates including Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders duke it out for the chance to beat Trump in 2020. Here’s the info you need before watching.</h4>
      <p>Aaaand we’re back. The fifth Democratic presidential debate airs tonight, November 20, and it may be the most contentious debate yet. Popular candidate <b>Beto O’Rourke</b> (and less popular candidate <b>Tim Ryan</b>) has now dropped out of the race, leaving more room for the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/07/michelle-obama-when-we-all-vote-campaign-2020-election/">qualifying candidates</a> to butt heads onstage.  And they certainly will. As of this morning, <b>Joe Biden</b> is leading in the polls, followed closely behind by<b> Elizabeth Warren</b> and<b> Bernie Sanders</b>. <b>Pete Buttigieg</b> is staying steady in fourth place at the moment, with the other candidates trailing <i>significantly</i>.</p>
      <p>But, at this time, we still must listen to 10 candidates debate onstage, this time in Atlanta, Georgia. The debate, held at Tyler Perry Studios, is co-hosted by NBC News and <i>The Washington Post</i>. It will air from 9:00pm ET to 11:00pm ET on MSNBC, as well as the network’s site. Click <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/">HERE</a> to watch NBC News’ free live stream. For only the second time in presidential primary debate history, all four moderators will be women — MSNBC’s <b>Rachel Maddow</b>, <b>Andrea Mitchell</b>, and <b>Kristen Welker</b>, as well as WaPo’s <b>Ashley Parker</b>. It’s almost certain that the candidates will be grilled about the current House <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/what-is-impeachment-how-does-it-work-3800183/">impeachment inquiry</a>, which has now entered its fourth day of public testimony.</p>
      <p>The following candidates are debating on November 20:</p>
      <p>Former Vice President <b>Joe Biden</b><br/>New Jersey Senator <b>Cory Booker</b><br/>South Bend Mayor <b>Pete Buttigieg</b><br/>Hawaii Representative <b>Tulsi Gabbard</b><br/>California Senator <b>Kamala Harris</b><br/>Minnesota Senator <b>Amy Klobuchar</b><br/>Delaware Senator <b>Bernie Sanders</b><br/>Businessman <b>Tom Steyer</b><br/>Massachusetts Senator <b>Elizabeth Warren</b><br/>Businessman <b>Andrew Yang</b></p>
      <p>And these candidates didn’t qualify for the November debate (some haven’t qualified for any of them). But they’re working toward that December deadline:</p>
      <p>Colorado Senator <b>Michael Bennet</b><br/>Montana Governor <b>Steve Bullock</b><br/>Former HUD Secretary <b>Julián Castro</b><br/>Former Maryland Rep. <b>John Delaney</b><br/>Miramar, Florida Mayor <b>Wayne Messam </b><br/>Former Massachusetts Governor <b>Deval Patrick</b><br/>Former Pennsylvania Rep. <b>Joe Sestak</b><br/>Author <b>Marianne Williamson</b></p>
      <p>An updated list of Democrats who have dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, in case you need a refresher:</p>
      <p>NYC Mayor <b>Bill de Blasio</b><br/>New York Senator <b>Kirsten Gillibrand</b><br/>Former Colorado Governor <b>John Hickenlooper</b><br/>Washington State Governor <b>Jay Inslee</b><br/>Former Texas Rep. <b>Beto O’Rourke</b><br/>Ohio Rep. <b>Tim Ryan</b><br/>Massachusetts Rep. <b>Seth Moulton</b><br/>California Rep. <b>Eric Swalwell</b></p>
      <p>NYC’s controversial former mayor, <b>Michael Bloomberg</b>, has filed the paperwork to run for president in Alabama and Arkansas, but has not officially entered the 2020 race. Tune in next month, on December 19, for the sixth and final Democratic debate of 2019.</p>
