      <h1>Sondland says he believed Ukraine did not actually have to conduct investigations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:46:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/brett-samuels" target="_blank">Brett Samuels</a></address>
      <p>Sondland declined to speculate on Trump's motivations for seeking investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens.</p>
      <p>The ambassador to the EU has said Wednesday morning that there was a quid pro quo tying a White House meeting for Zelensky to him making a public declaration that he would follow through on investigations Trump sought.</p>
      <p>"I never heard ... anyone say that the investigations had to start or had to be completed," Sondland told the Democratic counsel of the House Intelligence Committee. "The only thing I heard from Mr. Giuliani or otherwise is they had to be announced in some form" publicly.</p>
      <p>Sondland declined to speculate on Trump's motivations for seeking investigations into the 2016 election and the Bidens. But Democrats are likely to seize on his comments that an actual investigation was not necessary to argue that Trump was merely interested in the appearance of Biden being under investigation.</p>
      <p>Biden is among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.</p>
      <p>Democrats' impeachment inquiry has focused on whether Trump abused his office by pressuring a foreign government to investigate his political rivals.</p>
