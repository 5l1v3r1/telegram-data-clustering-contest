      <h1>'A towering performance': Bristol City's Joe Morrell impresses once again as Wales beat Adam Nagy's Hungary to qualify for Euros</h1>
      <h2>Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey scored both goals in a 2-0 win</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:37:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City and Wales fans alike have once again been praising the performance of Joe Morrell in a Wales shirt.</p>
      <p>The young Bristol City midfielder, who is currently on loan at Lincoln City, played 60 minutes last night as Wales qualified for the European Championships in 2020 by beating Hungary 2-0.</p>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey scored both goals as Ryan Giggs's side dominated Hungary.</p>
      <p>Morrell was given a surprise start in the 2-0 win over Azerbaijan on Saturday, but outshone Gareth Bale to earn himself a place in the starting XI in the crucial match versus Hungary.</p>
      <p>Wales needed a win in the match to automatically qualify.</p>
      <p>Fellow City teammate Ashley Williams didn't feature, but both have played a part in finishing one spot above <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/adam-nagy-making-injury-worse-3552321">Adam Nagy's Hungary.</a></p>
      <p>Nagy also featured in the game, but couldn't stop his side going down to the likes of Morrell, Gareth Bale and Ben Davies.</p>
      <p>Morrell was given a rating of 9/10 by <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/magnificent-wales-player-ratings-one-17283214">WalesOnline writer Paul Abbandonato</a> , who wrote: "Chosen ahead of Ethan Ampadu, he once again belied the fact that he plays for Lincoln City with a towering international performance.</p>
      <p>"What a couple of matches he has just had."</p>

      <p>Fans were loving his performance online. Dan Jones said: "Could have easily dropped Joe Morrell tonight because he wasn’t a big name but stuck with him. Don’t think he’ll be playing for Lincoln next season."</p>
      <p>And Josh Hicks said: "Joe Morrell putting in another shift for Wales, can’t be long till he’s with the first team at City."</p>
