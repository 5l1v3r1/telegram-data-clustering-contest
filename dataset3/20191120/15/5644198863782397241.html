      <p>SINGAPORE: The Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS) has said it is “seriously concerned” about the “lack of finality” on Utico’s offer for home-grown water treatment firm Hyflux, with the Middle Eastern investor repeatedly introducing changes to the deal at the last minute.</p>
      <p>A press statement issued by SIAS chief David Gerald on Wednesday (Nov 20) read: “SIAS is concerned that while Hyflux, together with the various creditor groups, have been working within the timelines as required by the court to try and work out a deal acceptable to everyone, some deal changes have been repeatedly introduced at the eleventh hour by the investor.”</p>

      <p>The investor advocacy group added that it hopes a deal – an outcome which would benefit many stakeholders, including retail investors – would not be scuttled by “such strategies designed to achieve advantages for one party only”.</p>
      <p>“SIAS urges all parties, including the investor to continue negotiations with a view to achieve a commercially acceptable outcome for all stakeholders involved including in particular, the holders of the perpetual securities and preference shares.”</p>
      <p>CNA has reached out to Utico for comments.</p>

      <p>The United Arab Emirates utility firm has said in July that it is willing to take an <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-utico-progressing-binding-investment-deal-400-million-11710726">88 per cent stake</a> in Hyflux through S$300 million in equity injection as well as a S$100 million shareholder loan.</p>
      <p>It also intends to offer the cash equivalent of a 4 per cent stake in the enlarged Utico group, plus additional cash to the holders of preference shares and perpetual securities.</p>
      <p>Both parties have been in talks since and despite <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/hyflux-utico-less-than-48-hours-sign-restructuring-deal-12050228">repeated deadlines</a> issued by Utico, a definitive agreement has not been signed.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Hyflux's lawyer told the High Court earlier this month that some of the terms in the agreement are not “commercially acceptable” to the firm and its stakeholders.</p>
      <p>The fallen water treatment giant, whose restructuring journey has been marked by several twists and turns thus far, has court protection from its creditors until Dec 2.</p>
      <p>A High Court hearing has been scheduled on Nov 29 to consider any further applications or extensions of the debt moratorium.</p>
