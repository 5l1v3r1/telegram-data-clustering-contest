      <p>Sydney's Rufus Du Sol were also nominated in the Best Dance Recording category for <i>Underwater</i>.</p>
      <p>Australia's other nominees included For King &amp; Country who also received two nods.</p>
      <p>They were nominated for Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance or Song for <i>God Only Knows</i>, their collaboration with Dolly Parton, and Best Contemporary Christian Music Album for <i>Burn the Ships</i>.</p>
      <p>Baz Luhrmann also received a nod for Moulin Rouge! The Musical for Best Musical Theatre Album.</p>
      <p>Overall, US rapper Lizzo led the Grammy nominations with eight nods, followed by 17-year-old alt-pop sensation Billie Eilish and country rapper Lil Nas X with six apiece.</p>
      <p>Lizzo, Eilish and Lil Nas X scored nods for the top awards - album and record of the year, as well as best new artist.</p>
      <p>The trio will compete in the album of the year race with Bon Iver, Lana del Rey, Ariana Grande, Vampire Weekend and H.E.R.</p>
      <p>The three artists have enjoyed a break-out year with hits like <i>Truth Hurts</i> (Lizzo), <i>Bad Guy</i> (Eilish) and <i>Old Town Road</i> (Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus).</p>
      <p>Their domination of the nominations injected new life into the Grammy Awards, overshadowing established artists including Taylor Swift, who was omitted from the album and record of the year categories.</p>
      <p>Swift, whose new album <i>Lover</i> is one of the year's biggest sellers, was nominated for song of the year for the title track and for best pop vocal album and pop solo performance.</p>
      <p>The Grammy Awards, chosen by members of the Recording Academy, are the highest honors in the music industry.</p>

      <p>The upcoming Grammy Awards marks the inaugural ceremony under the leadership of Deborah Dugan, the first female president in the history of the Recording Academy.</p>
      <p>In August, she took the reins from Neil Portnow, who ran the organisation for 17 years; in his final year, he sparked controversy by suggesting that women needed to "step up" to win more awards after only one solo female artist was given a trophy during the 2018 Grammys telecast.</p>
