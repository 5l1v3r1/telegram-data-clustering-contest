      <p>Princess Anne, accompanied by Algernon Heber-Percy, the Lord Lieutenant of Shropshire, officially opened the Shropshire college’s Lower School 20 years ago and the 20-year anniversary letter from the Princess Royal was given pride of place at the celebrations.</p>
      <p>The afternoon tea included former Lower School heads, present pupils, their teachers and guests with music for the occasion provided by the Lower School Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Sharon Owen, head of Lower School, said: “It was a memorable celebration to mark our 20th anniversary. It was lovely to see so many people there, the tea was amazing, enjoyed by all and everyone wanted a look at the letter from the Princess Royal.</p>
      <p>“The college has seen a number of innovative developments over the years in Lower School and it plays an integral role in the life of the college - it’s a launchpad for pupils to successfully take the next steps on their all-important academic, artistic and sporting educational journey which prepares them for life after school.”</p>
      <p>A junior section has been in place at the college for more than 50 years but it was not until 1999 that a dedicated building and play area was created on the same site as the senior school.</p>
