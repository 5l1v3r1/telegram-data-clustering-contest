      <p>When <b>Tesla</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tsla-stock-quote/"><b><u>TSLA</u></b></a>) reported third quarter 2019 results, TSLA stock moved higher even as revenue declined on a year-on-year basis. The upside was triggered by record vehicle production and delivery. Since more Model 3 vehicles were sold, the average selling price declined. However, TSLA reported yet another quarter of positive operating cash flows.</p>

      <p>I believe that the decline in the company’s top-line could reverse in 2020 and 2021. This could then take Tesla stock higher from current levels, leading me to maintain a “positive” outlook on the stock. One of the key reasons for this view is the anticipated launch of the company’s pickup truck.</p>
      <h3>Bullish on the Cybertruck</h3>
      <p>The company’s cybertruck will be unveiled on Nov. 21, 2019 and could be game changing in terms of volume growth. If we look back at Tesla’s trailing 12-month vehicle deliveries, those remained below 100,000 until Q3 2017. The launch of Model 3 more than tripled in deliveries within two years. For Q3 2019, the TTM vehicle deliveries were close to 350,000 units.</p>
      <p>A similar volume bump-up is likely after the launch of the pickup trucks. Two factors lead me to this view. One, Elon Musk believes that the pickup truck will be Tesla’s “<a href="https://electrek.co/2019/10/23/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-elon-musk-best-product-ever/">best product ever</a>.” This indicates strong conviction on the model design and potential performance. And, two, pickup sales in the U.S. are booming. <b>Ford</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/f-stock-quote/"><b><u>F</u></b></a>) reported Q3 2019 <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/857684434/files/doc_news/2019/10/Ford-3Q2019-US-Sales-Results.pdf">sales of 240,387 pickups</a>. This implies annualized sales of nearly 1 million units. Musk is talking about <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/06/02/tesla-pickup-truck-price-f150-elon-musk/">pickups that will be attractively priced</a> with a 400-500-mile range. Considering the addressable market, volume growth can be robust.</p>
      <p>And that addressable market? Consider that <a href="https://www.marklines.com/en/statistics/flash_sales/salesfig_usa_2019">9.9 million units of pickup and SUVs have been sold</a> in the U.S. year-to-date, which implies annual sales of approximately 13.3 million units.</p>
      <p>If Tesla’s cybertruck can impress the markets, even a 10% market share would imply sales of 1.3 million units. Therefore, the pickup does have the potential to boost volumes.</p>
      <h3>No Equity Dilution Likely for Europe Gigafactory</h3>
      <p>Tesla has chosen <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-4-german-officials-statement/">Berlin for gigafactory four</a>. According to reports, the factory outside the German capital is likely to <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/tesla-factory-outside-berlin-to-cost-4-billion/a-51286353">cost $4.4 billion</a> and will be completed by the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>I don’t expect Tesla will require external financing in the form of leveraging or equity dilution. For the quarter ended September 2019, Tesla reported cash &amp; equivalents of $5.3 billion. In addition, TSLA has reported positive free cash flow for the last three quarters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the cash buffer should ideally increase and it makes Tesla self sufficient in terms of funding growth. Increase in cash flows is also positive from a valuation perspective. TSLA stock moved higher in Q3 2019 even with decline in revenue. A key reason was positive cash flows.</p>
      <p>Tesla did mention in its report for the period that “we continue to believe our <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/47313d21-3cac-4f69-9497-d161bce15da4">business has grown to the point of being self-funding</a>.” This seems very likely.</p>
      <p>In relation to the gigafactory in China and Europe, Tesla will be able to cut cost-per-car over time. With economies of scale, this will boost the company’s EBITDA margin and cash flows.</p>
      <h3>Final Words on TSLA Stock</h3>
      <p>TSLA stock has been trending higher post third quarter results and I believe that the positive trend will sustain. With the company pricing Model 3s on par with gasoline-powered mid-sized sedans, Tesla expects to gain market share in China in the coming quarters. It is worth noting that China is the largest market for mid-size premium sedans.</p>
      <p>Further, Model Y is also scheduled for launch in summer 2020. The first look of cybertruck this week, along with information on its features, will also add to the positive momentum. I believe that the pickup market will be a game changer for Tesla in the next 24-36 months.</p>
      <p>Overall, there are several reasons to be bullish on Tesla stock and the company is well positioned for value creation as cash flow grows.</p>
