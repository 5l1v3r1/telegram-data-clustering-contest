        <b>Gareth Bale's days at Real Madrid appear to be numbered after he posed with a flag captioned, 'Wales. Golf. Madrid', following Wales' 2-0 victory over Hungary last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bale, 30, has won three Champions League titles among other honours in his six years at the Bernabeu but he's not a popular figure in Madrid.</p>
      <p>This isn't helped by the fact he's openly admitted he prefers playing for Wales, while his passion for golf is often used as another criticism of the winger.</p>
      <p>Former Real star Pedja Mijatovic underline this when he criticised Bale on Spanish radio, claiming that the former Tottenham star's priorities were Wales, golf, Madrid, in that order.</p>

      <p>Bale didn't help matters when he admitted to finding chants about it amusing, and he's sparked fury in Spain by posing with the flag after Wales secured Euro 2020 qualification.</p>
      <p>The majority of readers in a <i>MARCA</i> poll stated that Bale showed "a lack of respect for the club and fans".</p>
      <p>The popular Spanish outlet added that the relationship between Bale and Real manager Zinedine Zidan was "broken for good".</p>
      <p>The headline in <i>AS</i> read:  "Bale is 'mocking' Madrid with the 'Wales. Golf. Madrid' flag."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <i>SPORT</i> suggested Bale should be punished by the club.</p>
      <p>Real are yet to comment on the incident.</p>
      <p>Bale's relationship with Zidane has been poor for some time now and he came close to joining Chinese club Jiangsu Suning in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>Bale was reportedly set to earn £1m-a-week in the Chinese Super League.</p>
