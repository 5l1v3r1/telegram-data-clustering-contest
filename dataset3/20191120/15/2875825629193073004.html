      <p>Aaron is also banned from contacting sister Angel or her family for 12-months and has to keep away from The Grove shopping mall in LA as that is Angelâ€™s husbands place of work.</p>
      <p>It comes after the singer sparked a wave of concern when two of his siblings - including big brother Nick Carter - obtained restraining orders to keep him away from them and their families.</p>
      <p>They claimed they had felt in dancer over 'increasingly alarming behaviour' from Aaron, who had flaunted his firearms collection on social media.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters as he ran errands in Lancaster, California, at the end of the September, Aaron said: "[I'm] good man, everything's good."</p>

      <p>"In light of Aaron's increasingly alarming behaviour and his recent confessions that he harbours thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child, we were left with no choice but to take every measure possible to protect ourselves and our family."</p>
      <p>Nick continued to say that he hopes Aaron seeks help: "We love our brother and truly hope he gets the proper treatment he needs before any harm comes to himself or anyone else."</p>
      <p>Aaron acknowledged the restraining order on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> but denied the allegations of threatening behaviour.</p>
      <p>He said: "I am astounded at the accusations being made against me and I do not wish harm to anyone, especially my family."</p>
