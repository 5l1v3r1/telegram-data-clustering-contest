      <p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday attached valuable animal trophies and furniture made of rosewood valued at over Rs 117 crore along with other movable properties in a cheating case.</p>
      <p>The agency attached 70 animal trophies, rosewood furniture, two immovable properties (measuring 220.19 acres) worth Rs 117.87 crore from a man, who had allegedly cheated the British taxidermist of the Maharaja of Mysore.</p>
      <p>Michael Floyd Eshwer's properties were attached by ED under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).</p>
      <p>The investigation was conducted by the ED based on a chargesheet filed by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Bengaluru against Michael Floyd Eshwer and others under section several sections of the Indian Penal Code and Wild Life Protection Act, 1972.</p>
      <p>The FIR in the case was registered at Nazarabad Police Station in Mysuru, based on a complaint by Late Edwin Joubert Van Ingen, the British taxidermist who worked for the Maharaja of Mysore.</p>
      <p>The Bengaluru Crime Investigation Department (CID) conducted investigation in the case based on an order issued by the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The investigation revealed that Micheal Floyd Eshwer, a horse trainer by profession, created false adoption deed in his favour and obtained a false death certificate of Veningen. He then fraudulently got the properties transferred in his name.</p>
      <p>An officer from the investigating team said, "Michael Floyd Eshwer, who was training horses in Mysore, came to know about Edwin Joubert Veningen and his properties, which were gifted by the Maharaja of Mysore for his services. Michael Floyd Eshwer came to know that Edwin Joubert Veningen was unmarried, single and aging. He took advantage of it and fraudulently took possession of the property held by Edwin Joubert Veningen by way of cheating," said an officer.</p>
      <p>According to the federal probe agency, investigations conducted under PMLA revealed that accused Michael Floyd Eshwer cheated Van Ingen with help from other suspects named in the FIR.</p>
      <p>"In this manner, he fraudulently acquired two immovable properties from Edwin Joubert Van Ingen. Further, Micheal Floyd Eshwer projected the properties as untainted properties and thus committed offence of money laundering," added the agency.</p>
