      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): Boustead Heavy Industries Corp Bhd (BHIC) saw its net profit fall 72.4% to RM3.28 million or 1.32 sen per share for its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, from RM11.87 million or 4.78 sen per share a year earlier.</p>
      <p>This comes on the back of a 40.7% drop in revenue to RM36.41 million from RM61.42 million, according to the group’s filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>Cumulative net profit for the nine-month period tumbled 91.9% to RM1.92 million or 0.77 sen per share, from RM23.59 million or 9.49 sen per share during the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Revenue for the period fell 15.74% to RM126.64 million from RM150.3 million.</p>
      <p>BHIC said earnings were lower due to a variation in milestones achieved from defence-related maintenance, repair and overhaul projects, lower contribution from the joint ventures and higher finance costs.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, the group plans to expand its customer base to other government and non-governmental agencies as well as to penetrate Southeast Asian and Middle East markets.</p>
      <p>BHIC said it will continue to be instrumental in shaping the direction of local naval shipbuilding industry for the long-term, targeting to fulfil the Royal Malaysian Navy’s requirement by focusing on participating in the construction of the littoral combat ship, littoral mission ship, multi-role support ships and new generation patrol vessels.</p>
      <p>Shares of Boustead Heavy Industries closed two sen or 1.54% lower at RM1.28 today, valuing the group at RM318.03 million.</p>
