      <p>Gareth Bale risked the wrath of the Real Madrid fans after posing with a banner mocking the club - but Zinedine Zidane will ignore the controversial incident.</p>
      <p>Bale helped his country qualify for Euro 2020 on Tuesday night, after Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to secure their passage through to next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>After the game Bale joined in on the celebrations with his team and was seen holding the flag, with the words "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."</p>
      <p>The banner seemingly mocks the La Liga giants with the claim that they are only third in Bale's list of priorities - and supporters in Spain are not happy.</p>

      <p>But Spanish daily <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2019/11/20/5dd52a89ca4741df448b45ee.html">Marca</a> has claimed that Zidane will ignore Bale's provocation and is more concerned with his performances on the pitch.</p>
      <p>It is understood that the French boss will welcome Bale back from international duty as if the incident never happened, meaning the Welsh superstar will not be punished by the club.</p>
      <p>However this may further anger Madrid fans, who have hit out at Bale.</p>
      <p>Spanish publication <a href="https://twitter.com/MadridSports_">Madrid Sports</a> tweeted a video of the incident along with the caption: "We have always defended you, Gareth Bale.</p>

      <p>"We have had patience with your injuries, we have celebrated your goals and assists, and we have defended your passion for golf and your limited Spanish.</p>
      <p>"But enough is enough. As it says on the flag, you are laughing at Madrid."</p>
      <p>Bale has only featured in six La Liga games all season, and was set to leave last summer, only for the club to deny him a move to China at the last minute.</p>

      <p>He recently admitted he prefers playing for the national team than for Madrid, saying: "It's like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>"It's normal- with Wales, I'm speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement playing with Wales."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Bale is involved when Madrid take on Real Sociedad in La Liga on Saturday.</p>
