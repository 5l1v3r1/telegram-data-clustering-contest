      <p>Seasoned veteran Carmelo Anthony is back in the NBA, having signed with the Trail Blazers, and on Tuesday, he suited up for his first game action in over a year.</p>
      <p>Anthony hadn’t seen minutes in an NBA contest since Nov. 8, 2018, as a member of the Rockets. He was released shortly thereafter, and has been out of the league since. It’s unclear exactly why, but there were rumors circulating about him being unhappy to come off the bench, and also his issues on the defensive end of the floor.</p>
      <p>He poked fun at one of them recently, when speaking to reporters for the first time since signing with the team. Melo fielded a question about potentially coming off the Blazers bench, and he responded with this funny one-liner.</p>
      <p>“Who, me?” Melo asked, with a laugh.</p>
