        <b>Anyone who hasn’t heard of Black Friday by now has probably been living under a rock. Originating in America, this spectacular savings event has now made its way across the pond, causing similarly frenzied shopping scenes in the UK.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With many deals now offered online as well as in store, you can avoid being trampled in the crush this Black Friday and take advantage of the biggest price drops across laptops, smartphones, white goods, TVs, consoles and more from the comfort of your own home. And to make shopping on Black Friday even easier, you can find all the very best offers right here on the pages of Trusted Reviews.</p>
      <p>But before we get to that, let’s establish when exactly Black Friday 2019 is – not to mention <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/black-friday/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals-3934683">Cyber Monday</a> too. Here is everything you need to know ahead of the biggest sales event of the year.</p>
      <h3>When is Black Friday 2019?</h3>
      <p>As Trusted Reviews has covered the origins of this annual event elsewhere, here it will suffice to say that Black Friday’s date is determined by history.</p>
      <p>Linked to the Thanksgiving in the US, which is always celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November, Black Friday falls the very next day, on the fourth Friday of November.</p>
      <p>We’ll leave the precise reasons for another time as we’re sure you’re keen to find out this year’s Black Friday date.</p>
      <p>Thanksgiving 2019 takes place later than usual, on Thursday 28 November, which means<b> Black Friday 2019 falls on Friday 29 November</b>.</p>
      <h3>When is Cyber Monday 2019?</h3>
      <p>Now we’ve covered Black Friday, what about Cyber Monday?</p>
      <p>If your guess is that Cyber Monday falls three days after Black Friday, then you’re spot on, and Cyber Monday marks the grand finale to a weekend of a brilliant last-minute deals.</p>
      <p>With Black Friday taking place so late in November this year, <b>Cyber Monday 2019 takes place on 2 December.</b></p>
      <p>This will be your last chance this side of Christmas to bag yourself some great savings on tech, so keep reading to find out more.</p>
      <h3>How long does Black Friday last?</h3>
      <p>That’s a hard question to answer precisely, the answer to this will most likely continue to change during our lifetimes, as companies keep lengthening the sales. When they started, Black Friday and its more recent offshoot, Cyber Monday, were merely single days: bargain hunters had only 48-hours to seek out an capitalize on the best deals. Now it’s more unpredictable, but <b>many deals will start to emerge from November 1st onwards.</b></p>
      <p>Initially growing into a weeklong celebration, as Black Friday has become a more universal event, greater numbers of retailers have gotten involved and the celebrations have continued to grow. Retailers feel the need to start setting up deals earlier and earlier to try and undercut their competition.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Cyber Monday is a much larger affair than it used to be, and the distinction between it and Black Friday has blurred. No longer just a day for purchasing tech online, <b>you will now find Cyber Monday deals in brick and mortar stores as well. They will also likely be available for the entire week. </b>This will truly be a good time to get the Christmas shopping sorted, with deals to be found well into the start of Advent.</p>
      <h3>When do the Black Friday Sales start at different retailers?</h3>
      <p>In recent years, the exact dates the Black Friday deals start rolling in have become a bit of a free-for-all. Fewer and fewer retailers are holding out until the official date before showing their variety of discounted goods.</p>
      <p>In the past couple of years <b>Currys PC World</b> has been one of the first out of the gate, with its Black Tag event launching as early as the beginning of November in Black Friday seasons gone by. This year, however, the Currys PC World Black Tag event only very recently kicked off with its price guarantee promotion, promising that if you see a product for a lower price over Black Friday, Currys PC World will refund you the difference.</p>
      <p><b>Very</b> also has its Black Friday sales in full swing, allowing customers to make the most of its Buy Now, Pay Later finance option, to better budget for those bigger investments as well as those guilty treats. Running until 4 December, the retailer’s sale encompasses both Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>Of course, <b>Amazon</b> has already begun to give us a taste of what’s in store. The online giant started its countdown to Black Friday with its Hidden Gems sale. With the official Black Friday deals set to run from 22 November until midnight on the official Black Friday date of 29 November, there are some early deals live right now to whet your appetite for some serious money saving. We imagine we’ll see some of the best sellers and top deals re-emerging after Black Friday too. Realistically, Amazon can’t be missing out on that all-important Cyber Monday date on 2 December, can it?</p>
      <p><b>eBay</b> is also angling for the “Can’t wait for Black Friday? Here’s a code!” approach with a 20% discount code now live and running until 21 November on selected eBay shops and products. As eBay is consistently the king of codes, we expect  a lot more to come in the run-up to Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Both <b>John Lewis &amp; Partners</b> and <b>Argos</b> are keeping us on the edge of our seats, but we sure they’ll be throwing their weight around sooner rather than later. Argos has a sign-up page if you’re keen to be the first to know when its Black Friday deals launch, while John Lewis is keeping pretty tight-lipped for now on what’s to come.</p>
