      <p>Nintendo is adding a pair of subscription plans to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/animal-crossing-pocket-camp/40236"><i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i></a> that will offer paying players two things: one is a helper who will play portions of the game for you, and the other is a monthly dose of loot boxes and increased item storage.</p>
      <p>The more expensive of those two options is the Cookie and Depot plan. It costs $7.99 per month and gives the player a choice of five Fortune Cookies, the game’s version of loot boxes. It lets players pick from cookies that aren’t around anymore, as well. Fortune Cookies normally cost 50 Leaf Tickets, the game’s premium currency, and gives a piece of furniture or clothing from a set theme. Players who use the Cookie and Depot plan will also get more space to hold all of their items.</p>

      <p>The Happy Helper plan is $2.99 per month and lets you pick one of your favorite villagers as a campsite helper. While you’re not playing the game, the helper will collect event items and help complete tasks, effectively playing the game while you’re away. Players will also get a stipend of 60 Leaf Tickets every month.</p>
      <p>Here’s a video that explains how The Happy Helper plan works:</p>

      <p>Both plans will also lower how long it takes to craft items, as well as give access to the Pocket Camp Club Journal, which seems like an in-game magazine that talks about the franchise’s characters. Both plans are available starting today, Nov. 20 at 10 p.m. PT.</p>
      <p><i>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</i>’s new subscription plans follow a similar monthly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/25/20883283/mario-kart-tour-gold-pass-features-price">subscription plan for <i>Mario Kart Tou</i>r</a>. While optional, players can pay $4.99 a month to unlock the 200cc racing options, as well as earn exclusive cosmetics with that game’s Gold Pass.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/31/20942068/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-2-years-later"><i>Pocket Camp</i> has turned into a grind</a>, requiring players to log in several times a day on a three-hour schedule in order to successfully complete the game’s events and obtain rare items, which is weird for a game franchise known for being about going at your own pace. The Happy Helper plan seems to have to purpose of aiding that.</p>
      <p>Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ACPocketCamp/comments/dyvwt6/799_per_month_are_you_f_kidding_me/">have been expressing concerns already</a> about the subscription plans. Most players don’t seem to mind the Happy Helper plan as an option for people who are too busy to keep up with the game’s grinding, but are outraged by the pricing of the Cookie and Depot plan.</p>
      <p>“Holy fuck. Google doesn’t even charge this much for storage,” says <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ACPocketCamp/comments/dyvwt6/799_per_month_are_you_f_kidding_me/f83vk8f/">Reddit user blackcurrantandapple</a>.</p>
      <p>At least <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/animal-crossing-new-horizons/40565"><i>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</i></a> for Nintendo Switch drops on March 20, so we don’t have long to wait for a better Animal Crossing title.</p>
