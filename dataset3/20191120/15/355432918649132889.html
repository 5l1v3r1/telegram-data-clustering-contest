      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:53:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Miramar, Fla., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/wayne-messam">Wayne Messam</a> announced Wednesday that he was suspending his 2020 Democratic presidential campaign. </p>
      <p>"Although the campaign goal of becoming President was not realized at this moment, I could not be more thankful for the many supporters including my family, friends and so many Americans I have had the awesome opportunity to meet on the campaign trail all over this nation," Messam said in a Medium post. </p>

      <p>Messam also said he would "continue to be engaged" in the election cycle to "ensure that we defeat <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a>."</p>
      <p>"I intend to be a factor to mobilize our state for the Democratic Party Nominee. The stakes are too high and the American people cannot afford four more years of tyranny and disrespect of our Constitution," he said.</p>
      <p>The mayor failed to make a significant impression in the polls and did not appear in any of the Democratic debates.</p>
      <p>Messam did not appear to be seriously campaigning in recent months and went without an active campaign <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;view_all_page_id=100157833650312">Facebook ad</a> since August.</p>
      <p>His campaign initially reported <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/465916-messam-raised-5-this-quarter-for-presidential-run">raising just $5</a> and spending no money in the third quarter of 2019. In an amended filing, his campaign said it raised approximately $15,000 and spent roughly $11,000 in the three-month period.</p>
      <p>Messam noted in the post on Wednesday that he was the first candidate to call for complete student loan debt forgiveness.</p>
      <p>He added that he would continue to serve Miramar as its mayor.</p>
      <p>"There are many rumors concerning my next steps in service and they are just that, rumors. I will continue to serve our great City of Miramar, Broward County, the State of Florida and these United States of America," he said.</p>
