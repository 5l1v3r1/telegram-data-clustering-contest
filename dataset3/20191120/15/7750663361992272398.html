      <h1>James Maddison to snub Manchester United for new Leicester City deal?</h1>
      <h2>England midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-maddison/"><b>James Maddison</b></a> could reportedly turn down a move to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> in order to sign a new contract with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leicester-city/"><b>Leicester City</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 22-year-old, who has scored six times in 13 appearances for the Foxes this season, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-confident-of-signing-james-maddison_375948.html">is believed</a> to a leading transfer target for United.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>, Maddison could snub a switch to Old Trafford in favour of signing a new deal with Leicester.</p>
      <p>The former Coventry City youngster made his England debut during their <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/england/euro-2020/result/result-harry-kane-hits-hat-trick-as-england-score-seven-in-1000th-game_378955.html">7-0 win</a> over Montenegro last week.</p>
      <p>United are thought to view Maddison as the perfect player to fill their number 10 spot with the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jesse-lingard/"><b>Jesse Lingard</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/juan-mata/"><b>Juan Mata</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andreas-pereira/"><b>Andreas Pereira</b></a> struggling to impress in that area of the field this season.</p>
      <p>The attacker's current deal at the King Power Stadium will run until the summer of 2023.</p>
