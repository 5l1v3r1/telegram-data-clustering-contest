      <p>On the Nov. 19 reset for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/destiny-2/39651"><i>Destiny 2</i></a>, Bungie finally made good on the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/9/20907003/destiny-2-tower-construction-vex-gate-ikora-shadowkeep-season-undying">mysterious portal in the Tower</a> social space. After a month of waiting, players traveled into the seasonal Vex Offensive activity to face an old foe from the original <i>Destiny</i>: the Undying Mind. But, as the final batch of content on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/16/20864542/destiny-2-shadowkeep-schedule-exotic-quest-weapon-changes-patch-notes-new-light-buffs-nerfs-preview">this season’s calendar</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dynd8h/welp_undying_mind_is_underwhelming/">players are disappointed</a> with the execution.</p>
      <p>The Vex Offensive is Season of the Undying’s main seasonal activity. Players fight through three different areas, killing loads of Vex enemies and, eventually, a boss. Before Nov. 19, the boss was a giant Vex Minotaur. But since what Bungie’s calling the Final Assault started, the boss is now the Undying Mind. Unfortunately, the fight is the exact same as before — just with an update to how the bosses look, as well as a very cool summoning animation.</p>
      <p>Players haven’t had any new content in <i>Destiny 2</i> for a few weeks now. And while there’s always a lull between seasons, the inclusion of the Final Assault on the Season of the Undying roadmap got fans excited for something a bit newer than they ultimately received.</p>

      <p>Most of the player frustration around the Final Assault seems to focus on two things: built up expectations, and no exclusive loot. Some players are even claiming the boss is a re-skin of an old enemy, due to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/dyvgee/getting_killed_by_harpies_says_youve_been_killed/">visual bug that attributes death</a> to a different, very similar looking boss from last season — adding to community frustration.</p>
      <p>From a story perspective, the return of the Undying Mind is a pretty big deal — and will likely lead into the next season of content. The Vex enemies are trying to undo some of the work Guardians did way back in the original <i>Destiny</i>. Stuff that, if undone, could have dire consequences for the Guardians in the world of Destiny. But as a RPG MMO, players often need more than a cool story moment to get them excited.</p>
      <p>The Vex Offensive Final Assault is the last thing on <i>Destiny 2</i>’s roadmap for the Season of the Undying. And while it’s possible the studio could be hiding something for the final days, Destiny players will likely need to wait until Dec. 10 for the next content drop.</p>
