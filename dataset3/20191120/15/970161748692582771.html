      <p>Even though <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a>: Endgame came out in April, fans are still coming up with ideas around the various characters, themes and outcomes.</p>
      <p>We just can’t help ourselves, can we?</p>
      <p>Now one excited viewer has come up with the now-viral theory Tony Stark’s (Robert Downey Jr) young daughter Morgan (Lexi Rabe) was a robot all along.</p>
      <p>We don’t love this theory 3000.</p>
      <p>Twitter user @sisabet shared a message she got from her sister, who had some rather interesting thoughts about Tony’s daughter with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow).</p>
      <p>‘I totally thought Tony made a robot daughter the whole damn movie,’ a screenshot of the text message read.</p>

      <p>‘I thought for sure in the beginning especially because pepper didn’t have anything to do with her.</p>

      <p>‘And then when she said I love you 3000, I thought ha ha she’s the ILU 3000 that’s her model. [sic]’</p>
      <p>That’s right, she thought 3000 was her make.</p>

      <p>They continued: ‘And when Tony said the captain and Nat, I have to be careful I have a daughter and they look down all sad, I thought they were sad because Tony Stark has lost his goddamn mind and believes his robot daughter is real.’</p>
      <p>Sheesh, this is quite the call, right?</p>
      <p>While it sounds quite crazy a thought to believe Morgan Stark was a robot, what with her proclivity for a delicious cheeseburgers and what not, other fans are totally feeling the thing now the idea has been introduced.</p>
      <p>One fan commented: ‘I totally agree with her. Tony spent 10 years being a selfish tool and suddenly he is Family Man Tony Thoreau? No. Secret armor in the garage and obvious robo daughter. Then they martyr the guy too? The directors are fans of narcissists.’</p>
      <p>Another picked up on the Pepper theory, as they added: ‘I thought the relationship of pepper and the daughter was always strange. I just assumed bad acting ha. But it was always like that’s not her real daughter, that’s a child from a previous affair.’</p>

      <p>And everyone else was laughing.</p>
      <p>Look, it’s hardly the weirdest theory we’ve come across – that award must go to the Ant-Man, Thanos butt theory.</p>
