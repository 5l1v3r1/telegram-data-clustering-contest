      <h2>An inquest heard how the body of Robert Philip Longcake was identified by his wife Andrea after he was 'suspended by his ankle' on Dixon's chimney in Carlisle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:48:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, Barnaby Kellaway</a></address>
      <p>A "fantastic granddad" found dangling upside down from the top of a 300ft chimney died from hypothermia and brain swelling, an inquest heard today.</p>
      <p>The hearing into the death of 53-year-old <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-first-picture-man-who-20755537">Robert Philip Longcake</a> was told he spent 15 hours trapped at the top of the Dixon's chimney in Carlisle and was "suspended by his ankle".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/carlisle-chimney-death-tragic-dads-20765051">Mr Longcake was described as a "fantastic granddad"</a> and "a strong, brave man who achieved a lot in his short life" by his family shortly after his death on October 28.</p>
      <p>The inquest was opened and adjourned this morning in Cockermouth by Cumbria area coroner Kirsty Gomersal.</p>
      <p>It heard how the family man from Carlisle became stranded on top of the tower in the early hours and died before emergency services were able to rescue him.</p>

      <p>His body was eventually brought to ground at 4.30pm the same day by rope rescue specialists, who used a 300ft cherry picker to get to the top of the chimney.</p>
      <p>A post-mortem, conducted three weeks ago, concluded the council worker's cause of death to be "hypothermia and cerebral swelling" and "inverted suspension".</p>
      <p>The coroner said: "The details of Mr Longcake's death are that he was found suspended by his ankle on Dixon's chimney, Shaddongate, Carlisle.</p>
      <p>"After a lengthy recovery operation, Mr Longcake was sadly declared deceased at the scene."</p>

      <p>During the brief hearing, it emerged Mr Longcake's body was formally identified by his wife Andrea.</p>
      <p>No family members were at the inquest, which was adjourned until March 23, 2020.</p>
      <h3>Historic trauma</h3>
      <p>In a tribute released after Mr Longcake's death, his family said he was suffering from "historic trauma".</p>
      <p>It read: "Sadly, due to recent disclosures he made about historic trauma he suffered, Phil was battling with his mental health, with the love and support of his family and health professionals whilst trying to overcome this."</p>
      <p>The family said he was a keen motorcyclist and would often spend weekends away with his son, Robert.</p>

      <p>In a statement on a <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/rob-laura-longcake?utm_campaign=pfp-share&amp;utm_content=Rob-Laura-Longcake">JustGiving</a> page, his daughter-in-law Sarah Longcake said: "In light of recent events there has been an outpouring of love and support from friends, family and complete strangers which has been comforting to the family at this tragic time.</p>
      <p>"We would like to try and make something positive come out of this and shine a light on mental health as it can affect anyone, it does not discriminate and nobody should have to go through something so heartbreaking."</p>

      <p>Mr Longcake is also survived by his daughter Laura and her partner Darren, his father Bill and his brother John, the family said.</p>
      <h3>A desperate rescue attempt</h3>
      <p>As previously reported, witnesses looked on in horror as rescuers tried to save Mr Longcake.</p>
      <p>Officials said at the time there was no safe way to bring him down quickly while he was still alive.</p>
      <p>Mr Longcake eventually became unresponsive and was confirmed dead hours later when his body was removed from the chimney.</p>
      <p>Cumbria Police have launched an investigation into why he climbed up the Grade II-listed structure.</p>
      <p>Carlisle City Council claimed he climbed temporary metal ladders put in place for maintenance work within a walled and gated compound.</p>

      <p>The lowest point of the ladders was 15ft above the ground.</p>
      <p>Police were first alerted at about 2.20am amid reports that shouts and wailing could be heard. Mr Longcake was hanging from the chimney in cold <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> .</p>
      <p>His left leg was trapped between brickwork and a ladder, it was previously reported.</p>
      <p>A Coastguard helicopter hovered over the structure but the attempt to rescue Mr Longcake was abandoned due to safety concerns.</p>
      <p>After a public appeal from police, a specialist cherry picker big enough to reach the top of the structure, which is attached to an old mill, was brought in was brought in from Glasgow - about 100 miles away - during a huge rescue operation.</p>
      <p>Rescuers were using drones to assess the scene. Volunteers from Penrith Mountain Rescue Team were also on hand.</p>
      <p>Police and fire officials later said attempts to rescue Mr Longcake using a helicopter were not possible "due to the precarious position" he was in and the potential for the downdraft to knock him loose.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>John Walkden, of Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service, said firefighters could not just climb the ladder like Mr Longcake had done.</p>
      <p>He said: "This was nearly 300ft in the air, with poor and unsafe access.</p>
      <p>"We had some professional steeplejacks on scene who had been there since the early hours.</p>
      <p>"They had previously worked on the chimney and their assessment was that if anyone tried to ascend the ladder, it could effectively have dislodged the man who was trapped at the top."</p>
      <p>Stuart Hook, the station manager who led the operation, said the ladder was unstable and firefighters tried to reassure Mr Longcake that they were working on a plan to get him down.</p>
      <p>He said: "The whole top section of the ladder was not fully fixed in place.”</p>
      <p>There were fears firefighters could be killed if they climbed the ladder and Mr Longcake fell and crashed into them.</p>
      <p>Mr Hook said the helicopter was the man's best chance of survival but it was ruled out because it was too dangerous.</p>
      <p>He added: “The crew said - with 100 per cent certainty - he’d fall (due to the downdraft) if they tried to get him.</p>
      <p>"It was very frustrating. Unfortunately, there was no way we could get this gentleman down quickly and safely.”</p>
