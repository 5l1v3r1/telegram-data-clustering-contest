      <h1>Sana Mir to take break from international cricket</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan women's team star player Sana Mir on Wednesday announced she will be taking an indefinite break from international cricket to reset her "future objectives and targets".</p>
      <p>Former captain Mir, who has represented Pakistan in 120 ODIs and 106 T20s, however, did not specify how long she intends to be away from the game.</p>
      <p>"I have decided to take a break from international cricket and, as such, will not be available for selection for next month's series against England. I will utilize this time to plan and reset my future objectives and targets," Mir said in a media release.</p>
      <p>"My best wishes will remain with the Pakistan national women's team in the series against England and I am sure they'll produce their best cricket."</p>
      <p>Because of the break, the 33-year-old will miss next month's ICC Women's Championship ODIs and T20Is against England.</p>
      <p>The 20-probable training camp for the ODIs and T20I series will commence at the Hanif Mohammad High-Performance Centre in Karachi from November 21, while the squads will be announced on 27 November.</p>
      <p>The team will depart for Kuala Lumpur on November 30.</p>
      <p>Pakistan is placed fifth on the ICC Women's Championship table with 15 points from seven games.Â </p>
