      <h1>Free of ‘political bulls—t’ in UFC, ‘happy’ Luke Rockhold doesn’t foresee return to MMA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:40:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>I know a lot of mixed martial arts (MMA) fans get frustrated when their favorite fighters, like former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) women’s bantamweight champion, Ronda Rousey, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/1/29/16945026/did-ronda-rousey-retire-ufc-rowdy-answers-worst-way-possible-mma">refuse to take a definitive stance on retiring</a>. But I much prefer an indecisive take than a fighter who retires with a ton of fanfare — only to come back a short time later <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/5/15/18624672/urijah-faber-teases-ufc-comeback-sacramento-because-diapers-expensive-mma">because bills have to be paid</a> or egos have to be fed.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Luke Rockhold, he’s both financially secure and emotionally content after more than a decade in combat sports, which produced middleweight titles in both Strikeforce and UFC. While the <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2014/11/5/7157481/ufc-fight-night-55-luke-rockhold-details-near-drowning-surfing-incident-mma">part-time surfer</a> struggled in the latter half of his career, including a <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/11/20960047/heres-that-video-of-jan-blachowicz-flatlining-luke-rockhold-ahead-ufc-sao-paulo-return-mma">failed trip up to light heavyweight</a>, the future remains bright outside of fighting.</p>
      <p>“Fighting takes a lot. I’ve done it, I’ve been to the top of the game. I just don’t have the same passion, the hunger for it at this point,” Rockhold told <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/20/20973765/luke-rockhold-right-now-im-just-happy-not-fighting">MMA Fighting</a>. “I’m excited to go in other realms of life. I know I have a lot of fans out there. I’m sorry I’m not fighting but you never know. Maybe someday I will but I don’t foresee it at this point.”</p>
      <p>Rockhold, who ended half of his MMA wins by way of submission — seven of them in the first round — will make his return to the grappling mats on Sat., Nov. 30, 2019 in Newport, Wales, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/13/20963648/polaris-luke-rockhold-vs-nick-rodriguez-main-event-set-nov-30-newport-mma">in the Polaris 12 main event</a> opposite jiu-jitsu wunderkind Nick Rodriguez.</p>
      <p>“Obviously you can’t fight forever,” Rockhold said. “I can make more money outside the cage so if I can do that, why not? Not have to deal with the political bullshit that comes with fighting and the UFC, all that stuff we know about. I like it. It makes me happy.”</p>
      <p>I’m sure it makes <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/5/16/15648946/luke-rockhold-shuts-down-ufc-president-dana-white-twitter-think-before-you-run-your-mouth-mma">this guy</a> happy too.</p>
