      <h1>Big changes are coming to Underhill Park in Mumbles</h1>
      <h2>Planning permission has been granted for the first phase of work at the well-used park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:31:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Nino Williams</a></address>
      <p>Plans to transform sporting facilities in Mumbles have moved a step closer after planning permission was finally granted for the multi-million project.</p>
      <p>The proposals for Underhill Park include replacing the existing tired-looking changing rooms with modern changing facilities, and creating a dedicated community space with a café and new public toilets.</p>
      <p>It would also include the development of a new all weather pitch with floodlighting.</p>
      <p>The first phase would cost some £2.25m if delivered in full.</p>
      <p>The volunteer-led group behind the proposals, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/mumbles">Mumbles</a> Community Association, submitted a planning application to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> Council for phase one of the Go Underhill development in July, which has now been granted formal approval.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the MCA trustees, Simon Tse, said: “Obtaining planning permission for phase 1 of the project is a significant step forward for Go Underhill. It is the last piece of the jigsaw we’ve needed to complete in order to secure the future of Underhill Park for the community of Mumbles and the surrounding areas, as well as the many visitors.</p>
      <p>“I would like to thank everyone that has helped in getting us to this point.”</p>
      <p>With planning permission in place, the Go Underhill team will now look to raising funds for the development, to complement grant bids and funding applications to agencies which have already being made. They intend to announce schemes and events to raise funds early in 2020.</p>

      <p>The Go Underhill plans will also benefit those who already use the park for formal and informal sports activities, and families visiting the children’s play area.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Friends of Mumbles Parks, who were responsible for the recent upgrade of the children’s play area, said: “We are delighted to hear that MCA have been successful with their planning application.</p>
      <p>“As the refurbishment of the playground has demonstrated, Underhill Park is an extremely valued and well-loved community resource.</p>
      <p>“The new playground attracts so many families from all over the area and beyond. It is time for the rest of the park to receive the care and investment it most definitely deserves.”</p>

      <h3>Sports clubs back plans for Underhill Park</h3>
      <p>The plans are supported by two of the clubs that get the most use from the park.</p>
      <p>Simon Evans, chairman of Mumbles Rugby Club, said: “We are delighted to learn that MCA, which the rugby club are part of, have been awarded planning permission for Phase 1 of the Go Underhill project.</p>
      <p>"We are confident that funding will soon be in place which will enable work to start on this much needed facility.”</p>
      <p>And Michael Parkin, chairman of Mumbles Rangers Football Club, added: "It is an exciting time for all the community and extremely important that we will have these facilities for our members and visitors to Underhill Park.</p>
      <p>"It is essential for the football club that the new buildings and the all-weather pitch are built at the same time.</p>
      <p>"The all-weather pitch being available for all the community will in particular help develop our club in so many ways.</p>
      <p>"We now need to actively engage with all to raise funds and build these desperately needed facilities in Underhill Park and look forward to the works commencing.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The planning approval contained a number of conditions to address some concerns raised during the planning process.</p>
      <p>They include a 9pm limit on the time the all weather pitch can be used, which is when floodlights must also be switched off.</p>
      <p>The community facility and cafe will not open beyond 11pm most nights, and 10.30pm on Sundays.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Mumbles Community Council said they would do whatever they could to support the plans.</p>
      <p>And Simon Tse added: “As we now move into the fundraising activity, I would encourage everyone to show their support, no matter how big or small, and help us reach our financial goal. This will enable us to deliver the scheme that Underhill Park so desperately needs.”</p>
