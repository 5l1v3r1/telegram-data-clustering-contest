      <p>A MAYO Oireachtas member said it is very disappointing 3,247 bed days have been lost at Mayo University Hospital since January 1, 2019.</p>
      <p>Figures revealed to Fianna Fáil show 197,160 bed days have been lost for the first ten months of the year nationwide.</p>
      <p>Deputy Dara Calleary commented: “Until the government get serious on delivering home care supports we are going to see a rise in bed days lost.</p>
      <p>"Since the start of this year we have lost 3247 bed days in Mayo University Hospital. This is a common trend in the west. In Galway 6,412 bed days were lost.</p>
      <p>“These are people in hospital, who do not need to be there and do not want to be there, but the required step down services are not in place to support their discharge from hospital.</p>
      <p>“As well as the mental health and physical health detriments to the patient there are knock on consequences for other services in the hospital which become stretched.</p>
      <p>“What we need is more home support hours, home care packages and respite support for families.</p>
      <p>"It is only once these measures are in place that we will see an easing of the delayed discharge numbers."</p>
