      <h1>OPay sets lofty Africa goal after bagging $120M</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:38:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#chrisdonkin" target="_blank">Chris Donkin</a></address>
      <p>The CEO of Nigeria-focused mobile wallet, ride sharing and food delivery app OPay targeted creation of the best fintech ecosystem Africa has ever seen, after securing $120 million in funding.</p>
      <p>In a statement, OPay boss Yahui Zhou said the company would become a “key contributor to expanding financial inclusion in Africa … helping local businesses and workforces to thrive from opportunities created by new, digital business models.”</p>
      <p>He added the new cash would be allocated to operations in countries with supporting regulation, citing opportunities in its existing market of Nigeria alongside Ghana, South Africa and Kenya.</p>
      <p>The company launched its mobile payment service in August 2018 and has since added a number of other consumer-facing products. Its latest cash injection comes less than five months after <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/opay-targets-new-africa-markets-after-50m-funding/">netting $50 million</a> from investors.</p>
      <p>Its latest backers include a SoftBank-run investment fund, DragonBall Capital, GaoRong Capital, Source Code Capital and IDG Capital.</p>
