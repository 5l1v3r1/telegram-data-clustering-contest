      <p>Before you start looking for debt consolidation loans, it is important for you to understand the intricacies of these loans and how you can use them to eliminate your existing loans.</p>
      <p>As far as getting out of debt is concerned, your high-interest rate is one of the biggest obstacles. Unfortunately, the high-interest rate is also responsible for some of the most common causes for people to get into debt.</p>
      <p>Debt consolidation refers to taking out another loan for paying off all the existing debts. With a lower average interest rate compared to the existing debt, it consolidates all existing loans into one. These loans can also provide us more time for paying back the debt and reduce the amount that needs to be paid each month.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the best part about a debt consolidation loan is that a higher amount is spent on paying down the debt, and a much lesser amount is paid as interest. This means that the overall balance gets reduced at a brisk rate.</p>
