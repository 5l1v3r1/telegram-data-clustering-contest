        <b>Shocking, Huroyi 101 as a tree grows out of a car in France?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chances are, you may have already seen a viral video and pictures on social media in what appears to be an uncommon scene. In France, a tree mysteriously grew out of a car on the side of the road.</p>

      <p>To a local, and probably a child, there can only be one explanation to it; Huroyi and nothing else.</p>
      <p>A lot of superstitious conspiracies have already come out from a local African point of view; the European folk has adopted juju. Or it may be a case where witchcraft was done to a prospering African kid in Europe by a jealous neighbor back in Africa.</p>
      <p>But to regular folk, all that is impossible. Turns out this is, in fact, a piece of art put up by a local theatre group called The Royal De Luxe, popularly known for impromptu pieces of art that defy logic like this one- <a href="https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/nantes-44000/culture-nantes-royal-de-luxe-vient-habiter-bellevue-6101837">as reported by Ouest-France.</a></p>
      <aside>“The street theatre company led by Jean-Luc Courcoult settles in this neighborhood straddling Nantes and Saint-Herblain, in full urban renewal”</aside>
      <p>Not much information has been reported on how such an enormous act was pulled through; but well, there can only be two logical explanations to it.</p>
      <p>The bottom and top of the car are already pre-pierced from the side. Tow cuts were probably made just big enough for a tree to slide through, and the cuts hidden by a rubber roof sill on top and further hidden by the closed door.</p>
      <p>Or, the tree just wasn’t there. A hole was pierced through on the car and a tree (artificial or natural) was cut out somewhere and later dug through a stationed car.</p>
      <p>Hats off to the artists for the ingenious piece of art!</p>
