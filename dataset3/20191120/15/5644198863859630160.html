      <p>The court heard that on the morning of Oct 14, 2018, Ong noticed that a car parked in the basement of The Rise@Oxley condominium was unlocked. </p>
      <p>Ong, who was working as a security guard at the condo along Oxley Rise, then opened the car door and took the cash card out from the in-vehicle unit.  </p>
      <p>The same day, Ong transferred the cash value of S$192.47 from the stolen cash card into his personal bank account.  </p>
      <p>Ong has since made restitution of S$200 to the car owner.  </p>
      <p>The following year on Jul 11, Ong stole four bottles of Tongkat Ali bottles valued at S$128 each from Overseas Emporium, a departmental store inside People’s Park Complex.  </p>
      <p>He repeated the act again on Jul 24. His actions were captured on closed-circuit television cameras at the shop on both occasions.</p>
      <p>Ong was arrested on Jul 25.  </p>
      <p>Four bottles of the Tongkat Ali medicine were seized, but the bottles’ seals had been compromised.  </p>
      <p>The total value across all charges was S$1916.36.  </p>
      <p>For theft in dwelling, Ong could have been jailed for up to seven years, and liable to a fine, while for each charge of theft, Ong could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, or both. </p>
