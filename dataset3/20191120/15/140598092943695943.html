      <h1>Hitler's birthplace to become police station</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:25:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/justin-huggler/" target="_blank">Justin Huggler</a></address>
      <p>Adolf Hitler’s birthplace is to be turned into a police station to prevent it becoming a shrine for neo-Nazis.</p>
      <p>Austria has spent years debating what to do with the 17th century house in Braunau am Inn, a small town near Linz, where the future Fuhrer was born in 1889.</p>
      <p>There were calls for the building to be levelled after the Austrian government seized it by compulsory purchase in 2017.</p>
      <p>Instead the Austrian interior ministry has announced plans to redevelop it as a district police headquarters.</p>
      <p>“The future use of the house by the police should set an unmistakable sign that this building is permanently removed from the memory of National Socialism,”  Wolfgang Peschorn, the Austrian interior minister, said.</p>
      <p>The Austrian government will hold an EU-wide architectural competition to determine the design, he said.</p>

      <p>Hitler was born on April 20, 1889 in the building, but only lived there a few weeks before his family moved.</p>
      <p>There have long been concerns in Austria that the house was becoming a piligrimage site for neo-Nazis.</p>
      <p>The Austrian government rented the building from its former owner for more than 40 years to prevent it becoming a shrine.</p>
      <p>It was used as a daycare centre for people with learning difficulties until 2011, when the charity involved moved out after a dispute with the owner over wheelchair access.</p>
      <p>The former owner also blocked moves to mount a plaque honouring the victims of the Nazis, prompting the local authorities to install a memorial on the pavement instead.</p>
      <p>The government expropriated the building in 2017. Rather than relying on Austria’s standard compulsory purchase legislation, the it passed a special law to prevent setting a precedent of seizing property for political reasons.</p>
