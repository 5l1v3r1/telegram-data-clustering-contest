      <p>Two more businesses are leaving downtown Kelowna's embattled Leon Avenue.</p>
      <p>As a tent city on the 200 block continues to grow, Boyds Tire and Auto Service and Eco-Clean are getting out.</p>
      <p>After eight years of business on the corner of Leon Avenue and Water Street, Chad Abougoush at Boyds believes he has no other option than to relocate.</p>
      <p>"I had to make this decision ... we've expressed years in advance that there (are) issues down here and that we needed to do something – and nothing has been done," said Abougoush.</p>
      <p>Abougoush met with city council, as well as RCMP, a year and a half ago to discuss homelessness and crime in the area, but nothing further was done.</p>
      <p>"We tried to make a plan, and we opened up our efforts and our timeline to use any resources we had to try and help make the situation better, and it just fell upon deaf ears," said Abougoush.</p>
      <p>Despite this, he says RCMP and the Downtown Kelowna Association have been helpful.</p>
      <p>"The police that have been downtown have been super helpful ... their hands are tied somewhat, too," said Abougoush. "The Downtown Kelowna Association has been a big part of us being able to still try and operate down here."</p>
      <p>The decision to move comes from concerns over customers' safety.</p>
      <p>"My customers mean everything to me," said Abougoush. "They come to me and trust me and they give me their vehicle, and I take that very seriously. So in order to do that, I have to provide a clean, safe environment for them to come to, and that is no longer available here."</p>
      <p>He has encountered sidewalks as washrooms and harassment over loose change.</p>
      <p>"The more entitlement that comes from them growing and becoming a bigger thing, it seems like they're more comfortable pushing the boundaries," said Abougoush. "I'm certain that once I'm gone, the problem will grow further down Leon and it'll be a worse problem for them to deal with."</p>
      <p>His shop will move into a new location in the spring on Clement Avenue.</p>
