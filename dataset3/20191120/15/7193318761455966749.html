      <p>Checotah native Carrie Underwood has got the blues in newly released music video for her latest single, "Drinking Alone."</p>
      <p>The mini-movie, directed by her frequent collaborator Randee St. Nicholas, <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5647109/photos-and-video-carrie-underwood-delivers-smoldering-performance-of-drinking-alone-on-cma-awards">as previously reported</a>, debuted today. It features Underwood as a brokenhearted blues club chanteuse who has a significant encounter with a similarly lonely-hearted patron.</p>
