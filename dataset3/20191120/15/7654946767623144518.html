      <h1>Tiny, ‘New York City-sized’ Cracker Barrel rolls into Manhattan for Thanksgiving</h1>

      <p>Cracker Barrel, America’s favorite country-fried stop along the interstate, is celebrating a big milestone with a little country store in NYC, ahead of the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>
      <p>The Lebanon, Tenn.-based restaurant chain — known for antique-covered walls, peg games and biscuits — is honoring its 50th anniversary with a 269-square-foot, “New York City-sized” Cracker Barrel store that will appear in the holiday parade, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/cracker-barrel-tiny-new-york-thanksgiving-day-parade">according to Fox News.</a></p>
      <p>The functioning “Tiny Home Away from Home” will feature Southern fixin’s like a front porch, rocking chairs, a glowing fireplace and even reclaimed wood from the first Cracker Barrel store, which debuted in Tennessee on Sept. 19, 1969. The day before the parade, the mini-Barrel will set up shop in NYC’s Foley Square for city folk to check out.</p>
      <p>“As we celebrate our golden anniversary, this is a big moment for Cracker Barrel, and we wanted to do something extra special to mark our first-ever appearance in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade by creating a miniature Cracker Barrel experience that recalls the unique atmosphere of hospitality enjoyed by guests,” Cracker Barrel Vice President of Marketing Jeff Sigel said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Alas, Cracker Barrel does not actually have a location in New York, so fans will want to take the opportunity to stop by the little ol’ country store to pick up vintage toys, as well as packaged foods.</p>
