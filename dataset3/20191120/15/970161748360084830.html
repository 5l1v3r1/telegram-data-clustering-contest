      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lil-nas-x/">Lil Nas X</a> has had one heck of a year, and is now wrapping up with decade with six whole Grammy nominations.</p>
      <p>It seems he’s just excited as we are over the news as he celebrated with his fans on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement, which saw him tie with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a>, while <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a> earned eight nods, the 20-year-old was quick to take to his social media platforms.</p>
      <p>With barely any explanation to his outburst, the singer (whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill), wrote: ‘NO F**KING WAY.’</p>
      <p>And yes, the capitals are more than necessary.</p>

      <p>He joins the likes of Lizzo who is steaming ahead of the competition with an impressive eight nominations to her name including album of the year for Cuz I Love You, best new artist and song of the year for Truth Hurts.</p>
      <p>Lewis Capaldi has also received a nomination for song of the year with Someone You Loved.</p>
      <p>Alicia Keys helped do the honours of announcing the list of nominations, on Wednesday, as she’s set to host the awards for the second year in a row at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on 27 January.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old revealed she would be presenting the prestigious ceremony earlier this year in a statement.</p>
      <p>Here she said: ‘At first I did think last year was a one-time thing but when the opportunity came back around there was no question about returning as host of the GRAMMY Awards.</p>
      <p>‘Last year was such a powerful experience for me. Not only did I feel the love in the room, but I felt it from around the world and it confirmed the healing and unifying power of music.’</p>
