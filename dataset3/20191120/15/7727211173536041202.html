      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:54:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Rebekah Vardy has shared photos from her surprise baby shower, as she prepares to welcome her fifth child.</p>
      <p>Rebekah's sister Esther threw the surprise shower for the 37-year-old, who has had a tough couple of months after her feud with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/coleen-rooney-says-its-been-17224719">Coleen Rooney.</a></p>
      <p>Dressed in a cream jumper dress with her brown hair down Rebekah held balloons with the slogan "Oh Baby" emblazoned on them.</p>

      <p>She then shared photos of some of the gifts she had received, along with photos of some of her friends who had attended the shower.</p>
      <p>Rebekah captioned the photos: "Such an amazing surprise... thank you to my amazing Sister ❤️❤️ love you all."</p>
      <p>Her husband Jamie Vardy said: "You deserve it."</p>
      <p>And fellow WAG Nicola McLean, who was vocal in her support for Rebekah during <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/showbiz-news/coleen-wayne-rooney-pay-sweet-17190751">the Coleen drama,</a> sent a series of love heart emojis to her.</p>
      <p>Last month <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/rebekah-vardy-appears-mock-coleen-17150788">Coleen caused a media storm</a> when she accused someone operating Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account of selling stories about her to The S*n newspaper.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/rebekah-vardy-appears-mock-coleen-17150788">Rebekah categorically denied</a> the claims and said her account had been previously hacked.</p>
      <p>The fallout caused a series of viral memes and tweets, with the hashtag #Wagathachristie trending widely.</p>
