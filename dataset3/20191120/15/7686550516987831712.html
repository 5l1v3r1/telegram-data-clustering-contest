      <p>Take the stress out of cooking this Christmas day with a special five-course feast at Mowgli’s Whitchurch restaurant.</p>
      <p>Established in 2009 with a restaurant on Crwys Road, Mowgli's was created by food-loving enthusiast Mr Zaman, who has over 30 years of experience in catering business with special interest in Indian cuisine.</p>
      <p>It has since then added a second restaurant in Whitchurch in 2018 which is open on Christmas day for the first time. Enjoy a five-course special Christmas meal - vegetarian option is available on request - from as little as £29.95 per person and can be booked from any time between 12-9pm.</p>

      <p>During its 10 years in operation, Mowgli's has carved out a reputation of delivering high-class traditional Indian fine-dining cuisine at both of its restaurants. It has also picked up a plethora of awards along the way too.</p>
      <p>Dining at Mowgli's on Christmas day requires advance booking notice.</p>
      <p>Mowgli's looks forward to spreading a little Christmas cheer over the festive period and would like to thank the people of South Wales for their custom over the years.</p>
