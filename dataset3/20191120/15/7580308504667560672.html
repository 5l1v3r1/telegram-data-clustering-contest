      <p>Lagos State Government on Wednesday blamed the persistent traffic in different parts of the state on the influx of people from different parts of the country.</p>
      <p>“The daily influx of people from other parts of the country into Lagos has contributed to the big human and vehicular pressure on the roads,” Lagos information and strategy commissioner Gbenga Omotoso said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The government will surely surmount the challenges with technology and enforcement of traffic rules.”</p>
      <p>The government spokesman said the state has noted the discomfort commuters and motorists have been experiencing since the beginning of the road repairs under ‘Operation 116’ across Lagos State.</p>
      <p>Omotoso said the traffic is not a deliberate action to cause Lagosians any pain, the present situation is temporary.</p>
      <p>He stated that the contractors working on road constructions are being encouraged to work at night to speed up their works.</p>
      <p>The commissioner said the government sympathises with residents on the inconvenience suffered daily.</p>
      <p>He assured Lagosians that the discomfort will be short-lived as the government will make “the roads motorable immediately the rains subside, resources and equipment have been deployed to fix degenerated roads.”</p>
      <p>Consequently, he said the government has directed the relevant agencies to review traffic control and regulation policies towards identifying a long-lasting remedy to the problem.</p>
      <p>“The administration will ensure that majority of the roads become smooth and motorable before the Yuletide,” Omotoso said.</p>
