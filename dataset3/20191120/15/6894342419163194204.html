      <h1>Xiaomi Mi Note 10 and Note 10 Pro Officially Coming To Malaysia This December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:45:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/chapree/" target="_blank">Chief Chapree</a></address>
      <p>In a rather interesting move by the company, <b>Xiaomi</b> has officially confirmed that its new <b>Mi Note 10</b> and <b>Mi Note 10 Pro</b> will be heading to Malaysia soon. While that might sound rather ordinary, take a closer look at the picture above.</p>
      <p>Instead of the usual press note or Facebook and Twitter teasers, Xiaomi decided to confirm the arrival of new Mi Note 10 series in Malaysia via the gigantic display at Pavilion Kuala Lumpur. We only noticed its existence through <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xiaomi.malaysia/">Xiaomi Malaysia’s Instagram story a few hours ago</a>.</p>

      <p>In general, <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/197501/xiaomi-mi-note-10-108mp-penta-camera-setup/">the Mi Note 10 is the international variant</a> of <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198032/mi-cc9-pro-goes-official-in-china-price-starts-from-2799-yuan/">Mi CC9 Pro that the company has released in China</a> while the Mi Note 10 Pro was known as the Mi CC9 Pro Premium Edition over there. The main highlight of both devices is definitely <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/191472/samsung-xiaomi-isocell-bright-hmx-sensor/">their Samsung-made 108MP main camera</a> and interesting enough, DxOMark has awarded the Mi CC9 Pro Premium with <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/198111/xiaomi-mi-cc9-pro-scores-121-points-on-dxomark-on-par-with-huawei-mate-30-pro/">the same score as per Huawei Mate 30 Pro</a>.</p>
      <p>As for other components, the Mi Note 10 series is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor and offers up to 6GB RAM as well as 128GB internal storage<a href="https://www.mi.com/global/mi-note-10/specs"> according to Xiaomi’s official global website</a>. In China, the Mi CC9 Pro series is available with <a href="https://item.mi.com/product/10000198.html">up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB storage</a>.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the short advert at Pavilion KL’s gigantic screen not only confirmed Mi Note 10 and Mi Note 10 Pro for our market but has also included their Malaysian launch date: 3 December 2019. Hence, do stay tuned for more information about both phones in just a few weeks time.</p>
