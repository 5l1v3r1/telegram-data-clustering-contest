      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>RIYADH —</b> Educating the public about Respiratory Syncytial Virus is vital, claims a leading consultant.<br/><br/>In Saudi Arabia, RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in infants, and a major cause of admission to hospital. 97.4% of acute respiratory tract infections in children are associated with RSV. The virus is widespread during rainy seasons and winter, starting from October to March, and sometimes can last until April.<br/><br/>Dr. Adel Bin Salem Al Harbi, president of the Saudi Pediatric Pulmonology Association (SPPA), discusses the urgent need for more awareness about RSV in Saudi Arabia during the winter months.<br/><br/>RSV is a common virus that infects the respiratory tract of most children before their second birthday. For most babies and young children, the infection causes nothing more than a cold. However, there are certain groups of pediatric population where it can be severe and life-threatening.<br/><br/>“People at risk of having severe, and sometimes life-threatening, RSV infections include: newborn premature babies, children with heart or lung disease and children with weakened immune systems, like those undergoing chemotherapy or organ transplantation. RSV is the most common cause of pneumonia or bronchiolitis in infants,” explains Dr. Al Harb.<br/><br/>Recognizing the dangers of the disease, a scientific committee composed of Saudi specialists from multi-specialty medical disciplines was formed. Last year, the committee issued national guidelines, called SIBRO (Saudi Initiative of Bronchiolitis Diagnosis, Management and Prevention). SIBRO outlines best practice in managing bronchiolitis in children, as well as information on its diagnosis, treatment and prevention methods. It also includes precautions to prevent RSV as this is the most common cause of bronchiolitis.</p>
