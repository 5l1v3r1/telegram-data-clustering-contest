      <p>Liverpool have been dealt a double injury blow ahead of their clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday with Mohamad Salah and Andy Robertson set to miss out.</p>
      <p>The pair have been doubtful with ankle injuries which have kept them out of international duty.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11865719/mohamed-salah-and-andrew-robertson-set-to-miss-liverpools-trip-to-crystal-palace">Sky Sports News</a> , the pair are now expected to miss the Reds' return to Premier League action at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Salah has been struggling with his damaged ankle since a strong challenge from Hamza Choudhury in Liverpool's 2-1 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> back on October 5.</p>
      <p>The damage forced him to miss their clash at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> before a tackle from Fernandinho saw him aggravate the injury against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in their last game.</p>

      <p>He was filmed with a protective boot on his foot with the Egypt side before withdrawing from international duty and returning to Merseyside.</p>
      <p>Robertson, meanwhile, left the City game with a swollen ankle, forcing him out of Scotland's two games.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his frustration at being unable to captain his national side against Cyprus and Kazakhstan, he said: “I don’t care what game it is, I want to play it and my track record in the last five years has shown that.</p>

      <p>"But I don’t want to pick up more injuries and ruin my season because of it.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had to listen to the people around me when previously I would have told them to beat it. The fact my ankle has swollen up again has made it easier to miss these games.</p>

      <p>"For the last two and a half weeks I’ve not trained at all for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> . I’ve trained the day before a game, missed a Champions League game other than the last 15 minutes against Genk and missed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the League Cup.”</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez and Jordan Henderson also pulled out of international duty, with Gomez suffering a knock in training and Henderson failing to shake of a viral infection.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk also skipped Holland duty due to "personal reasons".</p>
