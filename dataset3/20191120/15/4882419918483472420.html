      <h2>The Real Madrid coach, per Marca, will not act against the Welsh winger</h2>

      <p>Gareth Bale's banner posing has not gone unnoticed at Real Madrid, but if he did it (Wales, golf, Madrid, in that order) to upset the club, he will not achieve his objective.</p>
      <p>Per Marca Zidane will ignore Bale's provocation and is more concerned with his sporting performance and his fitness.</p>
      <p>So he will treat the incident like it did not happen and bring back Bale as if he was any other player returning from international duty - no sanctions, no punishments.</p>
      <p>The fans might not take to him as kindly though.</p>
      <p>Bale had not played since the last international break, missing games injured for Madrid but fit once again to appear for his country.</p>
