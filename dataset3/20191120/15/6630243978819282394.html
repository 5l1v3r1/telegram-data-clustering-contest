      <p>“Food for me is a pleasure. Food for me is a blessing. It is the knowledge of understanding what food does for someone and why it is so important, the most important element of life. So it’s a hobby. It has become a job because it is something I absolutely love. I like to cook, I like to eat, I love to watch, I love to watch food. I love food”, celebrity chef and musician J’something said.</p>

      <p>The crooner has leveraged his musical influence and passion for the culinary arts into a thriving business – A high end restaurant in Pretoria.</p>
      <p>It all started six years ago when a video of a roasted chicken he had prepared went viral.</p>
      <p>“To think that a post on Instagram has become a cooking show. I’ve been doing food like a job for five years, it’s phenomenal. I have cooked with the best chefs in the world. Literally. I have been the headliner of the biggest cooking festivals in South Africa and I have been the headliner of cooking festivals in Africa. I got my own cookbook from this post. I have my own restaurant thanks to this job”, he explained.</p>
      <p>At his restaurant ‘Something’s Cooking By J’Something’, the chef serves up dishes featuring flavors from his Portuguese heritage fused with hearty South African dishes.</p>
      <p>His culinary combinations and signature cocktails have proved popular with his social media fans who follow his posts through the #somethingscooking.</p>
      <p>“I saw his YouTube channel and his show. He had a show on SABC 3 actually. He had…… I think two or three years ago. A few months ago, when I first saw him. What he did was really, really, really, really, really, well. So I was really interested in that kind of thing. So his food is actually very, very impressive and very attractive. So I was like,‘okay cool, let’s see what his story is about”, a diner Leroy Radebe noted.</p>
      <p>By combining talent and creativity, the musician turned chef has been able to use his fame and knowledge to create a name for himself in the restaurant industry.</p>
