      <h1>Taco Bell's answer to chicken sandwich wars</h1>
      <h2>It isn't a sandwich, though</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:10:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author">Scottie Andrew, CNN</a></address>
      <p>(CNN) - Have we reached <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/25/business/mcdonalds-popeyes-chick-fil-a-chicken-sandwich/index.html">crispy chicken sandwich fatigue yet</a>? Because <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/business/free-taco-bell-taco-nationals-trea-turner-trnd/index.html">Taco Bell wants in</a>, even though its entry into the fast food wars isn't really a sandwich at all.</p>
      <p>The house of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/18/us/free-taco-bell-doritos-locos-tacos-trnd/index.html">Doritos Locos Tacos</a> and the mystifying Crunchwrap Supreme is scaling back the theatrics with Crispy Tortilla Chicken -- aka, chicken strips breaded with jalapeno buttermilk and tortilla chips. By <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/us/taco-bell-thanksgiving-bisque-recipe-trnd/index.html">Taco Bell standards</a>, this dish might even be considered pedestrian.</p>
      <p>Notably one of the few menu items without "supreme" in the title, the strips can be enjoyed rolled up in a soft taco or dunked heartily into some dip, the chain says. You won't find any buttered brioche buns at this establishment.</p>
      <p>The spicy strips may not pose an immediate threat to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/03/us/popeyes-chicken-sandwich-twitter-trnd/index.html">Popeyes' now legendary chicken sandwich</a>.</p>
      <p>They're rolling out at Taco Bells in Dayton, Ohio, and Houston before declaring worldwide domination.</p>
      <p>Will Crispy Tortilla Chicken inspire the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/business/popeyes-chicken-sandwich/index.html">same fanfare as its chicken sandwich competitors</a>? It's too soon to say. But with a starting price of $1.99 for the taco version, at least any long waits in line won't cost much.</p>
