        <b>England captain Harry Kane has been labelled ‘the best striker in football right now’ by Spain legend David Villa.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fc-barcelona/">Barcelona</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/valencia/">Valencia</a> forward also claims there is no need for Kane to leave <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> to fulfill his career goals, but he certainly has the capabilities to perform elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Kane has scored nine goals in his last 10 games for club and country, taking his England tally to 32 goals in just 45 appearances in the process.</p>
      <p>With 131 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> goals to his name at just 26-years-old, Villa does not see a better striker on the planet than Kane.</p>
      <p>‘He is the best striker, or No 9, in football right now,’ said the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>‘He is great in almost everything he does, he is one of the candidates for taking the golden boot at Euro 2020 for sure.’</p>

      <p>Villa, who is retiring from football in December when the Japanese season finishes and his time with Vissel Kobe will come to an end, believes Kane has every option open to him.</p>

      <p>The forward has been at Spurs his entire career, but some uncertainty has arisen over his future now Jose Mourinho has taken over as manager at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will undoubtedly want to keep hold of Kane, but if the striker was considering looking for pastures new, then the arrival of the Portuguese may encourage that process.</p>
      <p>‘You don’t need to move to another club to motivate yourself. Harry has always played for Tottenham,’ continued Villa.</p>
      <p>‘I know they are not doing so well this year but I’m not in his mind, I don’t know his future. He will be a good player wherever he goes for sure, he has talent to play in other leagues.’</p>
      <p>Kane has scored six goals in 11 Premier League games so far this campaign and will start for Spurs in Mourinho’s first game in charge away to West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was repeatedly linked with a move for Kane while he was in charge of Manchester United and will be relishing working with the England captain now he has taken the reigns at Tottenham.</p>
