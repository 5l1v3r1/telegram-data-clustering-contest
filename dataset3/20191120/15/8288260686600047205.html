      <p>A start-up eco-friendly business in Sutton Coldfield has been burgled and ransacked by a thief who is believed to have snuck in at closing time - then waited hours before carrying out his crime.</p>
      <p>The Weigh Forward – a packaging-free shop in the town’s market village in South Parade – was targeted last Wednesday (November 13) at around 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>The thief slipped in to the centre just as all the shops were closing at around 5.30pm.</p>
      <p>He then ducked under a shutter and waited, staying in the unit for two hours, before pulling it apart, stealing an iPad used as a till and the business's cash float.</p>

      <p>Rael Todd, who founded the business in July, got an email to say the iPad had been used but thought it was a spam email. She then discovered the break-on on Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old said the burglary is a ‘slap in the face’. She said: “This guy didn’t break-in. He walked in.</p>
      <p>“He went underneath my blinds and waited there in the unit.</p>
      <p>“My iPad which is my till has gone. I got an email at 10.40pm on Wednesday and my purchasing manager, Ashley, he thought it was spam email and said ‘don’t worry about it’.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We then got a notification to say it was ‘cex’s iPad’. We think it may have been sold.</p>
      <p>“When I got to the unit on Thursday morning the chair had been moved out of the way. There was stuff over the floor. He had pulled out all the shelves, looking for stuff</p>
      <p>“I went to the market office and they were looking at CCTV.</p>
      <p>“It’s nobody’s fault. The doors weren’t locked at 5.30pm. On the village’s CCTV you can see a man walking in.</p>

        <figcaption>A burglary suspect in a red coat was spotted entering the Market Village shopping area in Sutton Coldfield</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>“They were just a normal-looking person. A big Asian with a beard. Quite stocky. With a red coat on.</p>
      <p>“We are supposed to get new blinds. There’s a counter and the blinds don’t go all the way down to the floor. We used to put chairs and ladders up against the entrance.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know if we were targeted”</p>
      <p>The thief is said to have gone to the toilets area and used the fire escape at the back of the café to escape.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"He is believed to have left at 7.30pm and was in The Weigh Forward’s unit for two hours.</p>
      <p>Rael said she runs the shop as a community service. She said: “I had to take Thursday off. I suffer from stress and anxiety and have never had this much physical pain for years. I have been upset and crying.</p>
      <p>“It was the first we week we had started selling dried food – porridge oats, couscous, rice, herbs and spices and this happens.</p>
      <p>“I still don’t take a wage from it. I live off Universal Credit. It’s a slap in the face.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The one good thing to happen is the community have rallied around the business and donated cash to help Rael get it back on its feet.</p>
      <p>She added: “I am feeling chuffed the community has helped. People asked for my details and put in a few pounds.</p>
      <p>“We are hoping to get the iPad back. A bakery at the Markey Village are making a Christmas cake for us to raffle.</p>
      <p>“I kind of feel sorry for the person that did this. If they’re that desperate. I’m on the breadline myself. <br/>“But we won’t know until they are caught.”</p>
