        <b>Jose Mourinho was appointed new manager of Tottenham Hotspur to replace the sacked of Mauricio Pochettino on Wednesday (Nov 20).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United boss, 56, signed a contract until the end of the 2022/23 season, the north London club said in a statement.<br/><br/>Pochettino, 47, transformed Spurs’ fortunes since arriving from Southampton in 2014 and although he failed to win a trophy, he took the club to the Champions League final for the first time in their history just six months ago.<br/><br/>But the Argentine was sacked on Wednesday morning (Singapore time), with Tottenham languishing 14th in the English Premier League after picking up just three wins from their opening 12 games.<br/><br/>This season, they were knocked out of the League Cup by fourth-tier Colchester United and suffered an embarrassing 7-2 defeat at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.<br/><br/>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” said Mourinho, who has won domestic titles in a record four different countries.<br/><br/>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.” – <i>AFP</i></p>
