      <h2>UK developer and publisher will kick off new business with tabletop version of Sniper Elite</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1570" target="_blank">James Batchelor</a></address>
      <p>Rebellion is expanding into a new industry with the launch of Rebellion Unplugged, a new division dedicated to board games.</p>
      <p>The UK publisher and developer already produces video games, books, comics and has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-11-26-rebellion-acquires-usd100m-film-studio">branched into TV and film production</a>. Now the firm is capitalising on the rising popularity of tabletop games by bringing its IP to this market.</p>
      <p>Rebellion Unplugged's first release will be Sniper Elite: The Board Game, based on the firm's popular WWII shooters. An early version will be playable at PAX Unplugged in Philadelphia next month, with a Kickstarter campaign due to launch in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Several other games are in the works, with more to be announced next year. The company's IP portfolio also includes 2000 AD (including Judge Dredd), Evil Genius and Sniper Elite spin-off Zombie Army.</p>
      <p>The new division is being lead by Duncan Molloy, founder and creative lead of Osprey Games' board games line-up.</p>
      <p>"We're absolutely delighted to be launching Rebellion Unplugged," said CEO and founder Jason Kingsley. "My brother Chris and I have been making video games for more than 25 years, and our love of the medium has its roots in our childhood love of board games.</p>
      <p>"We've got so many great games and comic book heroes and universes to draw from too, so it's going to be a lot of fun."</p>
