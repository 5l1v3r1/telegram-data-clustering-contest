      <h1>OnePlus 3 and 3T get their very last updates following three years of software support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:26:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/ryne-hager/" target="_blank">Ryne Hager</a></address>
      <p>Back in 2016, the <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/06/21/oneplus-3-review/">OnePlus 3</a> was a shock to the smartphone market, following up on the underwhelming OnePlus 2 with flagship-grade specs at a disruptive $400 price. Sadly, it's the end of an era for both it and the spec-bumped Oneplus 3T, as the pair of phones are getting their very last update.</p>
      <p>The full changelog for the OxygenOS 9.0.6 update for the Oneplus 3 and 3T is rather sparse, and just below:</p>
      <p>
        <b>System</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated Android security patch to 2019.10</li>
        <li>General bug fixes and improvements</li>
        <li>Updated GMS apps</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There isn't a lot to it, with a bump to October's security patch level, the latest Google apps, and the ubiquitous but undefined "bug fixes and improvements" almost every update gets.</p>
      <p>OnePlus' <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-9-0-6-for-oneplus-3-oneplus-3t.1142865/">forum announcement</a> is explicit that this is expected to be the <i>last</i> update for the pair of phones:</p>
      <blockquote>This will be the last update for these two devices and we can't thank you enough for your invaluable feedback throughtout [sic] these three years. With your support, we improved Oxygen OS across three major Android versions and dozens of updates. This is not the end for the OnePlus 3 and 3T, though. Starting next week, we will start highlighting some of great work done by the developer community, for those of you considering to have a go at Custom ROMs.</blockquote>
      <p>For context, the OnePlus 3 was released in <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/06/14/oneplus-3-official-snapdragon-820-6gb-ram-aluminum-unibody-frame/">June of 2016</a>, while the 3T came out later that same year in <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/22/oneplus-3t-now-available-purchase-north-america-starts-439/">November</a> — kicking off the twice-yearly, tick-tock release schedule the company has been fond of since. <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/06/28/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule-promises-two-years-software-updates-three-years-security-patches/">Last year</a>, OnePlus guaranteed 24 months of Android version updates and 36 months for all the phones it still supported at the time. For comparison, <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705?hl=en">Google now promises</a> three years of Android version updates and three years of security updates for its Pixels.</p>
      <p>This news actually means that, as of now, the OnePlus 3 has received software support for longer than the promised 36-month window, likely riding the coattails of the nearly-identical Oneplus 3T for a few extra months of support.</p>
      <p>My personal OnePlus 3 was working until just a few months ago (when a battery swap resulted in a boot loop), but up until the end, it was still a snappy device whose performance belied its age. Those of you still trucking along with a OnePlus 3 or 3T won't be left out in the cold entirely, either. The company plans to eventually highlight a handful of Custom ROMs you can switch to, a process that's <i>relatively</i> easy on OnePlus phones.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, this last update is set to start rolling out over the next few days/weeks. If you'd like to pull it down early, it may be available through the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arjanvlek.oxygenupdater&amp;hl=en_US">third-party Oxygen Updater app</a>.</p>
