        <b>A man from Kirkham is raising money for a Preston hedgehog charity after a baby hog was deliberately killed with a firework.</b>

      <p>Police were called to Pendlebury Close on Friday, November 8 after reports that a firework had been strapped to a hog's head and lit.</p>
      <p>The hog suffered significant injuries after the firework exploded and had to be euthanised.</p>
      <p>PCSO Michael Mitchinson, who has been investigating the cruel act, said the culprit has yet to be identified.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, I have had nobody come forward with any information. No arrests have been made", said the South Ribble PCSO.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The target was exceeded in less than two days and the money has been spent on a special incubator for hedgehogs at a cost of £466.</p>
      <p>"After the horrific attack on a hedgehog by attaching a firework to its head, I’m raising money for a much needed incubator to help these amazing people to care for the rescue hogs.</p>

      <p>"So 36 hours after I launched this appeal to help the Preston Hedgehog Rescue, we smashed the target together", said Mr Hinchcliffe.</p>
      <p>"Your help is so much appreciated. Thank you. I’ve decided to keep the link open and make a few general changes over the next few days and continue to support the work that the rescue do.</p>
      <p>"Please help with the continuing campaign to support the rescue through the winter months and to support projects in 2020."</p>

        <b>What is a hedgehog incubator?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Incubators can be an invaluable part of a hedgehog rescue, as it keeps their temperatures regulated and this helps them to maintain body weight and encourages them to use their own resources to heal and grow.</p>
      <p>From tiny babies weighing just a few grams to fully grown adult hogs, from broken legs to dog attacks and from lung worm infections to malnourished hedgehogs, incubators help to heal them all.</p>
      <p>They can even be used post operations to help hogs heal and recover quicker.</p>
