      <p>The Director General, National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, Kuru, near Jos, Plateau State, Prof. Habu Galadima, says he is optimistic of a possible improvement of the healthcare sector in Nigeria should government implement the report of the findings conducted by participants of the Senior Executive Course 41 of the Institute.</p>
      <p>Galadima made his views known while addressing newsmen on activities lined up for the graduation ceremony of the Senior Executive Course 41 of the Institute slated for Saturday.</p>
      <p>He said the Institute, which was established as the Nation’s apex policy initiator on how to build a better society, had over the years produced quality manpower in the private and public sectors, who are making significant impact in their areas of endeavour.</p>
      <p>He hinted that the Senior Executive Course 41 of the Institute has within the 10 months of rigorous research work, toured 12 States as well as other countries of the world to carry out research on challenges confronting healthcare services in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>He said most of the countries the participants have visited were those that have similar healthcare challenges with Nigeria as well as those countries that have perfect healthcare system.</p>
      <p>Galadima stressed that the participants used the opportunity to interact with top level experts and have integrated the lessons learnt to enrich their recommendations and have since submitted their report.</p>
      <p>He said the recommendations are so rich that, if implemented, the funding challenges confronting Nigeria would be a thing of the past.</p>
