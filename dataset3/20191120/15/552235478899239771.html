      <h1>Rutherglen residents fury after paedophile was housed next to several children</h1>
      <h2>Smith was found guilty of sexually abusing two young children at Hamilton Sheriff Court last month.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:53:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Edel Kenealy</a></address>
      <p>A Rutherglen grandmother has slammed the authorities for housing a paedophile within a block of flats where several young children live.</p>
      <p>Kaff Mcdonald says she is disgusted that Samantha Smith – who was jailed for three years last week – was housed in the same block of flats as her granddaughter while awaiting sentencing for serious sex offences.</p>
      <p>Smith was found guilty of sexually abusing two young children at Hamilton Sheriff Court last month.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old was convicted of repeatedly preying on a boy aged five and a three-year-old girl at a house in East Kilbride between 2009 and 2014.</p>
      <p>Smith caused a scene as she was sentenced, telling Sheriff Douglas Brown: “Paedophiles should be hung, not put in jail. If I’m a paedophile, hang me.”</p>
      <p>At her trial she had yelled, “I’m not a beast”, after a jury found her guilty.</p>
      <p>Now the families who live on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Woodend Road</a> are demanding to know why Smith was housed in Fernhill and within close proximity to their children after being moved from her native Blantyre for her own safety.</p>
      <p>Kaff told the Reformer that residents had their suspicions about Smith after she moved into their building on October 16, but were only certain when she was jailed last week.</p>
      <p>She said: “My daughter and her partner read about the court case and one day they saw her in Fernhill.</p>
      <p>“But they weren’t 100 per cent sure it was the same person. She always had a cap pulled down over her face. My daughter passed her twice in the close and was said afterwards, ‘it’s her, it’s her’.”</p>

      <p>The family’s suspicions were raised further when they read that Smith had been hounded out of her home in Blantyre after people there learned of her conviction.</p>
      <p>Police led her away from the town after a baying crowd gathered at her address.</p>
      <p>Kaff added: “My daughter called me crying saying, ‘she has moved into my close’ and that she wanted to move out.</p>
      <p>“She was so upset that someone like that was allowed to move in.</p>
      <p>“My daughter has a baby and there are other children in the close so it was a big worry to us. It makes you wonder how many other sick people are being put in the scheme.”</p>
      <p>Kaff raised her concerns with a local councillor and was awaiting a response when Smith was jailed. The grandmother says she was reluctant to share her suspicions with others for fear of mistaken identity.</p>
      <p>Liam Purdie, chief social worker at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/mobile-classrooms-cambuslang-school-south-20920129">South Lanarkshire Council</a> , said: “Sex offenders are monitored in the community under the Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) which involve the police service, local authorities, the NHS, Scottish Prison Service and other partners.</p>
      <p>“None of the partners engaged in MAPPA will comment on specific cases or individuals.</p>
      <p>“The management of sex offenders in the community is a particularly sensitive and complex area of work.”</p>
      <p>But he added: “Public safety is always the main priority in all cases.</p>
      <p>“Whilst it remains the main priority, a balance is required between public safety and the right of the individual.</p>
      <p>“All aspects of cases are carefully considered at every stage of the process, from psychological and risk assessments to places of residence and potential security issues.</p>
      <p>“A number of measures can be put in place to manage offenders in the community and these are monitored by dedicated police officers and officials from partner organisations.”</p>
