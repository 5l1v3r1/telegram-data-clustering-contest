      <h1>Northumberland men jailed for torturing captive who was stabbed, beaten and strangled</h1>
      <h2>The victim was held hostage overnight and was forced to call his friends to tell them that he was going to die</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:57:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author">Kieran Murray</a></address>
      <p>Two <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> men who subjected a captive man to a night of physical and mental torture have been sentenced to a total of 34 years in prison.</p>
      <p>David Pattinson, 37, of Braeside, Tweedmouth, and Arthur Collin, 49, of Eyemouth, took their victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons prisoner and put him through an horrific ordeal of stabbing, beating and strangling.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> heard how in April their victim had attended Pattinson's home in the late evening.</p>
      <p>Shortly after, Pattinson 'flipped', locking doors of his home and restraining the man in a chair.</p>
      <p>Over the following hours Pattinson, later joined by his friend Arthur Collin, tortured their victim; jabbing him in the face with a knife, stabbing him with a screwdriver, beating him and strangling him into unconsciousness.</p>
      <p>The duo also forced the man to contact his friends by phone and tell them that he was going to die.</p>
      <p>The Crown Prosecution Service said it was only 'good fortune' that the victim managed to escape as his captors attempted to bundle him into a car the following morning.</p>

      <p>Claire Wright of the CPS said: "Pattinson was seemingly motivated by financial pressures and difficulties over access to his children, for which he inexplicably blamed the victim. Collin’s motivation is less clear but he travelled from his home nearly ten miles away to join Pattinson in torturing the man.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult to imagine how terrifying this experience must have been."</p>
      <p>Pattinson and Collin were both found guilty of false imprisonment and wounding with intent.</p>
      <p>Pattinson was also found guilty of a charge of making threats to kill, possession of cannabis, possession of cocaine with intent to supply and a further charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent in relation to a separate incident.</p>
      <p>Both were found not guilty of conspiracy to murder, rape and possessing an imitation firearm.</p>

      <p>Ms Wright added: "During the investigation of this case, Pattinson and Collin have attempted to distance themselves from their actions by claiming that their victim had attended Pattinson’s home voluntarily, before inflicting serious injuries upon himself.</p>
      <p>"By piecing together medical evidence and mobile phone data the Crown Prosecution Service has dismantled that false narrative to deliver today’s sentences, in which we sincerely hope the victims of his violent offending can find some measure of comfort."</p>
      <p>Pattinson was sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court to a 20-year extended determinate sentence with Collin jailed for 14 years on Wednesday.</p>
