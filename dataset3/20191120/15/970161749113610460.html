      <p>Eight migrants were rescued from a refrigerated lorry after they alerted people by throwing out fruit.</p>
      <p>Police on their way to a crash noticed oranges bouncing onto the road from a small hole in the vehicle when it stopped during a traffic jam in Cambridgeshire.</p>
      <p>They raided the lorry yesterday, and found suspected illegal immigrants inside.</p>
      <p>Emergency services including an air ambulance rushed to the scene on the A14 in Huntingdon, and three of the eight people found in the lorry were taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>A man has since been arrested on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>The air ambulance was called to the scene shortly before 12.30pm after receiving reports that one individual was seriously unwell.</p>
