      <p>He said on Sky Sports F1: <i>"Mercedes have to be a little bit worried and concerned about this.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I know there’s the altitude and some other factors but that car looks fantastic, it’s not just the Honda engine, it’s the balance they’ve got, and the driver they’ve got. With Max in the car they’re very strong.</i>

        <i>“You can’t help but think that in Lewis’ mind he’s thinking, this is the guy that’s going to come and get me. If Lewis is going to have another four or five seasons in Formula 1, he’s going to have to deal with that a lot.”</i>
