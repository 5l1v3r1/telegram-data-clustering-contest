        <b>Wahid Muzhda, an Afghan political analyst, was assassinated Wednesday in Kabul when at least one unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle attacked him in the PD7 area close to the Russian embassy, the Ministry of Interior confirmed.</b>

      <p>Nasrat Rahimi, the ministry spokesman, said the incident occurred around 5:00 pm while Muzhda was going to the mosque.</p>
      <p>The reason for his death is not clear, and police are investigating the incident, Rahimi added.</p>
      <p>According to Rahimi, the attackers fled the area after assassinating Muzhda.</p>
      <p>Muzhda was a poet and writer, and worked in the Foreign Ministry during the Taliban's regime and was a member of the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar Party.</p>
      <p>Muzhda also published a book titled “Afghanistan.”</p>
      <p>Muzhda was accused of expressing opinions that supported the Taliban, and he had reportedly been arrested by the National Directorate of Security.</p>
      <p>Muzhda was born in 1953 in Baghlan province, completed his elementary education at Habibia High School in Kabul, and earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Kabul University.</p>
      <p>The attack on Muzhda has been heavily condemned on social media, and many described his death as a loss to the nation.</p>
      <p>So far no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.</p>
      <p>Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah on social media expressed his condolences to the family and friends of Muzhda.</p>
      <p>Omar Zakhilwal, a former Afghan envoy to Pakistan, condemned Muzhda’s assassination and condemned “a trend of targeting individuals who work for peace and freedom of speech.”</p>
      <p>According to Zakhilwal, political activism is an achievement of the past 18 years and now it is under threat.</p>
