      <h2>The Black Cats are back in League One action and face a vital game at the Stadium of Light ahead third-place City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:12:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:12</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Jamieson</a></address>
      <p>After four cup games - all without a win - Sunderland get back to the bread and butter of their League One campaign.</p>
      <p>And it couldn't be a bigger fixture with third-placed Coventry City at the Stadium of Light for a vital match.</p>
      <p>Promotion is, of course, the only target for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> and Co and, with games in hand, wins on Saturday and against Burton Albion next Tuesday, could change the picture dramatically.</p>
      <p>Here's all you need to know.</p>
      <h3>When is Sunderland vs Coventry?</h3>
      <p>The game takes place on Saturday, November 23, with a 3pm kick-off. It is one of full League One fixture list.</p>
      <h3>Is Sunderland vs Coventry on TV? How can I follow it live?</h3>
      <p>International fans can buy a match pass on Sunderland's official website to watch the game online by purchasing a match pass for Â£5.99. You can purchase a pass <a href="https://www.safc.com/news/club-news/2019/november/scunthorpe-a-efl-streaming-passes">here.</a></p>

      <h3>What are the injury concerns? Who is in the teams?</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> will have Jon McLaughlin, Tom Flanagan, Conor McLaughlin and Benji Kimpioka back from international duty, but face a wait of several injury concerns. Jordan Willis, Joel Lynch and George Dobson sat out the FA Cup defeat at Gillingham, while Lynden Gooch and Charlie Wyke are nearing fitness.</p>
      <p><b>Sunderland likely XI:</b> Burge; C McLaughlin, Ozturk, Lynch, Hume; Power, Dobson, Watmore, Maguire, McGeady, Grigg.</p>

      <h3>Who is the ref?</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>It's the first time referee Oldham has taken charge of the Black Cats this season. He was last on Wearside for the 1-1 draw with Burton Albion last April, while he also officiated the draw at Oxford in February, also a 1-1 scoreline.</p>
