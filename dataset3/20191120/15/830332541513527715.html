      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - A group that promotes student voting has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Wisconsin's student voter identification requirements.</p>
      <p>The Andrew Goodman Foundation filed the lawsuit in Madison on Tuesday. The foundation alleges that requirements that students present IDs that contain the issuance date, the holder's signature and an expiration date no later than two years after the issuance date are too onerous and are designed to stop young people from voting in violation of the 26th Amendment.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit names the members of the Wisconsin Elections Commission as defendants. Commission spokesman Reid Magney didn't immediately respond to an email Wednesday seeking comment.</p>
      <p>Priorities USA Foundation is funding the lawsuit. That foundation announced in February that it plans to spend $30 million to finance court challenges to restrictive Republican-backed voter laws.</p>
