      <p>RUGBY WORLD CUP champions South Africa will face Scotland twice and play a one-off match with Georgia in July next year.</p>
      <p>The Springboks secured a famous victory over England in a surprisingly one-sided final in Japan last month, Rassie Erasmus’ side running out 32-12 winners. </p>
      <p>By contrast, Scotland failed to qualify from their pool after losing to Ireland and Japan.</p>
      <p>The Scots will head to South Africa for a pair of fixtures on 4 and 11 July, with the Springboks also scheduled to host Georgia the following week.</p>
      <p>While South Africa and Scotland have met many times, the Boks have faced Georgia only once – in a pool match at the 2003 Rugby World Cup.</p>
      <p>Georgia won one of their four games in Japan, beating Uruguay 33-7.</p>
