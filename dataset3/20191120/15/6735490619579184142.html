      <p>“Well, it’s like, so 100. Okay, so he was 100. Big birthday, big birthday. The trouble is, when you’re 100, you don’t really want a big birthday,” Michael recalled. “I threw a big party for him, it was great.”</p>
      <p>But after turning 101, Kirk begged Michael to turn “big” into “low key.”</p>

      <p>“101. You know, ‘Okay, let’s have a nice party.’ ‘Again? I don’t…’ ‘Dad, it’s 101 years old. You have to have a birthday.’ Okay… 102…,” Michael explained. “So now he’s begging me, he’s got tears down his eyes. ‘Let’s just have dinner, the family together. Bring the kids.’”</p>
      <p>Later on in the interview, Michael gushed about his 19 years of marriage with Catherine Zeta-Jones.</p>
      <p>Kirk turns 103 on Dec. 9.</p>
