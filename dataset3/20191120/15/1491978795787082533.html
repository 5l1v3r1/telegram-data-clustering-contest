        <i>Fifteen quid an hour and you get to choose the coolest clothes, food and drinks … for your bosses, whom you also have to wake up in the morning</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Age:</b> New posting.</p>
      <p><b>Appearance:</b> Part time, about four hours a day.</p>
      <p><b>How much?</b> £15 an hour.</p>
      <p><b>Qualifications: </b>“If you’re reading this and you’re the right person you have a big smile all over your face.”</p>
      <p><b>Nope. Any others?</b> “The kind of person that is a perfectionist and will continue to think of ways for us to improve our quality of life and make us and the people around us happy.”</p>
      <p><b>And who is us, exactly?</b> “We’re three young entrepreneurs that run a business in central London and live together in a Mega flat near Old Street.”</p>
      <p><b>That sounds like the premise of a terrible sitcom. Is it a joke?</b> No, it is a <a href="https://www.gumtree.com/p/admin-and-pa-jobs/lifestyle-happiness-manager-for-entrepreneurs-in-beautiful-flat/5396930178">genuine ad</a> on the website Gumtree, posted by someone called James, seeking a very modern kind of dogsbody.</p>
      <p><b>Like a cleaner?</b> No, they have a cleaner but they need someone who “isn’t afraid to muck in”.</p>
      <p><b>What actual duties are involved?</b> “You’re the first face I’m going to see when I open my eyes every day (part of this role is waking me up, as I really don’t like alarm clocks ),” says James.</p>
      <p><b>I am not doing that. </b>Also, ensuring the fridge “is always stocked with perfect snacks”.</p>
      <p><b>OK. What kind of thing?</b> “We try to be healthy with our food (apart from the chocolate cupboard, which Willy Wonker [sic] would be proud of),” it says.</p>
      <p><b>Do I get a clothing allowance?</b> Yes, but only for their clothes. “We have a serious sneaker collection going on,” say the lads, “so keep your eye on the latest releases and make sure we’re not missing out.”</p>
      <p><b>This is the most punchable ad I have ever read. Have I missed anything?</b> Stocking the bathrooms, coordinating the dry-cleaning, cooking breakfast, changing the beds, organising parties and more.</p>
      <p><b>More?</b> “Thinking of ways we can improve the interior design of the flat … Making juices and bringing them to the office … cleaning all of the shoes and making them bran (sic) spanking for every wear. ”</p>
      <p><b>All that in four hours a day? </b>“Oh yeah and we might be getting a dog in six months or so, so it helps if you’re dog friendly as you’re likely to be nannying our little pooch.”</p>
      <p><b>I’m tempted to seek an interview, for all the wrong reasons. </b>“Put the time into your application,” they say. “This might be the last time you ever do one.”</p>
      <p><b>Do say:</b> “This might be the last time <i>you</i> ever do one.”</p>
      <p><b>Don’t say:</b> “An advert any Wonker would be proud of.”</p>
