      <p>British singer-songwriter Elton John said he was so worried about getting the words wrong when performing an adaptation of Candle In The Wind at <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/dress-princess-diana-wore-dancing-travolta-sale-191119053201569.html">Princess Diana</a>'s funeral that he had a teleprompter installed by the piano.</p>
      <p>John, who was a friend of Princess Diana, sang the new version of the hit song using revised words penned by lyricist and frequent collaborator Bernie Taupin.</p>
      <p>His performance at London's Westminster Abbey in 1997, after Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in the French capital Paris, was a standout moment at a televised service watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world.</p>
      <p>The song, featuring the line "Goodbye England's rose" instead of the original words "Goodbye Norma Jean", went on to become the fastest-selling single in the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">United Kingdom</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's the first time I had a teleprompter, a teleprompter down on my left-hand side because I thought if I sing 'Goodbye Norma Jean' I'm gonna get hung, drawn and quartered," John told a London audience late on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"So just for precaution, I had the teleprompter there."</p>
      <h3>Autobiography</h3>
      <p>The 72-year-old was speaking at the Royal Academy of Music, where he once studied, at an event to mark the publication of his autobiography, Me: Elton John.</p>
      <p>He described the process by which he and Taupin worked together on some of their greatest hits.</p>
      <p>"He [Bernie] always gives me a lyric," John said. "I go into a room, put the lyric on the piano, look at the title. And as I start reading the song, a little movie comes in my head a bit like writing a film score where you get the visual part.</p>
      <p>"By the time I finish the song or the lyric, I kind of know what tempo it might be or what genre it could be. And I just literally put my hands on the piano and that's it. I hope for the best. That is it."</p>
