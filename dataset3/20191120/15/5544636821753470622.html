      <p>The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has said they have nothing to hide by a request by the Minister of Youths and Sports Sunday Dare to provide an explanation over the poor performances of Nigerian teams.</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that the<a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/fg-queries-nff-over-nigerian-teams-performance/"> Minister of Sports Dare had met with the NFF where he expressed dismay over the poor showing of Nigerian teams</a> in major international competitions lately.</p>
      <p>According to the NFF President Amaju Pinnick, however, “It was a good move by the Honourable Minister to request for the report.</p>
      <p>“As he said, there has to be stock-taking and after that, accountability. The NFF is enamoured by the move and we have submitted the requested report.</p>
      <p>“For us, there is nothing to hide. We have detailed all the issues and the forces at play, and explained that in so much as these tournaments are important; they are mainly and strategically developmental.</p>
      <p>“Even at that, we approach every match/tournament with the intention of winning, but it is practically and absolutely impossible based on indices, records and scientific laws of probability.”</p>
      <p>Concise News understands that in a 15 –page letter signed by Pinnick, the NFF detailed funding (inadequacy and late release of same), the toxic and disruptive environment in which it has had to operate for the past 18 months (with the Federation’s leadership and brand falsely and maliciously dragged from one investigative agency to the other and from one court to the other on same baseless allegations) as major reasons for the poor outings of the Super Falcons, CHAN Eagles, Golden Eaglets and Olympic Eagles in recent matches.</p>
