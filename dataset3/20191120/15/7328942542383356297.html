      <p>At a U.S. national science and engineering competition for middle schoolers, all <a href="https://www.upworthy.com/girls-won-all-five-top-prizes-in-national-stem-contest-for-middle-schoolers"><b>five</b></a> top prizes were awarded to girls for the first time ever this year. </p>
      <p>The competition known as the <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/broadcom-masters">Broadcom MASTERS</a>, or Math, Applied Science, Technology, and Engineering for Rising Stars, takes place every year. It's run by the Society for Science &amp; the Public along with the Broadcom Foundation. </p>
      <p>The awards were presented in Washington D.C. on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/girls-sweep-top-awards-national-stem-contest-middle/story?id=66912699">October 29th</a>.</p>

      <p>Maya Ajmera, president and CEO of the Society for Science &amp; the Public <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/girls-sweep-top-awards-national-stem-contest-middle/story?id=66912699">told ABC News</a> that, "We are just so thrilled that the top five winners were girls this year," Ajmera said. "This is the first time in our history that it was a sweep for girls. It’s also the first time in our history that we had more girl finalists than boy finalists."</p>
      <p>Alaina Gassler, 14 years old and from Pennsylvania, won the top award: the <a href="http://broadcomfoundation.org/masters/winners-2019/">Samueli Foundation Prize</a>. She brought home the title and <b>$25,000</b> for her <a href="https://interestingengineering.com/14-year-old-pennsylvania-girl-finds-solution-for-blind-spots-in-cars">project on reducing blind spots while driving</a>. </p>
      <p>Gassler gained her inspiration from observing her mother while driving. Her mother was so frustrated by these dangerous blind spots that Gassler looked up how many accidents occur each year due to blind spots, and decided to do something about it. </p>
      <p>She designed a system that uses a webcam to display anything that's in a driver's blind spot.</p>
