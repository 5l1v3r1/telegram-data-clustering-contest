      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>Save up to 30% on outdoor tech, wearables, GoPros and more with <a href="https://zdcs.link/o74NL">REI’s Winter ‘Gear Up Get Out’ sale</a>.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Going on an outdoor adventure this winter? There’s a right and wrong way to do that. The right way, of course, is to make sure you’ve got the right gear to keep you toasty. The wrong way is to give up after two minutes because your toes are cold.</p>
      <p>If exploring the backcountry is your jam, a <a href="https://www.rei.com/s/gugo-electronics-deals?ir=collection%3Agugo-electronics-deals&amp;r=brand%3Agarmin">Garmin watch</a> will keep you from getting lost in the woods. With REI’s sale, you can save $100 on a variety of GPS watches that are all loaded with features, from maps to health-monitoring to music streaming, so the only thing you’ll be getting lost in is a great playlist.  </p>

      <p>Say you’re hiking with no cell service, and you want to send a message so your family doesn’t worry. Use Garmin’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/rPe88">inReach Mini Satellite communicators</a> for off-the-grid contact that lets you send and receive text messages. You can even track and share your journey online, receive weather updates, and send that SOS if you really need to. All that functionality at a mere 3.5 ounces! </p>

      <p>Now let’s talk GoPro, because if you’re on an epic outdoor adventure you’ll want to capture it in epic proportions. With REI’s sale, you get a $50 bonus card with your purchase of a <a href="https://zdcs.link/ZelXm">GoPro HERO8</a> black camera — which <a href="https://mashable.com/review/gopro-hero-8/">we’ve called the best GoPro yet</a>. This bad boy delivers insanely smooth footage with three levels of stabilization, and features plenty of new and fun ways to shoot and edit. </p>

      <p>That’s not even scratching the surface of the warm-weather clothes, boots, sleeping bags, and all sorts of camping gear on sale. Other deals include eco-friendly Nalgene water bottles: buy one and get one of equal or lesser value for free. </p>
      <p>Moral of the story? When you’ve got the latest gear and technology, the great outdoors is a great alternative to staying inside and looking at other people’s hiking photos. And if you’re not quite ready to brave the chill, you can shop <a href="https://www.rei.com/h/gear-up-get-out-sale">REI’s winter sale </a>from the couch. </p>
