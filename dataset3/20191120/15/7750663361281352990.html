      <h1>Erling Haaland's father wants son to snub Manchester United?</h1>
      <h2>The father of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/red-bull-salzburg/"><b>Red Bull Salzburg</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erling-haaland/"><b>Erling Haaland</b></a> is reportedly keen for his son to snub a move to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> in favour of joining a German club.</h2>

      <p>Haaland has scored 26 times in 18 appearances for Salzburg this season, including four in seven Champions League appearances during a fine start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>United are seen by many as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-united-would-loan-haaland-back-to-salzburg_379146.html">the favourites</a> to sign the 19-year-old, with the Red Devils <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/haaland-father-visits-man-united-training-ground_379841.html">recently welcoming</a> Haaland's father, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alf-inge-haaland/"><b>Alf-Inge Haaland</b></a>, to the club's training complex.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Bild</i>, the striker's father believes that his son would be better off making a smaller step to a German club - potentially RB Leipzig - before switching to a more high-profile side in the future.</p>
      <p>The report claims that securing regular football has been placed high on Alf-Inge's priority list during a key stage of development for the Norway international.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus are also believed to interested in signing the youngster either in January or at the end of the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
