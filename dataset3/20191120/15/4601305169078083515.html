      <h1>DoJ to scrap the Paramount antitrust rule that prohibits movie studios from buying or strong-arming movie theaters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:09:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>Through the 1940s and 1950s, the DoJ went to war on the "studio system" -- a system whereby studios locked up actors in exclusive contracts and then bought or strong-armed all the movie theaters in America so that they'd screen whatever the studios made, freezing out independent productions from movie companies that might offer their talent a better, less restrictive deal.</p>
      <p>The result was the "Paramount decrees," a set of rules that, for 70 years, have acted as a check on monopolistic conduct from the increasingly monopolistic film industry, which is now down to four major studios, thanks to the US government's consent to a merger between Disney and Fox.</p>
      <p>Now, in response to "changing market conditions," the DoJ is set to ask the Southern District of New York to end the rule, just as new streaming services <a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/11/07/marvel-lucas-pixar-fox.html">are set to end creators' access to residual payments</a> for the ongoing use of their compositions, scripts, performances, and other creative endeavors.</p>
      <p>The new regime could see mergers with America's already vastly over-concentrated movie theater industry, which has been sewn up by the Chinese owned AMC and a handful of also-ran competitors. It could also see a return to "block booking" and other practices that let the major studios tie up movie screens, depriving smaller and independent producers of access to audiences.</p>
      <p>The DoJ is also set to get rid of up to 1,000 consent decrees, including the ones governing music licensing, giving far more power to ASCAP and BMI.</p>
      <blockquote>“The sunset period will allow the defendants and movie theaters a period of transition to adjust to any licensing proposals that seek to change the theater-by-theater and film-by-film licensing structure currently mandated by the decrees,” Delrahim said in a speech to the American Bar Association’s fall antitrust gathering. <br/><br/>The consent decrees also barred studios from owning movie theaters without a court’s approval and banned rules setting minimum prices for movies.</blockquote>
