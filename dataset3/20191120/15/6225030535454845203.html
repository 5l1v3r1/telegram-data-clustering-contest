      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Almond_Eye">Almond Eye</a></b> is among a stellar lineup of 50 horses, 26 of them Grade/Group 1 winners, selected for the Hong Kong International Races on Dec. 8 at Sha Tin.<br/>The HKIR is the sport’s global year-end Group 1 extravaganza and features the HK$28 million <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Hong_Kong_Cup">Hong Kong Cup</a></b> (1 1/4 miles), the HK$25 million <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Hong_Kong_Mile">Hong Kong Mile</a></b>, the HK$20 million <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Hong_Kong_Sprint">Hong Kong Sprint</a></b> (6/8 of a mile) and the HK$20 million <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Hong_Kong_Vase">Hong Kong Vase</a></b> (1 1/2 miles).<br/>The exciting fields for the four Group 1 features also include big-name Europeans. The six-strong Irish party includes G1 Irish Champion Stakes and Champion Stakes (G1) heroine Magical as an entry. According to European reports, she's expected to remain retired, however, leaving recent Group 1 winner Magic Wand to challenge Almond Eye.</p>
      <p>Last year, Beauty Generation, Mr Stunning, Exultant and Glorious Forever completed an unprecedented Hong Kong-based sweep, and and the quartet is engaged to defend their crowns. Beauty Generation in the Mile and Mr Stunning in the Sprint will attempt to match legendary miler Good Ba Ba’s record of three straight wins at the meeting.<br/>Here's a look at the individual events:<br/><b>Hong Kong Cup<br/></b>World superstar Almond Eye heads to Sha Tin with a record of eight wins from 10 starts, with six Group 1 victories to her name. After winning last year’s Fillies’ Triple Crown in Japan, the 4-year-old smashed her rivals in the Dubai Turf at Meydan and ran with merit at a mile when third in the Yasuda Kinen. The daughter of two-time Hong Kong Sprint winner Lord Kanaloa returned from a long summer break with an impressive success in the Tenno Sho Autumn in October. Compatriot Win Bright is one from one at the course and distance thanks to his Group 1 FWD QEII Cup win in April.<br/>Among those out to prevent a sixth Japanese win in the race is recent Group 1 Mackinnon Stakes winner Magic Wand, trained by Aidan O'Brien. Last year’s winner, Glorious Forever, is engaged again, as is his full brother and 2017 victor Time Warp. The biggest home contenders could be the improving Group 1-placed Rise High and last season’s BMW Hong Kong Derby hero Furore.<br/><b>Hong Kong Mile<br/></b>Good Ba Ba is the only horse in HKIR history to win three times, and he achieved the feat in the Hong Kong Mile in consecutive years. Beauty Generation, imperious in making it two wins in a row last year and another star of world racing, will have to bounce back from two recent defeats if he is to make the hat trick. The world’s top-rated miler will face his latest conqueror, the improving Waikuku, as well as some brilliant overseas raiders.<br/>Japan’s assault has a formidable look to it: Indy Champ defeated Almond Eye when taking the Group 1 Yasuda Kinen in June and last weekend the colt saw off the highly-regarded Danon Premium to win the second of his country’s two big mile races, the Group 1 Mile Championship, the same two races the powerhouse champion Maurice won before taking this prize in 2015; two-time Group 1 winner Admire Mars, the Group 1-winning filly Normcore and the top-class Persian Knight are also selected for Japan. Ireland’s Circus Maximus represents the best European mile form, having won the Group 1 St James’s Palace Stakes and Group 1 Prix du Moulin this year.<br/><b>Hong Kong Sprint<br/></b>Mr Stunning has peaked for the last two editions of this race and will attempt to become the Hong Kong Sprint’s first three-time winner. But he faces the flash new kid on the Hong Kong sprinting block, Aethero, who will attempt to become the first Southern Hemisphere-bred 3-year-old to win a Group 1 at the HKIR: the chestnut, sensational when winning the recent Group 2 Jockey Club Sprint, has drawn comparisons to past champion Able Friend.</p>
      <p>The outstanding lineup includes plenty of other top-class contenders too: the talented grey Hot King Prawn is back from a setback and is a Group 2 winner of untapped potential at this level, while Hong Kong’s champion sprinter Beat The Clock is in, as is D B Pin, runner-up in the past two editions. Japan’s Danon Smash and Australia’s In Her Time provide the overseas challenge.<br/><b>Hong Kong Vase<br/></b>Exultant has proven to be one of the world’s top stayers since winning last year’s Vase, which saw subsequent Cox Plate winner Lys Gracieux in second place and Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe hero Waldgeist in fifth. Hong Kong’s champion stayer is set to face another tough lineup with Japan and Europe offering strong contenders.<br/>Anthony Van Dyck is set to become the first Epsom Derby winner to contest the Hong Kong Vase. The Ballydoyle-trained colt is selected alongside well-regarded stablemate Mount Everest, who missed most of this year but returned in the autumn to run a promising sixth in the Breeders’ Cup Turf. The British raiders are Aspetar, winner of the Group 1 Preis von Europa; Prince Of Arran, who has made the frame in the past two renewals of the Melbourne Cup; and the well-regarded Group 3 winner Young Rascal.<br/>Japan has some of its best fillies and mares slated to take on Exultant: Deirdre, runner-up in the Hong Kong Cup last year, has been a marvel on her travels this year and won the Group 1 Nassau Stakes; Lucky Lilac won the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Cup at Kyoto last time; Group 1 Yushun Himba winner Loves Only You met her first defeat in five starts when third that day; Glory Vase is a Group 2 winner and Group 1-placed.</p>
