      <h2>Rovers have progressed in two cup competitions this month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:41:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:41</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Graham Coughlan says he is hoping for some money to spend after Bristol Rovers progressed in both the FA Cup and EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">The Gas</a> beat Bromley in an FA Cup first round replay last night to progress to round two, where they will face Plymouth Argyle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers'</a> original game against Bromley was moved to Sunday so that it could form part of the BBC's FA Cup Final Score programme, with last night's replay being shown on BT Sport.</p>

      <p>Their second round game against Plymouth will receive a similar treatment to the first Bromley game, with it also being moved to Sunday for BBC coverage.</p>
      <p>It has meant <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> have netted some extra cash in the last month, both through prize money and broadcasting payments, and Coughlan is keen to spend it.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's been a very positive couple of weeks, being on the telly and getting through to the next round of the EFL Trophy.</p>
      <p>"Finances aren't my issue, I'm not a financial man - I never have been and I never will.</p>
      <p>"It's those lads upstairs that are probably best to judge but I'm just hoping that progression that we've made, the game on the telly, games being moved to a Sunday, I just hope that the kitty is building and we may be able to do a player or two in January."</p>
