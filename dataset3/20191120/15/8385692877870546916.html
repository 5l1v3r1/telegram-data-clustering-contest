      <p>Today's Doorbuster from <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Best Buy</a> features a sale on a four-pack of Arlo Pro 2 security cameras for just $399.</p>
      <p>This is $250 off of its regular price, and does match its advertised Black Friday price. This makes it a really great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>The Arlo Pro 2 is a wire-free indoor/outdoor security camera that you can use to keep an eye on your home when you're not at home. Because it is wire-free, it allows you to place it outside or elsewhere without needing to run a cord to it for power.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The battery on the Arlo Pro 2 lasts around six months, though this will depend on your recording settings. If you set it to only record when it sees motion or people, then it will definitely last six months, if not longer. And when you need to recharge it, you can just take down the camera and plug it into a USB-C cable. The camera is mounted by magnets, so it's super simple to put up and take down.</p>
      <p>Arlo Pro 2 does have a pretty wide sensor, making it great for keeping an eye on your entire front yard, including your porch where you might have packages. This is really great during this time of year where people are stealing packages left and right. Since it is the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Finally, Arlo Pro 2 does work with Amazon Alexa. Allowing you to bring up the camera feed on the big screen, and seeing what's going on outside of your home. It also works on Amazon Fire tablets and Echo Show devices. Which is really useful for those that already are very invested into the Alexa ecosystem.</p>
