      <p>Owner Gerrard Aindow told the ECHO: "It’s a lovely thing. I collected it from Inverness last year and completely refurbished it - it's a proper show stopper."</p>
      <p>The sleigh, which is £150 to hire for 24 hours, is the ideal addition to any Christmas party, display or even <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/meet-santa-christmas-grottos-liverpool-10417113">grotto</a> and will be available throughout November and December.</p>
