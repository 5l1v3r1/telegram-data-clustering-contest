      <p>Two RAF fighter jets were scrambled to escort a packed Jet2 passenger flight back to Stansted, after a woman tried to open the door of the plane mid-flight.</p>
      <p>Chloe Haines, 26, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, is alleged to have been drunk when she assaulted a member of cabin crew who tried to restrain her during the incident on June 22.</p>
      <p>The flight was travelling to Dalaman in Turkey, before the pilot was forced to return to Stansted.</p>
      <p>Haines was given an £85,000 bill by Jet2, who also banned her for life from flying with the airline.</p>
      <p>She appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court today, charged with one count of assault by beating and one count of recklessly or negligently acting in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft or person in an aircraft.</p>
      <p>She was arrested by Essex Police upon landing.</p>
      <p>On board the flight, a cabin crew member allegedly suffered scratches as she tried to prevent Haines from opening the plane door.</p>

      <p>She did not enter pleas during the 10-minute hearing.</p>
      <p>District Judge Timothy King granted Haines conditional bail on the grounds that she does not travel from any UK airport.</p>
      <p>He sent her case to Chelmsford Crown Court, where she is due to appear on December 18.</p>
