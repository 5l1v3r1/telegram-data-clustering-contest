      <h1>Man Utd dealt Erling Haaland transfer blow by RB Leipzig's reduced fee option</h1>
      <h2>Man Utd have tracked Red Bull Salzburg ace Erling Haaland but they could lose out to Leipzig who can get the marksman on the cheap</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:49:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a>'s hopes of signing Erling Haaland have been dealt a blow after it emerged Red Bull Leipzig can get the forward in a cut price deal.</p>
      <p>Haaland has become one of Europe's hottest properties this season after scoring 26 goals in all competitions.</p>
      <p>His exploits have attracted United's interest as well as a host of other top European sides.</p>
      <p>But Leipzig, who share the same owners as the Austrian side, can bring Haaland to the Bundesliga for just €30m (£25.7m) according to <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/bundesliga/vereine/rb-leipzig/erling-haaland-red-bull-salzburg-poker-transfer-66134768.sport.html?wtmc=twttr.shr">Bild</a> .</p>
      <p>United have been quoted a fee of around £85m - more than three times what the German side can sign him for.</p>

      <p>Haaland's father Alf-Inge, who played in the Premier League with Leeds and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , has told his son it is better to be playing than be sat on the bench.</p>
      <p>That further increases the appeal of Leipzig who, after heavy investment, have become a challenger in Germany with Julian Nagelsmann at the helm.</p>
      <p>Markus Krösche, Leipzig's sporting director, admits steps are already being considered which could see the 19-year-old leave Austria.</p>

      <p>He said: "The boy is a very good player. Both in the league and in the Champions League, he does an exceptionally good job. Of course, we are already looking around for the summer. "</p>
      <p>Haaland only made the switch from Norwegian side Molde last year for £4.5m, but has proved to be a hit.</p>
      <p>Mino Raiola is also said to be advising the young forward who has scored goals in all three of his Champions League appearances this season.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been assured of the funds to sign top class players and is eyeing a frontman at the earliest possible option.</p>
      <p>Mario Mandzukic is a name that has long been linked given his availability but the Red Devils' transfer policy places an emphasis on young talent.</p>
