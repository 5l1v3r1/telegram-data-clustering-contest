      <p>Mr Logic has somewhat corroborated Shatta Wale’s infamous ‘Ghana is a village’ statement when he bemoaned the lack of support for talented artists in the music industry during an interview on Hitz FM.</p>
      <p>In his words, Mr Logic said he simply can’t comprehend why noisy and useless songs are promoted whiles great songs are shoved into the dustbin.</p>
      <p>To this end, he believes such behaviour is only tantamount to lack of enlightenment as he went ahead to label Ghanaians as villagers because we don’t appreciate people who do good music.</p>
      <p>Mr Logic, who was clearly in a firing mood also tuned his guns at radio presenters for their failure to promote good songs  because most of them are corrupt who take payola to propagate terrible sounds.</p>
      <p>He used singer Yaa Yaa to illustrate his point, saying the inability of the singer to be a superstar like other female artistes despite her great talent is a clear indication of this annoying trend.</p>
      <p>He said: “It hurts that after soo many years of knowing her, Yaa Yaa and with all the great things that she has accomplished she still hasn’t won best female vocalist”.</p>
