      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> are set to begin talks with Lille to sign highly respected sporting director Luis Campos, a long-time friend of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> credited with unearthing a host of superstars.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach was officially announced as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s successor on Wednesday morning, with the Argentine dismissed just five months after the Champions League final following a poor start to the campaign.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has already raided Lille twice to bring in new assistant Joao Sacramento and goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos, with the French side confirming the news.</p>

      <p>But Spurs may not stop there, with <a href="https://www.espn.com.au/football/tottenham-hotspur/story/3994516/sources-tottenham-mourinho-target-luis-campos-for-sporting-director-role">ESPN</a> reporting that Mourinho wants the club to prise Campos away from Lille and head up recruitment at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The two men are close friends and, during his time out of work, Mourinho frequently made the trip from London to Lille to watch the Ligue 1 side in the company of Campos.</p>

      <p>He was a key scout under Mourinho at Real Madrid before becoming sporting director at Monaco, where he oversaw an impressive recruitment drive that culminated in a run to the Champions League semi-final.</p>
      <p>He bought the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Fabinho, Bernardo Silva, James Rodriguez and Benjamin Mendy, turning over massive profits while remaining competitive on the pitch.</p>
      <p>That continued at Lille, making massive profits on Nicolas Pepe and Rafael Leao over the summer after assembling a side that finished second in Ligue 1 last season and qualified for the Champions League.</p>

      <p>Mourinho wanted Campos at Manchester United and is eager for a reunion, while Spurs are believed to have been keen to appoint such a figure while Pochettino was in charge but he rejected the idea.</p>
      <p>Campos has previously said he would be open to moving to the Premier League – and even working with Mourinho again – if the project was right for him.</p>
