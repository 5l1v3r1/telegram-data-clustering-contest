        <b>PIERS Morgan has hailed Nicola Sturgeon as "the most natural leader in British politics".</b>
      </p>
      <p>The GMB host praised the "impressive" SNP chief for her skill in dealing with the media after her ITV interview last night.</p>

      <p>The pair often clash on Morgan's show, but he heaped compliments on Sturgeon after her telly grilling.</p>
      <p>The First Minister was excluded from the first leaders' debate - which was a head-to-head between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>But she - along with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson, Nigel Farage of the Brexit Party and Greens co-leader Sian Berry - was quizzed afterwards by host Nina Hossain.</p>

      <p>And Morgan was clearly impressed with her interview skills - even if he didn't agree with everything she said.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Without passing any judgement on the content of what she says, Nicola Sturgeon is the most natural leader in British politics.</p>
      <p>"So impressive in media interviews."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His comments racked up more than 7,700 likes and around 1,000 retweets.</p>
      <p>During her interview, Sturgeon denied a deal had already been done between the SNP and Labour, rubbishing claims by Johnson.</p>

      <p>She also repeated her claim she would not put "any Tory" into power.</p>
      <p>And Sturgeon also ruled out a coalition but said she would consider a "more informal arrangement" that included a second Scottish independence referendum next year.</p>
      <p>And when quizzed on which political leader she'd like to "spend time with" in the I'm A Celeb jungle, she joked she'd take Johnson or Farage.</p>
      <p>But only so she could “subject them to all the really gory things”.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, after a typically heated debate on GMB, the SNP leader refused to tell Morgan any naughty secrets.</p>
      <p>She told him he was "the last person on the face of the planet" she'd admit any sordid stories to.</p>
      <p>And the pair clashed on Twitter in the summer when Sturgeon defended USA World Cup winner Megan Rapinoe after Morgan blasted the footy star's "stupendous ego".</p>
