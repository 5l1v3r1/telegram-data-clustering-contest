      <h1>Old Buckingham Palace letter casts doubt on when Prince Andrew met Jeffrey Epstein</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew told Newnight's Emily Maitlis that he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999, but a letter sent to the Times in 2011 suggests otherwise</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:13:07+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A letter from Buckingham Palace written in 2011 has cast doubt on when Prince Andrew actually met his millionaire paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>In his widely criticised interview with Newnight's Emily Maitlis, the Duke said he met the convicted sex offender in 1999.</p>
      <p>However according to the BBC, a letter published in The Times eight years ago claims they met much earlier.</p>
      <p>The Duke's then private secretary Alastair Watson wrote to the newspaper to address their relationship.</p>
      <p>He wrote that the Queen's son had known Epstein "since being introduced to him in the early 1990s".</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace told Mirror Online that Andrew's words "speak for themselves".</p>

      <p>In the controversial interview, which aired on Saturday night, the prince denied an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by Epstein.</p>
      <p>However he said he did not regret their friendship. He has also been criticised for not showing compassion for his victims.</p>
      <p>According to insiders the prince hoped to draw a line under the issue, but many viewers believe it left more questions than it gave answers.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=onsite-share&amp;utm_brand=vanity-fair&amp;utm_social-type=earned">Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl</a> , he now wants to do a second chat to "put right the things he didn't say".</p>

      <p>A source said: "There are rumors swirling that Andrew wants to do another interview.</p>
      <p>"Andrew hasn’t drawn a line under it. He wants the chance to put right the things he didn’t say.</p>
      <p>"Newsnight gave him the chance to show some remorse. He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say. It was an open goal - he didn’t grasp it, and I think he sees that now."</p>
      <p>However Buckingham Palace is "not aware" that anything is in the pipeline at this point.</p>
      <p>A number of charities and organisations of which the Duke of York is a patron have declined to give details on how their relationship with Andrew might be affected following the interview he gave about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for the Foundation for Liver Research said "we don't have anything to say at the moment. It is a matter for the trustees, who will consider it in due course."</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's (NSPCC) said: "Prince Andrew was a patron of the NSPCC Full Stop Campaign, which ended in 2009."</p>
      <p>The Royal Society only said: "HRH Prince Andrew Duke of York is a Royal Fellow of the Society. He was elected in 2013."</p>
      <p>The Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust also confirmed that Andrew was a patron of the organisation, but refused to comment further.</p>
