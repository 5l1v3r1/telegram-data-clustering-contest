      <h2>Tottenham have hired Jose Mourinho as Mauricio Pochettino's replacement but had eyed Brendan Rodgers before seeking out the Special One</h2>

      <p>Brendan Rodgers was Tottenham's first choice to replace Mauricio Pochettino before turning their attention to Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was axed on Tuesday night following a poor run of form that dates back to last season.</p>
      <p>Daniel Levy decided to take the plunge and begun planning for Pochettino's replacement a month ago.</p>
      <p>But he was quickly warned off Rodgers with chiefs at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> telling Levy it would be impossible to get the Northern Irishman out of the King Power, reports the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705673/Jose-Mourinhos-arrival-month-pipeline-Spurs-manager-shock-unfolded.html">Daily Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>Rodgers has got the Foxes sitting second having impressed massively since joining from Celtic in February.</p>

      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> have hired Mourinho, a man who mentored Rodgers at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , in the hope he can end their 11 year wait for a trophy.</p>
      <p>The Special One has rejected several opportunities to get back into management having been sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> 11 months ago, but opted for Tottenham when they came calling.</p>
      <p>â€œI am excited to be joining a Club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters. The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me," said the two-time Champions League winner.</p>

      <p>Pochettino led them impressively during his tenure and allowed a host of youngsters to flourish, but had no trophies to show for his efforts.</p>
      <p>The warning signs were clear before the Argentine led the north London side out in Madrid before the Champions League final back in June.</p>
      <p>Pochettino suggested that, were Tottenham to triumph in the Wanda Metropolitano, he would walk away.</p>
      <p>They failed to lift Europe's top prize and his frustrations at the club's efforts in the summer transfer window were clear.</p>
      <p>He claimed his job title should be changed from manager to coach given his lack of influence on matters away from the training ground.</p>
      <p>It led to the complete breakdown in Pochettino's relationship with Levy and those in and around the club could tell the Argentine's interest had wained.</p>
