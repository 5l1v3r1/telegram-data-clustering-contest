      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 20 — Wall Street stocks pulled back early today on revived fears over the grinding US-China trade talks, offset somewhat by good earnings from retailers Target and Lowe’s.</p>
      <p>Investors fear another escalation of trade tensions on the lack of progress between Washington and Beijing on fleshing out a preliminary “phase one” trade agreement struck in October that halted additional trade tariffs.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, US President Donald Trump threatened to raise tariffs higher if no deal is struck.</p>
      <p>About 15 minutes into trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.2 per cent at 27,873.50.</p>
      <p>The broad-based S&amp;P 500 also fell 0.2 per cent to 3,115.03, along with the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index, which stood at 8,553.59.</p>
      <p>Major indices rose to all-time highs in recent sessions, in part due to an easing of US-China tensions that investors now may be rethinking.</p>
      <p>Another positive factor has been healthy US consumer spending, which was on display in earnings reports today.</p>
      <p>Target jumped 10.3 per cent after reporting higher third-quarter earnings on a 4.5 per cent increase in comparable store sales. The big-box retailer expressed confidence about the upcoming holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Home-improvement retailer Lowe’s gained 6.0 per cent as it also reported higher profits that it said reflected a “solid macroeconomic backdrop” that has boosted consumption. — AFP</p>
