      <h1>Rajendra Mehta: last of the ghazal stalwarts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:43:45+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Narendra-Kusnur-792/" target="_blank">Narendra Kusnur</a></address>
      <p>That was another era all together, which came alive with simplicity, poetry and romance. The ghazal wave was in full swing by the early 1980s, and besides a flood of private albums, the genre had made a mark in film music too.</p>
      <h3>In harmony</h3>
      <p>Over a decade before that, Rajendra and Nina Mehta had set the trend of ghazal-singing couples, followed later by Jagjit and Chitra Singh. Popularly known as the Musical Mehtas, they had a string of successful concerts and Doordarshan appearances. For those who witnessed that phase, Rajendra Mehta’s death on November 13 marks the end of an era. Nina Mehta passed away in 2014.</p>
      <p>The Mehtas used simple poetry and pleasant orchestrations, focusing on harmonium, santoor, acoustic guitar and tabla. They didn’t record much in the 1970s, but once the ghazal craze began, released the albums <i>Hum Safar</i>, <i>Nazrana</i>, <i>Rubaru</i> and <i>Manzar Manzar</i>, besides some live recordings.</p>
      <p>Most of the catalogue is owned by Universal Music, and available on online streaming platforms.</p>
      <p>Tips Industries did their devotional album <i>Hari-Leela</i>. Sadly, like a bulk of ghazal records from the 1980s, there is no focused industry effort to spread awareness about those gems.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, the label and streaming platforms will revive and market them through a greatest hits compilation or playlists.</p>
      <h3>Timeless ghazals</h3>
      <p>Rajendra and Nina Mehta sang many great ghazals and nazms through their illustrious career. For those who like pure melody and effective words, those songs appeal even today.</p>
      <p>Keeping that in mind, here’s a list of the ten most memorable songs by the duo, in no particular order. Rajendra Mehta always respected the writer, and said, “Without good poetry, our effort would be meaningless.” So, am including the poet’s name in each example, hoping the current generation of ghazal singers follows this practice diligently.</p>
      <p>We begin with their most famous duet ‘<i>Taj Mahal Mein Aa Jana</i>’, a beautiful nazm (using free verse) written by Prem Warbatoni. The song was a rage at one time, and evokes nostalgia today. Next comes Dr Bashir Badr’s ‘<i>Musafir Ke Raste Badalte Rahe</i>’, a Rajendra Mehta solo tune about travel and destination. Sudarshan Faakir’s nostalgic ‘<i>Ek Pyara Sa Gaon</i>’, which talks of moving from a small town to a city, comes at third position.</p>
      <p>A personal favourite is Shakeeb Banarasi's ‘<i>Sham-e-Alam Jab Dard-e-Judaai</i>’, in which the two singers coordinate beautifully. At number five, is Mumtaz Rashid’s love song ‘<i>Tum Ko Hum Dil Mein Basa Lenge</i>’.</p>
      <p>Representing two legendary poets, Jan Nisar Akhtar’s ‘<i>Fursat-e-Kaar Faqat Chaar Ghadi Hai Yaaro</i>’ and Kaifi Azmi’s ‘<i>Tum Pareshan Na Ho</i>’ follow.</p>
      <p>At number eight comes Pakistani master-writer Qateel Shifai's ‘<i>Dhal Gaya Chand Gayee Raat Chalo So Jaaen</i>’. Prem Warbatoni’s peppy and romantic ‘<i>Suna Hai Maine Yeh Jabse</i>’ and Kumar Shailendra’s touching ‘<i>Alvida Alvida Alvida</i>’ wind up this list.</p>
