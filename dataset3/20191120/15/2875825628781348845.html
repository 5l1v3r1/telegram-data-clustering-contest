      <h1>Deontay Wilder explains why he wants Andy Ruiz Jr to beat Anthony Joshua</h1>
      <h2>Deontay Wilder has a good reason to be backing Andy Ruiz Jr in his December 7 rematch with Anthony Joshua</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:58:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:58</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder is keen to see Andy Ruiz Jr win his rematch with Anthony Joshua - to make his own unification quest easier.</p>
      <p>Wilder and Joshua were long tipped to face off in a bid to bring together the heavyweight belts before Joshua lost his WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO belts on June 1.</p>
      <p>WBC king Wilder will defend his belt against Luiz Ortiz on Saturday before turning his attentions elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Whilst a rematch with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> is pencilled in for February 22, unification remains on his radar.</p>
      <p>And he admits he would prefer Ruiz to defeat Joshua due to the ease of negotiations with a boxer also under the PBC promotional stable.</p>

      <p>Wilder said: “After this fight, I’m looking forward to the rematch with Fury.</p>
      <p>“Then after I knock Fury out I’m looking forward to the winner of Joshua - Ruiz.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it’s Ruiz because if Joshua get it, I don’t think it’s going to be unification bout.</p>
      <p>“But if Ruiz get it [the win], being that we’re in the same stable, it’ll be an easier fight to make.</p>

      <p>“It’ll be the one that people say we finally have a unification in the heavyweight division and it will be <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> .”</p>
      <p>Wilder and Joshua were locked in negotiations several times.</p>
      <p>But talks between Wilder's camp and Joshua's team, led by Eddie Hearn, regularly broke down with both sides keen to point the finger.</p>

      <p>Whilst both sides have refused to rule out meeting in the future, Ruiz Jr winning the rematch would certainly increase the chances of the division being unified, provided Wilder keeps his unbeaten run going.</p>
      <p>The winner of Joshua and Ruiz Jr could have to vacate one of their belts, however, with mandatory challengers looming for the WBO and IBF straps.</p>
