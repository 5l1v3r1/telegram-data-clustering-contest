      <h1>Barcelona: The 5 dream managers for next season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:06:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:06</time> by <a rel="author">Chiranjib Ghosh</a></address>
      <h3>Barcelona is a club which has always attracted the best managerial talent</h3>
      <p>From Rinus Michels to Frank Rijkaard, Barcelona have always hired some of the best managers in the world at the peak of their powers. While some managers have been experiments of sorts (the best example being Pep Guardiola), the Blaugrana have been managed by some big names too.</p>
      <p>When Louis van Gaal was brought in from Ajax, he was among the highest-rated emerging coaches in Europe. Similarly, the appointment of Gerardo Martino was a high-profile one, considering his stature in South American football.</p>
      <p>Currently, Barça are facing what is best described as an identity crisis. The philosophy of the club has been lost in the sea of money that has been thrown at players, and the result has been a curious goulash of characterless football.</p>
      <p>Ernesto Valverde’s contract is up at the end of the season, with an option for a one-year extension. The way things are going, that option is certain to remain unused. In fact, the Basque coach could be sacked this season itself if results worsen.</p>
      <p>In any case, Barcelona will need a new manager to helm a fresh sporting project from the beginning of next season. He has to oversee an exodus, like Guardiola did when he started to rebuild the club. But more importantly, he needs to instill tiki-taka back in the ‘Barça DNA’.</p>

      <h3>Mauricio Pochettino: The young manager waiting for his big moment</h3>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino recently got sacked by Tottenham. After an extremely poor start to the season, it was not an unexpected decision on the part of Spurs chairman Daniel Levy. But his untimely departure says nothing of his tenure.</p>
      <p>The former Argentina international took Tottenham to new heights after taking over in 2014. He had just come off very successful spells at Southampton and Espanyol, and was given a batch of talented young players to groom into stardom.</p>
      <p>And Pochettino did just that. He mentored Harry Kane, Eric Dier, Harry Winks, Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen, and turned them into top-notch players. Such was the emphasis on development of English talent that many Spurs players went on to feature for the White Lions.</p>
      <p>Tactically, Pochettino converted Tottenham into a well-oiled goalscoring machine, with Kane at the helm as a main man. With a smoothly functioning 4-3-1-2 formation, Spurs played some truly awe-inspiring football up front while remaining very solid at the back.</p>
      <p>Pochettino also made some very good, economical signings in Heung-min Son, Victor Wanyama, Lucas Moura and Davinson Sánchez. These improvements, as well as the growth of academy graduates, meant that Spurs improved every season.</p>
      <p>But Spurs were never the biggest spenders compared to the rest of the big Premier League teams. In fact, they reached the Champions League final without spending a single penny on new signings due to the funding for their new stadium.</p>
      <p>This season, Pochettino has been unable to motivate his frustrated squad and that has reflected in the results. But his 5-year reign as Tottenham head coach proves that he is among the finest managers in Europe and has the ability to deliver results.</p>
      <p>At Barça, Pochettino will face no difficulty in adaptation. He knows the city of Barcelona inside out due to his time at Espanyol as a player and manager, and shown his tactical flexibility in his various coaching roles over the years.</p>
      <p>Pochettino will value La Masia more than big-name signings, which is what has been sorely lacking from recent head coaches. Although he has not been trained in the tiki-taka philosophy, Pochettino has what it takes to succeed at Barça.</p>

      <h3>Alejandro Sabella: The man who made Messi an Argentine icon</h3>
      <p>Alejandro Sabella is one of the most underrated managers of all-time. The Estudiantes legend was appointed by his former club as head coach in 2009, and delivered instant success. After leaving Estudiantes, he took over as Argentina manager.</p>
      <p>His first decision as Argentina coach was to appoint Lionel Messi as captain. The budding Barça superstar spearheaded a complete revolution in the Argentina national team. Sabella changed the way that the Albiceleste play, trying to emulate Barça.</p>
      <p>He implemented a traditional 4-3-3 formation, with Barça player Javier Mascherano in a holding role and Messi as a false nine. It worked wonders, and the buildup to the 2014 World Cup was very good compared to Argentina’s Copa América campaign.</p>
      <p>In Brazil, Sabella’s tactical setup could not be properly countered by any side and Argentina breezed through the knockouts. Even though Mario Götze’s late winner meant that Messi wouldn’t become world champion, it was no testament to Sabella’s tactics.</p>
      <p>Alejandro Sabella is the only Argentina manager who was able to get the best out of Messi on the international level. Under Sabella, Messi’s performance matched those at club level. It is clear that the two have a working relationship.</p>
      <p>Barcelona need a manager with individualism, who can bring his own personality to the football. Sabella does not roll with the punches, and that is why he is one of the best managers of the 21st century. In that way, he is similar to Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>Sabella has not taken up any coaching role since he resigned as Argentina manager after the World Cup in Brazil. But with the right offer, Barça could convince him to manage Messi again, and reach the pinnacle of club football with the maestro.</p>

      <h3>Marcelino: The rising star of La Liga</h3>
      <p>Very few managers have been able to transform good sides into title challengers, especially in a league like the La Liga. Marcelino was able to achieve that with Valencia, and his tenure culminated in a win against Barcelona of all teams.</p>
      <p>Marcelino made the step up to the big leagues with the Sevilla job. But Los Nervionsenses fired him after just a few games. But the former Spain youth international picked himself up with a very successful 3-year reign at Villarreal.</p>
      <p>A newly-promoted Villarreal finished in the top six in three seasons in a row, and Marcelino even led the Submarines to the semi-final of the Europa League. A tussle with the board eventually got him fired.</p>
      <p>At Valencia, he led a total rejuvenation. Los Che were hot on Barça’s trail for the majority of the season, and finished 4th in the end. Marcelino got the best out of Valencia’s stars, namely Dani Parejo and Rodrigo Moreno.</p>
      <p>The next season, Valencia did even better, winning the Copa del Rey. Again, it was a disagreement with the management that resulted in his sacking. But what Marcelino did at the Mestalla has made waves, and is a reason why he deserves a step further up the ladder.</p>
      <p>Under Marcelino, Valencia played some extremely entertaining football. His 4-4-2 formation was very malleable, and is adaptive to the situation. On some occasions, Valencia played in a 4-3-3 setup, with Parejo as the main playmaker and Rodrigo as the finisher.</p>
      <p>Marcelino also gave opportunities to locally-developed talent. Ferran Torres and Lee Kang-in were given their debuts by Marcelino, and Carlos Soler progressed to the first-team. He also made some very good signings, like Gonçalo Guedes and Neto.</p>
      <p>Valencia often relied on quick, agile players to make the breakthrough up front. Physically imposing midfielders like Geoffrey Kondogbia broke up counter-attacks, and released wing-backs José Gayà and Daniel Wass.</p>
      <p>This may not be a perfect analogy for a Barça side, but it can certainly fit the club’s philosophy as Marcelino does possess the tactical know-how. He can bring a more counter-attacking flair to the Barça game, and tighten up the defensive side of things too.</p>
      <p>Like Valverde, it would be unsure whether Marcelino was ready for the step up. But it hasn’t worked with Valverde, and that remains a precedent. But Marcelino is always a better bet than the Basque coach.</p>

      <h3>Massimiliano Allegri: The Italian tactical mastermind</h3>
      <p>Massimiliano Allegri will move out of Italy in his next job. As a player and manager, the wily ex-Juventus head coach has spent his entire career in the Mediterranean peninsula, but his talents have global appeal and huge potential.</p>
      <p>Allegri’s slowly nurtured reputation earned him an appointment at AC Milan in 2010, after a spell in charge of Cagliari. At Milan, he propelled himself into the big leagues of European football by winning the domestic double in his first season.</p>
      <p>With the big players leaving and club legends retiring, Milan slipped into a depression under Allegri. He was eventually sacked in 2014, after 3 trophyless seasons. But then, Juventus came calling and Allegri was set for a stint of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>Allegri won the domestic double in his very first season, coming achingly close to a treble after being beaten in the Champions League final by Barça. He followed it up with three more domestic doubles, and another Champions League final appearance.</p>
      <p>But he left at the end of last season, with the Old Lady failing to win the Coppa Italia. Nevertheless, Massimiliano Allegri left an indelible mark on Juventus, as the Bianconeri enjoyed the most successful period in their history, albeit without European success.</p>
      <p>Allegri had to live up to high expectations upon his arrival in Turin. Antonio Conte had been very successful, and built a formidable squad. But he didn’t persist with his predecessor’s tactics, setting up his own methods in the tactical setup.</p>
      <p>Allegri’s teams were often possession-based, and relied on slow, but steady build-up play to find the back of the net. As with any Italian side, Juventus were extremely tight at the back. But the 5-man defence was often done away with.</p>
      <p>Most frequently, Juventus played with a different, more attacking touch in Europe. Thus, Allegri segregated the tactical needs of the league and the Champions League. That is the reason for their continued success on both fronts.</p>
      <p>Juventus did not play very entertaining or attacking football under Allegri, but what they did, they did efficiently. Players were not confined to their roles, and both creative players had a free hand in every single match. There was overall structure, but individual fluidity.</p>
      <p>Also, Allegri made some very good signings as Juventus manager. Europe’s elite are known for failed big-money transfers. But that is not the case for the Old Lady, whose big signings have all eventually worked out, one way or another.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the best signings made under Allegri’s watch were not high-profile. The moves for Wojciech Szczęsny, Sami Khedira and Rodrigo Bentancur have been the best. And they cost a total of under €30 million.</p>
      <p>All of these attributes make Allegri a very good fit for Barcelona. He has the ability to adapt, and stamp his authority on a club. With the adaptability and the tactical prowess, Massimiliano Allegri has the ability to take Barça to greater heights.</p>

      <h3>Ronald Koeman: Johan Cruyff’s more pragmatic protégé</h3>
      <p>Ronald Koeman was part of Johan Cruyff’s ‘Dream Team’ at Barcelona. He played alongside Barça’s most successful manager under Barça’s most iconic manager. It is only right for Koeman to become Barça head coach at one point in his long managerial career.</p>
      <p>Koeman is a Barça legend, to say the very least. He netted the goal which saw Barça lift its first-ever European Cup. Moreover, he was the set-piece expert for Cruyff’s team and won 7 major trophies with the club.</p>
      <p>He even returned 3 years later, as assistant to fellow Dutchman Louis van Gaal. As part of the coaching setup alongside the likes of José Mourinho, he built up a good reputation for himself. Eventually, Koeman moved on to coach in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Apart from short spells in Portugal and Spain, Koeman spent a decade coaching in the Netherlands. He won 3 Eredivisie titles, and one KNVB Cup, with the greatest success coming at Ajax. Then, he moved to England.</p>
      <p>Replacing Mauricio Pochettino at Southampton, Koeman did wonders. He built on the momentum created by Pochettino, recruiting good players and building a squad. He led Southampton to consistently good league finishes, with some entertaining football along the way.</p>
      <p>His subsequent spell in charge of Everton was a failure, but Koeman has picked himself up as Netherlands head coach. He has overseen a rejuvenation of the Oranje, developing great young players in Matthijs de Ligt, Steven Bergwijn and Frenkie de Jong.</p>
      <p>Ronald Koeman’s success as a manager has come when he has employed tactics different to his own footballing background. But as Netherlands manager, he has gone back to his roots and employed a possession-based tactical setup.</p>
      <p>As a result, a previously dormant and ageing Holland side have been able to beat the likes of France and Germany multiple times. They even finished runners-up in the recently-concluded UEFA Nations League.</p>
      <p>Koeman has adopted a pragmatic approach throughout his managerial career, perhaps due to the influence of Van Gaal. In that way, he is similar to Mourinho. He takes it one-game-at-a-time, and it has paid dividends under pressure situations.</p>
      <p>The ex-Culé is a highly experienced, and very talented manager. He hasn’t had the opportunity to really make it big in European football, but has done more than prove his mettle with smaller clubs who have limited resources.</p>
      <p>Barça could the club which propels Koeman to stardom as a manager, after it did as a player.</p>
