      <h1>ESPN Analyst Unveils Score Prediction For Ohio State-Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:36:18+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the third College Football Playoff rankings of the 2019 season were released. LSU maintained the top spot with a win over Ole Miss this weekend while Ohio State held down the No. 2 spot.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes steamrolled Rutgers last weekend, but failed to cover the ridiculous spread.</p>
      <p>After an easy contest against the Scarlet Knights, Ryan Day and company welcome their most difficult test of the season so far. No. 8 Penn State comes to town for a massive Big Ten showdown. Ohio State enters as an 18-point favorite.</p>
      <p>Before the game kicks off, ESPN analyst Bill Connelly made his score prediction for the game.</p>
      <p>He likes the Buckeyes to win, but not cover the spread.</p>
      <h3>ESPN’s final score prediction for the Ohio State-Penn State game has the Buckeyes winning, 34-20.</h3>

      <p>Ohio State is easily one of the best programs in the country. The Buckeyes sit in top-five in total offense and defense, the only program to boast such a claim.</p>
      <p>Penn State’s defense looked legit to start the season, but has fallen off over the past two games. The Nittany Lions have struggled to defend the pass over the past two weeks, allowing over 300 yards passing to both Minnesota and Indiana in consecutive weeks.</p>
      <p>Can they hold up against Ohio State this weekend?</p>
