      <p>A trial involving two teenagers accused of offences linked to an alleged sexual assault at a Belfast shopping centre was halted today.</p>
      <p>The hearing at Belfast Crown Court began earlier this week, but the jury was discharged by the trial judge after it emerged there was a possibility of 'more potential material' regarding CCTV.</p>
      <p>The two defendants were charged with offences against a 25-year old woman, with the Crown's case that she was sexually assaulted in the Victoria Square shopping centre in the early hours of September 28 last year.</p>
      <p>One of the teenagers was charged with two counts of oral rape, two charges of attempted oral rape and seven of indecent assault, while his co-accused was accused of aiding and abetting him.</p>
      <p>The pair denied all charged levelled against them.</p>
      <p>On the second day of the hearing, Judge Neil Rafferty said: "It is with the deepest of regret that I am going to have to discharge this jury, which means that the trial will cease at this point and will resume again with a fresh jury."</p>
      <p>He spoke of CCTV footage in the case and revealed there was "more potential material" and that as a result he was "very reluctantly" discharging the jury.</p>
      <p>The trial is due to be re-listed again in the new year.</p>
