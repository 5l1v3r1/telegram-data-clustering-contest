      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Prithviraj Chavan said a stable government will be formed in Maharashtra soon</li>
        <li>Chavan's statement came after a crucial meeting between senior Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)</li>
        <li>NCP's Nawab Malik said best efforts are being put in to resolve all issues</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Senior Congress leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said a stable government will be formed in Maharashtra soon after a key meeting in Delhi.</p>
      <p>"Congress-NCP has had long and positive discussions today. Discussions will continue; I am sure we will be able to give a stable govt to Maharashtra very soon," he said.</p>
      <p>Chavan's statement came after a crucial meeting between senior Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders on Wednesday. The meeting was called to discuss the blueprint for common minimum programme, which is a document outlining the minimum objectives of a coalition government in the country.</p>
      <p>Several key members of both parties including Mallikarjun Kharge, KC Venugopal, Ahmed Patel, Jairam Ramesh, Prithviraj Chavan, Naseem Khan, Sharad Pawar, Ajit Pawar, Supriya Sule, and Sunil Tatkare were a part of the meeting.</p>
      <p>It seems that the stalemate over government formation in Maharashtra is likely to end soon as Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi has already given a nod to form an alliance with Shiv Sena. Reports indicate that she had given a go-ahead for an alliance with Shiv Sena during her meeting with NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Monday.</p>
      <p>Addressing the media, Chavan also said another meeting will be held between senior leaders of NCP and Congress tomorrow to discuss further issues related to government formation.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, NCP's Nawab Malik said all the three parties have to come together for government formation in Maharashtra and added that best efforts are being put in to resolve all issues.</p>
      <p>"Congress-NCP together decided that we must give an alternate govt in Maharashtra. It is not possible without NCP-Congress-Shiv Sena coming together. We are trying our best to resolve all issues. We will provide alternate govt as soon as possible," Malik said.</p>
