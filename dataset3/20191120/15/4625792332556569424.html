      <p>House Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes compared the nation's first president to President Trump, alleging that the current Democratic Party would have tried to impeach George Washington for his foreign policy decisions.</p>
      <p>Nunes, 46, made the remark during his opening statement on Wednesday during U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's public impeachment testimony.</p>
      <p>"This impeachment is not helping the American people, it’s not a legitimate use of taxpayer dollars, and it’s definitely not improving our national security. Finally, the Democrats’ fake outrage that President Trump used his own channel to communicate with Ukraine," Nunes stated. "I’ll remind my friends on the other side of the aisle that our first president George Washington directed his own diplomatic channels to secure a treaty with Great Britain."</p>
      <p>He added, "If my Democratic colleagues were around in 1794, they probably would want to impeach him, too."</p>
      <p>Sondland, a former Trump donor, is now one of the most important people in the House impeachment investigation. The House is investigating whether or not the president abused the power of the Oval Office by trying to influence a foreign entity to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>Sondland <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-trumps-ukraine-crowdstrike-conspiracy-theory-front-and-center-in-impeachment-hearing">testified that the aid would not be given</a> until the Ukrainian government publicly announced the investigation into Biden and the 2016 <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/analysis-trumps-ukraine-crowdstrike-conspiracy-theory-front-and-center-in-impeachment-hearing">CrowdStrike conspiracy theory</a>.</p>
