      <p><b>PROVIDENCE, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - The city of Providence will soon start regulating short-term housing rentals, including those booked through Airbnb.</p>
      <p>The Providence Department of Planning and Development says a zoning ordinance regulating rentals takes effect Nov. 30.</p>
      <p>A short-term rental is a property rented for 28 consecutive days or less.</p>
      <p>The ordinance will require homeowners to obtain temporary use permits from the city before renting their property. There is no fee to obtain a permit.</p>
      <p>The City Council passed the ordinance in May.</p>
      <p>Head of Northeast Policy for Airbnb, Josh Meltzer, said the company is concerned the ordinance might financially hurt Airbnb hosts.</p>
      <p>City Councilwoman Nirva LaFortune said people should have the right to rent out their homes but "not at the cost of our neighbors' quality of life."</p>
