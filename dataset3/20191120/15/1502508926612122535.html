      <h2>The appellate is hearing some other matters related to Ruchi Soya, which are slated to be heard on December 9</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has extended till December 16 the deadline for completion of Patanjali Ayurved's Rs 4,350 crore resolution plan to acquire debt-ridden edible oil firm <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ruchi-soya">Ruchi Soya.</a></p>
      <p>Earlier, the deadline for implementation of the resolution plan for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ruchi-soya">Ruchi Soya </a>was November 21.</p>
      <p>In September this year, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/patanjali-ayurved">Patanjali Ayurved </a>had received approval of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to acquire Ruchi Soya, which went into an insolvency in December 2017.</p>
      <p>NCLT had admitted the insolvency plea filed by two lead financial creditors Standard Chartered Bank and DBS Bank. However, later the Singapore-based DBS Bank became dissenting creditor and approached <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nclat">NCLAT </a>challenging the distribution of proceeds from the bid submitted by Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurveda.</p>
      <p>The appellate tribunal this week dismissed DSB Bank's plea, stating that a secured creditor cannot dissent with the resolution plan just to get more funds than other creditors and claim preference over other creditors.</p>
      <p>"In the view of the fact that this appellate tribunal would take up the matter on December 9, we extend the period of implementation up to December 16, 2019," the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/nclat">NCLAT </a>said.</p>
      <p>The appellate is hearing some other matters related to Ruchi Soya, which are slated to be heard on December 9.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/ruchi-soya">Ruchi Soya </a>informed the tribunal that resolution applicant Patanjali group will infuse Rs 204.75 crore as equity and Rs 3,233.36 crore as debt.</p>
      <p>The amount will be infused in a special purpose vehicle (SPV) 'Patanjali Consortium Adhigrahan Pvt Ltd', which will be later amalgamated with Ruchi Soya.</p>
      <p>Another Rs 900 crore will be infused by the Patanjali group through subscription of non-convertible debentures and preference shares in the SPV. It will also provide credit guarantee of nearly Rs 12 crore.</p>
      <p>On April 30 this year, a committee of creditors had approved Patanjali group's Rs 4,350 crore resolution plan to take over Ruchi Soya. Lenders will have to take a haircut of around 60 per cent.</p>
      <p>Shailendra Ajmera of EY was appointed as Resolution Professional (RP) to manage the company's affairs and conduct insolvency proceedings.</p>
