      <p><i>Late Night </i>host Seth Meyers joked with former Vice President Al Gore that he should join the already crowded field of Democrats in the 2020 presidential primary.</p>
      <p>"Very crowded Democratic field," Meyers told Gore Tuesday night on his show. "Some people getting in late, Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Deval Patrick. Now's your chance."</p>
      <p>"Looks like fun," Gore joked, adding that he does not want to be a politician again. "I'm a recovering politician. But the longer I go without a relapse, the less likely one becomes."</p>
      <p>"We wish you the best of luck in your recovery," Meyers said before asking Gore his thoughts on the House's impeachment proceedings. The former Democratic presidential nominee said he believes the public impeachment hearings are so far "having an impact."</p>
      <p>The House is in the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-intelligence-committee-holds-impeachment-hearing-featuring-gordon-sondland">middle of the second week</a> of public hearings. Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testified Wednesday that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/sondland-was-there-a-quid-pro-quo-the-answer-is-yes">there was a quid pro quo</a> with President Trump and Ukraine.</p>

      <p>Gore <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/United-States-presidential-election-of-2000">previously ran</a> for president in 2000 but lost to former President George W. Bush in a narrow election that produced no clear winner on election night. After a state-wide recount in Florida, Gore won the popular vote but failed to secure enough electoral college votes to win.</p>
