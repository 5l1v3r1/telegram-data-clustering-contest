      <p>Animal welfare experts are appealing to find a new home for lovable Lucy, a German Shepherd cross who is currently under the care of Dogs Trust’s West Calder Rehoming Centre.</p>
      <p>Lucy is just one year old and she is a bubbly girl who adores getting attention.</p>
      <p>Her carers say Lucy is a very sweet and friendly girl who loves to make new friends and is at her most content when she’s in the company of her favourite people.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Dogs Trust said: “An active youngster, Lucy is full of energy and enthusiasm and she loves to set off for walks where she can explore. Lucy has a great time running around the garden with her favourite toys and adores playing a game of fetch with her favourite teddies.</p>
      <p>"Lucy is a big bouncy girl who needs active owners who have experience with similar breeds and can manage her size. Lucy is looking for someone who can be at home throughout the day to keep her company and continue with her training. Lucy has not had a lot of contact with other dogs and can be overwhelmed in a busy environment and so is searching for a quiet rural home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Lucy would be happy living with children aged around 14 years old and above. With her lovable personality, Lucy is sure to bring a lot of love and joy into her future home.”</p>
      <p>If you think you could provide the perfect home for Lucy, or any of the other 50 dogs currently available for rehoming, please contact the centre on 01506 873459.</p>
      <p>You can also follow Dogs Trust West Calder on Twitter @DT_WestCalder for regular updates on events and dogs available for rehoming.</p>
      <p>Dogs Trust West Calder will be holding their visit Santa Paws’ Grotto and Christmas Fair on Sunday, December 1.</p>
