      <h1>Billie Eilish, Bon Iver, Lizzo, Lil Nas X Featuring Billy Ray Cyrus And More Get A Grammy Nomination For Record Of The Year</h1>

      <p>The 2020 Grammy nominations were announced on Wednesday morning and people are sounding off over the nominees for Record of the Year. Many people confuse Record of the Year with the Best Song category. The difference is simple as Record of the Year honors and recognizes the performer while the Best Song Grammy award gives recognition to the songwriters who wrote the song.</p>
      <p>Record of the Year goes to the artist who performed the song as well as the producers, recording engineers and mixers but not the songwriter.</p>
      <p>There are eight nominees for the 2020 Grammy’s Record of the Year category.</p>
      <p>This year’s nominees for record of the year are as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>“Bad Guy” by Billie Eilish</li>
        <li>“Old Town Road by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus</li>
        <li>“Hey, Ma” by Bon Iver</li>
        <li>“7 Rings” by Ariana Grande</li>
        <li>“Hard Place” by H.E.R.</li>
        <li>“Talk” by Khalid</li>
        <li>“Sunflower” by Post Malone and Swae Lee</li>
        <li>“Truth Hurts” by Lizzo</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There’s a lot of talk on social media as people respond to the nominations and many are saying that the Grammy may end up going to Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus for “Old Town Road.”</p>
      <p>“Old Town Road” became something of a cultural movement and stirred controversy regarding what makes country music and what is trap music. At one point, Lil Nas X was kicked off the Billboard charts under the country music category and then Billy Ray Cyrus teamed up with him. After the collaboration, Lil Nas X was right back on the charts and the song dominated charts for months.</p>
      <p>Because of the fight to get the song out there combined with the public’s response to ensuring “Old Town Road”</p>
