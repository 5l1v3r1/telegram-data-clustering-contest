      <h2>The mood in markets soured after the US Senate angered China by passing a bill requiring annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy and warning Beijing against suppressing protesters</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:52:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:52</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/world-stocks">World stocks </a>were knocked off 22-month highs on Wednesday as a flare-up in Sino-US tensions and the creeping return of US recession fears fuelled a bid for bonds and other "safe" assets such as gold.</p>
      <p>Wall Street futures were marked lower and European equities tumbled 0.8%, edging further off recent four-year highs hit when it had appeared Washington and Beijing were about to agree the first phase of a trade deal.</p>
      <p>The mood in markets soured after the US Senate angered China by passing a bill requiring annual certification of Hong Kong's autonomy and warning Beijing against suppressing protesters. China demanded the United States stop interfering in its internal affairs and said it would retaliate.</p>
      <p>US President Donald Trump also threatened to up tariffs on Chinese goods if a trade deal is not reached soon.</p>
      <p>"Markets have taken a bit of a wobble due to the talk about Hong Kong, but they had rallied a lot in recent weeks on expectations of a (trade) deal," said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier.</p>
      <p>Ahmed said both sides needed a deal to be signed -- Trump cannot afford a recession because of his re-election bid next year, while China's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-economy-1160102.htm">economy </a>is slowing markedly.</p>
      <p>"I think we are looking at a short-term setback rather than a major issue that would derail the process. The bill still has to be signed into law by Trump so there's a high probability he will use it as leverage against China."</p>
      <p>MSCI's index of Asia-Pacific shares ex-Japan tumbled 0.7%, Japan's Nikkei fell 0.8% and Shanghai blue chips lost 1%. MSCI's global index slipped 0.3%, ending a three-day winning streak.</p>
      <p>Wall Street futures were down 0.3%-0.4%</p>
      <p>Analysts noted through that U.S. shares had closed just below record highs on Tuesday, and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/world-stocks">world stocks </a>are 0.5% off all-time peaks hit last year.</p>
      <p>"It was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable, suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook," ANZ told clients.</p>
      <p>U.S. 10-year Treasury yields, which have fallen in six out of the past seven sessions, slipped as much as 5 basis points to 1.73%, a 2-1/2 -week low .=rr&gt;</p>
      <p>German bonds fell for the third straight day to touch a 2-1/2 week low , shrugging off European Central Bank Chief Economist Philip Lane's comment that the euro zone <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-economy-1160102.htm">economy </a>would not fall into a recession. =rr&gt;</p>
      <p>"We have this classical risk-off trade taking place again," Rainer Guntermann, a rates strategist at Commerzbank, said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>THE R WORD</b>
      </p>
      <p>Commodity and bond market moves imply fears of economic recession may be creeping back with Brent crude steadying after a 2.6% tumble, its biggest in seven weeks .</p>
      <p>Japan's October exports fanned these fears, falling at their quickest rate in three years while China cut lending rates to support growth which is near 30-year lows.</p>
      <p>A marked flattening of the U.S. bond curve -- the gap between two-year and 10-year yields is at its narrowest in more than two weeks -- also hints at a return of recession fears.</p>
      <p>The curve inverted earlier this year, returning to normal only after three U.S. interest rate cuts.</p>
      <p>But Federal Reserve officials have hinted there will be no further easing for now, a message the U.S. central bank may reiterate later in the day when it releases minutes from its last meeting. Markets are now pricing in just a 0.8% chance of a December rate cut .</p>
      <p>Dour forecasts from retailers Home Depot and Kohl's also fuelled worries about U.S. consumer spending, which has so far been robust, in contrast to manufacturing.</p>
      <p>"We've had a bit of topping out of the U.S. consumer in the past couple of months," Lombard Odier's Ahmed said.</p>
      <p>On currencies, the dollar nudged lower versus the yen to 108.4 but firmed 0.2% versus a basket of currencies &lt;.DXY&gt;. Sterling slipped 0.3%, pressured by dollar strength and a better-than-expected performance by left-wing opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn in pre-election TV debates.=&gt;</p>
      <p>But sterling and UK domestic stocks &lt;.FTMC&gt; remain supported by opinion polls showing a hefty lead for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's ruling Conservatives, viewed by some as more market-friendly.</p>
      <p>If the Conservatives win a majority on Dec. 12, expectations are parliament would approve the Brexit deal Johnson agreed with Brussels last month and Britain would exit the European Union on Jan. 31, ending three-and-a-half years of uncertainty.</p>
