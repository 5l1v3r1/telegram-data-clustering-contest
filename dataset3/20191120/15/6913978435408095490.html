      <p><b>TEHRAN — </b>Iranian President Hassan Rohani said on ednesday the country's people had defeated an "enemy conspiracy" behind a wave of violent street protests and were celebrating their victory.<br/><br/>He blamed the days of unrest on "armed anarchists" who took to the streets "based on a plot enemies of Iran had hatched.<br/><br/>The demonstrations erupted in the sanctions-hit Islamic republic on Friday after an announcement the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200 percent with immediate effect.<br/><br/>Motorists blocked major roads in Tehran before the unrest spread rapidly to at least 40 urban centers, with petrol pumps torched, police stations attacked and shops looted.<br/><br/>Officials have confirmed five deaths, including of three security personnel stabbed by "rioters".<br/><br/>Thousands of mourners chanted "Death to America" at the funeral procession on Wednesday for one of those killed, a Revolutionary Guard commander, in Shahriar, west of Tehran.<br/><br/>The UN has voiced alarm at reports of dozens of deaths, and Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed.<br/><br/>The London-based rights group added that "the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed".<br/><br/>The full extent of the bloodshed was difficult to ascertain given a near-total internet blackout now in its fourth day.<br/><br/>Rohani told a Cabinet meeting that "our people have been victorious against... the enemy's conspiracy.<br/><br/>"Those anarchists who came out to the streets were few in number," he said, insisting that "this is the biggest display of the power of the nation of Iran."<br/><br/>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had said earlier also that "the recent actions were security issues, not from the people.<br/><br/>"We have repelled the enemy."<br/><br/>Days ago Khamenei had blamed foreign opponents of Iran's establishment for the unrest — among them the Pahlavi royal family ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the People's Mujahedeen of Iran group, which Iran considers a "terrorist" cult.<br/><br/>At the funeral in Shahriar, mourners marched behind a truck carrying his coffin, clutching portraits of the slain Guard as well as posters that read "Down With USA".<br/><br/>As they marched, they passed buildings gutted by fire, including a bank, post office and shopping center.<br/><br/>Morteza Ebrahimi was one of three security personnel who officials say was killed by "rioters" wielding knives and machetes.<br/><br/>The others were members of the Basij, a militia loyal to Iran's establishment.<br/><br/>State television, which rarely shows any signs of dissent in Iran, again aired footage on Tuesday night of the unrest in cities including Tehran and Shiraz.<br/><br/>The UN human rights office on Tuesday said it was alarmed by reports live ammunition had been used against protesters and caused a "significant number of deaths".<br/><br/>But spokesman Rupert Colville cautioned that casualty details were hard to verify, in part because of internet restrictions.<br/><br/>"We urge the Iranian authorities and security forces to avoid the use of force to disperse peaceful assemblies," he said.<br/><br/>Colville also called on protesters to demonstrate peacefully, "without resorting to physical violence or destruction of property".<br/><br/>Iran's economy has been battered since May last year when President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions.<br/><br/>Tensions have soared this year, with the US widening its sanctions to include Khamenei, the Guards and other key entities as Iran scaled back its nuclear commitments.<br/><br/>The arch-foes came to the brink of a military confrontation in June when Iran downed a US drone and Trump ordered retaliatory strikes before cancelling them at the last minute.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, the US aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln sailed through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway separating Iran and the United Arab Emirates.<br/><br/>Iran, which controls much of the strategic waterway, regularly threatens to shut it down if its enemies commit hostile acts.<br/><br/>Last week's surprise fuel price hike was agreed by an economic council made up of the president, parliament speaker and judiciary chief.<br/><br/>Rohani has defended the move, pledging its proceeds would go to the needy.<br/><br/>In his remarks on Wednesday, he said the first payments had been made to more than seven million Iranians, and that in total 18 million people would get handouts by Saturday. — AFP</p>
