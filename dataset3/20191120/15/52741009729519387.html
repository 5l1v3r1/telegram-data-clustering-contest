      <p>MISSISSAUGA, Ont. — A man has died after an officer used a stun gun on him west of Toronto, police said Wednesday, prompting Ontario's police watchdog to launch an investigation.</p>
      <p>Peel Regional Police said they were called to a home in Mississauga, Ont., around 3 a.m. for reports of a suspicious person in the area.</p>
      <p>Const. Akhil Mooken said the officers found a man in a backyard.</p>
      <p>"Officers located the male and had an interaction, at which point a conducted energy weapon was deployed," Mooken told reporters at the scene.</p>
      <p>He said the man was taken to a local hospital, where he died shortly after 4 a.m.</p>
      <p>The Special Investigations Unit, a civilian agency that looks into cases where there is a death, injury or allegation of sexual assault involving police, has invoked its mandate.</p>
      <p>This is the second stun-gun death in Mississauga in recent months.</p>
      <p>The SIU is also investigating the death of a 34-year-old man who died after police used a stun gun on him on Sept. 10.</p>
      <p>In that case, the watchdog said Peel police officers responded to a domestic call in the Malton area around 9 p.m.</p>
      <p>The SIU said the "officers became involved in an interaction with a man which involved the use of a conducted energy weapon."</p>
      <p>The agency said the man stopped breathing, his heart stopped beating and he was later pronounced dead in hospital.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 20, 2019.</p>
