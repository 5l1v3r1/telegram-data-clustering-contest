        <b>A large fire has destroyed over a dozen shops at the New Rajdhani Super Market in Dhaka’s Tikatuli before the firefighters brought it under control.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As many as 25 units of the Fire Service and Civil Defence tamed the fire around 6:45pm on Wednesday after over one and a half hours of frantic efforts, Dilip Kumar Ghosh, a fire service deputy director, told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>The fire was reported on the first floor of the two-storey tin-roofed market around 5:15pm, he said.</p>

      <p>Fire service Director General Sazzad Hussain told the media at the site that the fire completely destroyed some 15 shops of undergarments.</p>
      <p>Officials said the firefighters were dumping the burnt goods in the evening.</p>
      <p>There have been no reports of casualties so far.</p>
      <p>The authorities were yet to assess the extent of the damage and find out the origin of the fire.</p>

      <p>After the Rajdhani Super Market was established in 1995, the New Rajdhani Super Market was set up on a land next to the old market.</p>
      <p>Panicked traders and customers came out when smoke was seen billowing from the east side of the market in the afternoon, Wari Police Station Inspector Mostafizur Rahman said.</p>
      <p>“The smoke could be seen from quite far away,” he said.</p>
      <p>Abu Taher, the owner of Al Maher Jewellers, said his shop was among 43 jewellery shops on the ground floor.</p>

      <p>“Many managed to just get out and shutter down, but could not lock the shops,” he said.</p>
      <p>He believes the fire originated in the centre of the market where shops of readymade garments, tailors, foam mattress, toys, food and cosmetics are housed.</p>
      <p>The jewellers started guarding their shops after the fire was tamed. Plainclothesmen were also there, Wari Police Station OC Azizur Rahman said.</p>
      <p>Police managed the crowds of onlookers after closing the streets to the market.</p>
