        <b>The Minister for Infrastructure on Wednesday called for the end of the national sport that is the "stop-start" of infrastructure projects.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"We need infrastructure, such as airports, railways, roads and seaports so that the country can continue to develop and we can all live better. We must cherish this infrastructure and continue to develop it. And put an end to a national sport of “stop-start”, that has characterised the Portuguese past and is bad", said Pedro Nuno Santos.</p>
      <p>"When we take decisions, we take them, establish them and then we have to execute them", added the Minister of Infrastructure and Housing, in declarations to journalists in the Port of Leixões, municipality of Matosinhos, district of Porto.</p>
      <p>The governor also noted that it was necessary to resolve the delays in public works, many of which were justified by a construction sector that was "very badly affected" by the crisis", losing "size and responsiveness".</p>
