      <p>An extreme body trainer, Sajad Gharibi, better known as the Iranian Hulk due to his rare physique, is set to participate in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship.</p>
      <p>The Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship is an American bare-knuckle boxing promotion based in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>It is the first promotion to hold an official state sanctioned and commissioned bare-knuckle boxing event in America since 1889; and its first event was held in 2018, with five events held as of April 2019, says the BKFC website.</p>
      <p>The BKFC president, David Feldman, said of Gharibi: “This guy’s going to make his Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship debut in early 2020.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to do a show entitled ‘USA vs. Iran: World War III.’</p>
      <p>“He’s literally our biggest signing we’ve ever had.</p>
      <p>“But he’s going to make his way over to Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, he’s gonna make a home here, and we expect really, really big things from the Iranian Hulk,” Feldman said.</p>

      <p>Gharibi, who currently weighs 175kg, gained fame in 2016 not only for his bizarre behemoth build but because he vowed to join the fight against terrorists in Syria.</p>
      <p>His Instagram, which has 467,000 followers, is the place where he shows off his muscles and lifts more than his own body weight.</p>
