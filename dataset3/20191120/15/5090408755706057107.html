      <p>On Tuesday, the musician attended a screening of her upcoming holiday special, “The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show,” in New York City. She debuted a new hairstyle on the pink, snow-covered carpet, and also wore a stunning ensemble.</p>
      <p>Her long black hair, styled by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/giovannidelgado/">Giovanni Delgado</a>, now includes wispy bangs.</p>

      <p>Musgraves’ hair wasn’t the only standout feature of her look. She also wore a stunning two-piece ensemble from Georgian designer David Koma. Her long-sleeved crop top was embellished with jewel fringe, as was her matching miniskirt. The set is currently available for pre-order, with the top <a href="https://www.fwrd.com/product-david-koma-crystal-chain-long-sleeve-empire-top/DAVF-WS38/?d=Womens">retailing for $955</a>, and the skirt <a href="https://www.fwrd.com/product-david-koma-crystal-chain-mini-skirt/DAVF-WQ26/?d=Womens&amp;amp;pdpsrc=sw&amp;amp;sectionURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fwrd.com%2Fbrand-david-koma%2F229b99%2F">costing $885</a>.</p>
      <p>The musician also carried a Judith Leiber Couture clutch, and wore a <a href="https://stellaluna.co/ss19/crystal-xxl-chain/crystal-xxl-chain-105-sandal-2">$586 pair of Stella Luna heels</a>, which looked like they were made from diamond chains.</p>

      <p>While it’s unclear if Musgraves wore clip-in bangs or got a haircut prior to the event, she did wear drastically different hair to the CMA Awards in Nashville, Tennessee, on November 13.</p>
      <p>She <a href="https://www.insider.com/kacey-musgraves-gigi-hadid-country-music-awards-2019-11">attended the event with model Gigi Hadid</a>, and wore her signature long locks with a part down the middle.</p>
