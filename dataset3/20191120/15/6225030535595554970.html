      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Complexity_2">Complexity</a></b> won for the first time in more than a year Wednesday when galloping to victory in Aqueduct’s allowance optional claiming feature, signaling the 3-year-old is ready for stakes company again.</p>
      <p>A son of Maclean’s Music trained by Chad Brown, Complexity began his career 2-for-2 last season, breaking his maiden at Saratoga before a commanding performance in taking Belmont Park’s Champagne Stakes (G1) over, among others, Code of Honor.</p>
      <p>The Klaravich Stables colt found the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile a bit long, finishing 10th in 2018 at Churchill Downs, and due to physical setbacks wasn’t seen again until running last of 11 in the June 8 Woody Stephens (G1) at Belmont.</p>
      <p>There Daily Racing Form reported Complexity exited that race with a quarter crack necessitating more time off. As is so often the case with Brown-trained runners for Klaravich, patience began to be rewarded Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Under jockey Jose Ortiz, Complexity settled off a pair of pace setters, who went the opening quarter mile of a seven-furlong race in 22.83 seconds. Toward the half-mile pole, Complexity ranged up outside of Aristocrativ and Mr. Dougie Fresh as they went in 45.90.</p>
      <p>Ortiz took a peek behind at the top of the stretch, used a few taps of the whip and had Complexity geared down under the wire, with the clock stopping in 1:22.59.</p>
      <p>A $375,000 yearling purchase, Complexity could be a fit for a number of upcoming stakes, including Santa Anita Park’s Malibu (G1) expected to be scheduled on opening day, Dec. 26. Last year, Klaravich Stables’ Identity Politics ran second to McKinzie in the 7/8-mile feature restricted to 3-year-olds.</p>
      <p>Complexity's return effort registered a 101 Beyer Speed Figure.</p>
