      <p>Police in San Luis Rio Colorado are investigating the presumed <a href="https://zetatijuana.com/2019/11/uno-de-los-salazar-presuntamente-entre-las-victimas-de-balacera-en-slrc/">cartel attack</a> on the shop a short distance from the international border crossing into Arizona, according to local reports. Officials presume the hit team stormed the business and immediately opened fire–killing two with a third dying at a local hospital. A fourth victim sustained severe gunshot wounds and is receiving medical care.</p>
      <p>During the ensuing investigation, police discovered two AK-47s, four pistols, an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade launcher), four radios, tactical equipment, $96,000 pesos (nearly $5,000 USD), and methamphetamine, according to the Sonora state attorney general’s office. The cartel hitmen reportedly arrived in a dark sedan and left .223 caliber shell casings scattered at the scene. Investigators also located two stolen vehicles inside the shop; one was reported taken in San Diego, California, and the second from Yuma, Arizona.</p>
      <p>According to local media reports and Breitbart Texas law enforcement sources, the victims allegedly were operatives for a cell of the Sinaloa Cartel known as “Los Salazar.” Authorities <a href="https://zetatijuana.com/2019/11/confirman-muerte-de-lugarteniente-de-los-salazar-en-slrc-identifican-a-victimas/">identified</a> the three deceased as Alberto Félix Castro, 29; Ricardo Humberto Borboa Villalobos, 33; and Guillermo Saavedra “El Chester” Burboa, 34. Investigators identified El Chester as a high-ranking regional member of Los Salazar. Sources say the attack is likely the result of Sinaloa Cartel infighting.</p>
      <p>In September, a key Sinaloa Cartel operative <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/border/2019/09/07/key-cartel-operatives-murder-near-arizona-border-sparks-fears-of-escalated-violence/">was gunned down</a> on the outskirts of a rural community in Valle de Mexicali near Arizona. Police identified one of the victims as Julio César Aguilar García, aka “El Vaquero,” a key regional member linked to Ismael Zambada García “El Mayo,” the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel. A second victim was Rodolfo Antonio Galindo, aka “El Chupacabra.”</p>
