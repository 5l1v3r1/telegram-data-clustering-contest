      <p>The video shows a silver car drive past the group of people before reversing back along the road.</p>
      <p>The car then turns towards the group and a man finds himself on the bonnet.</p>
      <p>According to RTE, the car has since been seized for examination.</p>
      <p>One person who was there claimed an occupant in the vehicle shouted racist abuse.</p>
      <p>A garda spokesman said: "Gardai are investigating an incident of assault at School Road, Finglas, Dublin 11, on 18th November 2019 at approximately 9.40am.</p>
      <p>"A man in his 40s was taken to Mater Hospital with non-life threatening injuries."</p>
