      <h1>EA Scares Origin Users Into Thinking They're Hacked For No Reason</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T15:24:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 15:24</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Schreier</a></address>
      <p>This morning at around 3am, jolted awake by an antsy newborn, I rolled over to check my email and was alarmed to see a message from EA with the subject: “You’ve redeemed an Origin Access Membership Code.” <i>Goddamnit</i>, I thought. <i>Did someone hack me? </i>Turns out it was just EA starting off everyone’s day with a nice little scare.</p>

      <p>Ironically, this email came as the result of an EA initiative to reward users of its PC platform with more security. Last month, EA <a href="https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/account/login-verification-and-origin-access/">quietly announced</a> that Origin users with two-step verification enabled (in honor of “National Cybersecurity Month”) would get a free month of Origin Access Basic, which offers discounts and access to a bunch of old games. This was them making good on that promise.</p>
      <p>Now if only “making good” hadn’t also equated to “scaring the hell out of users into thinking they’d been hacked and might have even lost all of their progress in <i>Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</i> and had to start from scratch <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-bugs-are-forcing-players-t-1839948164">just like their buddy Kirk did</a>.” Telling people that they’ve redeemed a code out of the blue is a good way to get them to immediately freak out and change all their passwords, especially in a world where just about every company (EA included) has been the target of a massive security breach.</p>
      <p>I mean, fucking hell, EA, you scared the shit out of me last night. And a lot of other people:</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ea%20origin&amp;src=typed_query">on and on and on</a>. Why is it that even when they’re trying to do something nice, EA just can’t seem to avoid <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NUFHLngNEk">stepping on rakes</a>?</p>
