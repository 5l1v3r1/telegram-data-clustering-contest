      <p>An out-of-control Peapod delivery truck overturned and crashed into a Staten Island home Wednesday morning, seriously injuring the driver, officials and witnesses said.</p>
      <p>The wild incident unfolded at around 7:15 a.m. on Hillcrest Avenue in the Great Kills section of the borough as neighbor Trisha Talamanco was waiting for her grocery delivery from Peapod.</p>
      <p>“I was looking outside my window and I saw the driver pull up,” said Talamanco, 46, who lives two doors down from where the truck crashed. “I thought, ‘okay the food is here,’ and then all of a sudden the engine started to roar like [the driver] was stepping on the gas and he was gone.”</p>
      <p>“I heard the crash and he was in my neighbor’s house,” Talamanco said, adding that she ran out of her home screaming for her neighbors.</p>
      <p>“I’m thinking that’s their bedroom and they got crushed in their bed,” she said.</p>
      <p>In photos of the atftermath, the online grocery-delivery service’s box truck could be seen sticking out of the front of the home, rolled sideways and resting on an adjacent SUV parked in the driveway.</p>
      <p>Eventually, Talamanco’s neighbors came out of the home where the crash happened and appeared uninjured.</p>
      <p>“They were in a bit of a fog,” she said. “They were both sleeping so they were disoriented. To them it sounded like a bomb went off.”</p>
      <p>Talamanco said that the driver of the Peapod vehicle was also “disoriented.”</p>
      <p>“We asked, ‘are you okay?’” she recalled. “And he kept tapping his chest. We were told he may have suffered a stroke or heart attack.”</p>
      <p>Up to 10 FDNY units responded to the collision.</p>
      <p>Medics rushed the driver to Richmond University Medical Center in serious condition, officials said.</p>
      <p>The city’s Department of Environmental Protection was also called to the scene after there were reports of the vehicle leaking oil.</p>
      <p>Stop &amp; Shop supermarket, which works in partnership with Peapod, said in a statement that “there was an unfortunate accident this morning involving a Peapod truck after our driver suffered a medical emergency. The driver is currently being treated at an area hospital, and no one else was injured in the crash.”</p>
      <p>Talamanco pointed out that on the side of the Peapod truck it says: “Lettuce know how we’re driving.”</p>
      <p>“Well, not too great today,” Talamanco said in response, adding that after the incident, she called Peapod to say, “I don’t know if you’re aware, but your driver crashed into my neighbor’s home.”</p>
      <p>She said that a rep told her the company would reschedule her delivery order for Thursday, “and I was like, ‘can they walk it down, because all the neighbors will be freaking out when they see the truck again.”</p>
      <p>Talamanco noted that she felt “guilty” for the crash “because those were my groceries and I was getting the delivery.”</p>
      <p>“This morning my son was asking for milk and I said it’s on the truck.”</p>
      <p>Still, Talamanco, said, “This could have been a lot worse…It was a crazy morning.”</p>
