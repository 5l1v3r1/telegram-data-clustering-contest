      <h3>A New Xbox Feature Helps Players Quickly Purchase Games Their Friends Are Playing</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 20 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Major Nelson popped up on Twitter with the announcement of a new feature for Xbox, which will let players quickly buy what their friends are playing through a shortcut on the guide.</p>

      <p>The clip shows Director of Programming for Xbox Live, Larry Hryb, going on to his friends list. The list shows that one of his friends is playing Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Clicking on that friend's profile in his list brings up an option to install the game. Selecting that option brings up the link to either play it if it's already installed, install it if you already own it, or to buy it in the Microsoft store, along with a link to the official club. It's a quick way for to get caught up on what games your friends are enjoying, and to help catch up on ones you might have missed. Another advantage — or downside, depending on how you look at it — is, if one of your friends has vanished into their Xbox for longer than usual, you'll never be more than a few clicks away from also getting sucked into whichever game has them hooked.</p>
      <p>The example game which Hryb used was Fallen Order. It'd be pretty hard to forget if a friend had recommended a big title like this, but this new feature could make all the difference for indie games. If a friend recommends an amazing new indie game they've found, something which fits right into your particular preferred crossover of RTS and bean-farming, you can just look at their profile rather than make note of the title. It also solves the common problem of these last few months, where people are mixing up their Outer Wilds with their Outer Worlds – they're both good games in our opinon, but this way you can check which one your friend was actually playing. As some noted in the replies to Hyrb's tweet, this new feature is at least a great idea for Xbox themselves, facilitating quick impulse buys from people who want to join in with their friends. As yet, Hryb hasn't given a specific date for when this feature will be added, just that it can be seen "soon".</p>
      <p>Is this a feature you'll be using, or will it make no difference to you at all? What else would you like Xbox to add?

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
