      <p><b>MONROE, La. (KNOE) - </b>The current mayor of Monroe has released a statement regarding the announcement of a high-profile candidate seeking to take his place. Monroe businessman Friday Ellis announced this week that he plans to run against incumbent Mayor Jamie Mayo.</p>

      <p>
        <i>“Today’s announcement comes as no surprise. He will be the fourth former city employee to seek the office of Mayor during my administration. Any person has the right to seek public office and I respect their decision to do so. My formal re-election announcement is upcoming. My strong educational and business background has enabled my administration to lead our city through natural disasters and some tough financial &amp; economic times. We are in the best financial shape in our city’s history. By working with those from all sectors within our city, parish, region and state, my administration has fostered an environment for continued housing, educational, healthcare and economic growth. In addition, my strong relationship with Governor John Bel Edwards and our legislative delegation has benefitted Monroe with multiple infrastructure projects and advancements. My administration looks forward to having the opportunity to do even more for the people of our city.” - Mayor Jamie Mayo</i>
