      <p>Portions of Gauteng have been hit by heavy rains and flooding on Wednesday according to video reports on social media and warnings by the South African Weather Service (SAWS).</p>
      <p>A clip doing the rounds on Twitter, posted by Yusuf Abramjee and retweeted by SAWS, shows torrents of flood water rushing across a road near Midstream, Centurion.</p>

      <p>On Wednesday, SAWS  issued a number of severe thunderstorm warnings and watches across the province, one in particular alerted residents of Tshwane to potential “heavy downpours and localised flooding”.</p>
      <p>The warning remains in effect until 6pm Wednesday.</p>
