      <p>An icy moon of Jupiter is looking more and more like it could hold alien life deep in its subsurface sea. </p>
      <p>On Monday, NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa">announced</a> that scientists had officially measured water vapor on the moon, called Europa, for the first time.</p>
      <p>The discovery is yet another sign that Europa has all the right ingredients for aliens — given the right chemicals and a little deep-sea volcanic activity, it's possible that life could spring up (or already has) deep in the saltwater ocean below Europa's surface.</p>
      <p>Here's why scientists are increasingly looking to Europa in their hunt for alien life.</p>
      <h3>On Monday, NASA announced that scientists had measured water vapor on Europa for the first time.</h3>

      <p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope first spotted such water vapor on Europa in 2013, possibly erupting from geysers. But nobody had directly measured it until now.</p>
      <h3>The discovery is yet another clue that Europa could host alien life.</h3>

      <p>"Essential chemical elements (carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) and sources of energy, two of three requirements for life, are found all over the solar system. But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth," Lucas Paganini, a NASA planetary scientist who led the research, said in a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasa-scientists-confirm-water-vapor-on-europa">press release</a>. "While scientists have not yet detected liquid water directly, we've found the next best thing: water in vapor form."</p>
      <h3>Scientists have long suspected that Europa conceals an ocean below its icy surface — possibly with twice the volume of Earth's oceans.</h3>

      <h3>Liquid water is promising, but it's not enough. For life to arise, Europa needs two other ingredients: a few essential chemical elements, and a source of energy.</h3>

      <p>Asteroid impacts may have delivered even more life-giving elements.</p>
      <h3>In June, scientists spotted sodium chloride (also known as table salt) in Europa's icy surface, indicating that the ocean below is more like Earth's oceans than they previously thought.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Chemical reactions between <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/table-salt-compound-spotted-on-europa">this salt</a> and rocks on the ocean floor could create nitrogen compounds, which are crucial in the formation of life.</p>
      <h3>But there's one major problem: The sunlight that fuels life on Earth is 25 times fainter on Europa.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/A6ktEHGaZCB84rpuyETZqg--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/096f5812d327a6d9e09248c31ff46bfc"/>

      <p>Even the most durable species on Earth, which have adapted to the most extreme conditions, would probably not survive on Europa.</p>
      <h3>But Europa's oceans may be much warmer than its surface, thanks to its oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Kr_HF.3StL5CQyYQrnmAdA--~A/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/35955a8428cb4e5839ffb26eb08b6f8b"/>
      </figure>
      <p>NASA/JPL</p>
      <p>Because it's tidally locked, like our own moon, the same side of Europa is always facing Jupiter. </p>
      <p>As Europa follows its oval-shaped orbit, its distance from Jupiter changes, so the difference between the gravitational pull on Europa's two sides regularly grows and shrinks. These changes are called tides.</p>
      <h3>These tides stretch and relax Europa, cracking its surface ice and building friction that heats the moon from the inside.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>That's what keeps Europa's subsurface ocean from freezing solid.</p>
      <h3>These tides could crack Europa's mantle and give rise to deep-sea hydrothermal vents. On Earth, such vents produce intense heat that rips apart molecules and sparks chemical reactions.</h3>

      <p>Earth's hydrothermal vents form where seawater seeps into the planet's rocky crust, meets volcanically active rock, and blasts back toward the surface.</p>
      <h3>Life on Earth crops up around these vents. These ecosystems don't need sunlight to survive.</h3>

      <p>On land, food chains rely on plants to convert sunlight to sugar. But in the deep-sea food chain, microbes convert hydrogen to sugar. Rather than photosynthesis (which is fueled by light), this process of "chemosynthesis" uses chemical reactions.</p>
      <h3>Nobody knows yet if Europa has deep-sea vents, much less alien life. NASA plans to investigate these questions with its Europa Clipper mission.</h3>

      <p>Its radar tools will also measure the thickness of the ice and scan for subsurface water as the spacecraft gets as close as 16 miles to Europa's surface.</p>
      <h3>That investigation could help scientists prepare to land a future spacecraft on Europa's surface and punch through the ice.</h3>
