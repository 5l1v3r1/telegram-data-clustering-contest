                      <p>While Pakistan have not confirmed their Playing XI, 16-year old Naseem Shah debuting tomorrow looks a close possibility. Other than being their first Test post the sacking of former captain Sarfaraz Ahmed, this will also be Pakistan’s first Test in the ongoing ICC World Test Championship.</p>
                      <p>Having last won a Test match in Australia in 1995 under legendary fast bowler Wasim Akram’s leadership, the visiting team would be eager to register their first victory on the Australian soil in this century.</p>
