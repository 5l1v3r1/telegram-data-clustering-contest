      <p>Best Buy's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> doorbuster deals aren't slowing down, with fantastic deals every day on top quality home tech.</p>
      <p>Today's doorbuster knocks a huge $250 off this Arlo Pro 2 home security system, bringing the price down to just $399.99. Owned by Netgear, Arlo is a dependable name known for its affordable security cameras, and with this deal they're even better value than usual.</p>
      <p>The bundle include four weatherproof cameras that you can mount inside or outdoors. They can be used wire-free, powered by rechargeable batteries, or plugged in using the included power adaptor so you can simply set them up and leave them monitoring your property.</p>
      <p>Each camera records 1080p footage, and works well in poor lighting to capture sharp images at night. Two-way audio allows you to speak to people (ideal if you've mounted a camera outside your front door)</p>
      <p>Two sweeten the deal even more, unlike many home home security camera systems (such as Ring and Nest), Arlo doesn't charge a subscription fee for storing recordings included in the cloud, with rolling seven-day storage included as standard.</p>
      <p>Make sure you check out our pick of all of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2018">Best Buy's Black Friday deals</a> that are already live.</p>
