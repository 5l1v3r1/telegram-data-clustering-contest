      <p>English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur has unveiled Jose Mourinho as its new head coach, hours after naming the former Manchester United and Chelsea manager as the man to take over from Mauricio Pochettino.</p>

      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” said Mourinho. “The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
