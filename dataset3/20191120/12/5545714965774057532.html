      <p><i>Darksiders: Genesis</i> is getting ready to be unleashed next month on PC and Stadia (with a far-out February 2020 release on consoles), but until then, we can speculate and theorycraft on how in-depth this hack and slash is going to be.</p>
      <p>The latest video deals with abilities and a mechanic called "creature cores," which are doled out after killing enemies and grant game-changing abilities. Many of them seem to be area-of-effect-based, but we also get a glimpse at the skill tree and some of the more nuanced powers. I'm not expecting <i>Path of Exile</i> depth here, but what we're seeing so far is promising enough for an action-centric top-down joint. I also dig the idea that you can run through the game once as the melee-powered War, then again as the ranged Strife.</p>
      <p>In fact I'm just jazzed about playing as Strife in general, who is the only horseman to date that hasn't had his own game. I do hope we get that dedicated entry at some point!</p>
