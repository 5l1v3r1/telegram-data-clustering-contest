      <p><b>Lyft</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/lyft-stock-quote/"><b><u>LYFT</u></b></a>) stock is more valuable now that it has posted two full quarters of cash flow profitability. Cash flow from operations (CFFO) as of the third quarter was positive $10 million. This follows up Q2 CFFO of $15.2 million. These cash flow profitable quarters make Lyft stock more attractive to investers.</p>

      <p>The cash flow profitability may not be readily apparent to investors. I talked about this last quarter <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/09/lyft-stock-more-profitable-uber/">in my article</a> “Lyft Stock is More Profitable Than It Appears.” You have to look carefully at the company’s cash flow statement to determine this.</p>
      <p>For example, in Q3, Lyft reported nine months of cash flow from operations of -$59.5 million. But in Q2, the same figure was -$69.5 million. That means that CFFO improved by $10 million during Q3.  The same was true as of Q2 compared to Q1.</p>

      <p>This can be seen in the table at right using data taken from the company’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1759509/000156459019039781/lyft-10q_20190930.htm#CONDENSED_CONSOLIDATED_STATEMENTS_CASH_F">SEC filings</a>. The first table shows the cumulative CFFO figures. Then the second table shows the quarterly changes.</p>
      <p>Note also that Lyft is slowly marching towards free cash flow profitability, although for the time being it is still negative.</p>
      <p>This is important because it will show that once Lyft is FCF positive, it won’t burn cash on a quarterly basis after all capital expenditures are made.</p>
      <h3>Lyft Stock Is Still Much Cheaper Than Uber</h3>
      <p>Comparing the CFFO figures between it and <b>Uber Technologies</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/uber-stock-quote/"><b><u>UBER</u></b></a>) shows that Lyft is healthier.</p>
      <p>For example, last quarter Uber lost $908 million in CFFO during its Q3. This represents over 30% of its $3.1 billion in quarterly sales. That means that for every dollar of sales, Uber lost over 30% in cash flow.</p>
      <p>But Lyft’s $10 million CFFO represents 1% of its $955 million in Q3 sales. That means for every dollar of sales it returned 1% in positive cash flow from operations for shareholders.</p>
      <p>As a result, Lyft stock is much cheaper and more attractive than Uber stock. For example, Lyft trades at an attractive EV-to-revenue ratio of just 2.7 times its 2020 estimated sales. But Uber trades at over 3.2 times EV-to-revenue. More importantly, I believe that Lyft’s CFFO profitability could quadruple by 2020, reaching over 4% of sales, or $140 million to $150 million. At that rate, Lyft stock trades at an attractive CFFO yield of 1.5%.</p>
      <p>But UBER’s valuation will remain negative, since it is expected to still lose money on a CFFO basis.</p>
      <h3>The Market Is Starting To Recognize Lyft Stock’s Value</h3>
      <p>Although Uber stock is trading at its market lows, Lyft stock has started to make forward progress. Lyft stock is one-third the size of Uber in terms of market capitalization at $13 billion. But as its CFFO profitability increases, Lyft stock should continue to gain market value over its competitor.</p>
      <p>Investors should watch Lyft’s quarterly cash flow profitability carefully. Once it is clear that the company is no longer burning cash, Lyft stock will likely rise much faster than Uber.</p>
      <p>Uber seems to be stuck in non-profitable operations. the market will begin to make a difference between the two stocks as Lyft gains in profitability.</p>
