      <h1>Boarding school suspends two pupils after Remembrance display photograph doctored to include swastika</h1>

      <p>A distinguished boarding school has suspended two pupils after it emerged that its Remembrance display photograph was doctored to feature a swastika.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, four fifteen foot banners depicting the silhouette of a British soldier were displayed on the main building of Framlingham College, in Suffolk, to commemorate the soldiers who fought in the great wars.</p>
      <p>But after a special service in the College chapel last Sunday, staff discovered that a student had superimposed a drawing of a swastika onto a photo of the banners, which was then posted onto a private social media account.</p>
      <p>Framlingham College, which boarding fees total over £30,000,  wrote to the families of all 400 pupils apologising for the incident, and confirmed that the pair had been immediately suspended.</p>
      <p>Louise North, the school's principal, said: “I apologise unreservedly for the offence caused by the behaviour of these pupils which contradicts in the strongest terms the ethos of this school.</p>
      <p>“The Framlingham College community has the most profound respect for the nation's servicemen and women, our veterans and the fallen.</p>
      <p>“Every year the college reflects on the huge sacrifice made by those who have served and those who have fallen through Chapel addresses, classroom discussions, external speakers and charitable undertaking.</p>
      <p>“This year was no different which makes the aberrant behaviour of these pupils all the more deplorable. In both cases, the actions were completely out of character and both are full of remorse.”</p>
      <p>Busted singer Charlie Simpson and television presenter David Bull are among the former pupils of the co-educational college, which educates pupils from 3 to 18 years of age.</p>
