      <h1>The Milk Thistle and Her Majesty's Secret Service named among best cocktail bars in UK</h1>
      <h2>But we already knew that...</h2>

      <p>There's no shortage of cracking cocktail bars in Bristol, from swanky establishments to dark and dingy speakeasies tucked away off the beaten track.</p>
      <p>Some of the finest Bristol bars regularly scoop awards and two of the very best have just picked up a further accolade.</p>
      <p>The Milk Thistle and Her Majesty's Secret Service have been included in a round-up of the UK's top 40 cocktail bars by hen party organiser Go Hen.</p>
      <p>In the list of 40 bars, there are six in the South West, with No. 131 The Promenade in Cheltenham and The Hideout in Bath also making the cut.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year Milk Thistle was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/bristol-milk-thistle-cocktail-bar-2925167">named as the sixth best cocktail bar in the UK</a> in the The Top 50 Cocktail Bars awards, making it a memorable year for the team.</p>

      <p>What Go Hen says about Milk Thistle: "From this day forward, we’re going to start every conversation we ever have with: ‘Have you heard of the Milk Thistle?’</p>
      <p>"It’s too good not to talk about all the time (even if it is a hidden gem). The cocktails, the atmosphere, the cocktails, the décor, the cocktails, the people, the cocktails, the cocktails, THE COCKTAILS! It was love at first sip!"</p>

      <p>What Go Hen says about HMSS:"We were in double-o heaven when we discovered this fab cocktail venue.</p>
      <p>"Shaken, stirred, we’re not a fussy bunch, as long as it tantalises our taste buds and knocks our socks off, we don’t care.</p>
      <p>"And we were walking home barefoot because our socks were blown straight into the Avon. The perfect place to start, finish and spend the whole evening."</p>
