      <h1>Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s set for ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ leaves Alia Bhatt awestruck</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:41:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjay-Leela-Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a> is one filmmaker in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> who is known for his grandeur and larger than life sets. His Midas touch makes every film of his an experience in its own right. Be it ‘Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam’ or ‘Padmaavat’, every actor wants to be part his kind storytelling. Therefore, when actor <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Alia-Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a> saw the sets of her upcoming film ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’, her reaction was worth billions. The actress was passing by when she realised that she was closer to the ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ sets.</p>
      <p>Alia Bhatt will make her maiden entry in the Sanjay Leela Bhansali world with his next directorial ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’.And she was left stunned by the same.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the same, an inside source said, “Alia Bhatt was passing by and was completely awestruck by the magnanimity of the sets. The movie set for ‘Gangubai Kathiawadi’ is not just larger than life but also a lot more grand and beautiful than Sanjay sir’s earlier films like ‘Padmaavat’ and ‘Goliyon Ki Raasleela: Ram Leela’. There is a lot of fine detailing that has gone into making of the set and it is bigger than what anyone would have ever since.”</p>
      <p>The film will also reportedly star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ajay-Devgn">Ajay Devgn</a> in the lead role opposite Alia Bhatt.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Alia is also part of some interesting projects like, ‘Sadak 2’, ‘Takht’, ‘Brahmastra’ and ‘RRR’. Ajay, on the other hand, is gearing up for his next ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’.</p>
