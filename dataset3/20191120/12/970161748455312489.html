        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/daniel-osbourne/">Daniel Osbourne</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rob-mallard/">Rob Mallard</a>) is set to face arrest in Coronation Street tonight as he goes on a rampage in a pawn shop, convinced that they have his stolen laptop containing videos left for him and Bertie by Sinead.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A spate of burglaries in the area, actually committed by Kel (Joseph Alessi), has seen Daniel’s laptop go missing – an added blow in the wake of Sinead’s funeral. As Craig Tinker (Colson Smith) can see how much it is breaking Daniel to have lost the precious final memories of his late wife, he offers to go with him round pawn shops to try and see if they can locate the stolen computer.</p>
      <p>When they arrive at one, Daniel is convinced that he has seen the laptop in the cabinet and demands it back, accusing the shocked shop owner of handling stolen goods. Craig tries to diffuse the situation but as things get out of hand, Daniel grabs a nearby golf club and smashes the glass of the cabinet to try and get the computer.</p>

      <p>It turns out that he is wrong about the laptop and the police are called. They prepare to put vulnerable Daniel under arrest but Craig tries to intervene with his colleagues and explain Daniel’s circumstances. Can he stop him being locked up?</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Bernie Winter (Jane Hazlegrove) will get suspicious about Kel’s behaviour and, after some digging, will realise that he has been stealing from the neighbours. But as she looks into it further, a discovery is made which looks set to expose the true nature of the child abuser.</p>

      <p>When he is reported to police by Bernie, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/coronation-street-spoilers-paedophile-kel-hinchley-takes-bernie-winter-hostage-as-his-sex-crimes-are-exposed-11005688/">he lashes out at her and ends up holding her hostage</a> as Paul (Peter Ash) and Gemma (Dolly-Rose Campbell) rush to the rescue.</p>
      <p>But as Kel is apprehended, will Daniel’s lost memories of Sinead be recovered?</p>
