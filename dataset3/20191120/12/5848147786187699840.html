      <h1>Donald Trump addresses health scare after Melania concerned he had heart attack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:41:26+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/ckelly/" target="_blank">Cait Kelly</a></address>
      <p>A prominent US cardiologist has questioned White House denials that President Donald Trump was treated for a heart attack on the weekend.</p>
      <p>Mr Trump on Wednesday (Australian time) denied he suffered a heart attack or chest pains amid speculation over his sudden trip to hospital.</p>
      <p>Dr Jonathan Reiner, former vice president Dick Cheney’s personal cardiologist, told CNN later Wednesday he was “skeptical” about White House claims the Saturday hospital visit was “routine”.</p>
      <p>Speaking before a cabinet meeting at the White House, Mr Trump brought up the unscheduled trip without prompting.</p>
      <p>He said that he had gone to hospital to do a portion of his yearly physical – and berated the media for worrying his wife, Melania.</p>
      <p>“I went for a physical, and I came back,” Mr Trump said.</p>
      <p>“My wife said ‘darling, are you Ok? What’s wrong? Oh, they’re reporting that you may have had a heart attack.’</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘Why did I have a heart attack?’</p>
      <p>“‘Because you went to Walter Reed Medical Centre’,” he said Mrs Trump replied.</p>
      <p>“That’s where we go when we get the physical. I said I was only there for a very short period of time,” the President added.</p>

      <p>“I was called by our people in public relations: ‘Sir, are you OK?’. I said ‘OK for what?’. ‘The word is you had a heart attack. CNN said you may have had a heart attack. You had massive chest pains. You went to the hospital’.”</p>
      <p>Dr Reiner maintained that the explanation for the visit didn’t add up.</p>
      <p>“A spontaneous trip for a medical exam is distinctly uncommon, raising the question of whether there was something specifically at issue that required an evaluation on Saturday,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Almost everything that is usually done in a presidential physical like this, can be done in the White House at the White House medical unit. So, it doesn’t really make a lot of sense why the President would travel up to Walter Reed on a Saturday afternoon for this kind of testing.”</p>
      <p>Unlike Mr Trump’s last two visits to Walter Reed for physicals, Sunday’s trip was not published on his public schedule ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Adding to the intrigue was the fact that journalists in the President’s press pool were told not to report on his movements until he arrived at the centre – a protocol generally used when the motorcade route has not been adequately secured.</p>

      <p>The theory the President fell unwell intensified in the days after as he stayed out of the public eye.</p>
      <p>“Visited a great family of a young man under major surgery at the amazing Walter Reed Medical Centre,” the President tweeted early Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Those are truly some of the best doctors anywhere in the world. Also began phase one of my yearly physical. Everything very good (great!). Will complete next year.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, Mr Trump’s doctor said the President had not experienced any “chest pain” or “urgent or acute issues”.</p>
