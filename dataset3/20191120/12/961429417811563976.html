        <b>An acute trust has taken the “drastic” step of halting some planned surgery activity for a period of four months, as it bids to free up capacity for emergency care.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Northampton General Hospital Trust said it has cancelled “some” non-urgent inpatient surgery procedures effective immediately until the end of March.</p>
      <p>The trust said it was currently unable to state the number of patients affected, as it was still working with alternative providers to see if patients can be treated elsewhere.</p>
      <p>However, it said the move will affect all specialties. Over a four-month period, the trust typically reports around 15,600 completed elective admissions.</p>
      <p>A trust spokesman said: “As we move into our busiest period we are working to manage the demand that we will have for our services this winter.</p>
      <p>“We are working to prepare for these pressures in a more structured way to help us to avoid cancelling surgery at short notice. We know previously that this has caused a lot of frustration for patients, some of whom have been cancelled multiple times, which we believe is an unacceptable way to treat our patients.</p>
      <p>“We have therefore reluctantly taken the decision, with input from our divisional management team and clinical leaders, to cease some routine non-urgent surgery that requires an inpatient bed at Northampton General Hospital.”</p>
      <p>He stressed the trust will continue to provide emergency surgery and cancer surgery, along with “as many day case procedures as we are able to”.</p>
      <p>Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, told <i>HSJ</i>: “It is very worrying to hear that an NHS hospital has taken the drastic step of cancelling, for the next four months, planned surgery requiring an overnight stay.</p>
      <p>“Northampton is not the only hospital struggling. Surgeons across the country have raised concerns that waiting times for planned operations continue to grow.</p>
      <p>“In September 2019, there were 4.42 million patients on the NHS waiting list — the highest ever. The answer to this is not to cancel surgery.</p>
      <p>“We have called on all the party leaders to protect patients’ right to a maximum wait of 18 weeks for planned care in the next Parliament.”</p>
      <p>The trust’s most recent performance against the four-hour emergency target was 78 per cent.</p>
      <p>The move comes amid moves from regulators to encourage trusts to open more beds over winter, or to outsource elective operations to free up capacity.</p>
