      <h1>Bristol Rovers verdict: Menayese impresses against Bromley and plastic pitch frustrates</h1>
      <h2>What we learned from the FA Cup victory</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:55:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Rovers are through to the second round of the FA Cup after a hard-fought 1-0 win over Bromley.</p>
      <p>Gas boss Graham Coughlan admitted it wasn't an exciting performance, but is now preparing to<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-plymouth-fa-cup-3557139"> face Plymouth Argyle in the next round.</a></p>
      <p>Jonson Clarke-Harris scored the only goal of the game, but there were other players in the Rovers squad who impressed at Hayes Lane.</p>
      <p>Here are five things we learned from the Bromley win.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Menayese comes of age</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rollin Menayese has so far been limited to a few promising performances in the EFL Trophy this season, but he looked the part against Bromley. The 21-year-old started on the right side of a back three and played so well that he eventually shifted across to right-back when the Gas switched to 4-4-2, with the more experienced Mark Little instead being the player withdrawn.</p>
      <p>BT named Menayese as their man of the match and it was difficult to argue with their choice. The defender was dominant in the air and also looked the part with the ball at his feet, making two or three good breaks forward from the back.</p>
      <p>With Tom Davies' return from injury dragging on, Menayese's display should assuage any fears over any perceived lack of depth in defence.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Players risked</b>
      </p>
      <p>Graham Coughlan had us fooled on Monday when he suggested that Jonson Clarke-Harris and Ollie Clarke may not feature due to the impact a plastic pitch may have on their recoveries from muscular injuries. Both players elected to play and combined for the winning goal, with Clarke winning the ball high up the pitch and putting in a killer pass for Clarke-Harris to stab home.</p>

      <p>Both played the whole game and did not seem to suffer any ill-effects from playing on a pitch that had very little give. Post-match, Ollie Clarke suggested that it was more likely to impact Rovers' recovery from the game, and that their session on Thursday ahead of facing Shrewsbury Town may be a little less intensive to allow players more time to recover.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, with Graham Coughlan leaving the final call up to the players as to whether they would feature, it was good to see them putting their bodies on the line to help Rovers through to the next round.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jordi impresses</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is fair to say Anssi Jaakkola has been one of Rovers' standout players this season. Barring the odd mistake - including in the original game between the Gas and Bromley - <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mini-fist-pump-player-ratings-3555674">the Finnish goalkeeper has been in great form</a>, often single-handedly securing points on his own.</p>
      <p>It has meant the performances of back-up Jordi van Stappershoef have often been overshadowed. The Dutchman has not played too often, making just six appearances so far this season, but he has generally looked solid when called upon. That trend continued on Tuesday evening, with the 23-year-old keeping his third successive clean sheet for the Gas.</p>

      <p>Van Stappershoef did not have too many saves to make, and most of the shots that came his way were directly at him, but his big stature came in handy when claiming numerous balls that were sent into the penalty area by the hosts. Alongside that, for a relatively young goalkeeper, he showed a good awareness to slow the game down when the Gas were put under pressure, taking his time over set pieces and when the ball was in his hand to allow the side a chance to regroup.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Plastic not so fantastic</b>
      </p>
      <p>For many Rovers fans and players, Tuesday was likely the first opportunity to see a competitive game on a plastic pitch. In fairness, Bromley's 3G pitch is one of the better ones in non-league football, but it still produced a drab game of football, with both sides employing a direct style of play.</p>
      <p>Walking on the pitch post-match, it was certainly noticeable how different it felt to normal grass, with an unnatural amount of give beneath the feet. It would have no doubt taken some getting used to for Rovers' players, so credit must go to the club for preparing in the right way by training on different artificial pitches across Bristol pre-match.</p>
      <p>For non-league clubs, the benefit of a 3G pitch is obvious - it allows them to garner extra income by renting their ground out to third parties without damaging the surface, and it also limits the risk of having games called off. However, there is still such a wide variety in the quality of artificial surfaces that it is difficult to make a case for them being used in the EFL.</p>
      <p>If you'll excuse the pun, plastic pitches do not allow for a level playing field.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Coughlan planning for January</b>
      </p>
      <p>Post-match, Graham Coughlan made no secret of the fact he hoped the money earned from the two games against Bromley, the next round against Plymouth and the fact the Gas have advanced in the EFL Trophy <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/graham-coughlan-eager-see-bristol-3556987">would go towards his playing budget.</a></p>

      <p>It was not the first time the manager has mentioned the January transfer window and, after a promising first half to the season, we will soon get an indication of the Rovers hierarchy's aims for the campaign. Coughlan and the Rovers recruitment team have clearly drawn up a plan of action for January, so, if they are backed, it would suggest hopes are high that Rovers can really mount a play-off challenge this season.</p>
