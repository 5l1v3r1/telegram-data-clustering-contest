      <p>ITV's This Morning left viewers in tears today when a married couple told their defiant love story.</p>
      <p>Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield were joined by 72-year-old Barbara Hamlin and her transgender husband. <br/><br/>In 2014, Barbara's husband John, now 71, had gender reassignment surgery and transitioned to become Jane.</p>
      <p>Eight years into their marriage, Barbara started to have suspicions that her husband was having an affair. <br/><br/>While packing to go on holiday, Barbara discovered a bag of women's clothes containing skirts, hotpants and underwear - alongside a pair of black patent stilettos. <br/><br/>It was then she started to fear the worst.</p>

      <p>During a holiday to Canada, Barbara confronted John about the bag of clothes only to discover that they were for him. <br/><br/>Barbara was overcome "with a feeling of relief" she explained to Holly.</p>
      <p>"I did know about cross-dressing and transgender very vaguely and this wasn't as scary as losing ones relationship in a marriage," Barbara said. <br/><br/>Jane went on to explain that this was the beginning of a huge weight being lifted off her shoulders. <br/><br/>"When it was gone I was on cloud nine," Jane explained. <br/><br/>They both went on to say they are the happiest they have ever been and praised their support network of friends and neighbours.</p>
      <p>Viewers were overcome with emotion and took to social media to wish them well. <br/><br/>One Twitter user wrote: "Best of luck to them - if your happy thatâ€™s all that matters! #ThisMorning" <br/><br/>Another said: "Jane had a permanent smile on her face throughout that interview. How inspiring for other trans people who are about to embark on that life-changing journey #This Morning" <br/><br/>"Their love defied gender &amp; they look truly happy. That is exactly what I needed to see today," another commented.</p>
