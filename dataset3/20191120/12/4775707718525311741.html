      <h3>The 725 Shotgun in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Gets Yet Another Nerf</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 20 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Infinity Ward has rolled out a new update for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Call-of-Duty-Modern-Warfare/achievements">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</a> and once again the most controversial weapon in the game has received a nerf. The 725 shotgun is once again the focal point of the update, receiving changes to its weapon damage range and reduced hip fire damage.</p>

      <p>Players have been running rampant with 725 in multiplayer, attaching scopes, and getting kills from long distances. The second nerf, which was just over a week ago, actually buffed the weapon in a roundabout way and made it more effective from a distance. In the patch notes, it details that the weapon has received a "small" reduction to its base weapon damage range, the damage range added by attachments has been "significantly" reduced and hip fire damage has been reduced. The model 680 shotgun has also had a reduction to damage range with range extending attachments.</p>
      <p>The update also fixes several bugs to do with Ground War and some general fixes. We have included Infinity Ward's list of patch notes below:</p>
