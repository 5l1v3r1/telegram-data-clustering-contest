      <h1>Springboks reveal who they will face in their first matches since RWC triumph</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:21:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>World Cup winners <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> have confirmed who they will face in 2020 in their first matches as champions.</p>
      <p>Having lifted the trophy in Yokohama at the start of November and embarked on a champions tour of their country, Springboks rugby has been basking in the limelight and they have now revealed who Rassie Erasmus’ yet-to-be-announced successor will take on next July.</p>
      <p>The Springboks will face <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/georgia">Georgia</a> in three home Tests in the new international window, as part of the Castle Lager Incoming Series match schedule.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/former-ireland-lock-suggests-asterix-beside-springboks-rwc-win-steroids">The newly-crowned World Cup champions</a> are scheduled to play two Tests against Scotland – July 4 and 11 – before hosting Georgia on July 18.</p>
      <p>It will be the Scots’ first visit to South Africa since June 2014, when the Boks beat them 55-6 in Port Elizabeth.</p>

      <p>The Springboks and Georgia have only met once before, in a pool match at the World Cup in 2003 in Sydney when South Africa won 46-19.</p>
      <p>SA Rugby will confirm the venues and kick-off times of the three matches at a later stage.</p>
