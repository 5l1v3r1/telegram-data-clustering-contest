      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/stevenage">Stevenage</a> caretaker manager Mark Sampson has been charged by the Football Association with making an offensive remark.</p>
      <p>The former England Women head coach is alleged to have made the remark to a coach who used to work with the League Two club earlier this season. It was alleged that the remark was aimed at a player during a conversation about transfer targets.</p>
      <p>A statement from the FA released on Wednesday read: “Mark Sampson has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3. It is alleged that a comment made by the Stevenage FC caretaker manager breached FA Rule E3(1) as it was improper and/or abusive and/or insulting.</p>
      <p>“It is further alleged that the comment also constitutes an ‘aggravated breach’, which is defined in FA Rule E3(2), as it referenced ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality.”</p>
      <p>Stevenage said in September that an internal investigation into the matter had found that there was no case for Sampson to answer. The club said at the time that the allegation was reported to the FA by phone “by a former coach the day after he was told by Sampson that he no longer required his services at the club”.</p>
      <p>Stevenage chief executive Phil Wallace said in September: “Like every professional club, no matter where the complaint comes from, we follow strict procedures, which were followed to the letter.</p>
      <p>“The claimant was offered the chance to make a formal complaint but declined this opportunity, instead choosing to call the FA. Nevertheless, CEO Alex Tunbridge acted immediately to interview and take statements from two individuals the claimant said were witnesses, as well as others that were present in the same meeting, but not mentioned by the claimant.”</p>
      <p>Sampson, who was sacked as England Women head coach in September 2017 for “inappropriate and unacceptable” behaviour with female players in a previous role, has until 6 December 2019 to provide a response to the charge.</p>
