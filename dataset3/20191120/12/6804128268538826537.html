      <h1>Arsenal 2019/20 season if Mauricio Pochettino replaces Unai Emery predicted by Football Manager</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino is now available after being sacked by Tottenham, so what would happen if he replaced Unai Emery at Arsenal?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bliss</a></address>
      <p>Well, that escalated quickly.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by Tottenham, despite reaching the Champions League final last season, and has been swiftly replaced by former Manchester United and Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Although Arsenal fans will be smirking at the chaos unfolding at Spurs, it could lead to a great opportunity over the next few weeks, with Pochettino now available if the Gunners want to get rid of Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Although it's not looking likely right now, weirder things have happened in football.</p>
      <p>So, what would happen if Pochettino did replace Emery?</p>
      <p>And, where would Arsenal finish under the Argentine?</p>
      <p>We used Football Manager 2020 to have a bit of fun and see what could happen.</p>

      <p>At the present time, Emery is struggling to make Arsenal a top four team, with the Gunners sitting in sixth place, eight points behind fourth place Man City.</p>
      <p>So, how would Pochettino get on?</p>
      <p>The Argentine did more than make the top four for Arsenal, he made them genuine title challengers.</p>
      <p>Arsenal finished in second place in the league table, just four points behind champions Liverpool, and seven points ahead of Manchester City, finishing with an outstanding 87 points total.</p>

      <p>Tottenham, with Jose Mourinho in charge, finished in sixth place with just 60 points, some 27 points behind Pochettino's new side. Ouch!</p>

      <p>The Argentine largely played a 4-2-3-1, in what was a similar system to the one he deployed at Spurs, playing Mesut Ozil as a playmaker in the number ten role, with Aubameyang and Pepe in wide areas.</p>
      <p>Ceballos and Guendouzi were preferred to Xhaka or Torreira in midfield, with Tierney, David Luiz and Calum Chambers all first team regulars.</p>

      <p>Lacazette was in outstanding form under Pochettino, scoring 25 goals in the season, as Guendouzi led the assist charts with 11.</p>
      <p>Some of Arsenal's best results included a thrilling 3-2 win against Poch's former team Spurs.</p>

      <p>They also beat eventual champions Liverpool at the Emirates, with Pepe and Lacazette both scoring.</p>

      <p>But it wasn't all good for Arsenail under Poch, they didn't make a big impact in the domestic cup competitions, going out of the Carabao Cup in the fourth round (lost to Manchester United) and the FA Cup quarter-final (lost to Liverpool).</p>
      <p>The Gunners also reached the Europa League final, beating teams like Sevilla, Lazio and Eintracht Frankfurt along the way, but eventually lost the final to fellow English side Manchester United.</p>

      <p>At the end of the season, Pochettino had to deal with some big player issues, with three of his squad transfer listed for differing reasons.</p>
      <p>Mesut Ozil was immediately transfer listed for failing to agree a new deal at the end of the season, with Poch demanding Â£33million.</p>

      <p>Shkodran Mustafi was also transfer listed after Poch didn't deem him good enough to be registered in the Arsenal squad.</p>

      <p>Former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka also demanded a move, with the Switzerland international not being a regular under Pochettino.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>So Pochettino again failed to win a trophy in 2019/20, this time with Arsenal, but he did achieve an outstanding league finish, something that is looking doubtful under Unai Emery.</p>
      <p>Overall, Football Manager 2020 predicts that he would be a great appointment at Arsenal, if they decide to get rid of the Spaniard.</p>
