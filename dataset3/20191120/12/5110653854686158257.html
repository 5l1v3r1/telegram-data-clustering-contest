      <h3>Will T.Y. Hilton play Thursday night?</h3>
      <p>Hilton is making “great progress” toward his return from a calf injury, Colts head coach Frank Reich <a href="https://twitter.com/HolderStephen/status/1196484350252109825">said Monday morning</a>. Hilton was listed as a “Did Not Participate” in the Indianapolis estimated practice report later Monday ahead of the Colts’ Thursday night game in Houston.</p>
      <p>A number of other Colts were listed as DNP, although Devin Funchess(clavicle) didn’t need to be listed since he’s yet to be activated from IR. The expectation is that Funchess is close, but we’ll have to wait to learn more of his status. If Hilton is out again, Zach Pascal and Marcus Johnson will continue playing outside when the Colts go two wide against the vulnerable Texans’ pass defense.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Is Will Fuller playing Thursday night?</h3>
      <p>Fuller was listed as a limited participant on the Texans’ estimated practice report Monday, and Houston head coach Bill O’Brien called him a <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesPalmerTV/status/1196468256980324358">game-time decision</a> for Thursday night against the Colts. Fuller hasn’t played since injuring his hamstring in Week 7.</p>
      <p>It seems likely that even if Fuller returns, he could be on a pitch count ahead of a 10 day rest before Houston’s next game. A return would also push Kenny Stills and Keke Coutee further down the depth chart. Fuller will eventually resume his role as a boom-or-bust WR3 for the Texans.<br/><br/><b>WEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rb-rankings-running-back-sleepers/1x0x7s3rojv001j4w68nm8zos7">Running back</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-ppr-rankings-wr-fantasy-football-wide-receiver-sleepers/1o9fjg2z6mzra1nyyh9xc82iar">Wide receiver</a> | <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/week-12-fantasy-ppr-rankings-tight-end-sleepers-te/1w752s5mgwmem1ie8oz1iw01e9">Tight end</a></b></p>
      <h3>Tyler Lockett injury update</h3>
      <p>Pete Carroll <a href="https://twitter.com/BradyHenderson/status/1196600606258913286?s=20">told reporters Monday</a> that the Seahawks are “hoping” and “planning” that Lockett will be available after he sustained what turned into a scary leg injury before Seattle’s bye. Carroll said Lockett’s status will be more certain later in the week.</p>
      <p>As long as Lockett plays, he needs to start in fantasy leagues, especially against a bad Eagles secondary. DK Metcalf should remain a fantasy starter in that matchup regardless, too. It will be interesting to see how much Josh Gordon plays after having the bye week to get more acclimated to the Seattle offense. If Lockett is out, Gordon would make for a solid WR3.</p>

      <h3>Brandin Cooks concussion update</h3>
      <p>Sean McVay <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1196634208380301313">told reporters Monday</a> that he expects Cooks to make his return in Week 12. Cooks has missed multiple weeks due to a concussion. The Rams play on Monday night against the Ravens.</p>
      <p>At least it sounds like fantasy owners will know Cooks’ status without having to wait until Monday to find out. What’s more concerning is how bad L.A.’s offense has been of late. Cooks should be considered a boom-or-bust WR3.</p>
      <h3>Is Alshon Jeffery playing Week 12?</h3>
      <p>Just as Doug Pederson said about Jordan Howard, he said Jeffery is “progressing nicely” and “doing well” after Jeffery missed Week 11 with an ankle injury.The Eagles take on Seattle at 1 p.m. ET Sunday.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia’s passing game was pretty lame without Jeffery in Week 11, but that was against New England. Expect a continued Jeffery absence to mean Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert are the two most-utilized Philly pass catchers, though Nelson Agholor would have more value this week against a Seattle defense that gives up a lot of catches to wide receivers.</p>
      <h3>Sterling Shepard injury news</h3>
      <p>Shepard (concussion) <a href="https://twitter.com/PLeonardNYDN/status/1196546749558599687">was a full participant</a> in Monday’s practice. He hasn’t played since Week 5 due to his second concussion of the season. The Giants play in Chicago at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Shepard’s return would knock Bennie Fowler out of three-WR sets. It will be interesting to see how it affects Darius Slayton, who’s been a revelation with Shepard out. Daniel Jones’ full allotment of weapons is getting close to healthy, which should only help his value, too.</p>
      <h3>When will A.J. Green be back?</h3>
      <p>Green has remained out with the ankle injury he sustained in the preseason. He suffered a setback a couple weeks ago and still hasn’t played in 2019. The Bengals host the Steelers in Week 12 and will probably do so without Auden Tate, who hurt his neck in Week 11.</p>
      <p>Until there’s positive news on Green, there’s no reason to expect he’ll be back in Week 12. Alex Erickson will step up as the No. 2 WR if Tate and Green are both out. John Ross (clavicle) can return from IR in Week 13 for the Bengals.</p>
