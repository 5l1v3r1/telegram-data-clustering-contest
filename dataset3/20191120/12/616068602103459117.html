      <p>Silver Star Mountain Resort will be bursting with Pride next month.</p>
      <p>The North Okanagan ski hill is partnering with Rebellious Unicorns to host Peak Pride 2019 Dec. 6-8.</p>
      <p>Peak Pride brings together the LGBT2Q+ community, while working with local mountains on creating inclusive and welcoming communities for people of all gender identities, gender expression, sexual orientation, race and religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>"We are so excited about this partnership with Rebellious Unicorns," said Chantelle Deacon, media relations manager, SilverStar. "We are honoured to host Peak Pride at SilverStar, and we are excited to make it an annual, on-mountain event.<br/>"As a community-orientated mountain, we believe in inclusivity, while continuing to add more events that everyone will enjoy.</p>
      <p>Peak Pride started at Big White in 2017 and has since expanded to Sun Peaks, and now SilverStar. All Peak Pride events are open to everyone no matter how they identify or express themselves.</p>
      <p>“I am thrilled to be working with the SilverStar team on bringing Peak Pride to the resort," said Dustyn Baulkham, executive producer, Rebellious Unicorns Production Company Inc. "Peak Pride at SilverStar will be the last Pride event in North America of the 2019 season and also the first winter Pride event of the 2019-20 ski season.<br/>"SilverStar is investing in their staff by having a significant proportion of them participate in the Canadian LGBT+ Chamber of Commerces LGBT Diversity Tourism Training Workshop prior to Peak Pride taking place. It's going to be a great way to kick off the 2019/2020 season.”<br/>The weekend will feature a drag show by Freida Whales &amp; Ella Lamoureux at the wipeOUT party on Saturday, while Kelowna musician DJ Shado spins the beats.</p>
      <p>There will also be a mountain pride parade down Milky Way and more.<br/> <br/>For all the details about Peak Pride SilverStar, please visit peakpride.ca/silverstar2019/ or skisilverstar.com/events/peak-pride-at-silverstar/<br/> </p>
