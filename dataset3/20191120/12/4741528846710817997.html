      <h1>New PwC outlook examines how changing media trends affect advertising</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:58:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/emmanuel-abara/" target="_blank">Emmanuel Abara Benson</a></address>
      <p>The PwC <b>Africa Entertainment &amp; Media Outlook</b> report for the years covering 2019 to 2023 has revealed some rather interesting findings. Of course, the report acknowledged the fact that the media landscape in Nigeria and elsewhere is changing and will continue to do so in the coming years.</p>
      <p><b>It should be noted </b>that at the centre of this transformation is content personalisation, a trend that is also influencing how companies advertise their products.</p>
      <p><b>Focus on the trends: </b>The report found that media consumers in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania have become increasingly specific when it comes to how they want their contents delivered. Thanks to the internet and proliferation of mobile devices, these consumers prefer “personalised media interactions” and are willing to voraciously-consume contents that meet “their preferences, contexts, and schedules.”</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>Now, bearing in mind</b> that the rate at which contents are consumed by consumers determines advert rates, media professionals have learned to redefine their focus by providing the kind of personalised contents the people want.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“In a word, the theme is </i>
        <i>personalisation</i>
        <i>. Consumers are using an expanding array of connected devices to </i>
        <i>organise</i>
        <i>, curate and discover their own unique worlds of media. </i>
        <i>In response</i>
        <i>, companies are designing their offerings to revolve around personal preferences, using data and usage patterns to pitch their products, not at audiences of billions, but separately at billions of individuals.”</i>

      <p><b>Companies’ responses: </b>In view of the foregoing, companies around Africa are now in a better position to redefine their marketing/advertising strategies by targeting consumers via the same channels they like their media contents delivered.</p>
