      <h1>Can you still register to vote in the general election if you're homeless?</h1>
      <address>
        <time datetime="2019-11-20T12:03:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:03</time>
      </address>
      <p>Everyone who wants to vote in the general election must be registered by 26 November – which is Tuesday next week.</p>
      <p>If you’re homeless, don’t have a permanent or fixed address or are currently sofa surfing, you can still register to vote for the 12 December poll.</p>
      <h3>Here’s how…</h3>
      <p>To vote in the general election you must be registered and you need proof of your identity to register.</p>
      <p>This can be your National Insurance number, birth certificate or passport.</p>
      <p>You can still register to vote even if you do not have a fixed address.</p>
      <p>This may be because:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>you are homeless or have no fixed address</li>
        <li>you are a person who has been remanded in custody, but you have not yet been convicted of any offence</li>
        <li>you are a patient in a mental health hospital</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>If you are staying at an address for an extended length of time then you can be considered as residing there and can register for that address. This could be a hospital, hostel, prison facility or similar place.</p>
      <h3>If you haven’t got a fixed address</h3>
      <p>If you are sleeping in a hostel or on the street, you can still vote as long as you’ve registered.</p>
      <p>To register, you need to fill in a form called a ‘Declaration of local connection’.</p>
      <p>You can get this form from your electoral registration office, or download it from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/register-to-vote-if-you-havent-got-a-fixed-or-permanent-address">GOV.UK.</a></p>
      <p>There are two forms – one for people in England and Wales, and one for people in Scotland.</p>
      <p>You may be able to get help filling it in from local homelessness support services.</p>
      <p>You can return this to your electoral registration office by hand, by post or by email. You can find their address at <a href="http://yourvotematters.co.uk/">yourvotematters.co.uk</a></p>

      <h3>What address should you use?</h3>
      <p>To register, you need to give an address and it can be one where you would be living if it were not for your current circumstances.</p>
      <p>It could also be an address where you are staying temporarily or have lived at in the past.</p>
      <p>If you are homeless, you can give details of where you spend a substantial part of your time, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a friend’s house</li>
        <li>a hostel</li>
        <li>a day centre</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Crisis says you could also give an address that is closest to, for example, a park bench, bus shelter or doorway.</p>
      <h3>How to vote on the day</h3>
      <p>If you are eligible and registered to vote you can vote:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>in person at a polling station</li>
        <li>by post</li>
        <li>by proxy - getting someone else to vote for you</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can apply for a postal or proxy vote online or by contacting your electoral registration office.</p>
