      <p><a href="https://estateguru.co/">Real estate crowdfunding platform EstateGuru</a> and OberHaus, real estate agency operating across the Baltic region, have joined together to produce shared real estate market research and analysis with a specialized focus on the needs of the crowdfunding platform.</p>
      <p>A general and combined analysis of the three Baltic markets, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, are expected to be published once a year. Monthly reports of individual countries are set to be published monthly in the future.</p>
      <p>Daniil Aal, Head of Group Sales at EstateGuru, explains that as one of the few crowdfunding platforms in Europe where every loan has a mortgage as security, it’s only natural that to have real estate experts in our team who cooperate with the best real estate companies in the industry.</p>
      <blockquote>“Ober-Haus has vast experience and is the leading expert in the market. When we combine these competencies, we believe we can offer the best quality loans and information to our investors,” says Aal.</blockquote>
      <p>Audrius Šapoka, Managing Director at Ober-Haus Lithuania, explained that his firm has been a frontrunniner in the market and they believe property crowdfunding is here to stay:</p>
      <blockquote>“We see it as a substantial compliment to the real estate development tools in these changing times as traditional banks are not always that flexible and sometimes customers need other solutions. We, at Ober-Haus, see this cooperation as a perfect opportunity to be on the verge of the next era where there are more participants in the market besides traditional banks and real estate companies.”</blockquote>
      <p>EstateGuru is a Pan-European marketplace for short-term, property-backed loans for SMEs. The Fintech is building a new ecosystem of property finance as well as wealth management. Investors may access geographically diversified, professionally underwritten, and property-backed, fixed-income investment products on the platform. EstateGuru reports over 35 000 investors from 106 countries and the total money lent to date is more than €160 million.</p>
