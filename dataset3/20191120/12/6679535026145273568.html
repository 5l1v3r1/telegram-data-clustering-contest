      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:24:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:24</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has resigned from his post, his office said on Wednesday, days after the ruling party’s candidate <b><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gotabaya-rajapaksa-wins-sri-lankan-presidential-election-official-results/article29998767.ece">lost the presidential election to Gotabaya Rajapaksa.</a></b></p>
      <p>In a special statement, the Prime Minister said that he had met President Rajapaksa on Tuesday and discussed the future of Sri Lanka’s Parliament, <i>Colombo Gazette </i>newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>He said that while his Government still has the majority in Parliament, it was decided to respect the mandate given to Mr. Rajapaksa at the Presidential election and step down.</p>
      <p>He was under pressure to quit and hand over the government to the opposite camp after Mr. Rajapaksa won the presidential election on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajapaksa defeated Mr. Wickremesinghe’s deputy Sajith Premadasa.</p>
      <p>Sources said President Rajapaksa will appoint his elder brother and former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, the current main opposition leader, as the next Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Mahinda was appointed the Prime Minister on October 26, 2018 by the then President Maithripala Sirisena, in a controversial move that plunged the country into an unprecedented constitutional crisis.</p>
      <p>He resigned in December as two crucial Supreme Court decisions made the embattled former strongman’s efforts to cling to premiership untenable.</p>
      <p>The apex court later unanimously declared that the dissolution of Parliament by Mr. Sirisena was “illegal”.</p>
      <p>Mahinda won power in 2005 and went on to become South Asia’s longest-serving leader.</p>
