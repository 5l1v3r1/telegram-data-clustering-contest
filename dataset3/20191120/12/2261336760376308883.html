      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov’s next fight is likely against top contender Tony Ferguson. While nothing has been finalized yet, the undefeated lightweight champion says there is already a <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/9/20956774/ufc-mma-news-video-twitter-press-conference-russia-khabib-nurmagomedov-tony-ferguson-fight">95 percent chance</a> of it happening.</p>
      <p>No matter what the result of his fight against “El Cucuy” would be, Khabib is still looking at a possible matchup with Georges St-Pierre.</p>
      <p>Khabib’s manager Rizvan Magomedov recently spoke to <a href="https://www.fightworldturkey.com/rizvan-magomedovdan-onemli-aciklamalar-khabib-ve-zabit/">Fight World Turkey</a> about their plans.</p>
      <p>“Our opponent is definitely Tony Ferguson,” Magomedov said (via <a href="https://middleeasy.com/mma-news/khabib-nurmagomedov-gsp-2/">Middle Easy</a>). “There’s no other name that deserves it. We wanted the GSP fight, but GSP didn’t get along with the UFC. For this reason, our only and most valuable option is Ferguson.</p>
      <p>“However, it is still wrong to say 100% it will be this fight without signing the papers. If the UFC and GSP can negotiate, we want to meet GSP after the Ferguson fight.”</p>
      <p>UFC president Dana White was initially against the pairing, but began seeing the potential of it being a “<a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/3/20896772/ufc-mma-news-interview-president-dana-white-khabib-nurmagomedov-georges-st-pierre-gsp-fight">fun fight</a>” to make.</p>
