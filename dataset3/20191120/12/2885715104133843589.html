      <h2>The India squads for the ODI and T20 series against West Indies next month will be picked on Thursday. Ravichandran Ashwin, who last played a limited-overs game for India in 2017, deserves a comeback, Harbhajan Singh said.</h2>

      <p><a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravichandran-ashwin/">Ravichandran Ashwin</a> deserves the chance to make a comeback to the India squad in white ball cricket, spin great <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/harbhajan-singh/">Harbhajan Singh</a> has said.</p>
      <p>Ashwin has been played as a red ball specialist since 2017 but could be one of the names up for discussion when the selectors meet to pick the squads for the T20Is and ODIs against West Indies on Thursday.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the likes of Washington Sundar and Rahul Chahar, who were part of recent India limited overs squads, Harbhajan said, “If you are looking to bowl a spinner up front (which Sundar has been doing in T20s), you rather have a wicket-taker, which Ashwin is. Why not (give him a chance)? He has also done a good job with the red ball recently.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at the Australian High Commission on Tuesday, Harbhajan told PTI, “Ashwin spins the ball, he has got more variations. Someone like Sundar needs to learn. I want him to do well. I am all for blooding in youngsters but they must learn else they will be replaced, considering the stiff competition.”</p>

      <p>Ashwin and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ravindra-jadeja/">Ravindra Jadeja</a> were both replaced by wrist-spinners Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Chahal in 2017 in terms of India’s plans for the shorter formats. While Jadeja has successfully made a comeback, Ashwin has not.</p>
      <p>However, Harbhajan added that Chahal and Kuldeep remain India’s best bets for providing breakthroughs. “They are your wicket-takers. People who are wicket-takers will always be in the game, be it Kuldeep or Chahal or whoever,” he said.</p>
