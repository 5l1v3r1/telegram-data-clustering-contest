      <p>Radio DJ Adele Roberts is among the famous faces in the jungle for this year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>While she's best known as a presenter on BBC Radio 1, Adele rose to fame as a contestant on series three of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/big-brother/">Big Brother</a>.</p>
      <p>During her time in the house, she found herself embroiled in one of the show's most explosive fights - with none other than late reality star Jade Goody.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In the series that also gave us This Morning favourite Alison Hammond and DJ Kate Lawler, Adele and Jade clashed on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>But perhaps most memorably, the pair locked horns after Jade found she had a verruca on her foot.</p>
      <p>Jade took issue with the way Adele reacted and famously got upset that her housemate allegedly suggested she was "minging".</p>

      <p>When Adele confronted Jade, their housemate Alex Sibley urged her to be more tactful but Adele hit back: "No, I won't be because she's saying I said stuff I didn't say.</p>
      <p>"No, I did not say 'urgh' and at the end of the day, it was someone else who told you to wear flip-flops, not me. Stop [bleeping] making up lies."</p>
      <p>The argument escalated and Adele shouted: "No Jade, don't [bleeping] start, I swear."</p>
      <p>They got up in each others' faces and the row turned into a full-on shouting match, as Adele continued: "Jade, you've got fungus on your skin, that is it. You're drunk! You're the one talking [bleep]. [Bleep] off."</p>

      <p>Ahead of her stint in the jungle, Adele reflected on her time in the Big Brother house and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/adele-roberts-guilt-over-bb-rows-with-jade-goody/">admitted feeling "guilt" over the way she behaved</a>.</p>
      <p>She opened up about feeling like she "let herself down" and said she felt she "could have been a much nicer person".</p>
      <aside>I realised that words are really powerful and you should try and build people up.</aside>
      <p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/im-celebs-adele-roberts-feels-20884537">Mirror</a>, Adele said: "Looking back, I carried a lot of guilt about the way I acted in Big Brother and I feel like I let myself down and I could have been a much nicer person.</p>
      <p>"I just think I judged people when I shouldn't have, I should have tried to get to know them a bit more and I think I probably hurt people when I didn't realise when I was in there.</p>
      <p>"It was only because I've come out that I realised that words are really powerful and you should try and build people up. I just let the game get to me and got too negative and I just won't do that again this time."</p>

      <p>Jade was <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/jade-goody-got-cervical-cancer-diagnosis-on-indian-big-brother/">diagnosed with cervical cancer</a> in 2008 and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/jade-goodys-strength-for-her-son-in-dying-moments-revealed/">lost her battle with the disease on March 22, 2009</a>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Adele said that by appearing on I'm A Celeb, she would like to "show a better side" to herself by treating her campmates well and having a "positive experience".</p>
      <p>And she's been getting on fine with her fellow campmates, although Tuesday's (19.11.19) episode saw her get into <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-spat-over-jane-mcdonald/">a brief argument with DJ Roman Kemp over the framed photo of Loose Women star Jane McDonald</a> she brought into the camp for inspiration.</p>
