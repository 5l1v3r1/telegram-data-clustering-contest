      <p>The Nextbase 522GW is our <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-dash-cam">best dash cam</a> in the world right now, and it's just got even better thanks to this excellent <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a> bundle deal from Very.</p>
      <p>With the ability to capture Full HD video footage at 60fps, or QHD quality video at 30fps, you'll be safe in the knowledge that the Nextbase 522GW is capturing events with crystal-clear video.</p>
      <p>The 3-inch HD touchscreen display allows for easy navigation of the interface, and with a 140 degree field of view, this front-facing camera can see what's happening in the surrounding lanes, as well as in yours.</p>

      <h4>You're getting more than just a dash cam</h4>
      <p>You also get a rear window camera, which can capture crucial footage if you are rear-ended.</p>
      <p>That's not all though, as you also get a 32GB microSD card and a carry case thrown in to this bundle, saving you £60 in total.</p>
      <p>Considering the 522GW is £149.99 on its own, you're basically paying just £10 for the second camera (RRP: £49), case and microSD card - which is a real steal.</p>
