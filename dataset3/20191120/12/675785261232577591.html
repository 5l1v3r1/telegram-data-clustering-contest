      <h1>Aaron Ramsey warns he has unfinished business at Euro 2020 with Wales</h1>
      <h2>Wales booked their place in next summer's Euros with victory over Hungary at the Cardiff City Stadium on Tuesday night thanks to two goals from Aaron Ramsey</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:03:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:03</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey admits he has “unfinished business” at the Euros after firing Wales back to the tournament in memorable style.</p>
      <p>Ramsey returned to the Welsh team to score in each half as they beat Hungary 2-0 in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> to clinch second spot in Group E.</p>
      <p>The Euro 2016 semi-finalists are now waiting for next Saturday's draw to learn their opponents in the summer.</p>
      <p>No-one is more fired up than Ramsey who was in the team of the tournament last time but had to sit out the semi-final loss to Portugal with suspension.</p>
      <p>Asked if he had unfinished business at the Euros, attacking midfielder Ramsey, 28, replied: “Yes.</p>

      <p>“It was a disappointing ending to the Euros for me by missing out on the semi-final.</p>
      <p>“Now I have the opportunity to go out there and express myself again and hopefully we can have another successful run like we did last time.</p>
      <p>“To experience this again now is going to be some journey. We're looking forward to it.”</p>
      <p>Ramsey missed the 2–0 exit to Portugal in France after successive bookings in the knock-out stages to Northern Ireland and Belgium.</p>

      <p>He returned with a bang on his first competitive start for Wales since September 2018 with a brace to climb to joint seventh in the nation's all-time scorers list with 16 goals.</p>
      <p>Ramsey reckons returning to the Euros has helped cushion the blow of Wales failing to make the 2018 World Cup after losing their last qualifier at home to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Ramsey, who has 60 caps, added: “To do back-to-back Euros is something special.</p>
      <p>“It was very disappointing not to make the World Cup.</p>
      <p>“But we learned from that experience of that night to bring it back here and to win in the manner that we did was a nice experience.”</p>
      <p>Ramsey quit <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> after 11 years this summer on a free to move to Italian giants <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> .</p>
      <p>He has only made eight appearances for them and four starts amid injury but he insisted: "I'm enjoying my time over there at the moment.”</p>
