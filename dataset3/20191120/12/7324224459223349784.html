      <p>It’s as part of an ongoing and planned programme of improvements at The Hart School in Rugeley.</p>
      <p>The PVC dome will be created by Covair and work is expected to start on site by January.</p>
      <p>Contractors will spend around two weeks at the Penkridge Bank Road school building the all-weather structure.</p>
      <p>The dome comes on the back of a raft of improvements to the school in the last academic year that’s included creating additional classrooms and teaching spaces, such as a lecture-style theatre, new reception area, open-plan leadership hub, dedicated Sixth Form entrance and common room, as well as new staff and pupil entrances.</p>
      <p>Principal Chris Keen said: “The leisure dome is something myself, staff, pupils and parents are all incredibly excited about.</p>
      <p>“It will enable the children to have access to sports, no matter the weather. We believe this to be just as important to the physical health of our pupils as well as their mental wellbeing as it helps to build self-esteem and fitness as well as many other benefits such as developing teamwork skills.”</p>
      <p>The Hart School will also have the accolade of being only the eighth leisure dome installed by Covair at an educational establishments in the UK - with all of the others erected at either colleges or universities.</p>
      <p>It's also believed to be the first school in Staffordshire to install a dome.</p>
      <p>Mr Keen said: “The dome is part of ongoing improvements to the school building and learning environment which reflect our high expectations across the board - and there will be more to come in 2020.</p>
      <p>“We are fully focused and determined to make The Hart School an exceptional school, the choice for staff, parents and pupils in our community and beyond.”</p>
      <p>Funding for the leisure dome has been supported by Creative Education Trust, which the Hart School is a proud part of.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Surrey-based Covair said: “The Hart School will be the first single skin PVC dome for a school with the first few being installed at David Lloyd.” </p>
      <p>As well as being found at David Lloyd leisure centres, and Virgin Active sites, Covair Leisure domes can also be seen in high-profile locations like at Premier League Football and Rugby Clubs.</p>
