      <p>Traveling <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/03/hold-onto-your-butts-a-tour-through-kualoa-ranch-aka-real-world-jurassic-park/">can be a fun,</a> illuminating experience, but packing for your travels is often stressful. Everything you choose to bring with you on your excursions must have a purpose, because unnecessary items do not belong in anyone's cramped suitcase. Whether you're traveling for business or pleasure, it can be difficult to decide which pieces of tech deserve to come with you and which you only <i>think</i> would be useful.</p>
      <p>It can also be hard to find gadgets that are suitable for travel—devices that work even more efficiently when you're not in your normal environment. To combat this, Ars has picked out some of the best travel tech gifts that will be solid additions to anyone's travel bag. All of the items below we've personally tested or reviewed, so we're confident saying that none of these devices will end up languishing, abandoned, at the bottom of your suitcase.</p>

      <h3>Dell XPS 13</h3>

        <figcaption>Dell's XPS 13 laptop.<br/>Valentina Palladino</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Dell has crafted and re-crafted the <a href="http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8984087-12578053?sid=TravelGifts2019&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Flaptops%2Fnew-13%2Fspd%2Fxps-13-7390-laptop">XPS 13</a> to be one of the most travel-friendly laptops you can get. Weighing 2.7 pounds and measuring 11.6mm thick, it's impressively thin considering how much power it has built inside the chassis. The 2019 model with 9th-gen Intel processors is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/guidemaster-the-best-windows-ultrabooks-you-can-buy-right-now/">our current favorite Windows ultrabook</a>, and Dell recently updated the machine to include 10th-gen Intel processors. Regardless of the model you get, you're getting a Windows laptop that doesn't compromise performance while being slim and attractive.</p>
      <p>That said, the newest XPS 13 does offer a lot of improvements over last year's model. First and foremost, the webcam has been moved to the top of the screen rather than sitting on the bottom like it has for so many years. This makes the webcam much more functional, and Dell didn't sacrifice screen space in order to make it happen. You can get the display in a 1080p panel, but there's a 4K panel option as well now. In terms of ports, you get three USB-C ports (two of which are Thunderbolt 3) in addition to a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, and a lock slot.</p>
      <p>While we wish the XPS 13 had an IR camera for facial recognition, it does have a fingerprint reader embedded into the power button, so you'll get speedy biometric login from that. We also appreciate that the 4K model can last 13 hours on a single charge (according to our testing), and you could configure the XPS 13 to get up to 21 hours of battery life.</p>
      <p>Dell gives you a lot of configuration options on the XPS 13, making it a good choice for anyone who wants to truly customize their laptop. The only bad part is that the base model starts with 4GB of RAM (the next step up has 8GB of RAM, and we would recommend most people have that amount of memory in their primary machine). Regardless of how you configure it, the XPS 13 is a solid laptop that will be a workhorse no matter where you find yourself working.</p>
      <p>For those who want a machine that's a bit more flexible (plus a tad thinner and lighter), consider the Microsoft Surface Pro. Last year's <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-6-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i5-8gb-memory-128gb-solid-state-drive-platinum%2F6298148.p%3FskuId%3D6298148&amp;subid1=TravelGifts2019">Surface Pro 6</a> is our current favorite Windows detachable, and you can still find powerful configurations of this device at a good price. Those who want the latest and greatest (plus a newly added USB-C port) should consider the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1305166/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-7-12-3-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-4gb-memory-128gb-ssd-with-black-type-cover-latest-model-platinum%2F6374985.p%3FskuId%3D6374985&amp;subid1=TravelGifts2019">Surface Pro 7</a>.</p>

      <h3>Logitech MX Master Anywhere 2s</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Travel-friendly mice are a dime a dozen, but <a href="https://amzn.to/2NDodMM">Logitech's MX Master Anywhere 2s</a> puts some of the best features found in a stationary mouse into a travel-sized device. This mouse is noticeably smaller than other Logitech mice, and while it may take some getting used to, it's the perfect sized mouse to live in your backpack, work, or travel bag.</p>
      <p>Its 4000 dpi Darkfield sensor helps it track on nearly any surface, even glass, so you can use it no matter where you find yourself working. It has a rechargeable battery that should last up to 70 days on a single charge, and it recharges using a microUSB port. It works with macOS and Windows devices, as well as iPadOS and Linux, and you can pair this mouse with up to three devices at once and switch between them with just the press of a button. Like most Logitech accessories, the MX Master Anywhere 2s connects to a PC via Bluetooth or a USB receiver.</p>
      <p>In addition to customizable pointer and scroll speeds, you can also customize the five buttons on the MX Master Anywhere 2s. This is one of the features I love in Logitech's main mice, and I'm glad the company made a travel mouse that works almost exactly like the one you may use every day at your main desk. The MX Master Anywhere 2s could end up being your main mouse if you prefer smaller mice, but it's truly hard to beat as a travel mouse—especially at the good price of $54.99.</p>

      <h3>Anker PowerCore 10000 PD Redux</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/anker-powercore-10000-pd-redux-1280x796.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Anker's PowerCore 10000 PD Redux portable battery next to a Google Pixel 3a.<br/>Jeff Dunn</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There are countless power banks that can effectively keep devices charged on the go, but for an explicitly portable option, we like <a href="https://amzn.to/2NZBf7u">Anker’s PowerCore 10000 PD Redux</a>. The main reason for that is size: at seven ounces and 106×52.3×25.5mm, the PowerCore is particularly small and light enough to fit into many pants pockets, let alone a handbag or suitcase, without being too obtrusive. The whole thing is sturdily put together, with rounded edges that subtly make the battery more comfortable to hold and stash on your person.</p>
      <p>Besides that, it includes a USB-C Power Delivery (PD) port that charges at 18W, which is powerful enough to refill most new smartphones at maximum speeds. (It’s not quite fast enough to recharge higher-end tablets like the iPad Pro at maximum speeds, but it’ll still speed up the process to an extent.) There’s a 12W USB-A port as well, which is handy if you have multiple devices low on power. Because the battery maxes out at 18W of output, it’s best suited for smartphone charging above all else, though.</p>
      <p>The PowerCore has a capacity of 10,000mAh (36Wh), which is enough to charge an iPhone 11 roughly twice. A quartet of LED lights lets you know how much of that capacity is left at any given time, and the battery itself can recharge at 18W with a USB-C PD wall charger, so it doesn’t take long to fully restore. We’ve had no hints of reliability issues after months of use, and Anker generally has a strong reputation in this market, but the device is covered by an 18-month warranty if something goes wrong. At $46, it’s not the cheapest power bank in its class, but it does come with a USB-C to USB-C cable in the box, and we think its blend of good-enough power and genuine portability is worth it.</p>

      <h3>Garmin Dash Cam Mini</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Protecting your car with the watchful eye of a dash cam can be useful if you're on the road a lot, and <a href="https://amzn.to/32EjdeQ">Garmin's Dash Cam Mini</a> is certainly one of the most compact dash cams you can get. Measuring 1.23×2.1×1.15 inches, it's about the size of a house key and almost as lightweight as one. Its camera records 1080p video @ 30fps of the road ahead of you, and its 140-degree field of view will capture almost everything going on in the area in front of your car.</p>
      <p>It's also one of the most convenient dash cams to use. Just stick the Dash Cam Mini onto your windshield, plug it into your car's charger, and forget about it—it will start when the car starts, record continuously, and stop when the car stops. Garmin's companion mobile app makes it easy to view and access footage relatively quickly, too. While other dash cams force you to remove the microSD card and use it to view footage on a computer, you can see new clips immediately in the Garmin Drive app and download them to your smartphone. There are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/guidemaster-the-best-dash-cams-to-guard-your-every-drive/">plenty of dash cams</a> out there to choose from—some more affordable, some more expensive—but Garmin's Dash Cam Mini will appeal to those who want an unobtrusive device that also doesn't get in the way of them accessing their driving footage whenever necessary.</p>

      <h3>Sony WH-1000XM3</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sony-1-1280x853.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Sony's WH-1000XM3 noise-cancelling headphones.<br/>Jeff Dunn</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While more than a year old now, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WH1000XM3-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Over-the-Ear-Headphones-with-Google-Assistant%2F931234733&amp;subid1=TravelGifts2019">Sony’s WH-1000XM3</a> remains our favorite wireless noise-cancelling headphone. It has the most powerful and consistent active noise cancellation (ANC) of any model we’ve tested: some sharper sounds may sneak through during quieter tracks, but that’s the case with every ANC headphone, and the XM3 is still outstanding at shutting out the low- and mid-range noises that are most disturbing on a long flight or subway ride.</p>
      <p>While the XM3 is not the best-sounding $350 headphone we’ve used by any means, sound quality in consumer headphones as a whole has taken a bit of a backseat as Bluetooth has become the norm. Sony’s profile here is tailored toward bass lovers more than purists, but that’s not exactly an unpopular sound these days, and the XM3 is well-measured given the warmer sound it’s going for. Those who are willing to sacrifice a little treble and vocal clarity for more oomph in the low-end will find plenty to like. That said, Sony’s companion app lets you customize the XM3’s sound in meaningful ways, so if your loved one doesn’t like the default sound (or wants even more bass), it’s not hard to address that.</p>
      <p>The XM3 is primarily made of plastic, which might be disappointing for the price, but the upshot is that it keeps the whole thing relatively light. Combined with the cushy, not-overly-tight earpads and a headband, this keeps the XM3 comfortable to wear for hours at a time. The headphone got a solid 21 hours of battery life during our testing, and it can fully recharge in about two hours through its USB-C port. It also supports a nifty “ambient sound” mode that can let you hear outside noises without stopping whatever’s playing.</p>
      <p>The XM3 is not without flaws. Unlike the <a href="https://amzn.to/2O0bm7x">Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700</a>, there’s no way to manually adjust the strength of the XM3’s noise cancellation. The Bose 700 also has a more premium-feeling design, with a stainless steel headband. <a href="https://amzn.to/2qZZbhT">Bose’s QuietComfort 35 II</a>, meanwhile, has physical volume and playback buttons that are generally more reliable than the XM3’s touch-based controls—though we find the XM3’s setup to work fine for what it is—an even lighter design, and a sound profile that’ll appeal more to those who don’t want as much bass. But the Bose 700 are too reliant on a finicky app for crucial functions, the QC 35 II’s sound is less customizable and impressive on the whole, and the XM3 has stronger ANC than both of them. It’s possible Sony will release a follow-up in the next few months, but either way, the XM3 should be a treat for anyone who is frequently stuck on long commutes.</p>

      <h3>Beats Powerbeats Pro<br/>Apple AirPods Pro</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/beats-powerbeats-pro-and-apple-airpods-pro-1280x854.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>The Beats Powerbeats Pro (left) and Apple AirPods Pro.<br/>Jeff Dunn</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>If over-ear headphones like the WH-1000XM3 are too bulky for your loved one’s liking, consider gifting them a pair of “true wireless” earphones. Easily the trendiest item in consumer audio nowadays, these are Bluetooth earphones with absolutely no wires between them. Almost none of them are well-suited to critical listening at this point, but their small size and total lack of cables make them feel particularly freeing for someone who is frequently on the move.</p>
      <p>A handful of worthwhile options have launched in the past year, but we think the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPowerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones-Black%2F128591554%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_TGh06tQMUxyJWYpwUx0Mo38zUkn1o4RtI2tCQ40%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1305166%26clickid%3DTGh06tQMUxyJWYpwUx0Mo38zUkn1o4RtI2tCQ40&amp;subid1=TravelGifts2019">Beats Powerbeats Pro</a> will make the widest swath of people happy. As you might expect from a Beats product, the Powerbeats Pro’s sound is heavy on the bass and far from neutral, but it doesn’t totally muddle up detail in the mids. Given the context, it sounds more “fun” than bloated.</p>
      <p>It’s the other fundamentals that really make the Powerbeats Pro a winner, though: the earhook design balances its weight well and stays nice and secure throughout intense workouts, the physical volume and playback controls mirrored on each earbud are always convenient to access, and the semi-sealing eartips block out enough outside noise with music playing without putting too much stress on the ear canals or totally shutting off access to your surroundings. For iPhone users, they use Apple’s H1 wireless chip for a particularly stable connection and easier pairing, but even on Android they connect quickly to a remembered device and don’t lose any major features.</p>
      <p>Best of all, the Powerbeats Pro are <i>by far</i> the current battery life champ among true wireless earbuds, getting more than 11 hours of continuous use in our testing. By contrast, most of the major competitors we’ve tested have averaged somewhere between 4-6 hours on a charge. It’s a shame that their case is enormous—you’ll likely need to keep it in a jacket pocket, bag, or purse on the road—and the fact that the case charges over Lightning instead of USB-C might be an annoyance. At $250, they aren’t cheap, either. Still, the Powerbeats Pro live up to the promise of being genuinely wire-free better than most of their peers.</p>
      <p>If your loved one likes the true wireless idea but doesn’t want to give up active noise cancellation, however, we can also give <a href="https://amzn.to/3416Cns">Apple’s AirPods Pro</a> our blessing. We’re wrapping up an in-depth review of these earphones now, but the short version is that they’re an improvement over the standard AirPods in both comfort and sound quality—as they should be, considering they cost $100 more—and they offer more effective active noise cancellation than other true wireless earbuds like <a href="https://amzn.to/2CX5u8y">Amazon’s Echo Buds</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/32Yk0Yf">Sony’s WF-1000XM3</a>. (Yes, Sony’s naming conventions are bad.) The “transparency” mode that artificially lets in outside noise works well, and their case can actually fit in most pants pockets.</p>
      <p>But you should only consider the AirPods Pro if you must have that blend of ANC and true wireless design. Their battery life, at roughly five hours a charge, isn’t enough to last through a cross-country flight. The touch-sensor-based controls are less intuitive than Beats’ physical buttons, and they don’t offer any way to adjust volume without using your phone or talking to Siri (which few people want to do in public). Many of their customization settings are simply inaccessible if you don’t have an iOS device on you. And that ANC, while good, is still inferior in a vacuum to what you get from full-size headphones like the Sony and Bose models above. All that said, they do a better job of justifying their inevitable popularity than the ordinary AirPods do.</p>

      <p>For those times when the music needs to be shared, <a href="https://amzn.to/2XqzX8s">UE’s Wonderboom 2</a> is a cute, effective, and supremely portable Bluetooth speaker. It measures 104mm high and 95.3mm wide, with a squat design that looks like a small candle holder, so it shouldn’t be tough to toss into a backpack or carry-on. It’s IP67-rated—meaning it’s dustproof and waterproof—and its rugged design can withstand five-foot drops and float in water. An elastic loop built into the speaker allows it to hang from a carabiner (or towel hook), and its huge volume buttons and playback buttons make it largely straightforward to operate.</p>
      <p>This is still a small Bluetooth speaker, so it doesn’t sound <i>amazing</i>, but it plays loud for its size, produces some semblance of bass, and does particularly well at keeping vocals and other mids clear. Don’t expect it to totally avoid distortion at maximum volume, but it sounds cleaner than most sub-$100 speakers. Its nine or so hours of battery life isn’t spectacular, and we’d prefer it charge over USB-C instead of microUSB, but it shouldn’t die out so quickly that it becomes an annoyance.</p>

      <p>DJI's newest gimbal is a great gift for that person in your life who's forever the photographer of your group, the person who's always first to whip out their smartphone to document events in photos or videos. Much of what has made DJI gimbals great remains in the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDJI-Osmo-Mobile-3-Foldable-Mobile-Gimbal%2F562970196&amp;subid1=TravelGifts2019">Osmo Mobile 3</a>, but the company made this device more compact and more affordable at $119.</p>
      <p>The Osmo Mobile 3 folds into itself with one swift motion, reducing it to a size that can easily be stored in a purse or backpack. Although you must rebalance your smartphone each time before using the device, the stabilization is solid, and the accompanying mobile app gives you a ton of ways to shoot video. We particularly like DJI's object tracking, which smoothly tracks the object you tap on in the frame even while you're moving your smartphone camera. You can even charge your smartphone while using it in the Osmo Mobile 3 via the newly included USB port—and with 15 hours of estimated battery life, the Osmo Mobile 3 will likely have some juice to share even while working hard for you.</p>

      <p>Readers who want to take their libraries with them while they travel will get a lot of use out of <a href="https://amzn.to/2KaQp7u">Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite</a>. The paperback-sized e-reader can hold thousands of e-books, and the newest model also holds Audible audiobooks, allowing you to listen to books with a pair of Bluetooth headphones.</p>
      <p>The Paperwhite may not provide the tactile satisfaction that reading a physical book does, but it's at least as comfortable if not more. Not only is it lighter than most hardbacks, but its E-Ink display with multiple front lights makes digital reading easy on the eyes (and as close as you'll get to real paper on an electronic device). At $129, it's a gift that won't break the bank and will keep on giving for years to come. But if that's more than your budget will allow, the new $89 Kindle provides the same reading experience, just with a less pixel-dense display and no Audible integration.</p>

      <h3>Nintendo Switch Lite</h3>

        <figcaption>The Nintendo Switch Lite.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>While the original Nintendo Switch was (and still is) a convenient portable console, the new <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Console-Gray%2F907697007&amp;subid1=TravelGifts2019">Nintendo Switch Lite</a> is just a bit better-suited for gaming on the go. It's slightly smaller and lighter than the original Switch, and it can play nearly all of the games that the original console can. We say "nearly" mostly because the lack of TV docking in the Switch Lite will make some games a bit more difficult to play—though it is possible.</p>
      <p>But all the major titles like <a href="https://amzn.to/2KjRwBM"><i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i></a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2pFiuNi"><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/37s2jEb"><i>Luigi's Mansion 3</i></a>, and others for the Switch can be played on the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/nintendo-switch-lite-is-the-best-portable-system-nintendo-has-ever-made/">Switch Lite</a>, and the enhanced portability of the latter lets you bring that gameplay wherever you go. Gameplay isn't hindered by the smaller, 5.5-inch, 1280 x 720p display on the Switch Lite, and the newly added d-pad on the left side is a huge improvement over the small directional buttons that sit in its place on the original Switch.</p>
      <p>Most sacrifices made in the Switch Lite do not detrimentally affect portable gameplay. The joycons cannot be removed, nor do they have HD rumble or IR sensors, but those features become less important when you're playing on your own and on the go. The biggest downside is that you can't dock the Switch Lite to a TV for larger-screen gameplay. But if you're wanting primarily to play Nintendo titles while on the road, during your commute, or while generally out and about, the Switch Lite is the better option and costs $100 less than the original Switch.</p>

      <h3>Apple iPad Air (3rd gen)</h3>

      <p>An iPad is an iPad. You don’t need us to tell you that it remains an ideal computing device for watching movies, reading e-books, browsing the Web, and getting light work done on the go. But with Apple refreshing much of its tablet lineup over the past year, the question of <i>which</i> iPad is best for most people has gotten murkier.</p>
      <p>As it stands now, we’re going with <a href="https://amzn.to/2KvQCCb">the iPad Air</a>. At $499, it costs a fair bit more than the <a href="https://amzn.to/2r2c5fk">new 10.2-inch iPad</a>—which starts at $329, though both tablets can often be found discounted online—but that premium gets you a number of meaningful quality of life improvements.</p>
      <p>The big one is processing power. While the 10.2-inch iPad comes with the same A10 Fusion chip that was introduced with the iPhone 7 in 2016, the iPad Air runs on an A12 Bionic chip that’s two generations newer and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/mini-review-the-2019-ipad-has-a-new-skin-but-its-mostly-the-same-tablet/">performs significantly better in benchmarks</a>. To be clear, the 10.2-inch iPad is still powerful enough to do most of the things you’d expect an iPad to do without immediate issue, and it pairs its processor with the same 3GB of RAM as the iPad Air. But the Air is quicker with games and more intensive tasks, and it’s better equipped to handle iPadOS updates as the years roll along. Since an iPad is designed to last several years, that last bit is what’s most important.</p>
      <p>Beyond that, the iPad Air’s display is a noticeable step up. It’s laminated, for one, so it doesn’t have the air gap that makes the 10.2-inch iPad’s screen look recessed behind the glass that covers it. It has an anti-reflective coating that makes it more convenient to use in sunlight, support for Apple’s TrueTone display tech—which automatically adjusts colors onscreen to better suit the lighting of your surroundings—and a wider P3 color gamut. The iPad Air’s display is also marginally larger, at 10.5 inches, despite having a smaller overall footprint. (It’s 6.1mm thin, compared to the 7.5mm chassis of the 10.2-inch iPad.) Both tablets have LCD panels with virtually the same resolution, and again, your loved one will likely be perfectly content with the standard model’s display if they never see the two slates side by side. But a tablet is nothing if not a big display, and the iPad Air’s is just more pleasant to look at.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the iPad Air comes with 64GB of storage by default, double the amount of the entry-level iPad. Its front-facing camera is significantly sharper and supports 1080p video, whereas the 10.2-inch iPad’s selfie cam maxes out at 720p. It’s slightly lighter, at 456g compared to the iPad’s 483g, and it’s no worse with battery life.</p>
      <p>If you simply want to save cash, the standard iPad is still a fine tablet, with the same support for <a href="https://amzn.to/2OnVhaK">Apple’s first-gen Pencil stylus</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/37knaZF">Smart Keyboard attachment</a>. The <a href="https://amzn.to/37eVwxk">iPad Mini</a> is basically a smaller iPad Air for the niche that still prefers a 7.9-inch tablet, and if you can find the discontinued 10.5-inch iPad Pro for a decent price from a reputable retailer, it’s a better piece of hardware than any current midrange model. (The <a href="https://amzn.to/330Gh7K">iPad Pro</a>, meanwhile, is still too expensive for most use cases and positioned more as a Windows laptop alternative.) But for most would-be iPad owners, the iPad Air is the best blend of performance, size, and build quality. If nothing else, it’ll be a smoother ride than almost any Android tablet in this price range.</p>
