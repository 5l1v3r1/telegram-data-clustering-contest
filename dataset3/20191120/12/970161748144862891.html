      <p>Former Gladiator Ace opened up to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> about his short-lived engagement to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a>.</p>
      <p>The bodybuilder was engaged to the pin-up in the late 1990s, when Price was at the height of her fame as Jordan.</p>
      <p>The pair were engaged in 1997 but broke up soon after, with Ace (real name Warren Furman) splashing out on over £3,000 for the ring.</p>
      <p>Joining the This Morning sofa, the TV star opened up about the relationship.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘We were very similar people,’ Furman began. ‘[We] both grew up in similar circumstances – working class.’</p>
      <p>‘We both took our clothes off for a living in a way,’ he continued. ‘I wore the lycra. We had a lot of time together as well.’</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old also admitted fame was a huge aspect of their relationship – something that he said he struggled with.</p>

      <p>‘We were both deriving our identities from being relevant in the media,’ he explained. ‘We were both selling stories.’</p>
      <p>Life for the Gladiator, however, has changed significantly since he was a Saturday night prime time TV superstar. He opened up to Holly and Phil about finding religion after becoming disillusioned with fame.</p>
      <p>‘I went on a spiritual search because I thought celebrity culture would fulfill me but it was actually quite lonely,’ he told the presenting duo.</p>
      <p>‘Nobody told me the gospel so when I looked at the true gladiator story, it was Jesus’ teaching that closed the gladiator [pits].’</p>
      <p>Pricey also hit the headlines today after declaring war against I’m A Celebrity spin-off host Emily Atack.</p>
      <p>During Tuesday’s Extra Camp, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebs-emily-atack-makes-dig-katie-price-peter-andres-former-relationship-11182002/">the former Inbetweeners star threw shade at Katie and </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/peter-andre/">Peter Andre</a> by joking that presenters Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas needed to get tested for diseases after plunging into the same pool that the former couple first kissed in.</p>

      <p>‘This is where Katie Price and Peter Andre had fondles,’ Joel proudly boasted to his co-host. But back in the studio, Emily teased: ‘I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool.’</p>
      <p>A source said: ‘She was telling people that she can’t believe Emily would say something so snide and if she “wants a problem, I’ll give her a problem”.’</p>
      <p>Eek!</p>
