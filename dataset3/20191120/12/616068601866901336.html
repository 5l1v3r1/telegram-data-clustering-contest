      <p>The City of Penticton has revealed its proposed options for a lake-to-lake cycling route.</p>
      <p>A technical review has detailed several ways to move commuter cyclists through the city, weighing the impact bike lanes have on loss in lanes for traffic or parking. </p>
      <p>“Our consultants reviewed a number of possible streets to identify options that meet the technical and safety requirements of an ‘all ages and abilities’ cycling route,” said city engineer Ian Chapman.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a good starting point for our discussions with the community and are looking forward to hearing what residents and businesses think about the route options proposed for affected neighbourhoods.”</p>
      <p>It appears the most difficult area to fit bike lanes will be in the downtown core, where the review has suggested Winnipeg, Martin, Main or Ellis Streets could be used. </p>
      <p>“There is no option that is clearly more appealing than the others, as all options involve some impacts,” the city report says. </p>
      <p>The route would then use Fairview Road to send cyclists down either Atkinson Street or Quebec Street.</p>
      <p>There are options aplenty in the south end of the city, with Paris, Wilson and McKenzie Streets suggested as well as Cornwall Drive and South Main Street.</p>
      <p>The city suggests a mix of protected bike lanes and cycling boulevards, which would be improved upon once the route is actually established rather than completing the route in piecemeal fashion.</p>
      <p>A map of the proposed routes and full technical report can be found <a href="https://www.shapeyourcitypenticton.ca/lake-to-lake-cycling-route">here</a>. </p>
      <p>The plan avoids major roads such as Main Street outside the downtown and Skaha Lake Road due to the number of intersections and driveways, while Industrial was avoided due to heavy truck traffic. Cyclists have been calling for a lake-to-lake route for years, as the Channel walkway serves a more recreational purpose and sits outside the city.</p>
      <p>The municipality says the options have been vetted by local traffic safety experts and stakeholders representing ICBC, BC Transit, RCMP, the business community and local cyclists.</p>
      <p>The city is holding open houses on the route, along with other topics, on  Dec. 4, 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at PTCC and Dec. 5, 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the Seniors’ Drop-In Centre.</p>
