      <h1>German state of Brandenburg gets centrist ‘Kenya’ coalition</h1>
      <h2>Social Democrats agree to team-up with other centrist parties, but far-right will be strongest local opposition.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:35:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Posaner, Judith Mischke</a></address>
      <p>BERLIN — The German state of Brandenburg got a new government Wednesday, with the Social Democrats leading a centrist administration.</p>
      <p>The so-called Kenya coalition — as the colors associated with each party match the African nation's flag — also includes the Christian Democratic Union and the Greens.</p>
      <p>It's a rare piece of good news for the SPD, which is in the process of a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/future-of-germanys-groko-uncertain-after-spd-vote/">national leadership battle</a> with polls due to close in a run-off on November 29. Once a major force in German politics, the party has seen its support fall away in a number of national and regional elections over the last few years, including in the European Parliament as well as <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/germanys-social-democrats-cling-to-power-in-bremen/">Bremen</a> and other <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/german-far-right-afd-surges-in-eastern-elections/">former East German states</a>.</p>
      <p>Voters in <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/german-vote-periphery-center-brandenburg/">Brandenburg</a>, a mostly rural state of 2.5 million including former coal mining hotspots along the Polish border, voted in droves for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the September ballot. The AfD surged into second place with 23.5 percent of the vote, just behind the SPD on 26.2 percent, which saw its support decline. The CDU, with 15.6 percent, saw its backing fall too, while the Greens increased their share to 10.8 percent.</p>
      <p>The SPD had previously governed in Brandenburg with the left-wing Die Linke as junior coalition partner.</p>
      <p>"This government will be a stable government, also because the coalition partners are very open and constructive," said Dietmar Woidke, the SPD's returning prime minister, according to the <a href="https://www.morgenpost.de/berlin/article227699091/Woidke-zeigt-sich-trotz-moeglicher-Abweichler-zufrieden.html">DPA</a>.</p>
