      <p>Former Scotland footballer <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/duncan-ferguson-says-his-crazy-days-858553">Duncan Ferguson</a> spoken about his time behind bars in a rare interview, claiming he should never have been sent there.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/former-everton-kid-recalls-incredible-12668403">The ex-Rangers striker</a> became the first and only professional player in Britain to be jailed for an on-field offence after he headbutted John McStay, the Raith Rovers defender, during a match at Ibrox in 1994.</p>
      <p>The following year he was convicted of assault at Glasgow Sheriff <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/man-appears-court-accused-raping-20912111">Court</a> and sentenced to three months.</p>

      <p>He spent 44 days in the city's Barlinnie prison before being released. <br/> </p>
      <p>However in a rare interview, Ferguson has described the headbutt as "nothing" and claimed he should not have been made an example of.</p>
      <p>He was jailed only five months after winning the FA Cup with his new club Everton and the 47-year-old said letters from the Merseyside club's fans helped him get through his time locked up.</p>
      <p>He said: "It was wrong me being there, it wasn't fair.</p>
      <p>"I shouldn't have been in there and I think a lot of people understood that. <br/> </p>
      <p>"It's not as if I was in for doing anything bad really. My God, it was nothing.</p>
      <p>"The fans got me through it, a lot of them wrote to me. It was unbelievable all the letters and the support that I got.</p>
      <p>"I got all the letters when I was in there and obviously you have got a lot of time on your hands when you're in there to read through them all.</p>
      <p>"It definitely gets you through it and you never forget those things."</p>

      <p>Speaking to Everton fans' channel Toffee TV, Ferguson said he grew a beard at the time as he wanted to look "tough" during his stint in the notorious Glasgow jail.</p>
      <p>He added: "It made me look tough. When you're going to one of they hotels up there you've got to look tough."</p>
      <p>Ferguson, who is now a coach at Everton and does community work for the club, also said his hardman reputation was unfair.</p>
      <p>He said: "You get a reputation and you can't shake it off. It follows you around and it follows you around.</p>
      <p>"I don't see myself as that person. I see myself as the person I see off the field and I try to give as much back as I possibly can to the city because it's gave me so much."</p>

      <p>His prison sentence was for his third conviction for assault and saw him banned for 12 games by the Scottish Football Association(SFA) - leading him to refuse to play for the national team again.</p>
      <p>Ferguson was born in Stirling and began his career with Dundee United, before moving to Rangers in 1993.</p>
      <p>He arrived at Everton in 1994 and won an FA Cup medal the following year when they beat Manchester United 1-0.</p>
      <p>Despite a career disrupted by injuries he was a cult hero on Merseyside.</p>
      <p>In the interview, he blamed his injury-plagued career on breaking his big toe during a pub fight in Dundee when he was aged 18.</p>
      <p>He said: "The first injury I ever had was when I broke my big toe.</p>
      <p>"I broke it in a fight in a pub called The Rock in Menzieshill in Dundee.</p>
