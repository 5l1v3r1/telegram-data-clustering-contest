      <p>Amaravati: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Andhra-Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> Chief Minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Y.S.-Jagan-Mohan-Reddy">Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy</a> said, here on Wednesday, three concept cities would be developed and asked officials to plan that in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Vishakapatnam">Vishakapatnam</a>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Tirupati">Tirupati</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Anantapur">Anantapur</a>.</p>
      <p>These cities should be developed in a radius of 10 sq km, he added.</p>
      <p>Reddy said this during a review meeting with officials of the Information Technology, Electronics and Communications Department.</p>
      <p>He also asked officials to make village and ward secretariats and the volunteers system tech-savvy.</p>
      <p>Outlining the importance of village and ward secretariats, he said the system would help root out corruption and hence it needed a strong IT network. Ration cards, pension cards, Arogyasri cards and fee reimbursement cards would be issued by the village and ward secretariats, he said.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister said the single-window system had been introduced for transparency in sanctioning of industries. Land, water and power would be provided at nominal rates for setting up industries, he added.</p>
      <p>He slammed <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/N.-Chandrababu-Naidu">N. Chandrababu Naidu</a>, leader of opposition, for making tall claims about industrial promotion and ease of doing business but keeping Rs 4,000 crore industrial incentives pending during his five-year rule.</p>
      <p>IT Minister Mekatpati Goutham Reddy and other officials were also present.</p>
