      <p>Pupils at Tidcombe Primary have proven to be the best bookworms in Tiverton once again.</p>
      <p>The school has won the Summer Reading Challenge for the third consecutive year.</p>
      <p>Head of English and assistant headteacher, Jill Mallender said: “Summer may seem like a distant memory, but for children and staff we are still celebrating.</p>
      <p>“The popular event takes place every year over the six week summer holiday, and it is organised by Tiverton Library.</p>
      <p>“Tidcombe School is one of the smaller Primary schools in Tiverton with just 194 children currently on roll, but, size obviously does not matter for these little bookworms.</p>
      <p>“We are all so proud of our children, and as a school, we are very passionate about encouraging our children to read. We have super supportive parents who share our drive to promote reading every evening and would like to say a special thank you to them, for helping the children to achieve this award for the third year running.”</p>
