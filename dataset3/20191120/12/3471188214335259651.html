      <p>Staying connected through phone and internet services is important for the safety of residential and business customers in areas impacted by natural disasters.</p>
      <p>TIO Ombudsman Judi Jones said:</p>
      <blockquote>“For local residents, remaining connected to phone and internet services means being able to contact emergency services, stay connected to medical assistance, and remain in touch with friends, family and neighbours.<br/><br/>For small businesses it means being able to continue trading, supplying goods and providing a vital network for members of the community”.</blockquote>
      <p>The TIO says people in natural disaster areas who’s telecommunication services are impacted should contact their provider first. Many telecommunications providers are offering specific relief packages or assistance for their customers affected by the bush fires.</p>
