        <b>A new Netflix spin-off of smash-hit show Vikings will be filmed in County Wicklow.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vikings: Valhalla will follow "the explosive next chapter of the Vikings legend".</p>
      <p>The new series will pick up 100 years after the conclusion of the original series.</p>
      <p>It's set to follow "the adventures of the most famous Vikings who ever lived — Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Harada and the Norman King William the Conqueror".</p>
      <p>The new series will be filmed at Ashford Studios in Wicklow, the same place where the original series was filmed.</p>

      <p>Executive producer Michael Hirst said: "Jeb Stuart, a truly wonderful writer, will bring new story-lines and a powerful visceral vision to stories about some of the most famous Vikings known to history.</p>
      <p>"I am so happy that we are returning to Ireland and Ashford Studios in glorious County Wicklow, which has been our home for the last eight years."</p>
      <p>He added: "Our Irish crew, in my opinion, is the best and most professional crew in the world. And it has been a particular joy to me, shared with my producer Morgan O’Sullivan, that we have been able to give continuous employment to many hundreds of Irish men and women.</p>
      <p>"Ireland is well known for its support of writers and drama and Vikings has benefitted, and will now continue to benefit, from both that cultural and financial support. Making a great show isn’t a mechanical activity; it’s a human one!"</p>
      <p>The sixth, and final, season of Vikings will air in December.</p>
