      <h2>100th anniversary of Ambrose Quinn's execution also sees launch of Newcastle University research project into notorious Carliol Square prison</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tony Henderson</a></address>
      <p>Next week sees the 100th anniversary of the last execution to take place in Newcastle – and the launch of a Newcastle University research project into the city’s prison in Carliol Square, where the execution of Ambrose Quinn took place.</p>
      <p>On November 26, 1919, after returning from service as a corporal in the Royal Air Force, 28-year-old Ambrose Quinn was hanged for murdering his wife, whom he had suspected of being unfaithful.</p>
      <p>He was the second man to be executed that morning. Ernest Bernard Scott, also 28, was hanged earlier for murdering his wife.</p>
      <p>Both men died instantaneously after a 7ft drop from the gallows and were buried in unmarked graves in the prison yard.</p>
      <p>Six years later the gaol was closed and demolished.</p>
      <p>Dr Shane McCorristine, lecturer in history at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-university">Newcastle University</a>, says: “We know that in its final years, the gaol was surrounded by homes, pubs and even a school. We want to hear from anyone who can help us tell the story of Carliol Square and the history of crime and punishment in Newcastle.”</p>
      <p>Designed by John Dobson, Newcastle gaol was among the first prisons to use a system of radial wings, seen as a progressive design that would help reform rather than punish offenders.</p>
      <p>However, the high construction costs meant that only five of the six radial wings were built. The prison opened in 1828 but within 10 years it was condemned for being damp, rat-infested and overcrowded, with several escapes having taken place.</p>
      <p>Dobson’s original design featured a fortress-style central tower, formidable entry gate and 40ft high walls. Later, due to the poor conditions and rapidly expanding prison population, Dobson was asked to replace the wings with a single four-storey block of 144 cells.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the issues the prison was facing were down to its location near the centre of a rapidly expanding Newcastle,” Dr McCorristine said. “The prison population soared due to the population growth, as well as a general increase in policing.”</p>
      <p>In the gaol, communication with other prisoners was banned, as was the bartering of provisions. Prisoners were required to carry out hard, monotonous work which if they completed successfully, could earn them a slightly better diet and a hammock instead of a plank bed.</p>
      <p>Debtors were also held in the gaol but they could receive visitors every day instead of once every three months and were given three pints of ale a day, which they sold on to other prisoners.</p>
      <p>One of the earliest inmates was Jane Jameson, a fishwoman who lived on Sandgate; in January 1829 on Newcastle Quayside, she killed her mother in a drink-fuelled argument by stabbing her with a hot poker.</p>
      <p>Jameson was found guilty and sentenced to death, with her execution on the Town Moor witnessed by a crowd of 20,000.</p>
      <p>Measures introduced in 1752 allowed public dissection of the executed. Jameson was the last woman to be dissected in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>The last public execution in Newcastle was in 1863, after which they took place inside the gaol.</p>
      <p>The work being carried out by Dr McCorristine, part-funded by the Catherine Cookson Foundation, builds on an earlier analysis of the gaol’s inmates by Newcastle University history graduate researchers Megan Adams, Annie Padgett, and Dotty Walker.</p>
      <p>Results of the project will be shown in an exhibition next year and will also be available on a dedicated website.</p>

      <p>When the prison was demolished, a telephone exchange was built on the site. The bodies had to be removed from the yard but workmen only found 12 of the 15 burials they were expecting.</p>
      <p>The remains were driven by car to All Saints Cemetery, Jesmond, in secrecy.</p>

      <p>The Murder Act of 1752 saw the introduction of post-mortem dissection for those convicted of murder. In Newcastle, bodies were sent to the Barber Surgeons hall at Manors for a public dissection.</p>
      <p>The university research has revealed cases such as that of Charles Smith in 1817, who was sentenced to death for his role in the beating of a man in an Ouseburn pottery who later died of his injuries.</p>
      <p>After being hanged on the Town Moor, Smith’s body was taken to the Barber Surgeons. Then in 1818 it was reported that a collector had acquired some of Smith’s skin, which he had used to bind a copy of the dead man’s speech on the scaffold. This book is today held in the collection of Newcastle City Library.</p>
      <p>Dr McCorristine says: “Carliol Square has been heavily developed in the 20th century with slum clearances in the 1930s and the arrival of the central motorway in 1973.</p>
      <p>“But the area has also been a site of decay for some time, with the ghostly emptiness of the former Worswick Street bus station, for instance, or the strange cul de sacs where Carliol Square meets the motorway.”</p>

      <p>Prison reports indicate that cells were 8ft by 8ft and of the 750 prisoners entering and leaving the gaol in 1846, only four could read and write.</p>
      <p>A letter from the chaplain John Irwin in 1858 complained that the prison was a “paradise of thieves”, a “nest of villainy”, “a hot-bed of vice”, and a “house of corruption”.</p>
      <p>Project research includes the case in 1844 of Mark Sherwood, convicted of the murder of his wife Ann, who was the last person to be executed on the Town Moor.</p>
      <p>Sherwood was brought out of his cell into a mourning coach covered in black cloth and set off for the site of execution before a crowd of up to 20,000.</p>
      <p>Then there were the escapes. By the late 1850s the gaol was overcrowded and under-policed.</p>
      <p>In 1859 Joseph Preshious and Walter Scott Douglas, jewellery thieves who preyed on businesses near Pilgrim Street and the Royal Arcade, staged an escape.</p>
      <p>Douglas was captured in 1860 in a pub on the Scotswood Road by Inspector John Elliott, whose nickname was “Clencher”. Douglas was found to have two loaded pistols in his jacket, as well as a set of false whiskers and stolen jewellery.</p>
      <p>The research has uncovered an account written by an inmate in 1879 giving an insight into life on the inside. The author describes how he was led handcuffed to the gaol with other prisoners followed by a “sympathising mob”.</p>
      <p>At the prison they stripped for a brief bath and were told the rules: strict silence; no communication with other prisoners; no bartering of provisions; work hard. They were given dirty brown trousers, with a yellow and white stripe running down them.</p>
      <p>The day began at 5.45 am with breakfast on a tin pannikin slid through the door. At 6am the prisoner was given the day’s work - 4lbs of oakum to be teased out, a tedious and monotonous job.</p>
      <p>Analysis by Annie Padgett and Dotty Walker of inmate records in the 1860s and 1870s, show that the most common occupation was labourer and theft the most frequent crime, although a lot of it petty. The majority of offenders were aged between 16 and 25, with a number being children.</p>
      <p>Most prisoners were from Newcastle and Gateshead, although a significant minority were Scottish and Irish.</p>
      <p>Dr McCorristine says: “There is more work to do and a really interesting strand to develop is the imprisonment of suffragettes in 1909. “</p>
      <p>Megan Adams is currently researching suffragette activity in Newcastle and how some women sent to the gaol went on hunger strike.</p>
