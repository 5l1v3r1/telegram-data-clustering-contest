        <b>Public works tenders launched up to the end of October in Portugal increased by 71% compared to the same period in 2018, to €3.54 billion, and contracts signed rose by 16% to €2.09 billion, AICCOPN reported</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the November edition of the Public Works Barometer from the Association of Civil Construction and Public Works Industries (AICCOPN), "although high", the value of the public works tenders published in Diário da República until October "corresponds to more than double the total volume of contracts awarded under public tenders in the same period last year, which was €1.63 billion".</p>
      <p>Works contracts signed as a result of direct adjustments and prior consultations continued to fall (-7.0%) to €379 million, while contracts signed through public tenders grew 27% to €1.63 billion.</p>
