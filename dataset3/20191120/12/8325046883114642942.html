        <li>Emirates, one of Boeing’s biggest customers, said it would leave no stone unturned when it starts testing Boeing’s new 777X aircraft.</li>
        <li>Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, told reporters at the Dubai Airshow on Tuesday that he wants “one aircraft to go through hell on Earth basically to make sure it all works.”</li>
        <li>Clark said Emirates is likely to get its hands on a 777X “for a month or two” in August to test it. Deliveries of the aircraft have been delayed.</li>
        <li>Boeing remains on the back foot after two 737 Max 8 planes crashed in October 2018 and March 2019, killing a total of 346 people.</li>

      <p>Emirates, one of Boeing’s biggest customers, said it would put Boeing’s new 777X jet through “hell on Earth” before it lets passengers onboard as safety fears about Boeing aircraft persist amid the 737 Max crisis.</p>
      <p>“We need to be absolutely sure that as she comes together, as she starts flying, everything is done in a manner that it should be done,” Tim Clark, the president of Emirates, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-emirates-airshow-emirates-airlines/emirates-wants-new-boeing-jet-put-through-hell-on-earth-in-testing-idUKKBN1XT17E">told reporters at the Dubai Airshow on Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>Clark added: “I want one aircraft to go through hell on Earth basically to make sure it all works.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dubai-emirates-meets-with-faa-over-777x-certificat-462394/">Clark also said</a> Emirates is likely to get its hands on a 777X “for a month or two” in August to test it.</p>
      <p>Deliveries of the aircraft have been delayed, and it is not expected to fly commercially until 2021. During one stress test, a door on the plane blew off, <a href="https://onemileatatime.com/boeing-777x-delivery-delay/">the aviation site One Mile at a Time reported last month</a>.</p>
      <p>Clark met with Steve Dickson, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, earlier on Tuesday to discuss the 777X’s certification progress.</p>

      <p>“The FAA will take its time and do it the way it wants to do it rather than being guided by the manufacturer,” Clark said, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>Emirates has ordered more of the new Boeing aircraft than any other airline. It ordered 150 in 2013 but has reduced that to 126, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-emirates-airshow/emirates-orders-30-boeing-787-reduces-777x-order-to-126-jets-idUKKBN1XU0TI">Reuters reported on Wednesday</a>. Emirates announced a $9 billion order for 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners to make up for the reduction in 777X planes.</p>
      <p>While Boeing has new aircraft on the way, its 737 Max <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-timeline-history-full-details-2019-9?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">remains the subject of intense scrutiny and criticism</a> following two deadly crashes.</p>

      <p>A 737 Max operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed in March, killing 157 people. That followed the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max in October 2018 that killed 189 people.</p>
      <p>The aircraft <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/regulators-find-gaps-in-boeings-737-max-software-documentation-sources-2019-11">was grounded worldwide</a> in March. An update to its automated anti-stall system, the software blamed for both crashes, is being examined by the FAA ahead of a likely return to service in 2020.</p>
      <p>But many in the aviation industry remain skeptical of the 737 Max. The head of an American Airlines staff union said last week that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-american-airlines-staff-beg-avoid-plane-2019-11">some flight attendants were “begging” not to fly on the plane when it returns</a>.</p>
      <p>Recent <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-pressure-faa-737-max-staff-beg-not-to-fly-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">reports from The New York Times and Reuters</a> suggested that Boeing had pushed FAA officials to speed up testing and permit early deliveries of the repaired plane.</p>
      <p>Boeing ended a sales drought for the 737 Max since the crashes by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boeing-737-max-dubai-airshow-60-sales-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">selling 60 of the planes during the first two days</a> of the Dubai Airshow.</p>
