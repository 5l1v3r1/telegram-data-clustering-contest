      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: JuJu Smith-Schuster, Auden Tate, Phillip Dorsett affect Week 12 WR rankings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:28:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:28</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>The Week 12 WR rankings might be missing JuJu Smith-Schuster, who sustained a concussion on Thursday night. Two of our favorite sleepers, Auden Tate and Phillip Dorsett, also were hit in the head and knocked out of their respective games Sunday. That means that three players with some fantasy football relevance heading into Week 12 could be late-week decisions based on how long their recoveries take, and it could open the door for other wide receivers on their respective teams to be popular waiver pickups and sleepers.</p>

      <h3>JuJu Smith-Schuster injury update</h3>
      <p>Smith-Schuster took two shots to the helmet on the same play Thursday night and was forced from the game with a concussion. Smith-Schuster also spent time in concussion protocol during the 2017 season.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: JuJu <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1196505239215648774">also injured his knee</a> on that same play, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter, though the extent of the injury is unknown.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>The ideal situation would be that 10 days off would allow JuJu to be ready for Week 12, but concussions are also tricky business, so we probably won't know until late in the week. JuJu has been a disappointment this season. If he and Diontae Johnson (who was also concussed) both missed Week 12, James Washington would be in play against the Bengals.</p>

      <h3>Auden Tate injury news</h3>
      <p>Tate sustained a scary injury Sunday when a hit bent his neck at an awkward angle. The Bengals' wideout remained on the ground for five-plus minutes before trainers loaded him onto the medical board and carted him off. Tate did hold two thumbs up as he was carted off.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: Tate <a href="https://twitter.com/Ben_Baby/status/1196517605340860418">suffered a concussion and cervical strain</a> and is in the league's concussion protocol.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>This looked like an injury that will force Tate to miss time. One of our favorite sleepers all season, Tate can probably be safely dropped in fantasy leagues. Alex Erickson likely steps into Tate's No. 2 WR role in Cincinnati for Week 12, although John Ross (clavicle) can return from Injured Reserve in Week 13 to knock Erickson back down the pecking order. It might be time to stash Ross.</p>

      <h3>Phillip Dorsett injury status</h3>
      <p>Dorsett caught a touchdown in the third quarter Sunday, and on the same play he took a blow to the head. Dorsett didn't return to the game after that play. N'Keal Harry saw more action after Dorsett left the game and caught three-of-four targets.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Harry would fit into the same role of a boom-or-bust FLEX play as Dorsett if the veteran was forced to miss time. The New England offense still runs through Julian Edelman and the RBs for the most part, though, so Harry isn't a priority pickup.</p>
