      <h3>What exactly are the Today View and Notification Center?</h3>
      <p>The <b>Today View</b> is a unique spot that contains widgets for apps you choose. For things you use frequently like your to-do list, calendar, or weather, you can pop a widget in the Today View area. Accessing Today is done by swiping right from the left edge of the Home or Lock screen.</p>

      <p>The<b> Notification Center </b>holds, well, your notifications. Whether its new emails, app alerts, or text message notifications, you can find it all in the Notification Center. Accessing the Notification Center is done with a simple swipe downward on any screen.</p>

      <h4>Accessing Today View and Notification Center on the Lock screen</h4>
      <p>You can decide whether or not you want <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/03/25/how-to-disable-today-view-lock-screen/">access to Today View</a> and the Notification Center from your Lock screen. If you do, it takes a few taps to make it happen.</p>
      <p><b>1)</b> Open <b>Settings</b>.</p>
      <p><b>2)</b> Select <b>Touch ID &amp; Passcode</b> or <b>Face ID &amp; Passcode</b> for iPhone X and later.</p>
      <p><b>3)</b> Scroll down to the <b>Allow Access When Locked</b> section and turn on the toggles for <b>Today View</b> and/or <b>Notification Center</b>.</p>

      <h3>Customizing the Today View</h3>
      <p>Taking a bit of time to customize the Today View on your iPhone is worth it because it gives you what you use most often in an easily accessible spot.</p>
      <h4>Adding, removing, and rearranging widgets</h4>
      <p>Access <b>Today View</b>, scroll to the very bottom, and tap <b>Edit</b>. This takes you to the <b>Add Widgets</b> screen.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/iPhone-Today-View-Widgets.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>At the top, you’ll see the widgets currently in your Today View and at the bottom are the additional widgets you can add.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To <b>remove a widget</b> from Today View, tap the minus sign in red, and tap <b>Remove</b>.</li>
        <li>To <b>add a widget</b>, tap the plus sign in green.</li>
        <li>To <b>rearrange widgets</b>, tap the three-line icon, drag, and release.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you browse through widgets you can add at the bottom, you’ll notice that some apps offer more than one type of widget. For instance, the Maps app lets you pick Destinations, Nearby, or Transit widgets.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Third-party apps may provide different widgets as well. For example, Google Maps has Directions, Local Guides, Traffic, Transit Departures, and Travel Times widgets. So depending on the app, you can check out different widget options.

      </figure>
      <p>When you finish adding, removing, or rearranging your widgets, tap <b>Done</b> on the top.</p>
      <h3>Using the Notification Center</h3>
      <p>Deciding what you see in the Notification Center is a good way to make sure you’re getting the notifications you want.</p>
      <p>You might now want that area filled up with game notifications or other app alerts that you don’t care about.</p>
      <p>To adjust the notifications you see, head to your <b>Settings</b> and select <b>Notifications</b>. For each app in your list, you can decide whether or not an alert displays in the Notification Center. Tap an app and then select or deselect <b>Notification Center</b>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Settings-Notification-Center-for-app-iPhone.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It can be a tedious task to do this for every app in the list that you turn on notifications for, but worth it if you want to keep your Notification Center in order.</p>
      <h4>Actions in the Notification Center</h4>
      <p>When you swipe to access your Notification Center, you can also perform actions on those alerts.</p>
      <p>Tap or swipe right to <b>open</b> the app or swipe left to <b>manage</b> that app’s notifications, <b>view</b> a preview of the notification, or <b>clear all</b> notifications for that app.</p>
      <p>To <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2016/10/06/clear-all-notifications-notification-center-at-once/">clear out your Notification Center</a>, tap the <b>X</b> at the top.</p>
