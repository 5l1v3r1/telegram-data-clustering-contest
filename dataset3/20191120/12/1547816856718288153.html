        <b>The next guest to grace on Neha Dhupia’s show, No Filter Neha is Taapsee Pannu who talks about Sonam Kapoor’s brother Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor’s film career</b>
      </p>
      <p>Taapsee Pannu is one of the leading ladies in Bollywood. After the success of Pink, the actress is bagging some interesting and challenging roles. Though her last released film Saand Ki Aankh failed to make an impact at the box-office, it certainly did manage to impress the critics. Taapsee has always been very vocal about certain topics. When her Mission Mangal co-star Akshay Kumar’s name was on Forbes Highest Paid actors list, Taapsee too took a hilarious dig on him. Even when Kangana Ranaut’s sister talked about her acting skills, she didn’t keep quiet, in fact, she gave it back to him. Well, a similar thing happened during No Filter Neha where Taapsee spoke about certain things without filtering it out.</p>
      <p>No Filter Neha is a show where all the Bollywood stars spill all the juicy beans that definitely make headlines. This time the next guest to grace on Neha Dhupia’s show, No Filter Neha is Taapsee Pannu who talked about Sonam Kapoor’s brother Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor’s film career. </p>

      <p>In the show, the Badla actress asked that if they didn't have famous parents, to which Taapsee said that they'd be nowhere in the industry. She said, “I think Harsh Varrdhan Kapoor because whatever I have seen of him till now, I think it would have been pretty difficult to get a second film after a not so appreciated debut.”</p>

      <p>Talking about her last release, Saand Ki Aankh was screened at Jio MAMI. The film was chosen for the opening ceremony due to the incredible content of the film. On the work front, Taapsee will be next seen in Rashmi Rocket which will a biopic. The first look of Taapsee was revealed a while ago, leaving us intrigued.
