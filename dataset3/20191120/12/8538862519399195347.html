      <h1>Rumour: PS5 Release Date and Price Allegedly Leaked, But It's Just Some Guy on Twitter</h1>
      <h2>False alarm</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/Quintumply" target="_blank">Stephen Tailby</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/PSErebus/status/1196654395070582784">Twitter user</a> has stated a supposed release date and price of the PlayStation 5. This rumour is being reported by other outlets as a leak, and the date and price are being touted as fact. The truth is that this isn't fact -- it's one person's best guess.</p>
      <p>The account @PSErebus, framing itself as an "insider", is reporting on when Sony will launch PS5 in North America, and what the price tag will be. Here's what it reckons:</p>

      <p>According to this tweet, PS5 will launch on 20th November, 2020 for $499. Sounds about right, but there's absolutely no reason to believe this account holds any real information. It's pure speculation -- we'd advise you don't put any stock in this. The months before the arrival of a new console are rife with misinformation, and this tweet doesn't hold any water. That release date and price may turn out to be true, but until Sony utters the words itself next year, we wouldn't pay much attention to unsubstantiated utterings like this. Kotaku news editor Jason Schreier offers a similar warning <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumor-ps5-release-date-and-price-leaked.154207/page-2#post-26644837">over on ResetEra</a>: "These are just guesses. Anyone telling you they know the PS5â€™s price right now is lying."</p>
      <p>Still, at the very least, this whole thing invites discussion about the subject. What do you think will be the release date and price for PS5? Do you think this tweet has something, or is it a guess as good as any? Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p>
