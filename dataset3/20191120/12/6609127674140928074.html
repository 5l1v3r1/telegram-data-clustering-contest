      <p>It is understood the items were then “nicked” as the train made its way to Edinburgh Waverley since they were not handed into lost property.</p>
      <p>And now police are appealing to the public for help as they attempt to trace the treasure.</p>
      <p>Cops believe the theft would have occurred between the evening of Friday October 4 and 12.30am on Saturday October 5 when the train arrived in the Scots capital.</p>
      <p>The historic ring is believed to date from the mid to post-medieval period.</p>
      <p>And the brooch is believed to date from the late Roman era.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information that can help locate the treasure should call British Transport Police on 0800 40 50 or text them via 61016, quoting reference number 1900086888.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p>
      <p>We told on Tuesday how <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4968737/edinburgh-morrisons-supermarket-robbed-gang-cash-stolen/">an Edinburgh Morrisons store was raided</a> by thugs who stole thousands in cash.</p>
      <p>Four men broke into the retail giant’s store in the New Swanson area of the city after making their way in through a window.</p>
      <p>They then nicked a five-figure sum of cash before fleeing from the scene.</p>
