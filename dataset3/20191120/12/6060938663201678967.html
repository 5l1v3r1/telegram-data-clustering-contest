      <h1>Gautam Gulati to share screen space with Salman Khan in Radhe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:31:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">TNN</a></address>
      <p>While 'Dabangg 3' will hit the theatres soon, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a> has already announced his next project, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Radhe">Radhe</a>. On November 1, the actor shared a picture from the mahurat of the movie. Seen with his in the photo were <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Disha-Patani">Disha Patani</a>, Jackie Shroff and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Randeep-Hooda">Randeep Hooda</a>, who are a part of the cast of the film. Now, there’s another addition to the already impressive cast in the form of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Gautam-Gulati">Gautam Gulati</a>.</p>
      <p>Gautam, who made his beginning with the telly world, interacted with Salman Khan a lot when he participated in Bigg Boss. While Disha has shared screen space with Salman in 'Bharat' and Randeep Hooda has worked with him in 'Kick' and '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sultan">Sultan</a>', this will be Gautam’s first acting assignment with the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bollywood">Bollywood</a> superstar. Prabhu Dheva will be helming the film, which was earlier speculated to be a sequel of 'Wanted'. However, that rumour was dismissed by the film’s team.</p>
      <p>While not much is known about Gautam’s character, the actor apparently gave his nod as soon as he was given a brief. The film is slated to release on Eid 2020. In his forthcoming release 'Dabangg 3', Salman will be seen sharing screen space with Sonakshi Sinha and Saiee Manjrekar.</p>
