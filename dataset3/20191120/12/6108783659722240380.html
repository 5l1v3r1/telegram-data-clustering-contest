      <h1>Half-Life Alyx is a prequel, report suggests</h1>

      <h3>Looking for Half-Life 3? This isn't it.</h3>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/half-life-alyx/">Half-Life Alyx</a> </i>is a prequel and not a continuation of the franchise, a new report suggests.</p>
      <p>The report, published by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/half-life-alyx-what-we-know-about-valves-upcoming-full-length-vr-game/">Ars Technica</a>, says that <i>Alyx</i> will take place between the events of <i>Half-Life </i>and <i>Half-Life 2</i>, rather obviously placing players in the shoes of Alyx Vance, a character introduced in <i>Half-Life 2</i> and partnered with protagonist Gordon Freeman.</p>
      <p>The prequel will also leverage the physics functionality introduced in <i>Half-Life 2</i>, with “Grabbity Gloves” allegedly referenced in the game’s code base. The gloves seemed to be designed specifically for use with Valve Index VR controllers.</p>
      <p>We’ll learn more of <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/half-life-alyx/"><i>Half-Life Alyx</i></a> at The Game Awards in December. Until then, what are you hoping for with this, the next <i>Half-Life </i>game?</p>
