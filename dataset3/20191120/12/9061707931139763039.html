      <h2>Latest Derby County transfer news | The former Rams defender is a free agent after leaving the club in the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:59:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Former Derby County defender Efe Ambrose is on the lookout for a new club following the expiration of his contract at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>Reports earlier this week linked with 31-year-old centre-back with Scottish Premiership duo <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/scottish-duo-set-battle-transfer-3548620">St Johnstone and former club Hibernian</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-transfer-news/efe-ambrose-wont-make-hibs-20915507">Daily Record</a> claim that Hibs are not interested in bringing their former defender back to the club on a free transfer.</p>
      <p>The experienced centre-back signed for the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams</a> on a short-term deal in February as a free agent, shortly after his contract at Hibs has expired.</p>
      <p>Ambrose was signed as defensive cover to centre-backs Richard Keogh and Fikayo Tomori, but left <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-defender-up-there-3547692">Pride Park</a> in the summer without a single first-team appearance to his name.</p>
