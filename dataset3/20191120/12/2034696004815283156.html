      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/white-house-horror-movie-works-dont-breathe-filmmaker-1256060"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>, the <i>Evil Dead</i> director’s next film, which doesn’t yet have a release date, will also feature former <i>Fear The Walking Dead</i> writer Shintaro Shimosawa as head of production.</p>
      <p>The new information comes as Alvarez’s horror studio Bad Hombre Films has signed a deal with Legendary Pictures.</p>
      <p>Along with the new White House-themed horror, the studio will also reboot the horror classic <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i></p>

      <p><i>Doctor Sleep</i>, a new sequel to <i>The Shining</i>, came to cinemas last month. <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/doctor-sleep-review-the-shining">An <i>NME</i> review of <i>Doctor Sleep</i></a> said that the “trauma-fuelled sequel brings fresh scares to <i>The Shining</i> story.”</p>
      <p>“For the most part, <i>Doctor Sleep </i>is a thrilling, nostalgia-fuelled ride that does its best to appease fans of the original, as well as those brought up on newer King flicks like <i>Pet Sematary</i> and <i>It: Chapter Two</i>. However, you can’t help but feel this adaptation has more in common with the latter than <i>The Shining</i>. It’s much cleaner narratively and the inevitable twist is sort of predictable.”</p>
      <p>It’s already been revealed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/doctor-sleep-sequel-works-2565050">a sequel to <i>Doctor Sleep</i> is already in the works</a>.</p>
