      <h1>Leaker reveals PS5 launch date and price, as well as a key spec</h1>

      <p>The next gaming consoles are the talk of the town right now, even though they’ll be hitting stores during next year’s holiday season. The PlayStation 5 has been featured <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/19/ps5-news-ssd-storage-invention-might-be-key-to-keeping-the-price-down/">in an increasing number of leaks</a> in the past few months, while Microsoft offered fans <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/15/xbox-scarlett-specs-and-price-to-match-ps5-microsoft-says/">more details about Project Scarlett</a>. Neither company, however, is ready to announce actual availability details, and the PS5 and Xbox Scarlett designs are still a mystery. However, a leaker claims to know the actual launch details of both devices, and if it’s accurate, it’s great news.</p>
      <p>A recent report said the PS5 will start selling in early December 2020, several weeks later than anticipated, and that the console will cost around $499, which sounds like the logical price point for a console that should deliver a major performance upgrade over its predecessor. The Xbox Scarlett, meanwhile, will match the PS5 when it comes to price and power.</p>
      <p>A Twitter user who goes by the name of @PSErebus said the PS5 will launch in several countries in the holiday season of 2020, with the US launch set for November 20 — 11.20.2020 does have a ring to it. In fact, if the date is correct, we’re precisely one year away from the PS5’s North American launch.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he or she said the console will have a recommended retail price of $499.</p>

      <p>If accurate, that means the console will be in stores during next year’s Black Friday season. It’s not likely the console will get any discounts, but everything else gaming-related will be on sale, including accessories and games that you might use with the console.</p>

      <p>This is just a rumor, but <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/playstation-5-release-prijs/"><i>LetsGoDigital</i></a> says the same person revealed the release date of <i>The Last of Us 2</i> before, so they must have some inside information on hand. @PSErebus also claimed that <i>Gran Turismo 7</i> will be released for PS5 on the same date as the console.</p>

      <p>In a separate tweet, the leaker claimed the PS5 will ship with a 2TB SSD on board.</p>

      <p>The leaks don’t stop here, apparently. The person also posted launch details about the Xbox Scarlett, saying a few days ago that the console will be “the most powerful” when it launches on November 6th, 2020. If accurate, this would give Microsoft a two-week lead on the PS5.</p>
