      <p>A clever mum-of-four has transformed her conservatory into an incredible soft play room for her kids complete with a ball pit and slide.</p>
      <p>Sarah Balsdon, 29 and her husband Kyle, completed the renovations in secret - revealing the finished room to their youngest child, Elijah, on his second birthday on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The thrifty mum used foam tiles stuck down with tile adhesive on the floor and then attached strips of stripy material to the roof along with fairy lights to create a space like a circus.</p>
      <p>She used superhero wallpaper to cover the walls and bought the soft play equipment online before filling the ball pit with some second-hand balls.</p>

      <p>Sarah, a nurse and also mum to nine-year-old Shannon, eight-year-old Lucy and five-year-old Jack, said the whole project cost them less than £500.</p>
      <p>She said: "We recently moved house and will eventually be extending out the back so didn't want to spend too much.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't sure what to do with the space and that's when I came up with the soft play idea.</p>
      <p>"We have curtains leading out onto the conservatory and we kept them closed so we could surprise Elijah on his birthday.</p>

      <p>"He was so excited and his little face was a picture.</p>
      <p>"The first thing he did was dive in the ball pit and then go down the slide.</p>
      <p>"It's nice as well because the other children are still at an age where they can enjoy it.</p>
      <p>"It was actually really easy to do and has definitely earnt me some mum points."</p>

      <p>Back in October, young mum <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mum-two-spills-beans-how-20789635">Rebecca Compton spoke to us about her home renovation secrets after moving into an empty home with little money with her partner</a>.</p>
      <p>Five years later, she's now mum to two boys and runs her <a href="https://m.youtube.com/c/beccaboo">own YouTube channel</a> featuring home-makeovers on a budget.</p>
      <p>“I was in a long distance when I became pregnant,” Rebecca, 27, told Mirror Money.</p>
      <p>“That was five years ago – but since then I've fallen in love with home renovations, looking after the kids at home while making out little property our dream home,” she said.</p>
      <p>Rebecca says she’s saved hundreds and possibly thousands of pounds on home renovations in the past few years – by snapping up new carpets, a mantle piece, a Singer sewing machine and wallpaper for free.</p>
      <p>“At the time of moving in, I got a few bits from friends and family, we bought a new bed and sofa – but we had no actual flooring. On our shoe-string budget, we had to think outside of the box."</p>
      <p>But she says she's always had a creative flair - it was just a case of putting it to good use.</p>
      <p>“I come from quite a crafty family – my mum and gran have always been into DIY, so I was more than happy to decorate our home the secondhand way.”</p>
      <p>On her quest to make her dream home for free, Rebecca says she became obsessed with websites Freegle, Freecycle, Freelywheely and Facebook Marketplace.</p>
      <p>“Once you sign up to the freebie websites, they’ll start sending you alerts every morning. Go on there each day to see what’s been listed – everything is free!”</p>
      <p>“Over the past few years I’ve saved hundreds of pounds on the sites. All for free, I’ve managed to pick up a solid wood wardrobe, shredder, and even a vintage, working sewing machine to do my crafts around the house.</p>
      <p>“I’ve always said, if you wait long enough, you can get it for free – and it’s true.”</p>
      <p>But it’s not just online websites that she’s cottoned on to.</p>
      <p>“If you go into B&amp;Q or any hardware shop for that matter, you can request some sample wallpaper.</p>
      <p>“Wallpaper is also good for upcycling anything from tables, to beds and even things for the children. I covered one panel on my son’s bed with superhero wallpaper – and he absolutely loved it.</p>
      <p>"In fact, I gave both of my boys a superhero themed room in 24 hours for just £60 altogether.</p>
      <p>"I've even renovated toys - picking up a free batmobile, and turning it 'new' for my son's second birthday."</p>

      <p>Speaking on how others can get involved in free renovations, she says it’s all about having a plan and “thinking about what you can make of it”.</p>
      <p>“Make a plan, stick to local pages (less travelling means saving the planet) and use Pinterest for inspiration. There’s a great <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page called DIY On a Budget which is wonderful for inspiration.</p>
      <p>“And lastly, do it yourself. It’s such a rewarding feeling to see the result of your own hard work.”</p>
