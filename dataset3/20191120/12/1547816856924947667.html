        <b>Roshan Garry who's co-producer of the web series D-Code that's also produced by Hiten Tejwani, has been slapped with legal notice by Ullu App. Read details inside</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 11 contestant Hiten Tejwani is facing a tough time due his co-producer Roshan Garry. Hiten co-produced one episode of the 6-episode web series for ULLU App titled D-Code in which he even acted.The first episode of the series is already streaming on the App. But, the remaining five episodes haven’t been released yet due to a financial dispute.<br/><br/>A source told SpotboyE.com that Roshan Garry had a showdown with the App and decided to not release the remaining episodes on the OTT platform. Reason? Well, the Ullu App team had approached the Western India Film Producers Association (WIFPA) And Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association (IIMPA) after they received<br/>complaints from some technicians for non-payment of dues by Roshan.</p>

      <p>When we contacted Vibhu Agarwal, CEO of Ullu App,"Yes, we have sent her a legal notice. We have hired her to produce web series for us. And as per the agreement, we had done 30% payment before shooting. And she had given us the final product of six episodes. But while QC (quality check) we felt that dubbing was needed. However, as per the plan, we released the first episode with all the credits on our platform and requested her to go for dubbing for the remaining five. Unfortunately, when the episode was streamed on Ullu many technicians and artistes contacted us via social media to complain about their non-payment of dues.”</p>

      <p>He added, “Meanwhile, we got to know that Hiten Tejwani who is such a known name in the industry has also been not paid. Many warned us to release their payments or they will go the legal way. However, we had no role to play as the payment was already done to Roshan as per the agreement. Also, during the shoot, we received complaints of misconduct on the sets by her, but we thought it may be a minor issue and with time would be resolved. But now as we met her, we told her to produce an NOC from the people who have worked with her on the show and also to submit dubbing before we releases her pending money but she didn't agree. Also, last Saturday she barged into our office, created a lot of ruckus and took away her hard drives of the pending episodes. She complained to the Federation, but when we spoke to them they also understood the loopholes and were ready to support us".</p>

      <p>We contacted Roshan to know her side of the story but she requested us to take statement from her lawyer Suvigya Vidyarthi on her behalf and here’s what he told us, "It is the case of my client that the Ullu app and its employees have breached the agreement entered into by them and my client. My client is being criminally harassed by the channel and is being made to run from pillar to post on the issue of obtaining NOCs from the crew and cast, which is not only an after-thought of the channel but also a gross breach of trust as the same does not find place in the list of deliverable documents in the agreement signed by both the parties. It is not far to see that the channel is trying to subjugate my client into meek submission by resorting to illegal misplaced bravado and a patently false propaganda which will not be tolerated. As is the word in the industry, the said channel is habitual of such instances and takes sadistic pride in perpetrating the same malfeasance to the hapless producers. We will be giving a befitting detailed reply to their notice and will activate the justice dispensation machinery of our country soon".<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:-Radioandmusic/PR</i></p>
