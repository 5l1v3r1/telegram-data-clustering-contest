      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-sequel-works-todd-phillips-talks/">Reports of a sequel</a> to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-film/">Joker</a> being in production may have been premature.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/joker-sequel-no-discussions-yet-todd-phillips-no-dc-origin-villian-films-planned-1202790774/">Deadline</a>, there are no set deals for a sequel to <i>Joker </i>at this time, though the movie's monumental success at the box office does increase the chances one will enter production sooner rather than later. However, at this time, director Todd Phillips and writer Scott Silver are not in negotiations for any such project. The article also disputes claims Phillips met with Warner Bros.' Toby Emmerich about pursuing more <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-todd-phillips-more-dc-origin-films/">DC character origin story films</a>.</p>

      <p>Since releasing earlier this year, <i>Joker </i>has becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time as well as the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-movie-1-billion-box-office/">first movie with that rating</a> to gross $1 billion at the worldwide box office. The film only had a budget of around $60 million, making <i>Joker </i>immensely profitable for Warner Bros. Although the movie garnered controversy, <i>Joker </i>is generally considered to be a contender for this year's Academy Awards following its win of the coveted Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.</p>
      <p>Directed by Todd Phillips, <a href="https://screenrant.com/joaquin-phoenix-jokers-ending/">Joker</a> stars Joaquin Phoenix, Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Bill Camp, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Glenn Fleshler, Douglas Hodge, Marc Maron, Josh Pais and Shea Whigham. The film is now in theaters.</p>
