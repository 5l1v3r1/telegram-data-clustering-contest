      <h1>Why Does Wasabi Heat Feel Different To Chilli Heat?</h1>

      <p>I love hot peppers, but I can’t stand wasabi. Both might be described as “hot” or “spicy,” but they create that feeling in different ways. Here’s how.</p>
      <p>You may have heard of <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/capsaicin">capsaicin</a>, the oily chemical in jalapeños, hot sauce, chilli powder, and other hot-pepper-derived foods and condiments.</p>
      <p>Wasabi, mustard and horseradish contain a different chemical, <a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/allyl_isothiocyanate">allyl isothiocyanate</a>. (This is no relation to the chemical in <a href="http://www.bris.ac.uk/Depts/Chemistry/MOTM/mustard/mustard.htm">mustard gas</a>, which is unrelated but got its name because early preparations reportedly smelled like mustard.)</p>
      <p>Both chemicals hurt us in a similar way: they bind to receptors in our mouth or nose that exist to warn our brains of painful stimuli. Your tongue isn’t <i>actually</i> being damaged, but your brain is getting a signal as if it were.</p>
      <p>The two chemicals primarily target different receptors: capsaicin is best known for stimulating TRPV1, which also reacts to heat, and allyl isothiocyanate binds to TRPA1, which also reacts to a variety of chemical irritants. So they are tricking your brain in slightly different ways.</p>
      <p>There’s another way the two chemicals feel different: capsaicin is an oily molecule that sits on your tongue, so the chilli pepper residue may linger until you have some <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/04/the-foods-that-cool-your-mouth-after-eating-something-spicy">fat-containing foods like yogurt or milk</a> to wash it away.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, allyl isothiocyanate is more volatile, meaning it’s likely to waft up your nose. The upside of that: After irritating your receptors, it can float away, meaning the pain from wasabi is short-lived.</p>
