      <h1>Amazon may open checkout-free supermarkets early next year</h1>
      <h2>The retailer will bring its Amazon Go tech to larger stores.</h2>

      <p>There have been plenty of rumors about Amazon's plans to shake up the grocery industry with cashierless stores. The latest is that Amazon plans to launch checkout-free supermarkets in the first quarter of 2020. The company may also license its Amazon Go cashierless tech to other retailers, a person close to the project <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/amazon-go-cashierless-supermarkets-pop-up-stores-coming-soon">told <i>Bloomberg</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon opened its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/01/21/amazon-go-opens-to-public-january-22/">first checkout-free store</a> in early 2018, and it has said it could open <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/19/amazon-3-000-cashierless-go-stores-2021/">as many as 3,000</a> cashierless Amazon Go stores by 2021. So far, most have been smaller convenience stores, but people have speculated that it's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/27/amazon-go-inevitable-evolution-of-supermarkets/">only a matter of time</a> before Amazon brings the cashierless checkout to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/02/amazon-tests-checkout-free-shopping-for-larger-stores/">large supermarkets</a>. That said, it's unclear how exactly Amazon will make that model work with the many items in a grocery store that need to be weighed before purchase, like fresh fruit and vegetables. But last month, Amazon confirmed that its engineers are <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/amazon-confirms-amazon-go-team-running-internal-tests-secretive-retail-store-seattle/">testing Go tech</a> at a 10,400-square-foot retail space in Seattle.</p>
      <p>Amazon is notorious for trying multiple ideas at once, and just last week, the company said it plans to roll out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/11/amazon-grocery-store-los-angeles/">another grocery store format</a>. Supposedly, that model will be different from Whole Foods but will still have cashiers. Amazon is also considering licensing its cashierless tech to other retailers, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/30/amazon-go-sports-movies/">movie theaters, stadiums</a> and airports.</p>
      <p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
