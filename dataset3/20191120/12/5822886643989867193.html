      <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 whole 3-pound (1.4-kg) chicken, skin on </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground coriander </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon olive oil </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>½ cup (70 g) quartered black olives </li>
        <li>½ cup (70 g) quartered kalamata olives </li>
        <li>½ cup (70 g) quartered green olives </li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, chopped </li>
        <li>4 large button mushrooms, diced </li>
        <li>¼ cup (35 g) pine nuts </li>
        <li>¼ lemon, cut in wedges</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Method:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C or gas mark 4).</li>
        <li>Remove giblets and neck from chicken; discard or save for another use. Pat chicken dry using paper towels. Slide fingers under the chicken skin at the openings to loosen skin and create deep pockets for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Combine coriander, cumin, olive oil, salt, and half of the garlic. Spread paste over the chicken meat underneath the skin. Season outside of skin with any remaining spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining garlic with olives, celery, mushrooms, and pine nuts. Stuff the mixture inside the cavity of the chicken along with lemon wedges. Optional: Truss the chicken with cooking twine, securing the legs and wings close to the body for a more even cook.</li>
        <li>Place chicken on a roasting pan, breast-side up.</li>
        <li>Bake for 1 hour, 10 minutes, or until internal temperature of chicken and stuffing has reached a minimum of 180°F (82°C). Baste chicken every 20 minutes with the drippings.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 20 to 30 minutes prior to serving.</li>
        <li>Remove stuffing from the cavity and serve alongside carved chicken.</li>
      </ol>
