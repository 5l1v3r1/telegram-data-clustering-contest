      <p>His letter reads:</p>
      <p>“You’ll soon be fathers and husbands. Brothers and friends. Mentors and teachers. You’re going to lead by example. You’re going to be courageous and strong. Brave and resilient.</p>
      <p>And you will also face fear, doubts and experience great tribulations. Undoubtedly, there will be times when you fail, and you will feel like crying and letting it all out.</p>
      <p>But sure enough, you’ll hold back the tears and pretend to be tough. Because that’s what men do.</p>
      <p>Because that’s what we are brought up to believe — that men are not supposed to cry. That crying makes a man weak.</p>
      <p>I grew up believing this. And the reason I’m writing to you today, is because I realized that I was wrong. My struggles and my pain made me who I am, shaping me into a better man.</p>
      <p>16/11/2013. I still remember that day on the field. I had thought about it for a long time but nothing could prepare me for that last walk back to the pavilion.</p>
      <p>With each step it started sinking in. I felt a lump in my throat, the fear of it all ending. There was so much going through my head in that moment. I just couldn’t keep it in. And I didn’t fight it.</p>
      <p>I let go in front of the world, and surprisingly, I felt a certain peace. I felt stronger for putting myself out there and grateful for everything that I had received. I realized I was man enough.</p>
      <p>There’s no shame in showing your tears. So why hide a part of you that actually makes you stronger? Why hide your tears?</p>
      <p>It takes a lot of courage to show your pain and your vulnerability. But just as sure as the morning, you’ll emerge from it tougher and better. So I encourage you to move past these stereotypes and notions of what men can or cannot do. Whoever you are, wherever you are, I wish you this courage.”</p>
