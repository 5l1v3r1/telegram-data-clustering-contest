      <p>Volkswagen has given a glimpse of the electric future of the estate car with its latest concept.</p>
      <p>This is the ID. Space Vizzion — the seventh entry in the firm’s range of all-electric ID. concept cars.</p>
      <p>It takes on familiar styling cues from other ID. models, including its thin headlights, wide honeycomb grille incorporating its LED daytime running lights and a large single-bar light stretching across the rear of the car.</p>

      <p>Underneath the bodywork sits an 82kWh battery, said to deliver up to 367 miles between charges. With a system output of 335bhp, 0-60mph is said to be covered in five seconds flat.</p>
      <p>Inside the car, a new material made dubbed AppleSkin — which is an artificial leather containing residual matter from apple juice production — is utilised throughout the cabin. No chrome materials are used in the interior either, with chrome-painted surfaces in their places.</p>

      <p>A ‘fully digitised’ cockpit is in place too, with an Augmented Reality head-up display providing key driver information on the windscreen, while a mini display in place of traditional dials and gauges is present. A 15.6-inch infotainment display features as well.</p>
      <p>Volkswagen says the ID. Space Vizzion will inspire an all-electric production estate which will hit the market in 2021.</p>
