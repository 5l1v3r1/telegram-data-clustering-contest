      <h2>Could the Lib Dems stage a comeback in this strongly pro-Remain seat?</h2>
      <address>

      <p>MPs from the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties have all represented Cambridge over the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>But recently the seat has become purely a two-horse race between Labour and the Lib Dems.</p>
      <p>Changing demographics within the city, together with an expanding student population, have pushed Cambridge leftwards across the political spectrum.</p>
      <p>Since 1992, the constituency has alternated between Labour and Lib Dem MPs and was won by Labour at both the 2015 and 2017 elections.</p>
      <p>Daniel Zeichner is defending the seat for Labour and does so from a position of strength, having increased his majority from 599 in 2015 to 12,661 in 2017.</p>

      <p>A hefty swing of 11.4% is needed for the Liberal Democrats to take back the seat they held between 2005 and 2015.</p>
      <p>But the party believes it has a chance – and Brexit could be the key to victory.</p>
      <p>The area covered by the local authority of Cambridge – not quite the same as the parliamentary constituency – voted 73.8% Remain in the 2016 EU referendum.</p>
      <p>This was the 10th highest Remain vote in the UK.</p>
      <p>If the Lib Dems’ anti-Brexit message attracts a lot of Labour voters disillusioned with Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit policy, plus some Remain-backing Conservatives, Cambridge might be within the party’s grasp.</p>
      <p>Party leader Jo Swinson visited the seat on Wednesday as part of the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto launch.</p>
      <p>A total of eight candidates are standing in Cambridge in this election: Labour, Lib Dems, Conservative, Green, Brexit Party, SDP, Rebooting Democracy and an independent.</p>
