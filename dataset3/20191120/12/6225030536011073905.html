      <p>Trainer Mike Maker ran two horses in the Breeders’ Cup at Santa Anita Park with <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Chimney_Rock_1">Chimney Rock</a></b> a close second to Four Wheel Drive in the Juvenile Turf Sprint and Zulu Alpha checking in fourth in the Breeders' Cup Turf.</p>
      <p>According to the publicity department at Kentucky Downs, where Maker is the all-time winningest trainer, Zulu Alpha has been sent to Upson Downs Farm outside Louisville for a winter break, but Chimney Rock could race again this year on Louisiana Champions Day at Fair Grounds on Dec. 14.</p>
      <p>While no race was specified, it infers Chimney Rock will try the dirt as the only event scheduled for 2-year-old males is the $100,000 Juvenile Stakes at six furlongs on the main track. The Louisiana-bred son of Artie Schiller has made five straight turf starts since debuting in a dirt sprint at Belmont Park and running third on June 21.</p>
      <p>Three Diamonds Farm’s Chimney Rock has finished runner-up in three straight stakes races behind a horse trained Wesley Ward. He was beaten a head by Cambria from the Ward barn in the Kentucky Downs Juvenile Turf Sprint and then was second by a half-length to Ward's Kimari in the Indian Summer at Keeneland before being beaten three-quarter of a length by Four Wheel Drive in the Breeders' Cup.</p>
      <p>Chimney Rock did manage to beat the fillies Kimari and Cambria in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Turf Sprint.</p>

      <p>For Maker, it was something of an extension of his Kentucky Downs meet, when his streak of four straight training titles at America’s most unique race meet ended after he had 14 seconds to go with three wins. That was one fewer than the four victories that gave Joe Sharp, Wesley Ward and Ian Wilkes a tie for the meet crown.</p>
      <p>“I was working on the record for seconds,” quipped Maker, who ran 48 horses at the meet and came away with the ever-important earnings title at more than $1.4 million, almost double that of second-place Rusty Arnold.</p>
      <p>Chimney Rock was bought for $18,000 at the Equine Sales of Louisiana Yearling Sale. He has a record of 1-3-1 from six starts and earnings of $309,025.</p>
      <p>Much of turf racing is getting the trip. Michael Hui’s Zulu Alpha didn’t get it in the Breeders’ Cup Turf, having to come from last and wide in rallying to be fourth, only 1 3/4 lengths behind victorious even-money favorite Bricks and Mortar.</p>
      <p>Zulu Alpha, winner of Kentucky Downs’ first $1 million race in taking the Calumet Farm Kentucky Turf Cup over 2018 victor Arklow, was last of 12 horses until rounding for home in the Breeders’ Cup. He still had only one horse beaten with less than an eighth-mile to go in the 1 1/2-mile stakes.</p>
      <p>“He was farther back than I would have liked to have seen,” Maker said. “He lost a lot of ground but ran a very creditable race."</p>
      <p>“So very proud of our guy Zulu,” Hui said this week. “He overcame a less than perfect trip to secure fourth in a huge race, only beaten less than two lengths. That was a very tough group of horses.</p>
      <p>“Zulu came out of the Breeders’ Cup Turf just fine. He’s enjoying some pasture time at Upson Downs Farm (outside of Louisville) and will resume training with Mike at Gulfstream Park. We’re hoping for great things in 2020.”</p>
