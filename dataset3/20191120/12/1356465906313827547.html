      <h1>Israeli scale-up Vayyar Imaging lands $109 million Series D for its radar imaging technology</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tech.eu/author/annelise-musgrove/" target="_blank">Annie Musgrove</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://vayyar.com/">Vayyar Imaging</a>, the Israeli-born global leader in 4D radar imaging sensor technology, has raised $109 million in Series D financing, yet another example of <a href="https://tech.eu/research/28917/blooming-late-stage-funding-europe-european-tech-report/">late-stage funding for European scale-ups</a>. The round was led by Koch Disruptive Technologies (Koch), with Regal Four and all existing investors including Battery Ventures, Bessemer Ventures, ICV, ITI, WRVI Capital, and ClalTech.<br/><br/>Vayyar is developing the next generation of sensing technology that is miniature (“millimeter wave”), affordable, and versatile enough to impact everyone’s lives. “Welcome to a world where intelligent sensing is part of the everyday,” the company says. And that’s not far off. In 2018, Vayyar Imaging was named a Technology Pioneer with the potential to transform society and industry by the World Economic Forum. <br/><br/>The company’s 4D radar imaging sensors can see through walls and objects; they can track and map everything happening in an environment in real-time. Unlike other products that rely on cameras and optics, Vayyar’s sensors do not collect any optic data, protecting users’ privacy at all times.<br/><br/>Vayyar provides these sensors to a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, smart home, robotics, retail and medical. The technology could drive an autonomous car, spot a leak in the plumbing, or detect breast cancer.<br/><br/>Such highly advanced technology with seemingly limitless application is likely why this Series D round has more than doubled Vayyar’s total capital raised, now $188 million to date. <br/><br/>“Advancements in imaging sensors are vital as technology continues to disrupt all aspects of society,” said Chase Koch, president of Koch Disruptive Technologies. “We see incredible potential in combining Vayyar’s innovative technology and principled leadership team with Koch’s global reach and capabilities to create breakthroughs in a wide range of industries.”<br/><br/>Co-founder, CEO, and Chairman of Vayyar Raviv Melamed said: “We are excited to partner with Koch and Regal Four as we drive our business forward. Koch’s entrepreneurial culture and market leadership in multiple industries can help accelerate Vayyar’s growth much faster than we did before. With this new funding round, we will continue to create the next generation of sensing technology that is miniature, affordable and versatile enough to impact everyone’s lives.</p>
