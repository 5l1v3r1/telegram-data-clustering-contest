      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:55:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:55</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Systems integrator Dimension Data (DiData) has partnered with “flexible” workspace provider, the <a href="https://www.iwgplc.com/">International Workplace Group</a> (IWG).</p>
      <p>In a statement, DiData describes the partnership as one of its “most strategic cloud transformation and managed services deals”.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, IWG decided to partner with DiData and its digital business solutions arm, Britehouse, because of its Microsoft Azure skills and managed services capabilities.</p>
      <p>Another key driver for IWG to move to Azure is risk reduction, meaning DiData could implement cost-effective disaster recovery in cloud and increase application availability, it adds.</p>
      <p>In terms of the deal, IWG will enhance its global technology platform to create greater agility, application availability and resilience for critical applications and on Microsoft Azure.</p>
      <p>IWG CIO Andre Sharpe says: “With our growing number of large corporate customers and new franchise partners, this was the right time to invest in improving our services even further.</p>
