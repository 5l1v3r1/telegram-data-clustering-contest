      <h2>Revised norms categorise apartments above four-storey as high-rise building; stipulate more space for houses</h2>

      <p>The Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) Calicut chapter and several trade and industry organisations have opposed the newly brought out Kerala Municipality and Panchayat Building rules saying that the provisions would have a detrimental impact on the development of several sectors.</p>
      <p>At a news conference here on Tuesday, CREDAI office bearers M.A. Mehaboob and K. Arunkumar urged the government to desist from the move to implement the newly-framed rules. Before drafting the rules, the government ought to have held consultations with the representatives of the construction industry and other related sectors, they said.</p>
      <p>They said that construction segment had not come out of the difficulties following the demonetisation, implementation of the Goods and Service Tax and the floods that hit the State. If the new rules were implemented, hundreds of establishments would be closed down. Besides, about 8,000 engineers and 18 lakh workers would be rendered jobless. This would also have a severe bearing on the economy of the State. They said the new rule stipulated that more space is required for the construction of a house. But this was impossible in a State that had the highest density of population in the country. Home aspirants would also have to shoulder additional burden by paying more for land.</p>
      <p>The cost of construction would also increase manifold if the rules were executed in toto. Any apartment or complex above four-storey would be categorsied as high-rise building, they said.</p>
      <p>The Malabar Chamber of Commerce, Kerala State Small Scale Industries Association, LENSFED, Buildersâ€™ Association of India, Indian Institute of Architects, Calicut Chamber of Industry, The Institute of Engineersalso supported the demand of CREDAI to withdraw the rules.</p>
