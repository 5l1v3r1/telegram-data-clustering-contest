      <p>The Stadia reviews are in, and they're not good. But you know what the worst part of the experience might be? Trying to play <i>Just Dance 2020</i>.</p>
      <p>Part of the Stadia promise is the ability to stream games to your phone that wouldn't ordinarily belong there: <i>Destiny</i>, <i>Rise of the Tomb Raider</i>, and so on. <i>Just Dance 2020</i> is another one of those titles, but what's <i>astonishing</i> is the whole setup process.</p>
      <p>Because <i>Just Dance 2020</i> needs to track your motion somehow, the game — regardless of what platform you're playing on — uses your smartphone to track your movement. But what if you want to play <i>Just Dance</i> on Google Stadia through your phone?</p>
      <p>As Giant Bomb hilariously noted below, you'll need <i>two</i> phones: one to play the game, and another to <i>track your scoring</i>. You then have to go through a whole setup and pairing process, which kind of kills one of Stadia's biggest advantages — just jump in and play with no loading times etc. — before going through a little tutorial on how to navigate through the game using your phone.</p>

      <p>The more I hear about Stadia, the less I want it. Hopefully by the time it actually comes to Australia, Stadia won't just have a library but a reason for using the service that makes sense for people who play games in 2019, not 2029.</p>
