      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Kelly</a></address>
      <p>The Books on Tyne festival in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> returns this month with a full programme of events, talks and activities.</p>
      <p>It is the ninth time the festival – the result of a collaboration between the Lit &amp; Phil and Newcastle Libraries – has been held in the city.</p>
      <p>Running for a week from this Saturday it is being staged across two venues - the Lit &amp;  Phil on Westgate Road and Newcastle City Library on New Bridge Street.</p>
      <p>The festival offers events for every taste and interest – from crime fiction to poetry and local history, the graphic novel to the contemporary ghost story, wartime writing to children’s fairy tales, rock ‘n roll biography to classic literature.</p>
      <p>Highlights this year include a dramatic celebration of the 300th anniversary of Robinson Crusoe, as well as audiences with award-winning music documentary maker Bob Smeaton, popular broadcaster John Grundy, the UK’s foremost forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd and record-breaking Paralympian and ex-Marine Andy Grant.</p>
      <p>Critically-acclaimed crime writer Paula Daly, popular science author Steve Jones and 2019 Hawthornden Prize winner Sue Prideaux will all be discussing their current and forthcoming books, as will some of our region’s most influential authors Dr Deborah Smith (The James Losh Diaries), Yvonne Young (Cobbled Streets and Penny Sweets) and Pip Harrison (Look at me now!).</p>
      <p>On November 30, former Newcastle United footballer Paul Ferris will discuss his bestselling autobiography The Boy on the Shed and on the same day budding young story makers can take part in a creative workshop with local author and illustrator Julia Stafford, followed by an enchanting storytelling session with Chris Bostock and his Hearthside Tales team.</p>
      <p>Lit &amp; Phil librarian and programme director Kay Easson said: “We are excited to launch our ninth festival, and the wealth of events this year is testament to its growing popularity.</p>
      <p>“We have continued to build on our partnership with Newcastle Libraries and together offer a broad range to suit all tastes an ages across two venues – one contemporary, one historic. Newcastle and the North East have a long literary tradition and there can be no better way to celebrate this than with Books on the Tyne.”</p>
      <p>Newcastle Libraries programme director Derek Tree added: “For one week only, the great and good of the literary world will descend upon Newcastle to celebrate the written word in all its forms and genres, offering something for everyone.”</p>
      <p>There will also be free guided tours of the historic Lit &amp; Phil on Westgate Road throughout the day on both November 23 and November 30 - booking is essential.</p>
      <p>A hidden gem in the heart of the city, The Lit &amp;Phil houses more than 170,000 books. The library is free to explore and open to all - although only members may borrow books.</p>
      <p>Books on Tyne runs from November 23 to 30. Many events are free or from as little as £3, but booking for all is essential.</p>
