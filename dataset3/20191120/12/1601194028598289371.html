      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/corey-graves">Corey Graves</a> has been very outspoken in the past about how <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> essentially decided to end their friendship after he walked out on WWE in January 2014.</p>
      <p>Punk recently returned to WWE programming for the first time in almost six years as an analyst on weekly FS1 show WWE Backstage, which prompted lots of fans to ask Graves for his opinion on the former WWE Champion’s new role.</p>
      <p>Speaking on his <a href="https://www.endeavoraudio.com/podcasts/wwe-podcasts/after-the-bell">After The Bell</a> podcast, the SmackDown commentator chose not to go into detail on his past issues with Punk. Instead, he simply stated that FOX has made a “great move” by recruiting one of wrestling’s most controversial personalities.</p>
      <blockquote>“This, of course, has fuelled rumours and speculation aplenty: Is Punk coming back into the WWE fold? Is he going to compete again? Punk himself has said ‘no’, he’s not interested in wrestling any more. But, as his appearance alone proved, you can never say never in WWE. I’ve been getting a litany of tweets and Instagram messages asking my person opinion on the matter. My personal opinion on the matter is that it is a great move by FOX.”</blockquote>

      <h4>Why are CM Punk and Corey Graves no longer friends?</h4>
      <p>Following CM Punk’s loss against Mike Jackson at UFC 225 in June 2018, Corey Graves posted a series of tweets about the WWE Superstar-turned-MMA fighter.</p>
      <p>He criticised Punk for “abandoning everybody who stood by his side” and claimed that his former friend, who held his first son before he did, betrayed his loyalty.</p>
