      <p>Hirst, who also worked as a writer on The Tudors, expressed his happiness to be returning to "glorious" Wicklow.</p>
      <p>He said: "I am so happy that we are returning to Ireland and Ashford Studios in glorious County Wicklow, which has been our home for the last eight years."</p>
      <p>"Our Irish crew, in my opinion, is the best and most professional crew in the world. And it has been a particular joy to me, shared with my producer Morgan O’Sullivan, that we have been able to give continuous employment to many hundreds of Irish men and women."</p>
      <p>Hirst also hailed Ireland for "its support of writers and drama" and said the show will benefit both from "cultural and financial support."</p>
      <p>He added: "Making a great show isn’t a mechanical activity; it’s a human one!”</p>
