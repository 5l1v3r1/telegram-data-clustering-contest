      <p><b>Bengaluru:</b> After day-long scrutiny of 355 candidatures received until November 18, for the Karnataka bypolls slated for December 5, the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) rejected 54 nominations filed by 30 candidates.</p>
      <p>According to a poll official, 301 nominations have been accepted, news agency <i>IANS </i>reported.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Of the 248 candidates, 218 nominations, including 125 Independents, were found valid.</p>
      <p>The candidates include 15 each of the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Congress and 14 of the Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S), which will not be contesting the Hoskote seat in Bengaluru rural district.</p>
      <p>Other contestants include one Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for Vijayanagara seat and two Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) for Cikkaballapura and Hunsur seats.</p>
      <p>The last date of withdrawal is November 21. The counting of votes will take place on December 9.</p>
      <p>The bypolls were to commence from October 21 but they were postponed to December 5 as the Supreme Court was yet to deliver a verdict on the 17 disqualified MLAs.</p>
      <p>The MLAs were disqualified by the former speaker KR Ramesh Kumar in July. However, the SC passed a verdict that these MLAs can contest the bypolls.</p>
      <p>Out of 17 MLAs, 15 were sworn into the BJP.</p>
      <p>Bypolls to Muski (Raichur district) and RR Nagar (Bengaluru southwest) have been delayed due to litigation in the Karnataka High Court over their results in the May 2018 Assembly polls.</p>
      <p>The remaining 15 constituencies from which bypolls will be held are Athani, Kagwad, Gokak, Yellapura, Hirekerur, Ranibennur, Vijaynagara, Chickballapura, K.R. Pura, Yeshwanthpura, Mahalakshmi Layout, Shivajinagar, Hosakote, K.R. Pete and Hunsur.</p>
