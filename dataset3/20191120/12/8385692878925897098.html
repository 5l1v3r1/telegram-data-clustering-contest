      <p>Today you can save up to 35-percent on select wireless chargers and accessories through Amazon's Gold Box Deal of the Day. That means that these are good today only and will expire at midnight PST. These include wireless chargers from Belkin and iOttie. You'll be able to save big on wireless charging car docks as well. Allowing you to charge your phone while you're using your phone for navigation or streaming music.</p>
      <p>Best Buy's Doorbuster today is for a four-pack of Arlo Pro 2 security cameras. Allowing you to save a cool $250 off of the regular price. This makes it a really great time to pick up a few and put around your house to make sure that you are safe and sound. These security cameras are indoor and outdoor ready. They are wire-free, with batteries that will last up to six months (depending on your recording settings) and are weatherproof. So they can be used to watch your front porch for package pirates. Which is important during this time of the year, when we are all getting a ton of Amazon packages.</p>
      <p>It's time to step up your audio game, with a new sound bar. And Amazon has the Sony HT-S350 Soundbar with wireless subwoofer on sale for just $198 right now. This is down from its regular price of $278. It also has some really good audio quality, thanks to that wireless sub that is going to give you some deep bass. And that sound bar that just sounds amazing. We all know that Sony knows audio.</p>
