      <p>Owen Olsen will be back in Oklahoma to continue his college football career.</p>
      <p>The former Yukon linebacker announced Tuesday on Twitter he committed to Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M College.</p>
      <p>Olsen, a freshman, said last week he was leaving the Naval Academy.</p>
      <p>Olsen was reclassified into the 2020 recruiting class. He can play four years and is eligible for a redshirt season.</p>
      <p>Olsen was a second-team selection on <i>The Oklahoman’s</i> 2018 Big All-City squad. He recorded 67 total tackles and played wide receiver.</p>
      <p>Olsen’s brother, Perry, is a quarterback at Navy. He replaced starter Malcolm Perry in the third quarter of last week’s 52-20 loss at Notre Dame. The freshman threw a touchdown pass and rushed for a score.</p>
