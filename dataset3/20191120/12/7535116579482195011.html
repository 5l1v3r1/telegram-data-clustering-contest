      <p>About a year ago (2018), <a href="https://www.worldofbuzz.com/japanese-and-senegal-fans-earn-netizens-respect-for-cleaning-up-after-football-matches/">Japanese and Senegal fans went viral for picking trash and cleaning up the stadium</a> after a match at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Ever since then many people all over the world, including Malaysians, have adopted this good attitude of trying to clean up stadiums after a match.</p>

      <p>Therefore, Malaysians took it upon themselves to clean up the Bukit Jalil stadium by picking up rubbish that wasn’t disposed of properly after Harimau Malaya won the match against the Indonesian football team last night (19th November 2019). Joining the initiative was Syed Saddiq, who is our beloved Youth and Sports Minister.</p>

      <p>Photos of Malaysians cleaning the stadium alongside Syed Saddiq were shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DbvhOlson/">his Instagram page</a> and the post was accompanied by a caption which read,</p>
      <blockquote>“OUR STADIUM, OUR HOUSE. Our cleanliness mirrors our culture.”</blockquote>
