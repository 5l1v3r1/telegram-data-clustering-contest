      <hr/>
      <p>The accepted wisdom when it comes to shopping for TVs over the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping period is that you should wait until the official start date before investing.</p>
      <p>This is generally good advice, but does carry some risks. You might miss out on some of the best deals by waiting, and you could miss out completely if stocks run out. That's why it's always a good idea to keep on top of all the deals in the weeks preceding Black Friday.</p>
      <p>We have been keeping close tabs on Amazon's "Countdown to Black Friday Sale," and there has already been loads of deals on pretty much everything. The one item that has not featured heavily yet is the TV, until now.</p>
      <p>You can now <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/be4m">save up to 40%</a> on a wide range of TVs from top brands like Hisense, Philips, Toshiba, and more. We have checked these out to give you a solid idea of what is on offer.</p>
