      <p>On the event, Wimmer says: “Metallica isn’t just another headliner. When Metallica takes the stage, it’s an event. It’s an experience. That’s the same standard we’ve set for every DWP festival – from the first band to the last band, and everything that happens in between. </p>
      <p>"I can’t wait to bring the biggest band in the world to the biggest rock festivals in America. Metallica paved this road that we travel. How many artists on the bill at these five festivals first picked up an instrument, or first started a band, because of Metallica?"</p>
      <p>Tickets are available now from Epicenter's official website, with general admission weekend tickets starting at $189.50.</p>
