      <h1>The Astros' sign stealing scandal was oddly predicted by a Reddit user</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:17:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this month, The Athletic <a href="https://theathletic.com/1363451/2019/11/12/the-astros-stole-signs-electronically-in-2017-part-of-a-much-broader-issue-for-major-league-baseball/">released a detailed report</a> on how the Astros were electronically stealing signs during their 2017 season. And back in October, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/dm7jov/game_thread_world_series_game_2_nationals_1/f4yk70c?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">a Reddit user predicted</a> that such an article would be published.</p>
      <p>Reddit user "meme-engineer" posted a comment on the /r/baseball World Series Game 2 thread about a dream they had. This dream predicted, with an odd accuracy, what was about to unfold in November.</p>
      <p>Here's the comment:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>I had a dream a couple weeks back when the astros were playing the rays, it was that after the post season finished a news story came out that the astros had a team of people deciphering signs with cameras and then that team relayed the signal to transponders that were worn in the cleats of the top (trusted not to snitch) astros players, the transponders would vibrate according to what pitch was coming (example: once for fastball, twice for off speed)<br/></i>
        <i>But it was just a dream haha. That wouldn't happen.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>It's worth noting the comment <i>was</i> edited, but Reddit's website says it was edited 26 days ago.</p>
      <p>The comment didn't receive much attention at the time, but users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/dyhf5s/to_think_we_had_a_whistleblower_on_reddit_try_and/">gave it attention</a> on Nov. 19. Four days before his comment gained more attention, the Reddit user posted a comment in a thread about the Astros' sign stealing scandal.</p>
      <p>Here's the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/dw1u4g/astros_sign_stealing_video_footage_megathread_for/f7i9dui/?context=3">comment</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>In important home games, the top astros players steal signs electronically by having someone working with them from far away decipher the sign from the camera feed, then that person will relay a signal to a device that the batters wear in their cleats that vibrate in a pattern according to what pitch it is (example: vibrate once for fastball, twice for off-speed)</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This information was not made available in The Athletic's report, but it was mentioned in a story by the New York Post.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/why-rob-manfred-must-make-a-harsh-example-of-illegal-sign-stealers/">From Joel Sherman:</a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>In recent days I have had scouts and executives talk to me about a variety of methods they think have been or could be employed, such as a realistic-looking electronic bandage placed on a player’s body that buzzes in real time to signal what is coming — one buzz for a fastball, for example — if the surveillance determines what type of pitching is coming. One person I spoke to has ties to the Astros and said he already had spoken to MLB’s investigators.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>So the details are off slightly, but it's close to enough to generate interest.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>Who is the Reddit user posting about the Astros?</h3>
      <p>There are theories on Reddit that "meme-engineer" is actually an Astros whistleblower. One theory points at former assistant general manager Brandon Taubman, who was fired on On Oct. 24, 2019, the same day that comment was posted. It's an odd coincidence, but there's nothing else suggesting Taubman is involved.</p>
      <p>The posting history of "meme-engineer" is bizarre, to say the least, and the user claims to be a Rays fan. The user commented a few other times about the Astros cheating, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/dm7jov/game_thread_world_series_game_2_nationals_1/f4yjeoy/">including</a>, "I feel like the Astro's line up has the ability to guess which pitch is coming correctly more than any other line up in baseball."</p>
      <p>So is this just some random person who happened to get some details right on this scandal? Or is it someone who has some knowledge of what went on in Houston? It's impossible to know now without more details, but it's an intriguing incident — at the very least.</p>
