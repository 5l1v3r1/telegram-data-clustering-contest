      <h1>CBD Melbourne: Liberal loyals line up for key positions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:59</time> by <a rel="author">Samantha Hutchinson and Kylar Loussikian</a></address>
      <p><b>Tony Nutt’s </b>lengthy and almost no-holds-barred post-mortem of the Victorian Liberal division’s botched 2018 state election effort is predictably dominating chatter in the parliamentary party.</p>
      <p>But for Liberal members outside the Spring Street bubble, it’s AGM season, as local branches shore up their office-bearers for the year ahead and a contentious state council scheduled for this weekend.</p>
      <p>Some branches including newly installed MP <b>Katie Allen’s </b>Higgins branch have their pick of Collins Street for key positions.</p>
      <p>After all, candidates up for election on Tuesday in Higgins included JB Hi-Fi chief executive <b>Richard Murray</b>, former state director and Carlton United Breweries executive <b>Julian Sheezel, </b>Enterprise Connect boss <b>Natalie Stirling</b> and Myer media boss <b>Martin Barr</b>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, other branches attract a more diverse crowd, including Burwood, the seat former state MP <b>Graham Watt</b> lost to Labor’s most colourful new arrival <b>Will Fowles</b>.</p>
      <p>The branch in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs had its AGM on Tuesday night. Watt, who also spent some time this year working for Chisholm MP <b>Gladys Liu</b>, made it into the vice-president’s position.</p>
      <p>But the result of the treasurer’s ballot raised some eyebrows, with prominent LSD campaigner <b>Greg Kasarik</b> winning the post.</p>

      <p>Kasarik, made headlines in 2017 when he arrived at Melbourne’s Magistrates Court as a defendant in a hearing, and volunteered on the stand that he was breaking the law because he was carrying an illegal drug – LSD – in his pockets.</p>
      <p>He was escorted outside by three cops, who arrested and then charged him again. He wasn’t trying to break the law, he said, but described his admission as part of a strategy to try to get the drug LSD regulated by the state government so he and other users could trip safely.</p>
      <p>“The reality is some bastard has got be bunny and I’m happy to make the sacrifice,” he told Nine at the time.</p>
      <p>Call it a novel – if not noble – cause. But good luck trying to get a Free Acid discussion item onto the conservative party’s state council agenda for this weekend. We’ll keep you posted.</p>
      <h3>A SHORT SEA CHANGE</h3>
      <p>Former Nine Entertainment boss <b>David Gyngell</b> barely managed five minutes in the witness box on Wednesday, having been hauled to Melbourne from his Byron Bay hideout to appear before the corporate watchdog's court pursuit of ex-Tennis Australia director <b>Harold Mitchell</b>.</p>
      <p>Did he talk about broadcasting rights at a 2012 meeting, ASIC's counsel <b>Michael Pearce</b>, SC, queried. Can you write down your mobile number, Mitchell's barrister <b>Nick De Young</b> wanted to know.</p>
      <p>Then, err, that was it. "I come from Byron Bay for that?" Gyngell asked as he left the stand.</p>
      <p>Pearce said: "It’s the first time I’ve seen a witness disappointed to leave the witness box."</p>
      <p>Gyngell is one of several high-profile former media executives to be drawn into the legal action against Mitchell and his fellow former Tennis Australia director <b>Stephen Healy</b>, with the regulator claiming they had breached their duties to help Seven West Media secure broadcast rights.</p>
      <p>Among those to be called are Seven executive <b>Bruce McWilliam</b>, former Ten chief <b>Hamish McLennan</b> (now the chairman of REA Group) and one-time Nine managing director <b>Jeffrey Browne</b>.</p>
      <p>But the trip south wasn't a total waste of time for Gyngell. We spotted him breaking bread with Browne at Spring Street's Di Stasio Citta the night before his court date.</p>
      <h3>FRIENDS FROM WAY BACK</h3>
      <p>It has been a nightmare week for Victorian politicians of both major parties this week as Ferrari-driving developer <b>John Woodman </b>and the City of Casey’s colourful former mayor <b>Sam Aziz</b> go under the microscope of the state’s anti-corruption watchdog.</p>
      <p>While Aziz hot-footed it out of the country to Egypt after he first met Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission investigators, his links to other politicians, local councillors and power brokers will come under scrutiny at the commission.</p>
      <p>It's a wide cast of characters given Aziz worked alongside the AFP and ASIO inside the Attorney-General’s office before spending 14 years working as a director in Customs.</p>
      <p>Victoria Police Chief Commissioner <b>Graham Ashton</b> is also a former colleague.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, Aziz also had a stint working with Ashton, who was an Australian Federal Police officer working out of Indonesia and Melbourne in the late 1990s, before becoming national manager of counter-terrorism in 2003.</p>
      <p>And in 2017 City of Casey residents recall Ashton visiting the region to attend a neighbourhood watch meeting alongside Aziz, who introduced the police chief as a “friend” and spoke at length about how the pair had worked closely on a number of joint operations.</p>
      <p>This week a spokeswoman for Ashton accepted the pair had worked together.</p>
      <p>Whatever the project was, it was short-lived, apparently.</p>
      <p>“Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton knew Mr Aziz in a professional capacity during a brief period when he was working at AFP,” a spokeswoman said on behalf of Mr Ashton, but she refused to say anything else, including the extent of the working relationship.</p>
      <p>“It would be inappropriate for him to be commenting on any claims made against Mr Aziz.”</p>
