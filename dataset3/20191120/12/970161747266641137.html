      <p>When Maverick Austin’s daughter 11-year-old Avi called him to say she had pooped her pants, he was sympathetic and rushed to get her a change of clothes.</p>
      <p>But when she called a few hours later to say it had happened again, he wasn’t impressed.</p>
      <p>With a busy day ahead, the single dad, from Texas, promised to sort it when he could.</p>
      <p>He even said: ‘just wipe your butt better then stuff toilet paper in the back of your pants and I’ll have to call you back in an hour!’</p>
      <p>But a few minutes later, he realised that it was actually blood and not poop – his daughter had actually got her first period.</p>
      <p>So he dropped everything and raced to school to find Avi and explain.</p>
      <p>Luckily, by the time he got there, Avi had realised what was happening.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Posting on Facebook, he said: ‘I interrupt my project meeting and explain to my banking colleagues that I’m VERY sorry but I have to go.</p>
      <p>‘I’m racing to the school while calling them telling the nurse to “go find my child!”. Speeding and having a panic attack because my child called me for help and I just “left her to die on the battlefield”!</p>
      <p>‘I run in the office and she’s standing there very calm looking at me and says “Dad…. I officially started my first …” and I stopped her and said “I already know Avi… it hit me a few minutes after I hung up on you”</p>
      <p>‘The stress of raising a daughter.’</p>

      <p>Avi joked that she deserved something like when your tooth falls out so her dad created ‘the period fairy’.</p>
      <p>So to make her feel better about her first period, he bought her chocolate, ice cream, cookies, flower and a ‘you’ve got this!’ card, while she was in the shower.</p>
      <p>The post soon went viral with over 128,000 shares and 199,000 likes.</p>
      <p>People praised Maverick for how he reacted to the moment in his daughter’s life.</p>
      <p>Elina said: ‘Wow, I’m impressed with how amazingly you handled that!! Oh &amp; BTW, I think you might be onto something there with the period fairy!’</p>

      <p>He added: ‘I wasn’t sentimental at all because she’s such a jokester and was making fun of me for getting her a card lol</p>
      <p>‘THEN I go lay on the couch and I come back later into the kitchen and she NEVER gives me more than like 2 M&amp;Ms….. so I look on the counter and she had left me a heart made out of M&amp;Ms!!!! That’s like 12 M&amp;Ms!!! Yep I had to run to my room cuz I got a tad bit emotional.’</p>
