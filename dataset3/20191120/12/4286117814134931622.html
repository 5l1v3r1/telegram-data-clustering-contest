      <p>Seems like Smriti Irani is a fan of minions and we are a fan of her minion memes. The Bharatiya Janata Party minister is known for her social media game and her sense of humour. She keeps posting memes based on herself and her husband, Zubin Irani and these memes give us a hearty laugh.</p>
      <p>The coolest minister recently took to Instagram and shared a very important message for her friends. The first Instagram story read, "It's hard to find a friend who is cute, loving and smart. My advice to all my friends, don't lose me."</p>

      <p>Her second story was also about her friends, proving that she was missing them. The second gram read, "Raftaar kuch zindagi ki yun rakh galib ki dushman bhale aage nikal jae par dost koi peeche na chute."</p>

      <p>The Textile minister is the youngest in the Council of Ministers. The 43-year-old is also the Minister for Women and Child Development.</p>
      <p>Smriti Irani became a household name after she starred as Tulsi in the hit show, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. The show ran for 8 years.</p>
