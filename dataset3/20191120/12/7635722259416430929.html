        <b>The European Tour has postponed the upcoming Hong Kong Open due to continued political unrest in the area.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement today the European Tour, in conjunction with the tournament co-sanctioning partner at the Asian Tour, has taken the decision to postpone next week’s Hong Kong Open.</p>
      <p>The event was scheduled for the Hong Kong Golf Club, Fanling from November 28 to December 1. An attempt will be made to reschedule the tournament in early 2020.</p>
      <p>Keith Pelley, Chief Executive of the European Tour, said: “The decision has been taken due to the ongoing level of social unrest in Hong Kong.</p>
      <h3>Safety</h3>
      <p>Pelley added: "As the safety of our players, staff, stakeholders and everyone involved in each and every one of our tournaments around the world is our top priority, we feel this is the correct, but unfortunate, course of action.</p>
      <p>“The European Tour thanks everyone at the Hong Kong Golf Association, the Hong Kong Golf Club and all persons associated with the Hong Kong Open for their hard work in endeavouring to stage the tournament.</p>
      <p>"We look forward to hopefully returning early next year.”</p>
      <p>Cho Minn Thant, Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the Asian Tour said: “It is regrettable that the Hong Kong Open has to be postponed due to the ongoing unrest in the city.</p>
      <p>“The unpredictability of the current situation in Hong Kong makes it very challenging to sanction the tournament especially with the safety of every one of utmost importance.</p>
      <p>"However, we are optimistic that once the situation in Hong Kong stabilises, we will be in a better position to sanction the 61st edition of the Hong Kong Open in the very near future.”</p>
