      <p>It's only been a couple of months since we posted a review of the <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/oneplus-7t-android-smartphone-review">OnePlus 7T</a>, but in the time that has elapsed, there have been numerous leaks and rumors centered on the unannounced OnePlus 8 Pro. If you were hoping for a reprieve from another leak today, well, our apologies. Instead of a reprieve, you get some diagrams to look at.<br/><br/>The diagrams are mostly in line with previously leaked renders, so there's not a lot that is new. However, they do outline (quite literally) some changes OnePlus is making to its next flagship phone, assuming these are legit.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most interesting (to some people) is the pill-shaped cutout in the front of the handset. The OnePlus 7T debuted with a teardrop notch similar to the one that started it all (Andy Rubin's Essential Phone), and both the OnePlus 7T Pro and <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/oneplus-7-pro-android-smartphone-review">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> sport a motorized pop-up camera for snapping selfies.<br/><br/>One of the supposed design documents lists the selfie camera implementation as "tentative," though the idea of using a punch-hole cutout is consistent with past leaks.<br/><br/>Around back, the diagrams show a triple camera configuration arranged vertically, flanked by a fourth sensor of some sort to the left. This is listed in one of the documents as a Time-of-Flight sensor to aid with 3D depth sensing chores (also "tentative").<br/><br/>Outside of the camera configuration, the diagrams seemingly confirm the same button layout as the previous flagship. Unfortunately, none of the documents get into the nitty-gritty details, such as panel size and resolution, internal hardware, and so forth. That said, one of the rumors floating around is that the OnePlus 8 Pro will feature a <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/oneplus-8-pro-boost-refresh-rate-smoother-display">120Hz display</a>.<br/><br/>We will find out soon enough how these leaks stack up to the final product, as the OnePlus 8 Pro is expected be be unveiled on January 23, 2020.</p>
