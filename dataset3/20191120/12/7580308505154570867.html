      <p>On the heels of getting sentenced to 46 months in prison, Kodak’s willing to get a college diploma by the time he gets out.</p>
      <p>He is interested in pursuing business and marketing. The federal prison in Florida where he’s doing his time offers classes, and he plans to register, according to TMZ.</p>
      <p>His plan does not end at the ones listed above, he also has plans to take the SAT when he’s eventually released in hopes of getting into the University of Florida and earning a bachelor’s degree.</p>
      <p>This follows his previous goal of wanting a GED about a year ago while he was locked up, which he finally got.</p>
      <p>Also, he will be supplementing that with some other literature to get his creative mind active. Good, old-fashioned Friedrich Nietzche books like “The Death of God,” “The Superman” and “The Will To Power.”</p>
      <p>In addition to his nearly 4-year sentence, Kodak was just hit with two new counts of gun possession last week and could get up to 30 more years for each charge.</p>
      <p>Some news media reached out to his lawyer, Bradford Cohen, but he had no comment.</p>
      <p>Bill K. Kapri, better known by his stage name Kodak Black, is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. He is noted for his singles “Zeze”, “Roll in Peace”, “Tunnel Vision”, and “No Flockin.”</p>
      <p>Kodak Black’s music is frequently about “previous and future criminal misdeeds”, and he stated that he’s been influenced by rappers Boosie Badazz and Chief Keef.</p>
      <p>The New Yorker described his “manifestly youthful voice” and “mutinous sound”, and stated, “Kapri joins other young rappers who have rejected an old-school emphasis on lyrical variety, individualism, and personal catharsis.”</p>
