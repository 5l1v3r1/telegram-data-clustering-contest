      <h2>John Dunn told his wife she was a “waste of space” before uttering offensive remarks at her, within a sheltered housing complex.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:54:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:54</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Behan, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/paul-behan/</a></address>
      <p>Dunn, aged 69, of Viewfield Road, Ayr appeared from custody at Ayr Sheriff Court on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
      <p>He admitted behaving in a threatening or abusive manner towards his wife, Louisa Dunn, and that he did shout, swear and utter offensive remarks.</p>
      <p>The offence took place on October 14 this year in Bradan Road, Troon.</p>
      <p>Dunn further admitted breaching his bail conditions on October 17, by entering Bradan Road, Troon, without a reasonable excuse.</p>
      <p>Fiscal Depute Scott Toal said: “The accused and his wife were married for 13 years. They have no children.</p>
      <p>“It seems the accused came back at 5.30pm under the influence and his wife was in bed.</p>
      <p>“A minor argument came about and he said she was a waste of space.</p>
      <p>“And told her to f*** off.</p>
      <p>“The accused continued to swear and so his wife activated the community alarm, linked to a monitoring station.</p>
      <p>“Police were called and the wife was in her bed and the accused in the living room.</p>
      <p>“Officers went to the monitoring station and heard the conversation, lasting 14 minutes and heard the complainer say “leave me alone.”</p>
      <p>“The accused was heard swearing at his wife and he was taken away.”</p>
      <p>At the police station Dunn told officers he had sworn at her.</p>
      <p>Mr Toal outlined the circumstances of the bail breach.</p>
      <p>He said: “He phoned his wife asking if he could attend.</p>
      <p>“He was told, though, that it was a breach of his bail conditions.</p>
      <p>“But the accused arrived in a taxi and under the influence. She let him in but activated the intercom.</p>
      <p>“Officers attended and again he was arrested.”</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Steven Maxwell said: “I am hoping the last three weeks in custody have had a sobering effect on him.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff David Bicket sentenced Dunn to a community payback order, consisting of 12 months of supervision.</p>
      <p>A review and progress report on Dunn’s payback order will take place on December 10.</p>
      <p>Dunn was bailed under the standard conditions.</p>
