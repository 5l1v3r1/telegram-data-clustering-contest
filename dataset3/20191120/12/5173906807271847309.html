        <b>The European Commission on Wednesday reiterated that Portugal's draft budgetary plan for 2020 poses a risk of non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, stressing that the government should present an updated document "as soon as possible".</b>
      </p>
      <p>In its opinions published today on the budgetary plans of the euro area Member States for 2020, the EU executive said that Portugal's draft budgetary plan for next year presents a "risk of significant deviation from the adjustment path towards the medium-term budgetary objective" and "compliance with the reference value for debt reduction".</p>
      <p>Together with Portugal, the European Commission said that "the draft budgetary plans pose a risk of non-compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact in 2020" in the case of Belgium, Spain, France, Italy, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland,</p>
      <p>The EU executive stressed the "importance of these euro area member states including in the updated draft budgetary plans additional measures necessary" to comply with European rules.</p>
      <p>"For Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Finland, the public debt has either fallen below the reference value of 60% of Gross Domestic Product or is following an appropriate path in this direction," the EU executive noted, adding that these four member states "have also achieved a budgetary balance that provides a considerable margin towards the reference value of 3% of GDP.</p>
