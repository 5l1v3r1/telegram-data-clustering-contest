        <b>Toshiba has announced a range of eFuse IC products. The range comprises six products in the TCKE8xx series which support various protection functions for power supply lines.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unlike traditional fuses, eFuses are resettable. They also offer over-current limit accuracy of ±11%, overvoltage protection, and over-temperature protection in addition to short-circuit protection. Offered in a 3x3mm, 0.75mm thin WSON10B package, the devices offer a typical RON of 28mΩ. Input voltages of 4.4-18V are supported and output currents can lie at up to 5A.</p>

      <p>Toshiba says its TCKE8xx products also compare favourably to polymeric positive temperature coefficient (PPTC) devices that are also resettable. “They react significantly faster, can be reset directly via an external logic signal, and retain their low on-resistance even after multiple trip events,” the company claims.</p>
      <p>The TCKE8xx eFuse series is provided in three categories: no overvoltage protection, 5V (VOVC = 6.04V), and 12V (VOVC = 15.1V). Each overvoltage category is also offered in auto-retry or latched options as the response after a fault event.</p>
      <p>The status of the latch type is recovered by the application of an external signal, while the auto-retry re-enables its output automatically.</p>
      <p>The integrated comparator can switch off the output typically within 150ns. An external capacitor can be included to reduce inrush current by setting a turn-on slew-rate at the output as required.</p>
      <p>Provision is also made to support an external N-channel mosfet for reverse-current blocking protection.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer aims at applications including the supply lines to cameras, cordless cleaner and power tools, cleaning robots, server, smart speaker, thermostats and wireless chargers.</p>
      <p>The TCKE8xx series is also certified to IEC 62368-1.</p>
