            <b>DEG Vs TAB Dream11 : Deccan Gladiators look to consolidate their spot at the top of the league standings when they take on struggling Team Abu Dhabi today.</b>
          </p>
          <p>They made a foray into the fray of the Supper League stage having ended up atop of Group A and Deccan Gladiators sit in the pinnacles of the Super League points tally as well after having crushed Qalandars yesterday. The first match of the Super League transpired as many had envisaged for the side with a thumping win seeing them set down a statement and further strengthen their credentials for the glistening trophy.</p>
          <p>Stamping their authority with the bat when they faced off against Qalandars yesterday, Deccan Gladiators enshrined in place a pinch perfect batting performance as they galloped their way to a momentous 128. The bowling display was equally fruitful as their bowlers restricted the opponents to just 104 to see the 24 run win lay down a marker courtesy of an extremely pleasing to the eye display.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>It’s a performance the side will be looking to reverberate today as well when they take on who are floundering and dwindling in seventh place in the points tally. They ended up losing by 27 runs in their first Super League encounter, a result which saw them being thumped in pursuit of 130 as they were refrained to just 102 to be handed over their second defeat in four matches.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>Being a night match, the pitch is going to be one which plays out completely in favour of the batsmen with the wetness in the field helping the pitch settle down. With their being an ominous cloud cover looming over the ground, the side winning the toss is bound to come out and field first and get a cohesive idea of how to peddle out their run chase. </p>

                            <h3>DEG vs TAB Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>It took Mohammad Shehzad a full four matches to get going but the 57 runs the opener doled out yesterday saw him get to the score in just 21 balls as he smashed his way to the fence on 9 occasions which included a colossal six 6s. It was a knock reminiscent of his 100 in the last edition of the league, one which sees us entrust the Deccan Gladiators wicket-keeper as our choice in this facet.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs TAB Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Shahzad found good company in his knock in the form of Shane Watson in that encounter with his counterpart scoring 30 runs as the two openers piled on a massive 60 run partnership for the opening stand t see the Australian accompany him for the day. Dan Lawrence comes in as well for us alongside Bhanuka Rajapaksa from Deccan Gladiators whilst from the opposition we are opting for Avishka Fernando as the first player.</p>
                            <p>The opener put on 51 runs for the side yesterday to see him become an instant selection from the side with Luke Wright entering the ambit of after showing what he’s capable of in his short lived outing in the middle in the same match which saw him hit 20 runs in 10 balls.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs TAB Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Moeen Alli has failed with the bat in the previous few matches for Team Abu Dhabi but the number batting slot which he occupies sees us move in for him instantly. This format is one where the batsmen step out looking to lash at the bal right from the very first delivery, making the player someone who is capable to rope in a slew of points through the boundaries.</p>
                            <p>From the other side meanwhile we are choosing Ben Cutting after he scored 21 runs in 10 balls in the side’s bygone outing along with snagging the one wicket as well to make him the ideal all-rounder to venture in with for the day.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs TAB Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>In a match where both the sides are scoring over 100 runs, when you return with figures of 2-12 with the ball, you have to become the first name to be imbedded for today’s encounter. Ben Laughlin sent down an immaculate display with the ball yesterday, a meticulous spell which saw him snag wickets at crucial junctures to see us earmark his as a frontline quick for the day.</p>
                            <p>Marchant de Lange will be his accompaniment for the day whilst from the other side of the section we will be divulging in the selection of the singular pick of Zahir Khan. </p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Wright will be entrusted with the job of captain for the day while from the other side Watson is our vice-captain.</p>
