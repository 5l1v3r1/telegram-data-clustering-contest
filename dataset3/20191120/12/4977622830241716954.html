      <h1>US Senate Passes Hong Kong Human Rights Bill In Support Of Protesters, Beijing Left Fuming</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:32:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author">Swarajya Staff</a></address>
      <p>The United States Senate on Tuesday (19 November) unanimously passed legislation aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa/u-s-senate-passes-hk-rights-bill-backing-protesters-angers-beijing-idUSKBN1XT2VR">reports</a> <i>Reuters</i>.</p>
      <p>China considers its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters as an internal matter and the bill passed in the US Senate drew condemnation from Beijing.</p>
      <p>Following the voice vote, the “Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act” will now go to the House of Representatives, which approved its own version last month.</p>
      <p>After both the Houses workout their difference on the language and reach a consensus, it can be sent to President Donald Trump for his consideration.</p>
      <p>Republican Senator Marco Rubio said at the start of the brief Senate debate, “The people of Hong Kong see what’s coming - they see the steady effort to erode the autonomy and their freedoms,” and accused Beijing of being behind the “violence and repression.”</p>
      <p>Another bill, aiming at banning the export of certain crowd-control munitions to Hong Kong police forces, was passed, unanimously, by the Senate. It puts a restriction on the export of items such as tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, and stun guns.</p>
      <p>The Bill mandates that, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have to present evidence once a year that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to qualify for special US trading consideration that bolsters its status as a world financial centre.</p>
      <p>The bill also has provisions that would provide for sanctions against officials responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Beijing on Wednesday (20 November), condemned the bill passed in the US Senate and vowed strong counter-measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security.</p>
      <p>“This act neglects facts and truth, applies double standards and blatantly interferes in Hong Kong affairs and China’s other internal affairs,” foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“It is in serious violation of international law and basic norms governing international relations. China condemns and firmly opposes it.”</p>
      <p>The United States must immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China’s other internal affairs, or “the negative consequences will boomerang on itself”, Geng added.</p>
