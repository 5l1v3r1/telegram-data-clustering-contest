      <p>WHEN I told my friends I signed up for a two-week trial at F45, there was a look of horror on their faces.</p>
      <p>Had I gone mad? Did I like torture? Or worse, was I running off to join a cult?</p>
      <p>One of the fastest growing fitness crazes in the world, F45 promises results just as fast, so it’s no surprise people are a little sceptic.</p>
      <p>F for functional training and 45 for the duration of time you’ll sweat your little butt off, F45 is not for the fainthearted.</p>
      <p>Last week I walked into my first class at F45 Canning Vale (with much trepidation and fear might I add) to see what all the hype was all about.</p>
      <p>Before long the nerves had settled and my elevated heart rate had returned to normal.</p>
      <p>That is until I started to workout.</p>
      <p>With a sole focus on team training, F45 is specifically designed to provide a full-body workout, improving energy levels, endurance fitness and strength.</p>
      <p>I was daunted by the thought of working out alongside members who were clearly fitter than me, but rest assured no one will notice if you drop the ball (or weights).</p>
      <p>Everyone works out at their own pace and there is no ‘boot camp’ vibes in the slightest.</p>
      <p>In fact, F45 Canning Vale studio manager and head trainer Farran Batchelor will happily give you tips and guidance during your workout and there is no pressure to perform at a certain level.</p>
      <p>“F45 isn’t like other gyms, it focuses on group fitness with a real emphasis on community,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s fun, fast paced and has lots of variety. No workout will ever be the same, so you’ll never be bored. A mixture of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal training will yield fantastic results in both fat loss and muscle gain.”</p>

      <p>Farran said there were no heroes at F45, just real people getting real results.</p>
      <p>“We are all just trying to better themselves in a happy and healthy environment,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Members turn up to their chosen class time, the workout is already planned, set up and laid out. All the member needs to do is work to the best of their ability.”</p>
      <p>With 6-7 classes every weekday and 4 across the weekend there is bound to be a time that suits you.</p>
      <p>Alternating between cardio and resistance training the classes will kick start your metabolism, push your cardiovascular skills to its limit and leave your muscles burning for hours.</p>
      <p>Or in my case, days.</p>
      <p>For those worried that you don’t have time, classes start from 5am to 6.15pm, catering to both the early risers and night owls.</p>
      <p>It’s now a week since my first F45 class and I’m proud to report I’ve been back several times.</p>
      <p>Unpretentious and a lot of fun (yes I said it) F45 is an endorphin addiction like non other.</p>
      <p>“We want to emphasise that F45 is for everyone. There is no judgement, no drama and it is certainly not a cult,” Farran said.</p>
      <p>“We have members from all walks and in all stages of life, including students, FIFO workers, stay at home mums and retirees. One of our members is 71 years young, she turns up every morning and absolutely crushes it (and puts most of us to shame).”</p>
      <p>So…. I guess I better break up with my old gym then hey?..wonder if I could use the line ‘it’s not you, it’s me?’</p>
      <p>Or..</p>
      <p>‘I’ve found someone better and they make me happier?’</p>
      <p>Yep I’ll go with that.</p>
