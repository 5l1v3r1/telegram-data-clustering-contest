      <h1>How to keep dogs safe and warm this winter as temperatures plummet in Scotland</h1>
      <h2>Dogs Trust is issuing guidance to owners about how to keep your dog safe and warm during the cold snap.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:43+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jennifer Russell, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/jennifer-russell/</a></address>
      <p>This week across Scotland temperatures have plummeted to freezing conditions.</p>
      <p>During this time it is important to prepare your four-legged friends for the cold and wintry <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a>.</p>
      <p>Dogs Trust, the UK’s largest dog welfare charity, is issuing guidance to owners about how to keep your <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">dog</a> safe and warm during the cold snap, including how to avoid potential hazards on your winter walks.</p>
      <p>Catherine Dobbie, Veterinary Surgeon at Dogs Trust, said: “With temperatures dropping and wintery weather on the way, there are lots of simple things you can do to help your <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pooch">pooch</a> stay safe and warm this winter, and things owners need to watch out for that may be hazardous for our dogs.</p>
      <p>“Winter walks can also be a lot of fun, but it’s important to exercise caution when conditions worsen by keeping your dog on a lead and taking steps to improve their visibility when the nights get darker.”</p>

      <p>1. Antifreeze is highly poisonous to dogs. Keep it well out of their reach and mop up any spills immediately. Always seek veterinary advice if you are concerned your dog may have licked or ingested any.</p>
      <p>2. Never leave your dog in a car during extreme weather, hot or cold.</p>
      <p>3. Make sure you wipe your dog’s legs and feet when you come indoors after a snowy walk. The grit from the roads can irritate their feet. Grit can also be dangerous if your dog licks its paws. Again, seek veterinary advice if you are concerned your dog may have licked or ingested any.</p>
      <p>4. Let your dog's winter coat grow, and particularly if you have a puppy, short-haired or old dog, buy them a sensible winter coat to stay warm.   </p>

      <p>1. Keep your dog on a lead if it is snowing heavily. Snow can be disorientating so they might easily become lost.</p>
      <p>2. Make sure your dog is microchipped, the details are up to date, and your dog is wearing a collar and an ID tag whilst out walking, so if they do get lost, they can be reunited with you.</p>
      <p>3. As the days get darker, consider using a reflective collar and lead or a high visibility coat or flashing collar to increase your dog’s visibility in the dark. Owners can wear high-vis jackets too!  </p>
      <p>4. Do not let your dog walk on frozen ponds. The ice may not be thick enough to take their weight. If your dog does fall through the ice never be tempted to go in after them; call the emergency services immediately.</p>
      <p>5. Regularly check that your dog’s leads, collars, and harnesses are all functioning safely and not at risk of wear and tear damage during winter weather.</p>
      <p>6. Snow can freeze between dog’s paws and owners might find ice stuck to the bottom which can be uncomfortable and make it difficult for them to walk. Rinsing and drying their paws after walks is very important.    </p>

      <p>1. If you are spending more time indoors if the weather's bad always make sure your dog has plenty to do – long-lasting tasty chews, or puzzle-toys such as durable food-releasing toys and snuffle mats are useful for giving your dog something enjoyable to do without needing your constant attention.  </p>
      <p>2. You can provide entertainment for your dog when parks are closed by walking different ways to your normal route, so they can experience new sights, sounds and smells.</p>
      <p>3. Incorporate training sessions within your walks - take treats with you and reward your dog for doing a trick along each street you walk down. Bring their favourite toy and have a game outside if there's a safe place to do so while they're safely on-lead.  </p>
      <p>4. You can play these types of games indoors too – try hiding their toys for them to search for and playing with them as a reward when they find them.</p>
      <p>5. Treat your dog to some fun and games that are educational and valuable by enrolling them in a Dogs Trust Dog School training course! We offer short training courses for puppies, adolescents and adult dogs teaching important skills in a fun and positive environment.</p>
