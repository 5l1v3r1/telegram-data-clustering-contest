      <h1>Sunderland fans turn on Phil Parkinson after Gillingham defeat</h1>
      <h2>Phil Parkinson has won just two games.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:45:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland fans are already calling for Phil Parkinson to be sacked after losing to Gillingham.</p>
      <p>Parkinson only replaced Jack Ross about a month ago. In mid-October, Parkinson was named as the successor to Ross in Sunderland’s managerial hot seat but he has had a month of struggles.</p>
      <p>In a busy period, Sunderland have played nine games under Parkinson. But they have only managed two wins. With just two draws as well (including the reverse FA Cup clash with Gillingham), Parkinson has tasted defeat five times.</p>
      <h3>Parkinson out?</h3>

      <p>Five losses in one month is a cause for concern. Sunderland fans now believe that Stewart Donald made a grave error when choosing Parkinson as Ross’ replacement last month.</p>
      <p>Last night was a new low for Sunderland. The Black Cats were dumped out of the FA Cup in the First Round for the first time in the club’s history. Now, a vocal section of Sunderland fans are calling for Parkinson’s head.</p>
      <p>Parkinson is on a two-and-a-half-year contract at The Stadium of Light. But here are some tweets from disgruntled Sunderland fans about his position as manager.</p>
