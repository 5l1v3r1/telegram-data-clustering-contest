      <h1>Why does it always rain on me? A new supercomputer has the answer</h1>

        <b>A new IBM supercomputer powered by Nvidia GPUs is set to enhance weather forecasts across the globe.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nvidia has teamed up with IBM to create a new supercomputer that can deliver more frequent and more accurate weather predictions worldwide.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/11/18/new-ibm-supercomputer-optimized-for-gpus-to-bring-better-weather-predictions-worldwide/">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/11/18/new-ibm-supercomputer-optimized-for-gpus-to-bring-better-weather-predictions-worldwide/">the supercomputer itself</a> is an IBM POWER9 and includes Nvidia’s V100 Tensor Core GPUs – this is tech with specs far beyond your bedroom Fortnite sessions.</p>
      <p>The IBM POWER9 runs the company’s Global High-Resolution Atmospheric Forecasting model which is now able to provide hourly updates over every two miles for around 40 per cent of the globe.</p>
      <p>The new tech will enable the world’s most populated areas – including oceanic hotspots for weather systems – to get much-improved forecasts.</p>
      <p>India could benefit hugely from the system. India has recently suffered one of its worst monsoons in decades and the new model could enable quicker evacuations.</p>

      <p>While regions like the US, Europe and Japan have enjoyed these kind of forecasts for a while now, this supercomputer enables the improvement in locations which previously only received this type of forecast every six hours and over six miles.</p>
      <p>The previous scales meant that the validity of the information could often be a mixed bag by the time it was received.</p>
      <p>Nvidia plays its part when it comes to displaying 3D weather models that represent the complex and sizeable amounts of data.</p>
      <p>The IBM POWER9 runs on a whopping 296 Nvidia V100 GPUs and has to calculate a stunning 1.5 billion data points of weather information. This amount of data points equates to around 54GB of data transferred every half a second.</p>
      <p>Nvidia says that it would’ve taken 2000 Intel Broadwell-based chips to achieve these same results as its 296 GPUs.</p>
      <p>The difference means energy savings too – enabling the system to run on a single row of <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-graphics-card-3431869">GPU</a>-running rack servers rather than the eight rows required to do the same with CPUs.</p>
