      <p>The chief executive of ITV has said it will be “impossible” for BritBox to rival Netflix.</p>
      <p>Dame Carolyn McCall said BritBox would be unable to compete with the global streaming giant’s vast membership and “very deep pockets”.</p>
      <p>The UK streaming service, a joint project by ITV and the BBC, launched in early November.</p>

      <p>Both public service broadcasters hope BritBox will counter the dominance of US streaming giants including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Voice Of The Listener And Viewer’s (VLV) autumn conference in London, Dame Carolyn was asked whether BritBox could rival Netflix.</p>
      <p>She said: “It won’t. We are not trying to rival Netflix. How on Earth can we rival Netflix?</p>
      <p>“I mean, honestly, they are a global company on one-hundred-and-something million subscribers already.</p>
      <p>“They have very deep pockets and their shareholders are absolutely betting on their future, not on their portfolio. They are not having to make any money.”</p>

      <p>“One, it is impossible to rival that. Secondly, in the UK we are totally complementary to Netflix,” she said.</p>
      <p>“There will be nothing really that is on Netflix that will be on BritBox and vice versa.</p>
      <p>“Any BBC and ITV content that is on Netflix currently is coming back. It’s coming home to BritBox when it runs out of its contract.”</p>
      <p>She added: “They are genuinely services that can coexist and they are very different things that can coexist.”</p>
      <p>Dame Carolyn also said it was “unlikely” ITV Studios would ever make a series starring Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly for another channel, like the BBC.</p>

      <p>She said: “Not likely, Ant and Dec. I think they are too associated with ITV probably.</p>
      <p>“They are free. They are not free at the moment but they are independent people. I think that is unlikely.”</p>
      <p>Dame Carolyn was in conversation with former media journalist Torin Douglas.</p>
      <p>The theme of the one-day conference was Public Service Broadcasting: The Threats, Challenges And Opportunities Ahead.</p>
