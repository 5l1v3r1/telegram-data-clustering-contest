      <h1>Pokémon is Helping Nintendo Beat Sony to the UK's Console Top-Spot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:11:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>The Nintendo Switch is poised to end the PlayStation 4’s five-year reign as the UK’s best-selling console. The release of <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> appears to have lead to a spike in sales to help secure the Switch’s hold on the top spot.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-19-nintendo-switch-uk-sales-spike-30-percent-as-pok-mon-sword-and-shield-sets-record">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, nearly 90,000 Switch consoles have been sold in the UK so far this month. During last week’s Pokémon release, hardware sales spiked by 30%, following an increase of 75% the previous week. Those sales were primarily driven by the baseline version of the console, rather than those of the special edition Switch Lite, which commemorates the new games.</p>
      <p>The run-up to Christmas may also have contributed to increased Switch sales, while the approaching end of the current console generation could see PlayStation sales slump a little. That said, the impact of a new mainline Pokémon game shouldn’t be underestimated. With Black Friday and festive discounts on their way, it seems likely that the PS4’s top-spot is destined to change hands.</p>
