      <p>Senior Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde has dismissed the rumours of dissent within the party MLAs over their pending alliance with ideological opponents Congress and NCP.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to India Today TV, Eknath Shinde said that the rumours about unhappy MLAs were baseless.</p>
      <p>"News about MLAs being unhappy are totally baseless. This is a conspiracy. We are a disciplined party and we have full faith in our leader Uddhav Thackeray," Shinde said.</p>
      <p>On the issue of possible CM face from the party, Shinde said that the party wants Uddhav Thackeray to take charge.</p>
      <p>"We all want Uddhav Thackeray to be the CM, but whatever decision has to be taken will be taken by him," he said, adding that Uddhav Thackeray has been unanimously empowered to make a decision on party's behalf.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena, which had fought the Maharashtra Assembly elections in a pre-poll alliance with the BJP, is now seeking form a government with Congress and NCP after the BJP refused to have a rotational CM.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the Congress and NCP have agreed to give the CM post to Shiv Sena for a full five-year term while keeping one deputy CM post each.</p>
      <p>The terms of the alliance are yet to be finalised. The trio is expected to stake a claim at the government in the first week of December.</p>
      <p>In the October 21 Maharashtra polls, the BJP-Sena alliance had secured a comfortable majority by winning 105 and 56 seats respectively in the 288-member Assembly. The Congress and the NCP, the pre-poll allies, had won 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
