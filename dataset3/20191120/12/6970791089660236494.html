      <p>NBA superstar LeBron James has a ride or die in his mom. The Los Angeles Lakers’ day one has come forward to put much more than respect on his name.</p>
      <p>This week, King James <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5FFArCAONM/">shared a personal DM</a> from his mom congratulating him on a game-changing performance.</p>

      <p>Last night, LeBron became the first player – ever – <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28119808/lebron-james-first-player-ever-triple-double-vs-all-30-teams">to score a triple double</a> against every team in the league.</p>
      <blockquote><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/1966/lebron-james">LeBron James</a> completed his triple-double collection on Tuesday. With 25 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists in a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/game?gameId=401160843">112-107 win</a> over the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> superstar became the first player in league history to log a triple-double against all 30 NBA teams, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. (ESPN)</blockquote>

      <p>Bron-Bron also revealed how he learned <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28119808/lebron-james-first-player-ever-triple-double-vs-all-30-teams">about his historic achievement</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“I had no idea,” James said after the win, which moved the Lakers to a league best 12-2. “Coach [Frank] Vogel came in here and said congratulations. I was like, I thought he was joking about my seven turnovers because I’ve been taking care of the ball so much. He said first player in NBA history to have a triple-double versus 30 teams, every team, so I was like, ‘OK. That’s pretty cool.'” (ESPN)</blockquote>
      <p>LeBron <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/lakers-lebron-james-becomes-first-player-in-nba-history-to-record-a-triple-double-against-every-single-team/">needed all four quarters</a> to reach the game-changing accomplishment.</p>
      <blockquote>Late in the fourth quarter, as the Lakers tried to hold off a Thunder team that would just not go away, LeBron caught the ball on the wing and waited for <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1992786/anthony-davis">Anthony Davis</a> to arrive with the screen. When he started to drive, both defenders followed him, and Davis spaced open to the middle of the floor. As he’s done countless times in his career, LeBron made the smart pass, and hit Davis, who knocked down the jumper to give “The King” his history-making 10th assist of the game. (CBS Sports)</blockquote>
