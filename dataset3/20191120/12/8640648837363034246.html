      <p>Light rainfall started well before midnight Tuesday in parts of Las Vegas while the major impact was being felt along the Colorado River Valley.</p>
      <p>“We had two flash flood warnings, one of which has expired, but the other goes until 5:30 a.m. west of Cal-Nev-Ari,” said weather service meteorologist Clay Morgan. “There was a report of 2.5 inches of rain in three hours in far eastern San Bernardino County.”</p>

      <h3>Power outages</h3>
      <p>In Las Vegas, there were 23 outages cutting service to about 1,500 NV Energy customers as of 3:25 a.m. It’s unknown if the outages were all weather related.</p>
      <h3>Snowfall up to 18 inches</h3>
      <p>Snow for the Spring Mountains and Sheep Range is expected to begin to fall Wednesday morning, the weather service said.</p>
      <p>“The Sheep Range has probably had some snow, but we don’t have a way to confirm it at night,” Morgan said. “The cameras on Mount Charleston are dark and it doesn’t look like they’ve had snow yet.”</p>
      <p>Morgan said a winter storm warning still in effect until 4 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Snow may be heavy at times Wednesday afternoon with accumulation generally 4 to 8 inches. Highs will be 41 to 44 in Mount Charleston and 53 to 56 at Red Rock. Southeast winds will range from 5 to 15 mph. The chance of precipitation is 90 percent.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night, rain and snow is likely in the evening, then a chance of rain and snow after midnight. Accumulation will generally be 2 to 4 inches with total accumulation up to 18 inches.</p>
      <p>He said the forecast as of 3 a.m. was for 10 to 18 inches of snow by the storm’s end with the heaviest snow above 7,500 feet.</p>
      <h3>Caution advised</h3>
      <p>Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Jason Buratczuk said Tuesday that the first dose of snow in the mountains could bring crowds to the Mount Charleston area this week.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully this is going to be midweek, so I don’t think we’ll be seeing too much traffic, but it’s still going to attack people who are curious to see snow,” he said. “We just ask that people pay attention.”</p>
      <p>In snowy weather, cars need to be outfitted with snow chains, all-wheel drive or four-wheel drive for the Lee and Kyle canyons, he said. Those heading up the mountain need to park completely off of the road or in a marked parking spot to avoid being towed or getting a ticket.</p>
      <p>The roads need to be clear in case someone becomes stranded or injured on the mountain, he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a matter of safety,” Buratczuk said. “We need to get first responders up here.”</p>
      <p>People should also make sure they have a full tank of gas and a fully charged cellphone, and carry blankets and snacks in case their car breaks down, he said. If the weather comes down hard, there will be troopers and signs warning drivers at the base of the mountain.</p>
      <p>Vehicles that get stuck or are unprepared for winter weather become a hindrance during the snow-removal process.
