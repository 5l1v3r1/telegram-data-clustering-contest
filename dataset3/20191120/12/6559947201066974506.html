      <p>Black Friday is almost upon us, but you can already find a decent amount of deals on top products such as 4K TVs, game consoles, and mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Another great item to keep a keen eye on in the build-up to Black Friday is laptops, and there has never a better time to invest in a new system than the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>The likes of Currys PC World, John Lewis, and Amazon already have a variety of discounts up for grabs online, and we'd expect a few more to pop up as we get even closer to Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>

      <p>This is a bold move, but might give you a little more confidence when making a purchase prior to when the majority of other Black Friday deals appear.</p>
