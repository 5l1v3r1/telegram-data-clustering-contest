      <p>The fourth and potentially most significant day of public impeachment hearings is about to begin.</p>
      <p>Gordon Sondland, U.S. ambassador to the European Union, will testify before Congress on Wednesday as part of the ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Trump, which focuses on whether Trump improperly pressured Ukraine to open investigations that might benefit him politically, including by withholding military aid.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Sondland revised his earlier closed-door testimony to admit he told Ukraine aid to the country that was being held up would likely not be released "until Ukraine provided the public anticorruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks," <i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html">The New York Times </a></i><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/05/us/politics/impeachment-trump.html">reports.</a> As to why Sondland didn't mention this when <a href="https://apnews.com/f2398dd73d3a444eb2257ba245d83af1">he originally testified</a> and said that he didn't "recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens," he said he had since had his recollection "refreshed."</p>
      <p>Of all the witnesses who have testified in the public impeachment hearings so far, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/gordon-sondland.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share"><i>The New York Times </i>reports</a> Sondland is the one who people close to Trump are most concerned about, as they have expressed "worry that he interacted directly with the president about Ukraine and that they do not know what he will say." The <i>Times </i>notes Sondland is also likely to face questions about why he didn't disclose a phone call he had with Trump about "the investigations" on July 26, <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878193/-trump-sondland-overheard-discussing-investigations-diplomat-william-taylor-testifies">which was first revealed</a> during the public testimony of William Taylor, acting ambassador to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The Sondland hearing is scheduled to get underway at 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Also set to testify on Wednesday are Pentagon official Laura Cooper and State Department official David Hale. The impeachment hearing can be streamed below via PBS. Brendan Morrow</p>
