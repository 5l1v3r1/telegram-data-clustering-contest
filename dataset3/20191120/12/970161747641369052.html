      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/meghan-trainor/">Meghan Trainor</a> is absolutely not living her best life following a trip to the dentist – after she had to get all her wisdom teeth taken out.</p>
      <p>And we’re feeling her pain.</p>
      <p>The Lips Are Moving singer shared a snap of herself on Instagram, showing her clutching on to two pals as they made their way out of the appointment.</p>
      <p>She could be seen dressed in all black – with the fluffiest slippers known to man – and sporting a white bandage around her head.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I was initially going to just take one wisdom tooth out,’ the 25-year-old told fans.</p>
      <p>‘The dentist said they all had to go. Wasn’t emotionally or mentally prepared but sure got some great content.</p>
      <p>‘The second vid is me talking to my amazing manager @tommymbruce who literally has my whole heart haha thank u to the amazing dentist and my family for taking such good care of me.’</p>

      <p>In a video to rival the moment Taylor Swift broke down over a banana after getting laser eye surgery, Meghan then blessed us with a clip of her tearfully confessing her love for manager Tommy Bruce.</p>
      <p>While her mouth stuffed was full of what we’re guessing is cotton wool balls.</p>
      <p>She can be seen tearing up, asking: ‘Is this for Tommy? I love you so much Tommy. I can’t cry, it hurts, but I love you so much.</p>
      <p>‘You do so much for me and I love you forever. I miss you.’</p>

      <p>We think Tommy got the hint, hun…</p>
      <p>But Meghan was back to her old self soon after, sharing videos of herself dancing in the car with pals.</p>
      <p>And fans found the whole thing hilarious, with one sliding into her comments to write: ‘THE most iconic wisdom teeth pulling day ever.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘OMG! This is amazing! Made my night! Thanks @meghan_trainor for sharing,’ another agreed.</p>
      <p>While a sweet Instagram user added: ‘Get well soon Meghan sending you lots of love and hugs.’</p>
