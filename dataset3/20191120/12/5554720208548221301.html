      <p>Renowned Bollywood actor and former BJP MP Paresh Rawal has thrown his weight behind the Muslim Sanskrit teacher of Banaras Hindu University currently in the eye of the storm for his religious faith. Terming the protest by a group of BHU students ‘idiocy,’ Rawal said that he was ‘stunned’ by the protest against Professor Firoze Khan.</p>

      <p>“Stunned by the protest against professor Feroz Khan !what language has to do with Religion!?!?!? Irony is professor Feroz has done his masters and PhD in Sanskrit !!! For Heavens sake stop this god damn idiocy!,” Rawal tweeted.</p>
      <p>In his subsequent tweet, the famous Bollywood actor said that by the same logic, the legendary singer Mohammed Rafi should never have been allowed to sing any <i>bhajans. </i>He wrote, “By same logic great singer late Shri Mohammad Rafi ji should not have sung any BHAJANS and Naushad Saab should not have composed it !!!!”</p>

      <p>A group of BHU students have been protesting against the appointment of Firoze Khan as the new Sanskrit professor citing his religious background as Muslim. In a heartening development, the university administration has thrown its weight behind the Muslim professor saying that he was the best man to do the job adding that he was selected after a competitive selection process.</p>
      <p>Professor Khan hails from Rajasthan and has Masters in Sanskrit. A report by Times of India said that his father too was proficient in Sanskrit and sang bhajans at a temple close to where the family resides.</p>
