      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> has put together a new-look backroom team for his role at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>, with a number of his most trusted coaches not moving with him to north London.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese was appointed as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s successor on Wednesday morning, with Spurs sacking the Argentine just five months after reaching the Champions League final following a poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho had the likes of Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna in his backroom team at Manchester United – both of whom were at Spurs too – but has decided to shake things up.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinho-names-joao-sacramento-assistant-manager-tottenham/">The Telegraph</a>, Mourinho has appointed Joao Sacramento as his new assistant manager, who joins the north London club from Lille.</p>
      <p>The former United boss has always stressed that he would have a fully-fledged plan of action ready to go when he arrived at his next club, and he has quickly set about assembling his new team.</p>

      <p>Sacramento comes with a strong reputation in France, having been assistant to Christophe Galtier at Lille as they finished second in Ligue 1 last season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will not reunite with Rui Faria, who is currently managing in Qatar, while long-serving goalkeeper coach Silvino Louro is also not expected to be part of the backroom team.</p>
      <p>According to <i>RMC Sport</i>, Lille goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos – who is also Portuguese – joins Sacramento at Spurs, with Mourinho having watched the French side extensively since leaving United.</p>
      <p>Fitness trainer Carlos Lalin, analyst Giovanni Cerra and Ricardo Formoshino – all of whom were at Old Trafford – will also join Mourinho in north London.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, <i>Sky Sports News</i> report that Mourinho arrived at Spurs’ training ground on Tuesday evening and slept there overnight.</p>
      <p>He has already made a start on planning for Spurs’ weekend clash away to West Ham and will meet his new players for the first time on Wednesday afternoon, with training pushed back to give the new boss time to prepare.</p>
