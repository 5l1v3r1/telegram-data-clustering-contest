      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:12+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>David May admits he went on 12-day bender and shared a bottle of champagne with a tramp after struggling to cope with his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> exit.</p>
      <p>The defender made 85 appearances under Sir Alex Ferguson but endured mental health issues after being released in 2003.</p>
      <p>May suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon after United's treble-winning 1999 campaign which saw him head to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/huddersfield-town-fc">Huddersfield</a> on loan as he looked to continue his rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>But an injury on his Terriers debut further dented his mental wellbeing before his struggle for fitness saw him axed which pushed May over the edge.</p>
      <p>"I remember driving out of Carrington thinking that's it. What do I do now? I couldn't take it. I just thought that's me done," he told to the <a href="https://www.manutd.com/en/news/detail/david-may-reflects-on-how-tough-it-was-to-leave-man-united-in-latest-utd-podcast">club's official Utd Podcast</a> .</p>

      <p>The two-time Premier League winner thought his United exit was the final nail in the coffin of his career with his 33rd birthday around the corner.</p>
      <p>"I did (cry). I filled up thinking what do I do? My career is over, finished," he continued.</p>
      <p>"I just went on a 12-day bender on my own in my apartment. We were celebrating (the league title win) but needed to go to bed so I got a bottle of Krug champagne and left (the party).</p>
      <p>"This tramp was on a bench in the gardens so I walked over and started chatting. It must have been around one o'clock in the morning.</p>

      <p>"Me and this tramp ended up drinking the bottle. I gave him the rest of the bottle and that was the start of my 12-day bender."</p>
      <p>But upon realising he had to put an end to his alcohol-driven bender redemption soon found him.</p>
      <p>He added: "(The 13th day?) I thought I can't continue to do this. I need to get home. What I'm doing is wrong.</p>
      <p>"That was probably the depression that I needed to get out of myself and I did that by drinking.</p>
      <p>"I went home, went on holiday, got a call from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> and went there for 12 months and then retired. So there you go."</p>
