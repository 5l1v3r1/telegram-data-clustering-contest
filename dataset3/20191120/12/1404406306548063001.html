      <p>Brian "Glaze" Gibbs opened up to VladTV about Pappy Mason not consulting with The Round Table before ordering the hit on officer Edward Byrne, which Gibbs explained ultimately disbanded the crew. Gibbs said that he was picked up first because all of the officers in the area thought that he would've been crazy enough to do it. However, Gibbs explained when the reward money for information started climbing up to $40,000, family members started naming off Pappy Mason. Four members of the crew were ultimately convicted, and Gibbs explained how Byrne's murder led to the government's "War on Drugs."Â </p>
