      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) managed to preserve support at $8,000 on Nov. 20, continuing an uneasy sideways pattern since dipping to $7,990 the day before.</p>

      <h3>Bitcoin markets “more bearish than expected”</h3>
      <p>Data from Coin360 showed BTC/USD ranging between just above $8,000 and a 24-hour high of $8,150, with volatility limited since Tuesday. </p>
      <p>Previously, Bitcoin had fallen from highs of $8,600 to briefly reenter the $7,000 range before rebounding to press-time levels. </p>

      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/willy-woo-8k-bearish-bitcoin-price-in-unique-setup-before-halving">reported</a>, the behavior has turned analysts broadly bearish on the Bitcoin price outlook, not just for the short term, but up to and including next May’s block reward halving. </p>
      <p>In particular, Willy Woo and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tone-vays">Tone Vays</a> confirmed the overall bearish market sentiment on Wednesday, even anticipating a potential drop to $4,500 for Bitcoin. </p>
      <p>For regular Cointelegraph contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/michael-van-de-poppe">Michaël van de Poppe</a>, the prognosis was also for downward movements if signs of a rebound failed to materialize.</p>
      <p>“1) Break back above and hold this support. Break back to $8,300 would be nice. 2) Lose it -&gt; $7,800 and $7,300 next areas to aim,” he summarized in his latest <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1196526162304020484">Twitter update</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the subsequent sideways period was a surprise. “The price of $BTC is not accelerating down, which is interesting,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1196794120490168322">added</a>.</p>
      <p>Fellow contributor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/authors/filbfilb">filbfilb</a> meanwhile agreed with Woo and Vays. “I agree that the market is more bearish than we expected it to be,” he said in private comments on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Altcoins limit previous losses</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/altcoin">Altcoin</a> markets showed similar restraint to Bitcoin on Wednesday after a day of heavy losses. Out of the top twenty cryptocurrencies by market cap, most saw moves of less than 1% up or down. </p>
      <p>Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>), the largest altcoin, is up 0.91% on the day to remain around the $175 mark. </p>

      <p>Some fared poorly, notably VeChain (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/vechain">VET</a>), which shed 8.5% after posting strong performance in line with other Chinese coins, but managed to slightly recover to $0.0065 by press time. Tezos (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/tezos">XTZ</a>) meanwhile is seeing gains of over 5%.</p>
      <p>The overall cryptocurrency market cap is $221.4 billion, with Bitcoin’s share at 65.27%.</p>
