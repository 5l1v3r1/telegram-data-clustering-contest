      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">’s Newsnight interview</a> has wiped <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/general-election-2019/">the general election</a> off many front pages for a few days.</p>
      <p>It is hardly surprising that eyebrows are raised when proven sex offences by his millionaire friend Jeffrey Epstein are only described as ‘unbecoming’ – but let’s not take our eyes off the main event.</p>
      <p>Whatever you think about the Queen’s second son, he isn’t a candidate in this election, let alone aspiring to lead our Government (he does however need to talk to the FBI rather than the BBC).</p>
      <p>While we were distracted with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-was-at-pizza-express-day-accuser-claims-she-was-forced-into-sex-with-him-11168884/">Woking’s Pizza Express</a>, we forgot that there is a sleeping giant in this election: the rights of women. </p>
      <p>I remember when Donald Trump was elected as the president of the US and I felt grateful that I lived in the UK. We would never elect a man like him I thought, and now we are at that crossroads.</p>

      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a>, like Trump, gets away with almost everything.</p>
      <p>He cloaks his racism in so-called caustic wit, and pawns off his women problems as private business, but there are just too many unanswered questions for the man who wants to be elected as prime minister of our great country.</p>
      <p>Financial matters relating to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/jennifer-arcuri-says-special-relationship-boris-johnson-11173714/">Jennifer Arcuri’s ‘very special relationship’ with Johnson</a> are conveniently parked for now, so we won’t know if he misused public funds until after the election – how can that be right? In the meantime, he has reportedly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/us-business-woman-jennifer-arcuri-said-boris-johnson-cast-aside-like-gremlin-11168572/">‘cast her aside like a gremlin’</a>, a mere inconvenience.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/me-too/">#MeToo movement</a> happened for a reason and women find their voices when they feel that they are not alone. Similarly, we have likely not heard the last of Charlotte Edwardes, who wrote about how <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/29/boris-johnson-denies-squeezing-journalists-thigh-under-table-10829571/">Johnson placed his hand on her thigh and gave it a ‘squeeze’</a> – but you have to wonder what has happened since she found the strength to speak out.</p>

      <p>Some say none of this matters, that Johnson being Britain’s Trump and that all of his abusive, entitled attitudes and behaviours have been ‘priced in’ by the electorate.</p>
      <p>It is the most frustrating thing I have ever encountered: ‘Oh, it’s just Johnson,’ they say.</p>
      <p>He is asking people to vote for him as prime minister of our country! </p>
      <p>Women have suffered under this Government and it is time for change. It is time for investment in women and public services. This could be the election where we finally emerge into the 21st century and women collectively blow the whistle.</p>

      <p>When I was 19, I was subject to a campaign of sexual workplace harassment that shaped my subsequent politics. So forgive me if I hope that for all the other real and constructed narratives, women may finally find their voices at this vital moment for our country and the world.</p>
      <p>Nearly a decade of Tory and coalition austerity has been devastating for women.</p>
      <p>Just last week, we learned that from 2016 to 2018 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) imposed targets for hard-pressed prosecutors to pursue easier cases in order to ensure convictions, rather than tackle the most difficult ones – like rape.</p>
      <p>If more difficult cases are dumped on the ‘too hard pile’, rape and other sex offences become effectively decriminalised.</p>
      <p>There has never been a more important time to ensure that we vote to undo cuts to the judicial service. I’m pleased that Labour will reverse all the cuts to Early Legal Help – legal aid for people prior to them appearing in court – under a Jeremy Corbyn Government.</p>
      <p>People are continually trying to sell this as the Brexit election, but it is so much more than that. </p>
      <p>It’s now time for women to fight back and make our voices heard on the issues that matter to us.</p>
      <p>If you are upset by the reality of abuse of power, so often used against the half of the population that has been silenced for too long, use your vote to show it.</p>
