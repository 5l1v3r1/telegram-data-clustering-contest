      <p>A farmer used his tractor to help a lorry driver out of trouble when he got stuck in the mud in a country lane.</p>
      <p>Officers from Swadlincote Response Unit were called to the scene in Stanton-by-Bridge after the lorry got stuck and partially blocked the road.</p>
      <p>The report came in at 9.55am this morning, Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>The lorry had ended up in a hedge at the side of the road near Swarkestone and, when trying to get out, got stuck in the mud.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said: "Swadlincote Response Unit went out to where it had happened on the A514, when a lorry had got stuck in the mud.</p>
      <p>"The lorry driver was trying to get out of the mud, but it kept wheel-spinning and he was really struggling.</p>
      <p>"A farmer was there when officers arrived and was helping to tow the lorry out of the mud. The road is now cleared."</p>
