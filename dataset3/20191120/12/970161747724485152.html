      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> fans will be sorely disappointed when for the second year running there will be no Christmas Day special – but they could be in for a New Year’s Day treat instead.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, fans were treated to the first New Year’s Day special for the long-running sci-fi show, which saw Thirteenth Doctor Jodie Whittaker face the Daleks for the first time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/doctor-confirm-series-12-filming-wrapped-epic-video-jodie-whittaker-11183204/">Now that filming on the up-coming series 12 has finished</a>, Whovians are eagerly awaiting the Time Lord’s return – and they could be in for less of a wait than they initially thought.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/no-doctor-who-special-christmas-20917725">The Mirror</a>, the show will return with a blockbuster, two-part special to utter in its new run of episodes, with the first instalment airing at the turn of 2020.</p>
      <p>A source spilled: ‘It’s going to be huge. The scale is just epic. No one will be disappointed.’</p>

      <p>A rep for Doctor Who refused to comment.</p>
      <p>TARDIS companion Bradley Walsh<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/doctor-whos-bradley-walsh-warns-fans-of-terrifying-new-monsters-ahead-of-series-12-11165580/"> has already teased that fans can expect to see some ‘terrifying’ new monsters</a> on the 12th run of the re-booted series.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve got to say, be prepared for the monsters,’ he said. ‘There are some monsters that will absolutely make your hair curl.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a couple of monsters they’ve come up with that are absolutely terrifying,’ <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-11-15/doctor-who-series-12-monsters/">he added to Radio Times</a>. ‘Absolutely terrifying.’</p>
      <p>Considering the legacy the show has for creating scary delights – from the Daleks to the Weeping Angels – we’ll prepare ourselves for the nightmares.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, viewers will get the news they’ve been craving soon as the Doctor Who’s official Twitter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/doctor-confirm-series-12-filming-wrapped-epic-video-jodie-whittaker-11183204/">has already teased a massive announcement is coming in just three days time</a>.</p>
      <p>The date of November 23 is very significant, especially for the hard-core fans, who will recognise this as the day when the show’s first-ever episode was aired all the way back in 1963.</p>
      <p>And speaking of the new series – A former star of the show has also claimed that the next cycle could be the best yet, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/doctor-whos-jodie-whittaker-will-be-better-than-ever-in-her-second-series-just-like-david-tennant-and-matt-smith-before-her-11048976/">and that Whittaker herself will be ‘better than ever’</a> in her second run, just like David Tennant and Matt Smith before her.</p>
