      <h3>Saquon Barkley injury update</h3>
      <p>Before the Giants’ Week 11 bye, Barkley had admitted to not being 100 percent in his return from an ankle sprain and he was on the off field in Week 10 because of a dinged-up shoulder. That could partially explain his 13 rushes for one yard against the Jets. There haven’t been new reports during the bye, but you’d expect it could only have helped Barkley with both injuries. The Giants play at Chicago on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Across New York’s past three games, the best yards per carry Barkley averaged was 3.4. Ideally, he’ll be better after a week off, but it’s hard to know until he’s back out running the football Sunday. If he’s active, you can’t sit him in fantasy.</p>

      <h3>Jordan Howard injury news</h3>
      <p>Howard (shoulder) was a limited participant in Eagles' practice last week before missing Sunday's game. As of Sunday, he'd yet to be cleared for contact. Eagles head coach Doug Pederson <a href="https://twitter.com/danieljtgallen/status/1196477603768602624?s=20">said Monday</a>that Howard is "progressing nicely" and "doing well," but didn't go into further detail.</p>
      <p>Philadelphia seemed to expect Howard to be cleared or the signing of Jay Ajayi would've happened earlier last week. Howard will be a solid RB2 if he plays in Week 12 against Seattle, and if not, Miles Sanders should see around 80-percent of the snaps again, like he did in Week 11.</p>

      <h3>Will Devonta Freeman play Week 12?</h3>
      <p>After missing Week 11, Freeman (foot) is "trending in the right way," Falcons head coach <a href="https://twitter.com/vxmcclure23/status/1196528899359989761">Dan Quinn said Monday</a>. Quinn doesn't expect Freeman to practice Wednesday but could see him returning to the field Thursday. Atlanta plays the Buccaneers' strong run defense Sunday.</p>
      <p>Freeman's return would spell the quick end of fantasy value for Brian Hill, who was a hot waiver wire commodity just a week ago. Hill wouldn't be more than a FLEX play against Tampa Bay as the starter, anyway.</p>

      <h3>Matt Breida injury update</h3>
      <p>Breida wasn't able to participate in any team portions of practice last week, only getting side work in, before missing Sunday's game. It would be foolish to expect a return from his ankle injury before he can make it back to the practice field in at least some capacity. Kyle Shanahan <a href="https://twitter.com/nwagoner/status/1196581574038478851?s=20">said Monday</a> that they'll make a determination later in the week on the players that missed Sunday's game.</p>
      <p>If Breida misses Week 12 against the Packers, Raheem Mostert would remain the priority backup to Tevin Coleman. The 49ers play on Sunday night, so hopefully the San Francisco decision-making happens earlier than that for the sake of fantasy owners. Tevin Coleman remains an RB2 against Green Bay, while his backup can be used as a FLEX.</p>
