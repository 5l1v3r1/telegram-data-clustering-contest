      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/xiaomi">Xiaomi</a> has <a href="https://www.weibo.com/5836533026/IgKrZhFwS">announced</a> its very own <a href="https://www.fonearena.com/blog/298355/xiaomi-mi-reader-price-features.html">e-reader</a>, it's called Mi Reader. This device has been announced in the company's homeland, and it's meant to become an alternative to Amazon's offerings.</p>
      <p>The Xiaomi Mi Reader comes with rather thick bezels, which is not surprising considering this is an e-reader. You need to get a good grip when you're holding it, that's the most important part. Accidental display presses not an option.</p>
      <h3>The Xiaomi Mi Reader comes with an e-Ink display, and anti-glare finish</h3>
      <p>The Xiaomi Mi Reader comes with a 6-inch 1024 x 768 e-Ink display, which equals 212 PPI. This device offers a 24-level adjustable front-lit LED reading light. That LED reading light should make content easy and comfortable to read in any lighting condition, basically.</p>

      <p>That display also comes with an anti-glare finish, which is quite important for comfortable reading. Glare is something that can get really annoying on smartphones, especially those with curved displays.</p>
      <p>This e-reader weighs 178 grams, and it comes with a grippy backplate. It is fueled by the Allwinner B300 quad-core processor, which is clocked at 1.8GHz.</p>
      <p>Android 8.1 Oreo comes pre-installed on the device, while Xiaomi also included 1GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. Xiaomi says that the Mi Reader can store around 5,000 e-books.</p>

      <p>Baidu cloud is supported on this device, and the same goes for multi-view cloud one-click login and download. The device supports .txt, .epub, .pdf, and Office documents.</p>
      <h3>Several weeks on a single charge</h3>
      <p>A 1,800mAh battery is included in this device, and the Mi Reader comes with a Type-C USB port. The company claims that you'll be able to use this device for several weeks before you'll need to charge it.</p>
      <p>The device was announced in a single color variant. It comes with a dark gray back, and the white front side.</p>

      <p>The Xiaomi Mi Reader is priced at CNY579 ($82) in China. It will become available via Mi Crowdfunding later today, as this is another one of Xiaomi's crowd-funded products.</p>
      <p>There's not much competition in the world of e-readers these days. Amazon's Kindle is leading the market in the US, but most people don't really find the need to get an e-reader.</p>
      <p>Smartphones are quite large these days, and many of them include reading modes. That is more than good enough for most people. E-Ink displays with special reading features are always a better option, though, which is why Xiaomi opted to announce this product.</p>
