      <p>The Crown’s Josh O’Connor has heaped praise on his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/09/princess-diana-cast-crown-emma-corrin-play-lady-diana-spencer-season-4-9140496/">new co-star Emma Corrin</a> as the pair prepare to retell the love story of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a> and Diana, Princess of Wales in season 4.</p>
      <p>Josh was introduced into the iconic <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> series in the newly-released season three, and is now filming for season four – which dictates the time period he meets and marries Diana Spencer (played by Emma).</p>
      <p>It’s speculated that The Crown season 4 will pick up in 1977 and run through to 1990 – during which time the pair met, married, and had their sons <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-william/">Prince William</a> and Prince Harry.</p>
      <p>Speaking to The Wrap, Josh said: ‘I obviously won’t go into exactly what we’re doing, but we’re shooting Season 4 at the moment and Emma’s doing an extraordinary job.’</p>
      <p>‘I think what will be interesting is that, you know, ultimately, we know so much about the Charles and Diana relationship,’ he added. ‘We specifically know a lot about Diana’s side of things, we also know an awful lot about Charles’ side of things.</p>

      <p>‘I think what will be interesting is how Peter [Morgan, showrunner] navigates both sides of things and tells that story from what we know.’</p>
      <p>The breakout star of season three added that whatever happens in the plotline, the show will always return to the two main focal points – the crown, and the power it holds.</p>

      <p>Emma has been seen filming on set as Princess Diana, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/the-crown-season-4-photos-floor-fans-as-emma-corrin-is-identical-to-princess-diana-10880225/">looking like the spitting image of the beloved princess</a> as they recreated the couple’s 1983 tour to Australia.</p>
      <p>Charles and Diana divorced in 1996, which is likely to be documented in season 5, by an entirely new cast as the show ages up once again.</p>
      <p>Season three saw the introduction of Camilla Shand (Emerald Fennell) into Prince Charles’s life as the pair began dating.</p>
      <p>However, the pair soon split, despite Charles’s protests, and Camilla is seen marrying Andrew Parker-Bowles as Charles is sent to the Caribbean as part of his duty in the Navy.</p>

      <p>Following their respective divorces, and Princess Diana’s death in 1997, the pair reunited, and married in 2005, becoming the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall.</p>
