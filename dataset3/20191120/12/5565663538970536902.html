      <p>Zanu-PF Umzingwane MP and former army senior officer Levi Mayohlome has announced that he is quitting Facebook after his account was hacked.<br/><br/>Mayohlome said he was leaving the platform for security reasons as he no longer had full control of his account.<br/><br/>He told his Facebook friends that some things posted on the account were not penned by him but by hackers who had taken partial control of it.<br/><br/>Mayihlome said he will return on Facebook at a later time to interact with friends and also give updates on his Constituency. His colleagues at Zanu-PF said Mayihlome is obsessed about issues of security.<br/><br/>"Its really not a surprise that he deactivated his account. He is obsessed about things to do with security or maybe its because he is a former army person," said a Zanu-PF official.<br/><br/>Before voted as MP in 2018, Mayohlome was employed as Finance Manager by the National Railways of Zimbabwe.<br/><br/>Mayihlome was part of four MPs from Matabeleland South who were very active on social media.<br/><br/>Some of them include Dingumuzi Phuthi, Nqobizitha Ndlovu and Albert Nguluvhe.</p>
