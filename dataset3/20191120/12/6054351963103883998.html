      <h1>A$AP Rocky's Sweden Imprisonment Included In Donald Trump Impeachment Hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:38:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/JustinI" target="_blank">Justin Ivey</a></address>
      <p>Washington, D.C. – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53171/title.aap-rocky-opens-up-about-his-sex-addiction">A$AP Rocky</a> oddly became a small part of presidential history on Wednesday (November 20). U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland mentioned Rocky — who was imprisoned in Sweden this past summer — multiple times during his testimony at the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/trump-impeachment-hearing-coverage-eu-ambassador-gordon-sondland-testimony-live-stream-2019-11-20/">impeachment hearings</a> for <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53291/title.yg-boots-fan-off-stage-for-not-yelling-fuck-donald-trump-at-2019-mala-luna-music-festival">Donald Trump</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>
      <p>In Sondland’s opening statement, the ambassador noted he “primarily discussed A$AP Rocky” with Trump during a July 26 call that’s become a major part of the impeachment proceedings.</p>

      <p>While being questioned by attorney and director of investigations with the House Intelligence Committee Daniel Goldman, Sondland also noted State Department official David Holmes’ testimony helped him remember the conversation.</p>
      <p>“What triggered my memory was someone’s reference to A$AP Rocky, which was I believe the primary purpose of the phone call,” he said.</p>

      <p>Rocky was behind Swedish bars for weeks while awaiting trial on <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.51958/title.aap-rocky-entourage-issue-swedish-beatdown">assault charges</a>. Trump <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52195/title.swedens-prime-minister-wont-yield-to-trumps-request-to-free-aap-rocky">got involved</a> in the situation by reaching out to Sweden’s prime minister, although it’s unclear if it helped at all. He later celebrated the Harlem-bred rapper’s <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52358/title.twitter-erupts-after-donald-trump-appears-to-take-credit-for-aap-rockys-release">release</a> via Twitter.</p>
      <p>Sondland’s call with Trump became part of the impeachment proceedings after it was revealed the president allegedly discussed his request for Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and other Democrats.</p>
      <p>The call to Trump was made on an unsecured cellphone while Sondland was at a restaurant in Ukraine, causing concerns about Russia possibly monitoring the conversation.</p>
      <p>Democrats believe Trump withheld $400 million in military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Trump’s political rivals.</p>
