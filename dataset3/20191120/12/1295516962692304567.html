      <p>"No biggie, just the Kevin Conroy as Kingdom Come Bruce Wayne," Poon wrote in a post that included the first official <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-kevin-conroy-kingdom-come-photo/">photo of Conroy</a> from the crossover. "Thank you to costume designer Maya Mani for taking me in another crazy journey that both my 8 year old self and 36 year old self are jumping with joy."</p>

      <p>Conroy will be the first actor to <a href="https://screenrant.com/bruce-wayne-batman-kevin-conroy-arrowverse-crisis-infinite-earths/">play Bruce Wayne</a> in both animation and live-action, having voiced the character in a variety of animated works for close to 30 years.</p>
      <p>It's unclear just how much of the original comic story the crossover event will adapt. The <i>Kingdom Come </i>storyline sees the world in a much more violent place after Superman retires due to The Joker killing Lois Lane and the staff of the Daily Planet. The Bruce Wayne in that story is an aging Batman who has been broken by a lifetime of violence and uses an advanced exoskeleton to help him move around, a glimpse of which can be seen in the picture.</p>
