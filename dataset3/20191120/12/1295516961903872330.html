      <h1>Disney Denies Disney+ Accounts Were Hacked, No Security Breach Found</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:11:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Adams</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney">Disney</a> has denied reports that <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus">Disney+</a> accounts were compromised and hacked around the time of the streaming service's launch date.</p>
      <p>“We have found no evidence of a security breach,” a Disney representative told <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-plus-accounts-hacked-security-breach-1203410376/">Variety</a>. “We continuously audit our security systems and when we find an attempted suspicious login we proactively lock the associated user account and direct the user to select a new password.”</p>

      <p>“Billions of usernames and passwords leaked from previous breaches at other companies, pre-dating the launch of Disney+, are being sold on the web,” the Disney representative added.</p>
      <p>Disney offers up some tips to users for better online security, recommending they contact customer support at the first sign of unusual activity with their accounts, stating, "“We have seen a very small percentage of users in this situation and encourage any users who are having these kind of issues to reach out to our customer support so we can help them." However, there are still reports that users are experiencing high wait times for Disney+ as of Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Hackers reportedly started <a href="https://www.cbr.com/disney-accounts-hacked-sold-online/">breaking into customers' accounts</a> hours after the service launched. After logging in, they removed all the original user's devices and changed the password and username, giving themselves complete control over the account.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://screenrant.com/disney-plus-shows-netflix-difference-no-opening-titles/">Disney+</a> accounts were then placed up for sale online, with some being priced as low as $3, while others went as high as $11 (the service itself costs $6.99 a month).</p>
