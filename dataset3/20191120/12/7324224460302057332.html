      <h1>Appeal lodged after plans refused for former Kenrick House offices</h1>
      <h2>An appeal has been launched to overturn a decision to refuse plans to renovate a West Bromwich gothic style building which has stood empty for two decades.</h2>

      <p>An application to bring the Grade II-listed Kenrick Building, off Union Street, back into use had been refused by Sandwell Council’s planning committee earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Plans had been submitted to turn the three-storey building, which is now known as Archibald Kenrick House, into flats, office space and storage.</p>
      <p>But an appeal has now been lodged with the Planning Inspectorate to overturn the decision.</p>
      <p>The building, which dates back to around the 1880s, has stood empty for more than two decades.</p>
      <p>It housed manufacturer Archibald Kenrick &amp; Sons, famed for producing a broad range of metal products such as pans and buckles.</p>
      <p>It overlooks the A4182 Kenrick Way and is passed by hundreds of drivers every day.</p>
      <p>The plans - to build six flats into the building, while the first and second floors would remain as office units and the ground floor for storage - were refused by Sandwell Council due to the site being located in an area allocated as local employment land and that adequate provision had not been made for parking.</p>
      <p>Councillor Bob Lloyd, cabinet member for for Inclusive Economic Growth, said: "The planners at Sandwell Council came to that decision (to refuse the plans) for a reason.</p>
      <p>"Sandwell Council always looks to bring our old and historic buildings into use.</p>
      <p>"The frontage of the building is protected and it is considered an important part of the history of the town.</p>
      <p>"I think it is important we protect our heritage buildings and what they look like."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Planning Inspectorate said: “We can confirm an appeal has been submitted in respect of a change of use for Archibald Kenrick House.</p>
      <p>“We are awaiting availability of an Inspector with the necessary experience in considering cases of historic heritage.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime the appeal process has started with parties to the appeal invited to submit statements.”</p>
