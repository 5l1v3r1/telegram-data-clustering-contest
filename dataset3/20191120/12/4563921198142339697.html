      <h1>Poll Shows Trump’s Israel Policy Is Opposed Even by Republicans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:00:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Zuesse</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, November 18th, Reuters headlined <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-usa/u-s-backs-israel-on-settlements-angering-palestinians-and-clouding-peace-process-idUSKBN1XS2BF">“U.S. backs Israel on settlements, angering Palestinians and clouding peace process”</a> and reported that, “The United States on Monday effectively backed Israel’s right to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank by abandoning its four-decade-old position that they were ‘inconsistent with international law,’ a stance that may make Israeli-Palestinian peace even more elusive.” This article made clear that, of all entities Reuters could contact about the matter, only U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thought that these illegal settlements are legal, and even Pompeo was offering no other reason than that “‘The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements is not, per se, inconsistent with international law,’ Pompeo told reporters at the State Department, reversing a formal legal position taken by the United States under Carter in 1978.” It was merely his dictat, as authority for this major U.S. policy-change. </p>
      <p>One poll was recently taken of Americans on the matter. It was done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarborough_Research">Scarborough Research</a>, a joint venture by The Nielsen Company and Arbitron, and its sample size was unusually large for such a poll and employed rigorous sampling techniques. Thus, its findings should be considered to be close to the reality. Here is a summary of that poll’s methodology and findings. [I add my explanations in brackets].</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://sadat.umd.edu/sites/sadat.umd.edu/files/UMCIP%20Questionnaire%20Sep%20to%20Oct%202018.pdf">survey</a> was carried out September 12 – October 9, 2018 online from a nationally representative sample of Nielsen Scarborough’s probability-based panel, originally recruited by mail and telephone using a random sample of adults provided by Survey Sampling International. The national sample was 2,352.</p>
      <p>Q57. As you may know, the United States has been acting as a mediator between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, with the aim of reaching an agreement in the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. Whether or not these efforts succeed, there is a question about what kind of future for Israel and the Palestinians the U.S. should be supporting over the long term, and many analysts feel that time is running out for some options. Here are four possible approaches that are frequently discussed. Please select the one you think the U.S. should support.</p>
      <p><b>Rep Dem Ind Total</b> </p>
      <p>1. A two-state solution: Israel and a Palestinian state side by side. The Palestinian state would be established on the territories that Israel has occupied since 1967. <b>24% 48% 31% 36% </b>[That’s 24% “<b>Rep</b>”; 48% “<b>Dem</b>”; 31% “<b>Ind</b>”; 36% “<b>Total</b>.”]</p>
      <p>2. A one-state solution: A single democratic state in which both Jews and Arabs are full and equal citizens, covering all of what is now Israel and the Palestinian Territories. <b> 33% 36% 38% 35%</b></p>
      <p>3. Annexation without equal citizenship: Israel would annex the Palestinian territories, but keep a majority-Jewish state in the expanded territories by restricting citizenship rights of Palestinians. <b>14% 3% 4% 8%</b></p>
      <p>4. Maintain the occupation of both the territories Israel has captured in 1967 and the Palestinians inhabiting them indefinitely. <b>18% 5% 13% 11% </b></p>
      <p>Refused <b>11% 8% 14% 10%</b></p>
      <p>[<b>71%</b> support either a two-state or a one-state solution (a sort of democratic solution). <b>19%</b> support either “Annexation without equal citizenship” or Israel’s permanent militarily imposed “occupation of both the territories (West Bank and Gaza).” <i>On this question, only 19% support Trump’s Israel policy, but 25% of Republicans do. However, 67% of Republicans don’t</i>.]</p>
      <p>One of the issues of tension between the United States and Israel has been its construction of Israeli settlements in the territories occupied by Israel in the 1967 war. These settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community and have been opposed by every U.S. administration, both Republican and Democratic. The Israeli government has continued to build settlements. … How do you believe the U.S. should react to new settlements?</p>
      <p>1. Do nothing: <b>38% 17% 33% 28%</b></p>
      <p>2. Verbally criticize: <b>30% 22% 27% 26%</b></p>
      <p>3. Economic sanctions: <b>17% 41% 22% 17%</b></p>
      <p>4. More serious action:<b> 9% 15% 11% 12%</b></p>
      <p>[<i>Trump’s “Do nothing” is supported by 28% of American voters. That even includes only 38% of Republicans. 56% of Republicans want some type of at least criticism against Israel</i>.]</p>
      <p>Consequently: Trump has now gone far out onto a far-right limb here in his policies toward the state of Israel and its dictatorship over Palestinians (the people who are the descendants of what were the vast majority of Israel’s population until <a href="http://archive.is/KOYJR">the ethnic cleansing that slaughtered and displaced them</a>).</p>
