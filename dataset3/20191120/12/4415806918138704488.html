      <p>You know that cliché of a frazzled parent running around the 24 hour supermarket just hours before Christmas, trying to buy gifts for the whole family and enough food to feed the five thousand? Well frankly, it’s a scenario that some of us just can’t relate to.</p>

      <p>You’re such a fan of forward planning that you’ve ticked off all your Christmas tasks by the end of November and now you’re free to kick back and enjoy the festive period without the looming stress of getting everything done at the  last minute.</p>
      <p>If you’re one of these freakishly organised Christmas shoppers, we applaud you. Here are some things you might be able to relate to…</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. You’ve got a list that Monica Gellar would be proud of</b>
      </p>

      <p>Everyone knows that the first rule of getting organised is making a great big list and you started ticking yours off as soon as half-term ended.</p>
      <p>It’s colour coordinated, it has several different sub lists and it’s been graded in terms of priority. Controlling? Us?</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. You saved loads of money by buying everything in the sales</b>
      </p>

      <p>The inner saver in you knows that there’s nothing worse than starting January broke and miserable. For this reason, you picked up a bunch of great discounted gifts in the January sales and have had them stashed away all year. Go you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. You’ve colour coordinated your Christmas wrapping</b>
      </p>

      <p>You’re so organised that you had time to actually create a colour palette for your wrapping this year. While others will be using the dog-eared scraps of whatever’s left in the loft, you’ve already snapped up some fresh rolls of paper with colour clashing ribbons and some statement tags.</p>
      <p>Yours will easily be the chicest and most elegantly wrapped gifts under the tree.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. You’ve written all of your Christmas cards</b>
      </p>

      <p>Most people are so disorganised that the people in their lives would be lucky to get a hastily wrapped gift from the nearest petrol station, let alone a neatly written card landing on their doormat on the 1st of December.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. You actually enjoy Christmas shopping</b>
      </p>

      <p>Being organised has some amazing advantages. Rather than fighting tooth and nail to get the last turkey in the supermarket, starting early means you can breeze through the shops before they start filling up.</p>
      <p>Christmas shopping is, dare are we say it, actually fun?</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. You don’t understand people who leave it to the last minute</b>
      </p>

      <p>No, seriously though, why are you sitting on the couch watching Netflix instead of getting your Amazon order in on time?</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. You’re actually excited about the big day</b>
      </p>

      <p>While everyone else is groaning about how there’s only a month left until Christmas, you’re already whacking on Mariah Carey and pulling out your snowman jumper.</p>
      <p>You might very well be the most hated person in your office right now, but who cares? Let the festive fun commence.</p>
