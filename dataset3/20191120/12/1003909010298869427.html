      <h3>Water too precious to be sold</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Eco group pans sale of water from ski hill, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am disappointed the Alberta government has approved the sale of water by Fortress Mountain Holdings to an undisclosed third party. Press Secretary Jess Sinclair was quoted as saying all concerns were reviewed and dismissed as being invalid. I wonder what a valid concern would be?</p>
      <p>This application affects everyone in the Bow River watershed as well as all Canadians. Is all water now for sale to the highest bidder and should it be? Water is too precious to be a commodity. Shame on Fortress Mountain Holdings for being such poor stewards of the land!</p>

      <h3>Sales tax fair to all?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Talk of sales tax just another red herring, Opinion, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris Nelson and Jason Kenney believe it is OK to target benefits for the vulnerable by increasing student debt and de-indexing AISH, and OK to attack public sector employees when Alberta oil and gas employees are still some of the highest paid in Canada.</p>
      <p>Research continues to show Canada’s top one per cent see fastest income growth and tax dips.</p>
      <p>A sales tax is fair, progressive and a steady source of revenue. Universally, everybody pays something but taxes the wealthy who exponentially consume more than average person. Low-income people get relief from rebates.</p>
      <p>Wealthy consumers need to lose their Alberta Advantage by adjusting revenue as well as benefit sides of budgetary processes.</p>

      <h3>Council should heed experts</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: With funding delayed, should city use buses?; Benefits of the current Green Line plan do not outweigh its costs, Opinion, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>The writers make a compelling argument against the Green Line as currently proposed. These three, all with substantial experience in transportation and planning, take issue with the line on a cost-benefit basis. I question the expertise of city councillors on the Stage 1 meetings relative to that of the aforementioned.</p>
      <p>The Green Line, as proposed, going from urban 16th Avenue N.E. to the Shepard Dump only underscores the dismal lack of understanding of mass transit exhibited by the majority of those on council.</p>

      <h3>Not a test but a show of appreciation</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Cherry’s rant shows poppy’s meaning is lost”, Opinion, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>Srdja Pavlovic has accomplished nothing by going on a rant to criticize another rant, the one by Don Cherry. He is wrong when he says the original purpose of the poppy has changed to become a marker for a militarized society. The poppy is as much a marker as it ever was for seeking peace and for showing respect and appreciation for those who have made huge sacrifices in war. The fact that its frame of reference now encompasses all conflicts Canadians have been involved in since 1918 only reinforces its original purpose.</p>
      <p>Wearing a poppy, as Pavlovic suggests, is not a test of one’s loyalty to Canada, but when immigrants wear one, it does show a true appreciation of Canadian history, of what has made Canada a country so many want to become part of. Is this a bad thing?</p>

      <h3>Organ donation saves lives</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: What You Can Do To Help Save A Life, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was in the bone marrow registry for several decades, and was never even a potential match although there were many who died because there was no match available to them.</p>
      <p>My thoughts on donating are very simple: “Would you give your right arm to save the life of your child? Would you please be willing to tolerate a bit of discomfort to save mine?”</p>
