      <h1>Watch highlights from Colin Kaepernick's workout for NFL teams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T12:14:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>After a lot of adjustments, Colin Kaepernick is ready to show NFL scouts what he's got.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the NFL sent out a memo to all 32 teams saying the free agent quarterback wouldessentially have a Pro Day on Saturday, Nov. 16. The workout was initially scheduled to take place at 3 p.m. ET at the Falcons' practice facility. But that fell apart about half an hour before the event was supposed to start.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick's representatives sent out a statement saying the event would be <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/colin-kaepernick-start-time-venue-nfl-workout/1n8phhiij0k0bzukozs57xmvr">relocated to a new place</a> (Charles Drew High School),about an hour away. Due to the relocation, the event was delayed to 4 p.m. ET, although the workout didn't start right at that time.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The location change also meant all of the NFL scouts who came into town would then need to relocate as well. According to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/sports/football/kaepernick-shift-atlanta-area-workout-last-minute/CKrVewY8OAz3yPqW7XJHUN/">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> , about 10 teams had already arrived including theJaguars, Dolphins, Seahawks and Bears. It also meant everyone involved in the workout would need to move, including Hue Jackson, who <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeSilver/status/1195802857603137537">reportedly</a> decided to go to the airport instead.</p>
      <p>The change happened because the NFL, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlesRobinson/status/1195797124027473920">a Yahoo Sports report</a> , rejected all of Kaepernick's wishes. The main point of contention was Kaepernick wantingthe workout to be public. The AJC reported, "One team official said that Kaepernick’s representatives wanted to film the workout and distribute the film because they didn't trust NFL films producing the video."</p>
      <p>It's not clear what role the NFL now has in this event, as many of the details have been changed by Kaepernick's team.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the workout session will continue and you should be able to watch it below.</p>

      <h3>Colin Kaepernick workout updates</h3>
      <p><b>5:55 p.m. ET:</b> Colin Kaepernick apparently plans to do this again. He also sent a message to NFL teams.</p>

      <p><b>5:47 p.m. ET:</b> Kaepernick left the field and appeared to take a moment to talk with supporters who were near the action. It's not clear what else is on schedule for Kaepernick now. He was initially supposed to hold interviews with members of NFL teams, but that was under the league's workout. Kaepernick's decision to change things around may have made it so that the workout was the only thing on the schedule.</p>
      <p><b>5:37 p.m. ET:</b> The workout session appears to be over now as Kaepernick and his receivers are all dapping each other up. The group posed for a photo and walked off the field to a round of applause.</p>
      <p><b>5:34 p.m. ET:</b> The receivers have stepped by making some nice catches in this workout as well.</p>

      <p><b>5:31 p.m. ET:</b> Kaepernick has also been displaying roll out passes to showcase his ability to throw on the run. His receivers have dropped a few passes, and the quarterback has had a few misfires, but overall he's looked good in this workout.</p>

      <p><b>5:28 p.m. ET:</b> Kaepernick has been mixing in deep passes with short passes throughout the workout session. He clearly still has the arm strength he had back when he was on an NFL roster.</p>
