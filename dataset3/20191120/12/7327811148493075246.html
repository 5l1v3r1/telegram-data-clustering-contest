      <p>WESTERLEIGH, Staten Island (WABC) -- A water main break flooded a road and the front lawns of some homes on Staten Island.</p>
      <p>It happened on Watchogue Road at Hawthorne Avenue just after 5:15 a.m. in the Westerleigh section.</p>
      <p>Water could be seen gushing down the street and into the storm drains.</p>
      <p>Water flowed into the street for about two hours until city DEP workers shut down the main.</p>
      <p>At one point, a motorist attempted to drive out of a driveway, only to get stuck in the street.</p>

      <p>No injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>However, local residents were expected to have reduced or no water service. They reported that water flowing from their faucets is brown.</p>
      <p>The city's DOT was requested to survey the street, which appears undermined.</p>
      <p>Buses that run along Watchogue Road are detoured - SIM3, SIM3C and SIM34 buses are affected.</p>
