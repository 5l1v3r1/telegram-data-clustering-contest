        <b>The Justice Minister has moved to 'categorically dissociate' himself from the comments made by Verona Murphy about asylum seekers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Fine Gael by-election candidate for Wexford previously said some asylum seekers would need to be "de-programmed" before coming to Ireland.</p>
      <p>She has since issued two apologies over the remarks.</p>
      <p>Following an initial apology on Sunday night, Fine Gael said Ms Murphy also visited a centre in Waterford to "gain a better understanding of asylum and refugee issues".</p>
      <p>The Immigrant Council of Ireland <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/situation-around-fg-candidates-asylum-remarks-outrageous-immigrant-council-926592">yesterday claimed</a></b> the "apology and the whole situation is very, very outrageous".</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday condemned Ms Murphy's comments, but stood by his party's candidate and said he will "certainly be campaigning with her before polling day".</p>
      <p>Minister Charlie Flanagan today said Ms Murphy's comments were unacceptable and moved to distance himself from them.</p>
      <p>He told the Dáil: "I want to categorically dissociate<b> </b>myself from comments made by Ms Verona Murphy, our own party candidate in Wexford.</p>
      <blockquote>"I believe it's incumbent on all of us to ensure that unacceptable commentary is treated as such."</blockquote>
      <p>Minister Flanagan was responding to questions from Fianna Fáil's justice spokesperson Jim O'Callaghan.</p>
      <p>Deputy O'Callaghan suggested some people in the political domain need to be reminded that it is a criminal offence to make comments which are likely to stir up hatred against certain groups.</p>
      <p>He added: "I think, minister, that should be brought to the attention of certain figures in your own party because of their utterances in recent time."</p>
