      <p>BBC journalist George Alagiah has discussed his reasons for not researching his chances of survival after being diagnosed with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/bowel-cancer">bowel cancer</a>. </p>
      <p>Speaking on the <a href="http://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/podcast">Bowel Cancer UK</a> podcast, the newsreader - who has been the face of the BBC’s flagship <i>News At Six</i> broadcast for over a decade - said he decided not to look up any information surrounding survival rates because the disease is so variable. </p>
      <p> “I decided I didn’t want to know about the survival statistics It’s a very unpredictable disease,” explained Alagiah.  </p>
      <p>“You’re good one week and not the next, good chances one year and not the next.”</p>
      <p>Alagiah was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48625899">first diagnosed</a> with stage four bowel cancer in 2014, when it spread to his liver and lymph nodes. </p>
      <p>He underwent chemotherapy and more than five operations, but in 2017 the disease returned. </p>
      <p>Alagiah now has regular treatment to keep it at bay but has <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7633221/BBC-presenter-George-Alagiah-says-bowel-cancer-knocking-door-everyday.html">said in the past</a> he is not “scared” to die and he’s come to terms with being “one scan away from perhaps knowing that thing is going to happen sooner rather than later”. </p>
      <p>His most recent comments on the disease were made during the first episode of the Bowel Cancer UK podcast’s second series - “In Conversation with George Alagiah: A Bowel Cancer UK podcast’ - which is hosted by the journalist. </p>
      <p>During the episode, which sees Alagiah interview Barbara Hibbert, who has a diagnosis of incurable stage four bowel cancer, he also discussed learning to live with his bowel cancer. </p>
      <p>“It took me about three to six months after my diagnosis to get to a place of contentment,” he told Hibbert. </p>
      <p>“I needed that just to look at my life and say whatever happens, I’m content.” </p>
      <p>Around 42,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year in the UK, <a href="https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/about-bowel-cancer/bowel-cancer/">according to Bowel Cancer UK</a>.</p>
      <p>Ninety per cent of diagnoses are made in people over the age of 50. </p>
      <p>Despite being the fourth most common cancer, it is the second biggest cancer killer, although is extremely treatable if caught in the early stages. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bowelcanceruk.org.uk/about-bowel-cancer/symptoms/">Symptoms include </a>unexplained bleeding from the anus or in faeces, sudden and drastic changes in bowel habits, weight loss and stomach pain. </p>
