      <p>A Hollywood executive suggested Julia Roberts play slavery abolitionist Harriet Tubman in a film about her life, a screenwriter has claimed.</p>
      <p>Tubman, who was black, is one of the best-known women in US history and played a pivotal role in leading enslaved people to freedom on the Underground Railroad.</p>
      <p>British actress Cynthia Erivo plays her in the recently released biopic Harriet, which has been warmly received by critics.</p>

      <p>However, the film could have been very different, according to its screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard.</p>
      <p>Writing in the Los Angeles Times, he said an unnamed president of a Hollywood sub-studio was eager to make the film in 1994 but suggested casting Roberts, who is white, in the lead role.</p>
      <p>He reportedly said: “This is a great script. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman.”</p>
      <p>When it was pointed out that Tubman, who died in 1913, was black, the president is said to have replied: “That was so long ago. No one will know that.”</p>

      <p>Had Roberts been cast in Harriet, it would have been another infamous instance of Hollywood “whitewashing”, a term used to describe the habit of having white actors play non-white characters.</p>
      <p>The actress Scarlett Johansson was criticised for her role in 2017 sci-fi film Ghost In The Shell, which is based on a Japanese anime series.</p>
      <p>Howard, who spent more than two decades trying to get Harriet made, credits the success of Oscar-winning 12 Years A Slave and the Marvel blockbuster Black Panther with opening the door for its success.</p>
      <p>He said: “When 12 Years a Slave became a hit and did a couple hundred million dollars worldwide, I told my agent, ‘You can’t say this kind of story won’t make money now.’ Then Black Panther really blew the doors open.”</p>
      <p>Harriet, which also stars Leslie Odom Jr, Joe Alwyn, and Janelle Monee is in cinemas now.</p>
