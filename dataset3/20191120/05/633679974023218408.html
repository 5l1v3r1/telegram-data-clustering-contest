      <p>Siya Kolisi, our SA sporting hero who led the boks to victory at this year’s rugby world cup in Japan just last month is enjoying a well-deserved break in Paris, the “city of love’,” with his wife Rachel.</p>
      <p>Arguably South Africa’s most celebrated power couple right now, it seems a perfect fit for the pair whose relationship continues to thrive despite the trials and tribulations that come with being in the public eye.</p>
      <p>And who needs the paparazzi when you have Instagram! Rachel has posted some truly down to earth, unairbrushed photographs, and the odd video clip, as they explore the splendour, culture and iconic landmarks of one of the oldest cities in the world. </p>
      <p>Enjoy every second...and keep sharing! Whoops, did we forget to mention, the couple also attended the French rugby ‘Oscars’, the Midi Olympique #OscarsMidol awards, which took place in Paris on Monday night? Congrats to Cheslin Kolbe, our Springbok right-wing who walked away with World Player of the Year title.</p>
