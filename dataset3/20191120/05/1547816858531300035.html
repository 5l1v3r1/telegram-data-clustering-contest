Asim Riaz and Sidharth Shukla fought as if they have been enemies for ages and threw some nasty words at each other. Now, with their fight, the house is divided between who is right and who is wrong.

      <p>Well, it is too bad that Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz had such an aggressive fight. It started over with Shehnaaz demanding fruits from Sidharth's team in Shehnaaz Ka Swayamvar task. While Sidharth wanted to get oranges for Shehnaaz as she demanded it, Asim wanted to take apples for her father played by Hindustani Bhau. One thing led to another and then everything fell apart for Asim and Sidharth.Â </p>
