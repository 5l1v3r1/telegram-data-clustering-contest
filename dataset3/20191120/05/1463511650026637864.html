      <h1>Sowore: UN must insist on freedom of expression, association – GA President</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:08:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:08</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The President of the General Assembly, Ambassador Tijjani Muhammad-Bande, says the United Nations must continue to insist on protection of the freedom of expression and association around the world.</p>
      <p>Muhammad-Bande stated this at an interactive session with representatives of civil society organisations at the UN headquarters in New York on Monday.</p>
      <p>He noted that there could be no democracy and peace if people were not allowed to freely associate and express themselves.</p>
      <p>He said: “The United Nations must continue to affirm freedom of association and freedom of expression regardless of location.</p>
      <p>“Without these we cannot have a democracy and peace. Therefore, the thing is for the UN to continue to join others in insisting that the rights of individuals be upheld.”</p>
      <p>In the same breath, the PGA noted that freedom of expression is not absolute, and urged citizens to exercise their rights with a sense of responsibility.</p>
      <p>However, he said authorities must subject themselves to judicial process in dealing with individuals who violate the law in the course of exercising their rights.</p>
      <p>He said: “That you are a journalist or a teacher does not mean you cannot do wrong.</p>
      <p>“But if someone violates the law, let the courts make a determination and let us respect the court.</p>
      <p>“There is also judicial process; let all of us submit ourselves to that process and let that process be fair.”</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the PGA was responding to a question that sought his plans on advancement of human rights with focus on freedom of the press.</p>
      <p>It came from the Secretary-General of the International Peace Research Association, Mort Myr, who said the association was concerned about the difficulties faced by journalists from authorities.</p>
      <p>Myr specifically mentioned the case of Omoyele Sowore, a prominent journalist, being held by the Federal Government on charges of treasonable felony and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Sowore, Publisher of Sahara Reporters, an online news medium, and presidential candidate in the February 2019 presidential election, was arrested by the Department of State Service on August 3.</p>
      <p>The arrest came two days before a planned nationwide protest, tagged: #RevolutionNow, which was to be led by him.</p>
      <p>The DSS still has him in custody even after meeting the conditions for a second bail granted him by a federal judge since October 4.</p>
