      <h1>Eden Hazard backs former club Chelsea to beat Manchester City this weekend</h1>
      <h2>Frank Lampard's young team travel to the champions on Saturday hoping to become the fourth side to beat them in the Premier League so far this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:41:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:41</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Eden Hazard believes Chelsea can further dent Manchester City's title hopes by beating them at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Blues are on a fantastic run of form, having won their last six Premier League games in a row, but they face a stern test when they face Pep Guardiola's side.</p>
      <p>Hazard, who left <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> over the summer, fancies his former team to do <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> a favour in the title race and boost their own chances of finishing in the top four.</p>
      <p>When asked by Sky Sports if he thinks Chelsea can beat City Hazard said: "Of course I think so. It's not going to be easy. It's hard to play there.</p>

      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"Last time we played them we lost 6-0, so bad memories for me and Chelsea. But I think this season they are really good. They are really young, but they are really good, so why not go there and win the game?</p>
      <p>"When I watch them, no Hazard but it's a party! They can score, they can score a lot of goals, the fans are happy, they are third in the league, so it's going to be a great season. They just need to stay there, win games and that's it."</p>
      <p>Hazard has had a mixed start to his Madrid career having struggled with injuries, and so far he has only scored two goals for the club, creating two assists.</p>

      <p>He managed to find the back of the net twice for Belgium in their recent Euro 2020 qualifier against Russia, however, and he will be hoping to take that form with him into the domestic season.</p>
      <p>Madrid host Real Sociedad on Saturday hoping to maintain their title push, with the Spanish giants currently level on 25 points with bitter rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> at the top of the table.</p>
