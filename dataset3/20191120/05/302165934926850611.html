      <p>KOTA BARU, Nov 20 ― The Kelantan police seized 186,000 Yaba pills weighing 20.781kg and 39.21kg of syabu, worth an estimated total of RM3.7 million in an operation on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Kelantan deputy police chief SAC Abdullah Muhammad Piah said the raid was carried out by a team from the Narcotics Divisions of the Pasir Mas District Police headquarters (IPD) after being tipped off by the public.</p>
      <p>Acting on the information, the team detained a couple aged 36 and 37 at a house in Lubuk Jong, Pasir Mas, at around 9am on Sunday, and found 97 Yaba pills at the premises.</p>
      <p>“The police were then led by the two suspects to a hotel room in Kota Baru at 11.30am the same day.</p>
      <p>During the raid on the hotel room, the police had to break open the door with the cooperation of the hotel operator, and arrested a 42-year-old man hiding in the bathroom,” he told reporters at the Kelantan police contingent headquarters here, today.</p>
      <p>Abdullah said inspections revealed a number of Eramin 5 pills in the pocket of the suspect's pants found on the bed.</p>
      <p>The suspect then led the police to a Lexus parked outside the hotel premises.</p>
      <p>“The police found four zipped bags and a package containing crystal-like substance and pills believed to be syabu and Yaba pills.</p>
      <p>Urine tests found the two men arrested in the case to be Methamphetamine-positive while the result for the female suspect came back negative. The two men work as an air-conditioner installer and car salesman respectively, while the woman is a salesperson,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said following the arrests, the police seized six luxury vehicles, watches of various brands, bags, cash, handsets, jewellery, land titles and account books worth a total of RM540,850.</p>
      <p>“The case will be investigated under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, while all suspects have been remanded for seven days, from November 18 to 24.</p>
      <p>“If convicted, they can be subjected to the mandatory death sentence,” he added. ― Bernama</p>
