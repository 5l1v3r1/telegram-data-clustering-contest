      <p>Forty-one individuals were arrested after a second-round qualifying football match between Malaysia and Indonesia last night at Kuala Lumpur’s Bukit Jalil National Stadium descended into chaos and violence.</p>
      <p>Security officials arrested 27 Malaysian fans and 14 from Indonesia, senior police official Mohamed Mokhsein Mohamed Zon told local media.</p>

      <p>In a match that saw Malaysia come out on top as part of the 2022 World Cup/2023 Asian Cup qualifier, celebrations were dampened by certain supporters from both sides, who engaged in violent acts both inside and outside the stadium.</p>
      <p>National news agency <i>Bernama</i> reported that individuals were found to be throwing bottles, traffic cones, and firecrackers at each other, with members of the Federal Reserve Team having to step in to control the violent crowds.</p>

      <p>Following Indonesia’s 2-0 defeat, the country’s fans were escorted out of the stadium in staggered groups, and under police protection.</p>
      <p>But last night’s violence paled in comparison to a September qualifier between the two nations, which ended in a 3-2 victory for Malaysia — and with bottles, flares, and other projectiles being hurled into the Malaysian fans’ stands by the Indonesian side.</p>

      <p>The melee was such that Malaysia’s sports minister, <a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/news/not-cool-bros-sports-minister-syed-saddiq-condemns-violence-at-malaysia-indonesia-world-cup-qualifier/">who was present at the match</a>, had to be evacuated from the stadium as the violence deepened and police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd outside.</p>
      <p>FIFA fined Indonesia’s national FA US$45,000 over the chaos, another blow for football in a country where the game has long been beset by problems.</p>
