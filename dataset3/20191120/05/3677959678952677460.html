      <p>[<b>Update</b>] As mentioned in our initial article, Rockstar advises to update to GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 441.34. This hotfix driver is based on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-game-ready-driver-44120-star-wars-jedi/">Game Ready Driver 441.20</a> and <a href="https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4930">can be downloaded through here</a>. We've included NVIDIA's release notes here:</p>

      <p>The PC version of Red Dead Redemption 2 was released last month, but since its launch, players have been plagued by stalling issues. Those using 4-core and 6-core CPU were required to disable some cores in order to be able to play the game properly. Luckily, this new update should resolve these issues for those using the Vulkan API. Rockstar notes that players using an NVIDIA GPU and a 4-core or 6-core CPU should update to GeForce Hotfix Driver Version 441.34 to fix the issues.</p>
      <p>In addition to addressing these stalling issues, the update also resolves various crashes.</p>
