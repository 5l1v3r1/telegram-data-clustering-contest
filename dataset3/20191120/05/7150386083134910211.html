      <p>Former world No. 1 Kidambi Srikanth and Sameer Verma led a positive start for India at the Korea Masters 2019 by progressing to the men’s singles second round in Gwangju on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Srikanth got the better of Hong Kong’s Wong Wing Ki Vincent 21-18 21-17 in 37 minutes. He thus extended his dominating head-to-head record against Vincent to 11-3.</p>
      <p>He now next faces Japan’s Kanta Tsuneyama in the second round on Thursday. Tsuneyama beat Lu Chia-Hung of Chinese Taipei 21-11, 21-10 in his opening round fixture.</p>
      <p>Sameer didn’t have to go the distance in his match as his opponent Kazumasa Sakai of Japan retired midway through the first game with the Indian leading 11-8.</p>
      <p>But it was curtains for Sourabh Verma who exited after losing to home favourite Kim Donghun. After losing the first game 13-21, the Indian made a strong comeback to draw level pocketing the next 21-12. However, Donghun, jolted by the second game, summoned his best to outclass Sourabh 21-13 and march ahead.</p>
      <p>Sameer will now face Donghun in the second round.</p>
