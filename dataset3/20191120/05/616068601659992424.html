      <p>Macleans has released its annual ranking of the most dangerous places in Canada and Penticton has made the top 20, pushed there by high property crime numbers. </p>
      <p>Based on Statistics Canada data, the Canadian news magazine features an interactive ranking tool that allows residents to see how their community ranks. Categories include everything from fraud to youth crime to impaired driving, and the data is pulled from the Crime Severity Index (CSI).</p>
      <p>The CSI includes all police-reported crime in 2018, which is the most recent year with data available.</p>
      <p>It should be noted, the CSI has been routinely <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/232271/city-ranked-19th-for-crime">criticized</a> by those in the policing community as an inaccurate tool when comparing mid-sized communities to larger cities. That said, it is one of the only crime metrics produced by Stats Canada that can be equally applied across the country.</p>
      <p>The Violent Crime Severity Index uses a number of metrics in order to determine a location’s ranking. The index is broken into four major categories: Homicide, Assault &amp; Bodily Harm; Theft &amp; Property Crime; Drug Offences; and Youth Crime. From there, each of the categories is broken down into subcategories.</p>
      <p>Penticton’s overall crime severity index climbed 1.15 per cent in 2018, while the violent crime index fell 20 per cent.</p>
      <p>Penticton’s ranking amongst 237 Canadian cities in each category is shown below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Violent crime: 104 (down from 42 in previous year)</li>
        <li>All crime: 19 (down from 17)</li>
        <li>Break and enters: 8</li>
        <li>Drunk driving: 18 </li>
        <li>Sex assault: 159</li>
        <li>Assault: 84</li>
        <li>Firearms: 44</li>
        <li>Robbery: 62</li>
        <li>Fraud: 51</li>
        <li>Homicide: 229</li>
        <li>Youth crime: 47</li>
      </ul>
