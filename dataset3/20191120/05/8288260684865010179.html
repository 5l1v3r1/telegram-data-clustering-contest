      <p>Four organ donors who gave the gift of life in the face of tragedy have been honoured posthumously – after they saved the lives of 14 people.</p>
      <p>Sean Sandford, from Kings Norton, Sally Lavender from Birmingham, Leslie Renwick from Wombourne and Michael Frost from Tile Cross have all been awarded the Order of St John Award for organ donation.</p>
      <p>Their families and loved ones were invited to receive the awards in a moving ceremony hosted by NHS Blood and Transplant and St John’s Ambulance.</p>
      <p>The awards recognised the 1,619 people who donated their organs after death last year, leading to thousands of patients’ lives being saved or transformed.</p>
      <p>Nicola and Alan Sandford collected the award on behalf on their son Sean, who died just weeks after being diagnosed with a brain tumour in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Talented rugby player Sean had shown virtually no symptoms apart from two episodes of illness that he put down to stress and travelling.</p>
      <p>But doctors believed that Sean, 29, had a grade 3 or 4 brain tumour and his parents learned he could have less than two years to live.</p>

      <p>Just weeks later in July, Sean suffered seizures in hospital, and was put on life support – but nothing could be done.</p>
      <p>His family decided to put Sean forward for organ donation, only possible because he had not started radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment as planned.</p>
      <p>Mum Nicola says: “When we had the meeting with the doctors I can remember saying ‘Something good has to come out of this horrific unimaginable situation we find ourselves in.</p>
      <p>“Can he be an organ donor with a brain tumour?’</p>
      <p>“Sean’s uncle Martin had also confirmed that they’d had a conversation about donation and we all felt this was the right thing to do.”</p>
      <p>Later, Nicola and Alan were informed that Sean had saved six lives. </p>
      <p>“We received a letter, cards and pictures from the teenage heart recipient,” Nicola says.  “He and his family were so grateful for their gift of life.</p>
      <p>“It was very upsetting and emotional to receive their letters but I am glad we did.</p>
      <p>“During the awards evening a nurse came to us who we had never met before. She said she had looked after Sean in critical care over the two nights. She told me later she had gone down to theatre with Sean and that gave me great comfort as she was obviously so caring.</p>
      <p>“We cannot have our son, brother, or daddy back but six other people are still living because of him.”</p>

      <p>Sally Lavender died at the age of 47 after suffering a major stroke caused by a bleed on the brain.</p>
      <p>Her partner of 10 years, Mark Parkes, accepted the award on her behalf after her liver and kidney saved two more lives.</p>
      <p>“Sally was rushed to the CCU at City Hospital where the nursing team were superb, but too much damage had been done and she died four days later,” says Mark.</p>
      <p>“We hadn’t talked about organ donation – it didn’t seem we would need to.</p>
      <p>“However, I had known Sally for a long time and I knew her ex-husband Martyn who confirmed that he and Sally had both registered as organ donors whilst at university.</p>
      <p>“Once I had this information I was sure I would respect Sally’s wishes.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Unfortunately while in hospital Sally had also suffered a heart attack, which meant her heart was not suitable for transplant.</p>
      <p>But her kidney was donated to a woman who had been on the waiting list for six years, and her liver went to a man in his 40s.</p>
      <p>She also donated tissues including heart valves which will be stored until a suitable match is found.</p>
      <p>“I was honoured to be invited to attend the ceremony and went with Martyn,” says Mark. “We have maintained our friendship throughout this sad time.</p>
      <p>“It was a lovely ceremony, very emotional, but all concerned looked after us with care, respect and sympathy. I have the certificate framed on a wall in the living room.”</p>

      <p>After the sudden death of her husband Leslie, Valerie Renwick decided agreed to donate his organs, saving three lives. </p>
      <p>“Organ donation was only something Leslie and I had discussed in passing,” she says. “He hadn’t joined the register but agreed with it in principle.</p>
      <p>“When Leslie died, however, it was very sudden. Even though I knew Leslie agreed with organ donation I still needed time to come to the right decision. </p>
      <p>“I took some time alone with Leslie and reflected back on our conversations. The organ donation staff were very compassionate and gave me time.</p>
      <p>“Leslie was a wonderful man, so loving and kind – and for these reasons I felt that organ donation was right for him.”</p>
      <p>Through his donation Leslie, who died at the age of 64, was able to help three people. He donated both of his kidneys and his liver. Valerie has received letters from all three recipients.</p>
      <p>“It was so comforting to hear from Leslie’s recipients,” she says. “It has helped me realise what an amazing gift organ donation is.</p>
      <p>“The recipients told me how much their lives have changed thanks to Leslie and how they can now enjoy spending time with their families. I am so proud of him.”</p>

      <p>Michael Frost, from Tile Cross died suddenly after contracting sepsis.</p>
      <p>His wife Carole, son Karl and daughter Stacey agreed for Michael to become an organ donor, saving three lives. </p>
      <p>“Dad’s death was very unexpected,” says Stacey. “When we were told nothing could be done, we discussed between ourselves if organ donation would be right for him.</p>
      <p>“We had never discussed directly with Dad but agreed if Dad could help others then we would be happy to go ahead.”</p>
      <p>Later, the family was comforted to learn to that Michael, who was 69, was already registered as a donor, and his liver and both kidneys were successfully donated in life-saving transplants. </p>

      <p>“We have since received a letter from one of his recipients which continues to give us strength in dealing with our loss,” adds Stacey.</p>
      <p>“Until we went through this journey, we honestly could not comprehend what was involved in organ donation and how imperative it is that people donate.</p>
      <p>“We are so proud of Dad and of how he has been able to help others. It brings us comfort and helps with our grief, and it was an honour to receive the award in his memory.”</p>
      <p>From spring 2020, the law around organ and tissue donation in England is changing.</p>
      <p>All adults in England will be considered as having agreed to donate their own organs when they die unless they record a decision not to donate or are in one of the excluded groups.</p>
