      <p>The phrases "grocery store" and "bitcoin robbery" don't usually go together, but that's the case here.</p>
      <p>Two masked men broke into Simply Delicious Food Market and ran off with cashÂ stolen from a bitcoin ATM. The robbery happened at about 4 a.m. Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Police were on the scene 15 minutes after the alarm was triggered, but just missed the thieves escaping. But there is some evidence to work with.</p>
      <p>"Our security camera caught at least one of their cars drive away, which was a grey Nissan Sentra," says store owner Troy Roland. "The police were also able to catch their license plate too."</p>
      <p>Roland says that Simply delicious won't keep the bitcoin ATM in the store after the robbery.</p>
      <p>The suspects didn't take anything else in the store, they headed straight for the ATM. Roland says it looked like they knew what they were doing, there was no hesitation on their part.</p>
      <p>The investigation is still ongoing and anyone with information can call Vernon North Okanagan RCMP at 250-545-7171. You can also contact Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 or on their <a href="https://www.nokscrimestoppers.com/">website</a>.</p>
