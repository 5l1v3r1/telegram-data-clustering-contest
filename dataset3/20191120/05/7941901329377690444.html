To help U.S. children quickly learn to code, readers of <i>Medium</i> learned this week, <a href="https://medium.com/@codeorg/new-hour-of-code-dance-party-features-new-artists-a-new-dancer-and-more-85eca9e31ce">Code.org and Amazon have engaged Lil Nas X and Katy Perry to be their Hour of Code tutors</a> this December (guess the pair aced their <a href="https://mashable.com/article/lil-nas-x-katy-perry-jeff-bezos/">interview with Jeff Bezos</a>!). Last year's signature Hour of Code tutorial <a href="https://code.org/dance"><i>Dance Party</i> </a>, Code.org explains, has been given a facelift -- "New backgrounds and foregrounds!" "New songs!" "A brand new character!" -- to yield this year's signature <a href="https://hourofcode.com/us/learn">Hour of Code</a> tutorial, <a href="https://code.org/dance"><i>Dance Party (2019 Remix)</i> </a>. Separately, the AWS Public Sector Blog Team just announced it's teamed up with the MIT Media Lab on a Scratch-based Hour of Code activity to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/teaching-the-next-generation-of-cloud-professionals-during-the-hour-of-code/">introduce AWS cloud computing technologies to kids 7 and up</a>. AWS Educate also recently announced it's out to <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/first-connects-k12-students-to-cloud-services-for-robotics-competitions-through-aws-educate/">connect the K12 crowd to AWS cloud services</a>, offering free capped AWS Educate Starter Accounts as well as look-Ma-no-limit credit-card backed regular AWS accounts to the 570,000+ students and 300,000+ volunteers participating in the FIRST Robotics Competition and FIRST Tech Challenge.</i></p>
