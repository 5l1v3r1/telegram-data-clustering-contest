      <p>Bunge FC manager, Venance Mwamoto, disclosed in Dodoma last weekend the squad will go for intensive training in an effort to live up to expectations.</p>
      <p>The squad was among outfits which battled it out in games, which were organized by Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children, and took place in the region last week.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister, Kassim Majaliwa, graced the games’ closing ceremony.</p>
      <p>The competition geared towards motivating Members Parliament and other government employees to cherish healthy lifestyle.</p>
      <p>In soccer, Bunge FC drew 1-1 with Watumishi FC, a team made up of employees of The President's Office, Public Service Management and Good Governance.</p>
      <p>It was an entertaining duel, given both teams displayed impressive showing.</p>
      <p>Mwamoto said Bunge FC missed the services of five strikers that include Mwigulu Nchemba and others, who are nursing injuries.</p>
      <p>The players’ absence made it difficult for Bunge FC to register goals.</p>
      <p>He disclosed he is optimistic the players will regain fitness before the next month’s East Africa Inter-Parliamentary Games</p>
      <p>"We chose to rest several players including Charles Tizeba in the second stanza in an effort to boost our defense,” he disclosed.</p>
      <p>Mwamoto pointed out the defenders had to work harder, particularly in the second stanza, as they had to occasionally push upfront to improve the squad’s pursuit of goals.</p>
      <p>He added Uganda have twice won the soccer event in the East Africa Inter-Parliamentary Games.</p>
      <p>He however maintained Uganda will this year not win the event’s trophy, given Bunge FC have already spotted weaknesses, which are evident in the hosts and other opponents, Kenya, Rwanda, and Burundi, and will fully exploit the flaws to post wins.</p>
      <p>He said Bunge FC’s wins in friendly games against Dodoma Veterans and Mazengo Warriors, which were recently held in Dodoma, reflect the team’s intention to excel in the East Africa Inter-Parliamentary Games.</p>
      <p>Bunge FC cruised to 2-0 victory over Dodoma Veterans and later on came out with 1-0 win against Mazengo Warriors, with Jamhuri Stadium hosting both matches.</p>
      <p>"Our squad is training well, we put emphasis on discipline in and outside the venue, we will hopefully camp after the local government election,” he noted.</p>
      <p>“We will arrange two friendly games before jetting out to Kampala, one will take place in Mwanza and the other will take place in Zanzibar.”</p>
