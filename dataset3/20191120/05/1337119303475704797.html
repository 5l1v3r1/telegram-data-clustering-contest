      <p>Smart speakers are always a popular choice for gifts: you can use them to play music, tell you the weather, and even order packages. If you’ve been holding out for even cheaper prices, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> deals are on the way. But in the same way that there are so many different types of smart speakers, there are also so many different deals on smart speakers. Whether you prefer Amazon or Google, you can find deals on speakers of all sizes and price points during Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Here’s a list of all of the smart speaker deals we know about so far, organized by brand. We’ll keep this list updated as prices drop further, and as sales come and go.</p>
