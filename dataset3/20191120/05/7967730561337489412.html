      <h1>Duncan a Cat for life as Rohan extends contract</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:47:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:47</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Ryan, Scott Spits and Michael Gleeson</a></address>
      <p>Geelong have moved to secure some of their experienced players, locking down midfielder Mitch Duncan until the end of 2024 while signing forward Gary Rohan to a one-year contract extension.</p>
      <p>Duncan's long-term deal virtually makes him a Cat for life, with the durable 28-year-old to turn 33 midway through the final season of his contract.</p>

      <p>He was due to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of 2020, but the four-year extension takes him off the free agency market, which will include several quality midfielders such as the Giants' Lachie Whitfield and Adelaide's Brad Crouch.</p>
      <p>Since arriving from East Perth via the 2009 national draft, Duncan has played 203 games and was part of Geelong's 2011 premiership team. His knee injury in this year's qualifying final cost the Cats as he missed the semi and preliminary finals.</p>
      <p>Geelong football manager Simon Lloyd said Duncan was a quality Geelong player and person.</p>
      <p>"Mitch has been a mainstay of our team over 10 seasons, a dependable, intelligent teammate and a quality player," Lloyd said.</p>
      <p>"Our members and supporters have watched Mitch's career unfold and we all look forward to it continuing over the next five seasons."</p>
      <p>Rohan, who joined the Cats this season after nine years with the Sydney Swans, extended his deal with Geelong until 2021.</p>

      <p>Lloyd praised Rohan's contribution, with the 28-year-old kicking 20 goals in the first nine rounds before injury and form reduced his output.</p>

      <p>"Gary was able to enjoy a strong start to his career in Geelong colours at the beginning of the season. He made a smooth transition into our team and was an energetic addition to the group both on and off the field," Lloyd said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Hawthorn engaged in a pick swap with North Melbourne to secure a future second-round pick as well as picks 50 and 73 in exchange for pick 30 in this year's national draft.</p>
      <p>Gaining a future second-round pick makes it possible for the Hawks to trade out their future first-round pick either this year or in 2020. The swap gives the Kangaroos three picks between 26 and 30 in this year's draft, with the capacity to attempt to move higher up the order.</p>
