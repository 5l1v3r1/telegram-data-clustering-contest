      <h1>The ABC Just Published, Then Swiftly Deleted, A Line About Epstein Not Killing Himself</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:23:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:23</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>We preface this article by stating very clearly: We’re not even remotely sure what’s going on here. We’ve tried wrapping our heads around it. We’ve tried investigating it. We’ve tried approaching it from different angles. Nothing about it makes a lick of sense. Each and every stitch of this story is more confusing than the last. The best we can say at this, and probably any stage, is that one of three things has occurred:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The ABC has published the line “Epstein didn’t kill himself” by flagrant mistake.</li>
        <li>The ABC has been suckered in by someone having a red-hot lend of them.</li>
        <li>The Victorian Liberal party is field testing edge lord memes in official documentation as a weapon of political distraction.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>None of those outcomes really pass the sniff test. And yet, at least one of them has caused this.</p>
      <p>A brief brouhaha has broken out among media circles after an ABC article covering a new report into just how badly the Victorian Liberal Party cooked their most recent State Election campaign was derailed by the deeply strange appearance of an Epstein joke.</p>
      <p>The report itself, conducted by Vic Liberal elder statesman <b>Tony Nutt </b>(real name), reportedly minces few words in its assessment of the Liberals’ efforts in the campaign that saw them, and then-party leader <b>Matthew Guy</b>, handed an almighty thrashing by Premier <b>Daniel Andrews </b>and the incumbent Labor Party. Chief among the findings was that the Victorian public simply did not buy the “African gangs” moral panic the Liberal Party tried to stir up, which is wild when you consider a major political party thought the people would simply eat up overt racism sight unseen.</p>
      <p>Either way, the resultant ABC article rounded itself off with this barnburner.</p>

      <p>That line stayed up for around 30 minutes or so before it was removed, but that was more than enough time for a collective yelp of “<i>huh??</i>” to be belted from the heavens.</p>
      <p>What to make of that? What to think? What to <i>do</i>?</p>

      <p>For whatever it’s worth, the journalist behind the report, the ABC’s <b>Richard Williamson</b>, asserts the comment was indeed from an unidentified “senior Liberal” who was not terribly stoked on the contents of the Nutt Report.</p>

      <p><b>PEDESTRIAN.TV </b>has made attempts to reach out to Nutt for clarification, though we’re not exactly holding our breath for any clarity in the response. We’re not really holding our breath for a response at all, to be honest.</p>
      <p>So what’s really gone on here? Did the ABC get suckered into publishing something they shouldn’t have? Or is the Victorian Liberal Party Discord chat slowly descending into some fairly iffy territory? Hard to say.</p>
      <p>Of course, there’s always the possibility it’s just some VicLib boffin trying desperately to be funny in the media because he or she is pissy about their party’s attempts to get the public all het up over a made-up immigrant threat were about as effective as a security camera in a Manhattan jail.</p>
      <p>But what idiot has the time for that?</p>
