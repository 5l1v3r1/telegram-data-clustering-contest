      <h1>Xiaomi’s insane 100W fast charging is coming to a smartphone next year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:41:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>Xiaomi’s <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/03/28/xiaomi-100w-super-charge-turbo/">Super Charge Turbo</a> technology is expected to be introduced on a new smartphone sometime next year. The insane 100W fast wired charging technology was teased earlier several months back and it could fully charge a 4,000mAh smartphone in just 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>During Xiaomi’s Developer Conference, the Chinese smartphone maker has dropped more details for its fast charging technology. The charger will feature a high-voltage charge pump and the supported device will utilise a double-cell battery architecture.</p>

      <p>For greater safety, it comes with 9-layers of protection – 7 layers on the board and 2 layers on the battery. The charging is also controlled by an independent MCU and it utilises a MTW battery structure which reduces temperatures and internal resistance, in order to increase the charging rate. What’s interesting is that it also features a wired and wireless fusion architecture, but it isn’t clear if that means you can charge using both wired and wireless methods at the same time.</p>

      <p>With Super Charge Turbo, you can get as much as 60% charge with just a quick 8-minute charge and a full charge can be done in just 17 minutes on the cable. At the moment, the fastest charging tech is Oppo’s <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/09/18/oppo-supervooc-65w-vooc-wireless-charging/">Super VOOC 2.0</a> which can charge from 0-27% in 5 minutes and a full charge in just 30 minutes. It is now available with the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/13/oppo-reno-ace-gundam-edition-limited/">Oppo Reno Ace</a>, which is a flagship device that features a fluid 90Hz AMOLED display.</p>
