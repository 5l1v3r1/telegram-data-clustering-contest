      <p>Famitsu has released some Japanese sales data on <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2019/11/18/uk-charts-sword-shield-had-second-biggest-launch-for-pokemon-games-in-uk-history/">Pokemon Sword and Shield</a>, as well as the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. The former is for the new generation of Pokemon’s first 3 days of availability, between November 15th and November 17th. The latter applies to the time period between November 11th and November 17th. Firstly, is Pokemon Sword and Shield, which managed to sell 1,364,544 copies in its first 3 days. According to Gematsu, “this number includes physical game copies, download cards, and the Pokemon Sword and Shield Double Pack, but does not include digital sales”. This means that Pokemon Sword and Shield is now Japan’s best selling opening week for a Switch title. Previously, this belonged to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.</p>
      <p>Secondly, 180,136 <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/?s=Nintendo+Switch">Switch</a> consoles, including Switch Lite, were sold. Gematsu says that this is “around the same boost hardware sales received when Pokemon: Let’s Go, Pikachu! and Pokemon: Let’s Go, Eevee! launched, but nearly 100,000 units less than the boost from when Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched”. Japanese Switch sales overall, as of this past week, have now surpassed 10,000,000.</p>
