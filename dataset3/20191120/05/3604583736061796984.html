      <h1>Code Red alert a first as Victoria braces for horrible fire day</h1>

      <p>THE CFA has issued a code red alert for parts of Victoria as the state braces for the first Total Fire Ban Day of the season.</p>
      <p>Ballarat is headed for a windy top of 36 degrees on Thursday but parts of the state will bake with Mildura expecting a second consecutive day above 40 degrees.</p>
      <p>A Code Red day signals the worst possible grass and bushfire conditions and the safest place to be is away from high risk fire areas within those districts.</p>
      <p>Both the Mallee and Northern Country areas, which takes in areas including Bendigo are listed as a Code Red for Thursday.</p>
      <p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said if a fire starts in the conditions predicted it will be "uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast moving with a high likelihood that people in the path of a fire will be killed or seriously injured in these conditions".</p>
      <p>Mr Crisp said Victoria had not experienced a Code Red Day previously and this needed to be taken seriously.</p>
      <p>"Our message to the community in these areas is that leaving high bushfire risk areas tonight or early tomorrow morning is the safest option," he said.</p>
      <p>"We know this can be difficult to plan for and some will find it inconvenient. As a result of the predicted conditions, some schools and early childhood centres will be closed in some weather districts and community services may not be available.</p>
      <p>"Your plans need to suit your circumstances, however going to your nearest regional city centre, going to the movies, the pool, or a shopping centre are some options people can consider."</p>
      <p>The scorcher is only expected to be short lived with a cool change coming overnight Thursday into Friday and tops of just 20 degrees expected for both Friday and Saturday, although both days will be sunny.</p>
