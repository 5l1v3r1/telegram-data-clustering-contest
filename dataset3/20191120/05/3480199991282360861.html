      <p>Harry Styles has unveiled the tracklist for his eagerly awaited new album.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old former One Direction star has given fans a glimpse of his second solo record, Fine Line, which is set to be released next month.</p>
      <p>In a nod to LPs and cassette tapes, the track list is divided into side A, side B, side C and side D.</p>

      <p>It opens with Golden, Watermelon Sugar, Adore You, and Lights Up, which Styles announced as the album’s first single when he released the song alongside a steamy music video in October.</p>
      <p>Side B contains the songs Cherry, Falling, To Be So Lonely, and She. Side C is home to Sunflower, Vol. 6, Canyon Moon and Treat People With Kindness.</p>
      <p>Title track Fine Line is alone on side D.</p>
      <p>Styles plans to take the album on a world tour, called Love On Tour, next year.</p>
      <p>After frenzied demand for tickets, the pop star added five dates to the North American leg.</p>
      <p>Fine Line is Styles’s follow-up to his self-titled 2017 debut. It is set to be released on December 13.</p>
