      <p>Last April at the 2019 New York Auto Show, Lincoln unveiled its latest premium crossover, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lincoln/corsair">Corsair</a>. Replacing the MKC, the Corsair is the smallest of Lincoln's SUV and crossover lineup, consisting of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lincoln/nautilus">Nautilus</a>, <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lincoln/aviator">Aviator</a>, and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/lincoln/navigator">Navigator</a>. And now the luxury brand has unveiled its all-new Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring plug-in hybrid at this year's 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. For buyers who desire a PHEV option, your wish has been granted.</p>
      <p>Power comes from a specially engineered 2.5-liter Atkinson-cycle four-cylinder gasoline engine and a permanent magnet synchronous motor with a combined output of 266 horsepower, a figure Lincoln claims is based on its own calculations using computer engineering simulations. The combination of hybrid technology with a permanent all-wheel-drive system will deliver an all-electric range of over 25 miles.</p>
      <p>Power is directed to all four wheels through a PowerSplit electric CVT. The Corsair Grand Touring is also the first Lincoln to feature electric all-wheel drive. This new system powers the rear wheels and provides performance and capability in situations where power to all four wheels is required.</p>

      <p>There are five driving modes, Normal, Conserve, Excite, Slippery, and Deep Conditions, as well as another two modes specifically designated for "enhanced driving." Preserve EV recharges and saves battery power while continuing to use both the engine and electric motor to deliver top levels of performance. In fact, the high-voltage battery can be recharged up to 75 percent when this mode is selected. There's also Pure EV, intended to remain in all-electric mode in numerous conditions. If demand exceeds electric capability, the hybrid engine will automatically take over.</p>
      <p>Another benefit to the Corsair's electrified powertrain is a quiet interior, which is further improved with sound-dampening materials. Active Noise Control does its part by enhancing overall sound quality via strategically placed microphones throughout the cabin capable of finding specific frequencies and tuning them out. The Corsair Grand Touring offers sliding second-row seats and a 60/40 fold-flat or split-bench option. Although its battery is located under the floor, Lincoln still managed to maximize luggage space and legroom.</p>

      <p>Exterior styling is nearly identical to the non-PHEV Corsair, exceptions being a unique grille with the Lincoln star emblem in Spirit Blue, unique badging, and 20-inch wheels. Standard tech features include the Lincoln Co-Pilot 360 safety suite that includes Pre-Collision Assist with automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, rearview camera, and auto high beam headlights. The optional Co-Pilot 360 Plus adds adaptive cruise control with traffic jam assist, evasive steering assist, and active park assist plus.</p>
      <p>The Lincoln Corsair Grand Touring will be built in Louisville, Kentucky and sales will get underway next summer. Pricing will be announced closer to that time.</p>
