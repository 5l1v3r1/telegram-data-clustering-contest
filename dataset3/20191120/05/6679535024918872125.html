      <p>Equity benchmark BSE Sensex opened over 260 points higher on November 20, propelled by a rally in index-heavyweight Reliance Industries which scaled a fresh intra-day peak in opening session.</p>

      <p>Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL) rallied nearly 4% to hit their lifetime high of ₹1,571 (intra-day), inching closer to the ₹10 lakh crore market-capitalisation level.</p>
      <p>Reliance Jio on November 19 said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules, as it followed similar announcements by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on tariff hike.</p>

      <p>Foreign institutional investors offloaded shares worth ₹915.37 crore in the capital market in the previous session, while domestic institutional investors purchased equities worth ₹262.35 crore, data available with stock exchange showed.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo were trading in the red after U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday warned that failure to get a trade deal with China will prompt more tariffs. Stocks on Wall Street ended on a mixed note on November 19.</p>
