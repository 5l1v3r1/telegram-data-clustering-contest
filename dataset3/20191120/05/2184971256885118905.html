      <p>Twenty-five migrants have been found in a refrigerated container on a ferry that was heading to Felixstowe from the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The Britannia Seaways ship returned to the port of Vlaardingen, near Rotterdam, after the stowaways were discovered.</p>
      <p>Gert Jakobsen, vice president of communications with the ship's operator DFDS, said the migrants were found after they made a hole in the trailer.</p>
      <p>The roll on, roll off ferry was not far off the Dutch coast en route to the Suffolk town when the discovery was made at around 5pm on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Mr Jakobsen said police were waiting at the port and the migrants were taken to hospital by ambulance to check for hypothermia.</p>
      <p>"We don't know about the checks. Of course, they were not in a very good condition" he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"Unfortunately this is not the first time we have had such a situation. Of course, it's rare they hide in a refrigerated trailer. "But we do find migrants even though we try to prevent it."<cite>â€“ Gert Jakobsen, DFDS</cite></blockquote>
      <p>It is not known the ages or sex of any of the migrants or where they are from.</p>
      <p>Dutch police said 23 people were transferred to a police station after medical check-ups, while two were receiving extra care in hospital.</p>
      <p>Dogs are searching for other migrants were still on the ship.</p>
      <p>It comes weeks after the bodies of 39 Vietnamese migrants were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex after arriving on a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <p>And yesterday, eight people were found in the back of a lorry on the A14 in Cambridgeshire and a man was arrested on suspicion of assisting unlawful immigration.</p>
