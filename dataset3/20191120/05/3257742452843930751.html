      <p>Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-premieres-servant-coming-to-apple-tv-plus-november-28/">premiered</a> "Servant" at BAM Howard Gilman Opera House in Brooklyn, N.Y., today, the company said in a press release. <br/><br/>Like other marquee series, including "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/The+Morning+Show">The Morning Show</a>," "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/see">See</a>" and "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/for+all+mankind">For All Mankind</a>," the upcoming "Servant" will follow a weekly release schedule following a debut on Nov. 28, Thanksgiving Day in the U.S. The remaining seven episodes of the limited series will air every Friday. <br/><br/>Directed by Academy Award nominee M. Night Shyamalan, "Servant" follows a Philadelphia couple in mourning after a tragedy leads to a troubled marriage and "opens the door for a mysterious force to enter their home." Tony Basgallop, a British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated executive producer and writer, created the series. <br/><br/>After the release of an initial slate of shows, Apple has turned its attention to the promotion of "Servant," the first major show to launch on Apple TV+ since the service <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/01/apple-tv-launches-with-original-series-and-movies">debuted on Nov. 1</a>. Over the past three weeks, the company pushed out four teaser trailers for the show. The most recent takes a <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/13/construction-of-baby-doll-jericho-teased-in-latest-servant-trailer">closer look at "Jericho"</a>, a lifelike baby doll that appears to play a central role in the thriller's storyline. <br/><br/>Reports in early November indicate Apple TV+ is <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/apple-tv-reportedly-attracts-millions-of-users-in-first-week-as-apple-renews-four-shows">off to a solid start</a>, with "millions" of users activating accounts to watch Apple's original series, shows and movies. While an exact figure has yet to be announced, executives are said to be "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/19/initial-the-morning-show-reviews-were-attack-on-apple-executive-producers-say">very happy</a>" with early engagement metrics.<br/><br/>Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month, but customers who purchased an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iphone">iPhone</a>, <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/ipad">iPad</a>, iPod touch or <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/mac">Mac</a> after Sept. 10 are eligible for a free one-year subscription as part of a limited time promotional offer.</p>
