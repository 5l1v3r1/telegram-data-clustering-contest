With the amendments, the prescribed ceiling of aggregate chit fund amount for individuals would be raised to ₹3 lakh from ₹1 lakh. The Bill was introduced by Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur.</p>
      <h3>Here are the live updates:</h3>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 7.15 p.m.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha is adjourned for the day.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 6.10 p.m.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha passes the Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill, 2019.</p>
      <p>Zero hour commences.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 6.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha adjourned till 11.00 a.m., November 21, 2019.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 6.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Venkaiah Naidu takes the Chair.</p>
      <p>Karnataka MP Dr. Lankappa Hanumanthaiah of the INC, says that the Bill is not at par with the contemporary global discourse on trangender rights, sexual orientation and gender identity. He says that the category 'other' for transgenders is not inclusive. Only in the 2011 census they were recognised as the 'third gender'.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 5.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Anurag Singh Thakur, Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs says that the government plans to set up an online database for chit funds under the Chit Funds Bill to safeguard the subscribers's money.</p>
      <p>Responding to Amar Singh's argument for the need of formal financial systems for thepoor, Mr. Thakur says that under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana a large chunk of the population has been integrated into the banking system. He also mentions the growth of UPI payments, digital transactions and RuPay debit cards under the BJP government.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 5.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Jaya Bachchan (Samajwadi Party), from Uttar Pradesh, says that it is humiliating for the transgender community to have to prove their identity for obtaining a certificate. This in itself is segregation. The Bill has not addressed many technicalities like this and needs to be dealt with sensitively, she says.</p>
      <p>Odisha MP Sasmit Patra of the Biju Janata Dal, agrees with Mrs. Bachchan and adds that in addition to a National Council for Transgenders, there should be State Councils too as many people from the community do not have the resources to approach the council at a national level.</p>
      <p>He also says that the Code of Criminal Procedure is only discussed in terms of 'man' and 'woman'. Transgenders and their legal definition needs to be included in the code, he says.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha  | 5.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Amar Singh (INC) from Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab says that there is a need to absorb the poorer sections of the society and local chit funds into the organised banking system. This requires a high level of transparency and formalisation. The proposed Chit Funds Bill misses out on these provisions, he says.</p>
      <p>Congress Leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury from Berhampore, West Bengal, says that we do not have any dearth of legislations. But fraudulent elements continue to deceive the poor and less privileged with impunity. The Bill should provide a robust system for punishment, he says.  </p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 4.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>BJP MP from Rajasthan Ram Kumar Verma is speaking about the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019. He says that the Bill is comprehensive and urges the Parliament to pass it without further delay.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 4.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Ajay Bhatt of the BJP, from Nainital-Udhamsingh Nagar, extends his support for the Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill and says that the proposed changes will bring in more transparency and accountability.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 3.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Lok Sabha is discussing the Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 2.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Dr. Amee Yajnik (INC) asks what is in place to safeguard the rights of the woman who undergoes surrogacy and the child who is born. She also says that the term "close relative" is not defined in the Bill.</p>
      <p>If infertility is discovered by the couple, why should they wait for five years, she asks. And then they need two certificates, she says. In this setup, if we have to rush to authorities, it has be made simple. How are you going to cross-check how many pregnancies a woman has undergone, asks Dr. Yajnik.</p>
      <p>TDP supports the Bill.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 2 p.m.</p>

      <p>Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD) says that the morality and ethics of surrogacy must be jettisoned, and the medical requirements should come first. What about same sex couples? it does not talk about that. Live-in relationships? This Bill looks only at married couples.</p>
      <p>Sushil Kumar Gupta (AAP) says that live-in relationships are not being considered for this Bill.</p>
      <p>Vikas Mahatme (BJP) says he supports the Bill.</p>
