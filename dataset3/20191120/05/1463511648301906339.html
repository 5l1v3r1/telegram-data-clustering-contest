      <p>“YCee vs Zaheer,” the latest album of singer and rapper, Oludemilade Alejo, aka YCee, has been streamed over two million times.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria reports that YCee excitedly shared the news on his instagram page: @iam_ycee.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited debut album, entitled: “Ycee vs Zaheer,” was released on November 8 and has steadily become a fan favourite in the last couple of days.</p>
      <p>The project comes as a follow up to his eight-track body of work “First Wave” (2017) and “Late Night Vibrations” in 2018.</p>
      <p>The two-dimensional album featured collaborations with Davido, Phyno and Niniola.</p>
      <p>Among the songs contained in the 15-track project are Its Amazing, Wahala Dey, Bossing, Chocolata, Cheque and Dakun.</p>
      <p>Others are Vibing, Mo Salah, So Nice, Mine, Love Like That, Bassline, Dada and Vacancy.</p>
      <p>The album also had Ycee engage a squad of fiery producers, including Adey, JayBidz, Ballertosh, Fanatix and BeatsbyKarma.</p>
      <p>He also worked with Syn X, Krizbeatz, Jay Popping, Buzzin Producer, AP Da Don, TwoSeven, Elmore and KO.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the idea behind the album’s title, the Headies-nominated singer had said that his choice of “Ycee vs Zaheer” was a deliberate attempt to display his singing (Ycee) and rapping (Zaheer) side.</p>
      <p>YCee rose to limelight after his single “Condo”, which features vocals from Patoranking, earned him two nominations at the 2015 Nigeria Entertainment Awards.</p>
      <p>He was also nominated for Best Artist in African Pop at the 2015 All Africa Music Awards.</p>
      <p>In October 2016, Ycee signed a record deal with Sony Music, but terminated his contract with the label in February 2018. </p>
