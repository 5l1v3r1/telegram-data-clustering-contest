      <p>Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick as already-qualified Germany came from a goal down to crush Northern Ireland 6-1 in their final Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday and finish top of Group C.</p>
      <p>FRANKFURT, Germany: Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick as already-qualified Germany came from a goal down to crush Northern Ireland 6-1 in their final Euro 2020 qualifier on Tuesday and finish top of Group C.</p>
      <p>Gnabry cancelled out Michael Smith's eighth-minute shock lead with a fine turn and shot in the 19th minute. He then drilled in their third straight after the restart following Leon Goretzka's 43rd minute goal that had put the Germans ahead.</p>

      <p>The 24-year-old winger then completed his hat-trick on the hour to take his tally to an impressive 13 goals in 13 internationals before Goretzka fired in from 20 metres to crown his own fine performance.</p>
      <p>Julian Brandt completed the rout in stoppage time and the Germans, who had already made sure of their spot in next year's tournament with Saturday's 4-0 win over Belarus, finished on 21 points, two ahead of second-placed Netherlands.</p>
