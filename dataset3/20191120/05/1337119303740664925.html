      <h1>Vizio TV owners will be able to stream Disney+ over Chromecast in December</h1>
      <h2>Right now, you otherwise have to rely on AirPlay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:18:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>Right now, if you want to watch Disney+ on a Vizio SmartCast TV, you can only do so by sending it to the TV from an Apple device with AirPlay. That will change soon, though, as <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vizio-supports-disney-streaming-through-apple-airplay-and-soon-over-chromecast-built-in-starting-early-december-300960571.html">Vizio announced today</a> that it will be rolling out a SmartCast TV update in early December that will also let you cast Disney+ to your TV with Chromecast, a feature that’s built into the company’s recent TVs.</p>
      <p>If you don’t have an Apple device, it might be frustrating that you’ll have to wait until next month before you can catch up on <i>The Mandalorian</i> on your SmartCast TV. Of course, you might already have a game console or something else plugged into your TV that offers Disney+ right now. But once the update lands, it’ll get a little simpler. It’d be even better if Vizio would add Disney+ as a built-in app, but that doesn’t seem to be in the cards just yet.</p>
