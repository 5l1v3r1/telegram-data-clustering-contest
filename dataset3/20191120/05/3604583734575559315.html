      <h1>Code Red fire warning for Victoria</h1>

      <p>Victoria is facing a Code Red fire danger rating on Thursday - the first warning of its type in almost a decade.</p>
      <p>Mallee and Northern Country districts have both been labelled as Code Red - the highest warning level.</p>
      <p>Emergency Management commissioner Andrew Crisp said if a fire started in the conditions predicted it would be uncontrollable, unpredictable and fast-moving.</p>
      <p>He said fire agencies would find these fires difficult to control.</p>
      <p>There is a high likelihood that people in the path of a fire will be killed or seriously injured in these conditions.</p>
      <p>The warning also means some schools and services will be closed.</p>
      <p>Mr Crisp said a Code Red day was determined because a combination of high temperatures overnight, little relief followed up with predicted high temperatures and high wind speeds on Thursday.</p>
      <p>There is a statewide total fire ban for Thursday.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mr Crisp said the state had not experienced a Code Red day under the current framework, and it needed to be taken seriously.</p>
      <p>"Our message to community members in these areas is that leaving high bushfire risk areas tonight or early tomorrow morning is the safest option," he said.</p>
      <p>"We know this can be difficult to plan for and some will find it inconvenient.</p>
      <p>"As a result of the predicted conditions, some schools and early childhood centres will be closed in some weather districts and community services may not be available.</p>
      <p>"Your plans need to suit your circumstances, however going to your nearest regional city centre, going to the movies, the pool, or a shopping centre are some options people can consider."</p>
      <p>Mr Crisp said it was already hot and people needed to ensure they were looking after themselves and others, particularly those who need additional assistance in the heat.</p>
      <p>"Our community members should be prepared for fire, and know where to get information to make good decisions about your safety," he said.</p>
      <p>"Given fires could start and move quickly, you won't always receive a warning or be told what to do if a fire starts. The fire agencies advise you not to wait and see, it's up to you to be prepared and to know what you will do.</p>
      <p>"The safest place to be is away from high risk bushfire areas in a Code Red and leaving the night before or early in the day is the safest option."</p>
      <p>A Code Red day means that all public parks will be closed, some community services will be unavailable and some council facilities will be closed.</p>
      <p>During extreme weather, such as a Code Red day, localised power blackouts could occur.</p>
      <p>People are urged to have an emergency kit ready, including medication, battery-operated torches, radio and phones.</p>
      <p>The Emergency Management commissioner said people should:</p>
      <p>Country Fire Authority chief officer Steve Warrington said Victoria's fire agencies and emergency managers were on high alert and prepared for the worst conditions.</p>
      <p>"Tomorrow's conditions will be extremely difficult for firefighters and the community if we get fires running," he said.</p>
      <p>"The reality is fires are incredibly difficult to control and there are many aspects our communities need to consider in planning for it.</p>
      <p>"Homes are not built to withstand the types of fires we may see on a Code Red day and you don't want to be caught travelling through areas on fire at the last minute if you wait and see."</p>
      <h3>How is the fire danger rating determined?</h3>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology forecasts other fire danger ratings based on weather conditions and fuel load.</p>
      <p>However, a Code Red Day is determined by the Emergency Management commissioner. The commissioner takes into consideration a range of factors including fire dander ratings, fuel conditions, agricultural activity, fires already burning, uncontrolled ignitions, community risk, population movement and major events.</p>
      <p>The commissioner makes this determination through consultation with emergency management heads including fire, health, police, transport and energy representatives.</p>
      <p>The Code Red Day determination is linked strongly to Bureau of Meteorology forecasts of extreme fire danger rating in either grassland or forest.</p>
      <p>This is the first time a Code Red Day has been determined by the Emergency Management Commissioner under these arrangements.</p>
