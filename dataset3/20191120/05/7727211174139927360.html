      <h1>Everton, West Ham and the starlet who got away in hunt for Seamus Coleman's right-back heir</h1>
      <h2>Everton identified a long-term replacement for fan-favourite Coleman but failed to sign him</h2>

        <i>Everton were thinking about Seamus Coleman's long-term successor three years ago - yet it remains on the agenda .</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Then, as they are now, the Blues are looking to find a player who will, ultimately, take over at right-back from the club captain.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Coleman had Jonjoe Kenny breathing down his neck last season and currently finds his place in the team taken by the on-loan Djibril Sidibe.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>But had the January transfer window panned out differently in 2016, then the heir to the throne could already have been found.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Everton had a bid, for an initial £3m, accepted for Leeds United's Sam Byram but after talks with the club, the young defender opted to join West Ham instead.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>On Saturday, Byram is expected at Goodison as part of the Norwich City squad he joined in the summer, and here is our explainer from the time as to why Roberto Martinez missed out on the sought-after full-back.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Sam Byram had decided his future - and it was not at Everton.</p>
      <p>After having a bid accepted by Leeds United and then holding talks with the young defender, the Blues waited for his answer.</p>
      <p>But Roberto Martinez, even then, knew that Everton were far from in pole position to sign the 22-year-old full-back.</p>
      <p>West Ham were rivals for Byram’s signature and were hoping to tip the balance in their favour with the promise of immediate first-team football.</p>
      <p>It did the trick as it emerged, in January 2016, that Byram had opted to accept the Hammers’ offer despite being keen to work with Martinez.</p>
      <p>The issue for the talented defender was that he wasn’t going to go straight into the team at Goodison. He was one for the future and would have to bide his time behind first-choice Seamus Coleman, be patient and prove himself at Premier League level.</p>

      <p>Martinez wasn’t willing to make such promises and was always up front and forthright with a player he believed had the potential to do great things.</p>
      <p>Byram had made 143 appearances and scored 10 goals for Leeds but he remained, much like Coleman was, rough round the edges and in need to time to adapt and grow at the highest, uncompromising level of Premier League football.</p>
      <p>But under the guidance of a manager proven in developing young players and known for expertly pacing their careers, it was hoped Byram would see Everton as the perfect place to be.</p>
      <p>But he wanted to play, and he wanted to play now, so he chose West Ham, where there was no Coleman shaped obstacle in his way.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>, who did all they could to get the deal done, respected his thinking after making the decision for footballing reasons.</p>
      <p>Byram and the Blues, who looked a natural fit, eventually went their separate ways with no hard feelings.</p>
