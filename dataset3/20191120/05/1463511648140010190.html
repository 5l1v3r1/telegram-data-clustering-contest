      <p>Alhaji Umar Pariya, longstanding aide to former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, is dead.</p>
      <p>Alhaji Pariya, better known as Mr Pee, passed on November 19 and has since been buried in accordance with Islamic rite.</p>
      <p>A statement by the Atiku Media Office described the death of the former Vice President’s Personal Assistant as sad and painful.</p>
      <p>The statement quoted Abubakar as saying: “He (Pariya) was a committed loyalist, a strong pillar of support in (my) life’s journeys and struggles in good, rough and uncertain times.</p>
      <p>“He gave a good account of his service to the nation and association with my humble self, right from our days in the Department of Customs and Excise spanning over three decades.</p>
      <p>“He showed love and solidarity to me and my family and in the process became a member of my family.”</p>
      <p>The former Vice President said he taking solace in the reality that Allah gives life and determines when He calls whomever He created.</p>
      <p>Abubakar said: “I commiserate with his wives, children and his friends; people who have benefitted from his kind-hearted nature. He was dear to many in high and low places. I will greatly miss him!”</p>
      <p>He prayed to Almighty Allah to forgive Pariya his sins and grant him Aljannah Firdaus.</p>
