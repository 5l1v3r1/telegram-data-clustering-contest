      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:57:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/chayanit-at-coconuts.co" target="_blank">Chayanit Itthipongmaetee</a></address>
      <p>The crowd roared as the “Gizz Wiz” rocked on the main stage for just over an hour when the keyboardist left his station, grabbed a mic, hopped on a speaker and crowd-surfed over the fans. </p>
      <p>Over on the middle stage, Tontrakul beamed Isaan culture through every flick of his naga-headed<i> phin </i>and breath through his <i>khaen</i> mouth organ. Before him, the audience formed a mini dance troupe of <i>serng</i>, the joyous northeastern folk dance. </p>
      <p>Over on the smallest of the three stages (the only indoor) at this past weekend’s Maho Rasop Festival, Canadian rapper Bbno$ bragged about his Tesla, worked the crowd with his frivolous-yet-infectious track <i>Shining on My Ex</i>, before jumping off the stage to swag and bump with his bouncing disciples.</p>
