        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 20 – There was drama in Kisumu on Wednesday morning when traffic police officers opened fire on EACC detectives during a sting operation on a roadblock.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The officers had moved in to arrest the officers following reports that they usually set up the roadblock at Mamboleo area.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“That is when the traffic police officers shot at them, but none of the EACC officers were injured,” one senior officer in Kisumu told Capital FM News.</p>
      <p>Instead, he said, a traffic officer was shot and injured by a bullet fired by his colleague before they were all arrested, handcuffed and driven away.</p>
      <p>According to an EACC officer, the detectives were responding to complaints from boda boda operators. An EACC report released Tuesday implicates the police department in rampant graft.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if the officers were found with any evidence, but EACC has confirmed that they were due in court later Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A report released by the EACC on Tuesday showed that there is rampant corruption in the National Police Service (NPS) under which the traffic department falls.</p>
