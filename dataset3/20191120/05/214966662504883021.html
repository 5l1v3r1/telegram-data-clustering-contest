      <h1>Mayor Tom Tate breaks silence on chief of staff’s suspension </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:10:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/mstclair/" target="_blank">Monique StClair</a></address>
      <p>City Hall’s been rocked, with news the Gold Coast Mayor’s most senior advisor has been stood down.</p>
      <p>Mayor Tom Tate’s Chief of Staff, Wayne Moran left council chambers yesterday, though city officials aren’t explaining why.</p>
      <p>After various requests for comment, a city spokesperson told myGC earlier today hat ‘it is not appropriate to comment on confidential matters involving City employees.’</p>
      <p>Mayor Tom Tate was remaining tight-lipped at a press conference on the Gold Coast this afternoon, however admitted that he was “shocked” by the news.</p>
      <p>“I cant comment on employees details and on the CCC matter I have absolutely no detail,” Mayor Tate said.</p>
      <p>“It’s always a shock because I didn’t know anything was going on, so from my point of view, assumed innocence is our rule so natural justice will prevail.</p>
      <p>“My attitude is, have I been personally under scrutiny by the CCC? Yeah, for about three years and there was nothing there so I don’t know.”</p>
      <p>“I’m always sad when someone departs without it being their own choosing, but at the moment he has not departed… He is not dismissed… He is stood down.”</p>
      <p>The Mayor confirmed that he has been in touch with Mr Moran since the news came out this morning.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard mate but my thing is, you don’t cut and run do you, it’s not the Aussie way, even though I’ve been emailed saying to stop talking to him,” he said.</p>
      <p>Luke Wallace has been appointed Acting Chief of Staff in the meantime.</p>
      <p>Moments after the news broke earlier on Wednesday morning, Councillor William Owen-Jones posted Green Day’s ‘Good Riddance’ song to Twitter.</p>
