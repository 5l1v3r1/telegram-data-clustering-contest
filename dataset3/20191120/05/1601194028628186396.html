      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> made his return to <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a>, albeit away from the ring, last week, on WWE Backstage. FOX announced that Punk would serve as an analyst on the Backstage show, and that we would see him weekly on Tuesday nights.</p>
      <p>Ryan Satin, founder of Pro Wrestling Sheet, is now a part of WWE Backstage and has a section called The Satin Sheet. He was backstage during Punk's return, and revealed that he and a majority of the backstage personnel did not know about Punk appearing on Backstage.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/ryan-satin-recalls-his-on-set-wwe-backstage-experience-from-662428">WrestlingInc</a>, Satin revealed the backstage reaction to CM Punk's return. He said,</p>
      <blockquote>"We had a production meeting and there was no Punk talk and nothing in the rundown. There was no word from anyone and no inkling whatsoever. Then I did my segment and when I was done, somebody came up to me and rushed me out into the control room."</blockquote>
      <p>He said that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/mick-foley">Mick Foley</a>, who was a part of the show, was as surprised as anyone.</p>
      <blockquote>"Mick Foley was in there and eating a sandwich. I was trying to post stories from my phone and right when I get the second one up, I hear [Punk's music] and my jaw dropped. I see him walk out and I'm like, 'Oh my God. Are you kidding me?'</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I turn around and ask Mick if he had any idea Punk was there. He goes, 'No, that's crazy' and goes back to eating his sandwich. Then I asked production and they had no idea. I was like, 'What the hell? That's crazy.' I had no idea and was just as surprised as anyone."</blockquote>
      <p>He said that he was a part of a production meeting earlier in the day and there was no talk about Punk on the show.</p>
