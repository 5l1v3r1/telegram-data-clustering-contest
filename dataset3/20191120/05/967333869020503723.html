        <b>Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born in 1889 in a guest house in the Austrian town of Braunau am Inn, near the border with Germany, where he spent the first three years of his childhood, as his father served as a customs official at the Austrian–German border.</b>

      <p>Austria’s interior minister announced in a statement on Tuesday that the nation will convert the house where Nazi leader Adolf Hitler was born into a police station. The move came in part as a means of preventing the structure from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-hitler-house/house-hitler-was-born-in-will-become-a-police-station-austria-says-idUSKBN1XT2QY">according to Reuters.</a></p>
      <blockquote>“The house’s future use by the police should send an unmistakable signal that this building will never again <a href="https://sputniknews.com/society/201904291074563090-hitler-death-disability-insurance-policy-auction/">evoke the memory of National Socialism</a>,” said Wolfgang Peschorn, Interior Minister of the Austrian interim government, in a statement quoted by Reuters.</blockquote>
      <p>The ministry statement said that the government is willing to invite architects from all of Europe to suggest redesigns for the 17th-century building, a subject of long dispute by its former owner, so as to turn it into a local police office by the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>Hitler, who <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201908121076531883-neo-nazis-linked-to-odinist-rituals-at-national-trust-sites-in-uk---report/">ruled Nazi Germany</a> in the period (1933-1945), initiated World War II (1939–1945) that killed over 75 million people.</p>
