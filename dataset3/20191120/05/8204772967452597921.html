      <h2>US clothing brand is latest retailer to join the line-up at successful Dublin scheme</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/ronald-quinlan-7.4729914" target="_blank">Ronald Quinlan</a></address>
      <p>Hollister is set to become the latest retailer to join the line-up at the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Blanchardstown+Centre">Blanchardstown Centre</a>.</p>
      <p>The American clothing brand has agreed a 10-year lease for a 582sq m (6,265sq ft) unit at the hugely-successful Dublin scheme. Agent BNP Paribas Real Estate brokered the deal on behalf of the centre's owners, Blackstone.</p>
      <p>Hollister will join JD Sports who signed up last year for a 1,100sq m (11,800sq ft) store within a 55,000sq ft extension that is under construction. Distributed across two levels adjoining Blanchardstown’s central mall, the development will comprise eight new retail units upon completion next year.</p>
      <p>Commenting on Hollister’s decision to locate at Blanchardstown, Pat Nash, managing director of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Multi+Ireland">Multi Ireland</a> &amp; UK, said: “This signing underlines the growth of our offering and our ability to provide the broadest retailing choice in both our retail parks and our covered malls.”</p>
      <p>Separately, Fingal County Council has granted planning permission for the development of an additional 3,200sq m (35,000sq ft) extension at Blanchardstown’s Blue Mall entrance.</p>
      <h3>Existing eateries</h3>
      <p>This space is being earmarked for the provision of a number of new restaurants ranging in size from 142sq m to 861sq m (1,528sq ft to 9,267sq ft). The extension will be located within close proximity to the Odeon cineplex and several of Blanchardstown’s existing eateries including Nando’s <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Milano">Milano</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Eddie+Rockets">Eddie Rockets</a>.</p>
