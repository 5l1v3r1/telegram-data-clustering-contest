      <h1>R-Truth loses 24/7 Title to WWE corporate employee at company headquarters before winning it back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:01:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author">WWE.com</a></address>
      <p>The 24/7 Championship isn’t even safe in a corporate setting.</p>
      <p>One of the more shocking turns in the title’s brief history occurred when R-Truth accidentally found himself front and center during a company meeting at WWE Headquarters in Stamford, Conn., on Tuesday. Michael, sitting front row, seized the opportunity of an R-Truth tumble and became WWE’s first corporate employee to win the championship.</p>
      <p>His reign, however, lasted mere hours. With Michael required to pass a brief fitness test involving five push-ups and five sit-ups before signing a talent contract, R-Truth swooped in to return the favor by pinning him and once again escaping with the 24/7 Title for the 23rd time.</p>
