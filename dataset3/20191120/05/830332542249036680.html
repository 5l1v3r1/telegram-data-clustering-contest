      <p>WAUKESHA, Wisc. - A Waukesha mailman has grown accustomed to having company as he makes his route along Allen Lane.</p>
      <p>Each day along the route, he's followed by a wild turkey from house to house as he makes his rounds.</p>
      <p>"For the last month, he's been pretty consistent with being out here every day," said Jeff Byrne. A veteran postman with the United States Postal Service for more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>It's a story of persistence as Byrne works to delivers mail. The turkey, on the other hand, hard at work, trying to keep Byrne off his turf.</p>
      <p>"Not sure if it's the color of the truck. Not sure what he really likes," Byrne said. "He was with a bunch of female turkeys."</p>
      <p>With a big smile on his face, Byrne set out for his delivery in the neighborhood Tuesday. He was aware of his new route companion.</p>
      <p>"It's just another day on the ride," Byrne said.</p>
      <p>The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said male turkeys, or Toms, can be very territorial during breeding seasons. The DNR also said the truck's bright lights could be a reason the turkey decided to follow.</p>
      <p>If things carry on, Byrne said he will carry a blowhorn to keep the turkey at bay.</p>
