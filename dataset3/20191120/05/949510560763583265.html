      <p>KINGSTON, N.Y. (AP) — Police say a 20-year-old college student has died after falling 150 feet from a cliff in an upstate New York park.</p>
      <p>Donald Christian, president of the State University of New York at New Paltz, identified the student Tuesday as Katherine Vollmer of Rochester. He said she was a visual arts major who transferred to New Paltz this fall from Monroe Community College.</p>
      <p>Police say Vollmer was hiking with a group exploring old cement caves and trails in Kingston’s Hasbrouck Park Monday evening when the group got lost in the dark. Police say Vollmer slipped at the edge of a cliff and landed in an area that could only be accessed by a technical rope team.</p>
      <p>The city fire department’s rope team recovered her body Tuesday morning.</p>
