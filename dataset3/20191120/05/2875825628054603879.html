      <h1>Sean Longstaff ready to fight for place in Newcastle line-up following suspension</h1>
      <h2>The young centre midfielder was linked with a move to Manchester United in the summer but has struggled for form this season and was sent off during the 1-1 draw against Wolves</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Sean Longstaff has admitted he's gone from hero to zero – and has to fight for a new deal at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> .</p>
      <p>The midfield star lost his first team berth after a red card against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> last month, after he and younger brother Matty earned rave reviews in the Toon engine room.</p>
      <p>Longstaff has hinted contract talks have stalled, with his representatives seeking pay parity with other first teamers.</p>
      <p>Newcastle chiefs want proof he's a regular influence in the first team before bumping up his contract, which was signed last December before he made his breakthrough.</p>
      <p>Longstaff, who's hit the gym during his suspension, has one more game of a three match suspension to serve and will be back in contention to face <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in 11 days.</p>

      <p>He said: “The ban is really frustrating. I don’t think any player wants to give up their place in the team. I think, when you get sent off, you give it up pretty cheaply. That was one of the things that disappointed me.</p>
      <p>“That’s football, isn’t it? You’re more thinking about the lows of getting sent off rather than the highs of the weeks before. Football changes so fast.</p>
      <p>“Me and Matty were everywhere, and everyone wanted to speak to us, and the next week you’re not involved and the team win against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> , and you’re sort of forgotten about. It’s about learning that that does happen in football.</p>
      <p>“Things aren’t going to go your way all the time. I knew I wasn’t going to play (against West Ham), but I thought Matty would. When he got left out, I was obviously really disappointed for him, but the manager made a decision and Jonjo came in and scored and Isaac came in and did really well.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to need everyone. We’ll look to push up the table, which everyone in the dressing room thinks we can.</p>

      <p>“Hopefully this is my little break from the team, and when I come back, I can get back in as soon as possible and get back to where I was.”</p>
      <p>Matty made his England U20 debut last week in Portugal and will be on the bench for Monday's trip to Aston Villa where Steve Bruce's men are seeking a three wins in a row. Bruce will persevere with Shelvey and Hayden anchoring midfield.</p>
      <p>Matty will pen a new deal imminently, being out of contract in June, but Sean may have to wait. Sean said: “It’s up to the club, what they want to do. There have been conversations. I don’t want to give too much away. That was a little while ago.</p>
      <p>“But, like I said, I’m not really worried about contracts and stuff like that. I’m just trying to concentrate on football. You didn’t play when you were younger to worry about contracts, and that’s how I’m looking at it now. I’m just continuing to work hard and do my job every day.”</p>
