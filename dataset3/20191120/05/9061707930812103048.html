      <p>A mum says the pain of her newborn baby son dying just 30 minutes after medics had said the tot was doing well never goes away.</p>
      <p>She will never forget the moment she was told baby Sam Ryan had died - even 19 years on.</p>
      <p>Wendy Wardle, from Horninglow, said: "They went out to my husband and told him our little boy was in really good condition. <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/family-young-mum-killed-drink-3482866">Half an hour later they went back to tell him he had died.</a></p>
      <p>"I was coming out of the anaesthetic when the nurse looked at my husband and asked him to tell me, he said he couldn’t do it, he was in pieces. She turned to me and said, 'Oh Wendy it is really really sad'.</p>
      <p>"I knew then before she said anything else.</p>
      <p>"That was 19 years ago now and I can remember everything like it was yesterday."</p>
      <p>She has shared her devastating story and said it is "bittersweet" that babies now are given a much better chance of life.</p>
      <p>She was speaking after it was announced that babies will be resuscitated at 22 weeks thanks to advances in medicine.</p>
      <p>Mrs Wardle was getting ready for a nightshift when her waters broke unexpectedly. At only 25 weeks pregnant, she knew something wasn’t right and rushed to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Now aged 54, she said: "It was a normal pregnancy and I already had three children including a seven-month-old baby.</p>
      <p>"I was absolutely fine and just getting ready for work as I worked nights and my waters broke. I went to hospital and I was given steroids.</p>
      <p>"I was transferred to hospital and they didn’t know whether to deliver him early or leave him to come naturally. There was some talk about delivering him on the Thursday but he wasn’t actually born until the Sunday.</p>

      <p>"I kept being told everyone was busy and we were left alone a lot. The machine kept beeping where his heartbeat was dipping and the buzzer was broke.</p>
      <p>"I found out afterwards that every time I had a contraction my cord was strangling him and cutting the oxygen supply off.</p>
      <p>"I was in labour when the midwife came into the room and pressed the emergency buzzer. It was terrifying."</p>
      <p>Sam Ryan was born weighing just one pound and 11 ounces and was breathing.</p>
      <p>She said: "After he was born the doctors worked on him for half an hour. He was born breathing.</p>
      <p>Wendy said nobody could give them the answers they wanted and she blamed herself for his death at the time, and fell into a depression.</p>

      <p>She said: "They let me see him but they didn’t have specialist rooms like they do now so I was on the ward with the other mums.</p>
      <p>"We went back home and the midwives visited - only they didn’t have a baby to check up on.</p>
      <p>"It was the worst feeling ever. I kept blaming myself telling myself that maybe he would have survived if he was born on the Thursday instead of the Sunday, but I think that if he had survived he would have been severely disabled.</p>
      <p>"I was angry that there were not enough intensive care cots and I knew someone else whose baby had the same gestation but was born in Burton and survived."</p>
      <p>"We had a funeral after that was arranged by hospital staff. They were brilliant.</p>
      <p>"He had a little white coffin and my husband carried him in. It was just us two there and we took his ashes home.</p>
      <p>"It was just a blur. I was depressed."</p>
      <p>Wendy, who now has five children and three grandchildren, said she is pleased to see that medicine has come a long way and that more can be done for premature babies now than when she had Sam.</p>
      <p>She said: "<a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/emma-eyley-swadlincote-child-sight-3419507">There is a lot more survival now among babies</a> and they are given a much better chance which is amazing but it is really bittersweet because I can’t help but wonder why that didn’t happen for me.</p>
      <p>"I learned afterwards that I had a cord prolapse but I did have another pregnancy not long afterwards. Sam was born on March 27 and the following year, almost to the day, we welcomed a little girl on March 31.</p>
      <p>"As time goes on you do wonder what he would have been like and how things could have been different. The pain is something that never goes away."</p>
