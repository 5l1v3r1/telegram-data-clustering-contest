      <h1>EU must help regions hit by cost of going green, EIB chief warns</h1>
      <h2>Financial support vital for countries that rely on the fuel, says Werner Hoyer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:00:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Fleming, Mehreen Khan</a></address>
      <p>Europe must step up support for regions hard hit by the costs of going green, the head of the EU’s investment bank has warned, as the bloc gears up for a funding battle over its climate change objectives.</p>
      <p>Werner Hoyer, president of the European Investment Bank, told the FT it was “understandable” that Poland, Hungary and Romania had last week voted against a landmark decision for the lender to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e90906a-ee9f-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">phase out fossil fuel lending </a>by 2021, saying they would be hardest hit by the move.</p>
      <p>The EIB — the world’s largest multilateral lender — and Brussels would need to provide support to countries and regions that were heavily dependent on the coal industry, he said in an interview.</p>
      <p>“What can we offer the member states in order to support growth and jobs in these regions, [the] most affected regions — that’s the challenge we are facing,” Mr Hoyer said.</p>
      <p>The EU is aiming to become the first climate neutral major economy in the world by 2050. The European Commission has estimated it will cost €300bn to fund the economic transition to reach the target, with the bulk of spending needed in higher-polluting countries in central and eastern Europe. </p>
      <p>As well as rejecting the EIB decision to phase out fossil fuel investments, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have not yet signed up to the 2050 goal over concerns about the costs of the transition.</p>

      <p>They are postponing their decision until <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7acce5e8-dda3-11e9-b112-9624ec9edc59">Ursula von der Leyen</a>, incoming commission president, presents her promised “Green New Deal” next month, which will include a “Just Transition Fund” to help regions that will bear most of the economic cost.</p>
      <p>Coal accounts for nearly a quarter of EU electricity production, according to the commission. It remains a significant industry in more than 40 regions and provides 240,000 jobs in mines and power plants. </p>
      <p>Affected countries, including Poland, have demanded substantial EU funding to pay for the transition, setting up a showdown with member states that want to limit the size of Brussels’ next long-term budget. The so-called frugal five of Berlin, The Hague, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki want to limit the size of the next budget to 1 per cent of EU gross national income, constraining support for the green transition.</p>
      <p>Mr Hoyer said the EIB would still offer polluting countries economic support after fossil fuel funding was stopped: “We are going to certainly not reduce our lending to these countries only because we don’t finance fossil fuel projects any more after 2021. Probably the opposite will be true.” </p>

      <p>With the EIB promising to expand its loans to poorer member states, the lender is also under pressure to tighten up its internal controls to prevent money being disbursed to projects linked to corruption. </p>
      <p>In a report this week, Counter Balance, a coalition of NGOs that scrutinises public investment banks, concluded the EIB was “not up to the task in tackling fraud and corruption”. </p>
      <p>According to the report, the EIB continued to distribute funds to highway building projects near Venice that were implicated in corruption investigations. The report highlighted the Passante di Mestre highway bypass and the Mose scheme from 2003 — both projects where local politicians and public officials were found guilty of corruption as part of wider “Veneto” crime networks.</p>
      <p>Mr Hoyer said the EIB had a “no tolerance” approach to criminal risks and that the lender only operated in member states with a “solid framework for the rule of law”. </p>
      <p>But, he added: “The problem is that in too many cases we have allegations and processes going on and insufficient proof to take a decision which harms a contract or contracting partner.”</p>
