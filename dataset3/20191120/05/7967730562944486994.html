      <h1>Christian Porter open to further concessions on union-busting bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T05:59:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 05:59</time> by <a rel="author">Dana McCauley</a></address>
      <p>Attorney-General Christian Porter is open to granting further concessions to unions to win crossbench support for the government's industrial relations bill and secure its passage when Parliament resumes next week.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter needs the support of either Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie or One Nation's Pauline Hanson to get the union-busting Ensuring Integrity Bill through the upper house, but both have expressed concerns about its impact on unions' ability to advocate for workers.</p>

      <p>Asked if he would agree to raise the threshold of the demerit point system under which unions could be banned and officials disqualified, the minister said he was "absolutely" open to negotiating further changes to what he described as a "three strikes" system.</p>
      <p>Senators Hanson and Lambie on Wednesday joined Labor in demanding the Morrison government publicly release the amendments it had <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53a9m.html">crafted in talks with Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick</a>, who said he was open to lifting the threshold.</p>
      <p>One Nation has released its own proposed amendments, which aim to to ensure only officials convicted of criminal offences - or fined over significant workplace law breaches - can be disqualified.</p>

      <p>The Australian Council of Trade Unions says the demerit point system - under which a union official could be disqualified if they accrued 180 penalty units of workplace law breaches, or their union racked up 900 penalty units - would unfairly punish volunteer officials for paperwork errors.</p>
      <p>It remains unclear over what timeframe the demerit points would be calculated, with the ACTU concerned by the possibility accidental breaches may add up over time to capture even the least-militant unions.</p>
      <p>Mr Porter said the demerit point approach would create "a fair system" while allowing the bill to achieve its aim of clamping down on unlawful behaviour on Australian construction sites by the militant Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union.</p>
      <p>Senator Lambie, who has previously <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52p7l.html">vowed to vote for the bill if CFMMEU Victorian secretary John Setka did not resign</a>, said in a statement on Wednesday that she would not vote for any legislation if she was unsure of how it would operate.</p>

      <p>"You don't end the career of a union official or cancel the registration of a union on a lark," she said.</p>
      <p>Senator Hanson said One Nation was seeking its own amendments to the bill "after listening to the unions and their members who took the time to consult with my office".</p>
      <p>"I won't stand for union bashing and therefore I won't support the deregistration of organisations for misdemeanour offences like late paperwork submissions," she said.</p>
      <p>"I have, however, forewarned union bosses that bullying and thuggery must be stamped out in accordance with public expectations."</p>
      <p>Senator Hanson said unions had "raised a quantity of genuine concerns" about the original draft of the bill and demanded Mr Porter "release all amendments ... ASAP".</p>
      <p>Senator Lambie agreed, saying the crossbench "needs to take the time to get the views of people who have skin in the game".</p>
