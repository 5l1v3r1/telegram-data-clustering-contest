      <p>Netflix just released the trailer for “V Wars,” Ian Somerhalder’s latest vampires series — but this time, he’s not the bloodthirsty one.</p>
      <p>The former “Vampire Diaries” star, known for playing sexy-vampire Damon Salvatore over the show’s eight seasons, stars in “V Wars” as Dr. Luther Swann, a disease specialist who is faced with a tough choice when his best friend (Adrian Holmes) catches the mysterious virus that’s turning people into vampires left and right. You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1kuAdVKvuE">full trailer</a> above.</p>
      <p>Based on Jonathan Maberry’s best-selling books, Somerhalder executive produces, stars in, and directs one of the episodes of the series’ first 10-episode season. Other cast members include Holmes (Michael Fayne), Jacky Lai (Kaylee Vo), Peter Outerbridge (Calix Niklos), Kyle Breitkopf (Dez), Laura Vandervoot (Mila Dubov), Kimberly-Sue Murray (Danika Dubov).</p>
      <blockquote>Here is Netflix’s official logline:<br/><i>“Dr. Luther Swann (Ian Somerhalder) enters a world of untold horror when a mysterious disease transforms his best friend, Michael Fayne (Adrian Holmes), into a murderous predator who feeds on other humans. As the disease spreads and more people are transformed, society fractures into opposing camps pitting normal people against the growing number of these ‘vampires.’ Swann races against time to understand what’s happening, while Fayne rises to become the powerful underground leader of the vampires.”</i></blockquote>
      <p>High Park Entertainment produces in association with IDW Entertainment. William Laurin and Glenn Davis serve as showrunners, and executive produce with Somerhalder, Glenn Davis, Brad Turner, Eric Birnberg, Thomas Walden, James Gibb, Lydia Antonini, Matthew McCluggage, Paul Harb, Ted Adams, and Maberry.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“V Wars” premieres Dec. 5 on Netflix.</i>
