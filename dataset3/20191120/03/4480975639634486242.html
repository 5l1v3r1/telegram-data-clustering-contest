      <p>Reuters reports the latest comments from the Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, as he makes some comments on varied topics.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>"I hope the UK will join Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) after leaving the EU."</p>
      <p>"I hope China will conduct economic activity within new, 21st century rules."</p>
      <p>"No change to view that economy is recovering."</p>
      <p>"US-China tensions have weighed on global demand, which has impacted Japanese production."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair keeps its recovery mode intact from 108.36 lows, but the further upside appears to lack momentum amid fresh US-China political tensions concerning the Hong Kong human rights bill.</p>
