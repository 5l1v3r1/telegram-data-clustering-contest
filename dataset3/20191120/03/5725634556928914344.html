      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We did not see any significant movements in the sector. Over the past week, the benchmark reported a slight increase.</li>
        <li>We continue to see a strong correlation between the high-yield bonds and the stock market.</li>
        <li>Taking into account the high Z-scores of the high-yield, closed-end funds, I am not going to review a fund as a potential long candidate.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>
          <b>Introduction</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The closed-end funds from the high-yield sector significantly increased their prices over the past months. Currently, most of them are traded at positive Z-scores, which is an indication that they have lost most of their statistical edge. Still, they are traded at high discounts, but we are cautious when we select our positions, due to the lack of statistical edge. For me, personally, I am in a waiting mode to see a statistical opportunity to review some of the funds.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>The Benchmark</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Low trading volume and almost no change for the benchmark of the sector. Over the past week, the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HYG">HYG</a>) rose by $0.09 per share and finished Friday's session at $86.94 per share. Recently, we do observe a lower correlation between the stock market and high-yield bonds. The stock market continues its rally and reached an all-time high. On the other hand, the high-yield sector does not have the same buying impulse and is trading around the current price levels.</p>

        <b>Statistical Comparison And Spread Review Of The Sector</b>
      </p>
      <p>High-yield bonds are typically evaluated on the difference between their yield and the yield on the U.S. Treasury bond. High-yield spreads are used by investors and market analysts to evaluate the overall credit markets. Higher spreads indicate a higher default risk in junk bonds and can be a reflection of the overall corporate economy and/or a broader weakening of macroeconomic conditions. On a weekly basis, we notice an increase of 0.12 bps.</p>

      <p>Below, you can find a statistical comparison between HYG and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLT">TLT</a>). We observe a correlation of 0.83 points between the two sectors for the last 200-day period:</p>

      <p>On the other hand, we have a statistical comparison between HYG and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 Trust ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY">SPY</a>). There is definitely a stronger relationship between them for the last 200 days. As you can see, it is 0.89 points.</p>

          <b>Important Update</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Before starting our weekly review, I want to inform you about one change in the classification of the closed-end funds which invest in high-yield bonds in CEFConnect. Several funds have been added to the sector, and the High Income Securities Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCF">PCF</a>) has been excluded. Our articles will be in line with the updates, and we are going to review the sector based on these changes.</p>

      <p>Recently, we have observed a lower correlation between the stock market and the closed-end funds which invest in high-yield bonds. Day after day, we see new historical highs from the stock market, but the high-yield bonds did not impress us with the same performance. Once again, a hesitant week for the closed-end funds from the sector, as their prices were moving in different directions.</p>
      <p>When I prepare my weekly analysis for the closed-end funds, I always include the Z-score as a statistical criterion which helps me to acquire a better grasp of the situation in the sector. If the funds are traded at very low Z-scores, it usually means I will be a more aggressive buyer and will try to take advantage of the statistical edge. Currently, most of the high-yield funds are traded at positive Z-score, and we do not find so strong of a statistical logic to review them as potential <b>"Long"</b> candidates. Therefore, I am more cautious right now when I am entering into a position, and of course, the number of the shares that I take is smaller.</p>
      <p>Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HIO">HIO</a>) is one of the funds with the lowest Z-scores, and it may be very attractive option for those of you who want to buy a fund that does not use leverage. According to the latest information, the discount which you can buy the fund at is 8.93%, and its current yield is 7.20%.</p>

      <p>The credit quality of the portfolio is one of the best in the sector, as 41.67% of the holdings are labeled as "BB" rating.</p>

      </p>
      <p>On top of that, the earnings/coverage ratio of HIO is 99.00%, which is an indicator that the earnings of the portfolio are enough high to cover the dividend.</p>

      <p>Conversely, if we are looking for statistically overpriced funds, we need to sort the funds by the highest Z-score. Ð•xpectedly, with the increase in prices of funds from the sector, we start to see higher Z-scores. Here, we need to take into consideration that the prices plummeted over the past year, and this is one of the main reasons to see funds with a discount of around 8% as having such high Z-scores.</p>
      <p>My style is not based on the popular "Buy and Hold" approach, and when I see statistically overpriced assets without any significant fundamental reason, I prefer to re-allocate my money in some similar investment with lower Z-score. The closed-end funds with a Z-score above 2.00 points may be considered as statistically overpriced from my perspective.</p>
      <p>The average Z-score of the high-yield CEFs is 1.32 points. On a weekly basis, we find an increase of 0.02 bps of the average value. It is pretty interesting to notice the drastic change. At the end of December 2018, we had -3.43 points average Z-score, and now, it is above 1.00 point.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The next factor, which I consider as important, is the spread between the net asset value and price. Most of the funds are still trading at a discount, and the period remains favorable to include some of them to your portfolio based on this criterion. No doubt, if you combine the attractive discount with a relatively low Z-score, the chances for a capital gain are even higher.</p>
      <p>From the above sample, the New America High Income Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HYB">HYB</a>) is one of the potential <b>"Buys"</b> which caught my eye. It has a below-average value of the Z-score, which is accompanied by an attractive discount of 10.48%. We do have a yield on the price of 7.47% and yield on the net asset value of 6.68%. The current distribution is $0.0550, and it is paid on a monthly basis. There are two very important facts that I want to highlight here. The first one is related to the soundness of the dividend. Over the past decade, it was changed only a few times due to changes in the market environment. The small fluctuations and stability of the distributions make HYB a perfect choice for investors who want to increase the returns of their portfolios.</p>

        <i>Source: CEFData</i>
      </p>
      <p>The second very important point which I want to discuss is related to past results. The management team of HYB proved its quality and managed to outperform most of its peers by return on net asset value for the last five and ten years.</p>

      <p>The average discount/premium of the high-yield CEFs is -3.95%. Last week, the average spread between prices and net asset values was -4.76%.</p>

      <p>Barings Participation Investors (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MPV">MPV</a>) and Barings Corporate Investors (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCI">MCI</a>) continue to be the leaders in this sector by premium. The solid past performance is one of the main reasons why market participants pay such prices for them.</p>
      <p>From my perspective, the MFS Intermediate High Income Fund (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIF">CIF</a>) may be a risky investment at these levels. It is traded almost at net asset value, mainly because the fund offers a high current yield. It seems like the market participants do not take into consideration the fact that the earnings of the portfolios are below the required amount to cover the dividends.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Above are the funds that outperformed their peers by return on net asset value for the past five years. The average return on NAV for that period is 5.42% for the sector. As you can see, most of the current yields on price and net asset values are higher than the historical ones.</p>

        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <p>The high-yield sector does not provide us with significant arbitrage opportunities at present. Most of the CEFs are trading at discounts, and it is difficult to find so many potential <b>"Short"</b> candidates. On the other hand, there are still interesting funds which provide us with an attractive valuation based on the discount, and we can review them as potential <b>"Buy"</b> candidates if their Z-scores are not too high. However, we should be careful when the situation in the market seems unstable and the riskier assets such as high-yield bonds and CEFs may be affected by the volatility.</p>
