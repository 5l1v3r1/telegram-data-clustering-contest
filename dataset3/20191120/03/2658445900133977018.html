      <h4>Our Reporter</h4>
      <p>Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) has paid over N3 billion as compensation to beneficiaries. The payments were made under different contingencies such as injury, disabilities and death in a working place as at September.</p>
      <p>The organisation has also started widening its net to cover workers in the informal sector.</p>
      <p>Its Lagos General Manager, Mrs. Olufunke Alesinloye, said the Fund was already holding meetings with members of the informal sector to ensure they are captured in the Employees Compensation Scheme (ECS).</p>
      <p>“We have held meetings twice with those in the informal sector. Those at the meetings comprise market women and other artisans cutting across several trades,” she said.</p>
      <p>She, however, noted that the challenges of capturing the informal sector was with record keeping, adding that this might not be insurmountable.</p>

      <p>She said: “Just like PenCom, which started in 2004 and only been able to pluck in the informal sector this year, we are also working seriously to device means by which we can get them organised.</p>
      <p>“We know we cannot have all the sectors take off at the same time, but definitely the workers in the informal sector can register. Even a one-man business owner can register, but there must be some identification that country will recognise.”</p>
      <p>Alesinloye said self-employed workers, who had Tax Identification Number (TIN) with proper tax return, could immediately register and begin to tap into opportunities available under the scheme.</p>
      <p>She said the scheme registers only employers, but it is employees that get the claim.</p>
      <p>Alesinloye added that the Fund, whose board has representatives from workers’ group, Employers group and government, had recorded giant strides in the ECS.</p>
      <p>She said: “As at 30th September, we’ve paid over N3 billion, received 32,000 claims. We have 391 numbers of dependants from those who died and we are supporting the families until the last child is 18. For disability benefits, we have 496, given arms and legs to 54. In payments to families who lost their members, we have those receiving N1.8million, N1.7million, and N1.2million as monthly payment.</p>
      <p>“For those with disability, the highest paid is in the oil and gas, N721,000 and another in the Army, N291,000 monthly, respectively. There’s also a helicopter accident, there’s no dependant, but we paid aggregate of his five years’ salary to his family.”</p>
