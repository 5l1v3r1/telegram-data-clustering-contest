      <p>UK-BASED coach Craig Moniz has described Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen as potential target for the Gunners following speculation over possible exit of Arsenal strikers, Alexander Lacazette, and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.</p>
      <p>He enthused   that since Aubameyang has contributed to 47% of Arsenal’s goals this season; Osimhen stands out if there is a possibility of    looking across upcoming talents in Europe for a possible replacement for the Gabonese,</p>
      <p>Craig said the 20-year-old Nigerian who currently plies his trade in France for Lille is a realistic and believable option on Arsenal’s radar.</p>
      <p>“Following a record-breaking goal-scoring performance at the FIFA U17 World Cup; Barcelona and Arsenal both offered him positions at their clubs. He instead chose to go to Wolfsburg in Germany however as he wanted to regularly be involved in first-team football. Landing in Lille last summer he has burst into mainstream attention,” Craig said.</p>
      <p>He continued: “Osimhen has scored seven  goals and assisted two in 11 starts for Lille this season.  What makes him so prolific as a goal scorer is his off the ball movement.</p>

      <p>“ Similarly to Aubameyang, he’s able to create space for himself and intelligently get himself in goal scoring spaces. Calculated and clever, he is at home when he’s inside the box.</p>
      <p>“Commonly benefiting from players out wide making chances; whether if the opposing defence is settled in shape or transitioning he’s just as effective,” he added.</p>
      <p>Moniz, author  of  Football Bloody Hell,  further highlighted the qualities of the Nigeria youngster:</p>
      <p>“Combining Osimhen’s intelligent movements with the talented skillset, the youngster possesses and you have someone with the potential to be a world-class striker.</p>
      <p>“He always knows where the goal is even when he receives the ball with his back to goal he is able to quickly turn and make a shot. His finishes are lethal as he generates immense power on them.</p>
