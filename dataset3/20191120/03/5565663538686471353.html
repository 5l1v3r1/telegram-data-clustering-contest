      <p>ZAPU leadership were Tuesday summoned by Plumtree police for shutting down St Anne's Nursing School in Brunapeg, Mangwe following the recruitment of non-locals at the hospital.<br/><br/>Last week, a group comprising of ZAPU members and villagers besieged the hospital to register their displeasure after reports said not even one of the recruited nursing students was from the area.<br/><br/>After that action, seven local ZAPU members were detained overnight and police charged one â€“ Nelson Khupe for conducting an illegal demonstration at the hospital while the other six became state witnesses.<br/><br/>This Tuesday morning, The CID Law and Order section in Plumtree summoned members of ZAPU's executive and charged them for allegedly holding an unsanctioned demonstration at St Anne's Hospital.<br/><br/>Their lawyer Prince Butshe-Dube of Mathonsi Law Chambers, confirmed to CITE that the party executive were summoned by police and he accompanied them to the station.<br/><br/>"The ZAPU members were National Organising Secretary John Zolani Dlamini, Matabeleland South Province Chairman Matthew Bhubesi Sibanda and Southern Region Communications Director Patrick Ndlovu.<br/><br/>"The accused gave warned and cautioned statements and then were released by the police. The trio were summoned last week to present themselves to the police this morning," he said<br/><br/>Meanwhile ZAPU is preparing to mount a legal challenge against the controversial recruitment of trainee nurses at health institutions in Matabeleland.<br/><br/>This follows overtures by the opposition party to have the government reverse the recruitment process.<br/><br/>Despite this, the Ministry of Health and Child Care has since released an advertisement saying it has started receiving online applications from aspiring nurses countrywide for the January 2020 intake.<br/><br/>The opposition party recently staged a sit-in at Mpilo Hospital after it emerged that the bulk of trainee nurses recruited at training institutions in Matabeleland were dominated by non-locals.</p>
