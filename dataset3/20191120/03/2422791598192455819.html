      <p>TORONTO – The dying wishes of a Yukon man who created an infamous drink known as the “Sourtoe Cocktail” will be granted after he willed his own toes to keep the tradition alive.</p>
      <p>Dick Stevenson, the former bartender at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City, died last week at the age of 89.</p>
      <p>Stevenson, who locals would call “Captain Dick,” is most known for creating the Sourtoe Cocktail, which includes a shot of whisky and a pickled human toe in a single glass.</p>
      <p>“He was a fairly colourful character as many people in town (who) lived here for many years are,” Steven Lancaster, general manager of the Downtown Hotel, told CTV News Channel.</p>
      <p>Stevenson created the drink in 1973 after discovering a frost-bitten human toe in a cabin he bought.</p>
      <p>Lancaster said to date 92,579 people have officially taken the shot, which includes a stipulation that your lips must touch the toe during consumption.</p>
      <p>Those who complete the shot are added to the “Sourtoe Cocktail Club,” which is expected to reach 100,000 members in the summer.</p>
      <p>Determined to continue the tradition, Stevenson dedicated his ashes and each of his toes to the hotel in order to keep the tradition alive.</p>
      <p>“We wants it carry on, he’s willed his toes and his ashes to the Downtown Hotel, so his thing that he created here can live on,” Lancaster said.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the hotel has lost about 15 toes, including some that have been stolen. Five of the toes have been swallowed.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got 12 new toes that we’re currently using and they get rotated and cleaned and we just use what we have,” he said.</p>
      <p>Lancaster said he was travelling through Dawson City when he first heard of the signature drink and convinced to try it after a few cocktails of his own.</p>
      <p>“After a couple of pushes, I’ve done it twice already now,” he said. “It’s interesting, but it’s not that bad.”</p>
      <p>Lancaster would later down is third Sourtoe Cocktail during the interview.</p>
