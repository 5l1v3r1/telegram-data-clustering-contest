      <h1>How UCC's counterfeit phone machine works – Techjaja</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:41:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:41</time> by <a rel="author">mousalgf</a></address>
      <p>In July, Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) confirmed that they are in the <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/ucc-in-final-stages-of-switching-off-fake-phones/">final stages of switching off</a> counterfeit phones. About a year ago<a href="https://www.techjaja.com/deadline-set-all-fake-phones-to-be-switched-off-in-uganda/"> UCC had set a 3 month deadline</a> where it assured the public that all fake phones will be disconnected. Even if now know that the machine is<a href="https://www.techjaja.com/fake-phone-detection-machine-is-now-operational/"> operational– at least under test</a>, UCC is still no clear when it will be officially operational.</p>
      <p>Counterfeit phones are those that infringe trademarks, and can contain more hazardous substances like lead and cadmium than genuine ones, while fake phone chargers can mean fire and electric shock risks.</p>
      <p><a href="http://ucc.co.ug/">UCC</a>, which is legally mandated to authenticate communications apparatus, operates a counterfeit phone machine which is called a Central Equipment Identification Registry (CEIR) through which Phone devices can be denied access to the network if they are counterfeit or not type-approved.</p>
      <h3>How the CEIR will work</h3>

      <p>In addition to blocking counterfeit phone devices, the CEIR is capable of rendering stolen phones worthless as any device reported lost or stolen can be blocked if the service provider is requested to take such action.</p>
      <p>The Minister of ICT and National Guidance to early this year issued the Uganda Communications (Centralized Equipment Identification Register) Regulations 2019 to “detect and deny communications services operated on an unauthorized or blacklisted communications apparatus.”</p>
      <p>The main objective of the Regulations is “to provide a procedure for reporting the use of unauthorized communications apparatus and a means to disable the functioning of unauthorized, stolen or blacklisted communications apparatus.”</p>
      <p>Among other provisions, the Regulations state that where the Central Equipment Identification Registry (CEIR) detects mobile communications apparatus with an invalid, incorrect or illegitimate IMEI, the CEIR manager shall notify the subscriber, using SMS alert or other means, about the status of their communications apparatus and specify a timeframe within which service will be denied.</p>
      <p>Upon the expiry of the specified timeframe, the counterfeit phone will be blacklisted and denied access to all services, except emergency services, the Regulations state. When it comes to stolen or lost devices, the CEIR manager is to blacklist all communications apparatus reported as stolen, damaged and lost, upon receipt of a Police statement. With that, the Regulations indicate, a service operator shall deny service to the blacklisted device.</p>
      <h3>How to check a counterfeit phone</h3>
      <p>Before you buy a phone, customers are advised to check the IMEI before purchasing a device. This can be done by simply dialing <b>*#06#</b>. In most phones, the IMEI is usually printed inside the handset, below the battery.</p>
      <p>This 15-digit code is a number assigned to each mobile device manufactured in accordance with internationally agreed safety and quality requirements. In simple terms, an IMEI is the serial number of a mobile device.</p>
      <p>The IMEI is automatically registered with the mobile service provider as soon as a device has been activated. For every call made, the mobile device provider gets to know the IMEI number. If the device is dual-SIM by design, which means both SIM cards can be connected to the network at the same time, it has two IMEI numbers.</p>
      <p>Illegitimate, cloned or missing IMEI aside, counterfeit devices tend to have the following characteristics;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manufacturer’s logo appears superficial and easy to rub off</li>
        <li>Color of the device is not among those indicated by the manufacturer for that particular model</li>
        <li>The device has different features from those associated with that model according to the manufacturer</li>
        <li>Devices of the same make and model appear in different sizes and shapes</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Are counterfeit phones sub-standard?</h3>
      <p>It should be noted that counterfeit phones are not necessarily ‘sub-standard’. While counterfeit devices tend to be substandard, some devices that are not necessarily counterfeit are equally substandard.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the surest way to confirm a device’s legitimacy is having an authentic IMEI number, which is also the basis for satisfying the minimum international standards required for quality and safety.</p>
