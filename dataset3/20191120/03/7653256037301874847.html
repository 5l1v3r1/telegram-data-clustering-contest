      <p>Rich traders with an appetite for risk could initiate a call ratio spread in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Reliance-Industries">Reliance Industries</a>. Analysts believe the momentum, which drove the stock to a fresh high of Rs 1514.90 Tuesday, could persist in the near term on hopes of improving prospects for its telco business amid debt concerns at rivals Vodafone Idea and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bharti-airtel-ltd/stocks/companyid-2718.cms">Bharti Airtel</a>.</p>
      <p>The strategy consists of buying a 1520-strike call and simultaneously selling two calls at the 1580-strike. Both the options expire on November 28. The sale of the two higher strikes reduces the overall debit but also exposes the trader to unlimited risk, if the upside is sharper than expected. If the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/reliance-industries-ltd/stocks/companyid-13215.cms">RIL</a> share consolidates, the trader can book out with a small loss as the time decay will eat into the premia of the sold higher strikes too.</p>
      <p>Using rounded off provisional prices Tuesday, the 1520-strike closed at Rs 25 and the 1580 at Rs 7 a share (500 shares make a lot). The sale of the two 1580 calls reduces the debit (1520 buy) to Rs 11 (25-14). The loss of Rs 11 happens if RIL closes at or below Rs 1520. At the other end, above Rs 1629, the loss could be unlimited unless a stop loss is placed at, say, Rs 1600, because an extra option has been sold.</p>
      <p>Bhavin Mehta, VP, Dolat Capital, and Rajesh Palviya, derivatives expert at Axis Securities, expect the strategy to deliver in a few days, failing which the positions could be squared off at a very limited loss. Mehta added that placing a stop loss at slightly above 1580 was a “must” to prevent a huge loss in the event of a “sharperthan-expected” move.</p>
      <p>The maximum profit of Rs 49 a share happens at Rs 1580. Above that level till Rs 1629, the profit keeps reducing. At Rs 1629 is the upper breakeven point, beyond which losses multiply. For instance, if RIL expires at or trades at Rs 1650, the 1520 call will be in the money (ITM) by a net Rs 119 as profit commences above Rs 1531. The two 1580 calls are ITM Rs 140, implying a loss of Rs 21a share.</p>
      <p>Placing a stop loss at Rs 1600 is advised, said Viral Berawala of Buoyant Capital. At that level the purchased 1520 call will be a net Rs 69 ITM, while the two sold 1580 calls will be worth Rs 40, implying a net profit of Rs 29.</p>
      <p>The stock closed Tuesday at Rs 1511.55 on NSE, before hitting a record high of Rs 1514.9. A slight rise in bullish futures bets on the near month coupled with short covering by call sellers at the 1500 strike helped buoy the share. Call sellers covered 10.05 lakh share at the 1500 strike which has the highest open interest at 16.3 lakh shares. The 1440 put has the highest OI, implying a strong support at that level. Further short covering by 1500 call sellers could take the stock higher.</p>
