      <h2>If you are looking to explore challenging workouts, Disha Patani's parkour sessions are impression-worthy.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:57:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/lifestyle-desk/" target="_blank">Lifestyle Desk</a></address>
      <p>Disha Patani, who is known for her stellar workout videos, recently shared on Instagram a clip of her trying the “kong vault”. The movement that involves jumping over an obstacle is part of parkour, a training exercise developed by the military. Parkour practitioners aim to get from one point to another in the fastest and most efficient manner without using any equipment.</p>
      <p>The <i>Malang </i>Actor captioned the video, “After ages trying my hand on kong vault, back to training with @Nadeemakhtarparkour88.”</p>

      <p>Parkour was originally developed by the military as a tactical skill and a way to build the fitness of soldiers. While parkour involves running, freerunning, climbing, swinging, vaulting, jumping, plyometrics, rolling, quadrupedal movement (crawling) and other movements, kong vault is a type of parkour vault which is useful for jumping over long objects, such as large barriers.</p>
      <p>It is said that the discipline was first developed in France in the late 1980s, but was popularised through Internet videos, television commercials, and feature films, including the 2006-James Bond film <i>Casino Royale</i>.</p>

      <h3>Here are basic moves in parkour.</h3>
      <h4>Running</h4>
      <p>Parkour training helps condition one to the demands of running. However, consider adding in marathon runs and wind sprints to speed things along.</p>
      <h4>Balancing</h4>
      <p>Balancing is a vital skill to have in Parkour since one is constantly walking and jumping on to small areas like rails and wall edges. One needs to develop the muscle strength and coordination necessary.</p>
      <h4>Jumping</h4>

      <p>Use jumps to overcome height differences. Precision jumps allow one to land on small areas, like the small surface on top of a wall or maybe a stepping stone in the middle of a body of water. Precision jumps require concentration, balance, and an awareness of your limitations.across gaps and over obstacles.</p>
      <h4>Landing</h4>

      <p>As an essential skill in parkour, landing helps one to immediately get up and keep moving to the next obstacle. Patani managed her first front flip post-injury, and posted, “Finally landed my first front flip! Didnt attempt a front tuck because of fear post my knee injury…happy i overcame my fear.”</p>
