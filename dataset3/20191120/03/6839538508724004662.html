      <p>SA is facing extreme fire conditions this week. Here is a guide to surviving a scorcher.</p>
      <p>Go online to <a href="https://www.cfs.sa.gov.au/site/home.jsp">cfs.sa.gov.au</a> and create your essential plan of what you will do in the event of a fire.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PLAN TO LEAVE EARLY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leaving early means leaving before your chosen escape route is compromised by fire and smoke, or by strong winds that may bring down trees and power lines, well before the fire arrives.</p>
      <p>The only way to guarantee this is to leave before a bushfire even starts – the night before or early in the day of a forecast fire danger day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>WHEN TRAVELLING IN A BUSHFIRE RISK AREA ALWAYS:</b>
      </p>
      <p>■ Check weather conditions before leaving</p>
      <p>■ Stay alert for smoke</p>
      <p>■ Don’t drive towards smoke</p>
      <p>■ Always carry water</p>
      <p>■ Listen for warnings on ABC or local radio</p>
      <p>■ Where to go: Bushfire Safer Places in SA</p>
      <p>Check the CFS website (<a href="https://www.cfs.sa.gov.au/site/home.jsp">cfs.sa.gov.au</a>) for the list of “bushfire safer places” and “last resort refuges” that offer relative safety. It is important that you know what each of these are, where they are and what risk you may be exposed to if you use one of these options during a bushfire.</p>
      <p>
        <b>IF YOU GET CAUGHT BY A BUSHFIRE:</b>
      </p>
      <p>■ Don’t get out of the car and run</p>
      <p>■ Protect yourself from heat.</p>
      <p>■ Pull over into a burnt or clear area</p>
      <p>■ Close windows and vents and put on hazard lights and headlights</p>
      <p>■ Get down below window level and shelter under woollen blankets</p>
