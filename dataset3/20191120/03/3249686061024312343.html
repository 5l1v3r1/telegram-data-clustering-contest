      <p>On the first episode of <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/bts">BTS</a>'s '<b>Bon Voyage</b>' season 4, airing exclusively via '<b>Weverse</b>', <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/suga">SUGA</a> let fans know that he will be dropping a new mixtape some time soon. Fans are theorizing this new mixtape will be called '<b>Agust D 2</b>' ,as a sequel to '<b>Agust D</b>' released in 2016.</p>
      <p>During the 'Bon Voyage' episode, SUGA said that he has already produced all of the songs for his mixtape, and he will begin to arrange and record the songs after returning from the group's 'Bon Voyage' trip to New Zealand. The Bon Voyage filming ended about 1-2 months ago, so fans are speculating a release in the near future.</p>
