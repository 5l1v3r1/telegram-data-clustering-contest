      <h1>Ant Financial Aims For 2B Users But Has No IPO Plan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:32:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Chinese payments company Ant Financial has plans for the future — but going public isn’t one of them.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have any timetable for an IPO,” Douglas Feagin, president of the international business group at Ant Financial, told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/ant-financial-no-ipo-timetable-but-plans-to-acquire-more-users-outside-china.html">CNBC</a>.</p>
      <p>His comments echo those of other company executives, including CEO Eric Jing. Feagin added that the company was “very much focused on growing our business, and, frankly, there’s not a lot holding us back.” He said Ant is looking into other areas, such as providing financial services to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
      <p>But in September it was <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2019/eyeing-ipo-alibaba-gets-go-ahead-to-restructure-ant-financial/">revealed</a> that Chinese regulators had given parent company Alibaba permission to restructure Ant Financial, which would open a path for an initial public offering (IPO).</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Feagin said that the company, which operates the Alipay service, plans to boost its customer base to 2 billion over the next decade, as well as “dramatically” grow its users outside China. He noted that Ant currently has over 1.2 billion users around the world.</p>
      <p>“It’s 900 million (users) in China, 300 million outside. We see the 300 million growing dramatically outside of China,” he said. “Indeed, we have an ambition of serving 2 billion consumers over the next 10 plus years and so clearly the majority of those are going to come from outside China.”</p>
      <p>Ant also just <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2019/ant-financial-could-pursue-digital-banking-license-in-singapore/">announced</a> that it might also apply for a virtual banking license in Singapore. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is offering as many as five digital banking permits to non-banks to boost competition. While Ant didn’t reveal if it would pursue a retail or wholesale license, it will be easier for it to obtain the latter. And earlier this year, Ant’s SME Services (Hong Kong) Ltd. unit received a permit from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to operate a virtual bank in the Chinese territory, while in March it <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/digital-banking/2019/ant-financial-hoperun-platform-financial-firms/">launched</a> a banking-as-a-service platform with Jiangsu-based Hoperun Information Technology.</p>
      <p>Ant Financial is <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/international/2019/eyeing-ipo-alibaba-gets-go-ahead-to-restructure-ant-financial/">worth</a> around $150 billion, making it one of the most valuable private sector FinTech companies in the world.</p>
