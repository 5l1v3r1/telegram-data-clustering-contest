      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>This week, we saw a major downside break in Ethereum below the $180 and $178 supports against the US Dollar. ETH price even settled below the $180 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Finally, there was a break below the $175 support and the price tested the $172 area. A new monthly low was formed near $172 and the price is currently correcting higher. It surpassed the $175 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, there was a break above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $186 high to $172 low. More importantly, there was a break above a declining channel with resistance near $175 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $178 zone (the recent breakdown support area). The main resistance on the upside for Ethereum is near the $180 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $186 high to $172 low is also near the $180 area. Therefore, an upside break above the $180 resistance may perhaps decrease the current selling pressure.</p>
      <p>To move into a positive zone and start a strong rise, the price must break the $185 resistance zone and both bearish trend lines. On the downside, the $175 level could provide support.</p>
      <p>The key support is now near the recent low at $172. If there is a downside break below the $172 level, the price is likely to start another major decline towards the $166 and $160 levels in the near term.</p>
