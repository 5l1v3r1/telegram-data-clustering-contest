      <p>African Socio-cultural Harmony and Enlightenment (ASHE) Foundation, backed by paramount monarchs, led by Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has dismissed reports of Botswana being the true Garden of Eden as cultural miseducation.</p>
      <p>A statement by its President, Prince Justice Faloye, noted that the news was a continued misconception of original African cultural and genetic origins and identity, which came from wrong archaeological conclusions that Tanzania was the origin of humanity, based on the hominid findings, to genetic anthropological conclusions of Botswana. The statement added: “However, it appears this cultural misconception goes beyond religion and also has geopolitical considerations. This latest study claiming the evolution of humanity occurred in a huge lake that previously existed in Botswana overlooks a fundamental requirement that the environment should be salty marine water and have a freshwater source due to the physiological makeup of Man that includes some salts.”</p>
      <p>According to him, no other African sub region has the necessary environmental conditions, apart from Southern Nigeria with the largest continental mangrove and freshwater swamp and lowland Rainforest in Africa.</p>
      <p>Faloye, who is author of “The Blackworld: Evolution to Revolution”</p>
      <p>posits: “Unlike with the theoretical Botswana lake that can only occur within a short timeframe by stretching the 26,000 year precession of the equinox, in Nigeria for millions of years majority of the rain from the Atlantic Ocean, especially from Guinean highlands and Jos Plateau watersheds, is funneled out back to the Atlantic Ocean through Nigeria’s permanent continental freshwater and mangrove swamps. Nigeria is also the center of the Yam belt known to be the food of evolution picked in the wild by hunter gatherers. When initially suggested that Man evolved in a rainforest, due to the fact that all hominids skeletons unearthed had dental markings that showed a previous rainforest habitat, what became known as the Wild Yam question was raised that Man couldn’t have survived on Yams alone without savanna agriculture. However, it has recently been proven by the Kyoto University study (Yasuoka 2013) that Man evolved eating wild Yams.</p>

      <p>“Now, the question is what did the first humans in Botswana eat? This recent study currently trending attempts to explain the inconsistency of the genetic study conducted by Sarah Tishkoffs (2009) that came to the wrong conclusion of Botswana, which was influenced by the wrong inclusion of the nonexistent ethnic group Lemande, instead of Yoruba, to determine the site of divergence. The inclusion of Lemande to be the only group older than Yorubas among full sized Africans that speak the continuum of dialects known as the Niger Congo ethno linguistic family made the decision biased towards Central Africa; as seen in Tishkoff, Sarah A.; Reed, Floyd A.; Friedlaender et al (2009-05-22). “The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans”. Science. 324 (5930): 1035-1044.”</p>
      <p>He added that another overlooked fact is that Western Pygmies are largely mixed with Bantus, while those that migrated to South Africa were isolated and retained their age more than their West Counterparts.</p>
      <p>He writes: “If the site of ancestral origin had been based on the true oldest DNA Yoruba, it would be have clear that the nearest source of salty and freshwater was the Yoruba coast. It is agreed in the theories of Bantu migration that the Benue-Congo ethno linguistic group diverged from Taraba/Adamawa into Cameroun across Central, East and South Africa as seen in (William Croft, ed. (2005); Genetic Linguistics: Essays on Theory and Method. Oxford: Oxford University Press;  Greenberg, Joseph H. (1948). “The classification of African languages”. American Anthropologist. 50: 24-30. doi:10.1525/aa.1948.50.1.02a00050; and The Languages of Africa. Bloomington: Indiana University Press. 1963).</p>
      <p>“This Benue Congo ethno linguistic group diverged from the Volta Niger group that includes Yoruba, Igbo, Ewe, Fon, whose cultural and social organization show a coastal evolution point with only Yam at the foundation of their culture.</p>
