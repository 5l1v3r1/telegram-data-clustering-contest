      <p>The rupee (INR) gained against the dollar (USD) on Tuesday as it closed at 71.71 versus the previous close of 71.84. Until the domestic currency stays above 72, it can be approached with a bullish bias as that level is solid support. But on the upside, the gains can be limited by the resistance at 71.6. Thus, the rupee can be expected to stay within 72 and 71.6 for a while.  <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/portfolio/technical-analysis/daily-rupee-call-tread-with-caution-before-initiating-fresh-positions/article30023867.ece">Read more the technicals here</a></p>

      <h4>Broker's call: Gabriel India (Sell)</h4>
      <p>In Q2-FY20,<a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/stocks/gabriel-india-ltd/overview/"> Gabriel India</a>’s revenue declined by 12.7 per cent y-o-y to ₹472.70 crore on account of 39 per cent/27 per cent y-o-y decline in PV and CV segments. However, 2W revenue grew by 3 per cent y-o-y. Growth in two-wheeler segment was on account of increase in market share of TVS and addition of other successful models like Jawa, RE twin models and Suzuki models.</p>
      <p>PV and CV (particularly LCV, MCV and HCV) volumes decline by 50 per cent, 30 per cent and 59 per cent y-o-y, respectively. The management does not expect any major revival in the industry until BS-VI transition takes place. The export business of Gabriel was also under pressure as there was weakness in Columbia due to phasing out of old models and slowdown in Sri Lanka and Latin America which are two major export markets for the company. <a href="https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/stock-markets/brokers-call/article30018879.ece">Read more here</a></p>
