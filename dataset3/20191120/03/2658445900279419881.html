      <p>The Ubima Marginal Field in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 17 in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State has produced first oil in more than 10 years, its operators, All Grace Energy Limited, an indigenous oil firm, has said.</p>
      <p>The flag-off took place last weekend in Ubima to the excitement of oil industry stakeholders and the Chairman/CEO of the AGEL, Prof. Anthony Adegbulugbe. The well was drilled by Shell Petroleum Development Company in 1964 and later abandoned before it was awarded to All Grace Energy Limited in 2006.</p>
      <p>Oil industry sources told The Nation that Early Well Test (EWT) commenced November 14 following approval from the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), the Nigerian oil and gas industry regulator, paving the way for the commencement of operation last Friday.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, Prof Adegbulugbe expressed joy at the landmark achievement, and promised that the company would strive to achieve “the work program approved by the Joint Operation Committee (JOC) of the Joint Venture partners.” He said the work programme states that “more wells will be drilled and more efficient evacuation system will be put in place in the coming year.”</p>

      <p>He assured all stakeholders, including its host Ubima Community, River State and Nigeria would benefit from the re-opening and restart of production from the marginal field.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Leslie Ikem, Health Safety and Environment personnel, said AGEL was a joint venture with Wester Oil, saying the facility was drilled in 1964 but re-entry activities commenced in 2014. “But today (Friday) the well was opened and now the oil is flowing. This is an achievement for the JV partners.”</p>
      <p>The Project Engineer, Abiodun Demi, confirmed that first oil had been achieved from the well, but explained that due to limited storage capacity in Ubima, the company would be trucking crude to the nearby Otakikpo Marginal Field facility for export.</p>
      <p>“First oil has been achieved; basically there is limited storage on the Ubima miginal field so we are going to be trucking to (Otakikpo Marginal) Andonni LGA, operated by our sister field Green Energy.”</p>
      <p>“After trucking there storage and exportation will be done from there. It is a very big milestone and production per day is about 1,000barels and from there progress will continue. We have the drive, the personnel and (are) willing and able people to push it forward making Nigeria economy and market better.</p>
      <p>Nsika Umoren, who gave the orientation speech on the facility and HSE procedure on site, disclosed that the guiding principles on the facility is tagged ‘100’, which translates to One (1) family, zero (0) harm to people and zero (0) leaks to the environment).</p>
      <p>The Supervisor and CLO, Mr. Chidi Ishmel assured that there was nothing to fear as security at Ubima field was guarantee by good relationship between the company and the community.</p>
      <p>The Operations Superintendent, Mr. Ini Mba, from Wester Oil, the partner told our reporter that the “Ubima marginal field and the field is now live”, stressing that the flare was up and again announce the crude is dry crude after the analysis overnight.</p>
      <p>The highpoint of the event was the formal flag-off by Prof Adegbulugbe, Chairman of AGEL, after which stainless sample of the dry crude was shown to visitors and dignitaries, including directors from Wester Oil, officials of DPR and members of staff: Mrs. Amachree Bukuru, Mrs. Tobi Ogunfayo, and others.</p>
