      <h2>Earlier limit was ₹1 lakh</h2>

      <p>Amidst an Opposition boycott, the Assembly passed the Kerala Farmers Debt Relief Commission (Amendment) Bill, 2019 to include farm loans up to ₹2 lakh under the purview of the debt relief commission.</p>
      <p>Replying to the discussion on the Bill, as reported by the subject committee, on Tuesday, Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan said the decision to extend the farm loan waiver limit from the present ₹1 lakh to ₹2 lakh had been taken amidst the unprecedented flood in two consecutive years and the financial crisis facing the State exchequer.</p>
      <p>“We do not claim that all issues of the farmers had been addressed. The decision to increase the limit to ₹2 lakh is a small step as part of the farmer-friendly polices being followed by the LDF government,” the Minister said.</p>
      <h3>Debt relief</h3>
      <p>He said ₹207.85 crore had been disbursed to the farmers under the purview of the debt relief commission during the last 12 years by the successive governments.</p>
      <p>Later, the House passed the Bill by voice vote.</p>
      <p>The Bill replaces the Kerala Farmers Debt Relief Commission (Amendment) Ordinance, 2019 promulgated by the Kerala Governor in July.</p>
