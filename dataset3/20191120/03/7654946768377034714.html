      <h1>‘Jealous’ Ohio mom gets 37 years in prison for killing her 3 sons</h1>

      <p>An Ohio woman was sentenced to 37 years in prison on Tuesday for <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/08/19/mom-says-she-killed-her-sons-because-her-husband-ignored-her-daughter/">suffocating three of her boys</a> to death because she was jealous over attention they got from her husband.</p>
      <p>Brittany Pilkington received the sentence as part of a plea deal that prevented her from facing the death penalty for the three separate killings that began in July 2014. Her trial would have begun next year.</p>
      <p>The mother, who suffered “mental defects” from years of physical and sexual abuse, was arrested in August 2015 for the death of her 3-month old boy, Noah.</p>
      <p>She then admitted in an interview with prosecutors to using blankets to suffocate Noah and her two other sons — 4-year-old Gavin, who died in April 2015, and 3-month old Nial, who died in July 2014.</p>
      <p>The mother told authorities she committed the crimes because she was jealous of the attention her husband gave to her son, but not to her or their daughter, Hailey.</p>
      <p>Hailey was taken into custody by a child welfare agency following Noah’s death.</p>
      <p>Logan County Prosecutor Eric Stewart said the state’s own experts felt the death penalty wasn’t acceptable for Pilkington due to her “mental defects.”</p>
      <p>One of Pilkington’s attorneys, Kort Gatterdam, said the mother suffered lead poisoning and years of physical and sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>Following Noah’s death, Pilkington’s husband, Joseph Pilkington, was charged with sexual battery for impregnating Brittany in 2009 when she was just 17.</p>
      <p>Before his marriage to Brittany, Joseph was in a relationship with her mother.</p>
