      <p>For the second time in 24 hours, Environment Canada has issued a fog advisory for Waterloo Region and our surrounding area. </p>
      <p>The national weather agency says dense fog is expected overnight into Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>There's also a possibility we could see patchy freezing drizzle, so roadways and walkways may become hazardous.</p>
      <p>Visibility could also be greatly reduced at times, so motorists need to use caution. </p>
