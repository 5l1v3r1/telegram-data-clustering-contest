      <p>A Texas couple was sentenced to more than a decade in jail Wednesday for disposing the remains of their drowned 2-year-old in a vat of acid, a report said.</p>
      <p>Monica Dominguez, 38, received 20 years for endangering a child and abuse of a corpse for the February crime, <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/local/crime/article/Laredo-woman-found-guilty-of-dissolving-child-s-14842832.php#photo-16935872">the Laredo Morning Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She’ll also serve a 10-year sentence for violating her parole, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Gerardo Zavala-Loredo, 33 — her husband and the father of the 2-year-old — pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence of a human corpse and was sentenced to 14 years, the Morning Times reported.</p>
      <p>After their arrest,<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/19/texas-couple-accused-of-throwing-daughters-remains-in-vat-of-acid/"> Dominguez told police</a> that two of her kids were bathing and that one of them, Rebecka Zavala, drowned.</p>
      <p>The kids were not being supervised while they were bathing, she told investigators.</p>
      <p>Dominguez said she called her husband to help get rid of their daughter’s body, Webb County District Attorney Isidro “Chilo” Alaniz said at the time of the crime.</p>
      <p>Police responded to a call from a concerned neighbor and searched the couple’s apartment and found Rebecka’s remains inside a five-gallon, acid-filled container in a bedroom closet, the Morning Times reported.</p>
      <p>Child Protective Services took custody of four children, ages 1 to 11, who lived at the apartment.</p>
