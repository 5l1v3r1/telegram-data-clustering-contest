      <hr/>
      <p>Celebrity relationships are one of the most popular topics for the gossip media. The tabloids are full of stories of famous couples getting together, breaking up, cheating on each other and falling in and out of love. Of course, the tabloids love to print the most ridiculous stories they can <s>make up</s> “find,” thanks to conveniently anonymous sources who will back up any outlandish claims about A-list couples. But what about the couples that don’t break up? The ones that stand the test of time and have long, loving relationships and marriages? <b>Gossip Cop</b> put together a list of some of the most dedicated celebrity partners in Hollywood.</p>
      <h3>Julia Robert and Danny Moder</h3>

      <p>Julia Roberts and cinematographer Danny Moder’s marriage is constantly attacked by the tabloids. <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunks <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/julia-roberts-danny-moder-trips-save-marriage/">phony stories about the couple</a> almost weekly. Despite the barrage by the tabloid press, the couple’s marriage has endured and thrived for 17 years now. They’re proud parents to three children, twins born in 2004 and a son born in 2007.</p>
      <p>The couple met while filming <i>The Mexican</i> in 2000, in which Roberts starred and Moder served as an assistant cameraman. They married on the Fourth of of July, 2002 and the fireworks haven’t faded yet. Despite Roberts’ status at the top of the Hollywood A-list, the couple maintains a fairly private marriage, despite commanding huge attention from the tabloids and the paparazzi.</p>
      <h3>Beyoncé and Jay-Z</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It’s hard to believe the first couple of hip hop and pop music have been together for more than a decade now. The tabloids have <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/beyonce-jay-z-marriage-truth-divorce-rumors/">often predicted disaster</a> for Jay-Z and Beyoncé, but so far, the couple has proven those split rumors wrong – time and time again.</p>
      <p>Quietly married in 2008 after almost six years together, this music power couple has collectively sold over 300 million records. Together, they have three children and have even survived an actual bout of infidelity by Jay-Z – which Beyoncé sang about on her hit album <i>Lemonade</i>.</p>
      <h3>David and Victoria Beckham</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/david-beckham-victoria-beckham-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The tabloids have never been kind to Victoria and David Beckham, <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/victoria-beckham-david-jealousy-other-women/">often reporting fake marital problems</a> for the glamorous couple almost since the former Spice Girl and the former soccer star first starting dating more than 20 years ago. The two got married in 1999 and have since welcomed four kids into the world: their oldest son, Brooklyn, another son, Romeo, a third son, Cruz, and Harper, their youngest and only daughter.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> has corrected many stories about the couple over the years, many of which involved a tabloid incorrectly reporting on an imminent breakup. Despite the gossip media being generally <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/david-beckham-victoria-taking-kids-stop-drinking/">very harsh on the couple</a>, they’ve managed to stay together for two decades. Cheers!</p>
      <h3>Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ellen-degeneres-portia-derossi-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Talk show host extraordinaire Ellen DeGeneres has been married to actress Portia de Rossi since 2008. They were among the first same-sex couples in California to get married after the law banning same-sex marriage was overturned just a few months before their wedding. They’ve been together for a total of 15 years now.</p>
      <p>DeGeneres was one of the first major stars to proudly come out as gay in the ’90s and had a couple of high-profile relationships before settling down with de Rossi, including a three-year relationship with actress Anne Heche. She has long been <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ellen-degeneres-divorce-portia-de-rossi-adopt-baby/">the subject of some vicious attacks by the tabloids</a>, but <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-plastic-surgery-dump/">her relationship with de Rossi has endured</a>, and DeGeneres has become one of the most popular talk show hosts in the country, despite the tabloids’ attempts to tear her and her wife down.</p>
      <h3>Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Nicole Kidman’s personal life has been on public display for almost three decades now, ever since she married her first husband, Tom Cruise, in 1990. Kidman and Cruise were married for 11 years, adopting Isabella and Connor along the way, before divorcing in 2001. In the years immediately after the marriage, Kidman was attached to a number of high-profile actors in the tabloids, including Jude Law. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/31/uk.kidman.mail/index.html">Kidman sued the British tabloid <i>The Daily Mail</i></a> for libel over its false reporting on the two <i>Cold Mountain</i> co-stars and in 2003, Kidman won the case.</p>
      <p>Kidman met Keith Urban while appearing at an awards show together in January 2005. A whirlwind romance ensued and the couple got married in June 2006. Together they have two daughters, Sunday Rose, born in 2008 and Faith Margaret, born in 2010, and they split their time between their native Australia, Los Angeles, and Nashville.</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> has busted dozens of phony tabloid stories about the couple. Often, the publications use the same false narratives over and over. Two of the most popular are <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-sobriety-relapse/">Kidman “worrying” about Urban’s sobriety</a> and <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-jealous/">Kidman and Urban having jealousy issues </a>over her male co-stars and his female collaborators. The couple remains happily married, despite all the attention on their relationship.</p>
      <h3>Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kurt-russell-goldie-hawn-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Although they have never officially married, Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn have been a couple for more than 35 years and have one son together, Wyatt. Even Hawn’s children from her previous marriage to Bill Hudson, Kate Hudson and her brother Oliver, think of Russell as a father. Kate even gave her son with ex-husband Chris Robinson the middle name “Russell” in his honor.</p>
      <p>Both Russell and Hawn had been through public divorces before dating. The lessons they learned from those previous relationships no doubt helped them forge a strong bond that’s held them together through three decades. Of course, that doesn’t stop the tabloids from <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/goldie-hawn-kurt-russell-save-romance-vacation/">making up stories about an imminent breakup</a>.</p>
      <h3>Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/matthew-broderick-sarah-jessica-parker-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick are both ‘80s teen stars who have maintained amazing careers for more than 30 years. For 22 of those years, they have been a loving married couple who now have three children, including twin daughters.</p>
      <p>The tabloids, of course, have been <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/sarah-jessica-parker-matthew-broderick-separate-lives/">incorrectly predicting doom and gloom</a> for the couple for years. Parker even <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/sarah-jessica-parker-matthew-broderick-marriage-problems-tabloid-story-denial/">went so far as to call out the <i>National Enquirer</i></a> for their “annual” bad reporting on the state of her marriage. Even after two decades, the relationship continues to be strong and healthy.</p>
      <h3>Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/will-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>With 21 years of marriage in the bag, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith seem like the perfect couple. As two of the biggest stars on the planet, maintaining a private personal life is impossible for the couple and their family, but by most accounts, they live as normal a life as a Hollywood power couple can. They have two ambitious and beautiful children, son Jaden and daughter Willow, who have successful careers of their own.</p>
      <p>Of course, being huge stars, they are also often tabloid fodder as a result. Allegations of <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/will-smith-jada-pinkett-margot-robbie-cheated/">Smith’s infidelity is the most popular subject for the tabloids</a> to tell stories about, but all these years later, none of the rumors about his made-up affairs have ever turned out to be true and they haven’t weakened the couple’s relationship.</p>
      <h3>Hugh Jackman and Deborra-Lee Furness</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/hugh-jackman-deborra-lee-furness-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Hugh Jackman and his wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, met on the set of the Australian TV show <i>Correlli</i> in 1995 and married a year later. Their relationship has become one of the most enduring marriages in Hollywood, now in its 24th year! Even Jackman’s rise to superstardom after playing iconic roles like Wolverine and Jean Valjean in <i>Les Miserables</i> has not dented the couple’s private relationship. The couple has two adopted children, 19-year-old Oscar and 14-year-old Ava.</p>
      <p>Jackman and Furness generally avoid the wrath of the tabloid media and keep a low profile. In fact, <b>Gossip Cop</b> rarely has to correct wild tales about the two. In fact, the most recent story we debunked involved Jackman praising his long marriage, as it claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/nicole-kidman-hugh-jackman-keith-urban-save-marriage/">Nicole Kidman had turned to him for advice</a> in her own marriage. She hadn’t, of course, but after more than two decades of marriage, we have to admit he would be an excellent person to go to for relationship advice.</p>
      <h3>Barack and Michelle Obama</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/barack-obama-michelle-obama-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama aren’t exactly Hollywood celebrities. They made their names on a much bigger stage, but they’re still often the subject of vicious and untrue tabloid rumors. The former first family also includes their daughters, Malia, born in 1998, and her younger sister, Sasha, born in 2001. Like the royal family, the Obamas are a rare example of celebrities outside of Hollywood that get major attention in the gossip media.</p>
      <p>The stories are almost always about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/barack-obama-michelle-divorce-rumors-truth/">an impending divorce</a>, despite no indication that the couple, who have been married for 27 years, are any less in love today than they were when they wed in 1992. One of the most popular tropes the tabloids use is about the couple wearing — or not wearing — their wedding rings. <b>Gossip Cop</b> has <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/barack-obama-michelle-divorce/">busted numerous outlets for using this device</a>. President Obama has explained that he often takes off his ring as he shakes many hands over the course of the average day and worries about losing it. Unfortunately, the truth has never stopped the tabloids.</p>
      <h3>Steven Spielberg and Kate Capshaw</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/kate-capshaw-steven-spielberg-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Legendary director Steven Spielberg started dating his future wife, Kate Capshaw, when he directed her in <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom</i> in 1984. Together, the couple have four children: Sasha, Sawyer, Mikaela and Destry. Capshaw was previously married to business executive Robert Capshaw, with whom she has one daughter, <i>Grey’s Anatomy</i> star Jessica Capshaw, and one adopted son, Theo. Spielberg was married to actress Amy Irving, with whom he shares an adult son named Max.</p>
      <p>Spielberg and Capshaw have been married since 1991, and while Spielberg is one of the most powerful and popular people in Hollywood, the couple manages to keep a low profile. Here’s a rare instance of a couple who the tabloids don’t focus on very often at all.</p>
      <h3>Tom Hanks And Rita Wilson</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-cowboys-marriage.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Getty Images)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson hve been together for more than three decades, and occasionally find themselves in the midst of tabloid drama. Hanks began his career in the ’70s, starring in TV shows, but made his jump to film in 1984’s <i>Splash</i>. Hanks first met Wilson while filming his first breakout TV show, <i>Bossom Buddies</i>, and the two actors reconnected while filming <i>Volunteers</i> in 1984. The married in 1988 and together have two children.</p>
      <p>There was a period a few years back when the tabloids insisted Hanks and Wilson were splitting, but the gossip media seems to have dropped that storyline, probably because it’s so provably untrue. Instead, the actor himself is often the subject of the tabloids’ wrath. Not too long ago, <b>Gossip Cop</b> debunked a claim that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tom-hanks-meryl-streep-oscar-nomination-snub/">Hanks was angry at Meryl Streep</a> for being nominated for an Oscar for <i>The Post</i> when he wasn’t. Despite such stories, Hanks has maintained his reputation as the nicest guy in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>Often the image of a celebrity relationship is one that starts with a whirlwind romance that fades over the course of a few short years and ends in a nasty public divorce, but that’s not always the case as these couples have proven. The tabloids make so many false claims about famous couples that in the instances when they do split, those publications will pat themselves on the back for the supposed foresight. However, as the saying goes, even a broken clock is right twice a day. If the tabloids predict a split enough times, eventually the report may accidently be correct. One thing you will hardly ever see is a tabloid updating or correcting a past false report about a divorce. That’s where <b>Gossip Cop</b> steps in to correct the story.</p>
