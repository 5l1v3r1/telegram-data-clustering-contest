      <p>Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) is focusing on capacity building for conducting self or internal appraisal of the projects it is taking up so that few external agencies need be called in to do the same in future, Finance Minister, Thomas Isaac, said in the Assembly on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Countering allegations raised by the Opposition against the outsourcing of project appraisals to private firms, Mr. Isaac said that given the nature of the projects that KIIFB had taken up, it needed a heterogeneous group with expertise in various fields to appraise the projects. KIIFB had engaged Centre for Management Development (CMD) for the job and they were well within their rights to call for inputs from external agencies to help them. Terrenus Consulting Pvt Ltd. was engaged by CMD after they won the tender, Mr. Isaac said.</p>
