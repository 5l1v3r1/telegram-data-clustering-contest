      <h1>Pills, Weed, ‘Foil With Residue’ Found At Home of Redskins’ Montae Nicholson After Death of Woman</h1>

      <p>Pills, marijuana and drug paraphernalia were found in the home of Montae Nicholson following the apparent overdose death of a 21-year-old woman there.</p>
      <p>He and another man reportedly dropped the unresponsive woman off at the hospital last Thursday morning where she would soon be pronounced dead.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/19/montae-nicholson-pills-marijuana-foil-search-warrant-woman-overdose/">TMZ Sports</a> obtained the search warrant that spells out a disturbing scene at the hospital.</p>
      <blockquote>“Officials say Montae and another man rolled up to the ER in a black Nissan in the early hours of Nov. 14 — where hospital staffers “helped remove Miss Crabbe from the Nissan Armada.”<br/><br/>They add, “Hospital staff reported that Miss Crabbe appeared to be deceased during the extraction from the Nissan Armada.”<br/><br/>Officials say after Crabbe was removed, the two men “exited the area” — something Nicholson’s reps have since disputed. They claim Montae stayed at the hospital to help until her family arrived.”</blockquote>
      <p>The warrant does not identify who the drugs belong to, basically saying the items found in home does not mean he provided them to the victim.</p>
      <p>Montae has not been named a suspect and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.</p>
