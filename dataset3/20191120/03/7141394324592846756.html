      <h1>Bitcoin (BTC) Bull Anthony Pompliano Responds to President Trump’s Tweetstorm During Live Impeachment Hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:00:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Democrats looking to impeach US president Donald Trump and Republicans trying to keep him in the clear are eagerly watching the impeachment hearings in the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>The proceedings are based, in part, on an accusation from an unnamed intelligence official who says Trump may have abused his power by withholding funds to Ukraine in exchange for political favors.</p>
      <p>A House impeachment vote is scheduled for December. If Trump is impeached, a trial will be held in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who are ultimately highly unlikely to remove him from office. </p>
      <p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780540637/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-say-impeachment-hearings-wont-change-their-minds">poll</a>, 50% of Americans approve of the impeachment hearings, and only 30% say the proceedings might change their minds. Less than half or 45% say Trump should be impeached and 44% say he should not, with 11% unsure.</p>
      <p>During the live impeachment hearings, Trump set off another one of his trademark tweetstorms, boasting about the US stock market and its performance: up 27% this year.</p>
      <p>Bitcoin bull Anthony Pompliano clapped back about Bitcoin and its performance: up 122% this year.</p>

      <p>A recent <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/11/11/bitcoin-btc-poised-to-beat-sp-500-over-the-next-12-months-chainalysis-survey/">survey</a> of 350 finance pros, conducted by Chainalysis, found that 48.6% of respondents – the largest group – think Bitcoin will have the highest growth rate in the next year when compared to other investment categories like equities, fixed income bonds and housing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, crypto critics like gold proponent Peter Schiff and economist Nouriel Roubini remain steadfast and say BTC is poised to plunge into obscurity in the long run.</p>
