      <p>The global payment technology company launched the festive season campaign this week aimed at encouraging the use of either a Visa card or Visa on mobile by shoppers at various malls in the commercial capital.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Dar es Salaam, Visa Country Manager, Olive Njoroge said the campaign is also meant to cushion consumers against risks of carrying bulky cash when shopping.”We are encouraging our Tanzanian customers to shop with Visa which offers them convenience and safety as they make purchases during this Christmas season,” Njoroge said.</p>
      <p>She said the Christmas campaign by Visa also gives shoppers the opportunity to choose what kind of gift to get their loved ones in a convenient and safe manner as they purchase goods at malls.</p>
      <p>“We are bringing the Visa brand to the people as we highlight to them the benefits of shopping using a Visa card or Visa on mobile. We are proud to say that Tanzanians are now open to new ways of making payments without having cash at hand,” she added.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Visa, in collaboration with 15 banks, launched Visa on mobile which is a digital payment solution that allows consumers to send money to each other domestically without paying transaction fees.</p>
      <p>To use the service, one simply has to download their bank’s mobile application, search for Visa on the application and pay for goods and services either by scanning the QR code or by using a USSD, Njoroge noted.</p>
      <p>Visa Inc. is the world’s leader in digital payments with a mission to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure payment network - enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.</p>
      <p>“Our advanced global processing network, VisaNet, provides secure and reliable payments around the world, and is capable of handling more than 65,000 transaction messages a second,” the US based company said in a statement earlier.</p>
