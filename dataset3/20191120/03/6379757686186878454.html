      <p>British High Commissioner to Tanzania, Sarah Cooke said in Kilombero yesterday on a field visit to the factory that the anticipated expansion will allow cane farmers to increase their productions as more of the raw material will be needed to feed the expanded factory.</p>
      <p>Cooke said the UK government is eager to see that investment at the factory stays intact while benefitting the majority of the people. “The UK government has participated in two projects in Kilombero district including the construction of a 67-kilometer road to Ifakara district, as well as the process of Certification of Customery Rights of Occupants concerning land ownership,” she noted.</p>
      <p>She stressed that investments done to date at the Kilombero Sugar Company, which its partly owned by British investors, has already benefited the majority of Tanzanians in different ways including employment.</p>
      <p>Briefing the British High Commissioner, Kilombero Sugar’s Managing Director, Guy Williams said the expansion project’s study is at a good stage and that they are expecting to sign a contract with a contractors after the government and the parent company of Kilombero Sugar, reach an agreement to proceed with the project.</p>
      <p>“The total estimated Investment in such a project which will include expanding the sugar factory, new investment by surrounding small scale farmers in expanding their cane growing area and related infrastructure will amount to around U$300 million,” Williams said.</p>
      <p>Williams further assured Kilombero cane farmers that if the project is approved by both the government and Illovo Sugar Africa on time, the expansion of the factory will be completed and start operations by June 2022.</p>
      <p>“This will go hand in hand with President John Magufuli’s intention of having the country produce enough sugar for its own consumption requirements,” he added.</p>
      <p>Presenting their challenges to HC Cooke, Kilombero cane farmers said among their major challenges include poor roads heading to farms but expressed their gratitude to Kilombero Sugar Company for increasing the number of agricultural extension officers who are helping to practice better crop husbandry practices.</p>
      <p>The company’s Head of Corporate Affairs, Joseph Rugaimukamu said the expansion of the sugar factory will entice development in Kilombero district especially among cane farmers who include those from Kilosa as they will increase their earnings.</p>
