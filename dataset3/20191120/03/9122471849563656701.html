      <h1>ESPN Analyst: Penn State Has No Chance vs. Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:25:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier tonight, the College Football Playoff rankings were released. Two undefeated teams lost their first games of the season, resulting in a jump up for one Big Ten program.</p>
      <p>Minnesota’s loss to Iowa helped the team the Gophers beat just two weeks ago. Penn State jumped up to No. 8 from No. 9 after the Gophers dropped down to No. 10.</p>
      <p>After the rankings were released, ESPN’s panel of college football experts broke down a major game coming up this weekend. No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in the biggest game of the Big Ten season to date.</p>
      <p>David Pollack made it clear Ohio State will win on Saturday for one reason – Chase Young is back, per <a href="https://247sports.com/Article/Chase-Young-Ohio-State-Buckeyes-Penn-State-ESPN-Kirk-Herbstreit-Ryan-Day-138886614/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Penn State had one chance and that [Chase Young] suspension went out the window last week. If he was suspended for this game, they would’ve had a chance. If you look at Penn State, this is a team that’s kind of leaking oil, lost some of that luster they’ve had during the regular season. Offensive line is their weakest part of their offensive unit period. I don’t know how they slow him down. He’s going to get his.”</blockquote>
      <p>Not many teams have contained Young over the past two seasons. He’s second in the nation in sacks despite not playing in the past two games.</p>
      <p>With Young back on the field, Ohio State enters as an 18-point favorite.</p>
      <p>Do the Nittany Lions stand a chance?</p>
