      <h2>Despite the extension, company insists it is still being mistreated</h2>

      <p>The Trump administration has granted Huawei another 90-day extension that allows it to trade with some US companies as it weathers its US trade ban. Despite American fears over Huawei’s ties to the Chinese government, the exemption period allows Huawei to trade with some, but not all, of its US partners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778181-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Ftech-industry%2Fhuawei-gets-another-90-day-us-license-extension-3778181%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2Fus-usa-china-huawei-tech%2Fu-s-grants-huawei-new-90-day-license-extension-idUSKBN1XS21V">Reuters</a> said the extension, which is not the first, was to “minimise disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.”</p>
      <p>But Huawei has said that the extension does not ultimately benefit the company, with a spokesperson telling Reuters, “This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly”.</p>
      <p>“This has done significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business,” they added.</p>
      <p>Further to this sentiment, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said “We urge the U.S. to stop abusing export controls to discriminate against the firms of another country in the name of national security, and to stop politicizing a trade problem.”</p>
      <p>Huawei has in recent years grown to one of the largest smartphone manufacturers in the world but was first a network equipment provider. Both these businesses are suffering – in the US you can’t even buy a Huawei phone, and in the UK its latest handsets are going on sale without access to Google apps and services.</p>
