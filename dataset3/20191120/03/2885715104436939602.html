      <h1>‘Want to thank him’: Congress MLA blows flying kiss to Speaker in Odisha Assembly</h1>
      <h2>The Congress MLA clarified that he did not mean to insult the Speaker and that the gesture was a mark of gratitude towards him.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T03:55:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 03:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Congress MLA Taraprasad Bahinipati evoked peals of laughter in the Assembly on Tuesday when he blew a flying kiss to Speaker S N Patro after being allowed to raise issues faced by his constituency.</p>
      <p>The Jeypore MLA, who was the first to ask questions in the House, clarified that he did not mean to insult Patro and that the gesture was a mark of gratitude towards the speaker.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to thank the Speaker. The flying kiss was a mark of my appreciation for him as he showed concern for the backward areas in my constituencies. I am indebted to the Speaker for giving me the opportunity among the 147 members of the House to raise the first question,” Bahinipati told reporters outside the Assembly.</p>
      <p>Among other issues, the MLA drew the government’s attention to the drinking water problems in his constituency.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker had last week raised eyebrows when he approached Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/naveen-patnaik/">Naveen Patnaik</a> on the first day of the winter session and asked, “Apana Khusi Ta? (Sir, Are you happy?)”</p>
      <p>Patnaik had promptly responded, saying “Mu Bahut Khushi. (I am very happy)”</p>
      <p>The BJD president, during his election campaigns earlier this year, often asked voters if they were happy. The phrase has gained such popularity in the state that T-shirts with ‘Apana Khusi ta’ written on them are being sold online</p>
