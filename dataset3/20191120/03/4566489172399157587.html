      <p>Setting foot in a powerful Buddhist kingdom more than three centuries ago, fearless European missionaries built a church on the banks of a river -- the birthplace of a Catholic community in Thailand which eagerly awaits the arrival of Pope Francis on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>About an hour's drive from Bangkok, Ayutthaya is now a sleepy town of mostly Buddhist ruins and backpackers but in the past it was a vibrant, cosmopolitan city seen as a diplomatic meeting point between east and west.</p>
      <p>That made it possible for Rome to establish the "Mission de Siam" 350 years ago at a time when missionary work in Asia was dangerous and viewed with deep suspicion.</p>
      <p>"This church is considered the heart of Catholicism in Thailand," said Father Tweesak Kitcharoen after a recent mass at St. Joseph's.</p>
      <p>A Catholic holdout in a sea of Buddhist temples, the mission survived hardship, occasional hostility and war.</p>
      <p>The original church was built around 1666, according to Tweesak, but it was deemed too small.</p>
      <p>A second model was burned down when armies from Burma sacked the city in 1767, and it was rebuilt two more times.</p>

      <p>The Catholic community there held on even after the capital was moved to Bangkok in the late 18th century.</p>
      <p>Singing hymns in Thai and kneeling in prayer, the 100 or so congregants who attend Sunday services at St. Joseph's are part of Thailand's 380,000-strong Catholic community, roughly 0.5 percent of the population.</p>
      <p>They are fired up in anticipation of Francis's first visit, which aims to mark the anniversary while highlighting religious harmony.</p>
      <p>"I've only seen him on TV and I can't believe that I will finally have the chance to meet him," said Prathuang Boonkong, 62, who plans on attending a stadium mass led by the pope.</p>
      <p>- 'Role model' -</p>
      <p>The church, which is painted yellow and rises up off land by the river, is proud of its historic role in spreading the faith.</p>
      <p>In a surrounding garden it has even erected a model of the boat that brought missionaries from Europe.</p>

      <p>A statue on the grounds represents Bishop Pierre Lambert de la Motte, who is thought to have requested the land from King Narai.</p>
      <p>The early arrivals encountered some initial hostility from local residents, who would also later associate Catholicism with French colonial efforts in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>But they did not face the same pushback as they did in Japan -- the next stop on Francis's itinerary after Thailand.</p>
      <p>There, missionaries were expelled and local adherents forced to renounce the faith.</p>
      <p>In a message home from Thailand, de la Motte wrote he had "never seen any land" with different religions living in such harmony, said local historian Puttipong Puttansri.</p>
      <p>Before his trip Francis sent a video message to the Thai people in which he said he hoped to "strengthen ties of friendship" with Buddhists.</p>
      <p>While here he will meet the country's king, prime minister and supreme patriarch of the majority Buddhist community.</p>

      <p>The visit has stirred excitement among the faithful, who have not had a visit by a pontiff since the late Pope John Paul II in 1984.</p>
      <p>Many will attend at least one of his two masses, while others will be able to watch livestreams of the events.</p>
      <p>Francis is a "role model" for Kaiwut Patthamasuthian, a 25-year-old who attends St. Joseph's church.</p>
      <p>"Not only does he teach us, but he also shows us how he lives his life in a humble way," he said.</p>
