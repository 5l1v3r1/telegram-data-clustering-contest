      <p>Huawei Mate X Repair Prices Announced: $1000 For Screen Replacement<br/>4.2 (84%) 5 votes</p>
      <p>A few years ago when the manufacturers began making full-screen smartphones and replacing metal and plastic back panels with glass and ceramics, many were scared of the repair price. Not accidentally, if you have to repair such a handset, it would cost you a fortune. Now, when we are entering the era of folding screen smartphones, it’s logical to see a familiar picture. <a href="https://tech.sina.com.cn/mobile/n/n/2019-11-20/doc-iihnzahi2083260.shtml">Today</a>, Huawei officially announced the repair price of Huawei Mate X (protection or man-made damage).</p>

      <p>It turns out the company’s service centers will charge from you 278 yuan ($40) for battery replacement, 7,080 yuan ($1,000) for screen replacement/repair, 3,579 yuan ($509) for motherboard replacement/repair, 361 yuan ($51) for battery cover replacement/repair, and 698 yuan ($99) for rear camera replacement/repair.</p>

      <p>If you think these maintenance prices are too high, just recall its original price of 16,999 yuan ($2,403). And if you think this phone is overpriced, just get acquainted with its selling points.</p>
      <p>As said, the Huawei Mate X uses a flexible folding screen. The latter adopts an eagle-wing folding technology that can reach up to 8 inches when unfolded. But if you don’t need a large screen, you can fold it, turning the phone into a 6.6-inch handset. So the single-hand operations will be realized more easily. And the other screen size is 6.38 inches. The thickness of the body is only 5.4mm.</p>
      <p>As for the core configuration, the Huawei Mate X is equipped with the company’s first 7nm 5G multimode chip Barong 5000 + Kirin 980. The subsequent batches have been upgraded to Kirin 990 5G. The phone also supports a 55W super-fast charge. Thus, it can charge to 85% in 30 minutes. And take into account that it is packed with a 4500mAh battery.</p>
