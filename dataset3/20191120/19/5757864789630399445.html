      <p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49561/35-things-you-might-not-know-about-mister-rogers">Fred Rogers</a> didn't watch television until his senior year of college, and when he finally did, he hated it. He told Karen Herman during a <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/31389/mister-rogers-epic-9-part-45-hour-interview">1999 interview</a> for the <a href="https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/interviews/fred-rogers?clip=48375#interview-clips">Archive of American Television</a>, “I saw people throwing pies in each other’s faces. And I thought this could be a wonderful tool for education. Why is it being used this way?”</p>
      <p>Interested in helping the medium fulfill its potential, he told his parents he would be postponing his prior plan of becoming a minister to pursue a career in television. Despite their initial protests, he forged on, eventually becoming a household name as the creator and star of <i>Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood</i>, which would stay on the air for nearly 30 years and help change the perception of what children's television could (and should) be.</p>
      <p>On November 22, 2019, <a href="https://www.abeautifulday.movie/?hs308=search&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-Mu1k-TJ5QIVQ18NCh06IgCqEAAYASAAEgLiuvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"><i>A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood</i></a> will premiere in theaters, with Tom Hanks taking on the iconic role of Mister Rogers and Matthew Rhys playing a cynical reporter named Lloyd Vogel who is tasked with writing a profile on the wholesome TV star. The film takes a look at the life of Rogers and the impact he had on viewers and the people around him.</p>
      <p>So, in anticipation of the film, and with the holidays on the horizon, here are some unique gifts you can pick up for the Mister Rogers fan in your life.</p>
