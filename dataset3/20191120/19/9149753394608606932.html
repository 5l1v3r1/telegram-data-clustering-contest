      <h1>Score one of these budget gaming laptops from Dell for $800, while stocks last</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:28:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jorge-jimenez/" target="_blank">Jorge Jimenez</a></address>
      <p>Dell's got a great deal on a couple of budget gaming laptops for $800. We found this <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/3byu">Dell G3 15 gaming laptop is on sale</a> for <b>$800</b>, $300 in instant savings and an extra $50 with a coupon, along with a <a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/productdetail/3iky">Dell G7 15 gaming laptop</a> for the same price. </p>
      <p>This G3 15 gaming laptop has got a 9th Gen i5-9300H CPU, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD storage and it's powered by a GTX 1660 Ti GPU. Not a bad build if you're looking to play most games on medium presets. We would have loved to at least 16GB of RAM, but for $800 it's not a bad laptop for a student gamer with a smaller budget to work with.  </p>
      <p>The G7 15 laptop is a bit of an older laptop with an 8th Gen i7-8750H, 16GB RAM, with 128GB SSD and 1 TB HDD storage. Its got a GTX 1060 graphics card, which is a little out of date, but still powerful enough for most games. This would be a better choice if you plan on doing more work than play, with the extra RAM and storage space making a difference. </p>
      <p>With all the money you saved you should consider looking at some of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-gaming-mouse/">best gaming mice</a> to go with your new laptop or even a premium <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-headset/">gaming headset. </a></p>
      <p>Dell has been killing it with its pre-Black Friday deals, and there will be more goodies coming later next week too.
