      <h1>US high-performance coach Dawn Scott switches to England Women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:57:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-whyatt/" target="_blank">Katie Whyatt</a></address>
      <p>Phil Neville has persuaded Dawn Scott, the United States high-performance coach, to join the England Women set-up.</p>
      <p>Scott, who has been made senior physical performance manager, has worked with US Soccer since 2010 – covering a period that has taken in two World Cup wins. She previously spent nine years as the Football Association head of sports science, during which time England Women reached the final of Euro 2009.​</p>
      <p>With North East-born Scott due to begin work at St George’s Park next month, her first assignment will be the SheBelieves Cup in the US in February as part of the Lionesses’ preparations for the European Championships in 2021, which will be played in England. More broadly, Scott will increase dialogue around fitness, performance and testing between the senior England team and the 12 Women’s Super League sides.​</p>
      <p>Head coach Neville said: “I am delighted we have secured Dawn’s services as she has worked and succeeded at the elite level and knows what it takes to win on the world stage.​</p>
      <p>“She will work closely with my coaching staff and I know the players will be looking forward to getting started with Dawn. With our run to the World Cup semi-finals, this has been a positive year, but we still have much work to do to get to the next level.”​ ​</p>

      <p>The FA’s head of women’s football, Baroness Sue Campbell, said: “We know the areas of our game we need to improve in order to be ready to win ahead of the Euro 2021. Securing Dawn’s services is a positive step in that direction and we welcome her back to the FA. She has played a central role in the success of the USA women’s team and we know that she will bring great insight and expertise to our team.”</p>
