      <h1>‘It’ Writer Gary Dauberman Still Thinks Pennywise Spinoffs Are a Possibility</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:24:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema released<b><i> It: Chapter Two</i></b> with more than double the budget and a whole lot of hype. Unfortunately, the sequel underperformed and ended its box office run with $466M worldwide, a quarter of a billion <i>less than</i> its predecessor. Still, the second half of the<b> Stephen King</b> adaptation was a financial success for the studio, enough so that doors haven’t been completely shut on another film – it just may require a tighter budget and some much needed time to breathe.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons critics turned on the film was because it failed to offer anything new, completely shying away from exploring Pennywise’s history. It was an odd choice, considering how much of the demonic clown’s history was teased, but the filmmakers decided that less was more and that would be that.</p>
      <p>Bloody Disgusting wondered about the lack of mythology and, prior to<i> It: Chapter Two</i>‘s release, asked writer <b>Gary Dauberman</b> if there were any plans for spinoffs.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure there’s interest but I gotta say,” Dauberman told us <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/interviews/3568812/exclusive-gary-dauberman-possibility-spin-offs/">back in June</a>. <b>“We want to be respectful to the material of the book</b>. I don’t think anybody’s over there, in fact <i>I know</i> there’s no one over there going ‘Hey, let’s definitely do this and we could tell this story of what happened at the beaver trapping camp,’ or whatever.”</p>
      <p>Dauberman was referring to the extensive history of Pennywise the Clown, which goes back at least as far as colonial America, where the town of Derry, Maine started out as a camp for trappers.</p>
      <p>“While you could [tell that story], and I think it would be cool, I don’t think that’s what people are doing currently,” he told us. “So yes…<b>I think there is room to build on the mythology</b> of It because It has been around from the beginning of time, <b>but I don’t know if there are any plans for it.”</b></p>
      <p>Digressing, <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/it-chapter-two-writer-gary-dauberman-talks-spinoff-possibilities-and-that-rumored-supercut-exclusive-a171703">CBM</a> once again asked about the possibility of a spinoff.</p>
      <p>“<b>I do think it’s possible</b>,” Dauberman told the site. “Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me but there’s only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. <b>There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie</b>. It’s just a question of whether or not people want to see it but I do think It was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that’s a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell and I think you could do that for sure.”</p>
      <p>Echoing what he already told Bloody Disgusting, there’s a huge gap of time in which Pennywise’s origins could be explored. While he didn’t shoot down the possibilities of another chapter, I do think it’s going to be quite some time before Pennywise scares audiences once again.</p>
