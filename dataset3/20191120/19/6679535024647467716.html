      <p>Tribals in Odisha’s Koraput district allegedly closed the gate of the Machkund hydroelectricity project on Wednesday disrupting its power generation.</p>
      <p>According to sources, three out of the project’s six turbines could not run as water flow in the power channel was affected. The tribals were protesting against the alleged privatisation of the project’s hospital at Ankadeli in Koraput district. They are also demanding better amenities and free treatment.</p>
      <p>The protesters are from Ankadeli, Chikenput and Badigada panchayats under Lamtaput block of Koraput district and Badadural, Mudulipada, Andrahal, Markapadar panchayats of Malkangiri district. These panchayats are on the periphery of the reservoir of the Machkund project.</p>
      <p>Ankadeli sarpanch Jagannath Hantal said they have been protesting against the decision to privatise the hospital for the past one year. Hundreds of tribals took out a rally and held demonstration in front of the office of the project’s assistant engineer. “When no officials came for talks with us, the protesters entered the project area and downed its shutter gate,” said Mr. Hantal.</p>
      <p>According to the protesters, government doctors and pharmacists were posted at the hospital. “They were withdrawn when it was decided to privatise the hospital and a private organisation was recently entrusted with its management,” said Mr. Hantal.</p>
      <p>The first round of talks between the protesters and the project authorities held later in the evening failed. The impasse continued till 7.30 p.m. as the second round of talks were on.</p>
      <p>Machkund hydroelectricity project was jointly established by Odisha and Andhra Pradesh on the Machkund river, a tributary of river Godavari, and commissioned in 1955. This six-unit station has generation capaciy of over 110 mW. It is jointly managed by the Odisha Hydropower Generation Corporation and the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation. As per an agreement in 2008, power generated is equally shared between the two States.</p>
