        <b>Well-known Dublin criminal Martin 'The Viper' Foley has been ordered to pay over €738,000 in unpaid tax and interest payments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It comes after the 66-year-old failed to convince the Court of Appeal that the proceedings taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) were unfair.</p>
      <p>Foley, a one-time associate of notorious criminal Martin Cahill, has 40 criminal convictions and has survived several attempts on his life down through the years.</p>
      <p>He put forward a number of grounds of appeal - including his claim that the delay in bringing proceedings resulted in his bill being unnecessarily high.</p>
      <p>On that point, the court ruled that he well knew he had an unpaid bill for taxes and that interest was accruing.</p>
      <p>The judges said he had no basis for believing the taxes would not be pursued and could have stopped the "interest clock" from running.</p>
      <p>In dismissing his appeal, Mr Justice John Edwards said a citizen's obligation to pay taxes and to do so in a timely manner is common knowledge.</p>
