      <h1>Urban Meyer Previews Saturday’s Ohio State-Penn State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:55:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Saturday afternoon, arguably the biggest game of the Big Ten season kicks off from Columbus.</p>
      <p>No. 2 Ohio State hosts No. 8 Penn State in a contest with major College Football Playoff implications. Both teams control their destiny and will likely represent the Big Ten East in the conference title game with a win.</p>
      <p>Before the game kicks off, former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer previewed the game. During the preview, Meyer said something that could have been taken as a shot at Penn State.</p>
      <p>He mentioned that Ohio State has become Penn State’s rival, but that the Nittany Lions aren’t the Buckeyes’ rival. <a href="https://twitter.com/CoachUrbanMeyer/status/1196973434854612992">Here’s what he had to say</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“The Penn State-Ohio State rivalry is one that, for the last seven years that I’ve been around has been extremely intense. Even though it’s not our (Ohio State’s) rivalry, it’s – from everything I understand – we’ve become their rival. Great programs, especially the last two years and this will be the third-straight year that it’s top-10 teams.”</blockquote>
      <p>Michigan is the clear rival for Ohio State.</p>
      <p>However, the Wolverines haven’t had any success against the Buckeyes in recent memory. The past three games between Ohio State and Penn State were separated by just five points. Ohio State has won each of the last two meetings by just one point.</p>
