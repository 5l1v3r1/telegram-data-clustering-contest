      <p>AMSTERDAM: Dutch technology company Prosus NV on Wednesday urged shareholders of Britain's Just Eat PLC to accept its unsolicited 4.9 billion pound (US$6.3 billion) cash bid for the company by Dec. 10, and spurn an alternative offer as too risky.</p>
      <p>"We believe that the Takeaway.com offer underestimates the substantial investment required in Just Eat to recapture market share and improve performance," Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk said in a statement of the rival proposal.</p>
