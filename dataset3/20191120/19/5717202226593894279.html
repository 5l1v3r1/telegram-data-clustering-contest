      <h1>How will Jack Clarke’s future be impacted by events at Tottenham Hotspur?</h1>
      <h2>Leeds United sold Clarke to Tottenham in the summer but he was immediately loaned back.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:45:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have sacked Mauricio Pochettino. After a poor start to the new season, it appears the Argentine’s relationship with the club had become untenable and he will now be looking for a new opportunity. </p>
      <p>So what does it all mean for one current Leeds United loanee?</p>
      <p>Jack Clarke joined Tottenham from Leeds in the summer. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/30/jack-clarke-tottenham-leeds-united-mauricio-pochettino-ryan-sessegnon">As reported by The Guardian</a>, Spurs paid an initial £10 million for the player before loaning him back to the West Yorkshire club to continue his development. </p>
      <p>It has not worked out for Clarke, with Marcelo Bielsa instead choosing to use other loanees instead of Clarke who has not played a single minute of Championship football this campaign. </p>

      <p>Tottenham have a recall option in the loan deal and it is widely expected that will be activated, considering his lack of action at Elland Road. </p>
      <p>But with Pochettino gone, does it mean Clarke’s Tottenham future is in jeopardy. </p>
      <p>It is hard to say.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10006539/mauricio-pochdettino-spurs-slump-tottenham-daniel-levy-blame/amp/"> As reported by The Sun,</a> Pochettino was perhaps not behind the Clarke signing. They state it was more chairman Daniel Levy’s idea. </p>
      <p>Pochettino, <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/news/pochettino-transfers-meal-jack-clarke-17103565">when speaking about Clarke in October as reported by Football.London, </a>suggested that the Leeds loanee was not currently ready to have an impact in the Tottenham first-team. So perhaps the Argentine’s exit could be good for Clarke.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“Jack Clarke is at Leeds now. He is playing for Leeds. He is our player but he is on loan. Of course, if you say to me today about Jack Clarke, I don’t know because today he has not got a place to come with us. What is going to happen in a few months, I don’t know.</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <b>“Of course I have all the reports every week but I cannot be focusing on what is going to happen with him in January. I need to be trying to help my players and the team today because we need to win on Saturday and on Tuesday. It is wasting time, with all my respect to Jack Clarke.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But Pochettino has been replaced by Jose Mourinho, who does not exactly have a top record when it comes to bringing through young players. </p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss has <a href="https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/1197198299922620422">told the Tottenham website</a> he is looking to develop young talent at Spurs and he could easily take a liking to Clarke if recalled in January. But in terms of Mourinho’s track record in England, only Scott McTominay could probably be considered a player who was pushed by the Portuguese. Plenty of others were perhaps held back, with Mourinho always more likely to go with an experienced player instead. It could be Clarke has gone from the frying pan with Pochettino, into the fire with Mourinho, when he finally does return to Spurs.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, it promises to be a potentially hectic time for Clarke in January.</p>
