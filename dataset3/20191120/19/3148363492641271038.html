      <h1>Amb. Sondland: Trump's July 26 Call Mostly Focused on Freeing A$AP Rocky, Not Ukraine Military Aid</h1>
      <h2>WASHINGTON (AP) — Ambassador Gordon Sondland says a July cellphone call with President Donald Trump “primarily discussed” rapper <a href="https://apnews.com/605da97af4dc4e9f93e2fe4c47c3ce93">A$AP Rocky, who was imprisoned in Sweden earlier this year.</a></h2>

      <p>Sondland told a <a href="https://apnews.com/Trumpimpeachmentinquiry">House impeachment inquiry</a> into Trump on Wednesday that testimony from U.S. diplomat David Holmes had jogged his memory of the discussion.</p>
      <p>Sondland says his July 26 call with Trump from a Kyiv restaurant mainly focused on the rapper, instead of Ukraine military aid. At the time, the rapper was in a Swedish jail awaiting trial on charges stemming from a June 30 street brawl in Stockholm.</p>
      <p>Holmes previously testified behind closed doors that he overhead Sondland tell Trump that the president should let Rocky “get sentenced, play the racism card, and give him a ticker-tape when he comes home.”</p>
      <p>Trump publicly weighed in to support the Grammy-nominated rapper, who pleaded self-defense. The rapper, along with his two bodyguards, on Aug. 14 were given “conditional sentences,” meaning they wouldn’t serve prison time unless they commit a similar offense the in the future.</p>
      <p>Among those urging Trump to try to free the rapper were <a href="https://apnews.com/29e502f137f54f9aba0e14877880cd83">first lady Melania Trump, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.</a></p>
      <p>Holmes testified that in the president’s phone call with Sondland, Sondland told Trump that Sweden “should have released (Rocky) on your word” but he could “tell the Kardashians you tried.”</p>
