      <p>West Ham United lit the fire ahead of the weekend Premier League game with Tottenham Hotspur, by posting a cheeky Tweet about Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The north Londoners stunned the footballing world by sacking Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night, and replacing him with the Portuguese early Wednesday morning.</p>

      <p>The 56-year-old has been out of work since December 2018 after getting the chop from Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy has acted ruthlessly and swiftly, and Mourinho has already taken training ahead of the weekend clash with the Hammers.</p>
      <p>The club’s social media team appear to be particularly excited about facing off against the tactician, and put together a short montage of his struggles against the Hammers in recent years, along with the caption ‘See you Saturday, Jose’.</p>
      <p>The Tweet has since been deleted by the club, but can be viewed <a href="https://twitter.com/Likomonio/status/1197173296850178048">via user @Likomonio</a>, and includes highlights of last season’s stunning 3-1 win over Mourinho’s Manchester United.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>It would seem that the Tweet struck completely the wrong tone, with many fans fearful about a potential defeat on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The fact West Ham are winless in six games is perhaps another reason the Tweet was eventually deleted.</p>
      <p>The Tweet may now be gone from the West Ham feed, but the internet never forgets, and Spurs fans will be waiting with their screenshots should Mourinho get his first win.</p>
