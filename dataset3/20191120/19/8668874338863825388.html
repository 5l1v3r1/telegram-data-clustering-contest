      <h1>Dave Rennie: 'With the teams I coach, it's a high-skill, high-speed type of game'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:53:29+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>He rejected the chance to coach the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> and now Dave Rennie is hoping to win over sceptical Wallabies fans with “high-octane” and “brutal” rugby.</p>
      <p>Rennie is the first to admit he may not be the most popular choice to succeed Michael Cheika after being appointed the Wallabies’ second-ever foreign-born coach following Robbie Deans’ reign from 2008 to 2013.</p>
      <p>And he’s another Kiwi no less, born and raised in the country of Australia’s fiercest and greatest rugby foes.</p>
      <p>“I get it. I think Australians want their national team coached by an Australian,” Rennie said following his appointment through to the 2023 World Cup in France.</p>
      <p>“I’m okay with that. I know they care about their team.</p>

      <p>“All I can say is that everywhere I’ve gone I’ve immersed myself in the community and culture.</p>
      <p>“I guess we’ll be judged by what we do, not what I say now but I assure you I care about the future of Australian rugby.”</p>
      <p>So much so, seemingly, the 55-year-old who transformed the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> from under-achieving entertainers into back-to-back <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> champions in 2013 will be licensed to coach the Wallabies to play “the Australian way”.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pretty competitive sporting landscape here. I think Australians want to see Australians play attacking rugby or a brand that is attractive,” said RA’s director of rugby Scott Johnson</p>
      <p>“But it’s got to be successful. It just can’t be willy nilly. It’s got to have method to it. He brings that too.”</p>

      <p>AAP put it to Johnson that Cheika was widely criticised for his dogged determination to also play attacking rugby come what may.</p>
      <p>“He’s had success here playing the same game, so it’s a fickle world,” Johnson said of Cheika.</p>
      <p>“He won <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> playing a very attractive style of rugby and he deserves a lot of credit for what he’s done in Australian rugby.</p>
      <p>“It’s no coincidence that the sides that kick the most seem to have a bit of success. It’s not just kicking, it’s judicious kicking, trying to make the game a little bit unstructured that suits us as well.</p>
      <p>“It’s finding the balance between when to kick, how to kick and why to kick and running the ball – that’s the balance.</p>
      <p>“Cheik went out in a way, fair credit to him, that was his philosophy. He wanted to play that way and I’m all for any coach that has a philosophy that says this is what I’m going to live or die by.</p>
      <p>“It shows great courage to do it.”</p>

      <p>Rennie, a former school teacher and bar owner, now coaches the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> Warriors in the Pro14.</p>
      <p>“With the teams I coach, it’s a high-skill, high-speed type of game hopefully mixed with some rugby smarts and a bit of brutality,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There’s a positive mindset to play mixed with a sharp kicking game.”</p>
      <p>Rennie had been sounded out to take over from Steve Hansen as All Blacks coach.</p>
      <p>“The big thing was I’d been talking to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> for a lot of months and the interest from the All Blacks came late in the piece,” he said.</p>
      <p>“By that stage, we’d done a lot of homework and were really excited about coming to Australia so it ended up an easy decision.”</p>
