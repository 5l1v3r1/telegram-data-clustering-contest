      <h2>Jose Mourinho began life as Tottenham Hotspur manager on Wednesday and will look to build on Mauricio Pochettino's work by bringing trophies to the club</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> began life as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager by holding talks with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/harry-kane">Harry Kane,</a> outlining what he wasts from the striker who will be key to his hopes of bringing silverware to the club.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was announced as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor at 6:30am, following the Argentine’s sacking on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday afternoon he took his first training session at Hotspur Way, after it was moved from the morning so that the Portuguese could get down to work with as many of his international stars as possible - including Wales defender Ben Davies and Belgium pair Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, ahead of Saturday's London derby against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> .</p>
      <p>Mourinho now sets about turning around a side who haven’t won away from home in the Premier League since January, and who sit 14th in the table with just three league wins so far this season.</p>

      <p>Mourinho held talks with club staff and individual senior players at the Enfield base, including Kane, whose future had recently been called into question.</p>
      <p>The England captain, 26, has won a number of individual accolades with the club, but only has runners-up medals in the League Cup and Champions League to show on a collective basis.</p>
      <p>He is now desperate to win silverware, making clear in an interview with the <i>BBC</i> in September that “it was time to turn the close margins into trophies and find a way to do it - there aren’t any excuses about being young any more.”</p>

      <p>Amid this season’s early season struggles there had been suggestions that he had begun to think about potentially leaving North London.</p>
      <p>But Spurs chief Daniel Levy is determined to keep Kane and moving from Pochettino to Mourinho, placing the club firmly into 'win-now' mode, he has decided is his best bet.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Mourinho has made clear that he believes he can satisfy Kane, shedding the club’s tag of nearly men, and end an 11-year trophy drought.</p>

      <p>In his opening interview with <i>Spurs TV,</i> Mourinho declared: “What can I promise? Passion - for my job, but also passion for my club. It’s a privilege when a manager goes to a club and feels that happiness in relation to the squad he is going to have.</p>
      <p>“These are not words of the moment. They are not words of me being the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> head coach. These are words that I’ve told and I’ve repeated in the last three, four, five years, even as an opponent.</p>
      <p>“To play against Tottenham at White Hart Lane was always hard, but beautiful. It was one of these places where I used to go with passion, but also with respect.</p>
      <p>“I always told about the club’s potential. I always told about the qualities of the players. I always told of the magnificent work the club was doing.</p>

      <p>"In relation to the Premier League we know where we are and we know that we don't belong there. We should just play match after match, the next match we want to win and that's the same about the next, and the next, and the next until the last.</p>
      <p>"At the end of the season we will see where we are but i know we are going to be in a different position to where we are now.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to the challenge, to the responsibility to bring happiness to everyone that loves the club.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has a number of issues that he must deal with in the short-term, not least figuring out what the likes of Christian Eriksen, Vertonghen and Alderweireld - the three stars out of contract next summer - are now feeling about their own futures.</p>
      <p>There is also the question of how to get the best out of Dele Alli, who has struggled to find his best form and has lost his England place after often sacrificing himself in a deeper midfield role last term.</p>
