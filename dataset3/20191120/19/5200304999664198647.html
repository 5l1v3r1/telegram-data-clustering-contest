      <p>SS Rajamouli’s search for a Caucasian, preferably a British actress, to play a key role in his upcoming movie, ‘RRR,’ has not been a secret affair. However, reports say that the search has now ended.</p>
      <p>The star chosen is Irish actress Alison Doody. She made her big screen debut in the James Bond film, ‘A View To A Kill’ (1985). She has also had the privilege to star alongside Harrison Ford and Michael Caine during her career, reports <i>Bollywood Hungama.</i></p>
      <p>Eyebrows have been raised in Rajamouli’s casting choice with Doody starring opposite N. T. Rama Rao Jr, who is younger at 36 years to Doody’s 53. Perhaps securing well known names from British cinema to be part of Indian films is a tough task. Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and Ashutosh Gowariker had to make do with the unknown Alice Patten and Rachel Shelley for Aamir Khan in ‘Rang De Basanti’ (2006) and ‘Lagaan’ (2001), respectively.</p>
      <p>‘RRR’ is due for release on 30th July next year.</p>
