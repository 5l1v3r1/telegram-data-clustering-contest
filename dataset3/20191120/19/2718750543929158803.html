      <p>Former <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/how-to-get-snl-tickets-saturday-night-live.html"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a><i> </i>cast member and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/will-ferrell-big-money-players-comedy-podcast-network.html">soon-to-be comedy-podcast tycoon</a> <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/will-ferrell-big-money-players-comedy-podcast-network.html">Will Ferrell</a> returns to the show this weekend to host <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/will-ferrell-snl-host-november.html">and join the Five-Timers Club</a>, where he’ll be accompanied by first-time musical guest <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/king-princess-cheap-queen.html">King Princess</a>. The show released the first promo for the episode today, in which Ferrell finally digs up some treasure he buried on the Studio 8H stage back during his cast-member days … only to discover, with some help from Beck Bennett, that he has no idea how investing money even works. “You only buried $500?” Bennett asks. “No, I invested this here in 1995. I thought it would’ve tripled by now.” Thankfully for Ferrell, he has a <i>very </i>good idea of how hosting <i>SNL </i>works.</p>
