      <h1>Cory Booker mocks Buttigieg for falsely claiming endorsements from black leaders</h1>

      <p>Democratic New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker made fun of Pete Buttigieg after the South Bend, Indiana, mayor bungled the release of a list of black leaders supporting his campaign.</p>
      <p>"It's weird because I've never even been to Kenya," Booker said Wednesday on Twitter. The jab was in reference to the Buttigieg campaign using a stock photo of a Kenyan woman on a release for his plan to benefit black Americans.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Buttigieg <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/the-intercept-exposes-pete-buttigieg-for-inventing-fake-endorsements-for-his-douglass-plan-for-racial-justice">released a list of supposedly</a> 400 black leaders who supported his campaign. Many of the people on the list said they were neither black nor supporters of Buttigieg. The release came as Buttigieg <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/pete-who-buttigieg-struggles-with-black-voters-in-south-carolina-but-hes-still-got-time">continues to struggle</a> with black voters, including getting <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3649">0% support</a> from the group in a recent South Carolina poll.</p>
      <p>Democratic Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a top surrogate for Democratic Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-nina-turner-pete-buttigieg_n_5dd4a3f5e4b0e29d727b9197">blasted</a> Buttigieg for his handling of black issues. She labeled him "arrogant" and "callous," particularly in response to a shooting by a police officer in South Bend. "When a black woman says to you over the shooting of a black man in your city ... 'I’m not going to vote for you for president,' and you say to this black woman, ‘I didn’t ask you for your vote,’ I don’t think you are in any position to be the president of the United States of America," Turner said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg has <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/11/20/pete-buttigieg-black-voters-south-carolina/">claimed</a> he is not well-supported by the black community because they lack "familiarity" with him. "So, what’s working for us best right now in engaging the black community is two things: first, substance. And secondly, engagement," he said at a private fundraiser last week.</p>
