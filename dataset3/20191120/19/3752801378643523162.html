      <p>Britain exiting the European Union is "damaging for Ireland", the country's new central bank chief said Wednesday in his first formal speech.</p>
      <p>"Any form of Brexit will be damaging for Ireland," Gabriel Makhlouf said as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson looks to leave the EU by January 31 having recently secured a divorce deal with Brussels.</p>
      <p>"Looking ahead... trade and ongoing geopolitical tensions as well as Brexit pose risks to growth," said Makhlouf, who took up his new position in September.</p>
      <p>Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has said that Johnson's Brexit deal would benefit both eurozone-member Ireland and neighbouring Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The UK province's border with Ireland had been a major complication in Britain striking its Brexit deal.</p>
      <p>Speaking Wednesday in Waterford, southeast Ireland, Makhlouf said "the small and open nature of the Irish economy means that it is always particularly vulnerable to shocks stemming from abroad.</p>
      <p>"External risks are heightened at the moment, both due to structural developments - including the ongoing possibility of a disorderly Brexit and the risk of an escalation of trade wars - as well as cyclical developments, such as a sudden change in global financial conditions," he added.</p>
      <p>The central bank chief said reducing Irish public debt would help to "withstand negative shocks".</p>
      <p>As for Brexit alone, it "represents an enormous change - and transition - for the citizens of Ireland, for many Irish firms and for the economy as a whole", he said.</p>
      <p>"Brexit will inevitably bring disruption - even with a 'deal' - which, by its very nature, will dissipate over time.</p>
      <p>"But we must not lose sight of the inevitable long-term costs," Makhlouf stressed.</p>
      <p>In September, Ireland's central bank warned one in three farms would be at risk in a no-deal, which could see trade barriers erected and stiff tariffs imposed on meat.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Brexit itself remains at risk, depending on the outcome of Britain's general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Last month, Ireland's finance minister Paschal Donohoe unveiled a 2020 "no-deal" Brexit budget that includes a 1.2-billion-euro ($1.3 billion) relief fund.</p>
      <p>Ireland is projected to run a surplus of 0.2 percent of gross domestic product this year.</p>
      <p>Under no-deal projections, that would slip to a deficit of 0.6% of GDP in 2020.</p>
