      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Zach-Ertz/?tps=1">Zach Ertz</a>, Mark Andrews, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Greg_Olsen/?tps=1">Greg Olsen</a>, Darren Waller and Ryan Griffin top my Week 12 fantasy <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/John_Walker/?tps=1">football</a> tight end rankings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jared-Cook/?tps=1">Jared Cook</a>, Jacob Hollister, Vance McDonald, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Eric-Ebron/?tps=1">Eric Ebron</a> and Jonnu Smith round out my top-10 options for Week 12.</p>
      <p>If you are in a league that requires starting a tight end, other great options are available this week. Take a look at <a href="https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/2019/11/19/Fantasy-football-Week-12-best-adddrops-from-waiver-wire/3221574175714/">my weekly waiver wire article</a> if you need a replacement for your normal starter. My top 20 rankings can help you decide between two options to add to your starting lineup.</p>
      <p>You also should remove <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kansas-City-Chiefs/?tps=1">Kansas City Chiefs</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Arizona-Cardinals/?tps=1">Arizona Cardinals</a>, Los Angeles Chargers and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Minnesota-Vikings/?tps=1">Minnesota Vikings</a> players from your lineup, as those teams have Week 12 byes.</p>
      <p>Here are some of my favorite players in this week's top 20 rankings:</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOP SHELF</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zach Ertz is my No. 1 tight end for Week 12. The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Philadelphia-Eagles/?tps=1">Philadelphia Eagles</a> star secured nine catches for 94 yards in Week 11 against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_England_Patriots/?tps=1">New England Patriots</a>. He had a season-high 103 yards and a score on nine catches in Week 10 against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chicago_Bears/?tps=1">Chicago Bears</a>. I'm expecting another elite performance from Ertz in Week 12 against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Seattle-Seahawks/?tps=1">Seattle Seahawks</a>, a unit tied for allowing the eighth-most fantasy points to tight ends.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New-York-Jets/?tps=1">New York Jets</a> tight end Ryan Griffin is my No. 5 option at the position for Week 12. Griffin had a season-high 109 yards and a score in Week 11 and faces the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Oakland-Raiders/?tps=1">Oakland Raiders</a> in Week 12. The Raiders are allowing the third-most fantasy points per game to tight ends. You should start Griffin if you in a league that requires starting tight ends.</p>
      <p>
        <b>SNEAKY PLAYS</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pittsburgh_Steelers/?tps=1">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> pass-catcher Vance McDonald is my No. 8 option for Week 12. McDonald is a risky play, but has a good matchup against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Cincinnati-Bengals/?tps=1">Cincinnati Bengals</a> and should see more targets if <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/JuJu-Smith-Schuster/?tps=1">JuJu Smith-Schuster</a> misses this game. He should only be started in leagues that require starting tight ends.</p>
      <p>Jonnu Smith is another player who could see a larger workload in Week 12 due to an injury. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tennessee-Titans/?tps=1">Tennessee Titans</a> star <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Delanie-Walker/?tps=1">Delanie Walker</a> is dealing with an ankle injury and could miss this game against the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jacksonville-Jaguars/?tps=1">Jacksonville Jaguars</a>. The Titans will turn to Smith if Walker sits out. The Jaguars have been respectable against opposing tight ends this season, but I don't see them focussing on stopping Smith. He is my No. 10 option this week and is a solid bye week fill in.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LONGSHOTS</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Dallas-Cowboys/?tps=1">Dallas Cowboys</a> might not be able to throw all over the New England Patriots this week, but <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jason_Witten/?tps=1">Jason Witten</a> could have some opportunities underneath. I have the Cowboys veteran ranked as my No. 12 tight end for Week 12. Witten is still a risky play, but you could do much worse if you need help at the position. The Patriots will likely be focusing mostly on stopping <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ezekiel-Elliott/?tps=1">Ezekiel Elliott</a> and the Cowboys' wide receivers in this contest. I could see at least 50 receiving yards and a possible touchdown from Witten as a result of that oversight.</p>
      <p>Rhett Ellison is a dart throw tight end option for Week 12. The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/New_York_Giants/?tps=1">New York Giants</a> pass-catcher is my No. 16 option and should only be started in leagues that require starting tight ends. The Giants are facing the Chicago Bears, a unit that has allowed the fifth-most receiving yards to tight ends. Ellison should be involved in this matchup and on your TE1 radar if you are in a deep league.</p>
