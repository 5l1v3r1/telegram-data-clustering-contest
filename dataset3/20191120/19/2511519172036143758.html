      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a> has lashed out at his <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/democrats">Democratic</a> opponents conducting the House <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a>, mocked key witnesses giving testimony for their sartorial choices and denied that the onset of a heart attack was what prompted his sudden trip to hospital on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“These people are sick. They’re sick. And the press really in this country is dangerous. We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have the opposite. We have a very corrupt media,” the president ranted from the Cabinet Room of the White House.</p>
      <p>The inquiry heard from four witnesses on Tuesday who gave more telling details of his administration’s coercion of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and will hear on Wednesday from a man who could prove to be the hearings’ star turn, US ambassador to the EU <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a>, a hotelier and Trump donor who has already amended his original deposition to say there was a quid pro quo in play in US dealings with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a>.</p>

        <blockquote>Rep. Denny Heck, D-Washington: “This is the fifth of seven hearings. You may recall that JK Rowling wrote seven books in the Harry Potter series — there’s an enormous amount of plot revealed in the sixth and seventh books. So there’s much to come.”<br/>“I think the two most important takeaways are clear and explicit affirmation of the existence of a quid pro quo, and the pervasive nature of the foreknowledge on the part of people throughout the administration — everyone was in the loop, quote endnote.”</blockquote>
        <p> <br/>On the GOP's strategy in its line of questioning, Heck says: “I gave up a little while ago on trying to understand their perspective ... tried very, very hard for a while, but this is very difficult, to sit and listen to how it is they’re approaching this. I’ll go to my grave not fully understanding this.”</p>

        <blockquote>I spoke to Jordan during the break, asked how things were going. “It’ll be fine. I think Steve [Castor] did a great job showing that this guy never had any direct communication from the president that any way suggests that there was anything linked to making an announcement about an investigation.”<br/>When I pointed out that Sondland pretty clearly stated that everyone involved followed the president’s orders, he said: “No he didn’t — there was never any aid whatsoever — a meeting or a call — linked to an announcement from the Ukrainians.”</blockquote>
