      </ul>
      <p>Aside from the satisfaction of a job well done, making your own baked goods from scratch tastes better, is better for you, and it generally costs much less than buying products from the store. KitchenAid mixers make home baking a cinch.</p>
      <p>Even if baking isn’t your thing, there are plenty of secondary uses for these mixers that make them well worth your money. If you have ever watched one of those prime-time cooking shows, you have likely noticed a KitchenAid mixer in the kitchen. They are the standard in the industry. Here are some things to consider when you are ready to ramp up your culinary experience.</p>
      <h4>Tilt-head versus bowl-lift</h4>
      <p>KitchenAid mixers come with a tilt-head or a lever that lifts your bowl up to the mixing attachment. The one that is best for you depends on how much space you have. The lift models tend to be taller and wider, therefore they require more counter space. But, they generally perform better than the tilt-head units, which can bounce when handling larger batches of dough.</p>
      <h4>Accessories and attachments</h4>
      <p>One of the aspects of KitchenAid mixers that sets them apart from the competition is the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-kitchenaid-attachment">array of optional attachments and accessories</a> available. Most of the attachments work with any of the company’s stand mixers. Here are a few of the most popular accessories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b><a href="https://amzn.to/2xCIKHe">Ice Cream Maker</a>: </b>In 20 to 30 minutes, this attachment will make up to two quarts of gelato, sorbet, or ice cream.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://amzn.to/2euTBOQ">Pasta Roller and Cutter</a>:</b> Stainless steel cutters and rollers produce six-inch sheets of pasta with eight thickness settings and can be cut for fettuccine, spaghetti, and more.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://amzn.to/2vQedUl">Food Grinder</a>:</b> Use this to grind dried bread, meat, vegetables, cheeses, firm fruit, and use it with the stuffer set to make sausage.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://amzn.to/2wXEFAq">Food Processor</a>:</b> This attachment will shred, dice, julienne, and slice any vegetables, cheeses, and fruits.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although there are a lot of similarities between models – including high-quality construction and a one-year warranty – not all KitchenAid mixers are the same. Based on our assessment of the reviews and ratings of thousands of buyers and experts, we have come up with recommendations that will guide you in choosing the best KitchenAid mixer for your needs.</p>

      <h4>The best KitchenAid mixer overall</h4>
      <h4>From bread dough to honey, the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_090117_best-kitchenaid-mixers/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/tilt-head-stand-mixers/p.artisan-series-5-quart-tilt-head-stand-mixer.ksm150pser.html">KitchenAid Artisan Tilt-Head Stand Mixer with Pouring Shield</a> is powerful enough to handle just about anything you throw at it.</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_090117_best-kitchenaid-mixers/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/tilt-head-stand-mixers/p.artisan-series-5-quart-tilt-head-stand-mixer.ksm150pser.html">KitchenAid KSM150 Artisan mixer</a> is designed for the serious home baker. It comes with a 5-quart stainless steel bowl that can mix dough for four loaves of bread or nine dozen cookies in one batch. Also included are a six-wire whip, coated flat beater, one-piece pouring shield, and coated dough hook. There are 47 colors for this appliance available on Amazon, so you are sure to find an option that matches the décor of your kitchen.</p>
      <p>Another feature of the KSM150 is the “59-point planetary mixing action.” This essentially means that for every rotation around the bowl, the dough hook, wire whip, or beater has 59 touch points for more thorough mixing.</p>
      <p>Many of the home and kitchen appliance experts have reviewed the KSM150 Artisan mixer, and most were impressed with its power. <a href="http://www.toptenreviews.com/home/kitchen/best-mixers/kitchenaid-artisan-review/">Top Ten Reviews</a> lists this model as the best mixer because of the solid motor, its versatility, and the color selection. The reviewer only dinged it for not having a timer, overload protection, or other more advanced features.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.co.uk/institute/product-reviews/mixers/kitchenaid-artisan-stand-mixer-ksm150">Good Housekeeping</a> endorsed the KSM150 with a score of 93 out of 100 because of the broad range of speeds, ability to handle bread dough, and stylish, robust design. <a href="https://foodal.com/kitchen/kitchen-appliances/stand-mixers/kitchen-aid-artisan/">Foodal</a> liked that this model comes with all you need to get started, and ranked it number one on its list.</p>
      <p>After combing through customer reviews, we noticed that a lot of buyers like how sturdy the mixer is. It doesn’t try to walk off your counter when it’s working on a tough task. The biggest complaint was that the mixing bowl sometimes leaves a gray residue on the food you are preparing. KitchenAid recommends scrubbing your mixer bowl with baking soda or lemon and salt to remove the polishing material used on the bowl. Also, buyers complained about having trouble choosing which of the ten available shades of blue to go with for their KitchenAid.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Powerful 325-watt motor, comes with pouring shield, dozens of colors to choose from</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> No overload protection</p>

      <h4>The best budget mixer</h4>

      <p>KitchenAid mixers are not cheap. Yet, the <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_090117_best-kitchenaid-mixers/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/tilt-head-stand-mixers/p.classic-series-4.5-quart-tilt-head-stand-mixer.k45ssob.html">K45SS</a> is the least expensive option available. It comes with a 4.5-quart bowl, a coated dough hook, 10-speed settings powered by a 250-watt motor, a wire whip, and a coated flat beater. And, as with other KitchenAid units, it has a multipurpose attachment hub that takes more than a dozen optional attachments that can be used to make pasta, grind meat, and much more.</p>
      <p>Since the mixer has a relatively small motor, it is one of the quietest mixers you will find. You can control the speed using a shifting knob on the side of the unit. The K45SS does not have a slow start mixing option, so if you are mixing dry ingredients, such as flour, the fast start could send ingredients flying. You can combat this with a pouring shield, which this model does not come with, but you can <a href="http://amzn.to/2wpnvdr">pick one up on Amazon</a>.</p>
      <p>All of the expert reviews we looked at for this guide were positive. <a href="http://mixerreviews.co.uk/kitchenaid-k45ss/">Mixer Reviews</a> liked the K45SS because its small stature made it ideal for most countertops. The site did note that you may want to splurge on one of the Professional Series models if you plan on regularly making bread or have larger mixing loads.</p>
      <p><a href="http://ratingle.com/stand-mixers/kitchenaid-k45sswh-k45ss-classic-stand-mixer-review/">Ratingle</a> rated the K45SS highly for the dependability of the 250-watt motor and quality design. <a href="http://mixitbakeit.com/kitchenaid-classic-stand-mixer-review/">Mix It Bake It</a> echoed Mixer Reviews’ concern about using this model for heavy-duty dough, like bread dough. However, the reviewer commented that it is an excellent budget mixer for light to moderate mixing tasks.</p>
      <p>Judging by customer reviews, most people liked the versatility of this mixer and found that the attractive design fit well with just about any kitchen décor. There were a couple of complaints, though. In addition to the gray residue problem mentioned in the above review, users complained that the included bowl does not have a handle. So, you may want to <a href="http://amzn.to/2vPVh87">buy a replacement bowl</a> if that bothers you.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Affordable, 10 different speed settings, tilt-up mixer head</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Least powerful motor on the list</p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/6415797/type/dlg/sid/biipgf_090117_best-kitchenaid-mixers/https://www.kitchenaid.com/countertop-appliances/stand-mixers/bowl-lift-stand-mixers/p.professional-hd-series-5-quart-bowl-lift-stand-mixer.kg25h0xaq.html">KitchenAid Professional 5 Plus</a> has a ten-speed motor with a slow start function and overload protection. The mixer comes with a 5-quart stainless steel mixing bowl featuring an ergonomic handle. Also, the hinged hub cover flips up to make it easier to install attachments, including the spiral dough hook, wire whip, and flat beater that it comes with. The bowl is lifted to the mixer are using a simple lever that securely stays in place.</p>
      <p>The Professional 5 Plus is available in 13 colors on Amazon, including Metallic Chrome, Empire Red, Cobalt Blue, and Onyx Black.</p>
      <p>For 15 years now, I have owned and regularly used the forebear of the Professional 5 Plus: the Professional 5. The Professional 5 Plus improves upon my model with a stronger motor (450 watts versus 350 watts), overload protection, and slow start. That said, my model has done a fabulous job making cookies, cake, pie, and everything else we ask of it. In fact, I bake two loaves of bread per week, and it has never had a problem kneading the dough, even with the weaker motor.</p>
      <p>One of the expert sites that reviewed the Professional 5 Plus was <a href="http://ratingle.com/stand-mixers/kitchenaid-kv25goxer-professional-5-plus-empire-red-stand-mixer-review/">Ratingle</a>, and the site put it among its top four KitchenAid stand mixers. The reviewer liked the flexibility afforded by the 10 speeds of the 450-watt motor. However, the site noted that this unit is quite loud when in use.</p>
      <p>The overload reset button sets this model apart from other KitchenAid products. A slow start-up keeps your ingredients from flying everywhere.</p>
      <p>Buyers who left reviews seem to agree that it packs a lot of power while taking up relatively little counter space, and at 16.5 inches tall, it fits under most cabinets. Reviewers found it especially helpful for making bread, cakes, and pies.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Advanced features, ergonomic design, 67-point mixing</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Heavy, loud</p>

The stainless steel bowl holds 6 quarts of ingredients. That is enough room to make thirteen dozen cookies or six loaves of bread in one batch. And, the 575-watt motor is strong enough for just about any job. It has a bowl-lift design and comes with a wire whip, burnished spiral dough hook, a one-piece pouring shield, and a burnished flat beater. The only reason this model isn’t our top overall pick is that it is more mixer than most people need.</p>
      <p>The Professional 600 Series mixer is available in 23 different colors on Amazon. Some of the most popular alternatives include Nickel Pearl, Pearl Metallic, Empire Red, and Gloss Cinnamon.</p>
      <p>The expert sites give the KitchenAid Professional 600 Series mixer strong ratings in the 4- or 5-star range. <a href="http://mixitbakeit.com/kitchenaid-professional-600-stand-mixer-review/">Mix It Bake It</a> recommended it to bakers who make bread on a daily basis or who make larger volumes of baked goods at once. <a href="https://cooksmeasure.com/review/kitchenaid-professional-600-series-stand-mixer-review-best-for-bakers">The Cook’s Measure</a> rated it highly because of its versatile add-ons and large capacity, and the site recommended it for couples who entertain and busy family cooks. <a href="https://foodal.com/kitchen/kitchen-appliances/stand-mixers/kitchenaid-6-quart-professional-600-series-review/">Foodal</a> also gave it high marks for accessories as well as performance and value. Of course, most of the KitchenAid mixers have the same accessories.</p>
      <p>Several customer reviews mention the sturdy all-metal gears and metal gearbox. It does an excellent job of kneading bread dough, which is great for bakers with arthritis who can’t do it by hand. Just one note, though, be sure to never knead the dough on a setting higher than 2. Anything faster is unnecessary and bad for the motor.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Largest capacity and most powerful mixer on the list</p>
      <p><b>Cons:</b> Expensive, heavy</p>

This is the main difference between the KSM155 and KSM150, our top choice. Consequently, you are essentially paying $40 extra for a glass bowl instead of stainless steel.</p>

      <p>The experts at <a href="https://foodal.com/kitchen/kitchen-appliances/stand-mixers/kitchenaid-5-quart-artisan-design-review/">Foodal</a> gave this KitchenAid Artisan Design Series mixer a positive review because of its durable construction, proven performance, and powerful motor. However, the site cautions that it may have trouble with kneading huge batches of bread dough for long periods of time without overheating. <a href="http://kitchappliancereviews.com/kitchenaid-artisan-design-series-5-qt-stand-mixer-with-glass-bowl/">Kitchen Appliance Reviews</a> liked that the KSM155GB does a good job of mixing ingredients until they are smooth. The attachments reach every part of the bowl.</p>
      <p>We did come across a few customer reviews that mention how the machine strains when dealing with heavier doughs, such as pizza dough.</p>
      <p><b>Pros:</b> Attractive glass bowl with measurements incorporated, fits in small spaces</p>
