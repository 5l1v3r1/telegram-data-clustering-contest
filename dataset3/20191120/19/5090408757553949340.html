        <li>While some people were ecstatic to learn she’d won, others questioned why she was awarded after posting only a handful of tutorials throughout the year.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/youtuber">YouTuber</a> later took to Instagram to thank fans for voting for her. She also said she believes “so many people in the industry” deserve the award more than she does.</li>

      <p>Jaclyn Hill was named the Makeup Tutorialist of the Year at the 2019 American Influencer Awards, held on Monday in Hollywood, California.</p>
      <p>Many people have since congratulated the YouTuber on her accomplishment, though others have questioned if she’s actually deserving of the praise; not only has Hill uploaded only a handful of tutorials in 2019, but she also launched a <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-say-had-reactions-to-jaclyn-cosmetics-lipstick-2019-6">disastrous lipstick line</a> in June.</p>
      <p>Now, Hill has responded to her critics, and admitted she believes “so many people in the industry” deserve the award more than she does.</p>

      <h3>Jaclyn Hill took home the Makeup Tutorialist of the Year award on Monday</h3>
      <p>The YouTuber got emotional as she stepped onstage at the awards show, saying: “B—- I’m not gonna cry!”</p>
      <p>“Okay I’m not kidding – I was really hoping that I wasn’t gonna win because I suck at this, but thank you guys,” Hill said. “I mean, this has been such a hard year and I love you. This is awesome. Am I the only one who cried tonight?”</p>
      <p>“I just gotta say, the only thing I really gotta get across to you guys because I did not prepare anything, is thank you for voting for me,” she continued. “I can’t believe this because I did not even talk about it. I just felt so insecure. But it’s just more than makeup to me. Thank you for allowing me to teach you how to feel beautiful.”</p>

      <p>Others, however, questioned if Hill is the most deserving influencer. Many argued that she didn’t post enough tutorials throughout 2019 – she shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Jaclynhill1">five tutorials and seven other beauty videos</a> this year- while others implied her disastrous lipstick launch should’ve disqualified her.</p>

      <p>On Instagram, she shared similar sentiments, and also seemingly addressed her critics. According to Hill, she believes “so many people in the industry” deserve the award more than she does.</p>
      <p>“I don’t even know what to say,” Hill wrote on Twitter. “I was NOT expecting this award. I truly believe that so many people in the industry deserve this more than I do. But my JACPACK rides for me so hard &amp; I could not be more grateful for you guys!”</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe how many of you voted, I was such an emotional mess about it!” she continued. “And side note, I can’t believe I cried on stage!!!! I love you guys! THANK YOU!!!!”</p>

      <h3>Hill recently announced that she’s launching a holiday makeup collection</h3>
      <p>Prior to the awards ceremony, Hill announced in a YouTube video that her beauty brand, Jaclyn Cosmetics, will be releasing a holiday collection of highlighters. The products will be her first following the disastrous launch of her lipsticks – which many people said <a href="https://www.insider.com/jaclyn-hill-cosmetics-broken-lipstick-accusations-2019-6">arrived broken</a> and caused <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-say-had-reactions-to-jaclyn-cosmetics-lipstick-2019-6">swelling on the lips</a> – in June.</p>
