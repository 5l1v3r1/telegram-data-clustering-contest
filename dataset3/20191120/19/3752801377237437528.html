      <h1>PE mom in court for cutting off penis of man she believed raped, murdered daughter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:35:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author">Nosipiwo Manona</a></address>
      <p>August 2 will forever be embedded in the memory of 23-year-old mother Veronique Makwena.</p>
      <p>On that day three months ago, her five-year-old daughter, Chantelle, went missing from their home in the Rocklands farm area, Port Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>"I left her with my friend who had been staying with us, because she was not well - I was going to the shop with my elder sister," said Makwena.</p>
      <p>"We walked to the shops, which is some distance away, and when we got home my daughter wasn't there and it was night already."</p>
      <p>Makwena said they looked everywhere for Chantelle but when it became dark, they had to stop.</p>
      <p>"What boggled my mind was the fact that I could see Chantelle's shoes lying on the floor. She never went outside without her shoes on."</p>
      <p>Her body was found a day after she disappeared, bloodied and slumped over a toilet seat close to their home.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Makwena appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate's Court with her sister-in-law, Noxolo Maneli. The two women, together with family friend Siyabonga Pakade, have been charged with attempted murder.</p>
      <p>They are accused of assaulting and cutting off the penis of the man they believe raped and killed Chantelle a month after her lifeless body was found by her father.</p>

      <p>"When she was found, my heart sank, I was crushed. My pinkmeisie was gone. While we looked for her through the night, she had been lying in that cold toilet. I was broken, I still am."</p>
      <p>The three women were arrested in September after they confronted the alleged perpetrator who is known to them.</p>
      <p>They were held in custody in September for two weeks.</p>
      <p>Their plight received widespread attention and they were later released on bail through the assistance of people who had heard about their plight on different platforms.</p>
      <p>Advocate Fundile Matoto offered to represent the three pro bono.</p>
      <p>Matoto said he was concerned about the charges that have been levelled against them.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion, this case is a matter of assault, at most, grievous bodily harm."</p>
      <p>He said he was prepared for the case and work toward either a dismissal of the charges or go to trial.</p>
      <p>Matoto added he would follow-up on the absence of the third accused, who is in custody for another case.</p>
      <p>He also raised concerns about the failure of the police to make an arrest for Chantelle's murder, despite DNA samples having been taken on the day her body was discovered.</p>
      <p>The case has been postponed to February 6, 2020, for further investigation.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu confirmed no arrests have been made for the rape and murder of Chantelle.</p>
      <p>"We are still waiting for the DNA results," she said.</p>
