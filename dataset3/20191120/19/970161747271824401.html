      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/halsey/">Halsey</a> has asked BTS fans to ease off after the K-Pop group were not nominated for a Grammy award.</p>
      <p>The south Korean group’s passionate fanbase, called ARMY, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/bts-army-drags-disgraceful-grammys-k-pop-stars-fail-get-nominated-11189208/">have been left disappointed by the nominations for 2020</a>, with the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lizzo/">Lizzo</a> and Ariana Grande up for multiple gongs.</p>
      <p>Halsey, who worked with BTS on the single Boy With Luv, responded on Twitter to an ARMY who asked why she hadn’t spoken out about the snub.</p>
      <p>In a now-deleted tweet, the Without Me singer said: ‘I just woke up and the biggest song of my career wasn’t nominated either. Can u guys not take ur anger out on me for once or’.</p>
      <p>She later added: ‘Deleting and ignoring all negativity. BTS deserved many nominations.</p>
      <p>‘I am however, unsurprised that they weren’t acknowledged. the US is so far behind on the whole movement. the time will come.[sic]’</p>
