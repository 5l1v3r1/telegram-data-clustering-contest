      <h2>Erling Braut Haaland has been heavily linked with Man Utd - but an Arsenal transfer could also be on the cards after reportedly visiting their training ground with his Dad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:06:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:06</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>In-demand striker Erling Braut Haaland has reportedly visited Arsenal's training ground as speculation mounts over his future.</p>
      <p>Norwegian ace Haaland has emerged as one of Europe's most wanted talents after his prolific goalscoring exploits for Red Bull Salzburg, particularly in the Champions League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> are believed to be at the front of the queue to land Haaland, 19, as they plot their move.</p>
      <p>But Sport Bild claim <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> also have a significant level of interest.</p>
      <p>They say Haaland and father Alf-Inge Haaland, who previously played for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> and Leeds, have already made a personal visit to Arsenal's training ground to learn more about the club and check out the facilities at London Colney.</p>

      <p>There have previously been claims Alf-Inge has paid a similar visit to Carrington to see what Manchester United can offer.</p>
      <p>But Sport Bild also claim he is advising his son to head to the Bundesliga amid interest from Bayern Munich before he moves on to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There are also claims that RB Leipzig, who share owners with current club Red Bull Salzburg, will be offered the chance to sign Haaland for a cut-price fee of just £25.7m, much less than the £85m fee quoted to other parties.</p>

      <p>Arsenal are at risk of losing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Alexandre Lacazette if they do not secure a return to Champions League football.</p>
      <p>With the duo failing to commit their long-term futures to the club, the Gunners could pursue a move for Haaland if one of them looks set to depart.</p>
      <p>United could have the upper hand due to Solskjaer's existing relationship with the youngster, handing him his first team debut at Molde.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils boss has reportedly instructed club bosses to push ahead with a move for Haaland in the January transfer window with Jadon Sancho also on his radar in a big-money swoop for two of his top transfer targets.</p>
