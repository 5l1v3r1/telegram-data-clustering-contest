      <p>The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency has announced its involvement in an ongoing operation to curtail a fire outbreak at the upper floor of a storey building plaza in Akerele, a street in Surulere axis.</p>
      <p>The fire, according to the outcome of preliminary investigations conducted at the incident site, resulted from an electrical surge in one of the shops before escalating to other parts of the plaza.</p>
      <p>However, no loss of life or injury has been recorded so far at the scene of the ongoing fire incident, where properties worth a fortune have been lost to the inferno, LASEMA said.</p>
      <p>LASEMA, Officers of the Nigerian Police Force, Lagos State Neighbourhood Corps, Federal and Lagos State Fire Services are responders working together at the incident scene to combat the inferno from escalating to the adjoining buildings.</p>
