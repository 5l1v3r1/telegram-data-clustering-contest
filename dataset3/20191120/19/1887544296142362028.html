      <h1>New Ottawa police chief vows vigilance on racial bias, discrimination</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:13:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:13</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press</a></address>
      <p>Ottawa police Chief Peter Sloly says new traffic-stop data and the results of a diversity audit show more steps are needed to ensure bias-free law enforcement in the nation's capital.</p>
      <p>Sloly, who became the city's top cop late last month, says the police force is committed to doing all it can to address community and member concerns about discrimination.</p>
      <p>A new report covering 2017-18, a follow-up to earlier research, shows Middle Eastern and black drivers continue to experience disproportionately high incidences of traffic stops by Ottawa police.</p>
      <p>However, the total number of people pulled over for traffic violations by Ottawa police declined by 35 per cent from 2013 to 2018.</p>
      <p>Researchers say the drop is significant since consultations several years ago found that minorities felt they were subject to excessive scrutiny by police.</p>
      <p>The diversity audit concludes that while the Ottawa force is making some progress, there is still work to do in areas including leadership, policy, promotional processes and community policing.</p>
