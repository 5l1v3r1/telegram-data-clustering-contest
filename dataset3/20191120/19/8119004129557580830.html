        <b>The government has decided to waive cargo handling charges on onion imports on the flights of flag carrier Biman Bangladesh Airlines.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For faster shipment, the essential cooking ingredient is being airlifted from several countries to cool down the market.</p>
      <p>Biman charges Tk 18 per kg on perishable goods for the cargo handling services.</p>
      <p>The civil aviation and tourism ministry decided to waive the charges to keep onion prices stable, according to a notice issued on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"We’ve decided to waive the cargo handling charge on onion imports for the sake of public interest,” Civil Aviation and Tourism Secretary Mohibul Haque told bdnews24.com.</p>
      <p>The decision will remain effective as long as onion is shipped through airways, he added.</p>
      <p>Onion prices have continued to surge since Sept 29 when India banned exports to control domestic prices, prompting the government to take several measures to tame the spiralling price.</p>
      <p>Prices rose to Tk 180 a kg, which is a Tk 30 jump in two days, after Cyclone Bulbul that struck the coastline on Nov 9 squeezed supplies. The prices continued to rise and hovered around Tk 250, a record in Bangladesh, over the weekend.</p>
      <p>To deal with the situation, the government decided to import onions from Egypt, Turkey and China. It also decided to import onion through airway for faster shipments.</p>
