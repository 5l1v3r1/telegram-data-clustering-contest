        <b>Losing Vanessa Woodfield (Michelle Hardwick) has proven to be a huge wake up call to Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) in Emmerdale as she has realised how deeply in love she is with her and how she has helped her to become a more stable and responsible person.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stung by Charity’s lies around the casino scam, Vanessa decided enough was enough and called time on the relationship and despite Charity promising to change and begging her to take her back, defiant Vanessa has stood her gound, determined to prove that she can’t just be walked over and they are equals in this partnership.</p>
      <p>Since the split, things have been chaotic for Charity, with Moses ending up in the middle of a kidnap drama. She then fell out with both Cain (Jeff Hordley) and Chas (Lucy Pargeter) and after Sarah Sugden (Katie Hill) got ill after a party in the house, Charity feared that things could have been much worse due to her heart condition.</p>

      <p>Telling Vanessa that she is the only one she can talk to and be honest with, Charity made another attempt to win her round and told her how much she was struggling without her. It gave Vanessa food for thought and she later called round to reiterate to Charity that while she has proven her priorities are right this week with the kids and she loves her for it, she won’t be lied to again.</p>

      <p>Promising that she will do her best and not lie to her again, Charity pinned her hopes on another chance and Vanessa soon pulled her close as they shared a reunion kiss. Back on track, Charity realises she may have taken things for granted – while Vanessa added that she doesn’t like always being the sensible one.</p>
