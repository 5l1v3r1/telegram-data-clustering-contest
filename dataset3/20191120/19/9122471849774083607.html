      <h1>Colts Issue Injury Update For WR T.Y. Hilton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:28:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:28</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The Colts might receive a much-needed boost on Thursday night when they face the Texans. Despite missing the past three games with a calf injury, Pro Bowl wideout T.Y. Hilton is just about ready to return.</p>
      <p>Indianapolis went 1-2 during Hilton’s absence. The offense struggled without its best wide receiver against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins.</p>
      <p>With the AFC South up for grabs, the Colts are ready to welcome Hilton back to the starting lineup. Even though he’s not guaranteed to play on Thursday, his status is trending in the right direction.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, the Colts listed Hilton as a full participant for today’s practice.</p>
      <p>Hilton is officially questionable to play tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>Eric Ebron is also listed as questionable for Indianapolis in Week 12.</p>

      <p>Hilton has been quite successful throughout his career against the Houston Texans, totaling 1,519 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns in those meetings.</p>
      <p>Since the Colts won’t have Marlon Mack for the foreseeable future because of a broken hand, the return of T.Y. Hilton should keep the offense afloat moving forward.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 8:20 p.m. ET from NRG Stadium.</p>
      <p>We’ll know soon enough if Hilton will be active for the Colts.</p>
