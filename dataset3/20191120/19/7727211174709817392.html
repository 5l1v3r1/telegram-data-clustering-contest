      <p>Emmerdale fans were left fuming tonight as Jacob used Leanna after struggling to cope with Maya being released from prison.</p>
      <p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-emmerdale-fans-stunned-casting-17221245">viewers saw</a> a very pregnant Maya leave prison, but when Jacob tried to call her, she refused to take his call.</p>
      <p>A despondent Jacob headed to the shed to take some time out, when his friend Leanna came to check if he was ok.</p>
      <p>After chatting Jacob made a move on Leanna, who also has a crush on him.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-emmerdale-recasts-asan-njies-17220935">Fans saw</a> them kissing and then after the break Jacob and Leanna could be seen under a blanket cuddling.</p>

      <p>But Jacob quickly grabbed his stuff and made to leave, with Leanna confessing it was her first time.</p>
      <p>She said: "I'm not asking for marks out of ten but....."</p>
      <p>Jacob responded: "What, that was the first time you'd done that?"</p>
      <p>She said: "What, do you think I do it with everyone?"</p>
      <p>Jacob made his excuses, saying he had to leave and check something with his dad, leaving Leanna upset and on her own.</p>

      <p>And <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-emmerdale-speculation-vinny-rumoured-17219863">fans couldn't believe</a> his actions towards the young girl - especially when he later text her asking "just checking you're on the pill."</p>
      <p>Liam said: "Jesus. Jacob gets classier and classier."</p>
      <p>Chris P said: "can Jacob get any lower? yes it's Emmerdale of course he can."</p>
      <p>Dion said: "Oh Jacob you donâ€™t s**g then run."</p>
