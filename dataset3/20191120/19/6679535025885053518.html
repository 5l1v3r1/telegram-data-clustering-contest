      <p>A 32-year-old TSRTC employee who suffered brain stroke, died at a private hospital in Hyderabad on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The employee, Sheik Jafar, used to work as a conductor with the corporation at Medak depot.</p>
      <p>His family member, Hussain, said that Jafar was worried whether he would get back the job and that anxiety led to brain stroke on November 13.</p>
      <p>He was initially taken to the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation’s (TSRTC) Hospital in Tarnaka, from where he was referred to Sai Sajeevani Hospital in Saroornagar.</p>
      <p>Jafar is survived by wife Majeeunnisa, a son and daughter. She is expecting their third child.</p>
      <p>Jafar’s body was brought to Salabatpur in Kowdipally mandal for performing last rites.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, an office-bearer of the National Mazdoor Union (NMU), E Ashok, requested the State government to give government jobs to family members of RTC employees who died.</p>
      <p>A total of 27 people have died since the strike was launched on October 5.</p>
      <p>Mr. Ashok further requested the government to issue ₹1,000 crore for payment of pending salaries of employees. A few employees have retired in the past two months. Full and final settlement was requested to be processed.</p>
