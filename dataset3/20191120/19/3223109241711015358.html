      <h1>May These Missing ‘Sword and Shield’ Pokemon Rest in Peace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:35:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.geek.com/games/we-almost-got-the-star-wars-and-pokemon-games-we-always-wanted-1810948/"><i>Pokemon Sword and Shield</i></a> are finally here, and as more folks get their hands on the first core Pokemon RPGs for <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/play-these-games-on-your-nintendo-switch-lite-1802971/">Nintendo Switch</a>, a lot of the controversy that plagued these games since their reveal has slowly faded away. I had plenty of issues with the games, but most of them paled in comparison to how close it gets to being the lush open-world Pokemon adventure of our dreams.</p>
      <p>The downside is that only 400 Pokemon, about half of all the creatures, have come along for the ride. Like I said, this doesn’t bother me nearly as much as it bothers some very angry people. I would rather the developers focus on other parts of the game than carrying over nearly a thousand redundant monsters. Just make new ones! But I’m not so heartless that I don’t feel some pain about the friends we lost along the way.</p>
      <p>Pour one out for these Pokemon missing in<i> Sword and Shield…  </i>if you aren’t a hacker.</p>

      <h3>Bulbasaur</h3>
      <p>Bulbasaur was my original partner Pokemon in the first games. Cutting it basically means cutting my heart.</p>

      <h3>Lickitung</h3>
      <p>Considering <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/pokemon-lets-go-pikachu-eevee-is-for-your-heart-not-your-brain-1760534/"><i>Pokemon Let Go</i></a> already created HD models of all original 151 Pokemon, it’s wild to me that any of them got cut. But missing this big tongue boi really stings.</p>

      <h3>Smugleaf</h3>
      <p>This Pokemon is actually named Snivy, but Smugleaf is just too accurate. Maybe it was its bad attitude that spelled its doom.</p>

        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mewtwo-smash-ultimate.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Mewtwo</h3>
      <p>Not just the first great Pokemon villain, but perhaps the only Pokemon with any real compelling pathos. Mewtwo deserves to just chill on its clone island.</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Meltan</h3>
      <p>Meltan is a brand new Pokemon who debuted in <i>Let’s Go</i>. We thought for sure this was a tease for its full appearance the next generation. But nope!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/greninja-smash-ultimate.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Greninja</h3>
      <p>Wild how a Pokemon can make the cut for <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/the-ultimate-super-smash-bros-character-guide-greninja-1766950/"><i>Super Smash Bros</i></a>. but not a Pokemon game. We stan a dark frog ninja.</p>

      <h3>Decidueye</h3>
      <p>This ghost owl sniper is one of the cooler grass evolutions in years, and at least it got its due in the Switch version of <i>Pokken Tournament</i>.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/deadmudkip.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Mudkip</h3>
      <p>Nintendo heard you like Mudkip, so they got rid of them.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/buzzwole.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Buzzwole</h3>
      <p>Buzzwole is such a perfect name for this buff bug ultra beast that I constantly think I made it up. But nope, that’s what they really call it.</p>

      <h3>Loudred</h3>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/pokemon-detective-pikachu-is-the-great-new-speed-racer-1787072/"><i>Detective Pikachu</i></a> there’s a scene where Loudred hang out with Diplo in an underground Pokemon fighting ring. Put it in the game!</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/ho-oh.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Ho-Oh</h3>
      <p>In the very first episode of the Pokemon anime, the legendary Ho-Oh appeared, teasing second-generation Pokemon before the first even started and showing us just how wonderful and mysterious this world can be.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/arceus.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Arceus</h3>
      <p>Arceus is literally Pokemon God. We understand that it’s just too powerful for humble Pokemon England.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m27-ohj_sU0" width="500" height="281" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Psyduck</h3>
      <p>This psychic duck with chronic headaches seems like a low-tier Pokemon mascot at this point. I personally know lots of people concerned about its absence.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/cubone.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Cubone</h3>
      <p>Considering dead mothers are the origins of all Cubone, this Pokemon is already accustomed to loss.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/jigglypuff-smash-ultimate.png"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Jigglypuff</h3>
      <p>Jigglypuff is probably more offended about being cut than we could ever be. It’s going to sing the developers to sleep and draw on their faces with a marker.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.geek.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cursola.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h3>Corsola</h3>
      <p><i>Pokemon Sword and Shield’s</i> bravest act of political commentary has nothing to do with Brexit. Instead, the game ditches the original happy pink version of Corsola for a sad colorless version that involves into ghost-type Cursola. This reflects how climate change is killing coral in oceans around the globe.</p>
      <h3>Purchase Pokemon Sword and Shield</h3>
