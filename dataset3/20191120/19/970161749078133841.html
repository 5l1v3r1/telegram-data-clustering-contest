        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/celebs-go-dating/">Celebs Go Dating</a> is back for a new series as more single celebs look for love.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The line-up for 2020 already looks like it’s going to be great and we can’t wait to see it.</p>
      <p>Stars include <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>’s Amy Hart – and we all know how things went for her during her appearance on the ITV show, when she got left by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/curtis-pritchard/">Curtis Pritchard</a> who then went on to try his luck with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maura-higgins/">Maura Higgins</a>.</p>
      <p>She was also linked to DJ Toby Anstis, 48, but the reality star denied any romances happening.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve joined the Agency because I’m the epitome of a dating disaster,’ Amy said in the teaser clip.</p>
      <p>Other stars include TOWIE’s Amy Childs and James Lock, Hollyoaks’ Malique Thompson-Dwyer, EastEnders’ Dean Gaffney, and the one and only Liv Bentley from Made in Chelsea.</p>

      <p>With the amount of times Liv broke up and got back together with former boyfriend Digby Edgley, we’re not surprised she’s turning to the Celeb Dating Agency for help.</p>
      <p>Paul Carrick Brunson and Anna Williamson are back to do what they do best, match celebrities with totally normal people to go on boozy dates with.</p>
      <p>And it won’t be Celebs Go Dating without Tom-Read Wilson’s constant sexual innuendos while he cleans around the lobby.</p>
      <p>Now all we need to do is wait for the drama, tears, and awkward first dates.</p>
