      <p>Apple's iPhones haven't been known for having the best battery life, so last year the company introduced its own battery cases. For this year's <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-11-review">iPhone 11</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro-review">iPhone 11 Pro</a> family, Apple has new versions of these cases - but, this time, they also added a shutter button for the camera.</p>
      <p>The new Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-11-pro-max-review">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> has an extra button built-in on the side - one that, to be clear, isn't on the iPhone. Neither does it just tap-through to the volume rocker, which takes photos if the camera app is open. </p>
      <p>Instead, the button launches the camera app whether the phone is locked or not, and it can take a photo with a quick press and record video with a longer press. It's a quick shortcut that conceivably gets you shooting and recording faster.</p>
      <p>This is a big enough deal that it was even called out in a Tweet.</p>

      <h4>Hardware for the win</h4>
      <p>It might seem like a small addition. After all, the focus of the case is the 50% boost in battery life, and the fact it still works with Qi wireless charging and Lightning accessories. But, the camera button is kind of a big deal.</p>
      <p>Pressing a physical button can be a lot easier than pressing an on-screen one. Adding that convenience and dependability to the camera can bump up their ease of use. </p>
      <p>With Apple's cameras being one of the standout features on the iPhone 11 line of phones - especially with the improved night mode - anything that can improve the experience is worth considering as an upgrade.</p>
      <p>It doesn't hurt that the case extending the battery life also means there's that much more time to take photos and record videos. </p>
