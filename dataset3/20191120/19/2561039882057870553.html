      <p>Apple has released a new Smart Battery Case for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max that features a dedicated camera button!<br/><br/>-----<br/>Engineered for iPhone 11 Pro Max, the Smart Battery Case gives you even longer battery life while offering great protection. Inside, a soft microfiber lining helps protect your iPhone. And on the outside, the silky, soft-touch finish of the silicone exterior feels great in your hand. A soft elastomer hinge design makes it easy to put the case on and take it off.<br/><br/>The case features a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app whether the iPhone is locked or unlocked. A quick press of the button takes a photo and a longer press captures QuickTake video. It works for selfies, too.<br/><br/>The Smart Battery Case is also compatible with Qi-certified chargers. You can charge your iPhone and battery case simultaneously. And when fully charged, the Smart Battery Case delivers up to 50% longer battery life.* This results in increased talk time, internet use, and even longer audio and video playback. With the Smart Battery Case on, the intelligent battery status is displayed on the iPhone Lock screen and in Notification Center, so you know exactly how much charge you have left.<br/>The case can be charged even faster with USB-PD-compatible chargers. It also supports Lightning accessories, such as the EarPods with Lightning Connector (included with your iPhone) or the Lightning Digital AV Adapter (sold separately).<br/>-----<br/><br/>You can purchase the Smart Battery Case for $129 from the links below!<br/>● <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVJ2LL/A/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-soft-white">iPhone 11 Smart Battery Case with Wireless Charging</a><br/>● <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVN2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-pink-sand">iPhone 11 Pro Smart Battery Case with Wireless Charging</a><br/>● <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVP2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-max-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11 Pro Max Smart Battery Case with Wireless Charging</a></p>
