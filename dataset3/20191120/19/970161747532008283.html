        <b>It only took 30 years, but The Cranberries have been nominated for their first-ever Grammy award.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Irish rock band have been shortlisted for Best Rock Album at the Grammy Awards 2020 – and we’re literally crying with joy.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the band released their final album as a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/15/cranberries-lead-singer-dolores-oriordan-dies-aged-46-7231170/">tribute to their late singer Dolores O’Rioirdan</a> and we know she’d be so proud.</p>
      <p>The album, In The End, has been nominated along with albums from Bring Me The Horizon, Cage The Elephant, I Prevail and Rival Sons.</p>
      <p>Guitarist Noel Hogan, bassist Mike Hogan, and drummer Fergal Lawler conjured up vocal demos that were recorded by the lead singer before she died in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Their first single All Over Now from the album was released on the anniversary of her death.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, pop artists like Billie Eilish, Lizzo, and Taylor Swift are among the stars who are leading the Grammy nominations ahead of the anticipated ceremony.</p>

      <p>Proving to be quite the underdog, Lil Nas X has come up trumps with nods including record of the year for Old Town Road and album of the year for 7.</p>
