      </p>
      <p>When Gordon Sondland walked into the congressional impeachment hearing shortly after 9am, reports were circulating that the Trump administration and the Republican party was going to throw him under the bus for his part the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine">Ukraine</a> scandal, painting him as a hotelier turned diplomat who went rogue.</p>
      <p>The question was whether Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, would take the fall. In his eagerness to please the president, had he coordinated a parallel Ukraine policy to convince the Ukrainians to investigate Trump’s political opponent, Joe Biden?</p>
      <p>But Trump and his allies were in for a shock. Any doubt about Sondland’s true intentions evaporated with his opening statement.</p>
      <p>Sondland insisted he had been operating “at the express direction of the president of the United States”. In case there was any residual ambiguity, he added: “So we followed the president’s orders.” Then Sondland produced documentary evidence that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mike-pompeo">Mike Pompeo</a>, the secretary of state, was kept informed about the shakedown scheme to hold back Ukrainian aid in return for investigations.</p>
      <p>Far from allowing himself to be thrown under the bus, Sondland signaled he was prepared, if necessary, to shove everyone around him into the middle of the road. His statement went on to implicate Vice-President Mike Pence, the president’s lawyer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/rudygiuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a>, the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Bolton’s top Russia aide, Tim Morrison. “Everyone was in the loop,” Sondland said, twice.</p>
      <p>By 10am, it was clear they were going to need a bigger bus.</p>
      <p>Sitting in front of an impeachment inquiry, revising his testimony for the third time, his polished bald head glistening in the light of a congressional chandelier, is presumably not what Gordon Sondland had pictured when he donated $1m to Trump’s inauguration celebration nearly three years ago.</p>
      <p>He had backed other Republicans in the 2016 primaries and even denied the Trump campaign use of one of his hotels. So after Trump’s shock win, Sondland was eager to get back on the right side of history. A million bucks got him the ambassador job in Brussels, where he reportedly boasted he had come to “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/us/politics/gordon-sondland-impeachment.html">destroy the European Union</a>”, and quickly got to work upgrading the ambassador’s residence. The $1m in state department funds that he spent included $400,000 for a kitchen and $30,000 for a sound system.</p>
      <p>In Brussels, Sondland made a lot of his personal connection with the president, and arrived in Kyiv in spring making it clear to other diplomats he was there to do Trump’s bidding. In October, Trump signaled his continued backing by going on Twitter to describe his ambassador as “a really good man and great American”.</p>
      <p>But since Sondland has decided to testify, Trump’s memory of him has faded dramatically. “I hardly know the gentleman,” he said earlier this month.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, after Sondland’s unambiguous opening statement implicating the president in the strong-arming of Ukrainian government, Trump went out on the White House south lawn to underline the tenuous nature of their acquaintance, lest there be any doubt.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know him very well. I have not spoken to him much. This is not a man I know well. He seems like a nice guy, though,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>At pretty much exactly the same time on Capitol Hill, Sondland was giving a far warmer assessment of his familiarity with Trump. He confirmed the testimony of other witnesses that he had called Trump from a Kyiv restaurant on 26 July (as other US diplomats leaned in to hear, and waiters came and went) telling the president that Zelenskiy “loves your ass”.</p>
      <p>Asked about the accuracy of the exchange, Sondland said: “It sounds like something I would say. That’s how President Trump and I communicate. A lot of four-letter words. Or three-letter words, in this case.”</p>
      <p>He went on to say that talking to the president was so commonplace it was hard for him to recall the details of particular conversations.</p>
      <p>More importantly, Sondland did not dispute another witness’s account of the phone call, which described Trump as interrogating Sondland about whether the Ukrainians were going to carry out the required investigations, and Sondland assuring the president that his Ukrainian counterpart would “do anything you ask of him”.</p>
      <p>The demeanor of the Republicans on the House intelligence committee grew grimmer with every passing hour of Sondland’s testimony. Their own interrogation of the ambassador only seemed to make things worse.</p>
      <p>The Republican counsel, Stephen Castor, focused on a Sondland conversation with Trump in September in which the president insisted he wanted nothing from Ukraine, there was no “quid pro quo”.</p>
      <p>“You believed the president, right?” Castor asked.</p>
      <p>“I’m not going to characterize whether I believed or didn’t believe,” Sondland said.</p>
      <p>From his pained expression, Castor was clearly aware that he had broken the trial lawyer’s maxim: never ask a question to which you don’t already know the answer.</p>
      <p>He phrased his questions in several different ways, but Sondland was adamant that the quid pro quo that Ukraine was offered in Trump’s name had started off clear, and became clearer as the summer went on. In the leaden phrase suggested by the committee chair, Adam Schiff, it was a “continuum of insidiousness”. If there is ever a bad movie made about Sondland’s journey from hospitality king of the north-west coast to four-letter-word Trump confidant to impeachment witness, that would make a perfect title.</p>
