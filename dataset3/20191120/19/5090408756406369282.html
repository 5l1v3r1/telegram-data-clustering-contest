      <p>The future of retail is here, and it’s not in shopping malls.</p>
      <p>In the last ten years, the way we shop, eat, and exercise has transformed drastically. Sure, malls may be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/american-retail-apocalypse-in-photos-2018-1">dying</a> along with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/death-of-american-dream-transforms-restaurant-industry-2019-10">American dream</a>. But out of their ashes arise a shiny new cohort of brands that live online, whose digital presence is exponentially more important than their physical presence.</p>
      <p>Consumers are more aware than ever how their purchasing choices affect the world around them. As a result, the brands that have taken over retail during the last decade reflect the socially and environmentally conscious values of the newest consumer generation, as well as the increasingly digital lifestyles they lead.</p>
      <p>From Casper to Glossier, these 12 new brands transformed the face of retail over the last 10 years.</p>

      <p>Before <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/swell-water-bottle-ceo-sarah-kauss-2016-6">S’well</a> launched in 2010, water bottles were mostly functional tools. But S’well turned the water bottle into a sleek, upscale fashion piece and identity statement. S’well positioned its drop-shaped bottle as a mascot for the war against plastic bottles, even though reusable bottles have been displacing plastic ones long before S’well came into the picture.</p>
