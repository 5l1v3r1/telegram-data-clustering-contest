      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">President Donald Trump</a> told reporters on the White House lawn Wednesday that he didn’t make any requests from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and that there was no “quid pro quo” for Ukraine to investigate former <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-joe-biden-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Vice President Joe Biden</a> and his son Hunter in exchange for military aid.</p>
      <p>He dismissed <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11">today’s impeachment testimony</a> from Gordon Sondland, his handpicked ambassador to the European Union who also donated $1 million to his inauguration fund. In October, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181560708808486914">Trump called Sondland</a> “a really good man and great American.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know him very well. I haven’t spoken to him very much. This is not a man I know well,” Trump said of Sondland. “Seems like a nice guy, though.”</p>
      <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-zelensky-ukraine-call-transcript-quid-pro-quo-biden-2019-9">the White House-produced memo of Trump’s call with Zelensky</a> – which Trump frequently insists everyone read – show that Trump asks Zelensky to do him a “favor” and speak to his attorney general about investigating the Bidens. Five witnesses in the impeachment inquiry so far have testified under oath that Trump wanted the investigation in exchange for military aid, which Trump also discussed in the call, as part of a “quid pro quo.”</p>
      <p>Trump made the comments about Sondland while reading from notes written in giant Sharpie lettering on Air Force One stationary.</p>
      <p>“I want nothing. I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing. This is the final word from the Pres of the U.S.,” the notes say.</p>

      <p>He also <a href="https://twitter.com/AaronBlake/status/1197209371308109824">appeared to hold a piece of paper with a single tweet printed out on it</a>, where a Reuters White House correspondent cites Sondland saying that aid for Ukraine – already authorized by Congress – would be released only on the condition that Ukraine investigated the Bidens.</p>

      <p>Trump <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/what-if-donald-trump-is-just-blind.html">reportedly has poor eyesight</a> but refuses to wear glasses in public. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-dislikes-tweeting-publicly-reading-glasses-2019-11">According to the New York Times</a>, he doesn’t tweet in front of other people because he doesn’t want them to see him with his glasses on.</p>
