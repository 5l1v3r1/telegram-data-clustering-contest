      <p>After announcing that it would make this change back in 2018, <a href="https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a58092/dunkin-donuts-eliminates-styrofoam-cups/">Dunkin’ is finally doing away with its Styrofoam cups</a>. Yes, the iconic cup is useful for not scalding your fingers while carrying your oversized hot chocolate while also balancing two dozen doughnuts<b> </b>for your English students (or maybe that’s just me). But given that <a href="https://www.sustainablebusinesstoolkit.com/styrofoam-environmental-impact/">Styrofoam is non-biodegradable</a> and therefore damaging to the environment, a lot of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/styrofoam-ban-states-declare-war-people-think-it-breaks-down/">states have been banned this material</a>. To keep ahead of that curve, <a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/11/18/20970447/dunkin-donuts-switch-from-foam-to-paper-cups">Dunkin’ is replacing its Styrofoam cups</a> with double-walled paper versions, Eater reports.</p>
      <p>Dunkin' is planning <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/blog/double-walled-paper-cup-dunkin">replace its foam cups</a> in New England stores by Dec. 1. When Dunkin' originally announced the change in February 2018, the company said in a statement on its website that it plans to bring <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/dunkin-donuts-to-eliminate-foam-cups-worldwide-in-2020">new paper cups</a> across its franchise “with a targeted completion date of 2020.” The double-walled paper cups being brought in to replace the old cups are made with paperboard that’s been certified by the <a href="https://www.sfiprogram.org/sfistandards/">Sustainable Forestry Initiative Standard</a>, a sustainability organization working to unite forest-based conservation with community-based environmental plans.</p>
      <p>According to Dunkin’, this move to keep non-biodegradable materials out of landfills is just one of several environmental initiatives the company has been working on. Dunkin’ has also joined the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, a project working towards making coffee the world's first sustainable agriculture project; is working on eliminating <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/releases-20190729">artificial dyes</a> from its menu; and <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/dunkin-donuts-launches-dd-greenTM-an-initiative-to-build-sustainable-and-energy-efficient-restaurants">building more energy-efficient restaurants</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, the loss of the foam cups may be bittersweet for those who grew up with them. There is such a very <i>particular </i>Dunkin’ foam cup feeling, aesthetic, and even sound (you know the sound I mean). But don’t be too sad just yet. In a new statement on its website, Dunkin' promised that the new paper cups, because they are double-walled, will mean you still don't need <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/blog/double-walled-paper-cup-dunkin">a sleeve to go around your coffee order</a>. What's more, your drink will still be capped with the same classic re-closable lid, which also comes with its own aesthetic and set of sounds. You’ll still be able to get that Dunkin’ feel — now, it’ll just come with fewer environmental implications, which tastes even better than your morning coffee anyway.</p>
