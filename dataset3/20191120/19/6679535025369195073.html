      <h1>Nothing political about Pawar-Modi meeting: NCP</h1>

      <p>Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s visit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday was not political but to inform Mr. Modi about the agrarian distress in the State, the party’s chief spokesperson Nawab Malik.</p>
      <p>Mr. Pawar’s visit to the PM, prior to the meeting of Congress and NCP leaders in Delhi, sparked speculation amid murmurs of the possibility of the NCP and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) joining hands to form a government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <h3>Letter to PM</h3>
      <p>The NCP, however, clarified that no such step is possible and the meeting was not to discuss politics. In a letter written to Mr. Modi, Mr. Pawar said, “This year, the unseasonal rainfall [has] created havoc engulfing 325 talukas of Maharashtra causing heavy damage [to] crops over 54.22 lakh hectares.”</p>
      <p>He described the conditions as alarming. “This year, the returning monsoon devastated almost every standing crop in the larger part of Maharashtra,” the letter said. He sought the Prime Minister’s urgent intervention as the State is under President’s Rule.</p>
      <p>Mr. Malik said, “There is no basis to the talk of the BJP and NCP coming together. It will not happen. Today’s meeting was only to discuss the farmers’ situation in Maharashtra. No one should draw any conclusions from it,” he said.</p>
