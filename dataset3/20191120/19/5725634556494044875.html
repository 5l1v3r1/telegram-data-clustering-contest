        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you, Rene, and thanks everyone for joining our earnings call today. As already mentioned, Ms. Selina Yang, Chief Financial Officer is currently on maternity leave.</p>
      <p>So you can see on slide three, we now have a new member in our management family and her name is Iris [ph] and we’ll all say hello to everyone and apologize for causing some delay for you this time.</p>
      <p>Now, please turn to slide, page number six. I'm pleased to report our 2019 third quarter results; our seventh consecutive quarter of solid operating and financial performance. We grew our geographic coverage to 309 cities across China by the end of September, up from 278 cities by the end of September of 2018, a 11.2% year-over-year growth. We now have 3,102 hotels in operation, a 21.3% year-over-year increase across 12 expanding the economy, mid-scale, mid-to-up-scale, and luxury brand.</p>
      <p>Total revenue growth was 20.1% year-over-year to RMB292.1 million. Gross profit increased 21.4% to RMB204.9 million. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA rose 11.6% to RMB177.1 million and the core net income per ADS ,that’s basic and diluted non-GAAP improved by 16.5% to RMB1.3 which is equivalent to US$0.18.</p>
      <p>Operating performance also remains solid, especially compared to the overall performance of the Chinese Hospitality Sector according to STR report. Our Blended average daily run rate increased by 4.2% year-over-year to RMB174. Occupancy rate had a slide 1.3% in place to 85.9%, primarily due to 250 in existing hotels in renovation. The accelerated new hotel openings in the quarter, as well as our lower occupancy rate in our luxury segment; however revenue per available room increased 2.7% year-over-year to RMB149.</p>
      <p>Moving to slide number seven; at the end of the quarter we operated a 3,102 hotels into 1.3% higher than a year ago. 30 of these hotels were leased and operated or L&amp;O hotels and 3,072 franchise and managed or F&amp;M hotels. While the mid-scale segment remains the core of our business with more than 73.8% of our hotels, we are diversifying our portfolio by adding hotels in both the higher end and the economy segment of the market. The number of hotels in the luxury segment and mid-to-up-scale segment increased to 6.2% of the total portfolio and the economy segment grew to 20%.</p>
      <p>Turning to slide number eight; we opened 181 hotels compared to 146 hotels in the third quarter of 2018, that’s a 24% increase. Three of those new openings were in the luxury segment, 20 were in the mid-to-up-scale segment, 92 were in the mid-scale segment and 66 were in the economy segment. 16 of the newly opened hotels were in Tier 1 cities, 32 in Tier 2 cities and the remaining 127 in select Tier 3 cities and other cities in China.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we closed 34 hotels: 15 due to brand upgrade, and the 13 due to non-compliance with our company’s brand and operating standards; the remaining six due to property related issues. So net-net we added 147 hotels to our portfolio. We are proud that we actually only closed 19 hotels in this quarter, because almost all franchisees have been benefited from our operation and support.</p>
      <p>Turning to slide number nine; our pipeline of new hotels also increased from 596 on June 30 to 652 on September 30. Around 26.8% of these hotels are in mid-to-up scale and the luxury segment, 39.6% are in mid-scale and around 33.6% in the economy sector.</p>
      <p>Slide number 10 summarizes some of the key operating metrics. We continue to see improved operating performance across the board. The key numbers to look at here are the purple bars representing the performance of our F&amp;M hotels. Our F&amp;M hotels, ADR improved to 4.2% to RMB173.</p>
      <p>RevPAR increased to 2.6% to RMB149, while the occupancy rate had decreased from 87.5% to 86.1%. The performance of our L&amp;O hotels also with ADR up 6.8% to RMB224; F&amp;M, L&amp;O hotels come back online after the completion of the renovations.</p>
      <p>Slide 11 shows our RevPAR trend. We delivered a 7.5% year-over-year increase in RevPAR for our L&amp;O hotels to RMB164, while RevPAR for our F&amp;M hotels increased by 2.6% to RMB149.</p>
      <p>Let's turn to slide 12. Another critical area for our business is our loyalty program. Ours is a paid program in which members enjoy a variety of premium products and benefits, especially after the company integrated a membership programs with several partners, including Da Niang Dumplings, Gourmet Noodle House, Yibon Hotel Group and so on. This enables members to use membership points and benefits interchangeable. Our loyalty program helps us foster closer relationships with our guests who can book with us directly, therefore reducing sales and marketing fees and expense.</p>
      <p>Overall, we now have about 39 million individual members and 1.45 million corporate members, up from approximately 36 million and 1.38 million as of June 30 and our members are very loyal customers. During the quarter, around 93.1% of all room nights were sold directly, primarily due to our individual and corporate members.</p>
      <p>Now, let me talk about a few recent developments that you can find on slide number 13. We added 23 mid-to-upscale and the luxury hotels, including Argyle, GreenTree Eastern, Gme, Gya, VX and also Tallas [ph] hotels. At the end of this quarter we had 21 Argyle, 22 Gme, 18 Gya and 19 VX hotels in the pipeline as we continue our accelerating expansion into the mid-to-upscale and the luxury segments.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we are very proud of our company’s strong performance, in particular a meaningful increase in sales and a strong guest preference delivered by our diversified band portfolio, especially in the light of the shifting Chinese economy.</p>
      <p>We remain confident in our business model, strategic positioning and our long-term growth strategies. We will continue to invest in our people, brand, system and technology in order to better serve our guests and franchisees and to ensure the healthy development of our companies for the long-run.</p>
      <p>With that, I will pass the floor over to our Director of IT, Megan Huang, who will summarize our financial performance and fourth quarter to you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Megan Huang</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you, Alex. Let me refer you to slide 15 where you can see that our combined total revenues grew 20.1% year-over-year to RMB292.1 million, primarily due to three factors; the opening of 180 F&amp;M hotels and 1 L&amp;O hotel, improved RevPAR growth in F&amp;M and L&amp;O hotels and the growth in our loyalty membership program.</p>
      <p>Growth was partially offset by the renovation of 6 L&amp;O hotels during the quarter. Total revenues from F&amp;M hotels rose 19.2% to RMB219.6 million, while our total revenue from L&amp;O hotels rose 22.9% to RMB72.6 million.</p>
      <p>On the same slide, during the first nine months of 2019, total revenues rose by 20.6% to RMB802.4 million. Total revenues from F&amp;M hotels were RMB617.5 million, up by 21.2% year-over-year and the total revenues from L&amp;O hotels were RMB184.9 million, up by 18.5% year-over-year.</p>
      <p>Moving to slide 16, the cost and expense side of the P&amp;L. Hotel operating costs were RMB87.3 million, up 17.1% year-over-year, which is mainly attributable to costs associated with the expansion of our F&amp;M hotels, including staff costs; consumables, higher depreciation and amortization. Higher long time renovation costs related to the renovation of six L&amp;O hotels and the 250 F&amp;M hotels, as well as the operation costs of Argyle. These were currently offset by the closure of one L&amp;O hotel. For the first nine months of this year hotel operating costs were RMB246.2 million, up 21.6%.</p>
      <p>Selling and marketing expenses were RMB20.8 million, up 71.3% year-over-year, mainly attributable to the internship owners to hotel staff and operation team. The operation of the newly-added hotel brands, such as increased advertising and the promotion expenses to improve our brand recognition, and increase personnel, compensation and other costs. Selling and marketing expenses for the first nine months of 2019 were RMB61.8 million, up 84.4% year-over-year.</p>
      <p>General and administrative expenses were RMB39.9 million, up 54.6% year-over-year, mainly because of increased IT research and the development costs; headquarter staff costs, legal, DD, M&amp;A and other consulting fee; increase of share-based payment, as well as the G&amp;A expense of Argyle. General and administrative expenses for the first nine months were RMB105.4 million, up 51% year-over-year. Overall, combined total operating costs and expenses grew 33.4% year-over-year to RMB148 million.</p>
      <p>On slide 17 you can see that gross profit grew 21.4 % year-over-year to RMB204.9 million. Gross margin increased to 70.1%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.6% year-over-year to RMB177.1 million and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 4.6% to 68.6%.</p>
      <p>Moving onto slide 18. In this quarter net income decreased to 28.4% to RMB102.2 million and the net margin was 35%. The decrease was primarily due to market fluctuations in our investment portfolio and increase in total operating costs and expenses. Core net income increased 16.5% to RMB134.8 million and core net margin decreased by 1.4% to 46.2%.</p>
      <p>Let’s look at slide 19. Net income per ADS, basic and diluted deceased by 28.4% to RMB1.01, equal to US$0.14, while core net income per ADS, basic and diluted non-GAAP improved by 15.9% to RMB1.32 equal to US$0.18. In the first nine months of this year net income per ADS, basic and diluted, improved by 9.9% to RMB3.6, equals to US$0.50, while core net income per ADS, basic and diluted non-GAAP improved by 12.7% to RMB3.46 equals to US$0.48.</p>
      <p>Moving on to slide 20. During the first nine months of 2019 our operating net cash inflow was RMB395.5 million. As of September 30 we had cash and cash equivalence of almost RMB2.1 billion. This provides us with ample resources as we continue to evaluate additional potential investments and acquisitions and we do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital at this stage.</p>
      <p>Lastly, in terms of guidance, we expect total revenue for the full year 2019 to grow 22% to 25% from 2018. The change was due to delayed consolidation on urban and the speed-up of our renovation program.</p>
      <p>This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&amp;A session. Thanks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Question-and-Answer Session</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Operator</b>
      </p>
      <p>[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ken Chong of Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ken Chong</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hi management for talking my question. Congratulations on the results and I just want to ask about your RevPAR Look towards the third quarter. It’s good to see that in the third quarter, we still delivered positive RevPAR growth.</p>
      <p>I'm just wondering for the fourth quarter now, we’re already in late November. Do you have any colors on the RevPAR trends, on policy like when we have a profound by remaining occupancy. And the second question is more from the tracks from inner places like OYO and they expand so many economy hotels under their soft brands and do we see the need to open more in our stand as well to sustain our market share. Thank you very much.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks Ken, great questions, and let’s talk about the first quarter – the fourth quarter first. At this moment, the costs we discussed before we have a value priced business model and we are trying to work really hard to focus on the direct sales. We have a loyal customer base as a results, and we see if our RevPAR will be you know completely stable or will be improved slightly for the fourth quarter of this year. And that however, we will speed up the renovations, because after renovations we clearly see the major improvement after they brought the CapEx and after the slight up-grade in certain hotels.</p>
      <p>So during this renovation period, we may see some massive impact towards occupancy and ADR. And so excluding the impact of that, we should be able to see some gradual and some small slight increase of the performance over the same quarter last year.</p>
      <p>So, so far we have not been inactively impacted by our – you know some of the concerns from our you know customers and. And that fee second question, regarding the softer brand, and the entry to that. We did see – there’s a lot of changes in that area. However, our belief is still the brand should have a certain value, that is standardize or quality services through your, both to your guest and though our franchisees and so that both of them have to be happy, and so we will not hand a higher, you know that high quality at that end.</p>
      <p>So, in order to make sure we have a sustainable growth and we certainly do not want to have up and down for our future growth. So we have been really careful in terms of monitoring that program, and the market is very – you know the markets of China, the hospitality was huge. So I think that there is ample opportunity, and whoever can do a job consistently and continue the same high quality, I think eventually we’ll succeed. So that why Ken we have continued to maintain our standard in our development.</p>
      <p>We have not added a lot of non-soft brand products. But as I said, that we are monitoring that, we evaluate that and we also added some development personnel, as well as the operation personal and we are training them to see whether we need to add more, just in case we need to add a more softer brand. It’s like a need to form our existing franchisees for the next year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ken Chong</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sure. Thank you very much.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Operator</b>
      </p>
      <p>[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Nate Deng of China Renaissance. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nate Deng</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hi management! Thank you for taking my question and congratulations to the great result and congratulations to Selina and Erick. I have three questions if I may. The first one is about the operation hitchhike. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on the same account’s RevPAR growth in this quarter and what is it like by [inaudible] and maybe the first one comes first.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>For the same hotels, let me take a look at the numbers, because – for the same hotels I believe we have a RevPAR, the mid-scale at the top 2.3% and economy up to 3.6% and the mid to up-scale collectively was down 3.7%. So that's basically the RevPAR like growth and that’s all organic, whereas our consolidated then is rated now by the following: For luxury we’re obviously flat, mid to upscale 0.2% decrease; mid-scale is a 2.3% increase and economy is a 3.6% increase, that’s on RevPAR.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nate Deng</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, thank you, thank you. And the other question is about our billing expense hike, because we have seen a significant increase in the extra rate cost. So maybe can you give us a little bit more color on the breakdown of say IT development on – as that is tough on end marketing for new friends and going forward shall we – what is the kind of normalized EBITDA margin shall we expect?</p>
      <p>
        <b>A - Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, so thanks Nate for those two questions. So the timing on marketing expenses, we have basically three components there. One component is the Argyle consultation and that has contributed to about 1% of the increase and we think that factor will be gone by the next year. And then the following 50%, roughly about – we had one-time selling expenses because we have. This is a 15 year anniversary. We have done some promotions and that roughly has close to $6 million in that expense and then I think that’s up 47%.</p>
      <p>Excluding those two major items and then there are miscellaneous activities, our core sales to marketing, regular sales to marketing expenses only increased 2.9% and so regarding to the DNA, again that’s about three areas. One is Argyle consolidation, which contributes to about 7.1% increase out of that total number, and then you know the RMB, this quarter we spent $5.7 million and so we amortized that so that even with that we have an increase of RMB4 million in that RMB, so that's like 16.7%, about 17%.</p>
      <p>So deleted all of that, I think then we also have prioritized admissions here; the cost of adding the development and operation in preparation for the next years, and the higher speed of growth. But we did not – we think that’s regular expense and that bit of growth and the speed of increase will be slowed down.</p>
      <p>So excluding those it’s going to be less than 47%. Then, we also have you know the continuous evaluation like a consulting fee, DD’s and that various advisory costs that’s a little bit higher because we’re evaluating systematically some opportunity and that that is a 10% increase, so deleting all of that. So the net core G&amp;A is about 30% increase. So Nate, that’s our break down.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nate Deng</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you. Thank you management for the detailed explanation and congrats on the results, thank you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Operator</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next question comes from Colin Yao of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Colin Yao</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks management for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong results. I basically have two questions: The first one will be regarding the same hotel RevPAR. So comparatively speaking, it seems GreenTree has been delivering very resilient performance in terms of same hotel RevPAR. I'd like to know, comparing to your peers, why GreenTree over performed competitively speaking.</p>
      <p>And also my second question will be for the expansion in mid-scale and upscale segments. Since you are seeing ample cash resources, would you be considering opening out more lease on hotels or seeking some mid to high end hotel investment opportunities, both domestically and globally. Yeah, so here are my two questions.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, so the first question regarding our performance in terms of our peers, we really have not compared with our peers that closely, because we think that we use a business model that value pricing I think is our key and the payer fusion through the need of our loyal team members, our profit memberships with their need, so we do not for instance address our price constantly.</p>
      <p>And we have basically a value pricing model and because of the economy, the shifting, we can’t – because of the change of the shifting of the economy, I think that both corporate travellers as well as individual travellers are that in conscious we’re in the traveller budget. So we have always believed in the end value price of products and services will be in a great demand.</p>
      <p>And secondly that we have – as we have said to you before and we developed the strength in our membership development programs, we have strength in our marketing programs, we targeted our membership sales and marketing. We also have one of a kind, because our parent company has a restaurant chain, which we have more than close to 100 million and 100 million visitors per year, where we can use the point of contact to market our brand and so a combination of all of that and make the sales and marketing programs more effective. I think that it also stabilized and in the more volatile market our AVR occupancy and therefore the RevPAR, so I think those are the key factors.</p>
      <p>And with regard to the second question, we are evaluating opportunities and the clients who deploy our cash responsibly in to further grow our China market, so we are monitoring that and we think there will be a great opportunity ahead and so that if we have you know strategically located properties and also well priced, they will to selectively our own lease and operated hotels, our own hotels.</p>
      <p>So that, globally we believe our strength, management’s strength and the core competencies are based in China. So unless those opportunities are coming to us from our franchisees or from our customers, we will not divert our focus to elsewhere and I think the opportunities here in China and also the fear of influence such as nearby China. So our focus of growth for the next few years are continuing to be focused in domestically. We think the market has been – will be really, really good and there will be ample opportunities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Colin Yao</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay, thank you very much and congratulations again on the strong results. Thanks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Operator</b>
      </p>
      <p>The next question comes from Jisheng Liu of CLSA. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jisheng Liu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hey, thank you operator. Thank you, Alex, Megan and Nicky for taking the questions. I have a couple of questions, maybe two quick ones first. First one was on the guidance for 2019. I noticed that you have put a new revenue guidance of 20% to 25% year-on-year growth into 2019 versus 2018. I was just wondering if this is only on organic basis?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Primarily, and see that includes the number of months of the consolidation of Argyle, but I think that we, there will be very much delayed urban and consolidation, that's probably less than one month or less. So primarily, you can see primarily some organic growth.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jisheng Liu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. The second, at the end of second quarter '19 you actually said the revenue of 2019 was expected to grow by 23% to 28% from 2018, so by that time actually Urban was already – sorry, Argyle was already consolidated. So I was just wondering so if that guidance was actually so 20% to 25% of revenue growth for this quarter, which was announced for 2019 target. So that would be rather considered as a top line growth guide now in that sense. So if that were an issue, it means that our fourth quarter implied revenue growth will be much slower. So why was that actually?</p>
      <p>

      <p>Initially, we anticipated that we will have a consolidation of Urban for the entire fourth quarter, but that will be delayed for two months or so, so which will have a negative impact on the revenue growth for M&amp;A.</p>
      <p>And secondly that we, as I mentioned to you that we speeded up. We feel that during the transition period they speed up the existing hotels renovation that is very important. So we have a renovation program, aggressive program that’s being implemented and so we have a higher – we will have a higher number of hotels being renovated.</p>
      <p>So we do not necessarily want to force the closure of our hotels and we want to give and incentivize our franchisee to renovate during this period of time. So due to these two factors and the reduction of the growth, the revenue from consolidation, from the M&amp;A and also the speed of this renovation and we will see that the guidance will drop 3%.</p>
      <p>

      <p>Got it, that's very clear, thanks. Second one was – because you just mentioned you have been adding development personnel’s. So may I know how many personnel’s in development did you actually have by the end of, let's say June until 2019. And how many do you have like just now, and how many do we plan to add in future actually? Any color would be helpful.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sorry, if that - based on my memory, I think that in this quarter we – in the third quarter we added about - because we're screening those. We come and our development personnel will come in for three months, for six months. Sure, there is a trial period, because not everyone can be made for full time. After the training this can be a full time DD person.</p>
      <p>So I think the last quarter, we have hired close to 45 personnel’s and at the end of the third quarter we also have squeezed out quite a bit. So at the end of the third quarter, I think we have about 200 plus or minus DD personnel. It is the training and also that it is the screening process that costs a great deal and so that's the number. And while this quarter we plan to add another 40 so by the year end, we think we should have 240 to 250, that's our plan.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jisheng Liu</b>

      <p>Great, thanks. And the third question, I actually know that some of your brands, actually two, may have been going through a rebrand exercise. So Argyle actually in the apprentice of last quarter the name was Argyle only and this quarter it has become Argyle Grand Hotel and for GME Hotel, last quarter it was GME Hotel, this quarter it was renamed to GEM Hotel. So if my understanding was right, you are actually doing some rebranding exercises also.</p>
      <p>So may we get a percentage, what's the rationale behind that, because if there is no real economic impact I think franchisees may get pretty confused, because previously they have one brand and now the brand has actually changed a little bit. So how – what's the rationale behind it if any color could be shared on this? Thanks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>That's a great question. No, there is no, actually - there is no change of the brand in any of those. The logo is Chinese. I think that Argyle always have the Argyle and then we have a brand, they have a lot of other things that depending on the property type.</p>
      <p>So as far as – I think we just used the representatives, ones with the most representative, the hotel brand there. In terms of our Gem, you know [inaudible], that's always out and we say that GEMEI and then people here would lead a couple of them on the English side, on GME and Gem, and I think our guest like for Gem, for gems that's spelled correctly, that our English – you know that there are customers and investors.</p>
      <p>So that's the English side that we just slightly modified, those are our brands, but there is no brand changes to our major customers in China. So apologize for the confusion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jisheng Liu</b>

      <p>No worries, thanks. Maybe just a little, the last little element to check with you; actually last year during fourth quarter you actually paid out a dividend. So should we expect any dividend during the next quarter and if there is, what amount should we expect for next quarter? Thanks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>We have announced a plan for a dividend policy, we would I think stick to that for the time being, unless announced otherwise.</p>
      <p>

      <p>[Operator Instructions] I see we have a follow-up from Nate Deng of China Renaissance. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Nate Deng</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks Alex. Maybe one follow-up question about our strategy, because I think previously some were asking about their OYO soft brand impact and we are also seeing major China Hotel Groups saying they're going to penetrate into lower-tier cities. So my question is, how are we projecting this increasing competition in the lower-tier cities, which is our target market.</p>
      <p>And are we expecting some kind of increased competition and maybe lower, maybe price work, something like that to happen. And shall we expect the cost of developing new hotels to increase in the future and how are we going to cope with it? Thank you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thanks Nate. It's a great question. We clearly see there are more opportunities in the third-tier and the fourth fifth tier cities in China. And the first-tier and second-tier, the brand penetration is much is much higher. So we are going through the third, fourth, fifth tier and the demand for the management resource is much higher.</p>
      <p>I think that there is a price war right now in terms of the initial brand application fees, the initial fees a lot of people will give you a lot of discount and there is a competition at that end. We are clearly also seeing that impact, so we have adjusted our fees to position ourselves and compete effectively. But so far I think that because our positive performance and that because franchisee hotel owner can see our sustained and profitability and performance.</p>
      <p>So we have the development 50% as we said more than 50%. Its driven by our existing franchisees and the new openings and referrals. So we're pretty confident that number will continue and will potentially next year further increase. And we have a trained in the past consistently, our operating managers to be able to be sent through the third fourth tier cities.</p>
      <p>We have the largest I think number of area managers in the company. And so we are – we think we are uniquely positioned to do a better job in the third, fourth and fifth tier city, because as we said the fee revenue, the ADR and there is a ceiling in that end, and so the operating efficiency and assistance and the support, the logistics are crucial to make the hotel operation profitable and sustainable.</p>
      <p>So, in that end, we believe we are uniquely positioned and qualified. So we're not really concerned a lot more competition. In the past 10 years, we do see in the past 15 years. Some brands come and go and it is the solid operator who will continue to deliver the performance to the franchisee, will be the one to stay.</p>

      <p>[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Billy Ng of Bank of America. Please go ahead.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Billy Ng</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hi Alex. Just have a follow-up on that question. Would you mind to tell us what do you think about the current advise? Like you do mention the competition become a little bit more intense, but of course, we do believe GreenTree is very well positioned on that. But in terms of like profitability of the franchisees, how do you see your own franchisees profitability compared to a year ago.</p>
      <p>And also maybe in terms of overall industry, how profitable or not profitable at this stage and as a result in 2020, whether you think there will be bigger opportunities for you guys to get and to help those and [inaudible] operators out there to join the franchise or in general, it will be a very tough environment for everyone. So like the incentive to open new hotels are low? And how – what stage are we in at this point?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Xu</b>
      </p>
      <p>Okay. So Billy, thank you so much for the questions. For our franchisees, our profitability has been very stable, because in order to operate in a profitable cost. It goes through a lot of preparation from design and the construction cost, pre-opening cost, operating cost, the sales and marketing cost and also your – you know the ability to have direct sales forces in addition to work with so many online players there.</p>
      <p>So it is a comprehensive sales and marketing and management skill set the team has to have to deliver a return for our franchisees. So for our existing hotels, you know with no need for renovations, our profitability stays the same and our original plans, the investment return period of three to 2.5 years and I think was still in that range for many hotels.</p>
      <p>We have hotels – older hotels that need to be renovated and that they will be more impacted by a newly opened hotel nearby, so they have a reduced performance. So that is why, and there are return – in other words, their profitability can reduced, but most of them are already, the capital paid back years ago.</p>
      <p>So they are in the best position to reinvest some of the dollars to renovate and since then their profitability will come back, because what we designed in terms of the hotel products and pricing really meet the core demand for the everyday leisure and business travelers, so that is about 108 according to China's hotel statistics. The average hotel space is about $177. So we really want to target the mid-market and divest the great demand.</p>
      <p>So the majority of our franchisees profitability remain the same, and that’s why I think they are enthused about the upcoming opportunities and that they are developing more hotels. And so we anticipate that next year we should sustain a higher speed of growth. And we have gone through that in 2009, 2010 and I think our growth really have not been impacted that much.</p>
      <p>In terms of growing in the future about economy conditions, we think that because there is a pressure on terms of debt, in terms of the debt services for many small and medium-sized corporation and even for some, we've seen some the household debt level increase, that make put a dent in terms of household expenditures or small business travel budget, but I believe the core demand are still there.</p>
      <p>So as long as that we don't deviate, you know overspend in terms of design and construction and the price of hotel above four or five-stars RevPAR, I think the sector will be very healthy and at least at the sector we stay, and the comparing with a lot of different sectors, I believe the hospitality sector is a really a strong via its industry and we're really blest to begin it hopefully.</p>
