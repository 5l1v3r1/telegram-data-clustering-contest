      <p>SHELBY, N.C. (WBTV) - A teacher at a Cleveland County school was arrested on Wednesday and charged for crimes involving indecent liberties with a student.</p>

      <p>The Cleveland County Sheriff’s Office reported that the other acts involved the use of social media to send ‘lewd and lascivious acts to the student’. These incidents reportedly occurred over a period of 18 months while Baker was employed with the school.</p>
      <p>Baker was given a secured bond of $25,000 upon arrest.</p>
      <p>The investigation into this matter remains active and no further information has been released at this time.</p>
