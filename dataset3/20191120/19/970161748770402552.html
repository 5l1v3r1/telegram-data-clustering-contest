        <b>Caitlyn Jenner has entered the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle this week, with reports alleging that she’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/how-much-is-caitlyn-jenner-being-paid-for-im-a-celebrity-and-what-other-reality-shows-has-she-done-11176164/">charging £500,000 for her stint on the reality TV show</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This proved the butt of one of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/im-celebrity-ant-dec-make-digs-caitlyn-jenners-rumoured-500k-fee-11172629/">Ant and Dec’s jokes</a> during the show, with Dec saying: ‘We’ve got reality TV royalty Caitlyn Jenner. Most people come into the jungle to lose a few pounds…’ before Ant added: ‘But she’s going to be gaining 500,000 of them according to the papers.’</p>
      <p>With that impressive sum, and the fact that Caitlyn and the rest of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caitlyn-jenners-family-exes-kids-kardashians-11180247/">the Kardashian/Jenner family</a> are pop-culture titans, here’s a quick look at what the family are worth.</p>
      <h3>What is Caitlyn Jenner’s net worth?</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn Jenner, who was a gold-medal-winning Olympic athlete before she married Kris Jenner in 1991, is worth $100 million (approximately £77 million) according to <a href="https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/olympians/caitlyn-jenner-net-worth/">Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p>

      <p>Her fortune was no-doubt been impacted by the fact that, in 2007, she began appearing (as Bruce Jenner) in hit reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p>
