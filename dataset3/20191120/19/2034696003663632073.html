        <b>The alleged incident occurred at the city's FlyDSA Arena yesterday evening</b>
      </p>
      <p>A gig-goer has reportedly been scarred for life after being hit by a flare at the Sheffield FlyDSA Arena where <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/liam-gallagher">Liam Gallagher</a> was playing.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thestar.co.uk/news/crime/concertgoer-scarred-life-after-flare-thrown-during-liam-gallagher-gig-sheffields-flydsa-arena-1306404"><i>The Star,</i></a> Stacey Andrew, 27, from Boston, Lincolnshire, was at the venue yesterday evening (November 19) when she was set on fire ahead of the former <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/oasis">Oasis</a> frontman taking to the stage.</p>
      <p>Andrew told the newspaper: “The flare hit my head and fell down my top, at first I didn’t realise what had happened until people shouted.” The incident happened during DMA’s set who were supporting Gallagher.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t realise what had happened then people started patting me. My shirt was in flames and a man ripped it off. People were shouting, ‘She’s on fire!'”</p>

      <p>The victim’s brother later appealed for help via a comment on Gallagher’s Facebook page. “You could have taken my sister away from me and my family tonight,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>In a subsequent post, he added: “I want justice for the pain they have caused my sister because she will now have scars for the rest of her life.” One gig-goer has since shared footage from the alleged incident.</p>
      <p>Later, Gallagher responded to the reports via Twitter while offering his apologies to Andrew. “I’m sorry to hear what happened to Stacey Andrew in Sheffield the other night,” he said, “it’s not cool people need to chill the fuck out with the flares.”</p>
