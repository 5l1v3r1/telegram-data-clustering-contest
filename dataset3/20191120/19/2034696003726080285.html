      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/grimes">Grimes</a> has spoken about the impact of technological developments on live music in a new interview.</p>
      <p>The artist, who now wants to be referred to as <i>c</i>, told <a href="https://art19.com/shows/sean-carrolls-mindscape">Sean Carroll’s <i>Mindscape </i>podcast</a> that she believes the landscape will change because people “don’t actually want the real world”.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>“I think live music is going to be obsolete soon,” she said. <i>c</i> also stated that “DJs get paid more than real musicians”.<br/>“It’s kinda like Instagram or whatever,” she continued. “People are actually just gravitating towards the clean, finished, fake world. Everyone wants to be in a simulation. They don’t actually want the real world. Even if they think they do and everyone’s like, ‘Yeah, cool, live music!’ if you actually look at actual numbers of things, everyone’s gravitating towards the shimmery perfected Photoshop world.”</p>
      <p>The Canadian producer – <a href="https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/grimes-new-album-miss_anthropocene-release-date-tracklist-everything-know-far-2531642">who recently announced that her fifth album ‘Miss_Anthropocene’ will arrive in February</a> – suggested that she would be happy with such a sea change because she doesn’t enjoy playing live.</p>
      <p>“As a performer, I hate the potential of failure in front of a giant audience,” she told Caroll.</p>

      <p>Addressing the topic of artists’ access to and the affordability to physical musical equipment, <i>c</i> added that she feels the world will be hit “a singularity point in 5 or 10 years where you won’t need really anything” but that “there’s things right now that just don’t sound as good if you don’t have hardware.”<br/>Elsewhere in the interview the 31-year-old spoke about “the end of art, human art” in the context of the takeover of AI creativity. “Once there’s actually AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), they’re gonna be so much better at making art than us…once AI can totally master science and art, which could happen in the next 10 years, probably more like 20 or 30 years.”</p>
      <p><i>c</i> went on to detail her idea of using a new digital avatar (possibly named “War Nymph”) as well as how she is “back into breaking the rules” for her forthcoming record.</p>
      <p>For her last album, 2015’s ‘Art Angels’, the musician said she wanted to make a record that would “make it clear that I could play with the boys”. The “male-dominated” world of producing, she added, presented her with a challenge with which to prove her skills.</p>
      <p>“I was a bit more rule-abiding in that album than I would have liked,” she said, before concluding that ‘Miss_Anthropocene’ is her “best work for sure” and “sounds less like other music”.</p>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-to-release-new-song-so-heavy-this-week-2566939#9SyvB8WM1LZsO2bs.99">Grimes released two versions of her new song ‘So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth’</a>.</p>
