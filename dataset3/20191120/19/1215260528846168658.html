        <b>The Child Protection and Family Services Agency (CPFSA), is now accepting applications from Jamaicans for its ‘Take a Child Home for the Holiday’ initiative.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The annual programme provides an opportunity for families to open their homes to wards of the State during the festive season. </p>
      <p>It caters to children three to 18 years old who do not have parents or guardians to take them home during the holiday period.</p>
      <p>Speaking with JIS News, Public Relations and Communications Manager at the CPFSA, Rochelle Dixon, said the agency recognises that children placed in a family environment produce better outcomes.</p>
      <p>Initially, the ‘Take a Child Home for the Holiday’ programme was created for parents who have children in State care to take them home for the festive season.</p>
      <p>However, over time, the programme was extended to persons with good moral standing.</p>
      <p>For the 2018 festive season, parents/guardians or other family members taking children home for the holidays, totalled 182, while 154 applications from members of the public were approved.</p>
      <p>Some 355 children were placed and from this amount 19 were foster-care prospects.</p>
      <p>Dixon explained that persons who qualify for the programme have the option of hosting a child for a day or during a holiday period.                                                </p>
      <h3>How to Apply</h3>
      <p>Persons who are interested in participating in the programme are required to fill out an application form.</p>
      <p>They are also required to provide two references from a Notary Public, such as a police officer, a Justice of the Peace or a school principal;  provide two passport-sized photographs, a valid identification card and must be 25 years or older.</p>
      <p>The approval is granted based on the applicant’s ability to fulfil the criteria outlined, and in some cases approval is at the discretion of the Children’s Officer.</p>
      <p> The application may take up to 20 days to be processed.                                           </p>
      <p>For further information, interested persons may visit any of the CPFSA regional offices, formerly the Child Development Agency (CDA), across the island; telephone the head office at 876-948-2841-2 or e-mail: <a href="mailto:info@childprotection.gov.jm">info@childprotection.gov.jm</a>.</p>
      <p>The deadline for submission of applications is Friday, November 29.</p>
