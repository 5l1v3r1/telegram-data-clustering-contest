      <h1>What Luis Campos has said about working with Jose Mourinho amid Spurs director of football links</h1>
      <h2>Luis Campos is being heavily linked with a move to join Jose Mourinho at Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Luis Campos has previously admitted he would like to have the opportunity to work with Jose Mourinho, amid speculation that the pair will unite at Tottenham.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a>'s arrival in North London was confirmed on Wednesday morning, following the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino the previous evening, and Spurs' business continued to be swift.</p>
      <p>With previous partner Rui Faria now embarking on his own managerial career in Qatar, Mourinho has a new sidekick on his return to the Premier League after capturing the highly-rated Joao Sacromento from Lille, with goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos also arriving from the Ligue 1 side.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a>' raid on Lille is reportedly not over as <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/luis-campos">Campos</a>, currently director of football for the French side, is tipped to move to the Premier League to take the same role with Spurs.</p>
      <p>Such a move would lead to a significant change in Spurs' transfer approach, with Campos working between Mourinho and Daniel Levy, and it seems it is an outcome that could be on the horizon.</p>
      <p>Asked by Sky Sports last month whether he would like to have the opportunity to work with Mourinho, Campos admitted it is something that appeals to him and spoke about the friendship he has with the Portuguese boss.</p>
      <p>“Of course. Mourinho is like a brother to me. I know him very well and for a long time. He’s a wonderful person and the best coach in the world. So, of course, if he called me I would speak,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In my opinion – football needs someone like Jose. Football needs this special coach with this energy and strong personality. I believe the next work of Jose will be his top work.”</p>
