      <h1>'Even more important' - Manager sets Aston Villa struggler a clear challenge</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes update on Andre Green's loan spell at Preston North End</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:20:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Andre Green has been told to earn a starting spot for Preston North End by proving himself in training.</p>
      <p>Green linked up with Preston in early August on a season-long loan designed to give him regular exposure to first-team football.</p>
      <p>But worryingly for <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa,</a> he is yet to make a single start for the Championship side having been limited to just six appearances off the bench.</p>
      <p>Squad competition means it’s difficult for Green – who is currently sidelined with a toe problem – to force his way up the pecking order and into Alex Neil’s plans.</p>

      <p>Preston’s brilliant start to the season – they sit second behind West Brom after 16 matches – adds another layer to the challenge.</p>
      <p>“When you are not in the team your training that week is even more important,” manager Neil told the <a href="https://www.lep.co.uk/sport/football/preston-north-end/pne-news/andre-green-and-others-on-fringes-given-a-challenge-by-preston-north-end-boss-alex-neil-1-10110074">Lancashire Evening Post.</a></p>
      <p>“That is their opportunity to impress me and show everybody else why you should be playing.</p>
      <p>"The difficulty they have got at the moment is how well the team has been playing and performing. It has been really difficult for some of the lads to get in.</p>
      <p>“We could go right across the board with that but things do change."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: “Andre is in a position which a lot of the other lads who are not really featuring, are in. Who do you take out of the team to put him in?</p>
      <p>"At the moment Andre has got a problem with his big toe. He’s got arthritis which means he’d had a few injections in it, so at the moment he’s not currently fit. However, that’s only been for the last couple of weeks.”</p>
      <p>Green featured 22 times for Villa last season but after the permanent deals for Trezeguet, Anwar El Ghazi and Jota in the summer, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith</a> made him available for a loan move.</p>
