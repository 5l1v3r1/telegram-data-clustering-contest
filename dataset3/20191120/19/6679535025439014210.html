      <p>The State Cabinet has cleared proposals for a package of assistance for two companies, as part of the government’s efforts to promote industrial investment in the State.</p>
      <p>At its meeting on Tuesday, the Cabinet gave its nod to a proposal, concerning the Cheyyar SEZ Developers, for an additional investment of ₹175 crore. Cheyyar of Tiruvannamalai district is home to a footwear unit. Another proposal pertained to an investment of ₹350 crore by Sundaram Clayton for its unit in Hosur, Krishnagiri district, during 2015-18. Sources in the Industries Department clarified that the package, which should have been provided before the investment was made, was not granted to the firm due to a “communication gap”, which had since been set right.</p>
