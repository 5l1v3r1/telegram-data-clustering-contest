      <p>Devipriya R., a student of Government HSS for Girls, Nedumangad, is a loss for words.</p>
      <p>She did not fancy her chances of winning the Mohiniyattam event at the Thiruvananthapuram Revenue District School Arts Festival on Wednesday, but after bagging the first A grade she is set to head to the State-level event.</p>
      <p>In her previous appearance at the festival she had been placed third, so she is pleased as punch with her performance this time.</p>
      <p>Devipriya says she had her apprehensions, particularly since the performers before her had danced well, but in the end it all turned out well. Devipriya began dancing young, especially as her mother teaches dance, but it was at the suggestion of her school Principal that Devipriya began formal dance training. She at present trains under Karakulam Biju.</p>
      <p>She also performs Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam, and has taken part in the Bharatantyam event at the subdistrict arts festival.</p>
