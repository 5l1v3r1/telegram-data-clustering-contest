      <p>When you think of rapper A$AP Rocky, impeachment hearings <i>probably</i> don't come to mind. And yet, Rocky, real name Rakim Mayers, was a surprise focal point of testimony made by US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland during the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/impeachment-hearing-updates-sondland-cooper-hale-testimony-2019-11">impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump on Wednesday</a>. </p>
      <p>Sondland mentioned Rocky several times throughout his testimony, saying he and President Donald Trump had discussed the rapper during a July 26 phone call. </p>
      <p>Rocky spent a month in a Swedish jail after he was <a href="https://www.insider.com/us-rapper-aap-rocky-to-remain-in-swedish-custody-trump-plans-to-intervene-2019-7">detained in July over an altercation in Stockholm</a>. He was <a href="https://www.insider.com/aap-rocky-guilty-assault-swedish-court-2019-8">found guilty of assault on August 14</a>. He was released from custody on August 2 after <a href="https://www.insider.com/trump-officials-want-thank-you-from-asap-rocky-sweden-arrest-2019-8">President Donald Trump lobbied for his release</a>, and was not ordered to return.</p>
      <p>"It is true that the President speaks loudly at times. It is also true that we discussed <a href="http://www.insider.com/category/asap-rocky">A$AP Rocky</a>. It is true that the President likes to use colorful language," Sondland <a href="https://twitter.com/tictoc/status/1197169847584600064">said in his opening statement</a>.</p>
      <p>Later in the testimony, when Democratic counsel Daniel Goldman asked why he had not mentioned the July 26 call in his initial closed-door testimony.</p>
      <p>The phone call was mentioned by US diplomat David Holmes, who in a closed-door testimony on Saturday said he heard Sondland tell Trump that he should let Rocky "get sentenced, play the racism card, and give him a ticker-tape when he comes home."</p>
      <p>Sondland said he had later remember the call, thanks to the rapper being mentioned: "What triggered my memory was someone's reference to A$AP Rocky." He said the phone call mostly focused on Rocky being in jail, and not Ukraine military aid.</p>
      <p>Throughout the testimony, Rocky was mentioned at least three more times, mostly in reference to the phone call. </p>
      <p>Also during the testimony, Sondland confirmed Trump's <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gordon-sondland-confirm-quid-pro-quo-in-opening-statement-2019-11">quid-pro-quo arrangement</a> with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, and said Trump instructed him to work with his <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sondland-trump-ordered-me-work-rudy-giuliani-ukraine-impeachment-hearing-2019-11">personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani</a>, to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden.</p>
      <p>Business Insider has contacted Rocky, his agent, and record label for comment. </p>
