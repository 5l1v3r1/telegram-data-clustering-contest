      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:38:13+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:38</time> by <a rel="author">Vicki Newman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/vicki-newman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> shared a tragic story about the final days of Nicole Brown Simpson's life.</p>
      <p>Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman were brutally murdered on the doorstep of her home in June 1994.</p>
      <p>Her ex-husband OJ Simpson was arrested for the murders and taken to trial, where he was infamously acquitted.</p>
      <p>OJ always - and still does - protested his innocence, but he was later found legally responsible for the murders in a civil trial and ordered to pay millions to the families, although they still to this day haven't seen a penny.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> star Caitlyn's ex-wife Kris was best friends with Nicole for years, and before her transition from Bruce, she knew Nicole well.</p>

      <p>In her book, The Secrets Of My Life, Caitlyn revealed the haunting words Nicole said to her friend Faye Resnick just days before she was murdered.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn says that one night she was at home with Kris when Nicole called, concerned about Faye's drug use and adamant that they had to stage an intervention that night and get her into rehab by the morning.</p>
      <p>They met at Faye's house and tried to convince her to go to rehab, but it was Nicole's words that got through to her.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn writes: "Over and over, Nicole kept saying the same thing to Faye: 'If you don't stop, you're going to die. And you don't want your daughter to grow up without a mother.'</p>
      <p>"I was listening to the urgency and sincerity and love in Nicole's voice. She, more than anyone else in my mind, was the one who got her to rehab.</p>
      <p>"Three or maybe four days afterward, Nicole was dead.</p>

      <p>"Still to this day, I wish we had known that the person we needed to save in that room at that very moment was Nicole. As serious as Faye's situation was, Nicole's was even more life-threatening: It was her children who would grow up without a mother."</p>
