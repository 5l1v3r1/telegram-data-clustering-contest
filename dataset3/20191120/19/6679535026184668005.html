      <p>Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh on Wednesday urged officials to make the DTP and Tdap vaccination and Intensified Mission Indradhanush-2 in the district a success by disseminating adequate information.</p>
      <p>She was chairing a meeting on DTP and Tdap vaccination and Intensified Mission Indradhanush. She said meetings of parents should be convened at Anganwadi centres to create awareness to ensure all children are immunised.</p>
      <p>Ms. Rupesh said Indradhanush-2 would be taken up between this December and March 2020 while DTP and Tdap vaccination would be done between December 11 and 31. No child in the district should be deprived of vaccination, she said.</p>
      <p>The campaigns would be undertaken with the involvement of departments of primary and secondary education, health and family welfare, urban development, rural development and panchayat raj and non-governmental organisations.</p>
      <p>District Health Officer Ramakrishna Rao said DTP and Tdap vaccines are being administered to children between 6 and 16 years in view of diphtheria being found among children in the State. Anganwadi volunteers and health workers were asked to visit every household to create awareness.</p>
      <p>Dr. Rao said Indradhanush camps would be conducted during the first weeks from December to March with focus on children aged up to 2 and pregnant women who were not covered under it.</p>
      <p>DTP vaccine helps children aged up to 7 years (five doses in total) to develop immunity to diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (pertussis) while Tdap is a booster immunisation given at the age of 11 for continued protection from these diseases.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tuberculosis campaign</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Health and Family Welfare department would launch a campaign to eradicate tuberculosis in the district from November 25 to December 10. DHO Rao told reporters here on Wednesday that the campaign is a part of government mission to eradicate tuberculosis by 2025.</p>
      <p>As many 1,368 personnel in 684 teams will participate in the campaign to create awareness among people about tuberculosis. Those having continuous cough for more than two weeks, light fever during nights, pain in the chest, reduction in weight etc., should bring the same to the notice of visiting teams, Dr. Rao said.</p>
