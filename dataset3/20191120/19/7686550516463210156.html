      <p>A motorcyclist suffered serious injuries after a crash involving a car and a motorbike as Wales fans made their way back from last night's 2-0 win over Hungary.</p>
      <p>The accident happened on Cornwall Road, near Cardiff City Stadium at around 10.15pm last night, Tuesday November 11.</p>
      <p>The area was particularly busy at the time of the incident due to crowds leaving the ground.</p>
      <p>Police and paramedics attended the scene and a 25-year-old male motorcyclist was taken to the University Hospital of Wales with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Officer said that the motorcyclist was subsequently arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, taking a motor vehicle without consent and driving without insurance.</p>
      <p>An eyewitness at the scene said: "The driver was lying in the middle of the road with a number of people helping him.</p>
      <p>"There was substantial debris on the road and the motorbike was lying on its side.</p>
      <p>"Passers by, many who'd left the Wales game, were offering help and directing traffic including buses around the man.</p>
      <p>"We saw two ambulance response vehicles and an ambulance arrive."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: "Police are investigating a collision between a motorbike and car near the junction of Cornwall Street and North Clive Street, Grangetown, at around 10.15pm last night.</p>
      <p>"The motorcyclist was arrested for driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of excess alcohol, taking a motor vehicle without consent and driving without insurance.</p>
      <p>"The 25-year-old from Riverside was treated by paramedics at the scene and taken to the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, with serious injuries."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the incident is asked to contact South Wales Police on 101.</p>
