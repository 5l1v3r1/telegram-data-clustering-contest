      <p>Australian punk greats <b>Eddy Current Suppression Ring</b> went dark after 2009’s terrific <i><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/eddy-current-su/">Rush to Relax</a></i> (which didn’t get a US release till 2010), with Mikey Young off to start 23 other bands (<a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/total-control-p-2/">Total Control</a> among them) and a career as a very in-demand mastering engineer. A few singles were released this decade but, for the most part, nothing and if you’ve been wondering whether they’d ever make a record well, <i>All in Good Time</i>. That’s the title of their new album which is <a href="https://www.castlefacerecords.com/">out on Castle Face</a> on December 13! They’ve released a single from the album — the simmering “Our Quiet Whisper,” which like its title, goes for the low-key approach rather than hitting you over the head. “Out quiet whisper has become a chant,” sings Brendan Huntley, as a head full of steam bubbles just below the surface.</p>
      <p>Details are hazy but let’s hope they’re back for real, and then maybe they’ll tour? Stay tuned.</p>
