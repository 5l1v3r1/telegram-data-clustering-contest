        <b>Bayern Munich are keeping tabs on Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson as they think about a potential swoop for the Englishman, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/dean-henderson"><b>The 22-year-0ld</b></a>, who is on loan at Sheffield United this term, has impressed for Chris Wilder’s side having only let in nine goals in 12 Premier League games, with the Blades sitting 5th in the table.</p>
      <p>Henderson signed a new long-term deal at Old Trafford in June that will keep him at the club until 2023 at the latest, but according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7703739/Bayern-Munich-prepare-shock-Tottenham-striker-Troy-Parrott-eye-Dean-Henderson-swoop.html"><b>Daily Mail</b></a>, Bayern could be preparing to make a move for the goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>The report says that the German champions eye Henderson as the long-term successor to Manuel Neuer, 33, whose current contract expires in 2021.</p>
      <p>Neuer has made 354 appearances for Bayern since joining the club from Schalke, but he will be 35 when his deal reaches its conclusion and could look to move on to pastures new.</p>
      <p>Henderson, meanwhile, will not be available for the Blades this weekend for the clash with his parent club, who sit 10th in the table.</p>
      <p>Wilder’s men have impressed at home this season, taking runaway leaders <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/liverpool"><b>Liverpool</b></a> close to a draw while beating Arsenal 1-0.</p>
