      <p>The Nigerian Navy in Lagos on Wednesday handed over a suspect and an unregistered cocoa beverage factory to the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control.</p>
      <p>The Flag Officer Commanding, Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral Oladele Daji, handed over the suspect alongside the items to NAFDAC at Nigerian Navy Ship WEY in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Daji, who was represented by the Commander NNS WEY, Commodore Uduak Ibanga, said the suspect was caught producing unregistered cocoa beverage named Belling Chokovita.</p>
      <p>“The suspect was caught by NNS WEY security patrol team at 01:30hrs on Sunday November 17 in his factory at Mammy market, Navy Town, Ojo.</p>
      <p>“The following items recovered from the suspect’s illegal factory are 10 cartons x 12 pieces of finished products, 152 pieces of unpacked products.</p>
      <p>“Others are 23 bags of grounded cocoa powder and seven bags of Calcium Carbonate Power,” he said.</p>
      <p>Commodore Ibanga advised Nigerians to purchase only NAFDAC registered products and to always check the manufacturing or production and expiry dates of products before consumption.</p>
      <p>“The navy will not rest on her oars in carrying out this task and the cooperation of the general public is solicited,” he said.</p>
