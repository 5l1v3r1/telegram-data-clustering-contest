        <li>Valuation metrics in financials and real estate.</li>
        <li>Evolution since last month.</li>
        <li>A list of stocks looking cheap in their industries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This article series provides a monthly dashboard of industries in each sector of the GICS classification. It compares valuation and quality factors relative to their historical averages.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Executive summary</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Consumer finance and mortgage REITs look underpriced by 10% to 20% relative to valuation ratios historical averages. Capital markets look close to fair price. Real estate management has mixed metrics: it looks good in price/earnings, price/free cash flow and profitability, but the price/sales is bad. Commercial banks and thrifts/mortgage look good regarding the price/earnings ratio, but they are overpriced combining all valuation metrics. Insurance is the less attractive industry in finance.</p>
      <p>Since last month:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>P/E has deteriorated in capital markets, insurance, equity REITs, real estate management.</li>
        <li>P/S has improved in real estate management and deteriorated in banks, capital markets, thrifts/mortgage, consumer finance.</li>
        <li>P/FCF has improved in mortgage REITs, equity REITs and deteriorated in real estate management, banks, thrifts/mortgage, consumer finance.</li>
        <li>ROE has improved in consumer finance and deteriorated in capital markets.</li>
        <li>The real estate Select Sector SPDR ETF (<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLRE">XLRE</a>) has lagged the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF by 6.7% and the financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLF">XLF</a>) has outperformed it by 0.9%.</li>
        <li>The 5 top momentum stocks on this period in the S&amp;P 500 financial and real estate sectors are: InterGroup Corp. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTG">INTG</a>), Liberty Property Trust (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LPT">LPT</a>), Newmark Group Inc.

      <p>The stocks listed below are in the S&amp;P 1500 index, cheaper than their respective industry factor for price/earnings, price/sales and price/free cash flow. The 10 companies with the highest return on equity are kept in the final selection. <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/account/research/subscribe?slug=fred-piard&amp;source=auths_effs_fred-piard">Quantitative Risk &amp; Value Members</a> have an early access to the stock lists before they are published in free-access articles.

      <p>I take 4 aggregate industry factors: price/earnings (P/E), price to sales (P/S), price to free cash flow (P/FCF), return on equity (ROE). My choice has been justified <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3490166-value-investors-the-best-valuation-ratio-may-not-be-what-you-think">here</a> and <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/3510286-value-investors-the-best-ratios-may-not-be-what-you-think-part-2">here</a>. Their calculation aims at limiting the influence of outliers and large caps. They are reference values for stock picking, not for capital-weighted indices.</p>
      <p>For each factor I calculate the difference with its own historical average: to the average for valuation ratios, from the average for ROE, so that the higher is always the better. The difference is measured in percentage for valuation ratios, not for ROE (already in percentage).</p>
      <p>The next table reports the 4 industry factors. There are 3 columns for each factor: the current value, the average (“Avg”) between January 1999 and October 2015 taken as an arbitrary reference of fair valuation, and the difference explained above (“D-xxx”).</p>

      <p>The following charts give an idea of the current status of 3 valuation factors (P/E, P/S, P/FCF) and a quality factor (ROE) relative to their historical average in each industry. For all factors the difference to average is calculated in the direction where positive is good. For valuation ratios lower is better, for ROE higher is better. On the charts below higher is always better.</p>

      <p>Most of my stock holdings are based on quantitative value models. However, value is a bad timing indicator. Quantitative Risk &amp; Value (QRV) provides you with a more realistic quantitative approach, for a world of probabilities instead of just risk on/risk off. It includes a systemic risk indicator and strategies based on it. <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/checkout?service_id=mp_66"><b>Get started</b></a> with a two-week free trial and see how QRV can improve your investing decisions.</p>
