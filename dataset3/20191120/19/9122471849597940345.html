      <h1>Viral Clip Shows What LeBron Told Referee On Tuesday Night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:48:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>A clip of LeBron James talking to a referee during Tuesday night’s Los Angeles Lakers-Oklahoma City Thunder game has gone viral on social media.</p>
      <p>The clip shows LeBron talking to the referee and telling him to ignore any stories he’s ready about the star’s demise on defense.</p>
      <p>LeBron didn’t seem to be happy with a call from the referee. He wanted to remind him that he’s actually playing good defense this year.</p>
      <p>“I know you’ve been reading and saying I haven’t been playing defense the last couple of years, but it’s a new year!” James tells the ref.</p>

      <p>James actually has been playing good defense this year, too.</p>
      <p>The Lakers star’s defensive rating has gone from 107.6 in 2018-19 to 96.4 this season. It’s still early, and that rating will likely go up as the year goes on, but still.</p>
      <p>LeBron is right – it’s a new season and both he and the Lakers are playing at an incredibly high level on both ends of the court.</p>
