      <p>Earlier in the day, a girl identified as a Babcock University student and an unidentified male were seen in what appeared to be a leaked sex tape.</p>
      <p>The video went viral almost immediately with many displeased at the act. As it became a trending topic on Twitter, the story began taking different twists and turns.</p>
      <p>Some Twitter NG users claim the sex tape was leaked as an act of revenge against the girl, while others think it was solely the boy’s doing. While the comparisons went on, others awaited the response of the school authorities.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Babcock_Univ/status/1197190546114129920">Babcock University, through its Twitter page</a>, released an official statement as shown below and in it are the 4 things we have learned about the case:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The boy in the video was expelled in February 2019 for being involved in “certain grievous misconducts” for which the university does not tolerate.</li>
        <li>“His girlfriend”, until the video was released, was a 300-level student of Accounting.</li>
        <li>She has been expelled from the institution for “the violation of university rules and regulations”</li>
        <li>The incident took place in April while the school was on vacation</li>
        <li>The incident did not take place in school but at Saint Bridget’s Hospital, Ogun state, while she visited the boy undergoing rehabilitation.</li>
      </ol>
