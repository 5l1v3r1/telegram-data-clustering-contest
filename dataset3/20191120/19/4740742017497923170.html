      <h1>Fears for Ammi, a puppy who ran off after being hit by a taxi</h1>
      <h2>He hasn't been seen for 18 hours and counting</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:11:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:11</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>A woman has launched a massive search for a missing puppy, after it was hit by a taxi in Bristol and ran off.</p>
      <p>Ammi, a nine-month-old male Staffordshire cross, has not been seen since he ran into the darkness after being hit by a taxi while crossing the road in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-george">St George.</a></p>
      <p>The brindle-coloured male was being walked on a lead by his owner Toni Teale across Church Road at around 1.30am in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Police confirmed they attended the scene, and are reviewing dashcam footage of the incident.</p>
      <p>Toni said she has been left devastated by Ammi’s disappearance, and appealed to everyone in Bristol to look out for him.</p>
      <p>A major search has been carried out in St George’s Park, but so far - at 6pm on Wednesday, November 20, and with Ammi missing for almost 17 hours - he has not turned up yet.</p>

      <p>Fears are growing for the puppy, with the incident happening so quickly that no one was able to ascertain how badly he was injured.</p>
      <p>He was last seen wearing a reflective harness with a red lead attached.</p>
      <p>“We were crossing the road when the car came speeding up and hit my dog,” said Toni.</p>
      <p>“Ammi hasn’t been seen by anyone yet - dog wardens and local vets have been contacted, and I’m just praying he’s ok,” she added.</p>
      <p>“Devastated is not the word - I don’t know if he’s ok or not, but I’ve been looking for him ever since and still haven’t found him,” she said.</p>

      <p>“If anyone has him or knows anyone who has, please take him to the local vets so he can come home,” she added.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">Avon and Somerset police</a>e confirmed that they were called to an incident at around 1.30am on Church Road. He said officers were reviewing dashcam footage to ascertain whether any offences had been committed.</p>
