      <p>You’ll start<i> </i><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-sword-shield/40501"><i>Pokémon</i> <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a> with two toys: a feather dangler and a Poké Ball toy. Pokémon can play with these at camp, whether it’s punching the dangler or chasing the ball. But there’s another way to get toys, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-sword-shield-guide/2019/11/15/20967068/pokemon-sword-and-shield-guide-how-to-cook-curry-full-recipe-list-and-rankings">that’s by making curries</a>.</p>
      <p>Filling up your Curry Dex has its own benefits, of course — they heal your Pokémon and make them happy. But if you visit the Camping King in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-sword-shield-guide/2019/11/15/20953310/wild-area-tips-tricks">Wild Area</a>’s East Lake Axewell, just south of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-sword-shield-guide/2019/11/15/20961540/motostoke-gym-challenge-kabu-fire-type-battle-guide-tips-strategy">Motostoke</a> stairs. The Camping King can change the color of your tent, but he’ll also rate your Curry Dex, and reward you when you reach certain milestones.</p>

      <p>If you’re looking at the stairs, he’s to the left. Interact with him to pull up a menu and Select “Rate my Curry Dex, please.” He’ll take a quick look at your ‘dex and reward you for the number of curries you’ve made so far.</p>
      <p>These are the toys available — we’ve confirmed up to 50 curries:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fresh Ball — 5 curries</li>
        <li>Weighted Ball — 10 curries</li>
        <li>Soothe Ball — 15 curries</li>
        <li>Mirror Ball — 30 curries</li>
        <li>Tympole Ball — 50 curries</li>
        <li>Champion Ball — 151 curries, <a href="https://www.serebii.net/swordshield/pokemoncamp.shtml">according to Serebii</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The biggest difference between these toys is how you throw them and how they move — the weighted ball is heavy, the soothe ball jingles and is quite light, and the Tympole ball has a squeaker that sounds like Tympole’s cry.</p>
      <p>Playing with your Pokémon increases their experience but it always makes them like you more, which can impact battles. For instance, a Pokémon that wants to please you might withstand a critical hit.</p>
