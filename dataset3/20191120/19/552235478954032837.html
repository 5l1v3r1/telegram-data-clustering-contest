      <p>The charges relate to Haines allegedly causing a disturbance on the flight to Dalaman in Turkey, which forced the pilot to return to Stansted.</p>
      <p>Two <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/royal-air-force">RAF fighter</a> jets were scrambled to meet the plane and escort it back to Stansted, where Haines was arrested by Essex Police upon landing.</p>
      <p>On board the flight, a cabin crew member allegedly suffered scratches as she tried to prevent Haines from opening the plane door.</p>

      <p>In court, Haines, of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, with her hair worn up and wearing a black top, spoke only to confirm her name, date of birth, address and British nationality.</p>
      <p>She did not enter pleas during the 10-minute hearing.</p>
      <p>District Judge Timothy King granted Haines conditional bail on the grounds that she does not travel from any UK airport.</p>
      <p>He sent her case to Chelmsford Crown Court, where she is due to appear on December 18.</p>
