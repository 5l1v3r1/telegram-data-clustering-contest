      <h1>Flood of complaints received under ‘Friendly Bus’ programme</h1>
      <h2>Initiative was launched by district administration for finding solution to row between students, private bus crew</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:31:56+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-P-Praveen-536/" target="_blank">M.P. Praveen</a></address>
      <p>In less than four months since its launch, Friendly Bus, a WhatsApp-driven complaint redressal mechanism launched by the district administration for finding a solution to the row between students and private bus workers in the district, has received 156 complaints.</p>
      <p>The recent incident in which a Plus Two student was injured after being allegedly shoved out from entering a private bus at Thrikkakara, however, was yet another proof that the festering row is far from over.</p>
      <p>The complaint that the girl was shoved out to deny her entry into the bus was in keeping with the pattern of complaints received through the Friendly Bus programme, which was launched on July 26.</p>
      <p>“The majority of the complaints received under the programme fell into three broad categories – denial of concession, rude behaviour of the bus crew, and not stopping the bus at the designated stop to deny students entry,” said K. Manoj Kumar, Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer (RTO).</p>
      <p>The WhatsApp group has representatives of associations of bus owners and workers, Motor Vehicle Department (MVD), police and the district administration.</p>
      <p>“We have been prompt in taking up the complaints with the owner of the bus concerned and sending out a stern message to the workers implicated. Punitive action was proposed only if a complaint was registered against the guilty party a second time, which hasn’t happened yet. Initially, complaints were reported thick and fast though it slowed down gradually,” said Mr. Kumar. However, in the instant case, the matter was not reported under the programme but was lodged directly with the District Collector.</p>
      <p>M.B. Sathyan, president of the Kerala Private Bus Operators Federation, however, said that the veracity of the complaint that the student was shoved out needed to be verified.</p>
      <p>The student may have stopped from entering the bus owing to overcrowding of students and was very unlikely to have been pushed out, he said. “I have been raising this issue repeatedly that there needs to be some mechanism whereby students don’t jampack into one bus. A few National Service Scheme or NCC volunteers should be deployed so that a limited number of students board each bus rather than everyone crowing into the first bus coming their way,” Mr. Sathyan said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the MVD has issued a show cause notice to the owner of the bus operating on the Ernakulam-Pookkattupady route. The conductor appeared before the MVD on Tuesday and it was found that he didn’t have the requisite licence.</p>
      <p>The Thrikkakara police had seized the bus and arrested the driver and the conductor under IPC Sections 325 (causing grievous hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). They were, however, released on bail.</p>
      <p>The WhatsApp number for reporting complaints about private buses is: 8281998933.</p>
