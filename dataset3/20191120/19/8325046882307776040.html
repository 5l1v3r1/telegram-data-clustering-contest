      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a> allows you to transfer money between more than 200 countries and 25 currencies, and may also give you the ability to reload a cell phone for someone abroad. But it isn’t a free service, and there are fees associated with these kinds of transfers.</p>
      <p>The transfer fee is 5% of the transfer amount, with a minimum charge of 99 cents and a maximum of $4.99 if you’re transferring from your bank account or <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/paypal">PayPal</a> balance.</p>
      <p>If you’re using a debit or credit card to transfer money, there is no fee limit, and you’ll have to pay an additional 2.9% funding fee, plus a fixed fee that <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees#fixed-fees">depends on the country you’re sending money to</a>.</p>
