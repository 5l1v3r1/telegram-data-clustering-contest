      <p>A young Derby dad who was diagnosed with bowel cancer says the hardest thing about the illness is being too weak to play with his kids.</p>
      <p>In August, Adam Cattermole, 36, discovered he had a rare, aggressive form of bowel cancer after going to A&amp;E with stomach pains.</p>
      <p>Doctors found a tumour in his bowel but were reluctant to estimate how long he had left to live because statistics are based on older patients.</p>
      <p>Since then, Mr Cattermole's family have been <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/adam-cattermole-3276668">fundraising to pay for a live-saving treatment</a> called Avastin, which isn't available on the NHS.</p>
      <p>Mr Cattermole also applied to be a part of an Avastin medical trial but was sadly unable to participate due to having a weak liver condition.</p>
      <p>That was a couple of weeks ago and the dad-of-three, from Littleover, has now started on his third cycle of chemotherapy.</p>

      <p>He said: "Physically, I'm feeling a lot better than I usually do after chemo.</p>
      <p>"My liver function has improved so they have upped the dosage of one of my drugs to 100% which is good news.</p>
      <p>"Most of the time it's the fatigue that gets me but I'm seeing a physiotherapist now so that should reduce."</p>
      <p>Mentally, however, Mr Cattermole said he wasn't feeling as good and has been suffering with depression and anxiety.</p>
      <p>The young man said that everything he has had to deal with was "getting on top" of him.</p>
      <p>Mr Cattermole added it's "heartbreaking" when he can't play games with his children - Harry, six, Jacob, four, and 18-month-old Rosie.</p>
      <p>"It's quite hard with three kids because when friends and family come round, they are making them laugh and messing about with them," he said.</p>
      <p>"It's something that I can't physically do because I don't have the strength and I don't want to damage myself."</p>
      <p>But, he said the kids understand that they need to be careful with him, especially after a visit to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Mr Cattermole said: "We have told the kids as much as we know, that I have cancer and that I'm on drugs, but I don't know any prognosis."</p>

      <p>Mr Cattermole said he doesn't want to know how long he has left to live because it would cause too much stress.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to have that extra thing in my head, every time the time comes around to be expecting the end," he said.</p>
      <p>To raise money for Mr Cattermole's treatment, there will be a festival at Bustler's Market on November 22 and November 23.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2275409069385538/">Mole Knows Fest</a> is a two-day event filled with live music, craft and food stalls, a children's rave and a charity auction.</p>
      <p>Starting at 5pm on Friday the programme will continue until late on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Mr Cattermole said Bustler's have kindly offered the venue for free and said he "couldn't thank Derby enough" for the support he has received.</p>
      <p>But most of all, he said it was his wife Emma that he couldn't do without.</p>
      <p>"She's just always there when I need her, even if it's just making a cup of tea.</p>
      <p>"If there was a prize for best carer, Emma would be up there," he said.</p>
