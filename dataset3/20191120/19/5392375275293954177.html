      <p>Galaxy S10 Lite camera’s specifications leaked yet again; Galaxy S11 5G codename is “Y2”<br/>3.3 (66.67%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>Samsung is expected to launch another Galaxy S10 device before the end of 2019. The new device will come under the Galaxy S10 Lite moniker but don’t let the “Lite” on its name confuse you. The device will carry the Snapdragon 855, the same flagship SoC, that is inside the other S10 handsets. While the device’s launch is unknown, details about the cameras have been leaked.</p>
      <p>The leak was posted yesterday on Twitter as a courtesy of Ishan Agarwal (<a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1196753599734243328">@Ishanagarwal24</a>). According to him, the Galaxy S10 Lite will feature a 48MP main sensor that comes paired with a 12MP ultrawide angle camera and a 5MP depth sensor. This camera is most likely the ISOCELL GM2 that was announced back in May of this year. According to the leak, the device will carry the SM-G770F serial.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, the leak states that the device will ship with a 32MP selfie snapper. That’s exactly the same sensor that debuted with the Galaxy A50s. While the camera specifications have already popped out earlier this month, Ishan states that he confirmed the details. That said, we don’t expect to see the S10 Lite beating its sibling in terms of camera performance. However, with this configuration, it should capture better than average shots.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S10 Lite should come with a 6.7-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED screen, 8GB of RAM and run Android 10-based One UI 2 straight out of the box. Also, the device draws power from a 4,370mAh battery which is larger than the other Galaxy S10 smartphones. We are curious to see for what the “Lite” moniker will stand for, hopefully, the price.</p>

      <p>Ishan also finished his post stating that he discovered the internal codename of the Galaxy S11 5G. The device carries the model number SM-G986U and is internally called <b>Y2</b>.</p>
