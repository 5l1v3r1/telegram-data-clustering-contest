      <h1>The British solution to beat flooding: Bring back beavers</h1>

      <p>Beavers are to be reintroduced in two parts of Britain as part of plans to help control flooding, the National Trust announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The charity, which manages historic properties and countryside, said it aimed to release Eurasian beavers at two sites in southern England early next year.</p>
      <p>"The dams the beavers create will hold water in dry periods, help to lessen flash-flooding downstream and reduce erosion and improve water quality by holding silt," said Ben Eardley, project manager at one of the sites.</p>
      <p>Beavers were hunted out of existence in Britain in the 16th century because of demand for their fur, meat and scent glands.</p>
      <p>There have since been several controlled reintroductions of the mammals, including in western Scotland.</p>
      <p>Beavers have been described as "nature's engineers", whose work can help create wetland habitats to support a range of species from insects to wildfowl.</p>
      <p>Beavers in river catchment areas would "help make our landscape more resilient to climate change and the extremes of weather it will bring", Eardley said.</p>
      <p>He will oversee the reintroduction of one pair of beavers at Holnicote, near Exmoor National Park in southwest England.</p>
      <p>Another pair will be released on the Black Down Estate, on the edge of the South Downs on the English south coast.</p>
      <p>They will all be introduced in fenced-off woodland areas. Experts will then monitor changes to the habitat that result.</p>
      <p>The National Trust is aiming to restore 25,000 hectares (62,000 acres) of "wildlife-rich habitats" by 2025, amid concern at a decline in species since 1970.</p>
      <p>Parts of northern England have been hit by severe flooding in recent weeks, with some areas having their wettest autumn on record, according to the Met Office weather agency.</p>
      <p>Eighteen flood warnings were in place on Wednesday morning, with 58 further alerts notifying possible flooding, the Environment Agency said.</p>
      <p>As well as prolonged heavy rainfall, building on flood plains, poor flood defences and maintenance of watercourses are among the contributory factors.</p>
