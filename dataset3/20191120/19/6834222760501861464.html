      <h1>MotoGP, Iannone: "My outburst after the fire? I was scared and angry"</h1>
      <h2>"We took a risk, but you sometimes have to do that to improve. The engine was running in extreme conditions, and we understood some important things"</h2>

      <p>The garage should be a protected zone, but in reality it's hard to avoid the cameras, which were on hand today to record <a href="http://www.gpone.com/it/2019/11/20/motogp/iannone-furioso-siete-matti-mi-ammazzo-nel-muro-a-300-allora.html">Andrea Iannone's outburst</a> as it happened. His Aprilia caught fire along the straight: “<i>I'm risking my life like this"</i> he said. An understandable reaction and the Italian was back to talk about it again at the end of the day, emotions running less high.</p>
      <p>“<i><b>Ir was a dangerous situation and it's normal to be scared </b></i>- he explains - <i>Especially because it happened down the straight. The bike caught fire, I could feel a lot of heat on my feet and there was oil on the brake lever. It's normal to get angry in certain situations</i>”.</p>
      <p>Aprilia needs to carry out tests if it wants to improve and today's attempts didn't work out, but the team were nevertheless able to understand certain things. Andrea clarifies.</p>
      <p>“<i>We understood that our rivals are using a shorter gear ratio than us and so the engine runs at higher revs for longer</i> - he says - <i>We tried it, aware it was a risk. Our engine isn't used to running so high for so long, but we wanted to try something extreme</i>”.</p>
      <p>Everyone saw what happened, but Iannone defends the decision.</p>
      <p>“<i>It's important to test different situations. We know we need a few extra horsepower and we know we have to improve. Yesterday we identified some very interesting things and</i><i> <b>Romano Albesiano is very brave in this regard. Maybe we shouldn't have risked today, but if you want to improve, you have to do that sometimes. We found something good in the end</b></i><b>”</b>.</p>
      <p>They are working on the 2020 RS-GP in Noale, but it's important to collate data to define the new project.</p>
      <p>“<i>The positive is that we've continued to work to improve. We didn't give up and used all our energies to look ahead. We'll have some new parts at Jerez and will also re-test solutions used this season. <b>We're waiting for the new bike that should arrive for the Sepang tests</b></i><b>”.</b></p>
