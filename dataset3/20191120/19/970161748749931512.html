      <p>Damaged teenager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) has behaved appallingly in Emmerdale as Maya Stepney’s (Louisa Clein) hold over him continues to twist him. As he pined for her following his release, he ended up using Leanna Cavanagh (Mimi Slinger) to try and distract himself.</p>
      <p>As he continued to wait for contact from Maya, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">who yesterday came out of prison sporting a pregnant stomach</a>, Leanna wanted to know why he was being so off with her. They ended up spending the day together and as leanna got up to leave due to Jacob’s dismissive nature, he assured her that he liked her and he was lucky to be with her.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-jacob-maya-pregnant-age-leanna-return-11187552/">They started kissing and one thing led to another</a> but Jacob was awkward afterwards and got dressed before heading to leave. A hurt Leanna asked why he was going and if she had done something wrong and Jacob was guilty to realise that it had been her first time. As he walked out, Leanna felt horrible about herself.</p>

      <p>Back home, all Jacob could focus on was Maya as he pored over a picture of her while also checking his phone for any contact. It’s clear that he is unable to get her out of his head after her toxic grooming of him – and this has now been at the expense of Leanna.</p>
      <p>Later, Leanna was disgusted when she got a blunt text from Jacob asking if she was on the pill and she realised the truth of the situation. Regretting their encounter, she will open up to her dad (Jonny MacPherson), who will be livid with Jacob and attack him, accusing him of putting pressure on his daughter to have sex before she is ready.</p>
      <p>Will Jacob realise the cruelty of his actions – and will it give him a wake up call over what Maya’s abuse has made him become?</p>
