        <b>A cat who went missing back in 2014 has been reunited with his owner - more than 1,200 miles away.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The six-year-old cat named Sasha was found on the streets of Santa Fe in the US state of New Mexico.</p>
      <p>His owner Viktor Usov lives in Portland, Oregon - three states away.</p>
      <p>The journey would take around 20 days on foot.</p>
      <p>The Santa Fe Animal Shelter said it has no idea how or why the cat ended up so far from home.</p>
      <p>But as he was microchiped, they were able to locate his owner.</p>

      <p>Murad Kirdar is public information officer at the Santa Fe Animal Shelter.</p>
      <p>He explained: "Sasha came up to us as a stray wondering the streets of Santa Fe.</p>
      <p>"Animal control brought him in and he had no collar - but when we scanned the cat low and behold there was a phone number on it.</p>
      <p>"We called the number and it was a family in Portland, Oregon".</p>
      <p>Asked what he thought Sasha was doing for the last five years, Mr Usov said: "I imagine he got to see the Grand Canyon".</p>

      <p>The cat and Mr Kirdar were flown back to Oregon by American Airlines.</p>
      <p>Company spokesman Curtis Blessing said: "At American Airlines, our business is about caring for people on life's journey and connecting them with their loved ones.</p>
      <p>"When we heard Sasha had been found so far from home, we were honoured to be in a position to get her back to her family."</p>
