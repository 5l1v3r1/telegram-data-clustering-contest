      <p>Senior Congress leader V.M. Sudheeran on Wednesday offered his support to the ongoing indefinite fast being staged by the employees of the now-defunct Comtrust Weaving Factory, outside the Kerala State Industrial Development Corporation office in Thiruvananthapuram.</p>
      <p>The agitation entered the 30th day on November 30. Mr. Sudheeran said that it was the responsibility of the government to implement the provisions of the bill passed by the Legislative Assembly and there need not be a strike for the purpose. Both the Left Democratic Front and the United Democratic Front were in support of the bill. “Even then, if there are difficulties to implement it, the Chief Minister should intervene,” Mr. Sudheeran said.</p>
