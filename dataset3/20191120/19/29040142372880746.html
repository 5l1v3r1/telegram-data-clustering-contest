      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Yes, the Galaxy S10's under-screen fingerprint sensor should work with any plastic screen protector (occasionally <i>too</i> well...), but if you want to use a tempered glass protector, you should aim to buy one that's certified by Samsung or verified to work with in-display fingerprint scanners.</p>

      <h3>Tips on a great tempered glass screen protector</h3>

      <p>The Samsung Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ both have a fingerprint sensor sitting beneath the display that allows you to unlock your phone by placing your thumb on the lower portion of the screen. This is a convenience over having to reach around the back where Samsung had previously placed its fingerprint sensor over the past couple of years. As cool as this new biometric unlocking system is, it can also cause issues if you use certain screen protectors.</p>
      <blockquote>You shouldn't use any old screen protector for the Galaxy S10.</blockquote>
      <p>The exact technology in play is Qualcomm's ultrasonic fingerprint reader, which uses sound pressure waves to read the 3D surface area of your finger, giving you a more technologically convenient <i>and</i> secure biometric security option than the previous scanner. However, those sound waves can cause some big problems when it comes to tempered glass screen protectors because if there are any gaps between your screen protector and your display, the ultrasonic waves can't get an accurate reading. Although your regular tempered glass screen protector <i>appears</i> to be in direct contact with the display, the adhesive used to keep it all together creates a very thin gap that is just thin enough to throw off the Galaxy S10's ultrasonic scanner.</p>
      <p>This issue, it would seem, has been addressed by most makers of tempered glass screen accessories, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R8P3Y49?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU72713YYw">Clearview Liquid Glass</a> that uses similar technology as found with our previous top recommendation, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dome-Glass-Ultrasonic-Fingerprint-Whitestone/dp/B07NQ2MBSW/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU72713YYw">Whitestone Dome Glass</a>, except Clearview's offering has better user reviews and a friendlier price.</p>
      <p>Just when it seemed everything was sorted out, a <i>new</i> flaw involving screen protectors and the fingerprint sensor was uncovered in October when it was reported that some third-party silicone-based screen protectors made it possible for the fingerprint sensor to be <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-will-soon-fix-galaxy-s10-flaw-allows-any-fingerprint-unlock-phone">unlocked by fingerprints not registered to the device</a>. Samsung said they would address the issue with a software update and once again reiterated that people only use Samsung-approved accessories. Of course, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-7293382-12001245-1428599469000%3Fsid%3DUUacUdUnU72713YYw%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fmobile%252Fmobile-accessories%252Fphones%252Fgalaxy-s10-screen-protector-transparent-et-fg973ctegus%252F&amp;token=Z-GPa8-9">screen protectors</a> that they feature up on their own website don't appear to be available for purchase anywhere online. So that's just <i>great</i>.</p>
      <p>Given all that news, it just might be a safer bet to go with the admittedly pricier tempered glass from Clearview or Whitestone since it will provide superior protection and is also not be affected from the false positive issue you may run into using cheaper third-party film accessories. There are other nice reasons to go with these UV-adhered screen protectors. We like its installation kit, as it makes it laughably easy to install the screen protector without developing air bubbles. That liquid adhesive it uses can also supposedly fix minor scratches and cracks as it settles into the crevices. That gives it added value for those who maybe waited a bit too long to protect their phone.</p>
      <h3>You've still got options beyond tempered glass for your Galaxy S10</h3>

      <p>But let's say you really don't want to shell out for a tempered glass screen protector. Assuming that Samsung has sorted the issue with the film screen protectors (<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-now-rolling-out-fix-fingerprint-issues-s10-and-note-10-south-korea">a fix was offered for Korean devices</a> and was expected rolled out to other countries later) those still also viable options for protecting your phone's screen without affecting the usefulness of the fingerprint scanner.</p>
      <p>We've got a roundup of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-galaxy-s10-screen-protectors">best screen protectors for the Galaxy S10</a> that includes both tempered glass and film, so you shouldn't be scared off of going with the screen protector that's right for you and your budget. Our top pick for film screen protectors is this 3-pack of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07LGS5K5R?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU72713YYw">LK HD Screen Protectors</a> which is the best value for protecting your phone's screen as long as you take the time during the installation process.</p>

      <p>A premium device inside and out.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S10 is an absolute powerhouse that's deserving of your time and money. From its stunning AMOLED display, in-screen fingerprint sensor, and three rear cameras, the S10 has something for everyone.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>A class of its own.</p>
      <p>The Clearview Liquid Glass is one of the best tempered glass screen protectors tha'ts verified to work correctly and reliably with the Samsung Galaxy S10's fingerprint sensor. It's a bit costly, but worth it for the peace of mind it provides.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>The best of both worlds.</p>
      <p>If a tempered glass option is too pricey for you, there's no shame in opting for a plastic screen protector. It'll still offer some level of protection, and if it does accrue scratches over time you have two more ready to go.</p>
