      <p>Mercedes-AMG has officially unveiled its flagship high-performance SUV at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. Meet the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/amg-gls-63">2021 Mercedes-AMG GLS 63</a>, a 600+ horsepower full-size SUV packed with loads of technology and luxury. Let's start with its crown jewel: under its hood lies a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 with 603 hp and 627 lb-ft of torque. The SUV comes equipped with an integrated EQ Boost starter-generator that unites a starter motor and an alternator into a single electric motor located between the engine and transmission. It also provides an additional 21 hp and 184 lb-ft of torque and also performs hybrid functions such as boost, recuperation, gliding, and the start/stop engine function.</p>
      <p>The result is fuel savings not previously found in a 48-volt electrical system. Mercedes-AMG claims the SUV will sprint from 0 to 60 mph in 4.1 seconds and top speed is electronically limited to 174 mph. A nine-speed automatic transmission sends power to the 4Matic all-wheel-drive system.</p>

      <p>To help manage all of this power, the AMG GLS 63 is equipped with standard AMG Ride Control, which is comprised of an air suspension with a unique spring and damper setup and the Adaptive Damping System. A total of six driving modes are on offer: Comfort, Sport, Sport +, Individual, Trail, and Sand. All modes are linked to the AMG Dynamics agility control system, meaning the handling characteristics are closely matched with different requirements and driving conditions.</p>
      <p>A high-performance braking system consists of ventilated and perforated brake discs with 6-piston fixed calipers painted in grey and white (with AMG lettering, of course) up front, with internally ventilated brake discs with a 1-piston floating caliper at the back.</p>

      <p>To distinguish the AMG GLS 63 from the standard GLS, it's been equipped with an AMG-specific radiator grille – the largest grille found on any AMG model – with vertical slats in high-gloss chrome. The hood is also unique while Dynamic LED headlamps with adaptive high beam assist are standard. An AMG front bumper with an integrated jetwing design, front splitter, jetwing trim strip in silver, and side air inlets are also present. Notice the must-have flared wheel arches, side skirts, and window surrounds in high-gloss chrome trim.</p>
      <p>Out back, the AMG rear bumper, diffuser, and two rectangular twin tailpipes are to be found. A set of 21-inch AMG multispoke wheels are standard, but buyers can select up to 23-inch wheel variants.</p>

      <p>Step inside and you'll be indulged with more AMG-specific flare, such as brushed stainless steel sports pedals, illuminated door sill panels, and 64-color configurable ambient lighting. The cockpit is adorned with a three-spoke AMG steering wheel, high-resolution 12.3-inch driver's gauge display and a 12.3-inch touchscreen, both incorporated under a single glass cover. Drivers can select from four display styles: Modern Classic, Sport, Discreet, and the AMG-specific Supersport. AMG badging can be found throughout the three-row cabin. There's even heated seats for third-row occupants.</p>
      <p>A number of standard safety systems include Evasive Steering Assist, Active Blind Spot Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Pre-Safe Impulse Side, which actually moves the driver or front passenger up to 2.75-inches away from the impact zone by rapidly inflating the seat's side bolster.</p>
      <p>Mercedes-AMG has not announced an on-sale date, fuel economy figures, or pricing.</p>
