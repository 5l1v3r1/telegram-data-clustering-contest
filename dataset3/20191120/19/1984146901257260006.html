      <p>Shoppers at Tesco will be able to save on every litre of fuel they buy this month with the supermarket's new petrol promotion.</p>
      <p>Customers can now get 10p off every litre they top up when they spend £60 in stores until December 1.</p>
      <p>The discount means anyone planning a big spend at Tesco will be able to cash in on reduced petrol and diesel.</p>
      <p>It gives you a reduction on your next top up when you spend the minimum amount in a single shop at Tesco, either in-store or online - which can then be redeemed at your local fuel station.</p>
      <p>If you shop in-store, your receipt will automatically include a money-off fuel coupon when you spend £60.</p>
      <p>Those who shop online will instead get a money-off fuel coupon when their shopping is delivered, or when they collect their items in store.</p>
      <p>The coupons can be redeemed at any UK Tesco fuel station kiosk - but won't include Express stores selling Esso fuel, Pay at Pump, unmanned petrol filling stations or in Isle of Man and Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The deal also excludes its Kirkwall and Lerwick Superstores.</p>
      <p>It also won’t apply to anything you buy at any café, tobacco kiosk, opticians, phone store, concessions, travel money or Tesco Bank as well as fuel, lottery products, gift cards, e-top ups, savings stamps, postage stamps, 10p carrier bags, prescription medicines and infant milk formulae you buy.</p>
      <p>Once you've made the spend, you'll be given two weeks to redeem the coupon - or until December 15 for online vouchers.</p>
      <p>The discount can be used to fill up on unleaded petrol, super unleaded petrol, diesel or LPG up to a maximum of 100 litres.</p>
      <h3>Save on petrol and diesel all year round</h3>

        <li><b>Choose wisely -</b>  These stations buy more fuel and can take advantage of falling prices. “The big petrol stations have deliveries every day so they can change the price,” Arthur Renshaw, of petrol station analyst Catalist Experian, told <i>The Mirror</i> . “But a small petrol station in a village may have a delivery every couple of weeks.”</li>
        <li><b>Go big -</b>  Stations buy their fuel on the wholesale market. Just as in any other negotiation, the big buyers are better able to strike a deal.</li>
        <li><b>Find competition -</b>  When several stations are close together, they are more likely to cut prices to tempt drivers in. “If you are in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, you have much less competition than in the centre of Manchester,” said Renshaw.</li>
        <li><b>Compare prices ahead of time -</b>  The website  <a href="http://www.petrolprices.com/">PetrolPrices.com</a>  allows you to compare prices in your area. It also lists the latest average prices, so you know if you’re being ripped off.</li>
        <li><b>Try your supermarket -</b>  Supermarkets are competing on fuel prices along with everything else. When you’re shopping, keep an eye out for vouchers offering petrol discounts. But be aware of the overall cost. “That is one way to get prices down below £1, but you do need to buy a lot of food to get that result,” PetrolPrices.com owner Peter Zaborszky said.</li>
        <li><b>Follow cheap rent -</b>  Airports, motorways, expensive cities and rural areas have the highest charges, according to PetrolPrices.com analysis. “The golden path is down the middle where rent is cheap,” Zaborszky explained.</li>
