      <p>The Central government seems to be in no mood to listen to the saner voices of reason as it rides roughshod over the aspirations of people of Jammu and Kashmir — of their desire to be governed democratically, and in an open and free manner (Editorial, “House not in order”, November 19). It does sound hollow when the Prime Minister extols the virtue of the federal structure of our state and when the opposite happens elsewhere. It appears as if no amount of denouncement will stir the present dispensation in Delhi for course correction. Is the government worried that Farooq Abdullah will speak the truth? A democratic government should listen to its people and vigorously maintain the spirit of federalism and democracy.</p>
