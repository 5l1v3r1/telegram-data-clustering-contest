      <p>The Kozhikode Municipal Corporation has temporarily suspended the service of approving new building plans to facilitate a smooth sailing into the upgraded ‘Suvega’ software.</p>
      <p>The software, developed by the Bengaluru-based E-governance Foundation, is being upgraded to suit the new building policy that came into existence on November 8. The upgradation will also be carried out by the foundation.</p>
      <p>The corporation is clearing the plans submitted before midnight on November 7, based on the old building policy.</p>
      <p>All files will be cleared before the upgraded software, that approves the plans online, will be in place.</p>
      <p>The process is expected to take around a month.</p>
      <p>Initially, the software will be used for residential building permits while those for commercial building permits will be considered in the second phase, corporation sources said.</p>
