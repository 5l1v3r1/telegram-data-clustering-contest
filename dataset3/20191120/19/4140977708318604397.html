            <b>PUN Vs JHA Dream11 : Second encounter of Wednesday sees Punjab and Jharkhand go at loggerheads as either open up their Super League sojourn. </b>
          </p>
          <p>Group C and Group E second placed sides face off against each other today in the second match of the Super League of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as either strive to maraud their way into the crucial junctures of the marquee tournamnet in aplomb. When Punjab and Jharkhand meet each other in the second clash of the day today, this is a match which has imbued in place all the ingredients of being a cracker of an encounter, a match which is bound to set he league alight.</p>
          <p>Finishing behind Delhi in Group E, Jharkhand were unfortunate to not occupy a place in the pinnacles of the group despite finishing level on points with the side from the capital. Net run-rate played a decisive factor but it’s not something which will massively deter Jharkhand though with the outfit garnering the five wins from seven matches.</p>

                <p>Their most recent outing saw them cruise past Gujarat in their culminating group stage encounter as the side thumped their opponents to win by 9 wickets. Stepping out in pursuit of 129, Jharkhand’s top-order was not once perturbed by the lowly target a hand as they complimented an articulate bowling effort to perfection to cruise to a win with 9 wickets to spare.</p>
                <p>Elsewhere, things are not quite so solace filled for Punjab with the side faltering at the wrong time to go on a downward spiral right before entering this component of the tournamnet. From challenging for a spot in the echelons of the group to regressing with two defeats in three matches, the side were trounced by 45 runs in their final match as they lost their way chasing the 202 dished out infront of them by Maharashtra.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>With this being the second match of the day contested on a track which already has little in it for the bats, it is clear that the side winning the toss is undoubtedly going to come out and bat first. The wicket is going to take no time in opening up and playing fully to the capabilities of the bowlers who are ready to take pace off the ball with the spinners thriving enormously over here.</p>

                            <h3>PUN Vs JHA Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We have selected Ishan Kishan from Jharkhand for this encounter whilst from Punjab we have Simran Singh coming into our side. Our reasons for choosing both the wicket-keepers were the same with both of them not only holding escalated batting positions in their batting spots but also being players capable of opening their arms with ease and amassing a bagful of runs.</p>
                            <h3>PUN Vs JHA Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>With two 50s in his last three outings for Punjab, Anmolpreet Singh’s already gargantuan stock has risen momentously to see the batsman emerge as the leading run getter for his side till now. His 231 wins in 6 matches is a stellar number, ones which have seen him occupy a place in the pinnacles of the leading run getters in the marquee tournamnet as well.</p>
                            <p>Opener Abhishek Sharma comes in as well with the onus increasing on the opener given the departure of Shubman Gill to India’s test squad for the ongoing test match series against Bangladesh. From the opposition meanwhile we have just the one player come in for us with us brining in their leading run getter with the 236 runs in 6 matches, Vira Singh for the day.</p>
                            <h3>PUN Vs JHA Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We will be accompanied by Anand Singh for the day with the player having piled on the 142 runs in 5 matches for his side. Elsewhere it’s just the one player from Punjab as well with us choosing Gurkeerat Singh Mann owing to his attributes and traits as a bat, ones which have seen him amass 118 runs till now.</p>
                            <h3>PUN Vs JHA Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Playing on a surface which is going to be fully conducive for the spinners meant Mayank Markande from Punjab was always going to be an instant choice for us for the day. The player has yet to snare a bagful of wickets but this a track where he’ll rejoice bowling, a surface where he’ll be allowed to get massive deviation and sharp turn to see us make him an instant choice.</p>
                            <p>With 10 wickets till now quick Sandeep Sharma is brought in as well from the side while from the other side of the facet we are moving in with Utkarsh Singh with the player not only taking 6 wickets but coming up with 93 pivotal runs as well to revel us in an all round brand of cricket.</p>
                            <p>The 7 wickets for Rahul Shukla see us bring in the second player from Jharkhand to bring down the curtains on our Dream 11 side for the day.</p>
                            <p>
                              <b>Captain And Vice-Captain</b>
                            </p>
                            <p>Utkarsh Singh will be captaining our side for this one while Sandeep is being brought in as the vice-captain.</p>
