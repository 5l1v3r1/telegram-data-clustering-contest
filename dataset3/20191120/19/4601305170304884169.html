      <h1>Democrats in Congress reauthorize Patriot Act, again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:09:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1" target="_blank">Mark Frauenfelder</a></address>
      <p>"Nearly every Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to fully reauthorize the Patriot Act through March 2020, extending the right of federal agents to use all sorts of secret surveillance against Americans," reports <a href="https://reason.com/2019/11/20/democrats-overwhelmingly-vote-to-give-trumps-people-more-spying-power/">Reason</a>.</p>
      <p>As the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/patriot-act">EFF</a> says, "The USA PATRIOT Act broadly expands law enforcement's surveillance and investigative powers and represents one of the most significant threats to civil liberties, privacy, and democratic traditions in US history. [It] gives sweeping search and surveillance to domestic law enforcement and foreign intelligence agencies and eliminates checks and balances that previously gave courts the opportunity to ensure that those powers were not abused. PATRIOT and follow-up legislation now in development threaten the basic rights of millions of Americans."</p>
      <p>Kudos to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and 9 other Democrats for voting against it! And boo to the 219 Democratic representatives who voted to deprive us of our civil liberties!</p>
