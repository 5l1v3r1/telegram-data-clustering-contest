      <p>It's the year of the first-time nominee at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>After the internet discovered a partial <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanschocket2/grammy-nominations-apparently-leaked-heres-what">leak</a> of the Grammy nominations, they are now officially out — and Lizzo must be feeling good as hell.</p>
      <p>Not only is she a first-time nominee, but the singer snagged more nominations than any other artist, with a total of eight — making her the first new artist top nominee since Kanye West in 2004, reports <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8544262/lizzo-billie-eilish-lil-nas-x-grammy-nominations"><i>Billboard</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Billie Eilish, 17, made history with six nominations, making her the youngest artist to be nominated for the top four categories, per the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2019-11-20/billie-eilish-grammys-history-youngest"><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a>: best new artist, record, album, and song of the year. Lizzo is also nominated in each of the top categories, making this the first year the awards show has two new artists dominating the top four awards, per <i>Billboard</i>.</p>
      <p>After spending <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/860042/eulogy-old-town-road-19week-billboard-reign">19 weeks</a> at number one, "Old Town Road" snagged Lil Nas X a nomination for record of the year.

      <p>Notably missing from the list was breakout K-pop group BTS. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/bts-no-grammy-nominations-914664/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a> points out the award show is behind the times, as major American labels have been scooping up K-pop acts throughout 2019 and BTS's album <i>Map of the Soul: Persona </i>outsold Beyoncé's <i>Homecoming.</i></p>
      <p>For a full list of nominations, visit the <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list">Grammys</a> website. To see who comes out on top, tune into the Grammy Awards Jan. 26 on CBS. Meanwhile, the internet will continue to war over who got snubbed and who snagged a nom they didn't deserve.</p>
