      <h1>The impeachment hearing room burst into applause when a Democratic congresswoman shot back at her Republican colleague that Trump 'has 5 Pinocchios on a daily basis'</h1>

        <li>Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, was applauded in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">impeachment hearing room</a> on Wednesday when she levied a witty retort at Republican Rep. Mike Conaway.</li>
        <li>Conaway had referred to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/20/schiffs-claim-that-whistleblower-has-statutory-right-anonymity/">a recent Washington Post fact-check</a> that gave "three Pinocchios" to Democrats' claims that the Ukraine whistleblower has a "statutory right" to immunity.</li>
        <li>Speier shot back: "The president of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis, so let's not go there."</li>

      <p>Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, was applauded in the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-impeachment-major-players-timeline-what-comes-next-2019-11">impeachment hearing room</a> on Wednesday when she levied a witty comeback at Republican Rep. Mike Conaway.</p>
      <p>Conaway had referred to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/20/schiffs-claim-that-whistleblower-has-statutory-right-anonymity/">a recent Washington Post fact-check</a> that gave Democrats' claims that the Ukraine whistleblower has a "statutory right" to immunity "three Pinocchios" out of four, a rating that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/about-fact-checker/">amounts to "mostly false."</a></p>
      <p>Speier argued that, regardless, outing the whistleblower is a threat to their well-being.</p>
      <p>"The end of the article does go through that and also says it's three Pinocchios in spite of that," Conaway interrupted.</p>
      <p>Speier shot back: "The president of the United States has five Pinocchios on a daily basis, so let's not go there."</p>
      <p>The crowd broke out in laughter and applause.</p>
      <p>As of October 9, President Donald Trump had made 13,435 false or misleading claims while in office, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/14/president-trump-has-made-false-or-misleading-claims-over-days/">The Post reported</a>.</p>
