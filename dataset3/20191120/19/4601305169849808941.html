      <h1>Power going out for Northern California again, thanks PG&amp;E</h1>

      <p>As high winds, warm dry air, and extreme fire risk returns to areas of Northern and Central California today, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric is again shutting off people's electricity to reduce fire risk.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, some 375,000 accounts in Northern and central California lost power. PG&amp;E is doing this to prevent live electricity lines from sparking wildfires, as they have in the past.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://apnews.com/5a3d6bbc401a496e9962430efcf69339">Associated Press</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Some people in the wine country counties of Napa and Sonoma north of San Francisco lost power at about 7 a.m. Power was also cut farther north in portions of Mendocino, Lake and Yolo counties, said Katie Allen, a PG&amp;E spokeswoman.<br/><br/>Nearly 170,000 initially lost electricity, but the shut-offs that started Wednesday morning were expected to affect more people as the outages spread to 18 counties and last into Thursday.<br/><br/>A virtually rainless fall has left brush bone-dry and forecasts called for low humidity and winds gusting at times to 55 mph (89 kph), which might fling tree branches or other debris into power lines, causing sparks that could set catastrophic fires in the region, PG&amp;E officials said.</blockquote>
