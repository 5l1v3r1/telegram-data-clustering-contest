      <p>Mourinho put pen to paper on a deal until the end of 2022/23 after reportedly agreeing to a whopping £15 million (R287 million) per year salary.</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” he told Spurs’ official website.</p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>

      <p>The Portuguese tactician reportedly earns similar to what he was pocketing at Manchester United, and almost double as much as Pochettino did, according to <i>Daily Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>It is claimed Mourinho takes home £15 million per year, with only Guardiola earning more following his latest contract extension with Manchester City that sees him bag £20 million (R382 million) annually.</p>
      <p>Guardiola is the best-paid coach in England, but Mourinho has moved back into second place, while Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp and Manchester United’s Ole Gunnar Solskjaer jointly complete the top three.</p>
