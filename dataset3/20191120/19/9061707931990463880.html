      <h2>The roundabout is the site of near misses on a regular basis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:58:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Bisknell</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of driving instructors have succeeded in their call for changes at a notorious Derbyshire roundabout.</p>
      <p>Horns Bridge Roundabout in Chesterfield is one of the most infamous junctions in the East Midlands.</p>
      <p>The large roundabout on the south-east side of Chesterfield has five arms and sees the joining of the A61, A617 (the town’s main and busiest through-routes) and Spire Walk.</p>
      <p>Drivers say it is complicated to navigate and sees numerous near misses on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>Now, 26 advanced driving instructors have put pen to paper and signed a petition, submitted to Derbyshire County Council, calling for changes to the signs surrounding the roundabout.</p>
      <p>They claim that the advanced direction signs are to blame for much of the confusion and danger on the roundabout and have called for changes.</p>
      <p>Council officers say that the roundabout sees 75,000 vehicles pass through it on a typical weekday.</p>

      <p>They agree that making changes to advanced direction signs would allow motorists to make earlier decisions on which lane they need to get in – cutting down on late changes and near misses.</p>
      <p>Officers say that from June 2016 to May 2019, there have been nine crashes on the roundabout – all of a “slight severity” – which they say is “considered good” when considering the number of vehicles that use it every day.</p>
      <p>The council’s cabinet member for highways, Cllr Simon Spencer, is due to host a meeting on Thursday, November 21 to agree to spend £10,000 to make the sign changes.</p>
      <p>A report on the issue says that the advanced driving instructors had called for: “Amendments to be made to the destination wording on existing advanced direction signs situated on the A617 on the approach to the roundabout, together with new signage installed on the A617 further back from the roundabout.</p>
      <p>“There was also a request for improvements to be made to advanced direction signs when approaching the roundabout from the A61 southbound.”</p>
      <p>Council officers said in the report: “Whilst officers feel that the current destination signage and lane markings are adequate to allow a motorist to select the correct lane and negotiate the roundabout, additional place name information on the advanced direction signs on the A61 southbound and A617 westbound approaches would be helpful in allowing a motorist to make an earlier decision over which is the correct lane to select prior to entering the roundabout.</p>
      <p>“As is alluded to by the petitioner, part of the issue is caused by drivers ignoring the information given to them over which is the correct lane to select depending on their chosen destination, resulting in a late change of lane.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, it is common driver behaviour to try to beat queuing traffic by swapping lanes at the last possible moment.</p>
      <p>“However, recognising that improvements to advanced direction signage could reduce collision numbers, it is recommended that these works be carried out.”</p>
