      <p>MONTREAL -- A three-part documentary series about the online sleuths who helped track down the infamous killer Luka Magnotta is coming to Netflix.</p>
      <p>The streaming service says the series will follow the story of internet users across the world who jumped into action after a video of an unknown man killing two kittens was posted online.</p>
      <p>The online manhunt intensified as more disturbing videos were posted, including the infamous clip showing the dismemberment of 33-year-old university student Jun Lin.</p>
      <p>The now 37-year-old Magnotta was convicted in December 2014 of first-degree murder in the slaying of Lin, as well as several other counts, and is currently serving a life sentence.</p>
      <p>At his trial, Magnotta admitted to killing and dismembering Lin but had sought to be found not criminally responsible by way of mental disorder.</p>
      <p>Netflix says the series, titled "Don't F....k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer," launches Dec. 18.</p>
