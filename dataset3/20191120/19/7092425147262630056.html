        <b>Ireland now know they'll be facing Slovakia in an away play-off semi-final in their quest to make Euro 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's a one-off game so the task is simple, win!</p>
      <p>Despite the disappointing result, Ireland put in what was probably their best display in years in the 1-1 draw with Denmark.</p>
      <p>Two of our best players were full-backs Enda Stevens and Matt Doherty.</p>
      <p>The pair marauded up the wings and caused the Danes problems throughout.</p>
      <p>This was despite the fact they were playing very different roles to the ones they occupy every week for Sheffield United and Wolves.</p>
      <p>The pair managed to get forward a lot in the last game but they'd be best suited to playing as wing backs.</p>
      <p>That's why we feel Mick McCarthy should go for a 3-5-2 formation for the crucial Slovakia clash.</p>
      <p>Here's what we feel the most likely line-up would be in that system, given the players McCarthy prefers.</p>

      <p>It'd be mad to drop Doherty after how well he played against the Danes but that poses a problem with captain Seamus Coleman returning from suspension.</p>
      <p>He's been struggling for form but McCarthy is unlikely to drop him, and in fairness Coleman has been one of our most consistent players over the years.</p>
      <p>To fit both players into the team, Coleman could slot into the right side of the back three.</p>
      <p>Of course this isn't his natural role but with Duffy and Egan beside him he'd fit in well and his defensive abilities would make him well suited to the role.</p>
      <p>Glenn Whelan has been great in the holding midfield role and he's joined by Conor Hourihane and Alan Browne.</p>
      <p>McCarthy rarely drops his favourites but Jeff Hendrick could lose out here after another anonymous display.</p>
      <p>On performances, James McClean really should be relegated to the bench.</p>
      <p>That's never going to happen though so the only way this works with him in the team is for him to play as a second striker.</p>
      <p>He's done this on a number of occasions for Ireland before and it would arguably be a more effective role for him with the amount of ground he covers.</p>
      <p>Up front it's David McGoldrick.</p>
      <p>Again, the key thing about this line-up is Stevens and Doherty.</p>
      <p>The pair look like our most creative players and with the back three behind them, they'd be free to get high up the field and create plenty of chances.</p>

      <p>Now, this is the team we'd like to see.</p>
      <p>It was a toss up with Coleman and Clark, and it would be just as good with Coleman in, but the Newcastle man has been in better form and looked good after coming on against Denmark.</p>
      <p>It's also three proven centre-backs and would lessen the chance of Coleman making a mistake in an unfamiliar system after his nightmare against Switzerland.</p>
      <p>Having said all that, we'd still have faith in him.</p>
      <p>The midfield three may look too defensive with Whelan and James McCarthy but bear with us.</p>
      <p>McCarthy should be back to full fitness by March and he's one of our most talented players, there's no question about that.</p>
      <p>Alongside Whelan, we'd have a solid base that would allow Stevens and Doherty to get forward even more.</p>
      <p>Whelan and McCarthy would be well able for an intense midfield battle too, which is guaranteed against Slovakia.</p>
      <p>This would also allow Hourihane's attacking threat to influence the game, as he'd have less defensive responsibilities.</p>
      <p>Up front, Aaron Connolly's pace and skill would be ideal to link up with David McGoldrick, who looked isolated at times despite a great performance against Denmark.</p>
      <p>Stevens and Doherty would be able to create plenty of chances against the pair.</p>
      <p>Against Denmark, they both covered huge ground and were essentially doing the wing back role in a flat back four.</p>
      <p>This did work well in fairness but it may have seen tiredness creep in for two mistakes, one that proved costly and another that didn't.</p>
      <p>Doherty let Martin Braithwaite free for the first goal while Stevens hit the ball straight at an opponent at one point, nearly leading to a one-on-one but for a brilliant sprint back from McClean.</p>
      <p>They'd have a little bit more freedom in this system, which could be the key to more goals.</p>
