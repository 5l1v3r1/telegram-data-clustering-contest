      <p>The cases are similar to previous <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/smart+battery+case">Smart Battery Cases</a> that Apple has released in the past. Each case features a microfiber-lined interior, soft-touch silicone exterior, and slides off via a soft elastomer hinge.<br/><br/>New to this line of cases, however, is a dedicated camera button that launches the Camera app regardless of whether or not the iPhone is unlocked. Quickly pressing the button will take a photo, while a long press will capture video.<br/><br/>The <a href="http://appleinsider.com/topic/iphone+11">iPhone 11</a> line of smart battery cases are compatible with Qi-certified chargers. At maximum charge, the cases can give up to 50 percent longer battery life. There's an integrated feature that shows the battery status on the lock screen and Notification Center, which isn't available with non-Apple battery cases.<br/><br/>The case is also fast-charge compatible with any USB-PD compatible charger, and leaves the lightning port unobstructed so users can plug in their <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/earpods">EarPods</a> or Lightning-to-3.5 millimeter audio adapter.<br/><br/>Those interested in the cases can head to Apple's online store. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVJ2LL/A/iphone-11-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-soft-white?fnode=97">iPhone 11</a> case is available in soft white or black, while the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVL2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black">iPhone 11 Pro</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWVP2LL/A/iphone-11-pro-max-smart-battery-case-with-wireless-charging-black?fnode=97">iPhone 11 Pro Max</a> cases are available in soft white, black, and pink sand. All three retail for $129.<br/><br/>For a more affordable alternative to Apple's offerings, shoppers can pick up <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-1989299-13813156?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zagg.com%2Fen_us%2Fbattery-cases">Mophie's Juice Pack Access Battery Case</a> for the iPhone 11 for $63.96, a 20% discount with exclusive promo code <b>INSIDER20</b> at ZAGG.</p>
