      <h1>Best gaming laptops for 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:15:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/jorge-jimenez/" target="_blank">Jorge Jimenez</a></address>
      <p>Need a way to play all the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-pc-games/">best PC games</a> on the go? A gaming laptop gives you all the power and performance of a desktop with the added benefit of being able to pick up and game away from your desk.</p>
      <p>So, what to look for when you're shopping around for the best gaming laptop. Your budget always plays a big factor. First, lock down a price range, whether it's under $1000 or splurging on a $3000 system with all the bells and whistles. Below we've divided up our favorite gaming laptops into different price tiers. </p>
      <p>If you don't know where to start, we recommend choosing a laptop with at least an Nvidia RTX 2060 or 2070 graphics card for the best gaming performance. That will let you play most games on high graphical presets and fairly decent framerates. If you want to save some cash, laptops with older higher-end GTX cards will be cheaper, but you'll lose out on the RTX cards' features like ray tracing and DLSS. If you want to live around the $1000 dollar price range, we've seen some GTX 1660 Ti-powered systems that are great choices. RTX 20-series laptops will be future-proof for the next few years, being you even need to consider an upgrade. </p>
      <p>For displays, we like anything with an IPS screen at a 120Hz refresh rate. While 4K screens look great, At a minimum, your system should have 16GB of RAM, an Intel i7 processor, and a modestly sized SSD for storage. </p>
      <p>Other features to consider mostly depend on how you plan to use your gaming laptop. If you do a lot of traveling, a lightweight laptop with a good battery that'll last as long as a flight might be a bigger priority for you than a heavy workstation. OLED screens provide great colors if you do you a lot of video editing or love to binge out on TV. Webcams (and webcam placement) on gaming laptops are notoriously hit or miss, so always think about that. We have recommendations for the best gaming laptops, depending on your specific needs. </p>
      <p>Leading the pack is the Razer Blade 15 Enhanced Model gaming laptop. The RTX 2080 model gave us impressive gaming benchmark scores that rival some of the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-pc/">best gaming desktops</a>. It's got the portability, performance and battery life we want in a gaming laptop which is why it makes the top of our list.  We are plenty aware that not everything has around two grand to spend on a gaming laptop, that's why we highlighted some of the best budget gaming laptops like the Acer Predator Helios 300. It's the best gaming laptop under $1,000 we reviewed this year allowing for some great 1080p gaming without needing to max out your credit cards. </p>

      <p>Unparalleled build quality<br/>Wide range of CPU/GPU options<br/>Costs more for the same<br/>No longer thinnest or lightest</p>
      <p>Not much has changed since the advent of the original Razer Blade 15 in spring 2018. The refreshed, so-called "Advanced Model" is outfitted with the same CNC-milled aluminum chassis as its predecessor, only this time it holds the latest graphics chips from Nvidia, namely the RTX family of Turing architecture-based GPUs. </p>
      <p>Among its configurations are an RTX 2080 model, capable of running the ray traced Metro Exodus at over 50fps with all the visual settings cranked to the top. In our testing, despite its power-hungry guts, it wowed us with an unusual 5 hour and 1 minute battery life. So while it's no longer the thinnest or the lightest in its class, it is the longest-lasting premium gaming laptops we've seen to date. It's also one of the more expensive. </p>
      <p>You could argue that's because the Razer Blade 15 aims to replace not only your desktop but your existing laptop, too. After all, its touchpad is the closest thing to a MacBook trackpad you will find on a Windows notebook. That includes non-gaming laptops like the Dell XPS 13, which is met with staggering acclaim each time it's re-packaged and re-released. In just about every way, the Razer Blade 15 feels like a dream. Chalk it up to the engineering talent. Razer now makes the best gaming laptop on the market. Whether others will follow suit, taking inspiration from the well-rounded machine, remains to be seen. </p>
      <p>Also bad for its competitors is the fact that the Razer Blade 15 is available in an abundance of different flavors, most of which actually makes a lot of sense. If you want a 4K OLED screen, it's exclusive to an RTX 2080 configuration, perhaps the only Max-Q graphics card that could hope to drive 4K graphics. More likely is that you'll opt for one of the many higher volume 1080p 144Hz models, lest you'll wind up playing at 1440p, thereby stymieing its true potential. </p>
      <p>Whatever the case, you can take solace in the fact that the Razer Blade 15 Advanced Model is the overall best gaming laptop on the market right now, and until someone else steps up to the plate to contest this crowning achievement, it will continue to sit here at the top of this list. </p>

      <p>Sleek and powerful<br/>Long battery life<br/>144Hz screen<br/>No G-Sync</p>
      <p>The GS65 Stealth Thin is the best gaming laptop we tested in 2018. It's a fantastic all-rounder that still packs a punch in terms of specs and design. It has the versatility of a notebook and, because it's light and sturdy, it's incredibly easy to just pop into your bag and carry round all day for whatever you need to use it for. It has a sleek matte black aluminum body with gold accents that feels sturdy and luxe—and thankfully lacking in obnoxious gamer aesthetics. Best of all, in addition to a slim, 18mm thickness, the screen's 4.9mm thin bezels allow for a overall chassis size that's about an inch smaller than most 15-inch laptops, while still packing the same screen real-estate. </p>
      <p>While it won't do ray-tracing, the spec here is enough to handle most modern games in 2019. However, the MSI GS65 Stealth Thin models are in something of a transition right now. It's tough to track down the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4P08256627&amp;Description=msi%20gs65%20stealth%201070&amp;cm_re=msi_gs65_stealth_1070-_-34-154-805-_-Product">1070 build</a>, which is probably the best, unless you want a mind-boggling 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. You can still get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-GS65-Stealth-THIN-051-i7-8750H/dp/B07BB7XN8C?psc=1&amp;SubscriptionId=AKIAIPHVZTVH6LZ5BFZA&amp;tag=hawk-future-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07BB7XN8C&amp;ascsubtag=pcg-6077575415648702246-20">1060 model, with a 16GB RAM spec and 256GB SSD</a>, which shaves a massive amount off the price, but cuts performance a little. You can also buy the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/msi-gs75-stealth-review/">newer 2070 models</a>, but they're super expensive too, and didn't impress as much during testing.</p>
      <p>There are other nice details on the GS65, which still makes it a great laptop: a keyboard from SteelSeries that's solid and responsive (and RGB-lit, if you care about that sort of thing), a responsive touchpad, and a webcam that's placed at the top of the screen, thankfully avoiding the abysmally unflattering "nose-cam" found on most thin-bezeled laptops like the Dell XPS 13.</p>
      <p>The only gaming feature missing here is G-Sync, but this allows for both a lower price tag and battery life that legitimately lasts through a whole day of email, web browsing, and streaming video.</p>

      <p>Incredible value<br/>Decent battery life<br/>Brings a 1660 Ti GPU<br/>Small storage</p>
      <p>We loved Acer's Predator Helios 300 during the 10-series era: at just over a grand, sometimes less if you could find it on sale, it offered a GTX 1060 6GB graphics card that could lock down 60 fps at near-max settings in most games from the last few years. Now the newer model Helios is back with a GTX 1660 Ti GPU and a sleeker form factor for basically the same price. </p>
      <p>The new and improved Helios 300 has a 144Hz IPS screen as well as smaller bezels, putting it more in line with sleek thin-and-lights than its more bulky brethren of the previous generation. RAM speed has been bumped up to 2666Mhz as well, which is a nice improvement. The only real drawback here is the diminutive SSD, although there are larger storage options (thankfully all in SSD form) if you want more space.</p>

      <p>Excellent, cutting-edge performance<br/>Approachable range of prices<br/>Extremely small touchpad<br/>Dated outward design</p>
      <p>Though they've existed for a couple of years now, Lenovo's Legion-branded laptops have made a name for themselves in the games industry, if only because they offer unprecedented value on top-notch specs. </p>
      <p>Rather than crafting a jacks of all trades, the Chinese tech company—known primarily for its ThinkPads—aims to squeeze the most performance out of the cheapest possible materials without compromising on quality and design. This principle is nowhere more evident than in the Lenovo Legion Y740, a 17.3-inch gaming laptop, whose graphics chip ranges from Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 to 2080, and for a fraction of the price of its major competitors. </p>
      <p>Sure, "considerably thinner than previous generations" as they may be, its bezels are bigger and more distracting than the norm. But the screen itself leverages technology rarely seen elsewhere. Dolby Vision HDR, for example, is in full bloom on this fluid 144Hz IPS display. And G-Sync eliminates the need for software-based adaptive sync protocols, such as v-sync, which notoriously reeks of input lag and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/what-is-microstutter-and-how-do-i-fix-it/">microstuttering</a>. </p>
      <p>On the audio end, the Y740 is graced with another striking Dolby technology, Atmos, by way of a fine-tuned onboard soundbar that emits a wide range of crisp frequencies, valuing midrange and bass tones in equal measure. Built into its Windows 10 Home install is the Dolby Atmos software as well, paving the way for customizable EQ profiles and nearly making up for the down-firing orientation of the speakers. </p>
      <p>If real-time ray tracing is your endgame, the Lenovo Legion Y740 does not disappoint. In fact, in the Metro Exodus RTX benchmark, which sees most of the in-game graphics settings cranked all the way up, the Y740 managed an impressive average of 46fps. Temper a few of those sliders and you can bank on a buttery smooth 60fps, with raytracing turned on, for about 30% less than the cost of its premium-priced rivals configured with the same specs.</p>

      <p>Appetizing range of prices<br/>Top of the line performance<br/>Lackluster battery life<br/>Awful boot-up sound</p>
      <p>Not everyone needs the <i>thinnest </i>or the <i>most powerful</i> gaming laptop. Sometimes still-thin and still-powerful is just fine. Striking a healthy balance between portability, performance, and price is the Acer Predator Triton 500, a Max-Q notebook that emerged from somewhere to impress our dedicated team of hardware testers at the top-secret PC Gamer lab. Wielding an RTX 2080, the model we reviewed is priced somewhere in the middle at $2,499. However, you can find an RTX 2060 version at the $1,799 mark. </p>
      <p>Either way, it's well worth your while, seeing as it can push Metro Exodus at the highest settings, with ray tracing on, at an average pace of 56fps. And while it's doing so, you get to experience the luxury of its deeply satisfying 1.7mm keyboard travel and a Microsoft precision touchpad that we surprisingly don't hate. Despite its terrifying default boot-up noise, the Acer Predator Triton 500 is one for the books.</p>

      <p>Thin bezels<br/>Easy to upgrade RAM and storage<br/>No included SSD</p>
      <p>The MSI GL63 8RC has to be our top choice for ultra-budget gaming laptops. Priced as low as $649.99 on sale, the GL63 comes equipped with Intel’s i5-8300H, 8GB of DDR4 RAM, Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1050 and one of the thinner bezels we’ve seen in this price range. The only obvious downside is the lack of an included SSD. The laptop comes loaded with a 1TB HDD which means you’ll probably want to upgrade the storage fairly quickly.</p>
      <p>With its highly competitive price tag, the MSI GL63 8RC is one of the cheapest gaming laptops we could find with a GTX 1050 discrete graphics card. It’s priced just a little bit higher than Acer’s Aspire E 15, but the GF63 offers up to 67 percent higher gaming performance and exponentially higher performance when compared to laptops with integrated graphics. If you’re working with a tight budget, the GL63 offers everything you’d need in a laptop without putting a huge dent in your wallet.</p>

      <p>Incredible battery life<br/>Beautiful screen<br/>Powerful laptop<br/>Rough edges<br/>Some driver issues out of the box</p>
      <p>Gigabyte's Aero 15X was the first thin Max-Q laptop to catch our eye, and the 2018 Aero 15X v8 refresh remains a promising entry in the field, fixing most of the issues I had with its predecessor while keeping everything else that I love about it. Primarily, the keyboard works much better after a driver update, and the screen's been updated to a snappy 144 Hz panel. </p>
      <p>Compared to MSI's GS65 and the Razer Blade 15, the Aero 15X has a less attractive body with sharp edges, but wins in the productivity category on account of a bigger, 94 Whr battery. In practice—that is, our streaming video test—that larger battery lasts upwards of six hours, compared to the GS65's four and a half. With near-identical internals, gaming performance is comparable to the GS65 as well. The biggest difference, other than the body design and battery, is that the Aero 15X can be outfitted with a 4K screen. I recommend sticking with the high refresh rate 1080p screen if gaming is your primary concern, but 4K is a nice option for productivity power users who can take advantage of the extra pixels.</p>

      <p>Slick looks<br/>Potent RTX graphics<br/>Schlocky paint job<br/>Uncomfortable touchpad</p>
      <p>When Nvidia announced its Max-Q design initiative nearly two years ago, the Big Graphics company said the best gaming laptop would get thinner and lighter yet <i>more powerful</i> than the beefy notebooks which preceded it. If nothing else, the MSI GS75 Stealth serves as evidence to back up that claim. With its posh, black and gold design—glarily inspired by the 15-inch GS65 Stealth Thin before it—the GS75 Stealth is a handsome and perfectly good 17-inch lappy on the outside, minus its susceptibility to paint chipping. Oh, and the touchpad woes.</p>
      <p>Snug inside its aluminum alloy chassis is a hardy GeForce RTX graphics card, spanning almost Nvidia's whole line of ray trace-capable products, paired with an Intel Core i7-8750H processor no matter which configuration you buy. Be that as it may, every version of the GS75 Stealth exceeds two grand, making it a tough sell for budget-minded gamers. We, of course, reviewed the utmost expensive model, housing a Max-Q-size RTX 2080 and 32GB of RAM. Decimating the competition, it ran Shadow of the Tomb Raider in 1080p at 87fps, and that was at the highest graphics preset. Pretty incredible for a clamshell PC weighing less than five pounds.</p>

      <p>Full-power (non Max-Q) GTX 1070<br/>Great SSD<br/>Bulky<br/>Poor battery life</p>
      <p>I said at the beginning that choosing a laptop usually means picking two between price, performance, and portability. Where thin-and-light laptops like the GS65 offer the latter two of those three, the Asus ROG Strix GL503VS-DH74 Scar Edition instead checks the first two boxes: price and performance. </p>
      <p>In exchange for a larger shell, the GL503VS packs in a regular (non Max-Q) GTX 1070 GPU. This results in a performance improvement of around 15 percent at a slightly lower price point. It uses a previous gen quad-core CPU, but that doesn't matter in most games. The GL503VS also offers G-Sync on its 144Hz panel, but the tradeoff means you miss out on Nvidia's Optimus battery tech. As such, you shouldn't expect more than around two hours of battery life. Don't forget your charger!</p>

      <p>Great design and build<br/>Well-considered set of components<br/>Nicely balanced and great value<br/>Incredibly loud fans<br/>Dim display<br/>Sub-par touchpad<br/>No built-in camera</p>
      <p>Proving that you really don't have to throw money at the situation to get a great performing gaming laptop, the GA502 is an entry- to mid-level machine that is very comfortable in its own skin. It's got a sleek, slim and attractive design that's not outlandish by any means so you can still happily use it as your day to day machine, out and about too without raising too many eyebrows. </p>
      <p>Under the hood, there's a Ryzen 7 CPU teamed with a GTX 1660Ti GPU and 16GB of RAM and two 512GB SSDs. These headline specs are, clearly, not that of a powerhouse, but one that knows its place in the middle or entry-level zone of the pack and is happy with that. It's nor trying to be anything it's not and really does offer a great way into PC gaming generally, as well as the portable variety, with strong performance—at medium or high settings. It will absolutely fly for esports games like Fortnite, Overwatch and Rocket League, but will still hold up and give you a great experience in more demanding recent games like The Division 2 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Plus, given that modern 'medium' settings are still things of great beauty and the equivalent of 'high' settings from only a few years ago (to the eye anyway), it really isn't a bad compromise.</p>
      <p>A few downsides hold it back from being truly amazing—but you still have to remember its positioning in the market, build and price tag—its 15.6-inch vIPS Full HD display is a bit dim, the touchpad is suboptimal and the fans are <i>really</i> loud. But, all in, if you turn the settings down just a bit, you can still play everything you want on the Zephyrus GA502 and have an absolute blast and not break the band doing so.</p>
      <h3>How we test gaming laptops</h3>
      <p>What makes one laptop more attractive than another in the eyes of a gamer? Is it light weight, for portability in between LAN parties? How about high-end hardware to facilitate the fastest frame rates? Surely connectivity matters. External displays, gaming peripherals and direct-attached storage can make you forget you’re even using a notebook. Or maybe value is what matters most. For a low-enough price, we’re all willing to compromise on graphics quality, right? <i>Right?</i></p>
      <p>Of course not, which is why the best builders cram in as much processing muscle as possible, even when money is tight. And at the top of the range, desktop-class components in mobile enclosures set new performance records with every generation.</p>
      <p>We run the following tests to measure performance and productivity on gaming laptops:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cinebench 15</li>
        <li>CrystalDisk QD32 Read and Write</li>
        <li>3DMark Fire Strike</li>
        <li>PCMark 10 Express</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For gaming, we use the built-in benchmarks on The Division 2, Total War: Warhammer II, and Metro Exodus. Tests are performed at 1080p using the highest available graphics preset, with V-sync and G-Sync disabled, unless the laptop in question is packing a higher resolution display (and the hardware to support playing at higher resolutions). In that case we'll generally test at FHD and QHD, or QHD and 4K. All tests are run multiple times to ensure that thermal throttling doesn't occur and to eliminate outliers/erroneous results. In the event that scores drop on subsequent tests, the lower (throttled) scores are used. </p>
