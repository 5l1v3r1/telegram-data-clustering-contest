      <p>Set in the dark, early days of a zombie apocalypse, <b>“Black Summer”</b> stars<b> Jaime King </b>as Rose, a mother torn from her daughter who embarks upon a harrowing journey to find her.</p>
      <p>Thrust alongside a small group of American refugees, these complete strangers must find the strength they need to fight their way back to loved ones. But in order for Rose and her team to brave this hostile new world, they will need to make brutal decisions to contend with zombies – and each other.</p>
      <p>Just in time for the summer, the eight-episode zombie series arrived on Netflix to rave reviews and even <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/tv/3555737/stephen-king-raves-new-netflix-zombie-series-black-summer/">heavy support from Stephen King</a>. Now, Netflix has officially renewed the series for a second season that is likely to return in 2020.</p>
      <p>Here’s the first season’s trailer. What did you think of the show? John Squires wrote that <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/editorials/3559259/netflixs-black-summer-two-things-better-walking-dead/">“Black Summer” does these two things better than “The Walking Dead”. </a></p>
