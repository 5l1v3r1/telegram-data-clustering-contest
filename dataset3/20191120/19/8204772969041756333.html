      <h1>Sunday Business Post to drop Sunday from title in rebrand</h1>
      <h2>Masthead change comes 30 years after first edition of the newspaper</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:01:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/laura-slattery-7.1010637" target="_blank">Laura Slattery</a></address>
      <p>The Sunday Business Post will drop “Sunday” from its masthead this weekend and rebrand as the Business Post.</p>
      <p>The title will continue to publish a print newspaper every Sunday, with the new name for the newspaper introduced as part of a relaunch of its digital publishing activities throughout the week.</p>
      <p>The move was signalled by owner Enda O’Coineen in September in an interview on Newstalk.</p>
      <p>It comes almost exactly 30 years after the publication of the first edition of the newspaper on November 26th, 1989, after it was founded by <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Damien+Kiberd">Damien Kiberd</a>, Aileen O’Toole, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Frank+Fitzgibbon">Frank Fitzgibbon</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=James+Morrissey">James Morrissey</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr O’Coineen, a Galway businessman, bought the Sunday Business Post last year through <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Kilcullen+Kapital+Partners">Kilcullen Kapital Partners</a>. Kilcullen’s Colm O’Reilly has since become chief executive of the title, while <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Richie+Oakley">Richie Oakley</a>, the former editor of Times Ireland, was appointed editor in July.</p>
      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>The executive team also includes <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sarah+Murphy">Sarah Murphy</a>, who heads up the events side of the business, Business Post Events.</p>
      <p>Under its former owners, the title first launched a daily digital news service on the site Businesspost.ie in 2011.</p>
      <p>The rebranding follows Business Post Media Group’s acquisition of a portfolio of magazines, including Irish Tatler and Food &amp; Wine, from Irish Studio, with Irish Studio taking an undisclosed minority stake in BPMG under the deal.</p>
