      <p>Paddington Bear is returning in a new TV series with a theme tune performed by Gary Barlow.</p>
      <p>The animated pre-school show – entitled The Adventures Of Paddington – centres on a younger Paddington as he writes letters to Aunt Lucy celebrating the new things he has discovered through the day’s activities.</p>
      <p>Actor Ben Whishaw reprises his role as the voice of writer Michael Bond’s much-loved bear, after voicing him in the Paddington films in 2014 and 2017.</p>
      <p>The programme will feature a brand new theme song called Paddington Bear, which was written and performed by Take That star Barlow.</p>

      <p>The singer shared a picture on Instagram showing him with the bear after the news was announced.</p>
      <p>“Very happy to announce that I’ve written the new theme song for ‘The Adventures of Paddington’!” he said.</p>
      <p>Presumably referring to his daughter Daisy, he added: “I hope you like it and our Daisy and her friends have a feature on the track !!!”</p>
