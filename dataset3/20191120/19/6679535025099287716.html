      <p>Aswin B.S. has made it to the State School Arts Festival for the second time running.</p>
      <p>The Plus Two Bio-Maths student of RKD NSS HSS, Sasthamangalam, bagged the first A grade in Kathakali Sangeetham at the Revenue District School Arts Festival on Wednesday, realising his fatherâ€™s wish too in the process.</p>
      <p>Aswin, who had secured A grade in the event at the State festival last year, hopes to top the competition this time around.</p>
      <p>His father Biju S. Nair, ASI, Special Branch, who for various reasons could not learn music wanted both this sons to get the opportunity he did not. So, Aswin started learning music very young.</p>
      <p>Though he has been learning Kathakali Sangeetham under Priyanka for the past three years, Carnatic music is his first love. Irinjalakuda Vijaykumar is his guru.</p>
      <p>Aswin has also participated in Vande Mataram and Sanskrit group song events at the State level earlier.</p>
      <p>Aswin also looks up to his brother Aromal, a second year English Literature student who is also a semi-finalist in the programme Paadam Namakku Paadam.</p>
      <p>Keen on pursuing engineering after school, Aswin also hopes to take part in reality shows like his brother.</p>
