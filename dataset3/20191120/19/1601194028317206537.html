      <p>Former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/india-national-cricket-team">Indian </a>opener <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sunil-gavaskar">Sunil Gavaskar</a> is of the view that statistics and records of day-night Tests should be maintained independently and not clubbed with the numbers of regular Test matches.</p>
      <p>Gavaskar made this <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/pink-ball-test-stats-should-be-maintained-separately-sunil-gavaskar-2135601">suggestion</a> during the build-up to Indiaâ€™s first-ever day-night Test, set to be played at Eden Gardens in Kolkata from November 22.</p>
      <blockquote>"The thing I feel is that the stats for pink-ball Test cricket should be separately maintained from red-ball cricket."</blockquote>
      <p>Gavaskar went on to add that there should be some sort of distinction between red-ball and white-ball cricket when it comes to the limited-overs formats as well.</p>
      <blockquote>"Similarly, for limited-overs cricket also the stats should be separate for red-ball and white-ball, or some sort of distinction made so that future generations can know what was what."</blockquote>
      <p>Gavaskar, who was the first batsman to breach the 10,000-run mark in Test cricket, expressed confidence in the notion that pink-ball cricket is here to stay.</p>
      <blockquote>"When day-night cricket started not many thought it would be successful but look at the huge following it has now, so there's no reason to believe that day-night Test cricket won't be successful too."</blockquote>

      <p>Gavaskar also showered praise on Team India and explained that their lack of experience playing with the pink ball will not be an impediment to their chances in the Kolkata Test.</p>
      <p>The Little Master along with Kapil Dev, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, and Anil Kumble will be present to witness history being created at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>India are 1-0 in up the two-match Test series, having gotten the better of Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs in the first Test at Indore.</p>
