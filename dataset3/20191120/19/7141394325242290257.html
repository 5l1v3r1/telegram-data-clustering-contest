      <h1>Crypto Users Flocking to LocalBitcoins to Buy BTC, Company Reports 135,000 New Users Per Month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:35:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Sebastian Sonntag, the CEO of LocalBitcoins, a leading peer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin (BTC) exchange, reveals that the platform consistently adds around 135,000 new users each month. He says LocalBitcoins aims to “bring Bitcoin everywhere” by making services available to as many Bitcoin traders as possible throughout the world. </p>
      <p>Sonntag, whose comments came during a recent interview published by <a href="https://learnbonds.com/news/localbitcoins-ceo-we-maintain-positive-growth-of-135000-new-users-monthly/">LearnBonds</a>, clarifies that all altcoin transactions made via LocalBitcoins are processed by third-party services. While LocalBitcoins is not planning in the near future to offer wallets for cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin, Sonntag says that Ether (ETH), XRP and Litecoin (LTC) may be used as payment for purchasing and selling Bitcoin (BTC) on the platform.</p>
      <p>Commenting on future improvements to LocalBitcoins, he remarks,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“[We] enabled multiple simultaneous open trades to make trading faster and more convenient… LocalBitcoins is restructuring internally, and one of the priorities … will be to … review the users’ concerns and requests, so we can evaluate what are the most needed features and progressively introduce more customer-facing improvements during 2020.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Traders around the world using the platform continue to smash records with recent all-time-high trading volumes set in Argentina and Venezuela, according to data compiled by <a href="https://coin.dance/volume/localbitcoins">Coin.dance</a>, as the number of blockchain wallet users reached a high of 43.5 million this month, according to data compiled by <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/my-wallet-n-users">Blockchain.info</a>.</p>
