      <h1>Under-used Everton players that could be crucial to Marco Silva after international return</h1>
      <h2>An important few weeks for Everton and Marco Silva is fast approaching</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>There's an important month on the horizon for Everton.</p>
      <p>The start to this campaign has been a disappointing one and there's no escaping that, despite a slight upturn in form and results over the last month or so.</p>
      <p>Those have steadied the ship and relieved the pressure on Marco Silva to an extent, but the Blues are still languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League and that can't be allowed to continue.</p>
      <p>On the positive side, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> are in the quarter finals of the Carabao Cup and will face Leicester at Goodison Park in December for a place in the next round of the competiton.</p>
      <p>That game will add to a hectic schedule for the club over the next few weeks and continuing into the new year, a period in which the manager will have to utilise the full squad of players at his disposal.</p>
      <p>So, aside from the obvious, who could prove themselves crucial over the next few weeks?</p>
      <p>There are three in particular who have been under-used for one reason or another, and could use December to really kick-start their campaigns.</p>
      <h3>Moise Kean</h3>
      <p>It's not quite happened for the striker yet, but that doesn't mean it won't.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has been forced to wait for his opportunity at Everton so far this season as <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/marco-silva">Marco Silva</a> has opted for players with more Premier League experience such as Dominic Calvert-Lewin or, more recently, Cenk Tosun.</p>
      <p>With there being so much excitement around the promising young forward's arrival in the summer, there's no doubt this beginning has been a little bit disappointing for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/moise-kean">Moise Kean</a>.</p>

      <p>However, the next few weeks could well bring more opportunities for the striker.</p>
      <p>It's well documented that the Blues have a difficult run through December, across the festive period and into January, with a lot of big matches in quick succession.</p>
      <p>Silva will always be likely to shake up his options over this time as players become fatigued and the manager will want to keep his side as fresh as possible, meaning there will be minutes on offer for Kean.</p>
      <p>Perhaps, the big stage could be what the striker was waiting for. Perhaps, he can take advantage of some stretched defences to finally get that first goal in a Blue shirt.</p>
      <p>If he can carry on that form from the international break then he could give Everton the much-needed option of goals from the bench.</p>
      <h3>Bernard</h3>
      <p>Everton fans haven't been treated to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/bernard">Bernard's</a> skills since the end of October, after the Brazilian was substituted in the first half of the loss to Brighton with a knee ligament injury.</p>
      <p>However, after missing three matches in the lead up to the international break, it was revealed earlier this month that there was hope from the manager on the 27-year-old's return.</p>
      <p>Silva <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-boss-marco-silva-sets-17209631">told the ECHO</a>: "I would like to see him again after the international break.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I know I am putting some pressure on our medical staff and on my staff to get him in a good condition.</p>
      <p>"You know, we always have a date in our mind and it is always a bit big but I am trying to put the normal pressure on them to see if Bernard will be with us after the international break but let's see."</p>
      <p>If he is back, then Bernard could be a fantastic asset to Everton.</p>
      <p>The match against West Ham in October was arguably the winger's best for the club, and the Blues will need as many players as possible to put in that level of performance as they face up to this difficult run.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has the ability to unlock a defence at the drop of a hat, with the kind of skill and vision his teammates can't match.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian has only managed six Premier League starts thanks to form and injury issues this term, however, and could now have a chance to really put that right.</p>
      <h3>Fabian Delph</h3>
      <p>Unfortunately, it's been a bit of a stop-start campaign for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/fabian-delph">Fabian Delph</a> so far.</p>
      <p>The midfielder made the move to Goodison Park in the summer, but missed the start of the season thanks to a hamstring injury picked up in the last pre-season match against Werder Bremen.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old made his debut and impressed against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup and then became a pretty consistent figure in the side throughout September and into the start of October.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, an injury picked up against Brighton meant the midfielder's next start wasn't until the end of last month against Watford, before missing the Southampton match with another issue.</p>
      <p>All that has stunted momentum a little bit so far for Delph and meant the summer arrival has only made six Premier League starts this campaign, but he's got the chance to put that behind him in December.</p>
      <p>After initially being called up by England over this international break, the midfielder returned to Everton to focus on his return to the setup and it can't come soon enough.</p>
      <p>The former Man City man is an experienced head in the centre of the park with bags of quality and versatility, with that last point particularly relevant over a busy upcoming Christmas schedule.</p>
      <p>Able to cover in a defensive role or a box-to-box position, he should be able to guide the exciting talent of tom Davies through some of the most difficult matches the Blues will face this term.</p>
      <p>Fingers crossed he can return to his fitness record from September.</p>
