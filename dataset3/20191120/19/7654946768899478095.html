      <h1>Former Green Bay Packers tight end Colt Lyerla gets 2 years for attacking girlfriend</h1>

      <p>A former Green Bay Packers tight end has been sentenced to more than two years in prison for choking his girlfriend earlier this year, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Colt Lyerla, 27, jettisoned by the Packers in 2014 before ever playing in a regular-season game, pleaded guilty Tuesday to charges including fourth-degree assault and unlawful possession of heroin for the June 17 attack, <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/11/former-oregon-ducks-football-player-sentenced-to-2-years-for-attacking-strangling-girlfriend-in-eugene.html">The Oregonian reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Police said Lyerla — a onetime 5-star recruit out of high school who joined the University of Oregon Ducks in 2011 — choked the 24-year-old woman at her home in Eugene and fled by the time cops arrived.</p>
      <p>Lyerla was taken into custody the following day after cops used a stun gun on him. He also had heroin on him at the time, the newspaper reports.</p>

      <p>The sentence is the latest legal setback for Lyerla, who was added as a junior in 2013 to the “watch list” for the John Mackey Award, which is given annually to college football’s most outstanding tight end, <a href="https://kval.com/news/local/former-oregon-football-player-colt-lyerla-sentenced-to-prison">KVAL reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Later that season, Lyerla missed two games for unspecified violations of team rules before leaving the team in October to pursue a career in the NFL. But Lyerla was arrested in Eugene days later for snorting cocaine and pleaded guilty to cocaine possession, the station reports.</p>
      <p>Lyerla also had several other criminal convictions since that time, including for possession of heroin, cocaine and forgery, <a href="https://www.registerguard.com/news/20191119/former-oregon-ducks-football-player-sentenced-to-more-than-2-years-in-prison">the Register-Guard reports</a>.</p>
      <p>Most recently, Lyerla was busted in December at a Target in Oregon, where police said he stole about $120 of items and was found in possession of heroin when taken into custody. A judge sentenced him to four months in prison after he pleaded guilty to unlawful possession of heroin, according to The Oregonian.</p>
