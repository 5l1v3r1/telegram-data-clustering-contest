      <p>This was the moment a toddler somehow managed to trap her leg in one of the stairgates being recalled by Argos.</p>
      <p>Shann Reeves <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/firefighters-rescue-girl-2-trapped-3554499">had to call firefighters</a> after realising that her daughter Pria’s leg was stuck in a stairgate she had planned to take back to Argos - and nothing she could do would get it out.</p>
      <p>Shann had opened an email that very morning from Argos advising her that the Cuggl stairgate she bought in March was being recalled.</p>
      <p>The store recalled two of the nine in their Cuggl range, and this spring and summer undertook extensive tests on them.</p>
      <p>That resulted in a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/lidl-tesco-asda-sainsburys-recall-2020546">mass recall earlier this month</a>, and the email was opened by Shann at her home in east Bristol on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>“I realised that the recall was for the stairgate I had for Pria, and she’s just two now and has recently learned how to climb the stairs, so I was keen to get it returned and replaced,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I was getting up and getting ready to go out to the shops to do that, and I was in front of her bedroom door and she was inside, with the stairgate across the doorway.</p>

      <p>“I literally turned away to get ready for a minute and looked back and thought ‘why is she sitting so close to the stairgate?’</p>
      <p>“Then she said ‘mummy, me stuck!’ and I went to see,” she added.</p>
      <p>Somehow Pria had managed to put her foot through one gap in the bars, and then back through another gap.</p>
      <p>“She’d obviously gone through and then tried to get her foot back out, and made it worse trying to wriggle. She’d kind of weaved her leg in and out of it.</p>
      <p>“When I first saw it, I thought I’d just unweave it, but pretty quickly I realised that I was not going to be able to get her leg out without hurting her badly,” she added.</p>
      <p>So Shann dialled 999. “The lady asked if I required police, fire or ambulance, and I said ‘either fire or ambulance, whichever can get my daughter’s leg out of this gate’,” she said.</p>
      <p>Firefighters from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/kingswood">Kingswood </a>fire station arrived around 20 minutes later.</p>
      <p>“We’re on our own, so I went down to unlock the front door and came back up and just sat behind Pria, propping her up, trying to distract her a bit, and to stop her wriggling, because she kept trying to pull on it,” said Shann.</p>

      <p>“She was ok, but I think she was pretty worried, especially when her mummy couldn’t get her leg out. She realised she’d done something serious,” she added.</p>
      <p>“So we were both just sitting there staring at the front door waiting for help to arrive - it’s the worst scenario, really, having to wait for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-fire-and-rescue">the firefighters</a> with the front door open.</p>
      <p>“It was an absolute nightmare,” she added.</p>
      <p>After 20 minutes that felt like hours, four firefighters arrived.</p>
      <p>“They were great, but it took a while. They looked at what she’d done and couldn’t work out how to get her out - that was concerning,” said Shann.</p>
      <p>One of the four went to the fire appliance to get equipment. “He went off to get the spreaders they use to prise open car doors in car crashes, so that was worrying. But luckily, the other three decided to have a go pulling the bars apart.</p>

      <p>“It took all their strength and weight to pull the bars and I had to lift Pria up as the third firefighter gently manoeuvred her leg to get it free.</p>
      <p>“The bars sprung back with some force - and it’s clear why these gates have been recalled,” she said.</p>
      <p>“They were sat looking at the stairgate for a while, saying it was dangerous,” she said.</p>
      <p>Now, Shann is planning to take the stairgate back, and is urging all parents to check what they’ve got and whether it has to be recalled.</p>
      <p>Pria is recovering from her ordeal.</p>
      <p>“She’s alright, she’s got bruising on her shin where it was pressing into the bone, and around the back of knee too. We’ve had quite a few biscuits to feel better,” she laughed.</p>
      <p>With all the drama, she didn’t get to take the stairgate back, but it’s no longer in use. “Maybe I’ll keep it as a warning,” she joked.</p>
      <p>“But people really should check and taken theirs back. You don’t need the receipt, even.</p>
      <p>“Everyone should check what they’ve got against the list, and make sure they sort this out, because with this one at least, it’s easy to see how a child could get their head stuck in one, and it could be serious,” she added.</p>
      <p>An Argos spokesperson said, “We are very sorry to hear about this incident.</p>
      <p>"Product safety is our number one concern, which is why we recalled these stairgates after independent testing highlighted potential safety issues.</p>
      <p>"We urge parents and carers with one of these stairgates to stop using it immediately and return it to an Argos store for a full refund," he said.</p>

      <p>Argos says there is a risk of the following problems occurring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Brackets or wooden slats breaking under high impact</li>
        <li>Regular banging or kicking of the gate, for example the auto-close feature failing</li>
        <li>The gaps between metal bars being wider than the required standard, which could lead to a child getting trapped</li>
      </ul>
