      <p>A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Gwagwalada, Abuja has ordered that Mrs. Ann Igwe Olachi, an ex-Secretary to former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrasheed Maina, be remanded in Suleja prison, Niger State.</p>
      <p>The court also ordered that Maina, who is already in Kuje prison, Abuja in relation to his trial before a Federal High Court, Abuja on fraud charges, remained in the prison until their bail application is heard.</p>
