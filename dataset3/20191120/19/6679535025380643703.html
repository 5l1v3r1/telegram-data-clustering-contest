      <p>A delegation of KfW led by its country director Christoph Kessler held deliberations with Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney on Wednesday about a ₹1,735 crore loan which the German development bank has sanctioned for promotion of Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) in the State.</p>
      <p>According to an official release, the State has sent the ZBNF project report to the Union government with an outlay of ₹2,479 crore with a request to KfW to give the loan amounting to ₹1,735 crore and the balance ₹744 crore to be borne by the State.</p>
      <p>A high-level screening committee of the Ministry of Finance had cleared the proposal in April this year. A tripartite agreement for the loan is scheduled to be signed by the Union and the State governments and the lender (KfW) later this month.</p>
      <p>It was stated in the official communication that the financial assistance from KfW would be utilised for ZBNF involving about seven lakh farmers in 1,725 villages. About 25,000 farmers would be groomed as master trainers.</p>
      <p>ZBNF adviser T. Vijaya Kumar and KfW Project Manager Sangeeta Agarwal were present.</p>
