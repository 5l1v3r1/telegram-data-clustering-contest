      <p>MILWAUKEE - Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says he is running for a fifth term in office.</p>
      <p>Barrett made the announcement Wednesday but he has long been expected to seek another term. The Milwaukee native was a key player in the effort to bring the Democratic National Convention to the city next year.</p>
      <p>Barrett was first elected in 2004. The Democrat ran for governor twice against then-Gov. Scott Walker but was defeated in 2010 and in 2012 when Walker survived a recall election.</p>
      <p>Barrett is entering what is already a crowded field of mayoral candidates. Eight others are running, including Alderman Anthony Zielinski and state Sen. Lena Taylor.</p>
      <p>Before becoming mayor, Barrett was a state legislator and served five terms in Congress.</p>
      <p>The election is April 7 next year.</p>
