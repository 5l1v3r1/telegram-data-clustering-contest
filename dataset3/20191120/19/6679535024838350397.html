      <p>Following a decision taken by the technical committee to resolve waterlogging in Kochi under Operation Breakthrough, officials will fan out to areas in the city frequently witnessing waterlogging for a site examination on Thursday. They are to submit their report with the estimate of works to be taken up by November 26.</p>
      <p>Waterlogging-prone areas have been divided into 27 wards for ease of assessment. Each team visiting these wards will comprise an assistant engineer and an overseer. They will gather information on flooding from residents of these areas and will also record peopleâ€™s suggestions on ways to address it.</p>
      <p>A report prepared by them with details about the cause of waterlogging will be submitted to the technical committee. In all, 90 officials from 13 departments are slated to take part in the exercise.</p>
      <p>Once vetted by the technical committee, the report will be handed over to the District Disaster Management Authority for vetting. With the DDMA also granting its clearance, work will be awarded to contractors for execution between January 1 and March 31. District Collector S. Suhas has asked the officials to conduct inspection, gather suggestions and prepare their reports in a fail-safe manner in order to avert complaints over the process.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously, measures will be taken to clear the water channels of major canals in the city to ensure their smooth flow.</p>
      <p>The overall supervision of the activities is with a technical committee led by 13 executive engineers. S. Shajahan is the nodal officer.</p>
