      <h1>Kirk Cousins Flinched So Hard After Stefon Diggs Pretended To Hit Him In The Groin (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>The Minnesota Vikings are back having fun again.</p>
      <p>After coming off a huge win against the Dallas Cowboys, the team found themselves down 20-0 against the Denver Broncos last Sunday. The team ended up defying the odds and became the first team in 100 tries to win a game in which they were trailing by 20 or more at halftime.</p>
      <p>Stefon Diggs was a large part of that comeback as he ran in for a 54-yard TD early on in the 4th quarter to bring his squad within 3 points.</p>
      <p>After the scoring play, the WR got his teammates pumped by screaming, but Kirk Cousins, who was looking at a tablet, got the scare of a lifetime when Diggs pretended like he was going to hit him below the belt.</p>
      <p>Cousins has likely played that game before, but he still flinched like crazy.</p>
