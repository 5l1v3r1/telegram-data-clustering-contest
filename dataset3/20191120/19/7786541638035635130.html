      <p><b>WASHINGTONÂ (AP)</b> - Most Federal Reserve officials believed last month that the three rate cuts they made this year would be enough unless the economy weakened significantly.</p>
      <p>The minutes of the October Fed meeting reveal that "most participants" thought that this year's rate cuts would be sufficient to support moderate growth, a continued strong job market and inflation rising toward the Fed's 2% target level.</p>
      <p>A "couple" of Fed officials suggested that this view should be reinforced by additional comments after the meeting that further rate cuts were "unlikely in the near term" unless the economy slowed significantly.</p>
      <p>The consensus among economists is that the Fed will now pause after cutting rates three times in 2019, with its benchmark rate in a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.</p>
