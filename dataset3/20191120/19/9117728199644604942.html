        <b>It was largely a weekend to forget for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> in Brazil as he failed to finish after starting fifth on the grid. track engineering director Andrew Shovlin has highlighted just where the Finn went wrong.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was a rare blip for Bottas, who has finished 8th or higher in all but two races this season, to underline just how strong a job he has done this season.</p>

      <p> "<i>Before we could see smoke on television we were monitoring the oil level and we could see that we were losing oil at a relatively slow speed and a speed we thought we would reach the end of the race</i>," Shovlin told soymotor.com.</p>
      <p> “<i>When you started to see the smoke, the speed at which the oil was being consumed rose and the car turned off. This is a power unit protection mechanism</i>. </p>
