      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — FedEx says it’s investigating after a Los Angeles couple said a package flung over a fence into their yard injured their dog so badly he had to be euthanized.</p>
      <p>Keiko Napier and Mitchell Galin tell KCBS-TV that their 4-pound Yorkshire terrier, Cooper, was sunbathing in their Venice backyard Saturday when a FedEx driver tossed the package, which contained crystal and a Christmas present.</p>
      <p>Galin says the heavy package landed on the dog, leaving him in a puddle of blood.</p>
      <p>The animal had lung and liver damage and the couple chose to euthanize him.</p>
      <p>FedEx says it will investigate and take appropriate action.</p>
      <p>Napier says her grandchild and mother sometimes use the yard and the package could have struck and injured them. She wants FedEx to ban drivers from throwing packages.</p>
