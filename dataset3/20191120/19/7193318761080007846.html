      <p><b>Johnnie’s Charcoal Broiler</b> recently reopened on the NW Expressway.</p>
      <p>The store now at 6629 NW Expressway previously shared a single large space with the corporate office. It closed last year to make way for development of a new property now occupied by a Del Taco. Johnnie’s owners Rick and David Haynes reopened in a smaller space on the same property a few weeks ago.</p>

      <p>I dropped by last week for a No. 5 with onion rings in the new space, which also include a drive-through lane. Gone are the drive-in booths, but back is the private dining space for parties.</p>

      <p>Johnnie’s has also introduced a new mobile app, which offers a rewards program and cashless purchasing for pick-up orders.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we await the return of the oldest Johnnie’s Charcoal Broiler location, which continues to be held hostage by road work on West Britton Road. I ran into Rick Haynes last week, who told me that location will reopen between Dec. 9 and 15, He also confirmed he and his brother have more than a simple reopening in store for Britton Road.</p>
      <p>The sons of founder Johnnie Haynes once operated a gelato shop next door to the Britton Road location and plan to reopen those doors, too. But you <i>might</i> have to be 21 to enter.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned.</p>
