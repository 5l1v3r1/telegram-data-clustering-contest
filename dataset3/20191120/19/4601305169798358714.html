      <p>Gordon Sondland testified under oath today that yes there absolutely was a quid pro quo in the Rudy-Giuliani-led drug deal involving Javelins and the president of Ukraine, and Burisma and young Hunter Biden -- and that whatever he did, Sondland says he did it at the direction of the President of the United States.</p>
      <p>Here's what Trump tweeted.</p>

      <blockquote>...”I WANT NOTHING! I WANT NOTHING! I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO! TELL PRESIDENT ZELENSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING!” Later, Ambassador Sondland said that I told him, “Good, go tell the truth!” This Witch Hunt must end NOW. So bad for our Country!</blockquote>
