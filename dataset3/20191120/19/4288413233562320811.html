      <h1>Sigma is Working on a Canon RF Lens Roadmap for 2020: Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:20:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petapixel.com/author/dlcade/" target="_blank">DL Cade</a></address>
      <p>Canon full-frame mirrorless fans rejoice. According to the most recent reports, third party lens maker Sigma is already working on an RF-mount lens roadmap, which they will reveal in “early 2020.”</p>
      <p>The report comes to us from <a href="https://www.canonrumors.com/sigma-to-address-their-rf-mount-plans-in-early-2020-cr2/"><i>Canon Rumors</i></a>, whose sources were able to confirm that “Sigma is actively working on an RF mount lens roadmap and will announce their plans sometime in early 2020.” CR’s sources were not willing to share what lenses would appear on this roadmap, but they did say that distributors have been given an early look at the plans.</p>
      <p>This is great news for anybody who has bought into Canon’s full-frame mirrorless system—so far just the EOS R and the EOS RP—since the vast majority of RF-Mount lenses that Canon has released thus far, while excellent, are also extremely expensive. The EOS RP costs <a href="https://www.adorama.com/carp.html?kbid=67085">just $1,000</a> as of this writing, but you’ll drop <i>three times that price</i> to pick up the <a href="https://www.adorama.com/car8512ds.html?kbid=67085">Canon RF 85mm f/1.2 L USM DS</a> or the <a href="https://www.adorama.com/car28702.html?kbid=67085">Canon RF 28-70mm f/2 L USM</a>, and more than twice as much for the <a href="https://www.adorama.com/car2470.html?kbid=67085">Canon RF 24-70mm f/2.8 L IS USM</a>.</p>
      <p>If Sigma can release an RF-Mount 24-70mm f/2.8 for <a href="https://petapixel.com/2019/11/15/sigmas-24-70mm-f-2-8-art-lens-for-e-mount-is-half-the-price-of-sonys-version/">the same rock-bottom $1,100 price tag</a> as the recently announced Sony E- and Leica/Panasonic L-mount versions, Canon users would be hard-pressed to pass up those kinds of savings.</p>
