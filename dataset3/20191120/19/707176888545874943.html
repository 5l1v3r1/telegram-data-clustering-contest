      <h1>Private equity-led group to buy UK life sciences company for £3bn</h1>
      <h2>Cinven and Astorg team with Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund to buy LGC Group from KKR</h2>

      <p>The private equity groups Cinven and Astorg, and the sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, will buy the UK scientific measurement and testing company LGC Group in a deal that values it at about £3bn, people familiar with the matter said.</p>
      <p>The firms won an auction process to buy the life sciences business from current private equity owner KKR, according to the people, who asked not to be named. Rival private equity firms Blackstone, Carlyle, Advent and EQT had earlier been interested in the deal, which ended up reaching the high end of an expected price range, the people said.</p>
      <p>KKR and Cinven declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Private equity firms, fuelled by a record amount of so-called “dry powder” or funds committed to buyouts but not yet invested, are increasingly interested in the health and life sciences industries.</p>
      <p>LGC Group — which makes tools to test food and drug safety — is attractive in part because it is resilient against a potential economic downturn, and in part because it has the potential to grow further by buying other businesses and merging them with the group, the people said.</p>
      <p>LGC Group is headquartered in Teddington, west London, and has operations worldwide. It was a public body, the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, until it was privatised in 1996.</p>
      <p>London-based Cinven and Paris-based Astorg will be the latest in a series of private equity owners for LGC Group, which was owned by Bridgepoint before being taken over by KKR in 2015. KKR grew the company with a series of acquisitions.</p>
      <p>LGC is the first investment from Cinven’s seventh fund, worth €10bn and announced this summer.</p>
