      <h1>Asus is using AI to bolster the noise-cancelling mic in its latest gaming headset</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T19:17:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>One thing we generally find lacking in even the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-headset/">best gaming headsets</a> is microphone performance. We'd love a headset that truly negates the need for a standalone mic, and that seems to be what Asus is insinuating with its new <a href="https://www.asus.com/ROG-Republic-Of-Gamers/ROG-Strix-Go-2-4/">ROG Strix Go 2.4</a>, an interesting headset for a coupe of reasons.</p>
      <p>As it pertains to the microphone, noise cancelling is part of the pitch, but Asus says it's using artificial intelligence (AI) to make it better.</p>
      <p>"The algorithm draws on a massive, 50-million-record deep learning database and tens of thousands of hours of training to accurately identify and counteract up to 95% of environmental noises. The upshot of this smart technology is that everything from keyboard clatter to background human chatter is virtually eliminated—ensuring crystal-clear in-game voice communication with teammates," Asus says.</p>
      <p>If you head over to the product page and scroll down about a third of the way, you can listen to a trio of audio samples comparing passive noise cancellation, environmental noise cancellation, and AI-powered noise cancellation. The AI-based clip sounds markedly better, though we'll reserve judgement until we've had a chance to test it for ourselves.</p>

      <p>Asus also created the above video showcasing the noise cancellation technology in an extremely noise environment. It does appear to let through some breathing and other sounds that might be a bit distracting, but considering the recording was done at a busy tradeshow (Gamescom?), it's still pretty impressive.</p>
      <p>Outside of the mic, the ROG Strix Go 2.4 makes a splash as a lightweight (290 grams) headset built for gaming on the PC and on the go. It's a wireless headset with a 2.4GHz USB-C dongle, and if you happen to own a Nintendo Switch, it works with that. Same goes for smartphones, like Asus's own ROG Phone. According to Asus, it's the first headset with USB-C 2.4GHz RF technology, and as far as I'm aware, that's true. It also comes with a USB-C to USB 2.0 adapter, and can connect via a 3.5mm cable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Drivers—40mm neodymium</li>
        <li>Impedance—32 Ohm</li>
        <li>Frequency response—10-40,000Hz 3.5mm, 20-20,000Hz wireless</li>
        <li>Battery life—up to 25 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm told by Asus the ROG Strix Go 2.4 will be available in December for £159.99 (so it will arrive after the splash of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a>). I've reached out to Asus and asked if it will also launch in the US at the same time, and what the MSRP will be when/if it does. I'll update this article when I hear back.</p>
