      <p>U.S. federal prosecutors are planning to interview Andrew Favorov, an executive of the Ukrainian state-owned Naftogaz oil and gas conglomerate, as part of an investigation into the business dealings of Rudy Giuliani and two of his Soviet-born business associates.<br/><br/>A lawyer for Favorov confirmed to AP on November 19 that the dual Ukrainian-U.S. citizen is scheduled to meet voluntarily with prosecutors.<br/><br/>Favorov has since November 2018 headed the <b><a href="http://www.naftogaz.com/www/3/nakweb.nsf/0/9E0543388E67090AC225835200333287?OpenDocument&amp;Highlight=0,%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2">integrated gas division</a></b> of Naftogaz, responsible for natural-gas production, and the wholesale and retail sale of gas.<br/><br/>The lawyer, Lanny Breuer, declined to say when or where Favorov would be interviewed.<br/><br/>The Justice Department is investigating Giuliani, President Donald Trumpâ€™s personal attorney, for possible campaign-finance violations and a failure to register as a foreign agent as part of its probe.<br/><br/>Giuliani's close associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman have been indicted on charges of federal campaign-finance violations, conspiracy, making false statement, and falsification of records.<br/><br/>They and Giuliani have been involved in back-channel meetings with current and former Ukrainian officials regarding investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter, and Democratic Party activities in the 2016 presidential election.<br/><br/>In March, Parnas and Fruman approached Favorov at an energy conference in Texas to offer a partnership in a venture to export U.S. liquefied gas to Ukraine. They also discussed the possibility of Favorov replacing his ultimate superior, Naftogaz CEO Andriy Kobolyev.<br/><br/>Giuliani has denied taking part in the two suspects' efforts to seal a gas deal in Ukraine.<br/><br/>Before joining Naftogaz, Favorov was a managing partner and director of Energy Resources of Ukraine. A graduate of Georgetown University in Washington, Favorov was in 2010-14 the commercial director of the DTEK energy holding owned by billionaire Rinat Akhmetov.</p>
