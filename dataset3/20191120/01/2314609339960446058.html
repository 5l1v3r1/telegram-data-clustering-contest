      <h1>Council's civic cabinet decisions revealed to all councillors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:06:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:06</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Stone</a></address>
      <p>The internal decision-making of Brisbane City Council will be open to scrutiny, with civic cabinet meeting minutes to be released to councillors.</p>
      <p>Civic cabinet, also known as the establishment and coordination committee, is the most secretive of the council's committees, meeting every Monday with no public access.</p>

      <p>The committee is comprised of the LNP committee chairs, the lord mayor and deputy mayor.</p>
      <p>Its decisions are brought to the next week's council meeting for full voting, but until recently its meetings could not be accessed through Right to Information laws for 10 years.</p>
      <p>That changed after the state government passed the second stage of local government reforms in Parliament in October, removing a provision in the Right to Information Act 2009 exempting Brisbane City Council from document access requests.</p>
      <p>Local Government Minister Stirling Hinchliffe told the Parliament that Brisbane was the only council in Queensland to have such an exemption.</p>
      <p>With that law change in effect, at Tuesday's council meeting Cr Schrinner announced he would be releasing the meeting minutes of each previous week for all councillors to access.</p>
      <p>It is not clear whether ratepayers will also have access to the minutes.</p>
      <p>Cr Schrinner also took a swipe at the Premier, claiming in October 2017 she insisted she would not enact legislation on councils that she would not follow in state herself, except for cabinet confidentiality.</p>
      <p>"... They're quite happy to have that system in place for themselves, for a Labor state government, yet a different system at the council level," Cr Schrinner told the chamber.</p>
      <p>"But I can say we always do the right thing, and we are announcing today that following the confirmation of the minutes of establishment and coordination at the next establishment and coordination meeting on Monday, we will be releasing those cabinet minutes.</p>
      <p>"They will be put ... the electronic system that councillors have access to."</p>
      <p>Cr Schrinner said it was not a legal requirement for the council to release those meeting minutes, but he had decided to do so in the interests of transparency.</p>
      <p>"Councillors will see the cabinet minutes from within 48 hours of the minutes being adopted at the next cabinet meeting," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are the most transparent level of government, the most transparent government body in the country, so that's something we should all be proud of."</p>
