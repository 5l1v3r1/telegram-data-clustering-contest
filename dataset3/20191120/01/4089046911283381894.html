      <p>Brandi Rogers captured video of a what appeared to be an untethered dog riding on an open trailer hauled by a truck on Interstate 640.</p>
      <p>Rogers said, "I know people think, 'Oh, that's normal,' but not on the freaking interstate. That could have potentially caused a huge problem with wrecks and possibly killed someone and/or the dog."</p>
      <p>The Knoxville Police Department said, "That is definitely frowned upon and actually illegal."</p>
      <p>KPD said, according to paragraph B of Sec. 5-15, "No person shall transport any animal in an open truck without adequate psychical restraint which will prevent the animal from hanging itself."</p>
      <p>"I don't think that," the KPD spokesperson said of the video, "could be defined as adequate physical restraint."</p>
      <p>As for punishment, KPD said something like this would most likely warrant a citation, but not an arrest.</p>
