      <h1>Yemen rebels release seized S. Korean, Saudi vessels: Seoul</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:10:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Sixteen crew members, including two South Koreans, who were held when their three vessels were seized by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels at the weekend have been freed, Seoul's foreign ministry said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"The vessels and crew members that were seized and detained in Yemen have all been released," the ministry said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The ships include two South Korean vessels and one Saudi-flagged tug, it added.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the Huthis acknowledged they had seized three ships in the Red Sea a few miles off Uqban island, west of the rebel-held capital Sanaa.</p>
      <p>The incident came amid a lull in Huthi attacks on Saudi Arabia as one Riyadh official said the kingdom had established an "open channel" with the rebels in a bid to end the four-year conflict.</p>
      <p>The Huthi rebels have been fighting the government and its allies for more than four years in a war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.</p>
      <p>A year after the Huthis seized Sanaa, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their allies intervened in the conflict in support of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, tens of thousands of people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed in a conflict that has triggered what the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
