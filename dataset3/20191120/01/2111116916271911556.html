      <p>The winds have changed: just when we thought <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/olympus-rumored-to-shutter-its-camera-business-heres-why-we-think-it-wont">Olympus wasn't going anywhere</a> any time soon, the company's CEO Yasuo Takeuchi has told reporters that there could be some major changes on the way. According to a Bloomberg report, the company is planning on restructuring "in due course" – which could involve job cuts – to meet its business goals. </p>
      <p>Although Takeuchi didn't specify exactly which part of the multifaceted business would see the restructuring, he did follow it up by suggesting there is a possibility Olympus may consider selling the camera division.</p>
      <p>Every time rumors surface about Olympus shutting down its imaging arm – something that typically happens at least once a year – pundits say that the Japanese camera maker will sell that side of its business. And each time Olympus has stood firm, stating that the camera division isn't for sale.</p>
      <p>While this admission may be disappointing to many (us included), it does make sense from a business perspective. As Bloomberg points out, the imaging arm accounts for just 6% of the company's sales, with the lowest margins and lowest gains. </p>
      <p>Takeuchi said that the company will periodically reassess its portfolio in order to focus on its medical division. After all, Olympus does control 70% of the global endoscope supply.</p>
      <p>That said, selling the camera arm is still only a thought at the moment, with no firm plans in place yet.</p>
