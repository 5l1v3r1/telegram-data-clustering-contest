      <h3>Mitch Barnett and Josh King skipped Newcastle training this week.</h3>
      <p>For good reason, mind you.</p>
      <p>Barnett comes from Wingham, King from Singleton.</p>

      <p>When they saw the trail of devastation being left around parts of NSW because of bushfires, they felt compelled to do something.</p>
      <p>Barnett went into the Knights’ office to ask how they could help.</p>

      <p>King offered his support before the club put out a call to arms asking for support in supplies, non-perishable food and clothing from the local community.</p>
      <p>By Tuesday morning they had a ute full of gear, come lunch it was a van and as the midafternoon rolled around they had a trailer backing into Knights HQ to take all the supplies north.</p>
      <p>“Being from a small country town, I thought it was a good thing to do and help him unload some things,” King says.</p>

      <p>“We were inundated with items and the community was so generous.</p>
      <p>“We were meant to go up last Wednesday but we had to change it up to this Monday [a training day]. The coach was really happy to let us go.”</p>
      <p>King, Barnett and members of the Knights’ backroom staff headed north towards Port Macquarie. On the highway just before Taree was where they started to see the damage of the fires that have claimed six lives and ripped through hundreds of homes.</p>
      <p>But it was also where they saw the essence of what King terms ”Aussie mateship”.</p>
      <p>“It was completely black – nothing left really,” King explains.</p>

      <p>“Just seeing paddocks burnt out and how close some it come to some of the houses. You can’t fathom how they were able to save those houses. The fire would’ve been lapping at their doorstep.</p>
      <p>“It only got more heartbreaking when you started to meet people affected by the fires. You can just see how their world’s have been turned upside down.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t imagine coming home one day and just everything you have built for you in your life, every memory, just being destroyed. I could feel the heartbreak for them and talking to some of the people.</p>

      <p>“On the flip side, the devastation like this shows how well alive Aussie mateship is. The amount of volunteers, people dropping off food or clothes, the support from businesses or people donating rooms. The fire fighters – they’re the real heroes.</p>
      <p>“I spoke to a pub owner and she said during one of the bad nights, she let them come in and gave them a free feed and stuff like that. It really is a joint effort between everyone just trying to come together and doing whatever they can to help out these people that are so desperately in need.”</p>

      <p>Now back in training under new coach Adam O’Brien – and having made up, King is enjoying experiencing the Knights’ new-look coaching line-up.</p>
      <p>“He’s very hands on in the coaching role,” adds King. “He’s voicing his opinion a lot more in the drills of that.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got also got Dave Furner and Willie Peters. There’s a lot of experience there. It’s different opinions. For some of us young fellas who have only been here under Browny, it’s a different point of view on things. It can only be good for us to learn and develop. We’re really excited by it.”</p>
