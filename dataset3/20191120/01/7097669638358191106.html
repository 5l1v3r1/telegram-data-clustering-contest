      <p>WILMINGTON, Del. – A <a href="https://bit.ly/35h7LaP">sketch of the young girl </a>whose remains were found at a softball field in Delaware in September was released this week by authorities to help solve the mystery of her death.</p>
      <p>Smyrna Police Department investigators said they hope the facial reconstruction sketches prompt tipsters to come forward with either the girl's identity or possible suspect information.</p>
      <p>The department is working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Delaware Division of Forensic Science on the case.</p>
      <p>Police were first called to the Little Lass softball fields, which are across the road from Smyrna Middle School, at about 4:30 p.m. on Sept. 13 after a person who was walking a dog noticed the remains, Delaware Online/The News Journal previously reported.</p>
      <p>Though police released little information at the time, they now say they believe the girl, who was likely Caucasian or Hispanic, was 2 to 5 years old.</p>

      </p>
      <p>She had slightly wavy brown hair, and an "anthropological exam of her remains suggests that she suffered from chronic illness(es)," police said.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe she was dead for "several weeks or possibly longer" before she was found.</p>
      <p>The softball league that operates the fields where the remains were found said at the time that it was "deeply saddened and disturbed by this news."</p>
