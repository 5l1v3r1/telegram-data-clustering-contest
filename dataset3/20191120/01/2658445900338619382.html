      <h3> Sunny Nwankwo, Aba</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>OVER 1000 traders and shop owners at Enyimba Market under the control of Osisioma Local Government Area of Abia State have been displaced from their various shops and places of business as the state government through the Ministry of Trade and Investment began demolition of illegal shops at the popular Enyimba Market.</p>
      <p>Information gathered by our reporter has it that the shops were demolished under the supervision of a combined team of security agencies and some government officials.</p>
      <p>Our reporter also gathered that the Commissioner for Trade and Investment, Rt. Hon. Cosmos Ndukwe had given the traders in Umuahia and Aba, including those selling at Enyimba area, up till Friday November 15 midnight to vacate the place as government of the state would begin recovery of spaces illegally converted to trading within Enyimba area of Ariaria International Market and Ngwa road in Aba and Okpara Square, Cooperative area, Akanu Ibiam and Bank road in Umuahia respectively.</p>
      <p>Some traders who spoke to our reporter denied being aware of the government directives.</p>
      <p>The traders including one Mr Joseph alleged that they lost goods worth huge amount of cash, while others claimed that the attempt to take away their goods while the demolition exercise was going on in the middle of the night, failed as they were prevented from coming close to the scene by the security agents.</p>
      <p>The traders who took our reporter round the area, stated that over one thousand traders and shop owners have been displaced, adding that goods worth several millions of cash were lost in the demolition exercise.</p>

      <p>According to one Mrs. Edith, the timing of the demolition of the shops is wrong with December which is usually their peak period weeks away.</p>
      <p>“The truth is that we didn’t hear the said government announcement. The leadership of Ariaria didn’t tell us until some hours before we close for the day. When we learnt that, there is no way or any place to keep our goods. The intention was to see how we can appeal to the state government to give us time to pack our wares.”</p>
      <p>Another trader who gave his name as Kingsley said “I was at ho me when I got a phone call in the night that our shops were being pulled down. By the time I got to here, soldiers and other security agents prevented people from going to salvage some of their goods. Even those that managed to gain access were not allowed to go home with their wares.</p>
      <p>The government officials around, collected the goods from them and put into their vehicles.</p>
      <p>“All my efforts over the years have been wasted. My life is shattered. I don’t know what to do. The amount of goods I lost cannot be quantified. We have paid to both the local government and the state government stallage fees and among other official levies. We are not on the road and can never be described as street traders.</p>
      <p>“I am appealing to the state government to come to our rescue. This burden is too heavy for us.”</p>
