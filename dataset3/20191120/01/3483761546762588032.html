      <p>It's a simple solution to a common problem faced by vulnerable women - a Dignity Vending Machine which allows women to access free sanitary products to manage their period with dignity for the next 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The machine, known as a 'Pinkbox' has been installed by Share the Dignity at Soul Cafe, thanks to funding provided by the nib foundation, to assist disadvantaged women in the Hunter Region.</p>
      <p>The Pinkboxes are designed to dispense period packs every ten minutes, which allows women to access free sanitary products, including pads and tampons, to manage their period for the next 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Soul Café Manager, Matthew Ortiger, said the installation of the Pinkbox provided women who visit with one less thing to worry about in their day-to-day lives.</p>
      <p>"Every week, we provide hundreds of free meals to men and women experiencing homelessness, drug or alcohol addiction, domestic violence and other disadvantages that life may throw their way and to be able to offer more than a just a hot meal at Soul Café is so important to us," Mr Ortiger said.</p>
      <p>"The women who have visited so far have really appreciated having these sanitary items freely available, something no woman should go without no matter their circumstances," he added.</p>
      <p>The Pinkbox is one of three vending machines that have been installed in the Hunter since Share the Dignity received over $33,000 in funding support from nib foundation last year. nib foundation Executive Officer, Amy Tribe, said two other machines had been installed Cessnock High School and The Place Charlestown.</p>
      <p>"For most of us, sanitary items are something we purchase without a second thought. Yet to others, they're considered a luxury and this is simply not good enough," Ms Tribe said.</p>
      <p>"To know that some of our most vulnerable women in the Hunter are given free access to what should be a basic human right for all women through the Pinkbox initiative is fantastic and will positively impact the health, confidence and wellbeing of people who need this service," she said.</p>
      <p>Lesley Slevin, a Share the Dignity volunteer, said providing women in need with access to pads and tampons was a necessity.</p>
      <p>"[Pinkboxes] make managing their period one less thing that to worry about during what is usually a very difficult and stressful time in life," Ms Selvin said.</p>
