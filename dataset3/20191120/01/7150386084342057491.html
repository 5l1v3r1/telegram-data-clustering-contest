      <p>According to a PTI report, the chief security officer of Lufthansa alerted the CISF about a suspect passenger in the getup of a pilot.</p>
      <p>“During interrogation, Mahbubani said that he is a frequent traveller and used to impersonate as a pilot of international airlines to gain easy access during security clearance and have preferential treatment from security agencies and airlines,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (IGI Airport) Sanjay Bhatia said, as quoted by the news agency.</p>
      <p>The investigation, so far, revealed that he was not carrying anything suspicious. The 49-year-old, a frequent traveller, has independent consultancy services where he provides training. Additionally, he makes TikTok videos and was a YouTube content creator. He impersonated pilots in the past to get privileges, to upgrade his seat, police said.</p>
      <p>On his phone, there are several photos of him in different uniforms — army, pilot etc. Travel history of the man is being probed.</p>
