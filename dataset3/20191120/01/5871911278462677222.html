      <h1>Carmelo Anthony explains what Trail Blazers opportunity means to him</h1>

And the fact that the Rockets parted ways with him so quickly scared other NBA teams away from signing him, which led some to believe that would spell the end of his NBA career.</p>

      <p>We can’t wait to see Melo suit up and play his first minutes with the Blazers — as he hasn’t played in a game since Nov. 8, 2018 — and hope that he gets to finish out the season. The league and its fans deserve one more year of Melo.</p>
