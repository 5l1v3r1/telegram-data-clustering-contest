      <p>AN independent charity that advances education by developing nationally recognised qualifications for adults and young people, is to stage its second `learner awards'.</p>
      <p>Open College Network NI will host The Learning Endeavour Awards 2020 on March 23 next year.</p>
      <p>It will cover a range of categories including schools, further education and third sector learner of the year.</p>
      <p>There will also be an inspiring tutor/teacher award, and honours in areas including health and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>All applications are welcome but special consideration will be given to candidates who have overcome significant social, economic or educational barriers that were preventing them from realising their full potential.</p>
      <p>Martin Flynn, CEO of Open College Network NI, said a new learning in employment category had been added this year to recognise "the excellent work that goes into this very important segment of our providers delivery programme".</p>
      <p>"For the 2020 ceremony we will continue with the hashtag #nooneleftbehind for social media engagement, as it perfectly illustrates our commitment to ensuring that as many people as possible, irrespective of their educational attainment get an opportunity to advance their knowledge and skills in their chosen field of endeavour," Mr Flynn said.</p>
      <p>"Our event has also been timed to form an important part of the Belfast Festival of Learning (March 23-27) which will see a range of additional high profile events take place across the city."</p>
      <p>:: For more information on the awards and access to free nomination forms, visit www.ocnni.org.uk. Closing date for entries is noon on Friday November 29.</p>
