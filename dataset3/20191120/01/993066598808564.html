      <p>SCOTTISH airline Loganair is cutting its daily Derry to Manchester air-link.</p>
      <p>The announcement came less than six months after the carrier launched the new route from City of Derry Airport.</p>
      <p>Loganair said the daily service will not operate between January and May 2020. A number of flights will be available over the Easter period.</p>
      <p>The airline has blamed a slump in demand for the service.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for inconvenience to anyone who has already booked travel during this seasonal stop in the service," Loganair's commercial director Kay Ryan told the BBC.</p>
      <p>"Our forecasts indicate that bookings will be low over the post-New Year period, so we've taken the decision to take a break on the route from January 5 until May 21, with the exception of some flights at Easter."</p>
      <p>Loganair said customers who had already booked flights would be contacted and offered a full refund or a transfer to Manchester from Belfast International or Belfast City airports.</p>
