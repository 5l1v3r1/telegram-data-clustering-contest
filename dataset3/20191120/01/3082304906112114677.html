        <b>Real Madrid and Wales superstar Gareth Bale has taken a sly dig at his club after celebrating Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification with the now-famous ‘Wales, Golf, Madrid – In that order’ flag. The Dragons defeated Hungary 2-0 to seal qualification to Europe’s premier international football tournament.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ‘Wales, Golf, Madrid – In that order’ flag was introduced by the Wales fans after Bale <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/la-liga/1199230/real-madrid-superstar-gareth-bale-wales-accepts-more-excitement-national-team-club/">admitted that he is more excited to play for his country than Real Madrid</a>. “With Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feeling more comfortable.</p>
      <p>“I definitely have a bit more excitement playing for Wales. I’ve been with most of the players, especially the older ones, since we were in the Under-17s. It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>“But it still doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100% wherever I am, and that’s what I always strive to do,” Bale had said.</p>
      <p>Following the win over Hungary, the Welshman celebrated with his teammates, holding the ‘Wales, Golf, Madrid’ flag which might not have gone down well with Real Madrid fans.</p>
