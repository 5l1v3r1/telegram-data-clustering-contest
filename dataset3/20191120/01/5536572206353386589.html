      <h1>Rob Gronkowski Says He Could Return To Patriots In 2020: ‘I Still Stay Fit’ (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:45:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:45</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski teased a big announcement over the weekend that had people thinking there was a possibility he might come out of retirement and help his former team at a crucial position.</p>
      <p>Instead, Gronk posted a video on Tuesday that he explained he was hosting a party in Miami during the Super Bowl. But, he did tell ESPN he isn’t completely closing the door on a return to the NFL in the future.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t say ‘never coming back,’” Gronkowski told <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28114359/rob-gronkowski-say-never-return-not-2019">ESPN</a> on Tuesday. “I’m 30 years old. I’m young. I still stay fit, still watch the game whenever I can, still enjoy it. I’m feeling good, but you know, one year off could possibly be the case. Or maybe two years off, man.</p>
      <p>“It’s always an option in the back of my head. It’s not like I’m not staying in shape and not doing anything. I’m never stressed over it.”</p>
      <p>The Patriots might be 9-1 and coming off a hard fought victory over the Eagles, but their offense struggled yet again and it left Tom Brady visibly frustrated after the game as he cited the team’s defense as New England’s strength this season.</p>

      <p>“The defense is just tremendous, the way they’re coming together with the veteran leadership they have there, and the skill set they have,” Gronkowski told ESPN. “With the offense, they’re finding ways to make it work like they’ve always done, putting guys in the right situation to make plays. But man, they’re missing some guy who is 6-6, 260 (pounds). They’re missing that guy, for sure.”</p>
      <p>He was talking about himself.</p>
      <p>The Patriots currently rank 16th in the NFL in total yardage (359.9 per game).</p>
      <p>“Many of them say they want to see me back on the field, but I take it more deeply to the heart when they tell me they appreciate the nine years with the team and they just want to see me happy and healthy,” Gronkowski said.</p>
      <p>“I have to keep things going, that sports competitiveness going,” Gronkowski said. “I love to play backyard games, pickup games, because I still have that competition in me. That’s how I’ve been my whole life, playing sports. Also with the fun aspect, too. Even since I was a little kid — we always hustled, always played sports, but then we would always have a party after, go enjoy ourselves, because that’s what life is all about.”</p>
