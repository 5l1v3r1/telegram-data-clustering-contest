      <h3>Olivia Munn Shows Off Her Fit Body While Performing A Handstand In New Photo</h3>

      <p><i>The Rook</i> actress <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/olivia-munn/">Olivia Munn</a> looked breathtaking in a couple of new Instagram photographs, one of which shows the stunner performing a tricky handstand. Munn is not shy about flaunting her spectacularly fit body as she showed quite a bit of skin in each of the new images.</p>
      <p>In the first new picture, Munn is wearing a small pair of striped blue cotton shorts and a gray cotton tank top. She can be seen doing a handstand against a glass wall with one of her long, toned legs pointed upward into the air and the other bent at the knee.</p>
      <p>Her tiny shorts rode up substantially in this image, revealing the majority of her muscled rear end. Gravity did her fans a kindness by letting her tank top ride up and expose several inches of her tan belly.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear where Munn was at while she performed some of her tricky yoga moves, but she was photographed posing next to a lap pool.</p>
      <p>The second image shows Munn’s friend Karine Memieux doing yet another handstand while wearing a black bikini. She also appears in video footage performing a handstand in action with her legs spread apart rather than tucked together.</p>
      <p>In Munn’s final photo, she is relishing in a day of hard work alongside Memieux, per the image tag.</p>
      <p>The two stunning women smiled at the camera while sporting sunglasses. Munn is wearing large black circular-framed glasses with a brow bar, having swapped outfits from the casual blue ensemble she wore in the first photo into a flirty pink bathing suit that appears to be a one-piece. The swimsuit has a deep plunging neckline that exposes serious cleavage on Munn’s part.</p>
      <p>Munn’s long chestnut locks were hanging down in natural waves. It looks like the actress was bare-faced or at least wearing a very natural amount of makeup. Meanwhile, Memieux wore the same black bikini from the previous photo and video.</p>

      <p>Munn’s 2.4 million followers were impressed with the actress and her friend’s physicality in her latest update.</p>
      <p>“Awesome…someone has some skills…Keep it Moving!!” encouraged one fan.</p>

      <p>“A couple of gorgeous girls, looking good ladies,” said another admirer.</p>
      <p>“Nice, pretty cool, 1st picture is the Best. Stay Blessed,” complimented a user.</p>
      <p><i>Single Parents</i> star Susan Yeagley also commented on Munn’s new post with several purple heart emoji and some praise.</p>
      <p>“Cool shots!!!” said the actress.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5677802/olivia-munn-plunging-swimsuit-photos/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported Munn wore a similar bathing suit — perhaps the same one — while celebrating her friend Cara McConnell’s birthday at the beach. In that photo, she also flaunted some cleavage and accessorized with a sunhat and sunglasses.</p>
