      <h1>Alleged ‘womb raider’ gives birth while being held on murder charges</h1>

      <p>One of the women accused of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/05/16/police-pregnant-teens-baby-cut-from-womb-after-her-murder/">slaughtering a pregnant Chicago teenager</a> and ripping the baby from her womb gave birth to her own child this month, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Desiree Figueroa — who has been held on murder charges since May 16 in the death of 19-year-old Marlen Ochoa-Lopez — gave birth Nov. 1 at Stroger Hospital and was back in jail Monday, according to the Cook County sheriff’s office.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear what agency has custody of the newborn or whether Figueroa, 25, will be able to visit her infant.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the infant’s gender, and other details, could not be released, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-marlen-ochoa-lopez-chicago-baby-born-20191119-q6hupekrwfbuhkka2ap3gz66kq-story.html">The Chicago Tribune reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Figueroa and her 49-year-old mother, Clarisa Figueroa, allegedly lured Ochoa-Lopez to their home April 23 with the promise of free baby clothes.</p>
      <p>The nine-months-pregnant teen was missing for about three weeks, until her decaying body was found May 15, dumped in a garbage can behind a home on the city’s Southwest Side.</p>
      <p>The mother-daughter duo allegedly strangled Ochoa-Lopez, cut her baby out of her womb and pretended Clarisa had just given birth to the boy when they called 911 to report that he was not breathing.</p>
      <p>The baby, named Yovanny Yadiel Lopez, suffered severe brain damage during the grisly incident and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/14/baby-boy-cut-from-slain-mothers-womb-has-died/">died in June</a>.</p>
      <p>The women <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/19/womb-raiders-plead-not-guilty-to-murder-of-baby-ripped-from-pregnant-teen/">have pleaded not guilty</a> to first-degree murder charges in the deaths of Ochoa-Lopez and her baby.</p>
