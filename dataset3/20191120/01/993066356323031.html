      <p>ARLENE Foster has challenged Sinn Féin to condemn the IRA's attempts to kill her father and DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds during the Troubles.</p>
      <p>The DUP leader's remarks came amid a row about loyalist banners targeting Sinn Féin's John Finucane and his family and the SDLP's Claire Hanna.</p>
      <p>Police are examining whether the banners erected recently against the Westminster election candidates could constitute a criminal offence such as a "hate incident or hate crime".</p>
      <p>One banner targeting Mr Finucane was removed by Belfast council under police guard on Monday from a council playpark in the loyalist Tigers Bay area.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin leader Mary-Lou McDonald had urged the DUP to condemn the "sinister and dangerous campaign of threats and intimidation" against the Finucanes.</p>
      <p>SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the banners targeting Mr Finucane and Ms Hanna were "seeking to sow hatred and division" and called on the DUP to "clearly condemn this".</p>
      <p>Launching a DUP policy paper in Belfast yesterday, Mr Dodds insisted his party would have nothing to do with anything that demonised or smeared rival candidates.</p>
      <p>Mrs Foster followed those remarks with a challenge to Sinn Féin as she suggested the rival party was being selective on what it will condemn.</p>
      <p>"It is a bit rich to listen to people talking about violence and hate crimes and what have you," she said.</p>
      <p>"We need complete clarity from Sinn Féin around some of the most violent acts that took place here in Northern Ireland. What do they have to say about the attempted murder of my father for example, what do they have to say about the attempted murder of Nigel Dodds?"</p>
      <p>Mrs Foster's policeman father John Kelly was badly injured when the IRA shot him in the head at the family farm in Co Fermanagh in 1979.</p>
      <p>In 1996, a policeman was shot and injured when the IRA tried to murder Mr Dodds as he visited his seriously ill son in the Royal Children's Hospital in west Belfast.</p>
      <p>The banner row comes in two constituencies which are expected to be closely fought in the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Mr Finucane is hoping to take the North Belfast seat from Mr Dodds, while the SDLP's Ms Hanna is vying to unseat the DUP's Emma Little-Pengelly in South Belfast.</p>
      <p>On the banner issue, Mr Dodds said they have "nothing to do with our campaign" and "anything that is personally abusive or offensive, inaccurate and smearing of any candidate in any political party is to be condemned".</p>
      <p>He added: "But there's also a challenge to Sinn Fein in this election; They can't be selective here. We condemn every act of violence from every paramilitary organisation – do they do that, will they do that? Will they condemn the IRA who went into a hospital 20 years ago and shot a police officer guarding me? Do they condemn it? No, they don't.</p>
      <p>"Will they stop eulogising the violent perpetrators of the IRA – it's time they were challenged on some of this stuff and not be selective about it."</p>
      <p>Several banners have been erected in recent weeks which include offensive and false allegations.</p>
      <p>One banner off the Shankill Road in west Belfast attacks Mr Finucane and his family, including his father Pat Finucane who was murdered by loyalists in 1989.</p>
      <p>In south Belfast, a banner against Ms Hanna asks if Shankill bomber Sean Kelly would be campaigning for the Westminster candidate – a suggestion dismissed by the SDLP.</p>
      <p>It follows Sinn Féin standing aside in some constituencies including South Belfast in order to back other anti-Brexit candidates. The SDLP is likewise not running in North Belfast.</p>
