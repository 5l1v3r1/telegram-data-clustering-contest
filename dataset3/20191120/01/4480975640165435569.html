      <p>Japanese daily, the Nikkei Asian Review, carries the latest headlines, citing that the Japanese ruling coalition is considering approval for JPY 10 trillion for the extra budget.</p>

      <p>The above piece of news has virtually no impact on the USD/JPY pair, as the anti-risk Yen continues to benefit from the risk-off flows driven by the latest China-US political tensions over the Hong Kong unrest while trade uncertainty lingers in the back drop. The spot trades -0.10% near 108.40 region.</p>
