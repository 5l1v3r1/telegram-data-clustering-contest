      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/thylane-blondeau/">Thylane Blondeau</a> is sizzling in some super casual clothes in her most recent new social media share. Whether she’s all dolled up or dressed down, one thing is for sure — Blondeau always puts on a gorgeous display for fans. The model has amassed an impressive following of over 3.2 million on Instagram alone and everything that she shares with fans earns rave reviews. In the most recent photo posted to her account, Blondeau looked stunning while in Paris.</p>
      <p>In the new series of images, the model struck a pose near the window of her hotel room. In the first image in the series of two, the bombshell struck a pose, looking over her shoulder and rocking a pair of oversized black sunglasses on her face. Blondeau wore her dark locks slicked back in a low ponytail and appeared to be wearing just a hint of makeup for the shot.</p>
      <p>The stunner showed off her toned and tanned stems in a pair of tight animal-print biker shorts that hit well above her knee. She paired the look with an oversized red hoodie that draped over her slim figure perfectly. In the second image in the series, Blondeau could be seen rocking the same hoodie and biker shorts only this time she altered her pose a little and appeared to be looking out the window.</p>
