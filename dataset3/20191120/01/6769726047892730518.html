      <h1>Westpac accused of money laundering</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:30:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">AAP</a></address>
      <p>PRIME Minister Scott Morrison has demanded the major banks lift their game on money laundering and terror financing laws, saying he’s appalled by allegations levelled at Westpac.</p>
      <p>The financial intelligence watchdog has alleged Westpac broke the law 23 million times by not reporting 19.5 million international fund transfers.</p>
      <p>AUSTRAC chief executive Nicole Rose said the transactions amounted to more than $11 billion over nearly five years.</p>
      <p>Mr Morrison said the investigation showed the government’s cop on the beat was doing its job.</p>
      <p>“I’m appalled. I’m absolutely appalled,” he told reporters in Brisbane on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“They’ve just got to lift their game on this stuff.”</p>

      <p>Ms Rose said Westpac failed to pass on information about the origin of international funds transfers and keep required records.</p>
      <p>She said the bank also failed to do customer due diligence on high-risk transactions to the Philippines and Southeast Asia with potential child exploitation risks.</p>
      <p>“AUSTRAC alleges that Westpac’s oversight of its corresponding banking services was deficient, and that its oversight of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program was also deficient.”</p>
      <p>National Australia Bank last week admitted it faces a huge fine for multiple possible breaches of counter terrorism and anti-money laundering laws.</p>
      <p>Commonwealth Bank was fined a record $700 million in 2018 for serious breaches of the same laws.</p>
      <p>Mr Morrison said despite the controversies, the banks needed to continue supporting home buyers and small businesses.</p>
      <p>“All of this is not a leave pass to pull up the drawbridge in terms of the credit extension into the Australian economy,” he said.</p>
      <p>Westpac says it self-reported the failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions to AUSTRAC.</p>
      <p>“AUSTRAC was also investigating a number of other areas relating to Westpac’s processes, procedures and oversight,” the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Westpac is currently reviewing AUSTRAC’s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed.”</p>
      <p>Any penalties will be decided in court, with civil proceedings now underway.</p>
      <p>Ms Rose said the failures resulted in serious and systemic breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.</p>
      <p>“This resulted in a significant loss of intelligence to AUSTRAC and our national security and law enforcement partners,” Ms Rose said.</p>
      <p>She said business were the first line of defence to protect the financial system from criminal abuse.</p>
      <p>“This is an important reminder to all financial services businesses to be vigilant about money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing risks and understand their obligations.”</p>
