      <h1>Fury in Spain as Gareth Bale holds 'inflammatory' flag after Wales qualify</h1>
      <h2>The Real Madrid forward appeared to mock his club after holding a flag with the message "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" following his country's win over Hungary</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:53:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:53</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>The Spanish media have reacted with anger after Gareth Bale was pictured holding a flag with the words "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."</p>
      <p>Bale helped his country qualify for Euro 2020 after Wales beat Hungary 2-0 to secure their passage through to next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>After the game Bale joined in the celebrations with his team and was seen holding the flag, which mocks the La Liga giants with the claim that they are only third in Bale's list of priorities.</p>
      <p>Spanish publication <a href="https://twitter.com/MadridSports_">Madrid Sports</a> tweeted a video of the incident along with the caption: "We have always defended you, Gareth Bale.</p>
      <p>"We have had patience with your injuries, we have celebrated your goals and assists, and we have defended your passion for golf and your limited Spanish.</p>
      <p>"But enough is enough. As it says on the flag, you are laughing at Madrid."</p>

      <p>Spanish journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/rubenmartinweb">Ruben Martin</a> , meanwhile, tweeted: "He is laughing at Madrid. At their fans and his teammates. He doesn't care. He doesn't deserve to wear the shirt.</p>
      <p>"And he shouldn't wear it again. Ever."</p>
      <p>And fellow journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/Manu_Sainz/status/1196924421560246272">Manu Sainz</a> added: "Bale knows he will only be able to leave Madrid in January if he forces a move, but he is getting out of hand."</p>
      <p>Bale has only featured in six La Liga games all season, and was set to leave last summer, only for the club to deny him a move to China at the last minute.</p>

      <p>He recently admitted he prefers playing for the national team than for Madrid, saying: "It's like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday.</p>
      <p>"It's normal- with Wales, I'm speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement playing with Wales."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Bale is involved when Madrid take on Real Sociedad in La Liga on Saturday.</p>
