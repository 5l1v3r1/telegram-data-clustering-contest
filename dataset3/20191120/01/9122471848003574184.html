      <h1>CFB Playoff Chairman Asked How Tua Tagovailoa’s Injury Impacts Alabama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:27:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday night, the College Football Playoff committee released their top-25 rankings after another weekend of football.</p>
      <p>Surprise teams Baylor and Minnesota saw their undefeated seasons come to an end, but the top-seven all remained the same from last week to this week.</p>
      <p>Easily the most important story of the weekend was the injury to Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.</p>
      <p>After he suffered a dislocated hip – which will have him out for the rest of the season – the playoff committee kept Alabama at No. 5.</p>
      <p>Playoff committee chairman Rob Mullens was asked how the injury impacts Alabama moving forward.</p>
      <p>Here’s what he had to say, via <a href="https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/alabama-football/cfp-chair-rob-mullens-explains-how-the-selection-committee-views-alabama-following-tua-tagovailoas-injury/">Saturday Down South</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Our job is to evaluate the games through Week 12 and we’re aware of the injury to the quarterback late in the second quarter of last week’s game. But Alabama had a convincing win, and it didn’t impact Alabama’s ranking this week…It was certainly a part of the discussion. We’re aware of how the games unfold, and we’re aware of key injuries to players in the game. But, again, for this week we noticed that Alabama still carried on to a convincing win.”</blockquote>
      <p>Alabama needs some help heading into the final few weeks of the season, but a path into the playoff exists for the Tide.</p>
      <p>The Pac-12 title-winner could be a major problem for the Tide, though the season-finale against Auburn will factor in as well.</p>
