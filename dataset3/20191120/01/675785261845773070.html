      <h1>Mystery of Prince Andrew's lavish lifestyle on 'small pension and allowance from mum'</h1>
      <h2>The Duke of York keeps a home in Windsor and a £13million Swiss chalet in Verbier yet his primary source of income appears to be a small naval pension and a basic allowance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:38:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:38</time> by <a rel="author">Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p>He has been dubbed the “party prince” who loves the high life, but mystery surrounds how the Duke of York lives such a lavish lifestyle on an allowance from his mum.</p>
      <p>There is little evidence of him earning the money needed to support such expensive tastes and he’s never had a proper full-time paid job since he left the Royal Navy in 2001.</p>
      <p>Royal observers have often pondered how he manages to keep a home in Windsor – shared with his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson – and a £13million Swiss chalet in Verbier.</p>
      <p>It has seven bedrooms, a sauna, a pool room and a terrace – quite the pile for a man who receives a “basic” allowance of £249,000 from the Queen to fund his office at Buckingham Palace.</p>

      <p>His earnings are arguably topped up with a small naval pension of £20,000 a year.</p>
      <p>He attracted the moniker “Air Miles Andy”, indulging his penchant for private jets.</p>
      <p>He's been pictured with a special edition gold Apple watches and a new Bentley.</p>
      <p>Seen at golf courses and the resorts of St Tropez – the question remains: how does he afford it?</p>

      <p>The money given to him by the Queen comes from the Duchy of Lancaster, the estate that provides her with a private income.</p>
      <p>This year the duchy’s profits rose to £21.7million.</p>
      <p>Critics say that allowance has meant Andrew has largely relied on currying favour with the rich and the famous in return for access to royal events and accommodation.</p>

      <p>Andrew is said to have spent £7.5million doing up Royal Lodge, the house in Windsor Great Park that he and Sarah shared after their divorce.</p>
      <p>The most obvious source of income is the money he made from the sale of Sunninghill Park, which the Queen gave the couple as a wedding gift.</p>
      <p>Timur Kulibayev, son-in-law of the president of Kazakhstan, bought it for £15million in 2007.</p>
