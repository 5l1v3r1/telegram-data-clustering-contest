      <h1>De Blasio finally holds a bill signing — his first since March</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:55:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:55</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Calder and Jacob Henry</a></address>
      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday signed a dozen bills into law — his first bill signings since mid-March.</p>
      <p>De Blasio stopped pulling out his pen to sign bills after shifting his focus towards embarking on a quixotic campaign for president, which he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/20/bill-de-blasio-pulls-the-plug-on-his-sputtering-presidential-bid/">ended in September</a> after garnering minuscule support.</p>
      <p>In the interim, he’s allowed dozens of pieces of legislation to lapse into law.</p>
      <p>The new bills signed include Council Speaker Corey Johnson’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/city-council-approves-corey-johnsons-1-7b-car-reduction-plan/">$1.7 billion blueprint for reducing cars on city streets,</a> another that further tightens regulations on the horse carriage industry, and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/city-council-approves-foie-gras-ban-other-animal-rights-measures/">a ban on foie gras sales</a> beginning in 2022.</p>
      <p>Johnson’s groundbreaking transportation plan calls on the city to build 250 miles of protected bike lanes within five years, give signal priority for public transit at nearly 5,000 intersections, and create one million new square feet of space for pedestrians within two years.</p>
      <p>When asked why the mayor waited so long between bill signings, de Blasio spokeswoman Avery Cohen, “it’s not uncommon for a bill to lapse into law—it’s simply just a matter of scheduling. What matters is that the end result is the same for New Yorkers.”</p>
      <p>De Blasio’s last bill signings were March 18 and were for three pieces of legislation aimed at boosting workers in the trade waste industry.</p>
