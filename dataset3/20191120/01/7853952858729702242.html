      <p>The United States would raise tariffs on Chinese imports if no deal is reached with Beijing to end a trade war, US President Donald Trump said, threatening an escalation of the spat that has damaged economic growth worldwide.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, Trump said he has a good relationship with China, noting that China is “moving along”. However, he said China would have to make a deal “I like”.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher,” he told a room filled with senior US officials.</p>
      <p>The US and China have been locked in successive waves of tit-for-tat tariffs that have roiled financial markets and threatened to drag growth in the global economy to its lowest rate since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.</p>
      <p>Hopes were high that a partial trade deal could be signed at a summit in Santiago, Chile that was scheduled for mid-November. The summit was canceled amid unrest in Chile and a path forward for a deal remains unclear.</p>
      <p>Sticking points include how and when to reduce tariffs and how much US agricultural products China would commit to buy.</p>
      <p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week that the two countries were getting close to an agreement to end the 16-month-long trade war, but he gave no further details on the timing of a possible deal.</p>
      <p>Still, Chinese state media outlet Xinhua said “constructive talks” were held by phone on Saturday between China’s Vice Premier Liu He, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. <b><i>Reuters</i></b></p>
