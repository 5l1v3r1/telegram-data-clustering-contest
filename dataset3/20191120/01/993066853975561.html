      <p>In this Westminster election, there is no doubt that the stakes are high and the battle for a number of key seats will be especially intense.</p>
      <p>There are important issues at stake, not least the Brexit debate and the potential ramifications for the Union and the political relationships on this island.</p>
      <p>Remain supporting parties are determined that the UK's withdrawal from the EU will be the dominant issue and to that end have stood aside in certain seats in a bid to maximise the anti-Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>This strategy is in particularly sharp focus in DUP-held North Belfast and South Belfast.</p>
      <p>Sinn FÃ©in's John Finucane is attempting to unseat the DUP's deputy leader Nigel Dodds in the north of the city while the SDLP's Claire Hanna is trying to dislodge Emma Little-Pengelly in the south.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, both contests have been overshadowed by a sinister and disturbing loyalist campaign targeting Mr Finucane and Ms Hanna.</p>
      <p>Banners smearing the two candidates and which include false and offensive claims, have appeared in north and south Belfast as well as in Ballymena, Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>The police are investigating if the displays constitute any criminal offence, including a hate crime.</p>
      <p>One banner was taken down by Belfast City Council staff under police guard on Monday from fencing at a children's play park in Tigers Bay, north Belfast.</p>
      <p>Posters linking the Alliance party and the IRA have also appeared in North Down where Stephen Farry is attempting to take the seat previously held by Lady Sylvia Hermon.</p>
      <p>These intimidatory displays offer only hatred and negativity and it is essential they are roundly condemned by all democrats.</p>
      <p>The loyalists behind them are clearly trying to undermine in a most cynical manner the anti-Brexit candidates standing against the DUP which makes it incumbent on the party to reject this tactic in the most forthright terms.</p>
      <p>Yesterday Mr Dodds insisted the banners have nothing to do with his campaign and condemned the 'personally abusive or offensive, inaccurate and smearing of any candidate in any political party,' which is a welcome step.</p>
      <p>Elections are by their nature combative exercises but we need to ensure some people do not attempt to drag the campaign into vicious and threatening territory, through banners, posters or social media trolling.</p>
      <p>As we in Northern Ireland know only too well, words and messages can have dangerous consequences.</p>
