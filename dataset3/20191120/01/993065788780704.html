      <p>A BELFAST pub has been hailed the most 'dog-friendly' in the north.</p>

      <p>The awards are run by Rover.com, the world's largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers.</p>

      <p>Sunflower worker Robert McManus said: "All our staff love dogs and try to make sure their time in the pub is comfortable.</p>
      <p>"We take part in a few dog-friendly events so this shows that the work we're doing is worthwhile and local dog owners appreciate what we're doing. This regional award opens up many new opportunities for us."</p>
