      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - When a flash flood warning is issued for your area, you probably get a blaring alert on your mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Those so-called wireless emergency alerts are seen as potential life-savers. But nationally, they’ve also been the source of some frustration.</p>
      <p>The concern: The warnings are sent too frequently and to lots of people who are unlikely to be affected.</p>
      <p>In a bid to address those issues, the National Weather Service will debut its new “impact-based” flash flood warning format in Honolulu this month, changing the alerts sent to your phone.</p>
      <p>The new system, set to launch next month, is aimed at recognizing that not all flash flood warnings are the same ― and that only more severe flooding should warrant an alert on your phone.</p>
      <p>So going forward, most flash flood warnings won’t trigger a mobile phone alert.</p>
      <p>Instead, alerts will only be sent in the case of “considerable” or “catastrophic" flash flooding.</p>
      <p>A “considerable” flash flood warning will be used rarely, and only when there are indications flash flooding is capable of unusual severity or urgent action is needed to protect lives and property.</p>
      <p>A “catastrophic” flash flood warning will be used “exceedingly rarely,” and only when a flash flood threat is a threat to life and catastrophic damage is occurring or is imminent.</p>
      <p>FEMA helped contribute to the new format, noting resident complaints over wireless emergency alerts for flash flooding with perceived little impact.</p>
      <p>The National Weather Service issues more than 4,000 flash flood warning each year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the service is also seeking to including more information in its flooding warning, with a source for the information and a brief description of the potential impact.</p>
      <p>The weather service said third-party vendors, such as weather apps, will be able to identify and extract the “emergency” language in the flash flood warnings and send that information to the public.</p>
