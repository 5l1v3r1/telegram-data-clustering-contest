      <p>“It’s inconceivable to me there would be 67 votes to remove the president from office,” McConnell told reporters.</p>
      <p>Democrats in the House of Representatives are currently probing whether Trump should be removed from office. If the House determines that Trump has committed impeachable offenses, then the Senate will conduct a trial on whether to remove Trump.</p>
