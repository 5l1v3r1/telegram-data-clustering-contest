      <p>Now he needs his own lawyer.</p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors have charged an attorney with filing over 300 lawsuits under the Americans with Disabilities Act — on behalf of two clients who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/14/this-disability-lawyer-has-been-scamming-his-clients-by-filing-lawsuits-without-their-consent/">had no clue he was claiming to represent them</a>.</p>
      <p>Stuart Finkelstein is facing charges of mail fraud, aggravated identity theft, obstruction of justice, and making false declarations before a court for filing hundreds of lawsuits in the pair’s names without their consent, according to a complaint unsealed Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim Finkelstein — who collected around $930,000 from the scheme — filed the phony claims in Florida and Manhattan between 2013 and 2016 on behalf of the two unsuspecting people, who are referred to in court papers only as “Victim 1” and “Victim 2.”</p>
      <p>“Stuart Finkelstein, a practicing attorney, appeared to be advocating on his clients’ behalf by allegedly filing lawsuits claiming they were unable to access public establishments due to ADA noncompliance,” Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey Berman said in a statement. “This was false. Not only did he allegedly fabricate the underlying facts of the lawsuits – the victims never actually tried to access the establishments – Finkelstein stole their identities and didn’t even represent them as an attorney.”</p>
      <p>The 65-year-old presented in federal court in Florida on Tuesday, and is expected to appear in a Manhattan federal courtroom at a later date.</p>
      <p>Finkelstein did not immediately return a message.</p>
      <p>He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.</p>
