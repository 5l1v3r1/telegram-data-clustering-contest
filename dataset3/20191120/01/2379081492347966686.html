      <h1>Fitch affirms China's A+ rating with a stable outlook</h1>

      <p>Credit ratings agency Fitch affirmed China’s long term foreign currency rating at A+, saying it was supported by the nation’s ‘robust’ external finances and its strong macroeconomic performance.</p>
      <p>Fitch’s outlook on China is stable, it said. It added that the foreign currency ratings are primarily constrained by large structural vulnerabilities in the country’s financial sector.</p>
      <p>The ratings agency also said it forecast China’s growth to slow to 5.7% in 2020 from 6.1% in 2019.</p>
      <p>China’s macroeconomic policy has moved towards easing since mid-2018 to deal with the impact of the economy’s trade war with the United States, Fitch noted.</p>
      <p>“Recent progress towards reaching a U.S.-China “phase one” trade deal suggests the possible postponement or eventual removal of some existing tariffs, which could pose an upside risk to our growth outlook,” the ratings agency said.</p>
      <p>Fitch added that China has some room at its existing rating level to accommodate a temporary period of elevated fiscal deficits while external pressures subside.</p>
      <p>In September, S&amp;P Global also affirmed the ‘A+/A-1’ credit rating on China, stating that the country was going to maintain above-average gross domestic product growth and improved fiscal performance.
