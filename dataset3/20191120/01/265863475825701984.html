      <h1>Emily Ratajkowski Has A ‘Complicated Relationship’ With Being Sexy – Here’s Why</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T01:23:59+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 01:23</time> by <a rel="author">Rachelle Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Emily Ratajkowski has a “complicated relationship” with being sexy. The brunette beauty may ooze sexiness, but it is not an easy thing for her to embrace.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Ratajkowski stopped by the podcast<i> Pretty Big Deal</i> to chat with Ashley Graham. During their talk, Graham said, “Ratajkowski has always been known as a sexy girl.” The pregnant model then asked the actress how she felt about the label.</p>
      <p>Graham wanted to know if it made Ratajkowski feel hurt or was it more of a superpower. The <i>Entourage</i> alum then got real on a topic that is complicated for her.</p>

      <p>“Both. I think that I have a really complicated relationship to being sexy. I think that I have definitely found incredible power in it, just for myself. Like being empowered for myself. I’m not talking about power in like how much money I made or my career. I mean, like, in feeling good and powerful in my body. I’ve definitely been able to do that. I also think there’s another side of me that’s like every woman, where it’s like I’m so much more than just that,” replied the 32-year-old.</p>
      <p>Ratajkowski and Graham both admitted they know first-hand what it is like to be placed in a box because of their physical appearances. In the fashion world when a person is labeled, it is hard to break the image or move out of the box.</p>
      <p>She may have gotten her start as a <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/emily-ratajkowski-breaks-the-internet-in-revealing-inamorata-woman-swimsuit-photos-328258/">swimsuit model</a> but Ratajkowski is working hard to be taken seriously as an actress.</p>
      <p>Hollywood doesn’t always take her seriously because of the sexy label. Those who have that image in show business don’t necessarily get the hard-hitting roles. Ratajkowski wants to play characters she can sink her teeth into.</p>
      <p>However, she is doing her part to help change the perception in Hollywood by reminding the top brass, women watch movies too.</p>

      <p>“What’s so dumb is that women are 50 percent of the population and they want to spend money to see movies where they’re portrayed as three-dimensional characters,” Ratajkowski shared with <i>ES Magazine</i> during a 2016 interview.</p>
      <p>Emily Ratajkowski is considered one of the hottest and sexiest women alive. However, she has a complicated relationship with that label or rather being put in the box.</p>
      <p>The bombshell is more than just a pretty face and smoking hot body. Ratajkowski wants to prove she a talented actress too.</p>
