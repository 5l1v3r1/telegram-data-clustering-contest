      <p>A white supremacist manifesto was allegedly sent to phones of students studying late at night in a library at Syracuse University in New York, according to an email sent to students by the Department of Public Safety.</p>
      <p>The 74-page manifesto reportedly belonged to the New Zealand gunman behind the Christchurch mosque shootings earlier this year, which included neo-Nazi imagery, <a href="http://dailyorange.com/2019/11/white-supremacist-manifesto-allegedly-airdropped-students-dps-says/">The Daily Orange</a>, the university’s independent student newspaper, reported. DPS said there is no immediate danger in connection with the library incident.</p>
      <p>The manifesto was allegedly AirDropped – an Apple service that allows iPhone users to send files via Bluetooth and WiFi – to students’ cellphones in the Bird Library around 1 a.m. local time Tuesday, multiple students told the student newspaper. A link to the document was later discovered on a forum page on Greenrank.com around 10:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The incident follows Syracuse University banning all fraternity activities after a black student said members of the Alpha Chi Rho fraternity called her the N-word, <a href="https://www.insider.com/syracuse-university-cancels-fraternity-events-after-racist-report-2019-11">Insider’s Ashley Collman</a> reported.</p>
      <p>“Since Nov. 7, there have been 11 reported hate crimes around SU targeting black, Asian and Jewish people,” The Daily Orange reported. “#NotAgainSU protesters are conducting a sit-in at the Barnes Center at The Arch with a list of demands for the university.”</p>
      <p>New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo responded to the incident in a <a href="https://twitter.com/nygovcuomo/status/1196853945769091072?s=12">tweet</a>, condemning the recent “hateful acts.”</p>
      <p>“This nation faces many issues, but at the top of the list is the growing racial, ethnic and religious division that attempts to make diversity a weakness rather than a strength,” Cuomo continued. “We see it all across the nation and even across the great state of New York.”</p>
      <p>He called on the Board of Trustees to investigate the “surge of hate crimes,” adding that “this bigotry must be handled strongly, swiftly, and justly.”</p>
      <p>“Syracuse University and its leadership have failed to do that,” he said in a statement. “It is your obligation to remedy the situation immediately.”</p>
