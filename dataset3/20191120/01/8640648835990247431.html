        <b>Projecting the playoff teams in each conference, and then ranking them heading into Week 12</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Baltimore (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a pretty big jump, but they’ve been so impressive in the past four games and beat the Patriots … the Ravens are the best team in football right now.</p>
      <p>This week: at L.A. Rams (6-4). Last week’s ranking: 5.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. New England (9-1)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The offense is so completely out of sync right now that it needed a Julian Edelman TD pass to beat an injury-plagued Eagles team.</p>
      <p>This week: versus Dallas (6-4). Last week’s ranking: 1.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. San Francisco (9-1)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The proving ground starts now with Packers (off a bye), Ravens and Saints up next. Tough closing slate leaves 11-5 a distinct possibility.</p>
      <p>This week: versus Packers. Last week’s ranking: 2.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. New Orleans (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most underrated superstar in the league is Michael Thomas, who became the first WR in NFL history to post 90-plus receptions in the first 10 games.</p>
      <p>This week: versus Panthers (5-5). Last week’s ranking: 3.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Green Bay (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>This will be a family battle as Packers coach Matt LaFleur is a Kyle Shanahan disciple. The 49ers denied Packers a chance to hire Matt’s brother Mike in the offseason.</p>
      <p>This week: at San Francisco (9-1). Last week’s ranking: 4.</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Seattle (8-2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>After two wins in overtime, it was a good time for the Seahawks to have a bye. A visit to Philadelphia for a 1 p.m. start will not be easy.</p>
      <p>This week: at Eagles (5-5). Last week’s ranking: 6.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Minnesota (7-3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>That was one ugly victory over the listless Broncos, but the Vikings are sneaky good overall and could be a tough postseason out.</p>
      <p>This week: Bye. Last week’s ranking: 9.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Kansas City (7-4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Chiefs haven’t played a good game in weeks, so having a bye before the AFC West showdown with the Raiders is fortuitous.</p>
      <p>This week: Bye. Last week’s ranking: 7.</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Houston (6-4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Losing 41-7 after your bye week is about as embarrassing as it gets. A home loss to the Colts would make a path to the playoffs very narrow.</p>
      <p>This week: versus Colts (6-4), Thursday night. Last week’s ranking: 8.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Dallas (6-4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The last time Jason Garrett visited Gillette Stadium in 2011, he got conservative and watched Tom Brady drive 80 yards for winning score. Hope he learned his lesson.</p>
      <p>This week: at New England (9-1). Last week’s ranking: 10.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. Raiders (6-4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The trap game of all trap games — a young, West Coast team on a three-game winning streak playing at 10 a.m. PT on the East Coast against a losing team. Jon Gruden needs to work all his motivational magic. Knock on wood if you’re with me.</p>
      <p>This week: at Jets (3-7). Last week’s ranking: 11.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. Buffalo (7-3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Allen QB Bowl between Josh Allen and Brandon Allen could set the modern passing game back 20 years. Watch for errant footballs.</p>
      <p>This week: versus Denver (3-7). Last week’s ranking: 12.</p>
      <p><b>Dropped out: </b>None.</p>
      <p><b>Knocking on the door: </b>Colts (6-4), Rams (6-4), Eagles (5-5), Panthers (5-5), Titans (5-5).</p>
