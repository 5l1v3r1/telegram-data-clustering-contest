      <p>A BUSINESSMAN, Azeez Ogunsola, has prayed a Customary Court in  Ile-Tuntun, Ibadan to dissolve his 20-year-old union with his wife, Atinuke, whom he described as “a serial thief”. In his petition, Azeez, said that he could no longer bear the shame which his wife had consistently brought on him.</p>
      <p>According to him the humiliation by neighbours and landlords’ association as a result of his wife’s habitual stealing has overwhelmed him.</p>
      <p>“When her stealing first started, I did not take it too seriously until she graduated into a huge embarrassment for me.</p>
      <p>“Three months ago, I received several phone calls in my office on how my wife was selling neighbours’ domestic animals such as goats.</p>
      <p>“People whose goats were missing in the community traced it to her selling them in collaboration with her accomplices.</p>
      <p>“Before I knew it, the landlords’ association had ordered my entire family to leave the community or face arrest.</p>

      <p>“While I was looking for money to pay for the stolen goat, Atinuke was again embroiled in an allegation of stealing mobile phones from a mosque in the area.</p>
      <p>“She was in an argument with her partner in crime on how to collect her share before she was caught.</p>
      <p>“Besides, Atinuke usually gives me dirty slaps if I dare complain or threaten to marry another wife due to her bad attitudes.</p>
      <p>“In fact, she smashed a plate of food on my head the last time.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want her to continue to destroy my reputation, please, separate us,” Azeez begged.  However, the respondent opposed the claims and prayed the court not to put an end to her union.</p>
      <p>Atinuke who earned her living as a chemist, submitted that she truly stole neighbour’s goats.</p>
      <p>“Azeez is right with the issue of goats and I have promised to change, but I didn’t steal any mobile phone.</p>
