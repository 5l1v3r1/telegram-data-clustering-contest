      <h2>The Liverpool boss has not expressed an opinion on the forthcoming General Election</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:52:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/dan-kay/" target="_blank">Dan Kay</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp features in a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour Party</a> tweet encouraging people to register in time to vote in next month's <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a>.</p>
      <p>Britain goes to the polls on Thursday 12th December but those eligible to vote must register by 11:59pm on Tuesday 26th November.</p>
      <p>Labour this evening tweeted a reminder that there are only six days to go until registration closes and used a video clip which went viral in the aftermath of the <a href="https://championsleaguewinners2019.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Reds' Champions League final win over Spurs in June</a>.</p>
      <p>It shows the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/jurgen-klopp">German-born Reds manager</a> counting on his fingers the number of times Liverpool have lifted Europe's premier cup competition, which is six following the club's successes in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984, 2005 and 2019.</p>

      <p>Klopp has not declared support for any party in the forthcoming election but has previously indicated his politics are to the left of centre.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/undercover-liverpool-talks-texting-de-13942760">Raphael Honigstein in the German author's book, 'Klopp: Bring the Noise'</a>: “I'm on the left, of course.</p>
      <p>“More left than middle. I believe in the welfare state. I'm not privately insured.</p>
      <p>"I would never vote for a party because they promised to lower the top tax rate.</p>
      <p>"My political understanding is this: if I am doing well, I want others to do well, too.</p>
      <p>"If there's something I will never do in my life it is vote for the right.”</p>
      <p>It has been reported that more than 1.5 million individuals have applied for voter registration since the general election was called at the end of October - <b>you can apply to do here if you have not already registered <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">here</a></b></p>
