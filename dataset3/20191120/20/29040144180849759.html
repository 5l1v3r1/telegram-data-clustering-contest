      <h3>Is it worth buying an Alexa Built-In Phone?</h3>

While Amazon does not offer an Alexa-branded smartphone of their own built around Alexa, it does partner with brands like Motorola, LG, and Sony to get a collection of Amazon apps pre-installed on the devices including Amazon Shopping, Amazon Music, Audible, and Alexa of course.</p>
      <p>If you've already got some Alexa-enabled devices set up around your home, an Alexa Built-In phone would be a very smart purchase because you'll get another convenient way to access information using just your voice and</p>

      <h4>Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL</h4>
      <p>Every year, Google reliably offers a nice discount on its latest Pixel phones for Black Friday shoppers. Its a perfect excuse for thrifty consumers eager to read the reviews as they roll in and then snag the phone at a to hold off on buying the latest Pixel until you see those Black Friday prices start rolling out.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>A flawed flagship with an amazing camera.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 4 does everything the 4 XL does, which is a boon for small phone fans. However, its battery life is so bad that you may be better off negating the Black Friday discount and snagging the XL version.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Bigger is always better.</p>
      <p>It may be $100 more, but the Pixel 4 XL also has acceptable battery life. It also has a bigger display to give you more room for work and play.</p>

      <h4>Google Pixel 3 and 3 XL</h4>
      <p>Now is a great time to upgrade to a Pixel 3 or 3 XL and enjoy a pure Android experience along with the best phone cameras from 2018. These Pixels are already discounted by up to 44% with even more enticing deals potentially on the horizon.</p>
      <h4>Last year's gem</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>Still a winner in 2019.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3 is a simple, powerful phone with an excellent camera and simple software that anyone will enjoy using.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Bigger is always better.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3 XL offes the same great Pixel experience with a larger screen and battery that allows you to get more use out of your phone throughout the day.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Pixel 3a and 3a XL</h4>
      <p>The Pixel 3a was one of the more exciting phones released in 2019, offering the outstanding Pixel software experience and camera at a mid-range price. It's definitely worth keeping an eye out for deals on this phone throughout Black Friday as we're expecting to see an additonal $100 in savings here.</p>
      <h4>The smaller option</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>A more affordable Pixel.</p>
      <p>Google's intention with the Pixel 3a lineup was to deliver the same great Pixel experience at a mid-range price. It's smaller size means you get less battery life, too, so that's the major trade-off for settling for the smaller phone.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Flagship size at a mid-range price.</p>
      <p>The Pixel 3a XL is a solid phone that doesn't skimp on size or capabilities. It's flagship-sized, and most importantly has a battery that's over 20% larger than the base Pixel 3a — you'll want that extra screen space and battery longevity.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>Moto G7 Power</h4>
      <p>Motorola released three versions of the Moto G7 device this year, and the Power model is the best of the three when it comes to battery life, as it features the ability to last for three days straight before needing to be recharged thanks to its 5,000mAh battery. It's also equipped with a 6.2-inch HD+ Max Vision display, 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a microSD card slot where you can expand its memory with a microSD card up to 512GB. It runs Android 9.0 out of the box with the option to upgrade as future software becomes available.</p>
