      <p>Now, an emotional tribute is set to be held in his honour during the 20th minute of next month's game at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Spreading the word on social media, Kyle's heartbroken girlfriend Elle Jean said: "<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> vs <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Hearts</a> game on the 1st December there will be a minute's applause on the 20th minute of the game in memory of Kyle Monteith."</p>
      <p>It is understood officials from the club even reached out to Kyle's loved ones about the plans.</p>
      <p>The touching gesture comes after mourners were asked to wear red, white and blue at his funeral on November 15.</p>
      <p>Kyle's death was not treated as suspicious.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the time, Elle Jean said: "Should not be helping plan your boyfriend's funeral at 20 years of age.</p>
      <p>"Life is so f***ing cruel.</p>
      <p>"Never felt heartache like this, if only he could see how loved he really was."</p>
      <p>We told earlier how mourners <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4937709/mourners-release-balloons-pay-respects-kyle-monteith/">gathered to release balloons in Kyle's memory.</a></p>
      <p>It was reported that around 600 people congregated at Kirkton Park on November 9.</p>
      <p>As the balloons were let go the park fell silent and then fireworks lit up the sky.</p>
      <p>The crowd broke out into a lengthy applause as the display came to an end.</p>
