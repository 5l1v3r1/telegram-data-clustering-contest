      <h1>Jets RB Le’Veon Bell Has Bold Message For The NFL</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:20:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier Wednesday morning, New York Jets star running back Le’Veon Bell called out the NFL for its drug testing practices.</p>
      <p>Bell, who has been suspended by the league in the past, said he’s received five human growth hormone tests in the past 10 weeks.</p>
      <p>He made it clear he’s not happy with the league over those tests. He even went as far as to say he’s not taking another HGH test.</p>
      <p>Here’s his message for the league.</p>
      <p>“I done had 5 ‘random’ HGH blood test in 10 weeks…NFL, I’m not doing another after today, whatever y’all lookin for it obviously ain’t there &amp; I’m not about to keep allowing y’all to stick me with those dirty ass needles..find the players who really do that HGH BS &amp; get off me,” Bell said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>It’s unclear how often players are supposed to be tested, but Bell obviously thinks he’s being treated unfairly.</p>
      <p>The NFL suspended Bell for the first two games of the 2015 season – following successful appeal. He then missed the first three games of the 2016 season after he revealed he missed a drug test.</p>
      <p>Now he plans to openly avoid the HGH test, which would likely result in another suspension.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
