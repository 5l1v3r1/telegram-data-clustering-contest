      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has pledged to change rules around National Insurance so workers don’t have to pay the tax until they earn £12,500 a year.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister said his party would raise the current threshold of £8,632 to ensure ‘low tax for working people’ if it wins the general election.</p>
      <p>He let the policy slip after being pressed by an employee at a Teesside fabrication yard about whether he would help ‘people like us’, not just the rich.</p>

      <p>However, it quickly emerged that the Tories are only pledging to raise the threshold to £9,500 next year, with no timetable for the additional £3,000.</p>
      <p>The PM initially claimed bringing in the £9,500 threshold sooner would ‘help with the cost of living’ and ‘put £500 in the pocket of everybody’.</p>

      <p>However, a later press release claimed the saving would be around £100 per person with the aim of working towards savings of £465.</p>
      <p>Both figures have been disputed by the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS), who said raising the threshold to £9,500  would save workers about £85 per year and cost the government £2bn.</p>
      <p>Xiaowei Xu, a research economist with the IFS, said without knowing the proposed timescale of the increase ‘we do not know how big a policy this is’.</p>
      <p>The economic think tank said raising the threshold to £12,500 would cost £11bn</p>
      <p>Labour say the tax cut would harm public services and only save workers £1.64 a week.</p>

      <p>Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: ‘Even after 10 years of cruel cuts and despite creaking public services, the Tories still think the answer to the challenges of our time is a tax cut of £1.64 a week, with those on Universal Credit getting about 60p.</p>
      <p>‘Meanwhile independent experts have said this will cost up to £11bn, so everyone who relies on public services and social security will be wondering whether they will be paying the price.’</p>

      <p>The Prime Minister appeared caught off guard by the question from 35-year-old Claire Cartlidge, a fuel quality manager at the yard.</p>
      <p>She asked whether he was promising low taxes for all or just people like himself.</p>
      <p>He told her he meant ‘low tax for working people’.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘If you look at what we are doing and what I said in the last few days, we are going to be cutting national insurance up to £12,000. And we are going to make sure we cut business rates for small businesses, we are cutting tax for working people, by the way.’</p>
      <p>He later had to correct the figures in an interview with the BBC, revising it to a £9,500 threshold next year, with an eventual goal of £12,500 over may years.</p>
      <p>BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley said it sounded like Mr Johnson had accidentally revealed his big election tax pledge when visiting workers at the North East engineering plant.</p>
