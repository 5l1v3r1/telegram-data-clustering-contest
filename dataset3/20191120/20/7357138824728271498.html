      </p>
      <p>Wells Fargo has rolled out an integration with the RTP network, letting its business clients send real-time payments. Corporate customers can send money immediately via an application programming interface (API). The bank introduced receiving payments over the RTP network for retail and wholesale customers last year.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Consumer spending shows mixed demand as the holiday shopping season begins. Weak sales at big-box stores such as Home Depot and Kohl’s were countered by a strong showing by discount retailers Home Goods and TJ Maxx. The largest retailer in the U.S., Walmart, displayed strong foot traffic. <a href="https://www.jefferies.com/">Jefferies Group</a> analyst Randal Konik told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/retailers-give-mixed-read-on-consumer-spending-11574173235">The Wall Street Journal</a><i>,</i> “The winners keep winning and the losers keep losing.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Westpac, an Australian banking firm, was accused of going against anti-money laundering (AML) laws 23 million times. The country’s reportedly largest money-laundering abuse could nail Westpac with up to $14 million in fines (A$21 million) for every breach — a potential $322 trillion (A$423 trillion) total. Last year, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia paid a record A$700 million in fines after allowing 53,750 payments that went against similar protocols.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Recent research has suggested that 56.2 percent of U.S. small- to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) regularly experience cash shortfalls, and trade credit is a contributing factor. Younger, as well as less profitable SMBs, are hit even harder, with 65.5 percent experiencing frequent cash shortfalls.</p>
      <p>However, there are tools that can help businesses alleviate this financial strain. Immediate payment platforms, which offer cash-strapped businesses fast access to critical funding, are among these tools — and the companies that use them have many added benefits that extend well beyond the balancing of accounts.</p>
