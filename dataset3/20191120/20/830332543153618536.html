      <p>Green bean casserole has long been a staple of the Thanksgiving dinner table, but can you imagine a thousand pounds of it?</p>
      <p>Green Giant broke a Guinness World Record on Wednesday by creating a 1,009-lb. green bean casserole. The brand's previous record was 637 pounds, which was set in 2017 to mark the inauguration of the Green Giant float in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>
      <p>It took 10 chefs eight hours to prepare and cook the dish, according to a press release.</p>
      <p>The casserole will be served to 3,000 New Yorkers through Citymeals on Wheels, a local non-profit that prepares and delivers over 2 million weekend, holiday and emergency meals each year to the city's homebound elderly.</p>
      <p>Here are some facts about the record-breaking casserole:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An estimated 125,000 individual Green Giant Cut Green Beans were used;</li>
        <li>The casserole was comprised of 1,069 cans of <i>Green Giant</i> Cut Green Beans, 485 cans of mushroom soup, 65 quarts of milk and 95 pounds of French fried onions;</li>
        <li>It took a team of 10 chefs from Stella 34 Trattoria in Macy's Herald Square eight hours to prep and cook the 1,009-pound serving. The average bake time for a typical serving of green bean casserole is 25 minutes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In case you were wondering, a recent Green Giant survey showed that 68 percent of Americans said they plan to serve green bean casserole on Thanksgiving.</p>
