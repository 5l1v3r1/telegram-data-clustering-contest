      <p>Roman Kemp has been settling in to life in the I’m A Celebrity jungle, getting off to a good start after being one of just four celebs to win a place in the main camp straight away.</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ has been opening up to his fellow campmates in recent days, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/who-is-im-a-celebrity-star-roman-kemps-famous-actor-dad-and-how-is-he-best-known-11171460/">talking about his famous parents</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-roman-kemp-promises-to-do-late-godfather-george-michael-proud-11169048/">having George Michael as his godfather</a>, and how his dad Martin <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/happened-roman-kemps-dad-martin-brain-tumour-11180261/">battled back after being diagnosed with brain tumours in the 90s.</a></p>
