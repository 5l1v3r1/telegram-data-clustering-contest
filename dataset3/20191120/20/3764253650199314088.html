      <p>Aside from the building works, he is also giving funds to many humanitarian projects, some of which had gulped $250,000 (N90,375,000)</p>

      <p>According to the same media, Mane is a very humble person and was seen some time ago cleaning the toilet in a Liverpool mosque to improve the place’s hygiene condition for all worshipers.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275949-sadio-mane-liverpool-star-hailed-beautiful-gesture-viral-video.html">Mane, against all odds, was becoming a bigger revelation in football</a> despite coming from a local Senegalese community - all thanks to his stellar rise and humility.</p>
      <p>Recently, the 27-year-old star was spotted in a viral video where he was helping the bus assistants offload packs of bottled water from the national team bus.</p>

      <p>Though there was no proof to show when the video was made, Senegal's national team seemed to be going for a football match when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>One of the highlights of the video was when the Liverpool forward came down from the bus and helped offload the goods down into the dressing room as his teammates fancifully walked by.</p>
