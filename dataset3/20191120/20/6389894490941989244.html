      <p>Ten suspected members of an organised crime group were arrested in London today on suspicion of flying roughly £15.5m out of the UK to Dubai hidden in suitcases.</p>
      <p>National Crime Agency (NCA) officers, who arrested the suspects in a series of raids across the capital this morning, said they believed the group also tried to smuggle 17 migrants into the country this summer.</p>

      <p>The suspects are accused of being part of a well-orchestrated attempt to launder millions of pounds in money made through class A drugs and organised immigration crime.</p>
      <p>They are believed to have transferred the money from the UK to Dubai in a series of trips over the last three years.</p>
      <p>Estimations of travel history suggest the group transported more than £14m in 2017 and 2018 alone.</p>
      <p>Officers arrested a 41-year-old man alleged to be the head of the network at his home in Hayes.</p>
      <p>Police also recovered a quantity of cash, illegal drugs and luxury cars, including Range Rovers, Audi Q7s and BMW 5 series during raids in Hounslow, Uxbridge and Southall.</p>

      <p>“Cash is the lifeblood of organised crime groups and they need the services of money launderers,” said Chris Hill, NCA senior investigating officer.</p>
      <p>“We believe that the action we and our partners have taken will have caused permanent damage to a well-established money laundering network.”</p>
