      <h1>Ja Rule Dismissed From $100 Million Fyre Festival Lawsuit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:13:08+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/zoejohnson/" target="_blank">Zoe Johnson</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/ja-rule/">Ja Rule</a> is no longer on the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/video/2017/04/2017-fyre-festival-postponed-attendees-complain-chaos/">multi-million dollar hook for the Fyre Festival </a>debacle.</p>
      <p>In a court order filed on Nov. 7, Judge P. Kevin Castel dismissed Ja Rule and Fyre Fest’s chief marketing officer Grant Margolin from the <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/05/ja-rule-fyre-festival-sued-100-million/">$100 million lawsuits filed against them</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement given to <i><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and-management/8544191/ja-rule-fyre-festival-lawsuit-dismissed">Billboard</a></i>, Ja Rule's lawyer, Ryan Hayden Smith, described this moment as "vindication" for his client, who'd originally been dismissed from the case alongside Margolin over the summer. </p>
      <p>"In July, the Court dismissed all Fyre Festival claims against Mr. Atkins," Smith stated. "After this loss, plaintiffs’ law firm Geragos &amp; Geragos appealed that decision. Today, the Court denied their appeal. This ruling is nothing short of a total vindication of Mr. Atkins."</p>
      <p>As Ja Rule's lawyer notes, Judge Castel sided with Ja and Margolin after concluding that they could not prove that festival-goers were swayed into buying Fyre Festival tickets because of Ja Rule’s promotion of the event on April 27, 2017.</p>
      <p>While Ja Rule is legally in the clear for this matter, it likely won't be the last time he hears about his role in the festival. Ja, who caught a lot of backlash when he <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/06/ja-rule-fyre-festival-breakfast-club-interview/">defended the botched festival during an interview from <i>The Breakfast Club</i> earlier this year,</a> recently got roasted on the internet for criticizing people's reactions to <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/ja-rule-popeyes-chicken-sandwich-twitter-fyre/">Popeyes' new chicken sandwich.</a> After he tweeted a few controversial messages about the sandwich, people quickly reminded the rapper of the Fyre Festival controversy.</p>

I like Tupac because I was fucked up as a kid, going through a struggle. I like B.I.G. because homie was a stupid player. And Gucci, I can relate to him because Im from the South." - <a href="http://allhiphop.com/2010/03/22/top-5-dead-or-alive-waka-flocka/">Waka Flocka Flame</a></p>

      <p>“I would say Nas, that’s my favorite rapper. It’s tough, because [Jay Z] is one of the greatest and many can argue, but Nas is so poetic with it and I feel like his lyrics, you can write them down on paper and they will last for time. It would be like literature that we read.” - <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/common-my-mother-is-my-best-friend-44204611587">Common</a></p>
