      <p>The Delhi government defended its health scheme, the Delhi Arogya Kosh (DAK), at the Delhi High Court Wednesday, saying it is not turning people away or denying treatment to anyone on the basis of residence.</p>
      <p>“Several policy initiatives introduced by the Delhi government cater to several categories of persons, irrespective of their domicile status,” a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar was told via an affidavit.<br/>To cater to the needs of the migrant population, the bench was told the Delhi government has introduced mohalla clinics, polyclinics and schemes that facilitate the treatment for victims of road accident/acid attacks/burn injuries.</p>
      <p>Delhi government’s additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, who filed the affidavit, said, “Delhi’s residents are not provided the benefits of Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojna…” like other states and UTs.<br/>The government placed its affidavit on a PIL by Abhijit Mishra, a financial economist, alleging that DAK, was “discriminatory” as it requires citizens to be residents of the capital in order to access it.</p>
      <p>Ghose apprised the court that “Delhi is reportedly the fifth most populous city in the world… the burgeoning population has placed…strain on available resources, despite which the respondent (Delhi government’s health department) has been doing its best to… improve quality of life…”</p>
      <p>DAK is a registered society which provides financial assistance up to Rs 5 lakh to needy patients for treatment of any illness in a government hospital.</p>
