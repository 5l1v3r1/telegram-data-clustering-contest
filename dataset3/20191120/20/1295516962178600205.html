      <h1>Jesse ‘The Body’ Ventura Became Vice President in the Watchmen Universe</h1>

      <p>Even if Alan Moore wants nothing to do with HBO's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/watchmen-tv/">Watchmen</a><i> </i>series, that hasn't stopped showrunner Damon Lindelof and his team from paying tribute to their source material in a number of creative ways. And the latest example is that former wrestling superstar Jesse "The Body" Ventura at one point became Vice President alongside President Robert Redford.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/robert-redford-watchmen/">/Film</a> exclusive, the site details the history of Robert Redford's political career within the <i>Watchmen </i>universe. As Lindelof tells it, "With his popularity slipping in the middle of the country and under incredible pressure from the right and the Independents who elected (and re-elected and re-elected) him, Redford appointed Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura to the Vice Presidency."</p>

      <p>"Despite rumors that Ventura had leveraged the Administration with evidence about the government’s involvement in 11/2, the gambit paid off and Redford/Ventura eked out a victory in 2012," Lindelof continued. "Unfortunately, V.P. Ventura passed away two weeks after the election (under mysterious circumstances to say the least), forcing yet another appointment."</p>
      <p>Ventura, of course, didn't simply stay a wrestler in the real world, either. In 1991, he was elected mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minnesota. Four years later, he became the state's governor as a third-party candidate.</p>
      <p>The entire "look back" at history is pretty entertaining and interesting, detailing a different timeline involving The Sundance Labs spearheading numerous colleges for the arts, <a href="https://screenrant.com/martin-scorsese-joker-cinema-comments-update/amp/">Martin Scorsese</a> overseeing the National Film Foundation, and author John Grisham being appointed to the Supreme Court.</p>
