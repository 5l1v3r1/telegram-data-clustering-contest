      <p>Burnley supporters were reported for alleged hate crimes at football matches more often than any other club in England or Wales over the past two completed seasons, ­according to Home Office data.</p>
      <p>There were 17 instances where the Premier League club were reported, while Manchester United, Sunderland and West Ham United were the subject of 13 reports each, a request under the Freedom of ­Information Act revealed.</p>
      <p>Fifteen of the 17 reports concerning Burnley related to discrimination on the grounds of race, while two related to sexual orientation. </p>
      <p>However, the club believe their self-policing approach might ­account for the proliferation of the reports.</p>
      <p>“Burnley is aware of the figure highlighted in the data and believes the number of instances reported reflects the club’s proactive stance on such issues,” a statement read. </p>
      <p>“As a club we operate a zero-tolerance policy towards any form of discrimination at Turf Moor and among our supporters at away matches.</p>
      <p>“We actively encourage our supporters to report any relevant incidents, including those suspected from our own fans, which we believe is reflected by the number of reports made.”</p>
