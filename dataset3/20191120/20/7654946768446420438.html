      <h1>Bloods gang member connected to two killings just one block apart</h1>

      <p>The reputed gang banger wanted in connection to an August slaying in the Bronx is now being sought over a fatal weekend shooting –– and both attacks took place a block away from each other, police said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Dane Richardson, 36, is allegedly responsible for the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/2-brothers-shot-1-fatally-near-public-housing-in-the-bronx-cops/">slaying of 19-year-old Stephon Brown,</a> who was fatally shot Sunday night outside of the Soundview Houses on Randall Avenue in the Bronx –– although motives for the shooting are still unclear, according to police.</p>
      <p>Investigators are also looking into Richardson’s connection to the Aug. 18 <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/16/police-on-hunt-for-gang-member-suspected-in-bronx-shooting/">killing of 26-year-old Nestor Ventura,</a> who was shot multiple times in the chest –– <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/18/26-year-old-man-shot-to-death-in-the-bronx-cops/">just a block away</a> from where Brown was shot over the weekend in Clason Point, police said.</p>
      <p>It is uncertain if Ventura, a known drug-dealer, was intentionally targeted by Richardson, who police say is a major drug-dealer in the area, police sources said.</p>
      <p>Richardson, a member of the Bloods gang, has at least 10 arrests dating back to 1997 and is known to spend his time around the Soundview Houses and in the city of Richmond, Virginia, sources have said.</p>
      <p>He is the only suspect at this time, according to police.</p>
