      <p>If you recall, a student of the school was in the news yesterday for fixing eye lashes to school.</p>

      <p>Alibaba in his reaction then wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Alibaba wrote “happy Mother’s Day… slay queen… from queens’ college. Not Queens’ College ooo. Because there are rules. (Let me come use this video to weed out some senseless people from my timeline)”</blockquote>
