Corrie sat Coronation Street star Andy Whyment and former EastEnders actor Cliff Parisi have been spotted in Oz. They were papped clutching a koala and posing next to a kangaroo. Unless they are new soap star colleagues? You can't tell these days.</li>

Anyway, the duo came to blows after he (along with the entire nation) was baffled by her luxury item being Jane McDonald. It doesn’t matter how much inspiration the woman brings her or how much it reminds her of her loyal listeners, sorry Adele, as lovely as you are, it’s JUST WEIRD. But we like weird, so we’re with you, A. Can’t help feeling it’s a joke gone wrong. Or maybe she’s stashed some chilli sauce sachets in the back of the frame. After a tense back-and-forth, Roman said: “It's just random, mate.” An irritated Adele finally told him: “That's prejudice! I'm allowed to like what I want.” Realising he had made her angry,  Roman apologised, saying: “I wasn't saying that at all. I'm sorry – I didn't mean to.” Adele then said: “It's like you're saying, 'Why would I like Jane McDonald?' “I'm not allowed to like what I want?” I like Dec but I wouldn’t take a picture of him into a jungle as a luxury item. That would be ridiculous. I’d take Ant instead.</li>

OK. We can live with that. But – it gets worse. Apparently in her book The Joy Of Big Knickers she said she KEEPS A SPREADSHEET to keep track of her bedroom action. Lord. She also once took on a 14-day sex challenge. The 52-year-old said: ”When you've been in a relationship for a long time, the physical side of things can be very unspontaneous.” Apparently the best way to track any form of sexy spontaneity is through a Word document. Or pie-nis chart?</li>

He lovingly wrote on social media: “Just voted for my boy to eat Kangaroo B***ocks… That’ll show him!” Makes a change from all the showbiz b***ocks he must have consumed.</li>

Ant hummed: “Rise and Shine” as he walked in. Apparently, this harked back to Caitlyn’s daughter’s viral song. Although no one noticed the hilarity, which was clearly lost on an OAP like me. Least not Caitlyn. Did she not notice – or did the Cait get her tongue? Ant and Dec retweeted this brilliant pic…</li>
