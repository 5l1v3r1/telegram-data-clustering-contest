      <h1>Spain court orders Ryanair to cancel cabin bag fee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:41:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p> A Spanish court has ordered Ryanair to refund a customer who was charged for taking a carry-on bag without a special ticket, and told the airline to remove the clause from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>In a ruling issued last month but only published Wednesday, the Commercial Court said the budget carrier must repay the 20-euro ($22) fee plus interest it had imposed on a female passenger flying from Madrid to Brussels for taking a small suitcase of up to 10 kilos (22 lbs).</p>
      <p>Ryanair only allows small bags into the cabin if they can be stowed under the seat in front, but larger bags of up to 10 kilos require a luggage fee, or a fee-paying priority boarding pass.</p>
      <p>In its ruling, which cannot be appealed, the court described the airline's cabin baggage policy as "abusive" in respect to the customer's legal rights under Spanish law.</p>
      <p>It declared Ryanair's cabin baggage policy to be null and void and ordered the airline "to remove it" from its terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>There was no immediate response from the Dublin-based airline.</p>
      <p>In February, Italy's antitrust authority fined Ryanair three million euros and Hungary's Wizzair one million euros over their cabin baggage policy on grounds it was tantamount to raising ticket prices in a "non-transparent" manner.</p>
      <p>But last month, an Italian court cancelled the fines following an appeal by the two airlines.</p>
