      <h1>Capital may get respite from ‘severe’ pollution on Saturday</h1>
      <h2>Average level of PM 2.5 was 2.5 times the safe limit on Wednesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:34:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:34</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The air quality of Delhi slipped to “very poor” category on Wednesday and the pollution is likely to increase on Thursday and reach “severe” category on Friday, according to government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).</p>
      <p>The city is expected to receive a respite from severe pollution on Saturday due to a passing western disturbance.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the average level of PM 2.5 — deadly respirable particles, which is a chief pollutant — was 2.5 times (155.1 ug/m3) the safe limit (60ug/m3) as per Indian standards, in Delhi and NCR at 6 p.m., according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). But the level is more than six times the safe limit (25 ug/m3) set by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>
      <h3>Advisory to public</h3>
      <p>People are advised to avoid all outdoor physical activity and keep medicine handy if they suffer from asthma and close windows of rooms.</p>
      <p>“Stop outdoor activity at early morning and after sunset. Avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. Go for a short walk instead of a jog and take more breaks. Stop any activity level if you experience any unusual coughing, chest discomfort, wheezing, breathing difficulty or fatigue,” an advisory issued by SAFAR said.</p>
      <p>Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Wednesday was 301 (very poor) up from Tuesday’s 242, according to the 4 p.m. bulletin by the CPCB, which is the average of the last 24 hours.</p>
      <p>The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to Delhi’s pollution was 14% on Wednesday and is expected to fall to 7% on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The air quality will further deteriorate by Thursday towards higher end of very poor and may touch severe in some parts of Delhi by November 22,” SAFAR said.</p>
