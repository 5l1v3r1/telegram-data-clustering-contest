      <h1>Family calls for lessons to be learnt after prisoner found dead in HMP Bristol cell</h1>
      <h2>“All we can hope now is that lessons are learned and no other family has to go through what we have.”</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:19:30+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author">Heather Pickstock</a></address>
      <p>The family of a man who was found dead in his Bristol prison cell are calling for lessons to be learned.</p>
      <p>Shaun Dewey, 30, from Redditch was found in his cell at HMP Bristol on April 13, 2018.</p>
      <p>He had been at the prison since January 4 and was on remand charged with the murder of Andrew Owen.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/prisoner-found-dead-cell-failed-3553822">A three week inquest at Avon Coroners Court heard</a> how Shaun, who had self-harmed when on remand at another prison, had suffered with anxiety and depression during his time in prison.</p>
      <p>He would often self-segregate and only come out of his cell to collect meals.</p>
      <p>An assessment, care in custody and teamwork assessment (ACCT) was carried out when Shaun arrived at Bristol.</p>
      <p>But Shaun, who was transferred to the vulnerable persons unit during his stay at HMP Bristol, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/man-found-dead-bristol-jail-3550121">was deemed as ‘low risk’ and the ACCT was closed.</a></p>
      <p>A jury reached a conclusion of suicide and ruled that although there were prison, healthcare and mental healthcare systems in place to safeguard Shaun, they were insufficiently applied to prevent his death.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner for Avon Maria Voisin will now issue a Prevention of Future Deaths report calling on the Government to consider the higher risk of suicide among prisoners on remand, who are held in prison alongside convicted prisoners while awaiting their trial, and whether national guidance needs to be changed to reflect this.</p>
      <p>Shaun’s family are also calling for lessons to be learned to prevent future deaths in custody.</p>
      <p>Oliver Carter, the public law and human rights expert at Irwin Mitchell representing Shaun’s family, said after the hearing: “Shaun’s family have had significant concerns about his death and while nothing can make up for what has happened we are pleased that the inquest has thoroughly investigated the circumstances leading up to his death.</p>
      <p>"It is clear that the ACCT self-harm and suicide monitoring for Shaun should not have been closed in February 2018, and the jury also found that there were sufficient signs to warrant the opening of another ACCT before his death.</p>

      <p>“It is now vital that HMP Bristol and the Prison Service ensure lessons are learned so that the issues seen in this case are not repeated in the future.”</p>
      <p>Shaun's family said after the inquest: “We have waited more than a year for answers about what led to Shaun’s death and this inquest has been an incredibly difficult time for the entire family.</p>
      <p>“Shaun was a much loved fiancé, father, son and brother, and we all miss him terribly.</p>
      <p>“Shaun had never been in prison before and was struggling to manage his depression and anxiety, as well as fearing for his own safety and that of his family.</p>
      <p>“We were just trying to get him through to his trial, where he would have argued that he acted in defence of himself and his family.</p>
      <p>“Tragically, he could not hold on that long, and saw taking his own life as his only option.</p>
      <p>"Prisons have a duty of care in relation to the safety of those under their supervision and we were shocked to see the range of issues which Shaun faced.</p>

      <p>“All we can hope now is that lessons are learned and no other family has to go through what we have.”</p>
      <p> A spokesperson from the charity INQUEST said: “Prisons are harmful environments and distress is further heightened for those with experiences of mental ill-health.</p>
      <p>“There were clear warning signs about Shaun's deteriorating mental health, yet the prison neglected him when he was most in need of care.</p>
      <p>“The dangerous practices exposed at the inquest must be acted on to prevent future deaths.”</p>
      <p>A Prison Service spokesman said: "It is a tragedy whenever anyone takes their own life in prison and our thoughts remain with Mr Dewey’s family and friends.</p>
      <p>“Since his death, HMP Bristol has put in place better training for staff to help them identify, monitor and support vulnerable offenders."</p>
