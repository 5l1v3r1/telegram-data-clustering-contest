      <p><b>Pete Davidson</b> and <b>Kaia Gerber</b>’s friends are not worried about their relationship is moving too fast, despite a made-up tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can debunk the story. It’s simply not accurate.</p>
      <p><i><b>Life &amp; Style</b></i> has a piece this week alleging Gerber’s friends “fear” she “may elope” with the <i>Saturday Night Live</i> star. The couple is believed to have been dating for just a few weeks now, but they haven’t officially confirmed the romance. According to what the tabloid calls an “insider,” “Pete’s saying he’s never felt like this about anyone before. He thinks Kaia’s ‘the one.’”</p>
      <p>The unnamed tipster somehow has insight into how Gerber’s friends feel as well, adding, “Her friends are scared they may elope. They’re practically shacking up already and they’ve been dating for less than three months.” However, as <b>Gossip Cop</b> noted in a previous article about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/pete-davidson-kaia-gerber-relationship-dating-truth/">Davidson and Gerber’s relationship</a>, they’ve been friends for months but their relationship didn’t turn romantic until very recently.</p>
      <p>The publication then rehashes the <i>SNL</i> star’s history with Ariana Grande, whom he was briefly engaged to in 2018, and quotes the anonymous insider as saying, “Kaia’s still young and naive. She’s been warned that Pete could be bad news, but Kaia thinks with her heart and not her head, and won’t listen.” The tabloid also asserts that because of Davidson’s “history of suicidal thoughts and drug abuse, [Gerber’s mother] Cindy Crawford wasn’t thrilled” that her daughter was wearing a “P” charm on a necklace recently. Speculation has run rampant that the “P” was for Pete, but, like the rest of this story, it’s speculative at best.</p>
      <p>Regardless, there’s no evidence the couple is “moving too fast,” as the magazine’s headline reads. They have been spotted multiple times together, but there’s nothing to indicate they’re “shacking up.” <b>Gossip Cop</b> reached out to a spokesperson for Gerber – not an anonymous “insider” like the tabloid – who tells us on the record that the couple isn’t planning to elope, nor are the model’s friends worried about her relationship. Nothing in the story is remotely factual.</p>
      <p>The tabloids have been salivating over this potential goldmine of make-believe stories about the couple. This is exactly the type of story the gossip media dreams about. RadarOnline, a sister publication of <i>Life &amp; Style</i>, immediately jumped on the topic before anything was really known about the couple. The blog posted a story claiming Davidson and Gerber’s relationship was Crawford’s “worst nightmare.”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> pumped the brakes on that story, since as we mentioned above, it was too early to call Davidson and Gerber a couple. That seems to have happened over the past month, which we noted was a good possibility. Still, the blog jumped in the deep end with both feet by inventing a story involving Gerber’s famous mom. Another tabloid is now pretending to know how the model’s friends feel, but the report is similarly fabricated.</p>
