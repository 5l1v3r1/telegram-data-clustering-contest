        <b>A Clare man has been charged with endangering the life of a Limerick-based Garda in the early hours of Tuesday morning.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He has been remanded in custody after facing seven other charges.</p>
      <p>The charges arise out of an alleged incident in which a Garda patrol vehicle was rammed during the pursuit of another car, leaving two Gardaí hospitalised with non-life threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>23-year-old Evan Toomey - of Oak Park, Watery Road in Ennis - was charged with criminal damage to endanger the life of a Garda; criminal damage to a barrier of a toll plaza; criminal damage to a Garda patrol jeep; dangerous driving, and possession of a quantity of cannabis herb and heroin for sale or supply.</p>
      <p>24-year-old Karl Haugh - with an address at Oakwood Drive in Ennis - also appeared in court in connection with the same incident.</p>
      <p>He was charged with possession of cannabis herb and heroin for sale or supply, and with possession of a knife.</p>
      <p>Mr Haugh was remanded on bail to next February.</p>
      <p>Mr Toomey will appear in court again next Friday for a bail application.</p>
