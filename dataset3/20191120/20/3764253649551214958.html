      <p>Igbos in the UK have created a hub to keep celebrating their culture and ensuring that it is passed on from generations to generations even though they are far from home.</p>
      <p>It is in this vein that the Igbo community created a group called Igbo Community in Liverpool which was founded in 1935.</p>
      <p>In a video interview with the BBC, the head of the community, Chief Angus Chukwuemeka, said when they get together, it is like home from home as they eat the food peculiar to the culture, dance to their music, and dress in Igbo attire.</p>

      <p>One of the food items that is served to visitors to remind them of home is the snack unique to the Nigerian culture called buns.</p>
      <p><i>“I am very excited about what is happening tonight. We’re bringing all the Igbos together: men, women, children, young people. That’s the key, so that we work together in the interest of the community,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Chief Chukwuemeka also mentioned how they will be using their coming together to talk about the community’s centre that has been in great disuse.</p>
      <p>He added that the centre, which was acquired in 1988, is very much important to them because it serves as a point that brings the whole Igbos together.</p>
      <p>The chief of the community said that when the centre was still used, it served as a place where they club and perform other social activities to promote communality.</p>
      <p>According to the head of the Igbo group in Liverpool, they are working towards stirring everybody interested in reviving the building.</p>

        <i>“As Igbos, we have our own separate culture which is very unique and personal, and important to us. Even our kids who are born here, they have two cultures: the English culture and the traditional Igbo culture.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“So when we come together like this, it helps them to understand. It’s also good for them to identify who they are, and identify with their people….,” </i>she said</p>
