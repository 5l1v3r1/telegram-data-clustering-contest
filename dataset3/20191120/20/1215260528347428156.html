        <b>The Preemie Foundation of Jamaica in collaboration with Friendly Lodge 239 handed over JA$500,000 worth of medical equipment to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Victoria Jubilee Hospital this afternoon.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Founder, Serika Sterling, gave birth to premature triplets in 2017, two of whom did not survive.</p>
      <p>She said in addition to raising awareness and providing support to the mothers of premature babies, the foundation finds it important to donate to the institutions providing care.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of mothers that I met while I was pregnant and in the hospital who lost premature children and not because they could not have been saved - it’s just that the hospital was not equipped,” she said.</p>
      <p>In expressing thanks to the donors, consultant paediatrician, Dr Samantha Walker, noted that 15 to 20 percent of the 8,000 babies born in Jamaica each year are premature.</p>
      <p>“Were actually getting equipment that we don’t have available in other parts of the island,” Walker said.</p>
      <p>Among the items donated were bubble cap circuits, nasal tubing, infant nasal prongs and infant bonnet interface.  </p>
      <p>Both donors expressed intent to continue the partnership that will see the unit being upgraded to a level three facility.</p>
