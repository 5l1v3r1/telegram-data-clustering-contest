      <h1>High Court rules marriage between trans man and woman invalid by as both were legally female during ceremony</h1>

      <p>A High Court judge has ruled that a marriage between a woman and a trans man was void because both parties were legally female during the ceremony.</p>
      <p>The couple, whose identities remain unknown but who are referred to in court documents as <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/two-lesbians-attacked-bus-will-homophobes-learn-arent-playthings/">AP and JP, were married on Valentine’s Day in 2009. </a></p>
      <p>In 1990, AP, then aged 34, underwent gender reassignment surgery<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/18/transgender-people-agree-using-terms-men-women-afraid-speak/"> transitioning from female to male</a>. Prior to their marriage in 2009, AP had lived as a man for nearly 19 years.</p>
      <p>However, he had neither obtained a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC) nor had he updated his birth certificate.</p>
      <p>As a result, the ceremony has been declared invalid, rendering the couple “distressed”. This was because at the time of their marriage, under English law, same-sex marriage was not recognised. </p>
      <p>Now, lawyers are warning that the case has “potential implications” for other couples “falling within the same background circumstances”. </p>
      <p>The issue came to a head in 2018 after AP contacted the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) raising queries about his pension entitlement. However, he was advised that his marital status could not be recognised. </p>
      <p>Despite the DWP being sent a doctor’s letter from 1990 confirming that AP had "now had surgery and other treatment for gender reassignment", he was still considered female in the eyes of the law and was so at the time he purported to enter into marriage with JP. </p>
      <p>AP understood the advice from the DWP to be that if he wished the marriage to be recognised as lawful, he would have to either obtain a declaration of validity or he would need to 're-marry' her, but legally as a man.</p>
      <p>As a result, he applied to the court to have the 2009 marriage declared lawful: "… so that I can continue to remain married to my wife. I do not wish to have my marriage declared void. This would be emotionally very distressing for us both".</p>
      <p>However, their case, which was heard before the family division of the High Court, was dismissed by Mr Justice Cobb. </p>
      <p>“I am conscious that this outcome will be very distressing to AP and JP,” he said in a written judgement.</p>
      <p>However, he said that in the absence of a GRC, under domestic law, AP's legal sex “is and always has been female”. “As such, domestic law regards the marriage entered into by AP and JP in 2009 as having been contracted by two legal women.</p>
      <p>“At the relevant time, a marriage between two persons of the same sex was void at its inception and the Court does not have the power to make the declaration sought…”</p>
      <p>Siddique Patel, Solicitor at Shoosmiths LLP, said that the case has “potential implications for other couples falling within the same background circumstances”. </p>
      <p>“In legal terms, such couples may be regarded as unmarried, the implications of which may be practical as well as financial, affecting taxation, inheritance and pension rights, as well as removing the potential to bring financial claims should the relationship break down. </p>
      <p>“The judge has raised the potential argument that the law may be incompatible with Article 8 European Convention on Human Rights, namely the right to respect for private and family life, meaning the court may issue a declaration of incompatibility. Parliament would then be required to decide if and how to respond.”</p>
      <p>Simon Blain, partner at Forsters LLP, added that the case deals with "an unusual and possibly unique set of circumstances".</p>
      <p>"Despite having undergone gender reassignment surgery and living as a woman, the court found that her failure to obtain a GRC meant that at the time of the marriage she was still legally male. As same-sex marriage was not legal at the time, the court found the marriage to be a nullity (there had never been a legal marriage).</p>
      <p>This is a very sad outcome for this couple who believed they had been legally married for the last 10 years. It is one of several recent examples of the law failing to keep pace with the speed of societal change. As increasing numbers of people question traditional concepts of gender the legal framework put in place by the Gender Recognition Act 2004 appears outdated and unfair.</p>
      <p>"The courts only interpret the law and it is time for politicians to grapple with questions of gender and identity and to provide a legal framework that allows people to live the lives they choose for themselves."</p>
