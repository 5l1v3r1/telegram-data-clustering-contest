      <p><b>Hyundai’s i30 N hot hatch</b> is set to get a <b>power bump</b> and a high-performance <b>eight-speed automatic</b> before this generation bows out.</p>
      <p>A senior executive at the company has also confirmed the <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/hyundai-i30-n/">Hyundai i30 N</a> has been so successful that it is already working on the <b>next generation</b>.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the current Hyundai i30 N has about three years left to run.</p>
      <p>The option of an eight-speed automatic was originally due late this year or early 2020, but now it appears to have been delayed even further, until 2021.</p>
      <p>Albert Biermann, former head of BMW M, who is the head of research and development for <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/hyundai/">Hyundai</a> and its performance N division, told <i>CarAdvice</i> at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show overnight: “It’s coming next year. Australia may be early 2021, but we are working on an eight-speed wet dual-clutch transmission that goes in that car.”</p>
      <p>When asked if Australia would get the lightweight limited edition of the Hyundai i30 N offered overseas, Mr Biermann said: “We did a special edition only for Germany and the UK, I don’t know if that goes to Australia, maybe not”.</p>

      <p>However, Mr Biermann said the eight-speed auto will transform the performance of the i30 N to a whole new level when the facelifted model (pictured above in disguise) arrives, due some time in 2020.</p>
      <p>“When the eight-speed wet double-clutch comes, we will crank a little bit more power out of it,” he said. “When we add the double-clutch transmission that will have a strong impact on the i30 N, because it is not a normal automatic transmission, this is something really special.”</p>
      <p>When asked about any further chassis improvements – beyond what was introduced on the i30 N Fastback and what is coming on the updated i30 N hatchback later this year – Mr Biermann said: “I don’t think there is a need to do anything to the chassis”.</p>

      <p>The good news for Hyundai i30 N fans – or anyone saving for one – is that the model will continue into the next generation due in about 2023.</p>
      <p>“Of course there will be a next (generation) i30 N,” said Mr Biermann. “I cannot tell you when and what it will be, but of course we are working on it (and) on concepts already.”</p>
      <p>The executive hinted that the next generation Hyundai i30 N could have hybrid power or some kind of electric assistance.</p>
      <p>“You heard a lot about electrification (in the press conference) and if you see what’s going on with electric cars – almost race cars – you can expect a lot of interesting things to come,” said Mr Biermann.</p>
      <p>When asked specifically about a hybrid version of the next Hyundai i30 N, Mr Biermann said: “We have all kinds of concepts, and as you know we have everything available at Hyundai: mild hybrid, hybrid, plug-in, battery, fuel cell, so we will figure out something.”</p>
