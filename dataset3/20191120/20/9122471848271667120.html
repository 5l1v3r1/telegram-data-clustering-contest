      <h1>Report: Florida State Has Interest In Brian Kelly</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:41:47+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>We still don’t have a great indication of where the Florida State football coaching search is heading. Bob Stoops was the first big name floated for the job, <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/florida-state-coaching-search-bob-stoops-james-franklin-mike-norvell-matt-campbell">but that has been shot down</a>, and as fun as the <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/deion-sanders-florida-state-coaching-search-candidate-willie-taggart-fired-bob-stoops">Deion Sanders speculation</a> was, it doesn’t seem to have legs either. Florida State wants to make a big splash after the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/willie-taggart-fired-official">failed Willie Taggart tenure</a>, and a new name connected to the job would certainly do that: <a href="https://thespun.com/acc/florida-state/florida-state-candidates-head-coach-hire-search">Notre Dame’s Brian Kelly</a>.</p>
      <p>Kelly has been at Notre Dame since 2010, and has pretty clearly been the team’s best head coach since Lou Holtz, who stepped away in 1996. While he hasn’t captured a national title, the Fighting Irish played for one in the 2012 BCS National Championship, and made last year’s College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t be crazy for Kelly to want a change of scenery after a decade in South Bend. He’s been floated as a potential NFL candidate in the past, but if he wants to stay in college, Florida State could present a better opportunity to win a national title. The Seminoles did so under Jimbo Fisher in 2013-14, winning the final BCS title game, and played in the College Football Playoff the following year.</p>
      <p>Bud Elliott and Ingram Smith of <a href="https://www.tomahawknation.com/florida-state-football-fsu-noles/2019/11/19/20973400/nolecast-talking-bob-stoops-fsu-football-campbell-del-rio-rivera-fleck-taggart-bud-elliott-podcast">the Nolecast</a> discussed Kelly as a possibility on their most recent episode. Transcription of this key part of their discussion, via <a href="https://247sports.com/article/Florida-State-Seminoles-head-coaching-search-Brian-Kelly-buyout-Notre-Dame--138917129/">247Sports</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“If Brian Kelly wanted to leave Notre Dame, I think Florida State should jump at that chance,” Elliot said. “He’s an excellent coach, he’s won at multiple jobs at a high level. He’s dealt with some pretty serious academic restraints and restrictions as far as who [recruits] he can sign at Notre Dame…If he did want to leave Notre Dame, perhaps, maybe somebody says ‘Hey, you’re not going to win a National Title at Notre Dame because of the kids you can’t recruit.’ Some of these kids who academically really don’t belong in any college and are really, really good on the football field. The kind of kids you can get at Florida State, but you can’t get at Notre Dame — at least not in the quantity you need to win a title. Maybe that could be a reason he’d want to leave. If so, you need to talk to him pretty seriously. My guess is that he probably wants to stay at Notre Dame…<br/><br/>“Two people have told us they [FSU] has interest in Brian Kelly…I think he’d be an excellent candidate. There’s a little bit of questions about the fit, but the proven track record of hiring assistant coaches and having them get promoted to other jobs and hiring new ones who are as good or better is really impressive. He’s a really good recruiter with his staff. I think he knows what goes on in the Southeast, because we know he’s recruited some of these guys, and not always gotten them, but we know that’s due to some of the academic stuff…”</blockquote>
      <p>Kelly makes sense for a major opening like this, if he’s interested, which is a major question. His background doesn’t scream “Florida State head coach” though.</p>
      <p>Before taking over at Notre Dame, Kelly led Cincinnati, Central Michigan, and Division II Grand Valley State in Michigan. Kelly is from Massachusetts, but all of his high level coaching experience is in the Midwest.</p>
      <p>He can really coach, though, and has won big at every level. And after the experience with childhood Florida State fan Willie Taggart, there may be more of an appetite for an outsider like Brian Kelly in Tallahassee.</p>
