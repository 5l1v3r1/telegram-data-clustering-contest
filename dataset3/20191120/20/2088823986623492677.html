      <p>Since his retirement in 1997, Jim Kelly has been looking to pass the baton of most successful quarterback in Buffalo Bills history.</p>
      <p>The Hall of Famer thinks he finally has a worthy candidate in Josh Allen, who was named AFC Player of the Week on Wednesday for his standout performance in the Bills' 37-20 victory against the Miami Dolphins Sunday.</p>
      <p>Since Allen joined the Bills as a first-round draft pick from Wyoming in 2018, he and Kelly have formed a close bond. As the two explained in an exclusive joint interview with Adam Benigni of <a href="https://www.wgrz.com/">WGRZ</a> and Vic Carucci of The Buffalo News, they talk regularly about the finer points of quarterback play, and they've even discussed one day Kelly turning over his annual charity golf tournament and youth football camp to Allen.</p>
      <p>"He's shared a lot," Allen said. "He's been an open book."</p>
      <p>They have watched video of Kelly running the up-tempo, no-huddle K-Gun offense during the Bills' Super Bowl run in the 1990s. Allen said the team has even incorporated some of those plays into its offense.</p>
      <p>The relationship has come a long way since Allen first met Kelly during a rookie minicamp.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, I was shaking like no other," Allen said.Â "But what he's talked to me about, how he's allowed me to kind of be a part of his (life) and pick his brain. We spent some time together, going to his (hunting) lodge (in Ellicottville) and doing this and that, going to his house. He's been fantastic.</p>
      <p>"I can't thank him enough for what he's done for me and what he continues to do for me and how he's kind of teaching me and taking me under his wing. It's been awesome."</p>

      <p>One of the biggest lessons Kelly said Allen has needed to learn is to take charge on the field, especially when it comes to communicating with offensive coordinator Brian Daboll. Unlike Kelly, who called his own plays when the Bills made the no-huddle attack their offensive foundation, Allen, as with most NFL QBs, has plays dispatched to him via a headset in his helmet.</p>
      <p>"(You tell Daboll), 'These are plays I like, these are plays I don't like, and if it ever comes a point in the game where the play's coming in late, call your own play!' " Kelly said.</p>
      <p>"Daboll gives me the freedom to do that," Allen said. "There were a couple times this Sunday I did it and it worked to our advantage."</p>
      <p>"Wow! You're listening now," Kelly chimed in. "All right!"</p>
      <p>"Third down, one of our first third downs, they were trying to sub out, and I called a play, and we got 'em for 12 men on the field and got a first down," Allen said. "There were a couple other ones."</p>
      <p>"He's listening to Uncle Jim," Kelly said with a laugh.</p>
