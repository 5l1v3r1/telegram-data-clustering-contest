      <p>BERLIN (Reuters) - Turkey has arrested a Turkish lawyer hired by the German Embassy in Ankara, a diplomat at the Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, a measure that could further raise tensions between the NATO partners.</p>
      <p>Relations between the two countries have been strained over German criticism of President Tayyip Erdogan’s crackdown on suspected opponents after a failed coup in 2016 and Turkey’s military offensive last month against Kurdish militia in Syria.</p>
      <p>“We are intensively trying to find out what the accusations are and to lift the remand,” said the German official, declining to be named. “The detention is incomprehensible.”</p>
      <p>The lawyer was arrested in mid-September, the official said.</p>
      <p>The lawyer had been hired by the German Embassy to provide documents related to Turkish citizens who had applied for asylum in Germany, German media reported.</p>
      <p>The number of Turks seeking asylum in Germany has risen since the 2016 failed coup that Erdogan says was planned by supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen who were deeply embedded in Turkey’s institutions.</p>
      <p>Between January and October this year some 9,500 Turks applied for asylum in Germany, up 8% from the same period last year, official figures show, making Turks the third-largest group of asylum seekers after Syrians and Iraqis.</p>
