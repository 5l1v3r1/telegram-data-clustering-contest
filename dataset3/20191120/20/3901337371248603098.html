      <h1>Mnqgithi: It’s Unacceptable…</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:59:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:59</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mnqgithi used strong words when speaking about the club’s lack of honours in domestic cup competitions when taking into account their four Absa Premiership titles in seven years.</p>
      <p>Downs face Golden Arrows in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout on Saturday and Mnqgithi, who took the media responsibilities with head coach Pitso Mosimane recovering from a toothache, said there was no excuse for the lack of success. </p>

      <p>“To be honest, for a team like Sundowns it’s unacceptable not to win these cup competitions. In as much as we’ve already won the Telkom Knockout once, but you look at the number of years we have been here and you can say we deserve to have won it two more times if possible. The MTN8 has eluded us right through, and we have only won the Nedbank Cup once. So, it does concern us,” said Mnqgithi.</p>
      <p>Downs don’t consider domestic trophies, other than the championship, a priority, but even Mosimane has stressed “doing it for the supporters” – the club having last won a cup tournament in the Premier Soccer League as far back as 2015.  </p>
      <p>“Yes, they are not our major trophies that we want to win, but what should stop Sundowns from winning these trophies? It’s difficult to know why we struggle,” added Mnqgithi. </p>
      <p>“But at times we are just unlucky. Last year in Cape Town we played against Cape Town City in the same cup – we conceded a goal that we should not have conceded because it was offside and we were out. Nobody talks about that. This year, in the MTN8 we had stories again against SuperSport. It’s a pity because we would love to win every competition. We do have the team to win all these competitions.”</p>
