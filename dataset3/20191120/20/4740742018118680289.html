      <p>Four men and a woman have been arrested following a raid where a significant amount of Class A and B drugs were seized.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">Avon and Somerset police</a> made the arrests in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">Highbridge</a> as part of a special year-long operation.</p>
      <p>Three properties were raided by officers working for Operation Remedy which has seen an estimated £1.3 million worth of illegal drugs seized over the last six months.</p>
      <p>The five people arrested are aged between 17 and 51 and have been released on bail.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Scott Minall, of Operation Remedy, said: “Drug dealing is a blight on the community and we take the supply of illegal drugs extremely seriously.</p>
      <p>“This operation was launched following community concerns about drug dealing in the area, and is the result of a coordinated effort between Operation Remedy officers and the neighbourhood policing teams to catch and apprehend drug dealers.</p>
      <p>“We continue to work hard to remove drug dealers from our streets. I hope that these arrests will reassure local communities and send a clear message that drug dealing will not be tolerated in Avon and Somerset.”</p>
      <p>Chief Inspector Lisa Simpson, area commander for Somerset West, said: “We have zero tolerance for the supply of drugs in our community, which naturally targets the most vulnerable people whom we work in partnership to protect. I hope that the results of the police operation conducted by Operation Remedy will deter any drug dealers from continuing to operate on our streets.</p>
      <p>“These actions will be followed up with a thorough investigation by the neighbourhood policing team while the anti-social behaviour team will work with partner agencies to prevent these individuals using these addresses for criminal purposes.</p>
      <p>“We want drug dealers to understand they are not welcome in our communities and we will stop them from operating at all cost”.</p>
      <p>Operation Remedy is a coordinated effort in Avon and Somerset to improve force performance in relation to residential burglary, knife crime and the illegal supply of controlled drugs.</p>
