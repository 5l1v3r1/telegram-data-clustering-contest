      <h1>Hedge fund Alden becomes Tribune's largest shareholder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:09:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author">TALI ARBEL, AP Business Writer</a></address>
      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Hedge fund Alden Global Capital is now the largest shareholder of Tribune Publishing, the company that owns the Chicago Tribune, Baltimore Sun and New York Daily News.</p>
      <p>Alden, a hedge fund known for layoffs and slashing costs at newspapers it acquires, bought the 25% stake from former Tribune Chairman Michael Ferro, Tribune said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Tribune said Alden paid about $118 million for the stake and that it is talking with Alden about adding two board seats.</p>
      <p>Ferro stepped down as Tribune chairman in 2018 amid sexual misconduct accusations. His time at Tribune was marked by a much-maligned company name change to "tronc," which was later reverted; the sale of the Los Angeles Times; and pushing off an unsolicited merger bid from rival Gannett.</p>
      <p>The newspaper industry is consolidating as it struggles with a digital transition, and financial firms have become involved as owners and investors. Another newspaper chain, GateHouse, now owns Gannett, with help from a high-interest loan from private equity firm Apollo. Another private equity firm, Fortress, has backed GateHouse and is managing the combined GateHouse-Gannett chain, the country's biggest newspaper publisher, through 2021.</p>
      <p>Alden's Digital First Media owns the Denver Post, Orange County Register, Detroit News and dozens of other papers. It attempted to buy Gannett before the GateHouse deal.</p>
      <p>While all newspaper companies have been affected by the industry downturn, leading to newsroom layoffs and buyouts, Digital First Media has a particularly bitter reputation for cutting costs at its papers.</p>
