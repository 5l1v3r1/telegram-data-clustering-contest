      <h1>Mark Ruffalo Won’t Rule Out a Return For She-Hulk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:22:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Following Mark Ruffalo’s appearance in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame"><b>Avengers: Endgame</b></a>, it’s unsure what the future holds for Professor Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Recently, Ruffalo had a chance to speak with <a href="https://collider.com/will-mark-ruffalo-play-hulk-again-in-mcu-she-hulk/">Collider</a> about the future of the Hulk. And he doesn’t sound very sure about anything.</p>
      <p>“It’s all up in the air,” explained Ruffalo. “I started asking as <b>Endgame</b> was winding down and my contracts were up, I was like, ‘So, you know, is there a place for me here?’ And the response was, ‘Well, we’re going to let this sort of come to an end and then see where we are somewhere in the future.’ So I just took that as a really nice way of saying probably not.”</p>

      <p>However, the announcement of a <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/she-hulk"><b>She-Hulk</b></a> <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/463559-ms-marvel-moon-knight-and-she-hulk-are-coming-to-disney">TV series for Disney+</a> could be the ideal place for Ruffalo to appear. And it sounds like Ruffalo could be on board, since <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/464031-mark-ruffalo-offers-a-mcu-welcome-to-she-hulk">he expressed praise for it</a> when it was announced.</p>
      <p>“I would not rule [a <b>She-Hulk</b> appearance] out at this point,” said Ruffalo. “And I’m supposed to have a talk with Kevin Feige in the next couple of months. So you know, who knows? That’s how it all started. So that might turn into something.”</p>
      <p><b>She-Hulk</b> is currently in pre-production. A start date and premiere date hasn’t been announced.</p>
