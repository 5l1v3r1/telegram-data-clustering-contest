      <h1>ESPN Analyst: Myles Garrett Should Play Again This Season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:54:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett was in New York City today appealing his indefinite suspension from the NFL. Garrett’s punishment stems from last Thursday’s fracas against the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>During a scuffle with Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph, Garrett removed Rudolph’s helmet and swung it at his head. The NFL decided the violent act was worthy of a suspension at least through the end of this season.</p>
      <p>Obviously, Garrett is hoping his ban gets reduced. ESPN analyst Domonique Foxworth thinks it should.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>Get Up!</i> today, Foxworth lobbied for Garrett to play again in 2019. He cited less severe punishments from the NFL for similar transgressions in the past.</p>
      <p>“I think that he should play again this year. I may be alone in that, but there’s no precedent for a penalty this severe for a guy who has no track record,” Foxworth said.</p>
      <p>“I think the right thing to do would be to reduce it.”</p>

      <p>No matter how you feel about the league’s disciplining of Garrett, we should get a final answer on the matter soon.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/cleveland-browns/espn-update-myles-garrett-suspension-appeal">ESPN’s Dianna Russini</a>, the NFL wants to make a decision on Garrett’s appeal “soon.”</p>
