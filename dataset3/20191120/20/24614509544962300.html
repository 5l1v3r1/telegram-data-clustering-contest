      <p>Fears that the phase-one trade deal may be pushed into 2020 spooked investors on Wednesday, as equity markets stumbled lower. Let’s look at a few top stock trades.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Lowe’s (LOW)</h3>

      <p>Above is a weekly chart for <b>Lowe’s</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/low-stock-quote/"><b><u>LOW</u></b></a>), which ripped to new all-time highs on Wednesday after <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/lowes-earnings-boost-low-stock-up/">better-than-expected earnings</a>.</p>
      <p>The stock has been putting in a very solid series of higher lows, shown via uptrend support (blue line). Each dip to the 100-week moving average has been bought.</p>
      <p>Nowhere near that area now, though, what should investors do? Over $115 and LOW looks good on the long side. This mark has been resistance over the past year, so above it now bodes well for longs. Below and a dip to the 50-week moving average is possible.</p>
      <h3>No. 2: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)</h3>

      <p>The run in <b>Advanced Micro Devices</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amd-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMD</u></b></a>) could be coming to an end.</p>
      <p>To be clear, the broader market may be just fine in regards to the trade situation. But AMD has been downright explosive. After shares erupted through $34.50 resistance at the start of November, new all-time highs were made over $35.55.</p>
      <p>On a pullback, this area acted as support, which is a bullish development.</p>
      <p>Since then, shares have climbed north of $40. It wouldn’t be surprising to see this trade unwind at some point. A dip down to the 20-day moving average — which is all the way down at $36.62 right now! — would be the first step. But ultimately, a check-back down to the $34.50 to $35.50 area would be most attractive for longs.</p>
      <h3> No. 3: Urban Outfitters (URBN)</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><b>Urban Outfitters</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/urbn-stock-quote/"><b><u>URBN</u></b></a>) has been climbing very steadily from its August lows, rallying from sub-$20 to more than $31 ahead of earnings. For those keeping track, that’s more than a 50% gain in just a few months.</p>
      <p>To see this trade backpedal a bit comes as little surprise.</p>
      <p>Gapping below all of its major moving averages isn’t good, though, and now support needs to come into play in order for bulls to have a chance. The $24 mark was resistance from June through August. On a pullback, this area acted as support in September. It helps that the 78.6% retracement for the one-year range is down at $23.89.</p>
      <p>On a rebound, see that URBN reclaims its 100-week moving average. Going above that level puts the 200-day on the table. Below $24 puts $22 on the table.</p>
      <h3>No. 4: S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY)</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/5-top-stock-trades-for-tuesday-nvda-iwm-xrx-roku-and-i/">we looked at the small-caps ETF</a>, the <b>iShares Russell 2000 ETF</b> (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/iwm-stock-quote/"><b><u>IWM</u></b></a>). While that one has had trouble advancing, the <b>SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF</b> (NYSEARCA:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/spy-stock-quote/"><b><u>SPY</u></b></a>) sure hasn’t.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, we got the first sign of selling in a while, even though bulls bid the SPY up off the lows.</p>
      <p>Look, a pullback down to the 20-day is not only appropriate, but it’s also healthy. Markets were technically overbought coming into Tuesday and a little shakeout keeps traders in check and could give longs a better opportunity.</p>
      <p>Many might agree with this, but few will like if it actually pans out. But it would be best to get a 3% to 4% correction in the SPY. Some kind of correction down into the $300-ish area could be a gift to the bulls, allowing one last buying opportunity into year-end. A decline into this area puts the SPY into its 50-day moving average and down into prior resistance near $300. The October Fed-day range is between ~$302 and $304.50. A return into this area that holds as support would be a bullish sign.</p>
      <p>Below $300 causes more uncertainty, while a 5% correction puts the SPY into uptrend support (blue line).</p>
      <p>There’s no telling what kind of correction this may or may not end up being. But there are varying degrees of healthiness. A 5% dip will definitely cause some concern, but a fall into the $300 to $305 area could be very attractive, provided support holds where it should.</p>
