      <p>It's now just over a week until Black Friday 2019 arrives and no doubt brings with it a bunch of <a href="https://www.wareable.com/smartwatches/smartwatch-fitness-tracker-deals-6764">smartwatch deals</a>. If you're not the patient type, however, this deal on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active might grab your attention.</p>

        <p>Right now, it's being sold for $50 off the usual price, bringing it down to just $150 and by far the best Galaxy Watch Active deal this side of Black Friday.</p>

        <p>There's no guarantees the price will be lower during the influx of Samsung smartwatch discounts, but we have predicted there's a strong chance the Galaxy Watch Active will feature. It's just a question of whether the deals will top this current record low price.</p>
        <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
        <anchor name="Article-Middle">
          <p>There's a relatively good chance, mainly because the Galaxy Watch Active 2 is now on the scene. That means retailers will want to clear stock of the (slightly) older model. Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.wareable.com/samsung/cheap-samsung-galaxy-smartwatch-deals-6765">Samsung smartwatch Black Friday</a> page for other deals to expect.</p>
          <p>We gave the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active a stellar 4/5 review, and it's a particularly great smartwatch choice for anyone more fitness-inclined. Especially if you've typically found Samsung's smartwatches a little too big for your wrist.</p>
          <p>One of the best elements of Samsung's Tizen OS is the support for offline Spotify playlists. So if you're a Spotify Premium subscriber, you can save your favourite tracks to the Galaxy Watch Active's built-in storage, meaning you can leave your phone behind if you want music during your workout.</p>
          <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
          <p>Our review concluded: "The Galaxy Watch Active is an enjoyable smartwatch to live with, more so than the standard Galaxy Watches in many ways. If you want a smartwatch that's small and light, but doesn't scrimp on features, then there's a lot to like here."</p>

          <p>Needless to say, this is a great price for a fully-featured sporty smartwatch. If it doesn't quite tick the boxes for you, there will no doubt be a raft of other wearable deals during Black Friday, so be sure to check out our other content hubs during the sales bonanza.</p>
