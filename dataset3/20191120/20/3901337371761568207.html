      <h1>Pirates’ 2019 Fate To Be Decided In Limpopo…    </h1>

      <p>As attempts to change the fortunes of Orlando Pirates for the season continue, with the Soweto giants looking to finish the year in a respectable position on the Absa Premiership log, the team’s fate for the year will be decided in Limpopo. </p>
      <p>The Buccaneers will be desperate for points to improve on their current position on the log. Rulani Mokwena’s team is 9th on the standings with only three wins from 11 matches, having collected 13 points out of a possible 33.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With nine points to play for in the next three matches, Bucs could finish the year in a comfortable position among the top teams on the log, depending on results from the other matches.</p>
      <p>Pirates’ last three matches for 2019 will all be against teams from Limpopo – two at home and one away.  </p>
      <p>Bucs are scheduled to host Polokwane City at the Orlando Stadium next Tuesday in their upcoming fixture, with the next one after that away to Baroka FC at the Peter Mokaba Stadium on December 07.  </p>

      </p>
      <p>The last of the three fixtures will be against Black Leopards in Orlando on December 21. A confidence booster for Bucs going into the matches could be to look back at last season's results against the three teams in first round matches under former coach Milutin Sredojevic. </p>
      <p>Bucs won all three – 2-1 v Leopards in August, 2-1 v Baroka in September, as well as the 2-1 victory over City in November.  </p>
