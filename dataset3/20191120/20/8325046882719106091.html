      <h3>How to use Keynote on your iPhone</h3>
      <p>To create a new Keynote project, open the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480">Keynote app</a>, which is a blue box with a white image of a lectern inside it.</p>
      <p>Tap the “Create Presentation” icon – it’s the plus (+) symbol in the top-right – then select the theme you wish to use. You can always use your own images in the slides, so don’t be thrown off by the stock images.</p>

        <figcaption>There are a great number of preset themes to choose between.<cite>Steven John/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Once inside the new project, double-tap in the various boxes on the first slide to add text or media. You can simply begin typing after double tapping, or hit the plus symbol at the top to add images, graphs, video, audio, drawings, and more.</p>
      <p>To add a new slide, hit the plus symbol in a blue box at the bottom left corner of the screen. Slides can always be dragged into new order by tapping, holding, and moving them up or down in the pane on the left.</p>

        <figcaption>Add a slide by tapping the lower-left “+” symbol.<cite>Steven John/Business Insider</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>To add transitions between your slides (and alter various other settings) tap the three little dots in a circle in the top-right corner and select “Transitions and Builds.” Then tap the slide to which you want to add a transition, tap “Add Transition,” and then make your selection.</p>
      <p>Using Keynote can be a collaborative process; just hit the “Add People” button at the top of the screen (it looks like a silhouette of a stick figure’s head and shoulders in a circle), and invite others to work with you.</p>

      <p>Once you’re happy with your Keynote presentation, it’s time to export it. Tap those three dots at the top-right and select “Export.” You can then choose the type of file you’d like to create, which can then be shared with others, saved to your phone, sent to Google Drive, and so on.</p>
