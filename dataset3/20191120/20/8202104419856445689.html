      <h3>A Saskatoon Queen’s Bench judge ruled a man used “unreasonable” force and wasn’t acting in self-defence when he bit off the tip of another man’s finger during an alcohol-fuelled confrontation.</h3>
      <p>Amjal Peroz testified at his September trial that he was defending himself against a stranger who put him in a chokehold and stuffed his fingers inside his mouth. Justice Richard Danyliuk said he did not accept Peroz’s defence, or much of his testimony, and ultimately convicted the 41-year-old on Tuesday of aggravated assault.</p>

      <p>According to testimony from the judge-alone trial, contained in a written decision, the victim approached Peroz outside Divas nightclub in the early morning hours of July 7, 2018 because he believed the man was assaulting a woman.</p>
      <p>The victim and two witnesses testified about seeing Peroz dragging the woman, who they said was resisting, yelling “no” and crying.</p>
      <p>The victim said he approached Peroz and told him to let the woman go. He and his friend both recalled hearing Peroz say “f**k off,” and “this is my wife, my property.” The man said he briefly scuffled with Peroz, but it was quickly broken up.</p>
      <p>The victim’s girlfriend and friend, who were also out that night, said they called police and asked the woman if she needed help. The victim and his girlfriend then left, but encountered the couple a short while later near a Fourth Avenue parking lot.</p>
      <p>The man told court the woman was “hysterical” and he believed Peroz had hurt her again. He testified he put Peroz in a “bear-hug” to keep him away from the woman and hold him until police arrived.</p>
      <p>The men fell to the ground and the victim said Peroz bit him three times, severing the tip of his left pinky finger.</p>
      <p>Danyliuk said he found the victim’s evidence “imperfect,” but that the core of it was corroborated by the two other witnesses, who Danyliuk called “objective and fair.”</p>
      <p>He also accepted most of the testimony from Peroz’s ex-wife and convicted Peroz of assault for dragging her without her consent.</p>
      <p>The woman testified she and Peroz had recently split up but were trying to rekindle their relationship. She said she got very drunk, but remembers Peroz yelling at her for talking to other men, pulling on her arm after she fell in an alley and telling people to mind their own business because “She’s my wife, I can do what I want.”</p>
      <p>Peroz testified his ex was angry at him for the earlier incident and that he was trying to help her stand up after she fell. He denied dragging her or calling her his “property,” and said the man in the alley misunderstood what was happening between them and attacked him “out of nowhere.”</p>
      <p>In his decision, Danyliuk said Peroz gave conflicting testimony about suffering a concussion during the second fight and having memory gaps as a result of blacking out. He said he also found Peroz’s denial about acting controlling, violent and angry to be self-serving, and that his reason for biting the man’s finger made no sense.</p>
      <p>“Among other things, this smacks of Mr. Peroz making up his evidence as he went along and tailoring it to fit the Crown evidence he had already heard,” Danyliuk concluded.</p>
      <p>He said there was an “air of reality” to the self-defence argument, but found the Crown negated the argument by proving Peroz was not in a life-threatening chokehold that required him to sever a man’s fingertip with his teeth.</p>
      <p>“I was not sure where I was going to end up,” Danyliuk said following his decision. “It wasn’t a forgone conclusion.”</p>
      <p>Sentencing arguments have been adjourned to Dec. 6.</p>
