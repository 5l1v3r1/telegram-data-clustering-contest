      <p>Popular brand Utility have shown off their huge new premises in Liverpool city centre.</p>
      <p>Fans of the independent store, which opened on Bold Street in 2004, were gutted when the company announced they would be <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/bold-street-store-is-closing-16525353">shutting one of their stores</a> at the end of August.</p>
      <p>At the time, shoppers were told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/bold-street-store-is-closing-16525353">store would be moving</a> to a larger, more suitable premises, by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Today, Utility have revealed that new store will be located inside a former warehouse on Flint Street in the Baltic Triangle.</p>
      <p>It is expected to be open to the public by spring 2020.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson for Utility told the ECHO: "Liverpool based design store Utility has purchased new premises in the city’s Baltic Triangle.</p>
      <p>"The Flint Street building comprises a two storey brick built former warehouse in Liverpool’s creative hub.</p>
      <p>"The building will be the new home to the company’s furniture and lighting store as well as their growing web team.</p>
      <p>Director of Utility, Richard Skelton, said: “We have been on the hunt for our own building in the city which is more suitable to our current needs.</p>
      <p>"Our new building – which has a working title of ‘The Flint’ will not be a furniture showroom or store in the conventional sense.</p>

      <p>"Not only are we creating a home for our web team, we are also expanding our contract team to serve our growing number of contract clients.</p>
      <p>"The building will give us a home to host events, meeting for architects and designers, product launches and so on. We want to create a space which lends itself to anything and – going back to our Coffee Union roots, which we sold in 2002 – the building will also a have a coffee shop,  as well as a potential element of co-working space to rent.</p>
      <p>"This is a really exciting project for us; it’s a big building for which we have big plans.”</p>
      <p>Established in 1999, Utility is an independent Liverpool brand with currently two stores on Bold Street, one in Liverpool ONE and another on Oxford Road in Manchester.</p>
      <p>Talking back in August about the decision to close one store, Richard Skelton, director of Utility, said: "We have long outgrown our Bold Street furniture store and it’s no longer fit for purpose in the modern retailing landscape.</p>
      <p>"38% of our turnover is now online and we are seeking space complementary to our online offer where customers can see larger furniture ranges and view a more comprehensive offer."</p>
