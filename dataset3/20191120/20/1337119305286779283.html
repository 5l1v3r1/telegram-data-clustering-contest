      <h1>PopSockets made an AirPods grip, and it is godawful</h1>
      <h2>Nope, nope, nope</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:27:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/bijan-stephen" target="_blank">Bijan Stephen</a></address>
      <p>There are some objects that spit in the face of god, either in their design or their intended use, and another such product has just entered our reality. PopSocket — the makers of the now-ubiquitous, carpal tunnel-saving doohickeys that adorn the backs of many smartphones — has now made a PopGrip (its term) that is an AirPods case. It looks like a tumorous growth out of the back of your phone, but hey, you probably won’t lose your AirPods again — only your dignity.</p>
      <p>Like the other PopGrips, the PopGrip AirPods Holder can be swapped out for other grips. It’s detachable, and it works with wireless charging. It comes in a variety of colors. It retails for $20, and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsockets.com%2Fshop%2Fall-popgrips%2Fpopgrip-airpods-holders%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;referrer=theverge.com">you can buy it directly from PopGrip online</a>. The only question to ask yourself before you buy it, really, is how high you’d price your pride.</p>
