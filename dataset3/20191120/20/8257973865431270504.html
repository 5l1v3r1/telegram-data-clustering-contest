      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- Actor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jussie-Smollett/?tps=1">Jussie Smollett</a> countersued the city of Chicago for malicious prosecution, following his discredited claim that he was attacked by assailants in January.</p>
      <p><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/jussie-smollett-countersues-city-chicago-maliciously-prosecuting-bad/story?id=67165840">The lawsuit</a>, filed Tuesday, says that the city prosecuted Smollett in bad faith and filed criminal charges against him "without probable cause."</p>
      <p>Smollett, formerly a cast member of the television program "Empire," told police that he was confronted near his Chicago home by two masked attackers, who poured a chemical substance on him, wrapped a rope around his neck and made comments suggesting that he, an African-American, was unwelcome in the area. Doubts about Smollett's story led to the arrest of two men who were allegedly paid to perform a fake attack. A 16-count indictment against Smollett, which included a charge of felony disorderly conduct in relation to filing a false report, was later reduced to $10,000 and community service. The city later demanded $130,160 <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/04/12/Chicago-seeks-130K-from-Jussie-Smollett-for-police-investigation/4651555071695/">in a lawsuit</a> for civil penalties, damages and attorney's fees arising from the incident.</p>
      <p>The countersuit <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2019/11/20/20973937/jussie-smollett-malicious-prosecution-counterclaim-chicago">lists accusations</a> against the city; the Chicago Police Department; Supt. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Eddie_Johnson/?tps=1">Eddie Johnson</a>, Det. Michael Theis and Det. Edward Wodnicki of the police department, and Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, the two men allegedly involved in the attack. It seeks a jury trial and an undetermined dollar figure for compensatory and punitive damages. It does not identify the Cook County State Attorney's Office as a defendant.</p>
      <p>In October a federal judge ruled that the city's lawsuit against Smollett, to reclaim the $130,160, can proceed.</p>
