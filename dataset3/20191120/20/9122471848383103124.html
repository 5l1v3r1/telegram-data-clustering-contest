      <h1>Browns Player Reacts To Baker Mayfield’s Comments On Myles Garrett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:26:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>The biggest story from last week’s showdown between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers had nothing to do with football. Almost every sports fan spent the weekend talking about Myles Garrett and Mason Rudolph’s fight that took place in the final seconds.</p>
      <p>Garrett’s actions on Thursday night put the Cleveland Browns in a tough position, but second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield tried to handle the situation with class.</p>
      <p>When asked about the brawl between Garrett and Rudolph, Mayfield was <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/baker-mayfield-has-brutally-honest-reaction-to-myles-garrett-ejection">brutally honest about it. </a></p>
      <p>“That’s inexcusable, he knows that. I don’t care rivalry or not, we can’t do that. The reality is he’s going to get suspended,” Mayfield said.</p>
      <p>There were a few critics that didn’t like that Mayfield made those remarks. On the flip side, it appears his postgame comments sat well with his teammates.</p>
      <p>Browns offensive guard Joel Bitonio praised Mayfield, saying he “handled it like a leader.”</p>

      <p>Mayfield seems to be handling this situation as well as fans could have hoped for.</p>
      <p>Earlier today, he spoke about how the <a href="https://twitter.com/diannaESPN/status/1197244617319735296">team needs to have next-man-up mentality</a> moving forward since they’ll be without Garrett for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Following a very slow start to the season, Mayfield has finally found his rhythm. He’ll try to keep it going when the Browns host the Miami Dolphins this Sunday.</p>
