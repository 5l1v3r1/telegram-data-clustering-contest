      <ul>
        <li>True-Tech claims to have received internal product diagrams for the OnePlus 8 Pro.</li>
        <li>The leaks show the phone with a hole-punch display, interestingly with a possible dual-camera setup.</li>
        <li>Round back, there are three camera sensors alongside a ToF sensor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>OnePlus jumped on the truly bezel-less bandwagon with the OnePlus 7 Pro's pop-up front camera, but it seems the company is going back to a more 'typical' selfie shooter with the next iteration of its smartphone, the OnePlus 8. The 'normal' OnePlus has had a teardrop notch since the OnePlus 7; only the Pro variant of the last two iterations of OnePlus' offerings features a pop-up camera. Now, leaked documents obtained by <a href="https://true-tech.net/oneplus/exclusive-oneplus-8-pro-product-diagram-leaks-showing-four-camera-sensors/"><i>True-Tech</i></a> suggest OnePlus is looking to standardize the tech it uses for its front cameras by opting for a hole-punch display on both devices. The Pro variant may, however, feature two sensors instead of one.</p>
      <p>The product diagrams, which True-Tech says were provided by a OnePlus employee, also line up with previous leaks, which show a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-our-first-look-oneplus-8-pro">quad-camera setup on the back</a> of the phone. The main camera module will comprise of three sensors, much like the OnePlus 7T — they may even be the same sensors as the previous generations — but it will be augmented by a ToF sensor to help with better depth-sensing for portrait shots and more. They also suggest that OnePlus may opt for a two-tone flash, instead of a tri-tone variant.</p>
      <p>While the diagrams obviously don't give away much in terms of the phone's specifications, previous leaks suggest the company may be looking to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-rumor-says-oneplus-8-pro-will-have-120hz-display">implement a 120Hz display on the OnePlus 8 Pro</a>. It's also not far-fetched to believe the handsets will come with the latest Qualcomm silicon at launch, likely the Snapdragon 865.</p>
