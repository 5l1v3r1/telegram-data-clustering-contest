      <p>Mark Walton will likely never get signed and touch an NFL field again after he was arrested and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant woman after he allegedly punched his pregnant girlfriend “several times in her face and head.”</p>
      <p>The Miami Dolphins released him immediately.</p>
      <p>TMZ Sports has now obtained audio of the 911 call his girlfriend made after she was allegedly beat up by the free agent running back.</p>

      <blockquote>“The pregnant woman who was allegedly punched in the head repeatedly by NFL running back Mark Walton called cops sobbing and told them, “My boyfriend beat me up!”<br/><br/>It’s all in new 911 audio obtained by TMZ Sports, in which you can hear a clearly upset woman explaining to dispatch how the ex-Miami Dolphins player roughed her up Tuesday in Davie, Fla.<br/><br/>During the call, placed about 10 to 15 minutes after the incident, the sobbing woman says Walton had hit her and then left the scene in a car.<br/><br/>What’s interesting about the call is dispatch recognized Walton’s name right away … asking the woman if she was talking about “the football player.”</blockquote>
      <p>Officers on the scene stated they “observed swelling to the woman’s left eye.”</p>
