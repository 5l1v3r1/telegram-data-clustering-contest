      <h1>Borderlands 3 Moxxi’s Heist of The Handsome Jackpot DLC releases next month</h1>

      <p>The first expansion for Borderlands 3 has been announced by Gearbox, and it is called Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot. As you may guess from the title Moxxi and her crew are looking to grab some riches. In this story, players will be heading to The Handsome Jackpot, a now derelict casino space station. Derelict doesn’t mean deserted though as the space station is populated by armed Loader Bots and looters than have been stuck on the station since Handsome Jack died.</p>

      <p>The expansion will add new campaign missions and challenges, legendary weapons, customisation gear and the return of Hyperion forces that have remained in place along with new enemy types and bosses. This DLC will require to have hit at least level 13 though enemies will scale up if you are above that level when you start the content.</p>
      <p>That isn’t the only content as Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite is a new raid which is designed for teams whose characters are at max level as enemies will be tough, and there will also be limited respawns.  Mayhem 4 mode removes all player penalties and replaces the system by giving a random modifier to players and a random modifier to enemies. Staying on Mayhem Gearbox has confirmed it is working on Mayhem 2.0 which will add new modifiers, playlists, and levels. Mayhem 2.0 won’t be out until next year.</p>
      <p>A patch is also rolling out for Borderlands 3 and will address the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <blockquote>All bosses will now have dedicated loot pools so you can more efficiently farm for coveted Legendary items;</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li/>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Maximum Bank Space will be upgraded from 50 to 300 slots; as usual, SDUs that boost your bank size can be purchased from Marcus aboard Sanctuary III;</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li/>
        <li>
          <blockquote>A Target Dummy wearing a very familiar mask will be installed in Sanctuary III’s shooting range so you can safely test out your weapons;</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li/>
        <li>
          <blockquote>New Vending Machines will be deployed across multiple maps;</blockquote>
        </li>
        <li/>
        <li>
          <blockquote>Players will notice overall UI performance improvements.</blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>
