      <p><a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1757/sara-mcmann">Sara McMann</a> will be hunting for her first win in almost two years when she competes in North Carolina.</p>
      <p>The one-time bantamweight title challenger has been booked to fight <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3799/lina-lansberg">Lina Lansberg</a> at <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fight-card/1087/ufc-fight-night-blaydes-vs-dos-santos">UFC Raleigh</a> on Jan. 25, officials <a href="https://twitter.com/UFCEurope/status/1197243214379409408">announced</a> Wednesday.</p>
      <p>This will be McMannâ€™s first fight since February 2018. She is coming off of back-to-back submission losses to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3099/marion-reneau">Marion Reneau</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3796/ketlen-vieira">Ketlen Vieira</a>. Prior to that, McMann (11-5) had won three straight, though she has not had her hand raised since defeating <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2295/gina-mazany">Gina Mazany</a> at a Fight Night event in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Feb, 19, 2017.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was scheduled to fight <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4161/nicco-montano">Nicco Montano</a> in July, but was forced to withdraw due to injury.</p>
      <p>Lansberg (10-4) is on her first UFC win streak after alternating wins and losses in her first five Octagon appearances. The 37-year-old has picked up consecutive victories over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/4416/macy-chiasson">Macy Chiasson</a> and former Invicta FC champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2000/tonya-evinger">Tonya Evinger</a>.</p>
      <p>UFC Raleigh takes place at PNC Arena in Raleigh, N.C. and will be headlined by a heavyweight bout between <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3622/curtis-blaydes">Curtis Blaydes</a> and former UFC champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/22/junior-dos-santos">Junior dos Santos</a>.
