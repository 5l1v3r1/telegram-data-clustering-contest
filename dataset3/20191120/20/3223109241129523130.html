      <h1>Strange Skeletons Found in Wales May Be Shipwreck Victims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:22:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/genevieve_scarano/" target="_blank">Genevieve Scarano</a></address>
      <p>Archaeologists recently discovered mysterious skeletons in Wales believed to be <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/mysterious-shipwreck-of-captain-cooks-endeavour-possibly-discovered-in-rhode-island-1804158/">victims of a shipwreck</a>.</p>
      <p>Experts from Natural Resources Wales and <a href="https://www.geek.com/news/archaeologists-reconstruct-medieval-scottish-mans-face-for-first-time-1808711/">archaeologists</a> from Cardiff University and the Glamorgan-Gwent Archaeological Trust (GGAT) worked together to excavate the skeletal remains of at least six individuals eroding from a cliff in Cwm Nash, <a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/news/view/1724238-skeletons-retrieved-from-welsh-coastline-in-rescue-excavations">Cardiff University said in a statement</a>. The rescue excavation, which took eight days (three in July and five in September), will enable researchers to learn more about these individuals.</p>

      <p>“Many of the skeletons have lost bones to the sea, but early analysis of the burial positions of the individuals has been revealing,”Jacqui Mulville, who led the Cardiff University team, explained. “Our latest thinking is that these are Tudor or Stuart men who may have been the victims of shipwreck. We aim to tell more of their stories and return their identities to them through ongoing post-excavation analysis.”</p>
      <p>At the site, the team found individuals buried side-by-side or together in a single grave, while a younger individual was buried away from the rest of the group. Additional investigations of two further graves didn’t result in any remains due to coastal erosion, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/science/mysterious-skeletons-discovered-cliff-shipwreck-victims">Fox News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear how old these individuals are, however, previous radiocarbon dating of individuals recovered from the Cwm Nash cemetery has determined those discovered as late 16th or early 17th century. These individuals most likely lived during the early modern period of the Tudors and the Stuarts, families that reigned the Great Britain from the late 1400s to the early 1700s.</p>
      <p>Cardiff University bioarchaeologists will continue to study the human remains into next year.</p>

      <p>Insights focused on the first excavated individual will be shown on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000bn2l">BBC Four’s Digging for Britain</a> on Nov. 20.</p>
