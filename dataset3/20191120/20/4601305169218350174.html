      <p>A startup based in Seattle says they plan to offer an alternative to human burial and cremation in Washington state, now that it's finally legal. Yep, human composting.</p>
      <p>Won't take it personally if you don't read the rest of this blog post.</p>
      <p>Seriously.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/life/recompose-the-human-composting-project-finds-a-home-in-seattles-sodo/">The Seattle Times</a></i> was among the first to report of the human composting service Recompose last week, when founder Katrina Spade hosted a launch event in Seattle’s Sodo district.</p>
      <blockquote>Officials say Spade partnered with a soil scientist who led a successful research trial and convinced legislators to change state law effective May 2020 about the disposition of the dead.<br/><br/>Company officials say Recompose is expected to open in 2021 and cost $5,500 each customer, more than basic cremation, but less than most funerals. <br/><br/>Officials say each body would produce about 1 cubic yard of soil.<br/><br/>Officials say excess soil is expected to be sent to land intended to become an ecologically sustainable village.</blockquote>
