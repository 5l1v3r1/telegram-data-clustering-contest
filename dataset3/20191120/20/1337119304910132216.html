      <h1>Amazon’s cloud gaming service could arrive next year and offer Twitch integration</h1>
      <h2>2020 is shaping up to be a big year for cloud gaming</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:09:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service launched on November 19th (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel">and you probably shouldn’t buy into it just yet</a>), but we’re already hearing more about Amazon’s rumored entry into the space. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/"><i>CNET</i> reports</a> that Amazon is planning to announce its own cloud gaming service next year. <i>CNET’s</i> story corroborates a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-developing-game-streaming-service?shared=1aaeb3e97b12aa05">January report from <i>The Information</i></a>, which first revealed the existence of the service and said that it likely wouldn’t launch until 2020 at the earliest.</p>
      <p>Job listings have also given us some evidence that Amazon has a cloud gaming service on the way. The company has been hiring for a “new initiative” in its Amazon Web Services team (AWS underpins many cloud-based services you use every day) that, according to <i>CNET’s</i> sources, is involved with the new gaming service. One job posting found by <i>CNET</i> apparently says that Amazon plans to integrate the service with Twitch, which sounds similar to Google’s eventual plans for integrating Stadia and YouTube.</p>
      <p><i>The Verge </i>found a <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/936503/principal-product-leader-new-aws-gaming-initiative?tag=theverge02-20">job listing</a> that’s up right now for a “Principal Product Leader” for a “New AWS Gaming Initiative.” The listing doesn’t reveal any details about what the service might look like, but it does contain, uh, a pretty bold statement about Amazon’s gaming ambitions:</p>
      <blockquote>We believe the evolution that began with arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and e-sports of today, will continue to a future where everyone is a gamer and every gamer can create, compete, collaborate and connect with others at massive scales.</blockquote>
      <p>After <i>The Information</i>’s original report in January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/10/18177253/amazon-cloud-gaming-service-rumor-job-posting"><i>The Verge</i> previously found</a> two job listings for engineers that would work on “Cloud Games,” including one listing that explicitly mentioned some kind of new games business.</p>
      <aside>It makes sense that Amazon wants to make a cloud gaming service</aside>
      <p>Though you may not think of Amazon as a gaming company, it makes some sense that it wants to make a cloud gaming service and that it understands the massive potential for such a service. AWS already powers much of the internet (including huge games <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/EPICGames/?tag=theverge02-20">like <i>Fortnite</i></a>), which means Amazon already has a massive amount of infrastructure and streaming know-how at its disposal that it could use to try to make a reliable cloud gaming service. Amazon also owns Twitch, an incredibly popular live-streaming service, which probably gives Amazon a lot of intel about the types of games people might spend hours playing every single day.</p>
      <p>Amazon has experimented with cloud gaming before. Check out this video of a hybrid Amazon cloud game where you wield a giant crossbow that’s running on an Amazon Fire tablet to fight back hordes of enemies that are created by remote servers. The graphics look a little dated, but keep in mind that the game, made by Amazon’s own <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon Game Studios</a>, was released all the way back in 2014:</p>

      <p>Five years later, perhaps Amazon feels the technology to power cloud gaming is in a good enough place to attempt to make a more comprehensive service.</p>
      <p>Amazon and Google aren’t the only companies making a serious run at cloud gaming, of course. It’s quickly becoming a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18683382/what-is-cloud-gaming-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-faq-explainer">hot new battleground</a> for tech companies, even if it’s not exactly a new idea. Early players <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/7/2/3131408/sony-computer-entertainment-buys-gaikai-for-380-million">Gaikai</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8337955/sony-buys-onlive-only-to-shut-it-down">OnLive</a> were acquired by Sony to help it better power its PlayStation Now service, and Nvidia has been testing GeForce Now for years.</p>
      <aside>More companies are joining the cloud gaming fray</aside>
      <p>But now, more companies are jumping into the fray, and there soon could be a dizzying number of cloud gaming choices to pick from. Microsoft’s Project xCloud service, now in preview, has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964411/microsoft-project-xcloud-new-games-list-50-games-support">more than 50 games</a>. EA held a two-week test of its Project Atlas cloud gaming service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857805/ea-cloud-gaming-service-surprise-closed-beta-project-atlas">in September</a>. Code on a Valve website mentions something called “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952028/steam-valve-code-stadia-xcloud-cloud-gaming-service-competitor-streaming">Steam Cloud Gaming</a>.” Nintendo has tested <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/16/17866542/assassins-creed-odyssey-nintendo-switch-streaming-japan">streaming games</a> to the Switch in Japan. In January, <i>The Verge</i> reported that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/11/18179048/verizon-gaming-video-game-streaming-service-vzg-nvidia-shield-android">Verizon is testing Verizon Gaming</a> on the Nvidia Shield. And even Walmart is apparently exploring its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18276235/walmart-cloud-gaming-service-google-stadia-competitor">cloud gaming service</a>.</p>
      <p>2020 is shaping up to be a big year for cloud gaming, and Amazon could be one of the big players.</p>
