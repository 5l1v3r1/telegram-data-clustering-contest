      <p>An electrical fault sparked off the huge bushfire that destroyed or damaged 11 properties on the Yorke Peninsula, with reports suggesting it was at the town's water tower. The CFS is "optimistic" it will contain the fire within days. Picture: 7 News</p>
      <p>The CFS is "optimistic" it will soon contain the fire, which jumped containment lines overnight and threatened Edithburgh.</p>
      <p>The fire has now been downgraded to an Advice message as changing weather conditions allow firefighters to stop its rapid expansion.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PLEASE NOTE: This live blog has now ended. You can get the latest on the fire at <a href="http://Advertiser.com.au/">Advertiser.com.au</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>At least 11 properties, including homes and sheds, have been damaged and approximately 5000 hectares burned with a 61km fire perimeter.</p>
      <p>CFS incident controller Richard de Groot said he was “confident” weather conditions would allow crews to fully contain the blaze over the coming days.</p>
      <p>He said there have been occasional outbreaks, but in these conditions they are easily doused. The fire is not yet contained but is no longer rapidly expanding.</p>
      <p>He confirmed the cause of the fire was a fault with electrical infrastructure, but did not know exactly where it started, despite reports that it was near the Yorketown water tower.</p>
      <p>Mr de Groot said there has been a “significant level” of livestock and crop damage, as well as farming machinery.</p>
      <p>Animal welfare authorities are supporting landowners with affected livestock and whether some animals need to be euthanised.</p>
      <p>An emergency relief centre is open at the Stansbury Bowling Club - 19 Weaver Street, Stansbury. Anyone displaced by the fire or unsure if they can go home or otherwise affected can register at the centre to seek assistance.</p>
      <p>St Vincent Highway is closed between Edithburgh and Yorketown. Lake Fowler Road is closed to traffic heading west out of Coobowie.</p>
      <p>Fires are burning near the Yorke Hwy in Price - between Ardrossan and Port Clinton in the upper Yorke Peninsula - but the threat has been reduced, and all previous road closures in the area have been lifted.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a smoke advice message was issued for Appila, Caltowie and Jamestown in the Mid North region as CFS and emergency service crews remain on the scene extinguishing hot spots from an earlier blaze.</p>
