      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> bosses have banned campmates from consuming live insects as part of Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>Throughout the show’s history, celebrities have been faced with the challenge of eating creepy crawlies – but that’s all set to end.</p>
      <p>Instead, campmates will now only be served up dead insects as part of the grisly trials, with no wiggly worms or crawling spiders allowed near the celebs’ mouths.</p>
      <p>That means in Wednesday night’s Bushtucker Trial, which will see <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-adele-roberts-retches-eating-pig-uterus-disgusting-"> Roberts and </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-adele-roberts-retches-eating-pig-uterus-disgusting-"> tackle the eating challenge</a>, they won’t have to catch their dinner before they can eat it.</p>
      <h3>Why has eating live bugs on I’m A Celebrity been banned?</h3>

      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>A show source told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat: ‘I’m A Celebrity producers have taken a look at the trials and decided that no live critters would be eaten in the trials this year.</p>
      <p>‘They have been planning this for some time and actually last year beach worms were the only critters eaten live but this time around they’ve decided to implement the change fully and permanently.’</p>

      <p>I’m A Celebrity has faced <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/22/its-time-to-ban-eating-live-creatures-on-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-7080860/">criticism for its use of live animals and insects in Bushtucker Trials</a> throughout its 19-series history.</p>
      <p>Wildlife experts and animal charities have repeatedly condemned producers for the ‘cruel’ and ‘abusive’ treatment of live creatures in tasks.</p>
      <p>BBC Autumn Watch presenter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/chris-packham-says-im-a-celebrity-bug-eating-trials-are-just-as-bad-as-eating-a-live-baby-monkey-11166760/">Chris Packman</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/im-a-celebritys-bushtucker-trials-normalise-animal-cruelty-and-must-end-11073538/">animals rights activist Tayana Simons</a>, and vegan blogger Lucy Watson are also among those to have spoken out.</p>
      <p>Chris previously <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/chris-packham-calls-on-ant-and-dec-to-stop-animal-cruelty-on-im-a-celebrity-by-axing-bushtucker-trials-11002775/">called on I’m A Celebrity hosts Ant McPartlin and Dec Donnelly</a> to consider the use of insects in the show.</p>

      <p>On hearing this latest news, he said he was ‘very pleased’ to learn of the decision to ban the eating of live creatures, while on BBC Radio 5 Live.</p>
      <p>The presented added: ‘What’s long concerned me about the programme is that is portrays animals in the wrong way. There was never any ambiguity that eating live invertebrates was abuse and also exploitation for entertainment.’</p>
