      <h1>A boy with a rare disease wasn't expected to live past 2. For his 3rd birthday, a parade was held in his honor.</h1>

      <p>Doctors told Nash Stineman's family he wouldn't live past his second birthday — but on Sunday, he celebrated his third.</p>
      <p>To mark the milestone, the family's community north of Chicago held a parade in his honor, <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/11/17/special-parade-held-for-3rd-birthday-of-boy-suffering-from-rare-neuromuscular-disease/">according to CBS station WBBM-TV</a>.</p>

      <p>Nash has a rare neuromuscular disease, spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress, which is known as SMARD.</p>
      <p>The disease — which has no cure and limited treatment options — causes infants to lose muscular functions like breathing and swallowing.</p>
      <p>Because of his weakened immune system, Nash is unable to have a party with other kids because he cannot be around many people.</p>

      <p>However, Nash is beating the odds, and his birthday parade received an outpouring of support. It included Jeeps, more than 100 trucks and police and fire department vehicles.</p>
      <p>As the parade route passed Nash's home in Lincolnshire, a Chicago suburb, neighbors, friends and residents left him gifts.</p>
      <p>"I will never be the same after this day," Nash's mom, Brittany Stineman, told CBS News. "This is the most amazing thing that has happened to my family."</p>

      <p>Stineman started the organization <a href="https://www.smashsmard.org/donate">SmashSMARD</a> to raise awareness and find a cure for her son's disease. The group has raised more than $2 million since February.</p>
      <p>She said a lot of people in her community had donated money for Nash but were never able to meet him in person because of his limited ability to be around others.</p>
      <p>"The birthday parade was a way of putting him out there without hurting him," she said.</p>
      <p>Nash's parade wasn't just about turning 3 years old — it was a celebration of a precious life.</p>
