      <h3>Prince Andrew Steps Back From Public Duties Amid Jeffrey Epstein Scandal</h3>
      <h4>'I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission,' he said.</h4>

      <p>'I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission,' he said.</p>
      <p><a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/jeffrey-epstein">Prince Andrew</a> announced on Wednesday that he is taking a step back from his public royal duties, saying that his reported association with alleged sex offender Jeffrey Epstein is becoming a distraction for the royal family, <a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-royals-andrew-duties/prince-andrew-halts-public-duties-over-sex-scandal-idINKBN1XU2D0"><i>Reuters</i></a> reports. The announcement comes following a disastrous interview in which he appeared to show little to no sympathy for Epstein’s alleged victims.</p>
      <p>“It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work,” the Duke of York said in a statement released Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Further, he noted that he sought the permission of his mother, the queen, to take some time off, and that she granted that permission.</p>
      <p>For decades, Prince Andrew was reported to be, at the very least, an associate of, if not a friend of, Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, who was accused of sexually trafficking and abusing underage girls, died in a prison cell earlier this year, by what has been reported a suicide.</p>
      <p>Just how strong Andrew’s association with Epstein remains a matter of debate. Virginia Roberts Giuffre has alleged in a civil suit filed in Florida that Epstein paid her £10,000 (about $13,000) to have sex with her, and that they did have sex on at least three occasions, including one when she was 17-years-old, according to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11359788/Prince-Andrew-under-renewed-pressure-to-speak-about-sex-abuse-claims-after-flight-logs-emerge.html"><i>The Telegraph</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Andrew has tried to distance himself from his purported connection with Epstein.</p>

      <p>Last week, as reported by <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5753095/prince-andrew-second-interview/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a>, the duke gave an interview to the BBC’s <i>Newsnight</i> program, during which Andrew seemingly failed to make his case. During the interview, described as “disastrous” by <i>Reuters</i>, Andrew gave “rambling” answers to questions about his association with Epstein. What’s more, he appeared to show little to no compassion to Epstein’s alleged victims.</p>
      <p>So bad was the interview that the duke was, at one time, reportedly angling for a do-over.</p>
      <p>Loading...</p>
      <p>In Wednesday’s statement, Andrew did what he apparently failed to do in last week’s interview: apologize and extend some sympathy to the alleged victims.</p>
      <p>“I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure,” he said.</p>
      <p>Andrew also left open the possibility that he would cooperate with law enforcement, should he be asked. As of this writing, the duke has not been charged with any crimes.</p>
