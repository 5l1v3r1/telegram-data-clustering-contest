      <p>The mother of late Cranberries singer Dolores O’Riordan has said she would have been thrilled to hear the band’s final album has been nominated for their first Grammy.</p>
      <p>The group’s In The End is up for best rock album at the 2020 awards.</p>
      <p>It was released earlier this year, and features vocals recorded by lead singer O’Riordan before her death in January 2018.</p>

      <p>Her mum Eileen O’Riordan said: “Dolores would be so happy with this, she put her heart and soul into her songs and music.</p>
      <p>“For us as her family it’s kind of bittersweet, we’re immensely proud yet saddened that she isn’t here to witness and enjoy this, although I feel that she is in spirit.”</p>
      <p>The Cranberries have said the album is a tribute to O’Riordan, who drowned in the bathtub of her London hotel room aged 46.</p>
      <p>Guitarist Noel Hogan said: “We wanted to finish this album for our dear friend and bandmate Dolores.</p>
      <p>“It’s a tribute to her, the band and our fans for the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>“Being honoured with this Grammy nomination has made this whole process even more special.”</p>
      <p>Drummer Fergal Lawler added: “We are extremely surprised and honoured to receive this Grammy nomination. We’re sure Dolores would be delighted.”</p>
      <p>The album was released in April by BMG.</p>
      <p>After its release, The Cranberries said they planned to take a “step back” before deciding whether they had a future together without O’Riordan.</p>
      <p>Alistair Norbury, president, Marketing &amp; Repertoire UK, said: “This is a very emotional moment for all of us at BMG.</p>
      <p>“We were so proud to have partnered with The Cranberries on the release of In The End and our shared aim was always to celebrate the life and work of Dolores.</p>
      <p>“For the band’s final album to receive their first Grammy nomination is the very best way to remember an iconic voice and honour a magnificent body of work.”</p>
