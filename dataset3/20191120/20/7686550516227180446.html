      <p>Jane McDonald appears to be the gift that keeps on giving in this year's <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here</a>, as she somehow led radio DJ, Adele, to scoffing a camel's anus during the first eating bushtucker trial of the series.</p>
      <p>The campmate, who <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/tv/im-celebrity-roman-kemps-confusion-17283316">has caused confusion with her luxury item this year</a> (a framed picture of Jane McDonald), imagined the former Loose Women host was by her side to support her through the gruelling challenge.</p>
      <p>Along with Roman, Adele took part in a trial called Just Desserts whereby the pair had to eat ten desserts on offer at the parlour.</p>
      <p>Each star they earned was worth a meal for their camp.</p>
      <p>The first dish was served to Roman, and was called Critter-Bocker Glory, which was made up of dead cockroaches, crickets and mealworms.</p>
      <p>Roman had to eat three of each.</p>
      <p>He started with the dead cockroaches saying that they were juicy and tasted a bit like eggs.</p>
      <p>He then ate three mealworms, and finished the dish with three crickets which he described as being "quite cheesy, cheesy eggs" and earnt one star for camp.</p>
      <p>Adele was then served Tirrama-spew, which was vomit fruit.</p>
      <p>"It's basically like eating a piece of fruit" said Dec.</p>
      <p>"Which tastes like vomit."</p>
      <p>Adele gagged and retched and said: "It's like your dog's been sick and you have to eat it".</p>
      <p>She swallowed and won her second star for camp.</p>

      <p>Next up Roman had to eat Licky Toffee Pudding which was duck's tongues.</p>
      <p>He had to eat three, and pretended they were calamari as he chewed and swallowed the tongues.</p>
      <p>Then Adele had to take on the Profiter-balls which were turkey testicles.</p>
      <p>She said that it was disgusting but Roman made her think of Christmas and they all ended up singing "The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year".</p>
      <p>Roman was then served Mississippi Udder Pie which was a cow's teat, before Adele had Piggy Pudding which was a pig's uterus.</p>
      <p>She chewed and said that it had popped.</p>
      <p>Roman's next dessert was 'Eye-full' which were fish eyes.</p>
      <p>"Don't use the word eyeball," said Roman as he swallowed making a total of seven stars.</p>
      <p>Adele's was then asked to eat Chocolate Gat-Toe.</p>
      <p>She made easy work of it which was a sheep's foot, taking their total to eight stars.</p>

      <p>Roman's final dish was Cocky Road Ice Cream - or a bull's penis.</p>
      <p>As the enormous penis was placed in front of him Ant asked if Roman could guess what animal it came from.</p>
      <p>"James Haskell?" replied Roman.</p>
      <p>"There's a dry bit in the middle" he complained as he chewed.</p>
      <p>Then Jane McDonald saved the day once more as Adele came face-to-face with Creme Poo-Lee - otherwise known as a camel's anus.</p>
      <p>She pretended Jane McDonald was there with her encouraging her and eventually swallowed the food.</p>
      <p>The pair got a full house bagging a whole ten stars for camp.</p>
