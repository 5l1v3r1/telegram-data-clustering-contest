      <p>Westpac has the wrap:</p>
      <blockquote><b>Event Wrap<br/></b><br/>Reuters reported that a <b>Phase One deal with China</b> may not happen this year, citing unnamed sources close to the negotiations.<br/><br/>The <b>FOMC minutes</b> of the 30 October meeting, where it cut by 25bp to 1.63%, confirmed that most members saw an ensuing on-hold stance as appropriate absent material surprises. Many officials saw downside risks as elevated, and that the rate cut was justified by low inflation, with several worried expectations could slide further.<br/><br/><b>FOMC member Brainard</b>, speaking to CNBC, said the Fed had taken insurance against the risks of a trade conflict. She’s seen some slowing in growth, but no more than expected, with trade uncertainty a major factor, while the consumer remains resilient. Her stance could be described as “wait and watch”. That said, she saw the balance of risks tilted to the downside, including trade conflicts and global slowing.<br/><br/><b>Event Outlook<br/></b><br/><b>Euro Area:</b> the <b>ECB minutes</b> of the October meeting are released. Given reported disagreement within the ECB on the recent September stimulus package, the diversity of views among members will be of particular interest. Nov <b>consumer confidence</b> is anticipated to increase to -7.3 from -7.6.<br/><br/><b>US</b>: Oct <b>existing home sales</b> are expected to rise 2.0%, reversing Sep’s decline. Nov <b>Phily Fed index</b> is seen to edge up to 6.0 from 5.6. <b>Fedspeak</b> involves <b>Mester</b> at a financial stability conference and <b>Kashkari</b> in Bloomington.</blockquote>
      <p>The trade non-deal is on the rocks. Via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-timing/phase-one-u-s-china-trade-deal-may-not-be-completed-this-year-trade-sources-idUSKBN1XU2C7?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=businessNews&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FbusinessNews+%28Business+News%29">Reuters</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Completion of a “phase one” U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the White House said, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.<br/><br/>U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an Oct. 11 news conference <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china/u-s-outlines-phase-1-trade-deal-with-china-suspends-october-tariff-hike-idUSKBN1WQ10X">here</a> that an initial trade deal could take as long as five weeks to ink.<br/><br/>Just over five weeks later, a deal is still elusive, and negotiations may be getting more complicated, trade experts and people briefed on the talks told Reuters.<br/><br/>Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer recognize that rolling back tariffs for a deal that fails to address core intellectual property and technology transfer issues will not be seen as a good deal for the United States, a person briefed on the matter said.</blockquote>
      <p>And CNBC:</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve been able to talk to four people close to the talks who suggest the deal is in trouble because there is not an agreement between the US and China — even at the stage — on which tariffs would go and which tariffs would stay. That there had been a proposal by China that any sort of tit-for-tat would need to be proportional, so anything the US removed China would remove but the US wants to China to remove more tariffs than the US is willing to remove on US goods and therein lies the problem.”<br/>Although one of these people close to talks suggests that the tariffs scheduled for December 15 are on track still to be shelved; that there’s still enough belief within the White House and the Presidents team that those should be averted at all costs. Of course the hardest part in this process has been selling the President on that argument.”</blockquote>

      <p>At what point does it become a problem for El Trumpo to deal with China with Dems crushing him from behind on Hong Kong heading into the election? Likewise for Xi Jinping and popular anger.</p>
      <p>The non-deal is already incredibly thin. Hong Kong adds huge risk. The AUD is a key proxy for both and can’t get off the canvas until we get clarity on it all.</p>
