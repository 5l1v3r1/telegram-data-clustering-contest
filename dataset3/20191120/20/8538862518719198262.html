      <p>Role-playing games cast a wide umbrella over the video game industry -- making for a genre that contains some of the very best titles of all time. No matter whether it comes from the east or the west, every experience brings with it something to call its own. The PlayStation 4 has seen some of the greatest RPGs over the past couple of years, including the likes of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/witcher_3_wild_hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/persona_5">Persona 5</a>, but what's next? What can we look forward to when it comes to creating a character and setting off into an entirely new world in the future? These are the best upcoming PS4 RPGs.</p>

      <p>We start with a showstopper. Five years in the making, Final Fantasy VII Remake finally arrives on PlayStation 4 in March 2020. Bringing with it the first part of the classic story, an all-new combat system ditches the original's turn-based nature alongside stunning visuals and an expanded Midgar that is sure to delight fans across the globe. This is the big one, and we can't wait to get our hands on it.</p>

      <p>Nioh 2 is the Souls-like to beat at the moment after a recent beta proved its worth in combat, style, variation, and deep RPG mechanics. This has more skill trees than you can shake a stick at, while a deep suite of character creation options seemingly allows you to create a Samurai to your tastes. It may be a dark horse when you take into account what's releasing around it, but Nioh 2 is surely set to impress those that give it a shot.</p>

      <p>The masters of the role-playing genre are back. After developing one of the best RPGs ever made in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and capitalizing on that launch with two rounds of incredible DLC, CD Projekt Red is back with one of 2020's most anticipated games. Cyberpunk 2077 has the potential to be one of the PS4's crowning achievements as various slices of gameplay and impressive trailers have proven its potential. If the Polish developer can back all of that up come April, then we're all in for a rather special ride.</p>

      <p>Trials of Mana is a remake of the 1995 Seiken Densetsu 3 -- a classic RPG that never made its way out of Japan. It's the sequel to <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>, which we're sure you've all heard of before. Just forget about that awful PS4 re-release, okay? Anyway, Trials of Mana brings the experience into the modern age with 4K visuals and an updated battle system. Not too much more is known about it, but with the experience hitting PS4 in late April, we don't have too long to wait.</p>

      <p>While it'll still be classed as an RPG overall, Marvel's Avengers will be an experience focused much more on the loot than its levelling up system. Of course, there will be one, but this is a title from Crystal Dynamics that's set to emulate <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/destiny">Destiny</a> more than anything else. With pieces of armour to collect, new weapons and mods to equip, and cosmetic skins to acquire, you'll be blasting your way to max level before you know it. Then the endgame begins -- one we're definitely interested in checking out in May 2020.</p>
