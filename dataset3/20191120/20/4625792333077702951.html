      <h1>'Hope I made you proud out there': Biden sends out post-debate email hours before event starts</h1>

      <p><b>ATLANTA — </b>Joe Biden asked supporters whether he made them proud during Wednesday night's debate before the former vice president had even walked out on stage to <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/democratic-party-raises-bar-for-november-debate-in-attempt-to-winnow-2020-field">face nine rival 2020 Democrats</a>.</p>
      <p>"I’m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now. I hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important," he wrote in a fundraising email Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>In the note, Biden, who celebrates his 77th birthday on Wednesday, as well as the existence of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hunter-biden-the-father-of-arkansas-womans-baby-dna-test-shows">a new grandchild</a>, took a jab at Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, in a line of attack he has used on the trail.</p>
      <p>"We need leadership. We need to be ready on day one to get the country back on track and clean up Donald Trump’s mess. But we need more than plans," the 36-year Delaware senator wrote, referring to his fellow front-runner's mantra, "I've got a plan for that."</p>
      <p>"We need the grit and the resolve to get things done," Biden wrote. "We need to reach across the aisle and demand that our leaders do what’s right. That we provide access to affordable health care. That we protect our planet. That we lead on the global stage again."</p>
      <p>The email's sentiments were echoed in a pre-debate briefing campaign aides held with reporters.</p>

      <p>Biden is expected to have a quieter night during the fifth primary debate, co-hosted by MSNBC and the <i>Washington Post </i>at Tyler Perry Studios. As the race's long-term leader, he was in his opponent's firing line during the earlier rounds. But as the contest tightens, Warren drew attacks last month when qualifying White House hopefuls were convened in Westerville, Ohio. Ascendant contender South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is speculated to bear the brunt of incoming in Atlanta.</p>
