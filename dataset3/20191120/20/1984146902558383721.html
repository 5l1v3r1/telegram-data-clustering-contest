      <p>Liam Gallagher made a young fan's dreams come true when he invited him backstage at a Newcastle gig after being wowed by the lad's singing.</p>
      <p>Eight-year-old Luca Flynn went viral when a video of him singing 'Wonderwall' onstage at an Oasis tribute band concert - complete with all the frontman's mannerisms - was viewed by thousands.</p>
      <p>The clip made its way to presenter Chris Moyles, who played it to Liam while interviewing him on his Radio X show.</p>
      <p>The singer loved it, and invited Luca and his whole family to join him backstage at his Newcastle show last Sunday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/killingworth">Killingworth</a> schoolboy Luca's mum Mandy said: "He's loved Oasis since he was about five. He heard Wonderwall on the radio in the car once and that was just it."</p>
      <p>The young fan's journey to meeting his hero began earlier this year when his parents Mandy and Graeme took him to see tribute band Oasish at a festival in Tynemouth.</p>
      <p>Mandy said: "I messaged the lead singer to say that if he got a chance to say hello to him, Luca would be thrilled.</p>
      <p>"He went one step further than that and when he saw Luca, invited him on stage and kept him up there as they played 'Stop crying your heart out'. While they were performing it Luca was singing very single word. People filmed it and it went a bit viral."</p>
      <p>About a month later, Luca went to see the band again and they invited him back up onstage - but this time let him perform solo.</p>

      <p>The crowd went mad for his version of Wonderwall, and soon a video made its way to the man himself when he appeared on Chris Moyles' Radio X show.</p>
      <p>Playing the clip of Luca singing with his hands behind his back, Moyles said: "He's even got your stance."</p>
      <p>Impressed Liam replied: "Go on, lad. You're amazing. Well done, man. He's cool."</p>
      <p>As the former Oasis frontman prepared to bring his solo tour to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> 's Utilita Arena, Mandy received a message from his manager and fiancee Debbie Gwyther.</p>

      <p>Mandy said: "She said Liam would love to meet Luca, so we all got put on the guest list and went backstage.</p>
      <p>"Liam said he'd seen Luca singing and told him he had a really good voice and was really cool. He even gave him a cuddle.</p>
      <p>"Luca saw an interview where Liam said he liked Yorkshire Tea and Rich Tea biscuits so he brought some, and some chocolates and an engagement card for Debbie.</p>
      <p>"He was so lovely and kind, so genuine. And to top it off he dedicated Wonderwall to Luca during the show.</p>
      <p>"Luca absolutely loved it - he was just in awe, he couldn't believe it was happening.</p>
      <p>"He can be quite shy but when he's singing he's a completely different person."</p>
