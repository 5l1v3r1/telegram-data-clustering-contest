      <h1>Natural Gas Storage Forecast: Third Bullish Report In 17 Weeks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:29:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:29</time> by <a rel="author">Bluegold Research</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This Thursday, we expect EIA to report 3,642 bcf of working gas in storage for the week ending November 15.</li>
        <li>We anticipate to see a draw of 90 bcf, which is 19 bcf smaller than a year ago but 58 bcf larger vs. the 5-year average.</li>
        <li>The latest numerical weather prediction models are projecting just about normal amount of TDDs over the next 15 days, but there is a disagreement in terms of scale.</li>
        <li>In the week ending November 22, we expect total supply-demand balance to be 6.2 bcf/d looser (vs. 2018).</li>
        <li>Annual storage "surplus" is projected to shrink over the next 45 days.</li>
      </ul>

        <b>The Weather</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Last week</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week (ending November 15), the number of heating degree days (HDDs) jumped by 32.6% w-o-w (from 125 to 166), as weather conditions continued to get colder across the Lower-48 states. Cooling demand has plunged by about 54.7% and remains too weak to have a meaningful impact on natural gas consumption. We estimate that total energy demand (as measured in total degree days, or TDDs) was approximately 4.0% below last year's level, but as much as 46.6% above the norm (see the chart below).</p>
      <p>
        <b>This week</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week (ending November 22), the weather conditions got warmer. We estimate that the number of nationwide HDDs will drop by 24.6% w-o-w (from 166 to 125), while the number of nationwide CDDs will rise by 7.0% (from 3 to 4). Total average daily demand for natural gas should be somewhere between 103 bcf/d and 107 bcf/d, which is approximately 17.1% above the 5-year average for this time of the year. Total energy demand (measured in TDDs) should be mostly within the norm, but as much as 20.3% below last year's level.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Next week</b>
      </p>
      <p>Next week (ending November 29), the weather conditions are expected to get colder. The number of CDDs is currently projected to drop by 41.7% w-o-w (from 4 to 2), while the number of HDDs should increase by 12.7% (from 125 to 141). Total energy demand (measured in TDDs) should remain within the norm. However, in annual terms, TDDs will decline by 7.9% due to base effects (last year, the weather conditions over the same period were colder).</p>

        <b>Total Supply-Demand Balance</b>
      </p>
      <p>On average, the latest numerical weather prediction models (Wednesday's short-range 00z runs) are showing just about normal amount of TDDs over the next 15 days (November 20-December 5), but TDDs are generally projected to trend higher. Total demand is expected to average 110.1 bcf/d (some 20.5% above the 5-year average), supported (in part) by strong exports - specifically into Mexico - and also by robust LNG sales.</p>
      <p>Projected HDDs are expected to remain slightly above the norm (on average), but there is a disagreement between the models (in terms of scale): GFS is significantly more bullish than ECMWF (see the table below).</p>

      </p>
      <p>Non-degree-day factors have a mostly bullish impact on natural gas consumption. We estimate that, at the current spread between natural gas and coal, coal-to-gas switching must be averaging approximately 5.6 bcf/d (1.5 bcf/d above last year's level). Additionally, nuclear outages and weaker hydro inflows are spurring some extra consumption in the Electric Power sector. However, stronger wind and solar generation are having a negative impact on the potential power burn. On balance, we estimate that non-degree-day factors are currently having a bullish impact on potential natural gas consumption (compared to the same period in 2018). We estimate the net impact to be around +2.7 bcf/d (+1.5 bcf/d vs. 2018).</p>
      <p>Overall, in the week ending November 22, we currently project that total balance will be looser (vs. the same week in 2018). However, we expect the balance to get slightly tighter in the week ending November 29 (see the table below).</p>

        <b>Storage Report</b>
      </p>
      <p>This week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration should report a larger change in natural gas storage compared to the previous week. We anticipate to see a draw of 90 bcf (3 bcf larger than the comparable figure in the ICE's latest report for the EIW-US EIA Financial Weekly Index, 19 bcf smaller than a year ago but 58 bcf larger vs. the 5-year average for this time of the year). A draw of 90 bcf would be the first draw this season and the third bullish storage change (relative to 5-year average) in 17 weeks (see the chart below).</p>
