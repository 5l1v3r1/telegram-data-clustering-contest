        <b>West Ham captain Mark Noble is hopeful of being fit to face Tottenham in Saturday’s London derby despite scans suggesting he was set for a spell on the sidelines.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mark-noble"><b>The 32-year-old</b></a> was forced from the field during his side’s 3-0 defeat at Burnley on 9th November, and it was initially thought that he would miss their next few games with a sprained ankle.</p>
      <p>However, there is growing confidence that Noble will be available to take his place at the heart of the Hammers’ midfield when they take on rivals Tottenham at the London Stadium this weekend – which will be <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/jose-mourinho-explains-tottenham-ambitions-after-succeeding-pochettino-on-big-money-deal"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>‘s first game in charge of Spurs.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/revealed-west-ham-scan-results-after-first-team-star-suffers-injury/?fbclid=IwAR3yXyXYKFwuV7vq5hSqFtePpdKivaBQnF5mt33cyAWebw3MDbLrBjxqcBo"><b>Football Insider</b></a>, Noble is ‘well placed to be given the all-clear for the fixture after making quick progress in his rehabilitation, news that will be a real boost to Manuel Pellegrini as he looks to put an end to their recent run of bad form.</p>
      <p>West Ham are without a win in their last seven games in all competitions and have not won in the Premier League since September.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to say that Noble will be monitored closely by West Ham’s medical staff during the week, but the Chilean coach is keen to include him in his line-up if possible.</p>
