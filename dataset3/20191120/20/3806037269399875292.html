      <p><b>UPDATE (November 20, 2019)</b>: Thanks to @solebyjc, we have another look at the purported Supreme x Nike Spring/Summer 2020 collaboration centered around the Air Cross Trainer 3 Low. This time, the “White/Pine Green/University Gold” edition has surfaced, presenting a bold counterpoint to the comparably muted green, red and black model revealed on November 19. The retro model retains the Supreme branding on the heel, along with an upper comprised of smooth leather panels. Check it out below.</p>

      <p><b>ORIGINAL STORY (November 19, 2019)</b>: After crafting an extravagant <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/supreme-nike-air-max-95-lux-info">Air Max 95 Lux priced at $500 USD</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/supreme">Supreme</a> has apparently teamed up once again with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike">Nike</a> for a bold low-cut take on the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-air-cross-trainer-3">Air Cross Trainer 3</a>. Not to be confused with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/bo-jackson">Bo Jackson</a>‘s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-air-trainer-3">Air Trainer 3</a>, the Air Cross Trainer 3 Low is a rarely-seen silhouette from Nike Sportswear’s ’90s archives that has remained absent from the market for a substantial amount of time.</p>

      <p>Thanks to @solebyJC, we have a first look at what the sneaker could be. Arriving in a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/gucci">Gucci</a>-esque “Black/Black/Gorge Green/University Red” the shoe features a full leather upper with panels both perforated and smooth. Bold colorblocking accents each piece of the heavily layered style. TPU overlays appear towards the bottom of the throat, and a large embossed Supreme graphic graces the heel. The two-tone midsole features three unique pieces, providing the versatile performance that made the Air Cross Trainer 3 an adept choice for everything from tennis to basketball. Reports also mention a “White/Pine Green/University Gold” makeup.</p>

      <p>This certainly isn’t the first time Nike has unearthed an archival design by way of a collaboration with Supreme. 2016 saw the beginning of renewed interest in the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2016/3/nikelab-supreme-x-air-max-98-collaboration">Air Max 98</a> thanks to a four-pack of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/prada">Prada</a>-inspired styles, and 2019’s relaunch of the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/2/supreme-nike-air-max-tailwind-iv-official-look">Air Max Tailwind IV</a> was kicked off by two boucle fabric-equipped Supreme iterations. However, this may be one of the most unexpected drops to date, as the Air Cross Trainer 3 hasn’t been seen in well over a decade.</p>
      <p>The Supreme x Nike Air Cross Trainer 3 Low is rumored to release in the spring of 2020. The MSRP is supposedly set at $130 USD.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more info/updates as they’re available.
