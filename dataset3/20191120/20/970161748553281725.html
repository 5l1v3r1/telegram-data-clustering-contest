      <p>A top Republican’s expression said everything viewers need to know about Wednesday’s bombshell impeachment testimony.</p>
      <p>Senator Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, was caught on camera glaring at his party’s lawyer, Steve Castor, after US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland’s explosive claims that ‘there was quid pro quo’ involving <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>As the hearing broke up for a recess, Nunes, who has been Trump’s fiercest defender during the proceedings, gave Castor a wide-eyed look that appeared to convey either anger, panic, frustration, shock – or all of the above.</p>
      <p>Sondland testified that he helped other US diplomats prepare a statement for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. It announced investigations into Trump’s political rival and 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, his son Hunter, natural gas firm Burisma, and debunked conspiracies that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election.</p>

      <p>‘The contents (of the statement for Zelensky) will hopefully make the boss  – the boss being the president – happy enough to authorize an invitation (to the White House),’ Sondland said.</p>

      <p>When the hearing picked back up, Nunes immediately slammed Democrats and belittled Sondland’s testimony.</p>
      <p>‘For those of you watching at home, that was not a bathroom break, that was actually a chance for the Democrats to go out and hold a press conference, ambassador (Sondland) for all the supposed bombshells that were in your opening testimony,’ Nunes said.</p>
      <p>‘I want to get back to the facts of the matter here and the thing that the Democrats have been unwilling to accept is that their operatives got campaign dirt from Ukrainians in the 2016 election…they know it’s true,’ Nunes continued.</p>
      <p>He then detailed a series of claims that have since been debunked but nonpartisan fact checkers, US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker, and former Trump homeland security adviser Tom Bossert.</p>
      <p>This was not the first dramatic performance seen by Nunes during the impeachment inquiry, which he has called a ‘pitiful finale’ to Democratic attempts to reverse the 2016 election.</p>
      <p>He has also refereed to the impeachment proceedings as an ‘impeachment sham,’ and called the hearings a ‘star chamber,’ while constantly talking about the ‘ratings’ of the televised hearing.</p>

      <p>Nunes brash remarks have drawn comparisons by some to Trump, who reacted to Sondland’s testimony, denying that he ‘knows Sondland very well,’ despite receiving a $1 million campaign donation from Sondland, who Trump named ambassador to the EU in July 2018</p>

      <p>When asked about Trump’s statement, Sondland said: ‘It really depends on what you mean by know well. We are not close friends. We have a professional, cordial working relationship.’</p>
      <p>Sondland reportedly said he spoke to Trump about 20 times.</p>
      <p>Trump spoke much differently about Sondland last month, when he tweeted: ‘I would love to send Ambassador Sondland, a really good man and great American, to testify.’</p>
      <p>‘But unfortunately he would be testifying before a totally compromised kangaroo court, where Republican’s rights have been taken away, and true facts are not allowed out for the public…..’</p>
