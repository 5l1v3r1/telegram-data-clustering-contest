      <h1>Gareth Bale accused of openly mocking Real Madrid as Wales star returns to Spain</h1>
      <h2>Wales captain Bale has angered supporters of his club, Real Madrid, and sections of Spanish media after leading his country to Euro 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:12:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/gareth-bale">Gareth Bale</a> faces a fresh barrage of criticism when he returns to Spain after being accused of mocking <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> in Wales’ Euro 2020 qualification party.</p>
      <p>The Welsh captain had already angered Madrid fans last week when he admitted he gets “more excited” playing for his country than his club.</p>
      <p>Real fans and the Spanish media then questioned Bale being fit for Wales’ crunch Euro 2020 qualifiers after not playing for them since October 5 due to a calf injury.</p>
      <p>Bale started both games to help Wales clinch automatic qualification as Ryan Giggs’ side beat Hungary 2-0 on Tuesday after three points in Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>Bale, 30, was later seen on the pitch at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> City Stadium laughing in a team picture behind a flag which stated: ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order’.</p>

      <p>It followed Predrag Mijatovic, the former Real striker, saying golf-mad Bale’s priorities are ‘Wales, golf and after that Real Madrid’.</p>
      <p>But the celebration pictures have gone down like a lead balloon in Spain, where boss Zinedine Zidane unsuccessfully tried this summer to offload Bale , who has two years left on more than £600,000 a week.</p>
      <p>It means Bale, who has scored a record 33 goals for Wales in 83 caps, can expect fresh flak on his return to Real, who host Sociedad on Saturday in La Liga.</p>
      <p>Spanish football TV presenter Josep Pedrerol , who has 1million followers, responded to a picture of the Bale and the flag on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> by stating: “Bale passes from Madrid. Confirmed.”</p>
      <p>After failing to shift Bale in the summer , Zidane has claimed he will stay at Bernabeu for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>But Chinese Super League side Jiangsu Suning could revive their interest in the ex-Spurs forward during the January transfer window after previously offering him a staggering £1m a week.</p>
