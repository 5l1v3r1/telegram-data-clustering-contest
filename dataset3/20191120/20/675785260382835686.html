      <p>Woman's Hour host Jane Garvey has said she wishes her ex-husband Adrian Chiles had stood up for women in the BBC gender pay gap row.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old presenter, who has daughters Evelyn, 19, and Sian, 16, with Radio Five Live host Chiles, organised a letter from 40 of the BBC's most prominent female stars calling on pay discrepancies to be addressed.</p>
      <p>She said: "Adrian has got two daughters, so he'd hate to be thought of as someone who doesn't understand the complexities of all this and wasn't onside.</p>
      <p>"It would have been really good if some of the high-profile male presenters, not necessarily those with daughters, had said, 'We back you. We get this.'"</p>

      <p>Garvey, who was with the 52-year-old presenter from 1998 to 2009, said: "If you're a white man in Britain, how much can you hope to understand the challenges of being a white woman?</p>
      <p>"Never mind a woman of colour or a disabled person? I'm still battling with it myself."</p>
      <p>She told the How To Fail with Â­Elizabeth Day podcast how brave her colleague Samira Ahmed had been for taking the BBC to a tribunal over pay.</p>

      <p>Garvey added: "I could have probably pursued a similar case but I just took a payrise... I didn't have the courage."</p>
