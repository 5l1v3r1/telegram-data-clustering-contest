      <p>Gov. Tony Evers has signed into law a measure that changes how electric bikes, or e-bikes, are regulated in a move designed to increase rider safety.</p>
      <p>The bikes with small rechargeable electric motors are gaining in popularity, creating some conflicts because current law treats them the same as old-fashioned gas-powered motor bikes.</p>
      <p>Under current law, e-bikes are banned from bike paths and operators must carry a valid driver's license.</p>
      <p>The increased popularity of e-bikes led to the effort to bring regulations into line with their use. The bill signed by Evers on Wednesday treats e-bikes like regular bikes, while also giving local governments the ability to restrict their use on some bike paths.</p>
      <p>Evers says he was happy to sign the bipartisan bill to support the use of e-bikes, which he called a "more sustainable and accessible transportation option."</p>
