      <p>Samsung has just <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-opens-up-oneui-2-0-beta-program-for-galaxy-note-9-owners-in-korea/">started the OneUI 2.0 Beta program for Galaxy Note 9</a> owners in South Korea. The new update gives us a hint about new features that may be coming to its upcoming devices.</p>
      <p>Famous leaker <i>Ice Universe</i> has found a hidden display setting, under which there are two options for display refresh rate, 60Hz, and 120Hz, in the OneUI 2.0 beta update. According to the famous leakster, the option new 120 Hz option is added for the upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone and not for any other existing Samsung smartphones, and if all goes well, the upcoming Galaxy S11 smartphone will feature a 120 Hz display.</p>

      <p>It’s not just Samsung that is currently working on 120 Hz display, tech giants including <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomi-reportedly-to-join-the-elite-group-of-smartphones-with-120hz-display/">Xiaomi</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-details-about-the-display-of-the-oneplus-8-pro-leaked-online/">OnePlus</a>, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/report-2020-iphone-will-feature-ipad-pro-like-promotion-120hz-display/">Apple</a> are reportedly in the process of making a smartphone with a 120Hz display. Currently, only Asus ROG Phone II and Razer Phone feature a 120 Hz display.</p>
      <p>Rumors are also doing the rounds that Galaxy S11 is going to set a new benchmark for other major players in the smartphone industry. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/more-details-about-the-camera-of-the-upcoming-galaxy-s11-leaks-online/">The smartphone will feature a huge 108MP camera sensor</a>, which will be capable of capturing 8K@30fps video. The company is also working on <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-camera-app-to-get-directors-view-mode-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-and-more/">plenty of new camera features</a> and these include Director’s View Mode, Night Hyperlapse, Single Take Photo, Vertical Panoramas, and custom filters.</p>
      <p>The S11 is also expected to be more pleasing to look at as bezel is going to be narrower than that of the Note 10 series of smartphones.</p>
      <p>Coming back to the display, Galaxy S11 is expected to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-galaxy-s11-leak-reveals-surprising-details-about-the-display/">feature a display with a weird 20:9 aspect ratio</a>, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10. This will make the display look a lot like the one you find on the Galaxy A70 and Galaxy A80 as both A70 and A80 have a similar aspect ratio.</p>
