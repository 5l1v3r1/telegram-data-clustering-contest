      <h1>Tory Lanez Thinks Young Thug Is “Responsible For 75 Percent Of The Rap Style That’s Going On Right Now”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:40:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:40</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Fu</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Young-thug">Young Thug</a>’s 2019 has been marked by a new level of mainstream recognition, from his first No. 1 album to a feature verse from <a href="https://genius.com/artists/J-cole">J. Cole</a> to a write-up on <a href="http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20191021-why-young-thug-is-the-21st-centurys-most-influential-rapper"><i>BBC News</i></a>. According to <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Tory-lanez">Tory Lanez</a>, however, the Atlanta innovator still isn’t getting the credit he deserves.</p>
      <p>“I think Thug is responsible for 75 percent of the rap style that’s going on right now,” Tory told Hot 97’s <i>Ebro in the Morning</i>. “I think it’s so important for him to shed light on it because of the fact that people just have been taking his style so blatantly and just not showing the respect or showing the ‘I got it from here,’ which nobody ever really wants to do ‘cause you never want to come out saying you got your sound from here, but at the same time, let’s be real.”</p>
      <p>Tory gave this take <a href="https://genius.com/a/tory-lanez-thinks-rap-music-is-in-a-horrible-place-due-to-repetitive-sounds-subject-matter">amidst a discussion about repetitive sounds</a> and subject matter in hip-hop. Ebro brought up Thug’s hit single, <a href="https://genius.com/Young-thug-hot-lyrics">“Hot,”</a> in which the YSL Records founder calls out his peers for not crediting him and his protégés:</p>
      <blockquote>I’m sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies<br/>Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys</blockquote>
      <p>Tory continued by stressing the importance of crediting other artists for providing inspiration. As an example, the Canadian rapper brought up Compton native <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Roddy-ricch">Roddy Ricch</a>, who previously <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52980/title.tory-lanez-responds-to-roddy-ricchs-accusations-of-biting-ricch-forever">took issue with Tory</a> borrowing his <a href="https://genius.com/Roddy-ricch-ricch-forever-lyrics">“Ricch Forever”</a> beat on the <i>Fargo Fridays</i> track, <a href="https://genius.com/Tory-lanez-watch-for-your-soul-lyrics">“Watch For Your Soul.”</a></p>
      <p>“It’s like the time when I got into the issue with Roddy Ricch, and he was like, ‘Yo, I feel like you sound like me on the song,’” Tory explained. “At the end of the day, we all have a piece of something. I feel like there’s a heavy influence of Thugger’s style on Roddy Ricch’s music, but… he takes his own inflections and makes his music what it is. Thugger does the same and makes his music what it is, but we all take little things. To say we’re not inspired by each other or that we don’t take the inspiration from each other would be a lie.”</p>
      <p>Roddy is hardly the first artist to take issue with Tory over copying their style. In the past, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Drake">Drake</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Travis-scott">Travis Scott</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Eric-bellinger">Eric Bellinger</a> have all beefed with Tory for allegedly stealing their sound.</p>
      <p>Thug and Tory have a short history of working together. Both rappers appear on <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Zona-man">Zona Man</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Zona-man-grandma-house-lyrics">“Grandma House”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/6ix9ine">6ix9ine</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/6ix9ine-rondo-lyrics">“RONDO.”</a></p>
      <p>Genius previously illustrated the depth of Young Thug’s influence by testing fans on whether they could tell his voice apart from protégés such as <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lil-baby">Lil Baby</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Gunna">Gunna</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Lil-keed">Lil Keed</a>:</p>
