      <h2>CM raises question on BIS report authenticity; health minister claims water-borne diseases going up.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:00:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Delhi Chief Minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> Wednesday accused Union minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ram-vilas-paswan">Ram Vilas Paswan</a> of lying and deceiving people over the issue of water quality in the capital. The latest attack escalates the war of words over quality of water provided by the Delhi Jal Board, a department headed by Kejriwal, which broke out after a Bureau of Indian Standards report stated that Delhi’s water quality was the worst among 20 states. Earlier in the day, Paswan got the report hand-delivered to Kejriwal’s house, after the CM said he had not seen a copy of it.</p>
      <p>As per the report, shared by Paswan, 11 samples were picked up from different parts of the city and they failed on all 19 parameters, including taste, colour, odour and suspended solids.</p>

      <p>However, Kejriwal sought to highlight that one of the men from whose house the sample was apparently picked up has told reporters that he was satisfied with the quality of water at his Burari home.</p>

      <h3>Method questioned</h3>
      <p>As per Delhi Jal Board officials, the method of collecting samples adopted by BIS needs to be examined, since they were collected from people who already had complaints. “If you pick a sample from there, it is obvious it will fail tests. For a true picture, tests need to be randomised,” an official said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>The man, Deepak Kumar Roy, told reporters Wednesday that no one had picked up a sample from his house, and he had never complained of poor water quality. When <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> had contacted Roy Tuesday, he had said he was not interested in becoming part of any controversy, refusing to say anything more.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Kejriwal raised questions about the authenticity of the report and tweeted to Paswan: “Sir, you are saying a sample was picked up from this man’s house and it failed to clear the water quality test but he says that no sample was picked up from his house. He also said he is satisfied with the quality of water. Why did you lie? Why are you deceiving people despite being a union minister.”</p>
      <p>Kejriwal also alleged that in Nand Nagri, a sample was picked up from a household after the intervention of members of the Paswan-led Lok Janshakti Party.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan claimed the number of children suffering from water-borne diseases and being admitted to Delhi hospitals has gone up over the past few days. He also accused Kejriwal of playing politics over the issue, and said: “BIS is an autonomous body which maintains international standards. They have tested the samples impartially. Instead of maligning the report, Arvind Kejriwal should have taken immediate action but they only understand the politics of lies,” Dr Vardhan tweeted.</p>
      <p>The CM has already announced that 32 official have been appointed to pick samples from all over the city. On Wednesday, he said the Delhi government had nominated DJB V-C Dinesh Mohaniya and DJB member (water) Shalabh Kumar for a joint inspection with officials of BIS. Paswan, however, wrote back to Kejriwal and requested that Mohaniya be replaced by a government official as Mohaniya was a political leader and MLA.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, The Indian Express had spoken to four people from whose houses samples were picked up. Three said they had complained about quality before samples were picked up.</p>
