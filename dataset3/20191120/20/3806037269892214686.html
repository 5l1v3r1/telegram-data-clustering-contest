      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/carpenters-workshop-gallery">Carpenters Workshop Gallery</a> is partnering with boxing gym <a href="https://www.bxrlondon.com/">BXR London</a> for a charity auction, titled “LAMYLAND: What Are We Fighting For?” Ten punching bags from <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/michele-lamy">Michèle Lamy’s</a> installation <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/dysfunctional-venice-biennale-virgil-abloh-furniture">at the Venice Biennale</a> will go up for sale during Sotheby’s online auction later this month. Proceeds from the sale will go towards <a href="http://www.londoncommunityboxing.co.uk/">London Community Boxing</a>, a charity founded on the belief that sports act as a vehicle for personal development and social cohesion.</p>
      <p>For Lamy’s immersive boxing installation in Venice, she invited artists to create punch bags to initiate a conversation about “what we need to face, challenge and celebrate in our lives.” The <a href="https://www.carpentersworkshopgallery.com/artists/campana-brothers/">Campana Brothers</a> created their bag out of raffia — dried palm leaves that come from Brazilian forests and are used for indigenous housing — in hopes of raising awareness for nature and sustainability. Their bag, along with other designed by <a href="https://www.ateliervanlieshout.com/">Atelier Van Lieshout</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/connortingley/?hl=en">Connor Tingely</a>, <a href="https://www.carpentersworkshopgallery.com/artists/frederik-molenschot/">Frederik Molenschot</a> and more.</p>
      <p>“This installation was part of my ‘Lamyland’ project – called ‘Lamyland and not ‘Lamy’ because it’s always been about creating a space and platform for other people,” Michèle Lamy explains. “Boxing is a great metaphor for life and I wanted to ask people what they were fighting for. For me, fighting is not a bad word. It’s about believing in something and making it happen.”</p>
      <p>On November 27, BXR London will showcase two of the bags at a special event hosted by the boxing gym, Carpenters Workshop Gallery and Sotheby’s. The online auction will take place on <a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2019/lamyland-what-are-we-fighting-for">Sotheby’s website</a> between November 22 and December 2.</p>
