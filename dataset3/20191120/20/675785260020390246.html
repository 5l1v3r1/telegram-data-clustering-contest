      <h1>Lorraine Kelly shares miscarriage pain and 'struggles in life like anyone else'</h1>
      <h2>Telly favourite Lorraine Kelly summarises on life as she approaches her big birthday later this month and says she'd love to go on SAS: Who Dares Wins</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:57:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:57</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Harding, Gabrielle Fagan</a></address>
      <p>Unlike many of her ITV colleagues, Lorraine Kelly vows she’ll never eat a kangaroo’s nether regions in the jungle or dance with Anton du Beke. Or impress a panel with her baking.</p>
      <p>There is one exception to her blanket ban on reality TV, though.</p>
      <p>“The only one I’d love to go on is SAS: Who Dares Wins,” Lorraine says. “I think I’d be gritty enough to cope.”</p>
      <p>Lorraine turns 60 this month and that grittiness, and the love of husband Steve Smith, has got her through hard times.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had struggles just like everyone else,” admits the TV presenter, who has a daughter, Rosie, 25 with Steve.</p>
      <p>The couple weathered the tragedy of a miscarriage in 2001.</p>

      <p>“It was very hard,” recalls Lorraine. “We had very much wanted another baby but it wasn’t to be.”</p>
      <p>“I wanted to go back to work to get routine back, but I went far too soon.”</p>
      <p>And a few years ago Lorraine entered the menopause and struggled to cope.</p>
      <p>“It started when I was around 54 and got gradually worse until it was unbearable. I just wasn’t enjoying life and was constantly knackered.</p>

      <p>“I found it hard to get out of bed. I had to paint on a smile.”</p>
      <p>Eventually cameraman Steve told her to seek help and she went to TV health expert Dr Hilary Jones.</p>
      <p>“The hormonal imbalance had triggered anxiety,” reveals Lorraine. “It was such a relief to know what was wrong.”</p>
      <p>Steve’s support is key to Lorraine’s happiness, she admits.</p>

      <p>“I’ve been very lucky to find somebody that gets me, puts up with me and makes me laugh,” she says.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good man. We are a proper partnership which is totally equal – except he takes the bins out.”</p>

      <p>Now she has written a self-help book, Shine: Discover a Brighter You, in which she gives advice on everything from ageing to self-confidence.</p>
      <p>And she refuses to hanker after her youth, saying: “I’m proud to be 60. I have got a lot more comfortable in my skin.”</p>
