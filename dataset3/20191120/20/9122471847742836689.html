      <h1>AAC Commissioner Calls Out The CFB Playoff Selection Committee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T20:51:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>It’s no secret that the American Athletic Conference and the rest of the Group of Five conferences basically need a miracle to have a hope that one of their teams gets into the College Football Playoff in any given year.</p>
      <p>But AAC commissioner Mike Aresco has gotten tired of seeing the teams in his conference disrespected with each College Football Playoff poll.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview, Aresco said he questions the “methodology” and “conclusions” that the selection committee makes in their decision. He ultimately feels that the AAC and Group of Five are fighting a “double standard” in evaluating their teams.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28123872/aac-commissioner-upset-double-standard-college-football-playoff-rankings">ESPN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“Each time I’ve watched the release of the rankings, I’ve seen an unfortunate predictability, and why wouldn’t I be upset? I’m not criticizing the committee personally, I’ve never done that, but what I’m doing is I’m trying to take the committee to task on their methodology and their conclusions. I want to point out the facts. My feeling is this conference has been undervalued and disrespected since the CFP began.”<br/><br/>“We’ve been fighting what I think is a P5 preference We’ve been fighting it for years and we’re fighting now a double standard when it comes to evaluating G5 teams.”</blockquote>
      <p>The AAC currently has three one-loss teams: Cincinnati, SMU and Memphis. All of them have at least one win over a Power Five team, and only one has a Power Five loss.</p>
      <p>But even in the best possible campaigns from teams in the conference, it hasn’t led to College Football Playoff consideration.</p>
      <p>In 2017 UCF went 12-0, winning the AAC title, but did not get into the Playoff over four one-loss teams. They ultimately proved their worth by upsetting Auburn in the Peach Bowl to finish 13-0.</p>
      <p>UCF replicated the feat in 2018, going 13-0 with an AAC title, but were once again snubbed. This time, though, they lost in the Fiesta Bowl to LSU.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the outcome in the Fiesta Bowl, if a Group of Five team can win 25 games in a row and still not get CFP consideration, that lends a lot of weight to Aresco’s claim of a double-standard.</p>
