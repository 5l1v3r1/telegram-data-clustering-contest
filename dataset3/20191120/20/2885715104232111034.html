      <p>Starting Thursday, a penalty would be imposed on officials of land-owning agencies which have vacant plots with either construction and demolition waste or garbage dumped in them, officials said Wednesday. The decision was taken at a meeting of the heads of various Delhi government departments and municipal bodies and was chaired by Chief Secretary Vijay Kumar Dev.</p>
      <p>Officials said MCD deputy commissioners from all zones would lead teams to identify such vacant plots. “The officer concerned of the agency, in whose area the vacant plot exists, will be penalised based on the scale of the damage caused,” a senior Delhi government official said.</p>
      <p>Authorities said they are planning to start penalising “visibly polluting vehicles” from Thursday. “All vehicles, including two-, three- and four-wheelers, which are seen to be visibly polluting, will be fined,” the official added.</p>
      <p>Officials said action is being taken after a recent Supreme Court order directed authorities to step up pollution control measures. An action plan to control high concentration of pollutants in the air during winter months would also be finalised in the next few days, officials added.</p>
      <p>The SC had directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) on November 15 to conduct checking of three-wheeler vehicles as well as those used by corporations to find out the kind of fuel being used, after a complaint alleged use of kerosene.</p>
      <p>The DPCC had sent samples for checking from 209 vehicles. The results of 20 were received recently, and as per the official, all 20 vehicles passed the test.</p>
