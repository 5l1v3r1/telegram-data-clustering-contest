      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/noel-gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a> has shared the official video for recent single ‘Wandering Star’, featuring <i>This Is England</i> actor Stephen Graham.</p>
      <p>Released last week (November 14), the latest offering from Gallagher will appear on his upcoming <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds">High Flying Birds</a> EP ‘Blue Moon Rising’. The collection is set to arrive on March 6 and follows on from September’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/noel-gallagher-high-flying-birds-this-is-the-place-ep">This Is The Place</a>‘.</p>

      <p>In the festive clip for ‘Wandering Star’, <i>The Irishman</i> actor Graham portrays a cigarette-smoking Santa who helps a mother (played by his wife and fellow actor Hannah Walters) steal Christmas presents for her children.</p>
      <p>After distracting a local shop’s security guard, Graham and Walters flee from the scene. Later, they make their way through London streets and offer a gift to a homeless man. The mother then returns home to see her kids as Santa watches on.</p>

      <p>Speaking of the video’s message, director Dan Cadan explained that the clip isn’t “anti-Christmas”, adding that he “wanted to highlight the plight that can affect people” around the festive period.</p>
      <p>“The pressures from commercial bombardment and a consumerist society, for a single-parent who will stop at nothing to ensure their kids feel the magic that so many take for granted,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Stevie G is my muse and this is our third collaboration, my second with his incredibly talented wife Hannah Walters and they brought more to this than we could have dreamed – which is part of the package when working with these two actors.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Their performances bring further to life Noel’s brilliant music and lyrics and we hope this fills you with Christmas cheer, and strikes chord enough for you to raise a glass to those less fortunate but equally as deserving.”</p>
      <p>Gallagher, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-reveals-aim-to-play-guitar-if-the-smiths-ever-reunite-2569869#SPI36jt06FhIqbDR.99">revealed he’d be up for playing the guitar in The Smiths</a> should the Manchester icons ever reform.</p>
