      <p>The Federal Executive Council on Wednesday approved that 500 million Euro loan be sourced for the Bank of Industry from external creditors.</p>
      <p>This was disclosed by the Minister of State Finance, Clement Agba, at the end of FEC meeting presided over by President Muhammadu at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p>
      <p>According to him, the loan is to support industrialisation and agriculture, which will create up to 1.2 million new jobs.</p>
      <p>“The credit guarantee is for up to five years and the Federal Government is the guarantor of the loan,” he stated.</p>
      <p>The Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, also informed State House correspondents that the council approved a Justice Sector Policy for the country essentially to reform the sector by simplifying access to justice.</p>

      <p>The policy, he said, would ensure “speedy determination of justice”, “quality of justice” and “access to justice.”</p>
      <p>He said the council also approved a memo seeking to repeal the Geneva Convention and re-enact it to “accord greater access to justice by prisoners of war.”</p>
      <p>According to him, Nigeria was lagging behind the rest of the world in terms of certain rights and privileges for prisoners of war</p>
