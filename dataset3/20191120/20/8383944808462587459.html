      <p>Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu criticized the European Parliament President David Sassoli over European Union's "insincerity, hypocrisy" and said that he distorted content of their meeting that took place late Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"In a meeting with Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, Turkey Foreign Affairs Minister, I reiterated the EU's strong condemnation of Turkish military intervention in northeast Syria. It is an unacceptable violation of international law that undermines the stability and security of the region," Sassoli said in a tweet, which would draw a quick response from the Turkish top diplomat.</p>
      <p>"Here is another example of insincerity and hypocrisy of the EU. The President of the European Parliament shared topics that were not said to my face. Appalled that the person who represents the European peoples distorts the content of the meeting," Çavuşoğlu replied to Sassoli's tweet.</p>
      <p>Çavuşoğlu also met with his U.K. counterpart Dominic Raab and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at the sidelines of the ongoing NATO Foreign Ministers meeting.</p>
      <p>On his meeting with President of EU Parliament, Sassoli, Cavusoglu said that their meeting was longer than expected as they discussed various issues including Syria, migration, Cyprus and fight against terrorism.</p>
      <p>"Terrorists including PKK members as well as FETO members are teeming in EU Parliament and we have shared our opinion on this issue with him," he said.</p>
