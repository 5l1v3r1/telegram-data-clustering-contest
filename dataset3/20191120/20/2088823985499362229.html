      <h1>IDA proposal would keep names of delinquent borrowers secret</h1>

      <p>The identities of companies that fall more than three months behind on their loan payments to an Erie County Industrial Development Agency affiliate would remain secret until the agency takes legal action against them, according to a new policy under consideration by the organization.</p>
      <p>The proposed policy, which has not yet been adopted, was developed after two months of discussion by officials at the IDA's Regional Development Corp. affiliate in response to criticism by County Executive Mark Poloncarz about the secrecy surrounding the businesses that are several months late in their loan payments.</p>
      <p>Under the proposed policy, agency officials would publicly note that a loan is past due after payments are more than 90 days in arrears, but the company would not be identified unless the Regional Development Corp. has initiated legal action against the business, most likely in an attempt to recover as much of the loan as possible by gaining control of collateral that has been pledged against the loan.</p>
      <p>The agency currently does not identify delinquent borrowers or those that default in its publicly available reports. Poloncarz, who pushed the ECIDA to adopt policies to claw back tax breaks from businesses that don't meet their employment promises, pushed the Regional Development Corp. in September to publicly identify the businesses that fall behind.</p>
      <p>Agency officials say they are walking a fine line between their role safeguarding a publicly funded loan fund and not wanting to cause harm to the reputation of a business that may be experiencing a temporary cash crunch, rather than a long-term financial problem.</p>
      <p>"We're just trying to be fair," said Joseph Emminger, the Town of Tonawanda supervisor who serves as chairman of the Regional Development Corp.'s loan committee. "We don't want to be punitive to the companies that just may be having some short-term woes."</p>
      <p>Poloncarz, however, said the policy under consideration doesn't go far enough to safeguard the taxpayer money in a loan fund that relies on companies repaying their loans so money is available for future loans to other businesses. If enough businesses don't repay their loans, the loan fund ultimately will run out of money, he warned.</p>
      <p>"I'm still concerned," Poloncarz said. "I still don't feel like this is the best answer."</p>
      <p>Poloncarz first raised the issue of identifying delinquent borrowers two months ago, after the Regional Development Corp.'s loan delinquency rate spiked to 14% in September from 5.2% in August. The spike was caused by one large loan that fell more than 30 days delinquent, leading to aÂ  nearly $1.7 million increase in past-due balances.</p>
      <p>Since then, the number of delinquent loans has dropped to two during November from four in September, for a 2.4% delinquency rate. The two delinquent loans,with an outstanding balance of $293,000, have payments of more than $88,000 that are past due. One of the loans has been delinquent for a year.</p>
      <p>The agency, which did not release a loan delinquency report at its October meeting as it normally does, provided a few more details in its November report, released Wednesday, including the outstanding balances and the amount past due on each delinquent loan, as well as how long the payments have been past due. The agency did not identify either of the delinquent borrowers, including the one for $250,000 that was a year or more in arrears.</p>
      <p>Steven Weathers, the IDA's president and CEO, said the Regional Development Corp. is taking steps that would allow it to sell equipment that has been pledged against the $250,000 loan.</p>
      <p>"It's possible someone could be delinquent for years and never be identified," Poloncarz said. "I understand the 90-day period. That probably is appropriate. It gives them time to address the issue."</p>
      <p>Weathers said publicly identifying delinquent borrowers could make their difficult financial situation even worse.</p>
      <p>"If I work for you and I read about that in the paper, I'm probably looking for another job," he said. "If I'm a supplier, I'm probably putting you on cash-on-demand."</p>
