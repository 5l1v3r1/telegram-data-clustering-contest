    <meta property="og:description" content="You might have seen the recent headline that 11,000 scientists endorsed a report calling for the world to “implement massive energy efficiency and conservation practices.” The study, “World Scientists’ Warning of a Climate Emergency,” is the first time a large group of scientists has formally stated that climate change is a crisis. Regardless of whether you are a climate-change believer or skeptic, we can all agree that human activity — particularly pollution of all kinds — is a dire dilemma for the health of the environment and for all of us."/>
