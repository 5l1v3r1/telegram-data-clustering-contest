      <p>A dog was so hungry she chewed off her own leg after being left chained in a garden without food.</p>
      <p>The animal, called Zoe, was spotted by a UPS driver in Exeter, New York last week, who contacted police with his concerns.</p>
      <p>Officers from the Susquehanna Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals responded, and deemed Zoe’s injuries so serious that a vet was called.</p>
      <p>Zoe was rushed to the clinic, where a surgical procedure found bone fragments in her stomach believed to have come from her own leg.</p>
      <p>The dog was kept in her spot by chain attached to a stake driven into the ground.</p>
      <p>She is believed to have been living in a pet carrier with hay in the bottom of it.</p>

      <p>Police did not see any food in Zoe’s vicinity, and say a nearby bowl was frozen and covered in snow.</p>
      <p>The dog was taken to Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine for more care, WIVB reported.</p>
      <p>She was found to have other injuries including scarred ear tips.</p>
      <p>Her owner Carl Pritchard has been charged with overdriving, torturing and injuring animals.</p>
      <p>He faces further charges of failure to provide proper sustenance and failure to provide appropriate shelter for a dog left outdoors.</p>
      <p>Pritchard, 59, has since surrendered ownership of Zoe and will appear in court on December 4.</p>
      <p>The dog is set to be put up for adoption once she has recovered from her ordeal.</p>
