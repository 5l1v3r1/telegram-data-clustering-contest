      <h1>It didn't take long for Disney+ passwords to be stolen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:24:30+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/marcus-gilmer/" target="_blank">Marcus Gilmer</a></address>
      <p>In case you needed a reminder that you should <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/04/yahoo-throw-your-old-password-away/"><i>never, ever, ever</i> re-use passwords</a>, a slew of Disney+ passwords were <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">already available to buy</a> on various forums mere hours after the streaming platform's debut. </p>
      <p>Users complained about their passwords being changed, depriving them of <a href="https://mashable.com/article/baby-yoda-memes/">that sweet Baby Yoda content</a>.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDNet reports</a> that passwords were up for sale for prices ranging from, well, free to upwards of $11. </p>

      <p>ZDNet notes that some users they spoke with said they had reused passwords from other logins which, come on, is one of the first rules of internet security. <a href="https://mashable.com/article/most-common-passwords-2018/">Don't use "password"</a> as your password and use different passwords for different accounts. </p>
      <p>In its story, ZDNet stresses the speed with which these passwords hit the web was quite startling, probably due to the high number of people who took advantage of pre-order offers and bundles.</p>
      <p>That streaming platform passwords are <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/12/12/netflix-account-sharing-stopped/">floating around the internet</a> is hardly a surprise. Given the level of password sharing and reusing, it's honestly to be expected at this point.</p>
      <p>In a statement sent to Mashable, a Disney spokesperson said, “We have found no evidence of a security breach. Billions of usernames and passwords leaked from previous breaches at other companies, pre-dating the launch of Disney+, are being sold on the web. We continuously audit our security systems and when we find an attempted suspicious login we proactively lock the associated user account and direct the user to select a new password. We have seen a very small percentage of users in this situation and encourage any users who are having these kind of issues to reach out to our customer support so we can help them.”</p>
      <p>So, please, <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/10/04/yahoo-throw-your-old-password-away/">be sure to stay on top of the latest password hints and tips</a> and, for goodness sake, stop reusing old passwords.</p>
