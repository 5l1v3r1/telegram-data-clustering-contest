      <h1>NAB to pay compensation to customers sold junk insurance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:04:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/" target="_blank">ABC</a></address>
      <p>The National Australia Bank (NAB) has agreed to pay $49.5 million in compensation to tens of thousands of customers who were sold junk credit card and personal loan insurance.</p>
      <p>The bank, and its subsidiary MLC Limited, have settled a class action taken against them in the Federal Court.</p>
      <p>The amount to be paid to each customer is still to be worked out, but the court hopes they will be notified by Christmas if they will receive a payout.</p>
      <p>The action, taken by law firm Slater and Gordon, alleged NAB and MLC engaged in unconscionable conduct in selling consumer credit insurance (CCI) to customers.</p>
      <p>They included pensioners, casual workers, and unemployed and critically ill people who were ineligible to claim or unlikely to benefit from the policies.</p>
      <p>It was also alleged NAB engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct when selling the insurance.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the corporate regulator gave a scathing assessment of CCI policies offered in Australia, finding they were “extremely poor value for money”.</p>
      <p>On average, customers only received 11 cents for every dollar spent on CCI premiums linked to their credit cards, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) revealed in its July report.</p>
      <p>CCI policies offer to provide payouts to help cover loan or credit card repayments if someone is sick, injured or loses their job and cannot meet the minimum repayments.</p>
      <p>The regulator scrutinised all CCI products – including mortgages and personal loans – offered by Australia’s 11 biggest banks and lenders, including Westpac, ANZ, NAB and the Commonwealth Bank/Bankwest.</p>
      <p>Last November, the selling of junk CCI came under sharp criticism at the banking royal commission — in particular, cold call selling of the products.</p>
