      <p>An ambitious plan to revitalise Cambuslang has been approved by South Lanarkshire Council.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Cambuslang</a> town centre strategy and action plan includes a range of short and long-term proposals which collectively aim to make the town more attractive to residents, visitors and businesses.</p>
      <p>Developed by the town’s community council in partnership with the local authority, the plan was last week rubber stamped by the council’s community and enterprise resources committee following a consultation.</p>
      <p>Improved parking, spruced-up shop fronts, community events and a strategy to attract new business are just some of the proposals outlined in the plan which will now be implemented in phases.</p>
      <p>John Bachtler, chairman of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/plan-regenerate-cambuslang-main-street-16262605">Cambuslang Community Council</a> , said: “This is an important step forward.</p>
      <p>“Our Cambuslang Future group has been negotiating with South Lanarkshire Council for over 18 months to develop the strategy document and we are delighted that it’s been approved. We are now looking forward to implementing the strategy.</p>
      <p>“The consultation with the community over the summer and online and at events like Summerfest, shows how much local people and businesses want to see improvements to the town centre, to have a Main Street that attracts shoppers and provides a focus for civic pride.</p>
      <p>“The town strategy has been modified to reflect these priorities.”</p>

      <p>The first phase of physical improvements to the Main Street will see the pavement between Greenlees Road and West Coats Road resurfaced, alongside improved street furniture and railings.</p>
      <p>It will cost £620,000 and has been funded by the Scottish Government’s town centre fund.</p>
      <p>Additional proposals, including plans for a civic plaza in the town, will form phase two of the proposed environmental works, which collectively will cost £1.4 million.</p>
      <p>John added: “Our recent award of £620,000 from the town centre fund is a good start on the physical appearance of the street, but it’s only the beginning.</p>
      <p>“We will need a lot more investment, not just from South Lanarkshire Council but from other sources like the Scottish Government and other funds.</p>
      <p>“Businesses will need to play their part and, most of all, the community need to support the shops and services in the town centre.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to the challenge and working with South Lanarkshire Council and others to bring improvements to Cambuslang.”</p>
      <p>Pauline Elliott, head of planning and economic development at the council, said: “This whole process has really helped us identify exactly what people who stay in Cambuslang want from their town centre, while also highlighting areas which can be improved.</p>
      <p>“As a council we might not always have the funding necessary for some of these ideas, but we believe that by working with local groups we are empowering them to look for alternative funding sources where appropriate.”</p>
