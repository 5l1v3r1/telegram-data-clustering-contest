      <p>Hey Shacknews, it's time for First Post! Let's officially kick off our day of posting. Please take a look.</p>

      <p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/superthom/status/1196893452182736898?s=21">ThomW</a>, for bringing this to my attention on Twitter. Most of these dumb kids today are too busy pooping their pants over a baby Yoda to even understand why this clip is great. Back in my day... Rassam Frassam...</p>

        <b>Bong Joon Ho on why he wouldn't direct a Marvel movie</b>

        <figcaption>Bong Joon Ho spoke with Variety about the smash hit Parasite and his intense dislike of tight clothing.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/parasite-bong-joon-ho-success-next-movies-marvel-netflix-1203408123/">Variety</a>, Parasite director Bong Joon Ho explained why he is not interested in superhero films:</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I have a personal problem. I respect the creativity that goes into superhero films, but in real life and in the movies, I can't stand people wearing tight-fitting clothes. I'll never wear something like that, and just seeing someone in tight clothes is mentally difficult. I don't know where to look, and I feel suffocated. Most superheroes wear tight suits, so I can never direct one. I don't think anyone will offer the project to me either. If there is a superhero who has a very boxy costume, maybe I can try."</i>
      </p>
      <p>I hope he ends up directing a movie about a super hero who wears cargo shorts and hoodies. Hopefully that wouldn't be too "mentally difficult." LOL.</p>

      <p>Our very own <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/chatty?id=39080886#item_39080886">ImageOmega</a> posted a video to the Shacknews Chatty yesterday, but I wanted to highlight it here on the First Post! This game is certainly proving to be very divisive, but I am enjoying my playthrough. I agree that it is a game that needs to be played to be properly judged, as watching a Twitch stream will not do it justice.</p>
