      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:33:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Adele Roberts' girlfriend has revealed the real reason the DJ brought a photo of Jane McDonald on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/big-brother/">Big Brother</a> contestant Adele, 40, surprised her campmates, fans and viewers by taking a framed picture of singer and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> presenter Jane, 56, into the jungle.</p>
      <p>She told the other celebs on the show she liked having Jane there for inspiration, but some of them, including <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-spat-over-jane-mcdonald/">DJ Roman Kemp, didn't understand the decision</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Now, Adele's girlfriend Kate Holderness has set the record straight once and for all.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, the actress explained exactly why Adele decided to bring a pic of Jane McDonald, telling her followers: "Hahaaaa! Right, I can clear this up! All the campmates have to have different luxury items, they're not allowed to double up on anything."</p>
      <aside>Adele chose something that never fails to cheer her up.</aside>
      <p>Adele first choice of luxury item, Kate said, was a family photo, but that option was already taken.</p>
      <p>"She didn't mind because she knew there'd be campmates who'd love a pic of their children in there with them. Second choice, a pillow, was another goner as it's usually the most requested item. Pretty much everything she wanted after that was already taken too."</p>

      <p>Kate explained that the brief from the I'm A Celeb team called for 'something to make you happy'.</p>
      <p>She continued: "[Adele] chose something that never fails to cheer her up and something that reminds her of early morning Radio 1 listeners â€“ it's a bit of a long running feature on Adele's show, when they're having a bit of a slump and feeling down a listener will request 'a bit of Jane' to get them through the day."</p>
      <p>Speaking further, Kate reminded her followers that as Adele presents BBC Radio 1's early breakfast show, many of her decisions "are made at 2am" and so "make perfect sense [at] that time".</p>

      <p>Fans of the show might have been surprised to see the photo of Jane initially, but it appears they're now full behind the decision - so much so that they're even calling for Jane to get involved.</p>
      <p>Viewers are desperate for the singer to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-beg-for-jane-mcdonald-to-meet-adele-on-the-bridge/">be the one to meet Adele on the bridge</a> when she eventually leaves the jungle.</p>
