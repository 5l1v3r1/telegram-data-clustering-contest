      <p>A man died following a horrific early morning crash. <br/>  <br/>The collision, at around 4am on Wednesday, took place on Moss Lane, Burscough when a white Audi A1 smashed into a wall, a telegraph pole and then a second wall.</p>
      <p>The car flipped over and ended up on its roof after the incident, which led to the A59 Moss Lane being closed.</p>
      <p>Firefighters battled to free the two people <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/car-flips-onto-roof-horrific-17285528">trapped in the car</a> .</p>
      <p>The driver, a 24-year-old man from the Sefton area, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>The front seat passenger, an 18-year-old man from Sefton, was taken to Aintree Hospital where he remains in a critical condition.</p>
      <p>Officers said they were keen to speak to any witnesses.</p>
      <p>Sgt Paul Maguire said: "Firstly my thoughts are with the family and friends of both of these men at this incredibly distressing time. We have specially trained officers supporting them.</p>
      <p>"I am asking anyone who saw the Audi and also the Abarth travelling in the area, or indeed the collision itself, to come forward. Similarly, if you have any dash cam footage that could assist our investigation, please make contact with us.</p>
      <p>"Lastly, I would like to directly appeal to the people who were in the Abarth to speak to the police. A man has died and another is extremely ill in hospital so it's important we find out exactly what happened."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information can call 101 quoting incident reference 114 of November 20th. <br/> </p>
