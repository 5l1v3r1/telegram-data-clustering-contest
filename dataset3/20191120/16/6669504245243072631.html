      <p>Quebec's auditor general is highlighting numerous shortcomings in the management of cases reported to the province's youth protection agency.</p>
      <p>In her annual report, Guylaine Leclerc notes the time between the reporting of a case and the taking of necessary measures can be up to 226 days in some regions.</p>
      <p>Leclerc warns that the longer the delay, the greater the risk children's development could be delayed or their safety threatened.</p>
      <p>She says the government needs to act quickly, as the number of cases reported to the agency continues to rise, which will lead to even longer wait times for services.</p>
      <p>Reported cases have jumped 27 per cent, from about 83,000 cases in 2013 to more than 105,000 in 2019.</p>
      <p>Every day, 289 new cases are reported to the Quebec agency.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 20, 2019.</p>
