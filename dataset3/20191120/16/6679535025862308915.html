      <p>MADURAI</p>
      <p>The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday quashed lower court proceedings against former Minister Natham R. Viswanathan.</p>
      <p>Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan allowed the petition filed by the former Minister, who sought to quash the proceedings pending before the Judicial Magistrate II in Dindigul.</p>
      <p>The complainant, A. Sabapathi, had alleged that the former Minister had failed to return the amount borrowed during the 2014 Lok Sabha election in full. Out of the ₹4.97 crore borrowed, only ₹2 crore was returned, he had claimed. However, Mr. Vishwanathan refuted the allegation.</p>
