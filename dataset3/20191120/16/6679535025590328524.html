      <h2>Action follows threat letter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:34:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Marri-Ramu-668/" target="_blank">Marri Ramu</a></address>
      <p>Security has been stepped up at different courts, including the Telangana High Court here, in the State following an anonymous letter threatening to attack one of those places.</p>
      <p>While police officials dismissed it as one of the dozens of anonymous letters received by them in various parts of the State day in and day out, security measures were reviewed at the HC building in Old City.</p>
      <p>A city police top official confirmed that an anonymous letter stating that an attack at one of the court buildings on the fringes of Hyderabad bordering Rangareddy district was being planned. DGP M. Mahender Reddy and Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar came to the HC on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>However, the DGP said the purpose of his visit to the HC was “not related to the threatening letter”. Special Protection Force (SPF) personnel are in charge of the security on the HC premises. On Wednesday morning, sniffer dog teams went around the nook and corner of HC premises looking out for suspicious objects.</p>
      <p>However, nothing suspicious was found in and around the HC building. Interestingly, an alert was circulated among the lawyers asking them to carry their personal identity cards for security reasons though specific reasons behind it were not explained.</p>
      <p>No specific information was available with the Charminar police in whose jurisdiction the HC premises is located. Unwilling to take any chances, sources in police said, security was beefed up at the residences of the judges at all places in and around the city.</p>
