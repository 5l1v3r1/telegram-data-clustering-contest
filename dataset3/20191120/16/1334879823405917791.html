        <h3>What Are SMART Goals?</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/759949/how-to-use-smart-goal">SMART Goals</a>
        </p>
        <p>refer to a way of writing down goals that follow a specific criteria. The earliest known use of the term was by George T. Doran in the November 1981 issue of Management Review, however, it is often associated with Peter Drucker’s management by objectives concept.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/853712/write-smart-goals-template#footnote_plugin_tooltip_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
        <p>SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. There are other variations where certain letters stand for other things such as “achievable” instead of attainable, and “realistic” instead of relevant.</p>
        <p>What separates a SMART goal from a non-SMART goal is that, while a non-SMART goal can be vague and ill-defined, a SMART goal is actionable and can get you results. It sets you up for success and gives you a clear focus to work towards.</p>
        <p>And with SMART goals comes a SMART goals template. So, how do you write according to this template?</p>
        <anchor name="how-to-write-smart-goals-using-a-smart-goals-template">
          <h3>How to Write Smart Goals Using a SMART Goals Template</h3>
          <p>For every idea or desire to come to fruition, it needs a plan in place to make it happen. And to get started on a plan, you need to set a goal for it.</p>
          <p>The beauty of writing goals according to a SMART goals template is that it can be applied to your personal or professional life.</p>
          <p>If it’s your job to establish goals for your team, then you know you have a lot of responsibility weighing on your shoulders. The outcome of whether or not your team accomplishes what’s expected of them can be hugely dependant on the goals you set for them. So, naturally, you want to get it right.</p>
          <p>On a personal level, setting goals for yourself is easy, but actually following through with them is the tricky part. According to a study by Mark Murphy about goal setting, participants who vividly described their goals were 1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to successfully achieve their goals.<a href="https://www.lifehack.org/853712/write-smart-goals-template#footnote_plugin_tooltip_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> Which goes to show that if you’re clear about your goals, you can have a higher chance of actually accomplishing them.</p>
          <p>Adhering to a SMART goals template can help you with writing clear goals. So, without further ado, here’s how to write SMART goals with a SMART goals template:</p>
          <anchor name="specific">
            <h4>Specific</h4>
            <p>First and foremost, your goal has to be specific. Be as clear and concise as possible because whether it’s your team or yourself, whoever has to carry out the objective needs to be able to determine exactly what it is they are required to do.</p>
            <p>To ensure your goal is as specific as it can be, consider the Ws:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Who</b> = who is involved in executing this goal?</li>
              <li><b>What</b> = what exactly do I want to accomplish?</li>
              <li><b>Where</b> = if there’s a fixed location, where will it happen?</li>
              <li><b>When</b> = when should it be done by? (more on deadline under “time-bound”)</li>
              <li><b>Why</b> = why do I want to achieve this?</li>
            </ul>
            <anchor name="measurable">
              <h4>Measurable</h4>
              <p>The only way to know whether or not your goal was successful is to ensure it is measurable. Adding numbers to a goal can help you or your team weigh up whether or not expectations were met and the outcome was triumphant.</p>
              <p>For example, “Go to the gym twice a week for the next six months” is a stronger goal to strive for than simply, “Go to the gym more often”.</p>
              <p>Setting milestone throughout your process can also help you to reassess progress as you go along.</p>
              <anchor name="attainable">
                <h4>Attainable</h4>
                <p>The next important thing to keep in mind when using a SMART goals template is to ensure your goal is attainable. It’s great to have big dreams but you want your goals to be within the realms of possibility, so that you have a higher chance of actually accomplishing them.</p>
                <p>But that doesn’t mean your goal shouldn’t be challenging. You want your goal to be achievable while at the same time test your skills.</p>
                <anchor name="relevant">
                  <h4>Relevant</h4>
                  <p>For obvious reasons, your goal has to be relevant. It has to align with business objectives or with your personal aspirations or else, what’s the point of doing it?</p>
                  <p>A SMART goal needs to be applicable and important to you, your team, or your overall business agenda. It needs to be able to steer you forward and motivate you to achieve it, which it can if it holds purpose to something you believe in.</p>
                  <anchor name="time-bound">
                    <h4>Time-Bound</h4>
                    <p>The last factor of the SMART goals template is time-bound (also known as “timely”). Your goal needs a deadline, because without one, it’s less likely to be accomplished.</p>
                    <p>A deadline provides a sense of urgency that can motivate you or your team to strive towards the end. The amount of time you allocate should be realistic. Don’t give yourself—or your team—only one week if it takes three weeks to actually complete it. You want to set a challenge but you don’t want to risk over stress or <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/813259/work-under-pressure">burn out</a>.</p>

                      <h3>Benefits of Using a SMART Goals Template</h3>
                      <p>Writing your goals following a SMART goals template provides you with a clearer focus. It communicates what the goal needs to achieve without any fuss.</p>
                      <p>With a clear aim, it can give you a better idea of what success is supposed to look like. It also makes it easier to monitor progress, so you’re aware whether or not you’re on the right path.</p>
                      <p>It can also make it easier to identify bottlenecks or missed targets while you’re delivering the goal. This gives you enough time to rectify any problems so you can get back on track.</p>
                      <anchor name="the-bottom-line">
                        <h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
                        <p>Writing goals is seemingly not a difficult thing to do. However, if you want it to be as effective as it can be, then there’s more to it than meets the eye.</p>
                        <p>By following a SMART goals template, you can establish a more concrete foundation of goal setting. It will ensure your goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound—attributes that cover the necessities of an effectively written goal.</p>
