      <h1>R.B.I. Baseball 20's Trailer Is Curiously Lacking In Gameplay Footage</h1>
      <h2>But hey, it's got lots of Christian Yelich!</h2>

      <p>It's fair to say that the <b>R.B.I. Baseball</b> series hasn't had the best run on Switch. We gave the 2017 edition was given a <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/r_b_i_baseball_17">scathing 3/10 review</a>, while R.B.I. Baseball 18 did little better, chalking up <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/r_b_i_baseball_18">4 out of 10</a>. Still, with last year's game improving enough to score <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/r_b_i_baseball_19">6/10 in our review</a>, there are reasons to be optimistic for the forthcoming <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r_b_i_baseball_20">R.B.I. Baseball 20</a></b>.</p>
      <p>However, having said that, the first trailer for the game has filled us with more than a little dread, as it doesn't feature a single frame of footage from the game itself. Instead, the trailer is solely focused on celebrating the talents of R.B.I. Baseball 20's cover star, Christian Yelich. The Milwaukee Brewers outfielder won the Gold Glove Award in 2014 and has bagged the Silver Slugger Award twice – once in 2016 and again in 2018. He was rated the National Baseball League's Most Valuable Player in 2018.</p>
      <p>In short, he's a fine figure to have gracing the cover of R.B.I. Baseball 20 – let's just hope the game lives up to his stature.</p>
