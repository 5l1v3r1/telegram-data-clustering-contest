      <h1>Why ‘A Star Is Born’ Is Grammys-Eligible This Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:35:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nylon.com/author/allison-stubblebine" target="_blank">Allison Stubblebine</a></address>
      <h3>No, you won't hear "Shallow" again</h3>
      <p><i>A Star Is Born </i>is going to be inescapable at yet another awards season. Despite having been released in 2018, on Wednesday, music from the film was up for three <a href="https://nylon.com/grammy-award-nominations-2020-list">2020 Grammy Awards nominations</a>, giving Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper a chance to add to the two gramophones they already took home last year.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Why is it up again? Believe it or not, the full soundtrack for <i>A Star Is Born </i>missed the 2019 Grammy deadline. Though Cooper and Gaga were still plenty visible at the show and nominated in four separate categories, it was all because of lead single "Shallow" — which was released on September 27, 2018, a few days ahead of the October 1 deadline, and went on to win Best Song Written For Visual Media and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance categories at the ceremony. The full soundtrack followed on October 5, making it eligible for this upcoming Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>So, now <i>A Star Is Born </i>has a chance at winning Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media. The other two categories the film has a shot at are the same as last year — Best Song Written For Visual Media and Song Of The Year — but rather than "Shallow," the heartbreaking final ballad "Always Remember Us This Way" is the standout track this year. But, will Gaga and Cooper <a href="https://nylon.com/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-rumors">reignite their theatrical romance onstage</a> for a final performance? We can only hope.</p>
