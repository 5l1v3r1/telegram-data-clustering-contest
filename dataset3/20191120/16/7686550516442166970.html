      <h1>Liverpool star Ben Woodburn's 'real low' at Sheffield United as new boss gives Reds message</h1>
      <h2>The young Liverpool winger endured a difficult spell at Bramall Lane</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Coleman</a></address>
      <p>Oxford United boss Karl Robinson believes Ben Woodburn's loan spell at Sheffield United came at the wrong time in his short career.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/inside-track-liverpool-youngster-ben-17275466">Speaking to the Blood Red podcast</a> at our sister publication the Liverpool Echo, Robinson says he didn't think twice about snapping up the youngster, who endured a difficult loan stint under Chris Wilder at the Blades.</p>
      <p>Woodburn, who rose to fame after breaking Michael Owen's record to become Liverpool's youngest ever scorer, played just 155 minutes of Championship football at Sheffield United last season, eventually cutting his stint short and returning to Anfield.</p>
      <p>The summer saw plenty of rumours over the 20-year-old's next move, and there were many eyebrows raised when it became clear he was ready to drop down into League One.</p>
      <p>Oxford were the team to win his signature and, despite only having one goal to his name for the club, Woodburn has begun to establish himself in Robinson's plans for the season, despite currently finding himself sidelined through injury.</p>
      <p>And the United boss, who actually worked with Woodburn as an academy coach at Anfield, admits that the player's morale was rock bottom when he arrived at the Kassam Stadium.</p>
      <p>He said: “He came to us on a real low this summer, after a difficult loan last year.</p>
      <p>“I think that loan he went on was too soon. I think people forget how young he is. The Championship is so unforgiving it’s incredible.</p>
      <p>“The style of play at that level is a little bit different to the Premier League, it’s more forceful in the way you get the ball through the thirds, certainly more aggressive out of possession.</p>

      <p>“When he came in the summer he knew they players I’ve worked with and, weirdly, I had him when he was at eight years of age when I was a coach at Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“So, when the opportunity arose it was a no-brainer for everybody: it was a no-brainer for Liverpool, the player and certainly a no-brainer for Oxford United."</p>
      <p>Despite his current injury, Robinson insists there have been plenty of positives from his spell at the club, adding that he even hopes to call upon the Welshman for the upcoming Carabao Cup clash with Manchester City.</p>
      <p>"When you look at this season he’s been really good, to the point he was one of the most fouled players in the league at one stage and took one tackle which ended up breaking his foot," he added.</p>

      <p>“Some people seem to think that’s okay that you can do that to young players but this injury will certainly make him a better player. Sometimes you have to deal with these situations to become a better player.</p>
      <p>“He was certainly getting treatment in our league that I felt wasn’t fair.</p>
      <p>“I think he was a marked man because of his reputation but he’s coped with it so well and Liverpool should be extremely proud of him.</p>
      <p>“We’re hoping in two weeks, he can come back down and finish off his rehabilitation and then hopefully ready and raring to go for our MK Dons and Man City games.”</p>
