      <p>A joint declaration of the 2019 Asia-Pacific Summit in Phnom Penh urged countries around the world to address climate change and put aside disputes to ensure global peace.</p>
      <p>The declaration which was issued on Tuesday evening also mentioned the necessity to focus more on issues concerning women, families and youths.</p>
      <p>“The summit [reached a consensus] that there are growing threats to global peace and security because of social, political and economic causes.</p>
      <p>“It also calls upon the world to acknowledge the importance of tolerance, mutual understanding, the role of civil societies, solution to disputes and world peace.</p>
      <p>“Besides, the media’s role in creating awareness on climate change and the importance of global peace should be recognised,” said the declaration.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the joint declaration said that long-lasting peace and happiness in society are the contributory factors of sustainable development.</p>
      <p>“More resources should be used to address issues on women, such as domestic violence, workplace discrimination, limited education and opportunities [to promote gender equality]. Also, youths should be taking up more leadership responsibilities to play a significant role in building a culture of peace.</p>
      <p>“Living in the interest of others is an effective means to overcome the divisive relations of humans and can pave the way for reconciliation to create one united global family.</p>
      <p>“In this sense, the summit emphasised the need to strengthen unilateral ties between countries in the Asia-Pacific so that the region can achieve its true potential in the international stage,” said the declaration.</p>
      <p>At the opening ceremony of the Asia-Pacific Summit on Tuesday, Prime Minister Hun Sen said: “As a [leader of the] Cambodian government, I would like to encourage the leadership of the government, civil societies and the private institutions to continue collaboration on addressing global issues.</p>
      <p>“These issues include extremist activities, climate change, cross-border crimes and human trafficking, cybersecurity, as well as economic, social, and gender inequality.”</p>
      <p>Social analyst Meas Nee said the world is concerned with the confrontation between superpower countries.</p>
      <p>“More countries have raised their concerns about a possible repeat of a political bloc divide similar to that of the Cold War era as a result of the confrontation,” he said.</p>
      <p>The concern should be given more emphasis to urge superpower countries to stop the confrontation and work towards reconciliation for global peace.</p>
      <p>“Without a collective voice, the confrontation can escalate into a “third world war” which would be the greatest scourge for mankind,” Nee said.</p>
