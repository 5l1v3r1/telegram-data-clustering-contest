      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Oklahoma-TCU</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>With its stirring come-from-behind win over Baylor last weekend, Oklahoma kept its Big 12 title hopes alive. The Sooners’ next test will be against TCU.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma hosts the Horned Frogs in the final home game of the regular season this Saturday night. It is the second of three straight primetime contests for OU.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly released his score predictions for Week 13, using his well-regarded SP+ formula. One of the games featured is Oklahoma-TCU.</p>
      <p>Connelly projects the Sooners will walk away with a 41-22 victory.</p>

      <p>Even after beating Baylor, Oklahoma only moved up one spot in the College Football Playoff rankings. The Sooners are in ninth, five spots away from the coveted top four.</p>
      <p>Barring some chaos, it looks like OU will be on the outside looking in at the playoff, even if the Sooners win out and win the Big 12. Things can always change, but there is no clear path for Lincoln Riley’s team.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the best Oklahoma can do is make things hard for the committee by finishing 12-1. They can take another step toward that goal by beating TCU on Saturday.</p>
