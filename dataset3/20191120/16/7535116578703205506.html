      <p>Almost every day we read about animals being abused being their owners or dying from their habitats being destoyed, which reduces our faith in humanity little by little. But, this woman‚Äôs love for an animal in danger just showed us that maybe we humans have some sort of kindness left in us.</p>
      <p>Australian bushfires are a frequent occurrence that cause a lot of structural and property damage. But, more importantly, a lot of animals also lose their lives. That was almost the case for this koala bear that was trapped in a massive fire and was struggling for its life before this angel in disguise saved the little marsupial. The woman rushed in despite the burning trees to rescue the animal in distress.</p>

      <p>The koala can be seen WAILING in pain! The woman wrapped the koala in her shirt and immediately poured some water on the poor animal to cool it down and soothe its burns.</p>

      <p>The koala was brought to the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital for further medical attention. This hospital was specifically built to treat the Australian animals that have been hurt by these incidents. Amazingly, even a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-thirsty-koalas-devastated-by-recent-fires">GoFundMe</a> page has been set up to treat all the injured koalas, and the campaign has accumulated over $800,000 (RM2,269,228.18)</p>

        <b>‚ÄúAny surviving koalas will be brought into the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital for assessment and treatment.‚Äù</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The woman, Toni, made a smart decision by dousing the koala with water as it reducing the risk of the koala dying from dehydration.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Toni did an amazing job by risking her life to save this koala bear. We desperately need more humans like her. Our thoughts and prayers go out those animals who were injured in this disaster.</i>
