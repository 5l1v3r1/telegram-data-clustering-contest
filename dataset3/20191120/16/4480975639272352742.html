      <h1>XAU/USD: Gold retreats from weekly highs, drops to $1465</h1>

      <p>Gold weakened from the highest level in almost two weeks slightly below $1480/oz and moved lower. <b>Recently it printed a fresh daily low at $1465, just cents above Tuesday’s low. </b></p>
      <p>The intraday bias points to the downside. Traders await the release of the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> minutes from the latest meeting that could trigger some <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/volatility">volatility</a>. Price action across financial markets remains calm with the US dollar rising modestly and bond yields steady. </p>
      <p>Equity prices in Wall Street are mostly lower showing little changes. The Dow Jones drops  0.25% and the S&amp;P 500 0.08%, affected by concerns on the impact on US/China trade talks of the recent Hong Kong resolution passed by the US Senate. Those concerns initially boosted XAU/USD to the $1480 area but then it reversed.</p>
      <h3>Technical outlook </h3>
      <p>In the short-term, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> is still moving with an upside bias, but the momentum is starting to favor the downside. Price needs to recover levels on top of $1472 in order to target again a test of the $1480 area. Above the next strong <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> is seen at $1490. </p>
      <p>On the flip side, a consolidation under $1464 would likely increase the bearish pressure ahead of the Asian session. The next support is located at $1455 (Nov 18 low) followed by $1445 (November low). </p>
