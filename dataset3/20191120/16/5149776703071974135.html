      <p>A man has been jailed for more than 10 years after admitting three separate incidents of rape, sexual assault and indecent assault against three girls under the age of 13.</p>
      <p>Ian Hudson, 50, formerly of Sheaf Place, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Worksop</a>, carried out the attacks in Nottinghamshire between 2004 and 2018.</p>
      <p>Following an investigation by Nottinghamshire Police, he was sentenced to a total of 10 years and one month in prison when he appeared at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottingham Crown Court</a> on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>Hudson was also placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for life and made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order indefinitely.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Kerry Peace, who led the investigation, said: "Hudson preyed on vulnerable young girls and the impact of offences like these are devastating for the victims.</p>
      <p>"I hope it gives them some comfort that he has now been locked up for a significant time."</p>
