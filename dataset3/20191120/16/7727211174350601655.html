      <h1>Everton striker joins Premier League outfit on trial</h1>
      <h2>Kieran Phillips scored 12 goals in 11 appearances for Everton under-23s last term and captained Paul Tait's side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sam-carroll/" target="_blank">Sam Carroll</a></address>
      <p>Everton under-23 striker Kieran Phillips has been allowed to join Sheffield United on trial.</p>
      <p>Phillips, 19, signed his first professional contract in the summer just three years after fears he would not walk again.</p>
      <p>The Yorkshire-born front-man suffered a double knee fracture that damaged both cartilage and bone and eventually spent 750 days on the treatment table with surgeons concerned his knee would collapse completely at one stage.</p>
      <p>Phillips made an impressive recovery, however, and returned for Paul Tait's under-18 side last season, scoring two goals in his full comeback outing against Wolves before adding a hat-trick in a win over Manchester City in September.</p>
      <h3>Everton news and transfers <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-transfer-gossip-news-live-17284631">LIVE</a> - Krzysztof Piatek and Moise Kean 'swap deal'</h3>
      <p>After eventually netting 12 goals in 11 appearances, the teenager penned a one-year extension to his current deal but has been allowed to trial with the Blades following just five-minutes of under-23 football at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>.</p>
      <p>Phillips joined up with the squad last week and netted in United's 3-3 draw with Bolton Wanderers U23s on Monday but it remains unclear whether he will feature in the mini-Steel City Derby against Sheffield Wednesday next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It is understood Everton are expecting the striker to find a new club on a permanent deal in January.</p>
