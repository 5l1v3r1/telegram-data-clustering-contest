        <b>The son of former German president Richard von Weizsäcker was killed after presenting a lecture at a Berlin hospital.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fritz von Weizsäcker, who worked as a doctor, had just delivered a lecture on liver diseases at the Schlosspark hospital in the western Berlin neighbourhood of Charlottenburg on Tuesday evening when he was stabbed, a police spokesman said. One other person was seriously injured.</p>
      <p>The 59-year-old, a father-of-four, died at the scene despite efforts to save him. The incident took place around 6.50pm.</p>
      <p>Around 20 people were in attendance at the lecture. The suspect was overpowered by the other people present, one of whom, said to be an off-duty policeman, was severely injured by the attacker.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said the 57-year-old attacker had bought the knife in his home state of Rhineland-Palatinate in the far west of Germany and travelled to Berlin by train.</p>
      <p>They said he had been diagnosed with an "acute mental illness" and had a "probably delusional general dislike" of the Weizsäcker family.</p>
      <p>Police tweeted about the "violent attack" on Tuesday night.</p>

      <p>Head of the pro-business FDP party, Christian Lindner, paid tribute to his friend on Twitter, calling him a "passionate doctor and a fine person". He voiced his grief, saying that "once again we ask ourselves what sort of world are we living in."</p>

      <p>His father, <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20150131/first-president-of-united-germany-dead">Richard von Weizsäcker</a>, was considered one of Germany's great post-war political figures.</p>
      <p>Spiegel magazine said the suspect had researched the elder Weizsäcker's role on the board of chemicals giant Böhringer Ingelheim during the 1960s before he began his political career.</p>
      <p>The company at the time reportedly supplied the United States with some of the chemicals in Agent Orange, a powerful defoliant used in the Vietnam War that caused severe health problems for humans exposed to it.</p>
      <p>Weizsäcker was president of West Germany from 1984 to 1990, and then held the same position in the united Germany from 1990 to 1994.</p>
      <p>He was previously a deputy in the lower house of parliament for the CDU now led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, and mayor of West Berlin. He died in 2015.</p>
      <p>Merkel said the killing was "a terrible moment for the von Weizsäcker family", her spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters.</p>
