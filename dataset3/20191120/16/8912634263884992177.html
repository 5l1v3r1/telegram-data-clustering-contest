      <p>BAGHDAD: Anti-government demonstrators in southern Iraq shut roads to two major ports and a key oil field Wednesday, port officials and AFP correspondents said, leading to a brief operational halt.<br/>Correspondent in oil-rich Basra province saw protesters block access routes to the ports of Khor Al-Zubair and Umm Qasr, as well as Rumailah oil field.<br/>Trucks waiting to load up goods from the ports could be seen waiting empty behind crowds of demonstrators.<br/>Khor Al-Zubair is used for some heavy crude exports but also to import fuel products like benzene, while Umm Qasr is the main entry point for food and medicine into Iraq.<br/>“Export and import activities have stopped because trucks cannot enter Khor Al-Zubair or Umm Qasr ports,” one official at Basra’s port authority said.<br/>A second official later said the route to Khor Al-Zubair had been reopened but Umm Qasr remained shut.<br/>Sit-ins have become a go-to tactic for Iraqis demonstrating against their government since early October.<br/>Protesters have shut the road to Umm Qasr several times, causing a delay in offloading operations that on one occasion forced around a dozen ships to unload their cargo in another country.<br/>Road closures have also impacted heavy crude from the Qayyarah field in northern Iraq from reaching Khor Al-Zubair since earlier this month.<br/>The prime minister’s office has warned security forces “will not allow” protesters near key infrastructure, and riot police have forced roads open in deadly crackdowns.<br/>More than 330 people have been killed since rallies erupted on October 1 in Baghdad and across the south.<br/>In the capital’s main protest camp of Tahrir (Liberation) Square, thousands gathered Wednesday to express their ongoing frustration.<br/>Top leaders and political parties have focused their efforts on hiring drives, more welfare and a new electoral law as immediate measures.<br/>Parliament met late Tuesday to discuss a draft voting law that proposes downsizing the house from 329 seats to 251, shrinking districts and distributing votes according to a complex hybrid system.<br/>But the United Nations mission in Iraq (UNAMI) said the draft law needed more work.<br/>“The draft electoral legislation — currently under review by the Council of Representatives — requires improvements to meet public demands,” it said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.<br/>UNAMI chief Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert urged lawmakers to pass legislation that “will reflect the public appetite for a new and different way of conducting politics.”<br/>Protesters have so far been unimpressed by the government’s proposals and large crowds — most of them students — turned out on Wednesday.<br/>“Last night’s session serves their own interests, not those of the people,” said Younes, a 28-year-old protester.<br/>Crowds have spilled over from Tahrir onto three main bridges that lead to the western bank of the Tigris, where key government buildings and embassies are based.<br/>On Tuesday night, they tried to cross two of the bridges to reach the so-called Green Zone but security forces deployed on the bridges fired tear gas to keep them back, a security source told AFP.</p>
