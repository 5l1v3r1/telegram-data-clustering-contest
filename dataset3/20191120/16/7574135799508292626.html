      <p>Poland-based experimental and electronic music festival <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/unsound-new-york-2019-lineup-tim-hecker-liz-harris-nivhek-the-bug-more/">Unsound</a> returns for its first NYC edition since 2016 on Saturday (11/23) at Knockdown Center, and since the <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/unsound-new-york-2019-lineup-tim-hecker-liz-harris-nivhek-the-bug-more/">lineup was revealed</a>, there have been a few changes to it. First off are a couple of big additions: producer, singer and songwriter <b>SOPHIE</b> and footwork great <b>Jlin</b> join the lineup, which also includes <b>Tim Hecker</b> with <b>The Konoyo Ensemble</b>, the US premiere Grouper’s Liz Harris’ project <b>Nivhek, Caterina Barbieri, The Bug,</b> and more.</p>
      <p><b>Amnesia Scanner</b> were originally supposed to play one of their first NYC sets in a while at the festival, but they’ve had to cancel their appearance, as they won’t be able to make it to the US. <b>Felicita &amp; Śląsk Song and Dance Ensemble</b>‘s performance, meanwhile, has been postponed until December 8 at Knockdown Center; more details still to come about that.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/unsound-new-york-tickets-77898980949">Tickets</a> to Unsound New York are on sale now, and there’s also a free opening concert on <b>November 22 at St. Peter’s Church in Chelsea</b>.</p>
