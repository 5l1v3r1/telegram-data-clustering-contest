      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned the post-election violence reported in Kogi State, which led to the death of a People’s Democratic Party (PDP) woman leader, Salome Abuh, and destruction of property in the state.</p>
      <p>The party, in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in Abuja on Wednesday, condoled with the family of the deceased and others affected by the post-election violence.</p>
      <p>Issa-Onilu, who quoted the state police command as saying that the killing was as a result of a reprisal attack, urged the Kogi people to ensure that the violence was not allowed to escalate.</p>
      <p>“We are aware that Gov. Yahaya Bello has already directed law enforcement agencies to fish out the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>“The APC abhors violence and other criminalities which, sadly, have continued to plague our electioneering process.</p>

      <p>“We urge people to see election as a democratic contest and not a do-or-die and for which we should pay with our lives.</p>
      <p>“We pray that the culprits are caught and the full weight of the law brought to bear on them.</p>
      <p>“President Muhammadu Buhari has advised those who are not satisfied with the results of the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa to seek redress in court and shun violence.</p>
      <p>“We must all heed this call,” the APC spokesman said.</p>
