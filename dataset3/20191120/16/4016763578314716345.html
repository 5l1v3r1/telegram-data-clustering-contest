      <h1>GoldLink: “It’s F*ck The Grammys ’Til The Day I Die”</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/Goldlink">GoldLink</a> isn’t happy about this year’s <a href="https://genius.com/a/here-are-all-the-2020-grammy-awards-nominations">crop of Grammy nominations</a>, which didn’t include his 2019 album, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Goldlink/Diaspora"><i>Diaspora</i></a>, and he made his displeasure known. In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Fy-yHgBpZ/">lengthy Instagram post</a>, the DC rapper rattled off a list of artists that he thinks deserve better from the awards show, including <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Tyler-the-creator">Tyler, The Creator</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Burna-boy">Burna Boy</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Koffee">Koffee</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Solange">Solange</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Dababy">DaBaby</a>.</p>
      <p>He also seemed to rule out trying to compete for Grammys in the future:</p>
      <blockquote>Honestly, its fuck Grammys til the day I die. I am no longer participating in that wild ass slave ass political ass cheating ass game any longer. The lack of relevance you have just solidified today is unbelievable. Tyler got one fuckin nomination in a category he didn’t even participate in knowing damn well he deserved album of the year. Burna Boy deserves more, Koffee deserves more. DaBaby couldn’t “qualify” for best new artist apparently because he had ‘mixtapes’ in the past. No nod to Solange for taking a risk pushing the boundaries when nobody else was brave enough to do so. There’s not even a category for internationally black artist at all. Wtf do you think these kids learn when you tell them there black art isn’t good enough? Or isn’t noticed at all? I’ve just gotten to a point after three years of being silent on this topic, that my value is much beyond what closed door establishments have been giving us. Even how our peers are voting against us. I cannot partake.</blockquote>
      <p>Tyler is nominated for Best Rap Album for his 2019 effort, <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Tyler-the-creator/Igor"><i>IGOR</i></a>. Koffee earned a Best Reggae Album nomination for <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Koffee/Rapture"><i>Rapture</i></a>, and Burna Boy’s <a href="https://genius.com/Burna-boy-african-giant-lyrics"><i>African Giant</i></a> netted him a Best World Music Album nomination. Although DaBaby won’t compete for Best New Artist (a category that’s <a href="https://genius.com/a/post-malone-cardi-b-are-reportedly-disqualified-from-the-best-new-artist-category-at-the-2019-grammy-awards">controversial every year</a> due to its subjective qualification criteria), he did earn nominations for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance.</p>
      <p>Out of all the artists he named, only <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Solange">Solange</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Solange/When-i-get-home"><i>When I Get Home</i></a> didn’t net any nominations. However, none of them will compete in the four major categories. <i>IGOR</i>’s omission from the Album of the Year category seems to have drawn the most controversy thus far.</p>
      <p>In a separate post on his Instagram Story, he wrote “<a href="https://genius.com/artists/Trippie-redd">Trippie Redd</a> honestly and truly deserves a Grammy nomination.” The Canton, Ohio rapper also isn’t among this year’s nominees.</p>
      <p>GoldLink has two career Grammy nominations under his belt. In 2018, he competed for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his hit single, <a href="https://genius.com/Goldlink-crew-lyrics">“Crew,”</a> and in 2019 he was nominated in the same category for his work on <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Christina-aguilera">Christina Aguilera</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/Christina-aguilera-like-i-do-lyrics">“Like I Do.”</a></p>
