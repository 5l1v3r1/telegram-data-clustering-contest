      <p>Ion Bucar, 29 and from Coventry, has been charged with aggravated vehicle taking and dangerous driving.</p>
      <p>Bucar was one of two men who were arrested after being tracked down by a police helicopter 29 miles away from where the police car was shunted.</p>
      <p>A second man, aged 23 and also from Coventry, has been released without charge.</p>
      <p>Bucar is believed to have been behind the wheel of a stolen BMW 1 Series which police tried to pull over in Upper Villiers Street, Wolverhampton, on Monday evening.</p>
      <p>According to police, the BMW was wearing cloned plates and rammed into officers before fleeing and eventually being spotted by the police helicopter heading into Coventry.</p>
      <p>It was tracked to Eld Road in the north of the city before two men abandoned the car and ran into Culworth Court, where they were arrested by response officers in a block of flats.</p>
      <p>Bucar, of Hampton Road, Edgwick, was due to appear before magistrates in Leamington Spa today.</p>
