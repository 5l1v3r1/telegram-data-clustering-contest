      <p>Jools Holland was the special guest at a party to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Nottingham's Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies.</p>
      <p>Joining him at the event last night (November 19), at Metronome, were BAFTA-winners Vicky McClure - a Confetti Ambassador - and Shane Meadows, along with industry guests, local dignitaries, former alumni and current staff and students.</p>
      <p>As well as marking the landmark for the hub, which has been nurturing talent for the creative industries such as film, TV, games and media since 1994, the inaugural Confetti Award was presented, designed to honour individuals who have "made an extraordinary and sustained contribution to raising the visibility of new creative talent."</p>
      <p>Founder and CEO of Confetti, Craig Chettle, announced the first recipient of this award was Jools Holland OBE and presented it to him during a tour of the music recording studios and facilities in Metronome, Confetti's live music and arts venue which opened last year.</p>

      <p>"I am honestly amazed at the mind-bogglingly brilliant facilities you have here," said Holland, who is performing at the Royal Concert Hall tonight (November 20).</p>
      <p>"The studios I have seen are better than any I have seen anywhere. And the students I met were so engaged because they love what they do. They have such great opportunities. I haven’t seen anything like this before and I am sure this place will soon be on the global map.”</p>
      <p>Performing at the event were former student and international beatboxer THePETEBOX, the Confetti House Band – comprising current Confetti students Grace Baker, Holly Taylor Gamble and former student Matt Burrows - while guests were treated to an impromptu rendition of Happy Birthday from Holland.</p>

      <p>The event also saw the unveiling of 25 Frames, a permanent 25-screen digital exhibition space within Metronome. On the night, it displayed student award-winners, the history of Confetti alongside significant cultural moments from around the world from the past 25 years.</p>
      <p>“It was an honour to stand up in front of hundreds of friends to talk about the impact Confetti has had over the past 25 years," said Craig Chettle.</p>
      <p>"From humble beginnings, we are now a leading provider of specialist education with a student body of over 2000. Our graduates are behind the scenes of Star Wars – the Last Skywalker and big games such as Grand Theft Auto. They are performing at venues all over the world and they start that journey with us.</p>
      <p>"We ensure real-world industry experiences are always on offer as well as academic study. Our 'Do it for Real' ethos underpins all activity."</p>

      <p>He added: "Creating authentic experiences and opportunities for our students has always been at the centre of everything we do. Whether that is crewing music festivals, making programmes for Notts TV or performing in our venue. We have always strived to ensure our students learn about the industry by being in it – being a part of it – and it was fantastic to see Jools Holland as well as our friends Shane Meadows and Vicky McClure here tonight to share in our company milestone."</p>
      <p>In 2015, Confetti became part of Nottingham Trent University. Since then there has been over £15m of development on the Confetti campus.</p>
