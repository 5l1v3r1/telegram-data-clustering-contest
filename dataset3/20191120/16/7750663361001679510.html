      <p>Reports in the summer suggested Forster's parent club <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/southampton/"><b>Southampton</b></a> had inserted a recall clause when they allowed the keeper to return to Glasgow on a one-year loan deal.</p>
      <p>But the 31-year-old has reassured the Celtic faithful he will be going nowhere in January.</p>
      <p>He said: "I don't think there's a recall (option), so I think I'm here for the season from my side of things.</p>
      <p>"I'm happy here and glad to be back here playing. I just want to do as well as I can so I think I'll be here for the season.</p>
      <p>"It's brilliant. When I had the opportunity to come back up I was glad that it was going to be for the season.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to be back here and I wanted to be playing.</p>
      <p>"I had a very hard 18 months before going back up where I wasn't playing for Southampton when I'd so used to playing. I think I played pretty much every game before then apart from when I was out injured.</p>
      <p>"I've had a good start to the season so I'm absolutely buzzing to be up here and making the most of it."</p>
      <p>Forster still has two-and-a-half years left on his Saints deal but has found game-time hard to come by at St Mary's after falling behind Angus Gunn and Alex McCarthy in boss Ralph Hasenhuttl's pecking order.</p>
      <p>The Hoops support would love to see the former England international return on a permanent deal, having seen him help Neil Lennon's side clinch a place in the last 32 of the Europa League with a string of crucial stops.</p>
      <p>But Forster says the decision is out of his hands.</p>
      <p>He said: "I'm only focusing on the short term really. So much of what will happen will be out of my hands.</p>
      <p>"I'm just concentrating week by week, enjoying it while I can. The rest will take care of itself."</p>
