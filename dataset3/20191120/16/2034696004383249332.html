      <p>Daniel Craig has confirmed that next year’s <i>No Time To Die</i> will be his last film as <a href="http://nme.com/tag/james-bond">James Bond</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>It’s already been widely reported that the new film, which comes out on April 2, 2020, will be Craig’s last in the role, but he’s now confirmed the news in a recent interview.</p>
      <p>Speaking to German website <i><a href="https://www.express.de/news/promi-und-show/daniel-craig-spricht-klartext--james-bond-muss-in-zukunft-ein-anderer-machen--33480522">Express</a></i>, the actor responded affirmatively when asked if <i>No Time To Die</i> really was the end for him as Bond, adding (via translation): “In the future, someone else has to do it.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he was interested in directing the next Bond film after he steps down from the lead role, Craig said: “For god’s sake, no. I want to come home, eat something and then go to bed.”</p>

      <p>He continued: “If you’re a director, then at night you’re still with the producers, screenwriters [and more] on the phone. And then after two hours of sleep, you have to go back up to the set. No thanks.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/tag/fleabag"><i>Fleabag</i></a> creator <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/phoebe-waller-bridge-talks-adding-little-spices-to-new-bond-film-2565924">Phoebe Waller-Bridge has recently been speaking about her role in scripting <i>No Time To Die</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“They were just looking for tweaks across a few of the characters and a few of the storylines,” the writer said of being brought on board to “help out” and add “little spices” to the script.</p>
      <p>Phoebe then stated her belief that “it doesn’t get cooler” than writing for a James Bond movie.</p>
