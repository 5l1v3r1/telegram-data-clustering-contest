      <h1>Brexit Party candidate: 'I sure as hell am antisemitic'</h1>
      <h2>Marc Stanton also made horrific comments about women and Muslims on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/liam-thorp/" target="_blank">Liam Thorp</a></address>
      <p>A Brexit Party candidate proudly stated 'I sure as hell am antisemitic' and posted horrific posts about women and Muslims.</p>
      <p>Marc Stanton, who is standing as the party's Parliamentary candidate in the West Lancashire constituency, made a number of racist and seriously offensive social media posts in 2014.</p>
      <p>When confronted with these posts he has now apologised for the 'appalling' language used.</p>
      <p>The posts have been revealed by the <a href="https://totalcitizen.wordpress.com/">totalcitizen blog</a> and will pose serious questions about how he has been selected as a Parliamentary candidate.</p>
      <p>One Facebook status written in 2014 stated: "It would appear that wearing headscarves or burkas does not stop you being gang raped or hung from a tree."</p>
      <p>Another responding to a spook article about Muslims on the Newsthump website saw him comment: "See, the BNP are right."</p>
      <p>And speaking about Egypt, he said the country 'should be avoided at all costs and left to rot in the middle ages", adding: "They are not acceptable to the rest of the world."</p>

      <p>Another shocking Facebook status, also posted in 2014, stated: "Having just watched the latest news about Gaza, I can't say I am a fan of fanatical Islam - but I sure as hell am antisemitic now."</p>
      <p>And in a further gruesome comment about Judaism, he added: "The situation between Palestine and Israel seems to continually get worse.</p>
      <p>"Of course, I could not possibly express an opinion but one could perhaps understand why some people might feel that the Israelis learnt their lesson well 60 years ago about genocide and oppression. The student should not always follow the teachings of the professor."</p>
      <p>Another post from around the same time included a volley of terrible slurs against women from the former Edge Hill University lecturer</p>
      <p>Mr Stanton complained that when going to the chemist he couldn't get out of the door because of a 'fat b**** with tattoos pushing a pram and asked 'why am I paying her to f***?'</p>

      <p>His grim tirade continued: "I can imagine that she has put on a bit of weight. But let's be honest she had to be a fat b**** before she got pregnant."</p>
      <p>He added: "I have a natural fail safe device that stops me doing this. If the beer is that good my d*** stops working before I f*** anything that fat."</p>
      <h3>Marc Stanton's response:</h3>
      <h3>We asked Mr Stanton to respond to his previous social media posts, this is what he said:</h3>
      <p>"It has been brought to my attention that I have used some appalling language on my private Facebook page in the past.</p>
      <p>"I regret wholeheartedly using such language and realize that it will have offended some people.</p>
      <p>"For this, I apologise.</p>
      <p>"The comments were made years ago, at the end of a tiring day, and on a private account.</p>
      <p>"I made a mistake and condemn such language and all forms of bigotry.</p>
      <p>"One comment, however, was clearly sarcastic.</p>
      <p>"I posted a link to an article on the satirical website NewsThump mocking stories linking Hala meat to radicalism, with the comment, “see, the BNP are right.”</p>
      <p>" was clearly mocking racists like the BNP here, not in any way backing them.</p>
      <p>"I have spent years as part of a mixed society of many different nationalities and religions and social types.</p>
      <p>"I honestly believe that everyone is equal and that is what I have always strived to ensure in my daily life.</p>
      <p>"My Grandmother was Jewish and so being part Jewish myself, I find it strange that I am being accused of being anti-Semitic and Islamophobic at the same time.</p>
      <p>"I have always endeavored to treat every one of whatever background equally.</p>
      <p>"It would seem that some of my Facebook posts from several years ago have been taken out of context and in a selective manner for the purpose of trying to cause me a problem.</p>
      <p>"I do object to radicalism and extremism from any religion or ideology.</p>
      <p>"Some of my criticism of extremism was strongly worded and I apologise if it was perceived as offensive to Muslims.</p>
      <p>"I object to journalists being arrested by Egypt just as I object to civilians being targeted by military forces.</p>
      <p>"I also object to demeaning language used against women and regret if some of my comments were read in this way.</p>
      <p>"I had had a particularly difficult day when everything had gone wrong and as my post stated, it was my “rant for the day.” I now realize that it was a rant in bad taste and has obviously caused offense."</p>
