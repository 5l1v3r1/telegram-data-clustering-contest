      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Borderlands 3's first campaign DLC has us raiding the Handsome Jackpot for Moxxi.</li>
        <li>It is set to release on December 19, 2019.</li>
        <li>It is available for Season Pass holders or those who purchased the Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 3.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Because Gearbox just can't let go of Handsome Jack, Borderlands 3's first major campaign DLC focuses on the former Hyperion CEO... sort of. He's still rotting in the ground after his death, but Mad Moxxi has a job for us Vault Hunters: to raid his lavish casino and loot the riches within. Sounds fun.</p>

      <blockquote>Moxxi's assembling a crew to plunder a derelict space station casino and you've proven yourself worthy of joining her ragtag team of "experts." Successfully battle your way through Hyperion security forces and crazed casino-goers to reach a safe loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot!</blockquote>
      <p>In order to be able to play the expansion once it's downloaded, you'll need to have made it far enough in the game to reach Sanctuary III. Enemies and loot will scale to your Vault Hunter's level, which will be perfect considering this DLC has some new legendaries to collect.</p>
      <p>Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Vault will be available on December 19, 2019 to those who own the Season Pass or purchased the Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 3. It will also be available to purchase separately by itself if you own the base game.</p>
