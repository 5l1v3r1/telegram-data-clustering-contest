        <i>Cash, drugs and luxury cars were seized after a series of raids on Wednesday</i>
      </p>
      <p>Ten suspected members of an organised crime group have been arrested on suspicion of flying an estimated £15.5m out of the UK to Dubai hidden in suitcases.</p>
      <p>The National Crime Agency, whose officers made the arrests in a series of raids across London on Wednesday morning, said the suspects were also suspected of trying to smuggle 17 people into the UK this summer.</p>
      <p>“The suspects are alleged to have been part of a well-orchestrated conspiracy to launder millions of pounds of money made through class A drugs and organised immigration crime, transferring it from the UK to Dubai over the last three years,” the NCA said. “Examinations of travel history suggest this crime group have transported more than £14m in 2017 and 2018 alone.”</p>
      <p>During the raids, a 41-year-old man suspected of being the head of the network was arrested at his home in Hayes. He and the other suspects were arrested on suspicion of money laundering and facilitating illegal immigration.</p>
      <p>Officers who searched properties in west London recovered cash, drugs and luxury cars, including Range Rovers, Audi Q7s and BMW 5 series.</p>
      <p>The raids followed an NCA investigation, supported by the Metropolitan police, into cash seizures totalling more than £1.5m made by Border Force officers this year. In all cases the cash was being transported between UK airports and ports and the United Arab Emirates, investigators said.</p>
      <p>Chris Hill, an NCA senior investigating officer, said: “Cash is the lifeblood of organised crime groups and they need the services of money launderers. We are determined to do all we can to target illicit financial flows and hit organised criminal networks where it hurts – in the pocket.”</p>
      <p>Ben Russell, deputy director of the National Economic Crime Centre, said: “We were able to assist the case team in arranging forensic analysis of seized banknotes. We were also able to use our relationships with our international partners in the UAE to obtain evidence in relation to this case.</p>
      <p>“The NECC has a unique role in coordinating the response to cash smuggling with other national and international law enforcement partners. Working together, our aim is to arrest and disrupt the criminals who carry out this type of activity. Our joined up approach within UK law enforcement and across the globe helps bring more people to justice.”</p>
