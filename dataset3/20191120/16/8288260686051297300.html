      <h1>The £35million question hanging over Aston Villa as 13 players fight for their future</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfers | Dean Smith signed 12 players in the summer yet as many as 13 could be out the door come the summer of 2021 as contracts tick down by the month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Preece, https://www.facebook.com/PreeceBirminghamLive/</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa already have a relatively-small squad with just 25 - including FOUR goalkeepers - to choose from.</p>
      <p>Dean Smith and the club's hierarchy went about their business efficiently in the summer having signed 12 players for an initial £130m.</p>
      <p>And that summer spending spree was very much needed after a huge cull of ageing - and limited - playing staff not fit for the Premier League.</p>
      <p>In total, a whopping 17 players departed Bodymoor Heath, including five out on-loan: Scott Hogan, Andre Green, Callum O'Hare, James Bree and Rushian Hepburn-Murphy.</p>

      <p>However, with the January transfer window fast approaching, we list the Villa players who are, in effect, currently playing for their futures.</p>
      <p>Club captain James Chester and striker Jonathan Kodjia are among a list of six whose deals are just seven months away from expiring.</p>
      <p>Youngsters Keinan Davis, Green, O'Hare and Hepburn-Murphy make up that six-some and it remains to be seen if any are offered an extension.</p>
      <h3>Aston Villa - End of Decade</h3>
      <p>Welcome to our Aston Villa 'End of Decade' series.</p>
      <p>We're looking back on the 'Teenies' - the last 10 years at AVFC.</p>
      <p>It's hardly been a vintage time for Villa, but at least it is ending with plenty of hope and optimism with the Lions finally back in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>There's been some lowlights, and a smattering of highlights from January 2010 to now - and we'll bring you a host of them here.</p>

      <p>Alarmingly and, if Villa somehow fail in their attempts to land a new striker in January, they could have just ONE senior striker at the club come June, Wesley.</p>
      <p>Villa, though, could look to cash-in on Kodjia while they can amid mooted Qatari and Turkish interest in January while Davis is currently out sidelined with a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old is yet to start in the Premier League but he'll be hoping to make an impact on his return in order to force Smith's hand in offering him a new deal, especially given the stern Championship interest in him during the summer.</p>
      <p>Green and Hepburn-Murphy, you'd expect, will be told their surplus to requirements after failing to make an impact at Preston and Tranmere respectively.</p>

      <p>Looking ahead to the following summer of 2021, five of Villa's current first-team squad will be out of contract.</p>
      <p>The likes of Henri Lansbury, Ahmed Elmohamady and Neil Taylor could, in the summer, have their eyes on a: securing a more long-term contract and b: playing more regularly elsewhere.</p>
      <p>One thing is for certain, though, and that the next couple of transfer windows will be busy yet again as the Aston Villa rebuild continues.</p>
