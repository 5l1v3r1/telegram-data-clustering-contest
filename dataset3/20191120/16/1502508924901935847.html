      <p>Providing relief to the country's stressed telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved a two-year moratorium on payment of pending spectrum auction instalments for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22.</p>
      <p>The decision has been taken “in view of the stress faced by the telecom companies and recommendations of the committee of secretaries”, said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.</p>
      <p>These deferred amounts will be equally spread over the remaining instalments to be paid by the telecom service providers — without any increase in the existing time period specified for making the payments — Sitharaman said. “The interest as stipulated while auctioning of the spectrum concerned will not change so that the net present value (NPV) does not get altered.”</p>
      <p>The move to defer payments for 2020-21 and 2021-22 will give Rs 42,000 crore relief to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio.</p>
