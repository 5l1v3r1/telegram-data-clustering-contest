      <h1>US begins issuing licenses for companies to supply 'non-sensitive' goods to Huawei</h1>

      <p>The U.S. Commerce Department confirmed Wednesday it has begun issuing licenses for some U.S. companies to supply non-sensitive goods to China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.<br/><br/>President Donald Trump's administration gave the green light in the first week of October to start approving licenses for a few American companies, to bypass the ban it put on the Chinese equipment maker this year.</p>
      <p>The administration had put Huawei on an economic blacklist back in May, citing national security concerns, but on Monday agreed to again extend a temporary general license to assist some U.S. rural network operators.</p>
      <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network late Tuesday that the department has "had 290-something requests for specific licenses. We now have been starting to send out the 20-day intent to deny letters and some approvals."</p>
