      <p>As the holiday shopping season rages onward, more and more deals are popping up on sites like <a href="http://tyvm.ly/J42w">Amazon</a>. One of the site’s latest deals is a slightly unconventional piece of <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/lenovo-smart-home-deals-november-2019-1049795/">smart home tech</a> — an automated <a href="http://tyvm.ly/owK8S">smart vacuum by Roborock</a>.</p>
      <p>In fact, there are two versions of the vacuum users can pick up right now. You can purchase the more budget-friendly <a href="http://tyvm.ly/loFmCn3">Roborock E35</a> for as little as $240, which is $110 off the original price. And the slightly more premium <a href="http://tyvm.ly/wnDy">Roborock S5</a> has a new low price tag of $350, which is $150 off the retail cost. </p>
      <p>Both of these smart vacuums are suitable for hard and carpeted floors, and they both come with 5,200mAh batteries for hours of nonstop cleaning. They also both double as automated mops, and they are self-recharging when they run out of juice. That means you can pretty much set it and forget it when it comes to theses Roborock vacuums. On top of that, they both also work with the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-alexa-speaker-955914/">Alexa ecosystem</a>, so they integrate seamlessly into your existing Amazon smart home setup.</p>
      <p>We aren’t sure how long these Roborock vacuum deals will be available. So, if you or someone you know are in the market for a solid robot vacuum, then look no further.</p>
