      <h1>Man “thrown out of the window” after being caught by real husband</h1>

      <p>Flirting with a married woman or man can be one deadly adventure one can ever indulge him or herself as the outcome when caught can be more critical or better still scary than one can ever imagine.</p>
      <p>The above scenario has been the case of one young man whose footage has gone viral on the internet. Actual details of the viral footage can’t be established but all that one can see is, a young man was trying to hide from someone. He was half-naket and whiles hiding, a lady peeped through the window to check if he’s safe.</p>
      <p>With the help of<b> inferential logic, o</b>ne can deduce that the guy was obviously cheating with someone’s wife. And once the woman’s husband came home, he was ironically thrown out of the window by the woman so that he won’t be seen by the real husband.</p>
