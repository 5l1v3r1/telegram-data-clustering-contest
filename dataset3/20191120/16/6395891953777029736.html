      <p>Ann Turner Cook, whose image on Gerber products became famous when she was 4 months old in 1928, turned 93 Wednesday. </p>
      <p>Cook was 4 months old in 1927 when a family friend, Dorothy Hope Smith, sketched a charcoal drawing of the cherubic-faced infant. Smith submitted her work to Gerber's contest the following year, according to the <a href="https://www.gerber.com/about/meet-the-gerber-baby">Gerber</a> website. When the drawing won, Smith said she would complete it, but Gerber officials were enamored with the original work and trademarked it in 1931.</p>

      <p>"(Smith) wrote me (later) that she had thought it was kind of unfinished, and if they liked it she could finish it properly," Cook told <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/tampa-native-original-gerber-baby-turns-90-years-old-today/">WFLA</a> in 2016. "But they were smart enough that they didn't want anything done to it."</p>
      <p>Cook's identity was kept <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/hot-topics/happy-birthday-original-gerber-baby-turns-90/469720177">private</a> until she joined the company for its 50th-anniversary celebration in 1978.</p>
      <p>"I was a happy, healthy baby and I think that's why the drawing has been so appealing to people," she told <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/original-gerber-baby-tampas-ann-turner-cook-turns-93">WTVT</a> in 2013. "Because everybody wants their baby to be happy, healthy-looking."</p>
      <p>Cook was an English teacher at Tampa's Hillsborough High School for 26 years, <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/original-gerber-baby-tampas-ann-turner-cook-turns-93">WTVT</a> reported. She said she began every year answering questions about the Gerber baby</p>
      <p>"And then I would say, 'Now we won't talk about this anymore' because I didn't want it to monopolize the time I had with my students," Cook told <a href="https://www.fox13news.com/news/original-gerber-baby-tampas-ann-turner-cook-turns-93">WTVT.</a></p>
      <p>After retiring as a teacher, Cook began writing <a href="http://annturnercook.com/">mystery novels</a> with Florida subjects, including "Shadow Over Cedar Key," "Homosassa Shadows" "Tracing Their Shadows" and "Micanopy In Shadow."</p>
      <p>Cook's father, Leslie Turner, was a cartoonist who drew the strip "Captain Easy" for more than three decades.</p>
