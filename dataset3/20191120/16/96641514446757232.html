      <h1>Mixer streamers can limit clip-making to their regular viewers</h1>
      <h2>It's also easier to trim a clip and capture the right moment.</h2>

      <p>Ask livestreamers about their gripes and they'll probably complain about the glut of user-made clips. It's not uncommon to see multiple clips for the same event, seemingly pointless clips or even creepy clips that take moments out of context. Microsoft might have a way to prevent those junk videos in the future, however. Partnered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-31-mixer-subscription-fee-twitch.html">Mixer</a> streamers now <a href="https://blog.mixer.com/2019/11/19/new-improvements-to-mixer-clips/">have the option</a> of restricting clip creation to people who've achieved a minimum rank in their channels. If you're a broadcaster, you could use this to limit clips to regular viewers and keep out the trolls.</p>
      <p>If you're a viewer, you'll have a better shot at producing quality clips. You can trim clips to specific sections and preview the results before you publish them. You're limited to at least 15 seconds and a maximum 60 seconds, but you'll have a better chance of preserving a hilarious moment than you did before. Mixer is offering the new clip editor alongside the old one for a "short time" to ease the transition.</p>
      <p>To some extent, Microsoft needs these tools. Now that it has high-profile streamers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/08/07/ninja-1-million-mixer-subscribers/">Ninja</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-shroud-twitch-mixer-ninja.html">Shroud</a> on Mixer, it's dealing with a flood of users who might be new to the service (or new to these streamers, at least). This could help partnered streamers manage their channels and inrease the chances a given clip will be worth keeping.</p>
