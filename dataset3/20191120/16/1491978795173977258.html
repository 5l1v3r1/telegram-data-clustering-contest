        <i>Actor has maintained his innocence after claims his homophobic attack was staged and blames authorities for ‘emotional distress’</i>
      </p>
      <p>Former Empire actor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/26/empire-jussie-smolletts-send-off-was-an-imperfect-and-quick-moment">Jussie Smollett</a> has filed a counterclaim against the city of Chicago for a malicious prosecution that caused “humiliation, mental anguish and extreme emotional distress”.</p>
      <p>Smollett believes his $10,000 payment after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/21/jussie-smollett-case-special-prosecutor-to-investigate-why-charges-were-dropped">close of a criminal case</a> should prevent Chicago from seeking reimbursement for a police investigation of his claim that he was a victim of a racist and homophobic attack.</p>
      <p>His attorneys filed a response on Tuesday to Chicago’s lawsuit in federal court. The counterclaim is also aimed at several <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chicago">Chicago</a> police department officers, and brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo.</p>
      <p>According to documents, Smollett’s legal team claim that the police department “obtained false, self-serving and unreliable statements” from the Osundairo brothers. It goes on to say that investigators ignored “evidence that contradicted those statements played a significant role in the commencement of proceedings”.</p>
      <p>Smollett told police he was beaten in January by two men who looped a noose around his neck. Chicago police said it was staged, and Smollett was charged with making a false report.</p>
      <p>But prosecutors in March dropped the case. Smollett maintains his innocence but agreed to let authorities keep a $10,000 bail. The city of Chicago is seeking $130,000 from Smollett to recoup the cost of the police investigation.</p>
