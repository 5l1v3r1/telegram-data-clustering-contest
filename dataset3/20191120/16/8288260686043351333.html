      <h1>Aston Villa flop Micah Richards says this about Liverpool star - and it's bold</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news includes Richards' verdict on Liverpool midfielder and Harry Kane comparison</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:14:36+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:14</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> defender Micah Richards has hailed Jordan Henderson as England’s only world-class midfielder.</p>
      <p>Richards, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-micah-richards-bbc-16991581">whose career at Villa flopped before coming to end earlier this year,</a> has been giving his verdict on the Premier League as part of a recent push into punditry.</p>
      <p>Henderson captained Liverpool to Champions League glory in May but it is often claimed he is not afforded the praise he deserves outside of Anfield circles.</p>
      <p>But there can be no doubt the 29-year-old has a big fan in Richards, who reckons he is the only Three Lions international on the same level as Tottenham striker Harry Kane.</p>

      <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Richards said: “Harry Kane is world-class. In midfield, there’s no other world, world-class midfielders.</p>
      <p>“Henderson, you’d argue Henderson’s world-class, because of what he’s done and consistency and whatnot.</p>
      <p>“He’s won a European Cup, he’s been consistent over the last three or four years. Yeah, it really is [hard to write off a Champions League-winning captain].</p>
      <p>“You know what, I’m going to go with that statement, I’m going to say Henderson is world-class and a lot of the work that he does goes unnoticed because he’s not getting 10 assists a season or scoring 10 goals a season.</p>

      <p>“I was referring to on the field but off the field as well.</p>
      <p>“I’ve played with Henderson and he’s just an honest guy who would run through brick walls for you, he’s willing to improve, he wants the team to be at its best.</p>
      <p>“When Liverpool first signed him a lot of people were raising their eyebrows but now I think we have to start giving him the credit that he’s due.</p>
      <p>“I watched him in the Liverpool-Man City game and he just doesn’t stop running.”</p>
