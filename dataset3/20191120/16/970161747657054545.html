      <p>The director of Joker, Todd Phillips, is one smart businessman as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/joaquin-phoenixs-joker-earns-sequel-hitting-1-billion-box-office-despite-gun-violence-backlash-11189468/">chatters surround the potential of a sequel</a> to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dc-comics/">DC Comics</a> film starring Joaquin Phoenix.</p>
      <p>An absolute hit with Batman fans and regular punters who’ve nary read a comic book (ahem), Oscar chatters are already populating the narrative around the flick.</p>
      <p>And now the film has passed the $1billion (£774million) mark since its early-October release, Todd is set for a massive payday after shunning a fancy salary upfront and reportedly inking a deal for a slice of the gross takings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joker-sequel-works-as-todd-phillips-eyes-more-dc-origin-movies-1256255">According to The Hollywood Reporter</a>, sources claimed the director will earn close to $100million (£77million) for his slice of the pie after ‘he deferred his upfront salary in exchange for a bigger slice of the adjusted gross’.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Todd has wrangled such a move according to the publication, that reported for the first Hangover movie he did the same thing, with the OG offering taking in $467.5million (£360million) worldwide at the box office.</p>

      <p>Other stars have done the same thing, by shunning a rather impressive first offer to sign on and instead negotiating for a share of the box office goodies.</p>

      <p>It was said that in 1994 Tom Hanks agreed to star in Forrest Gump as the titular character in exchange for a portion of the box office takings.</p>
      <p>A massive success, it went on to earn $680million (£526million) worldwide and in the end Tom apparently earned over $60million (£46million) which ain’t a bad paycheque.</p>
      <p>Joker emerged as a prized pig for 2020 awards season when it became the fourth DC film to rake in $1billion, but with a budget of $60million, the rewards are said to be greater when the big wigs start counting the profit.</p>
      <p>Other profitable comic book movies include Venom, which brought in $854million (£668million) on a $90million (£70million) budget and Deadpool which raked in $783million (£612million) on a production budget of $58million (£45million).</p>
      <p>While THR claimed a sequel was all but confirmed by sources, Joaquin recently admitted that part of the appeal of the comic book movie was that it was a ‘standalone’ project. But talk of a sequel started as soon as he and director Todd Phillips were on set.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the LA Times, Joaquin explained: ‘I guess the fear was that you’d get locked into doing something repeatedly that you don’t really care about, that doesn’t motivate you or excite you.</p>
      <p>‘Part of the whole attraction to me [of Joker] was there was no expectation. I didn’t sign a deal to do [more movies]. It was a one-off.’</p>
