      <p>Cleveland Browns have designated tight end David Njoku to return from injured reserve after over two months on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>Njoku was due to return to practice on Wednesday after recovering from a broken wrist sustained in a Week 2 victory over the New York Jets.</p>
      <p>The Browns have three weeks to activate Njoku, otherwise he will remain on the injured reserve list for the remainder of the NFL season.</p>
      <p>Njoku, who took four catches for 37 yards and scored a touchdown in Week 1 against the Tennessee Titans, could make his comeback against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday if the Browns elect to activate him.</p>
      <p>Cleveland have recovered to 4-6 after securing back-to-back wins going into the home Dolphins game.</p>
