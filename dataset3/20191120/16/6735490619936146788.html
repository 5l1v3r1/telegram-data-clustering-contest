      <h1>Pro Golfer Gives Fan With Down Syndrome A Hug After Ill-Timed Yelp Botched His Putt And Cost Him A Win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:43:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Brent Furdyk</a></address>
      <p>A tense moment that could have gone bad turned unexpectedly sweet, proving that kindness goes a long way.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/news/after-playoff-loss-brandon-matthews-embraces-fan-who-yelled-his-backstroke?utm-tags=golf1305000">The Golf Channel reports</a>, pro golfer Brandon Matthews was competing at the VISA Open de Argentina in Buenos Aires on Sunday and was on the third playoff hole about to make a crucial putt that could win him the tournament.</p>
      <p>Just as he was about to make his putt, recounts the 25-year-old golfer, he became distracted by a noise.</p>
      <p>“I got over the putt, took the putter back and heard kind of a yelp or a scream,” he said. “I kind of flinched on the putt and immediately knew I missed it.”</p>
      <p>Matthews admits he was understandably upset, thinking that someone deliberately tried to sabotage his putt.</p>

      <p>“I thought someone had done it intentionally. I was frustrated,” he adds. “Really, I was in shock that that just happened.”</p>
      <p>As it turned out, the noise wasn’t intentional at all, but the sound of excitement from an enthusiastic golf fan with Down syndrome.</p>
      <p>When Matthews learned what took place, he asked to meet the fan — so he could give him a hug and let him know it was okay.</p>

      <p>“There’s nothing you can do about that. I mean, the guy was out there, he was enjoying it,” Matthews said in video posted on the PGA Instagram page.</p>
      <p>“I feel for the guy, ‘cause I’m sure he felt terrible,” Matthews added. “That’s why I went and gave him a glove and a ball afterwards and gave him a hug. It’s just one of those things that happens.”</p>
