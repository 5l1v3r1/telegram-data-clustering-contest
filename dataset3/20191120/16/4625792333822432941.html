      <h1>Ken Starr: Sondland testimony will be remembered as 'one of those bombshell days'</h1>

      <p>Former independent counsel Ken Starr claimed that U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland's testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee would prove to be monumental moving forward.</p>
      <p>During his Wednesday morning testimony, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/the-answer-is-yes-sondland-says-there-was-a-quid-pro-quo">Sondland affirmed a quid pro quo agreement</a> for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to secure a meeting and phone call with President Trump. But, he also reiterated the fact that he has no direct evidence to tie those claims to the aid that Trump had held up.</p>
      <p>Starr, most known for heading an investigation into members of the Clinton administration, appeared on Fox News following the Democrats' questioning of Sondland.</p>
      <p>"It leads me that there will be articles of impeachment. I think we’ve known that. I think it was just confirmed today, and then substantively what we heard from the chairman just now is, it’s over," Starr stated. "We now know ... this is his position. We now know that the president, in fact, committed the crime of bribery. The something of value, that's litigable. But, I think articles of impeachment are being drawn up if they haven’t already been drawn up. So, it depends will it be bipartisan and so forth. So, this obviously has been one of those bombshell days."</p>
      <p>Starr previously called the president's tweet attacking former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch during her testimony last week, an example of <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/ken-starr-trumps-tweet-during-yovanovitch-testimony-was-extraordinarily-poor-judgment">"extraordinarily poor judgment</a>."</p>
