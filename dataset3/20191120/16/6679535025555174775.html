      <p>SEBI has taken note of the frequent technical glitches at the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and will take up the matter with the bourse, which has a near monopoly in the equity derivatives segment.</p>
      <p>“This is something that should not happen. We will call them soon. We will fix this,” said Mr. Tyagi when asked about the glitches at NSE.</p>
      <p>On the matter of Karvy Stock Broking wherein clients have alleged delay in payouts, the SEBI Chairman said that the regulator was examining the matter.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the SEBI has amended the listing and disclosure norms to reduce the overall time line for a rights issue from the current 55 days to 31 days.</p>
