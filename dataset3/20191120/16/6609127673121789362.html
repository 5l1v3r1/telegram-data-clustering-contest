        <b>A TINY kitten has been left blind after being neglected by its owner and sold online at just four weeks-old.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The cat, named Cookie, was sold to a buyer who was unaware of the animal's critical eye condition.</p>

      <p>The malnourished moggy has now been left with horror wounds and unable to see.</p>
      <p>Cookie was brought to the centre last Thursday to be treated immediately, after the new owner was told Cookie's condition.</p>
      <p>The owner is believed to have bought him for £150, exchanging the money cash-in-hand and receiving Cookie in a cat carrier then driving home before noticing the severity of the situation.</p>
      <p>The poorly pet then underwent two weeks of vet checks and treatment, with the new owner footing the £200 vet bills, before being handed over to the Cat Adoption Centre who are now nursing him back to health.</p>
      <p>When he arrived at the centre he weighed as little as a 2-3 week old kitten, though vets recon he was closer to six weeks old.</p>
      <p>This means the frail kitten was detached from his mother well before he should have been, as cats tend to wean six weeks after birth.</p>
      <p>He has also missed out on vital skill development like eating solids, self-grooming and using a litter tray.</p>

      <p>One staff member took to Facebook to highlight what had happened to their "poor wee soul".</p>
      <p>They said: "What I can say about Cookie is that he is a wee fighter &amp; he is acting like any other kitten.</p>
      <p>"With help, he is eating well, finding his way to his litter tray &amp; using it, playing with toys we give him, grooming himself &amp; purring like a wee machine."</p>
      <p>However it is not known whether the kitty will make a full recovery and it is uncertain when he will be re-homed due to the string of health issues he has to overcome.</p>
      <p>Shaming the original owner for their actions, the Facebook post continued: "It’s utterly devastating to think that human neglect could mean he never sees the world around him but we will do absolutely everything we can for him &amp; we are keeping everything crossed that his sight can be saved."</p>

      <p>The adoption centre have now vowed to keep their followers updated on his recovery and hope to restore his sight.</p>
      <p>Many of the Centre's Facebook fans weighed in on the case, one disgraced follower wrote: "This is beyond heartbreaking. I'm glad this wee soul was picked up as he is now in the safest of hands. I hope he makes a full recovery and is able to live a happy life in a loving home. Thank goodness for cats protection and all those kind people who look after these poor souls x"</p>
      <p>While another was reduced to tears, writing: "I am in tears here. Greeder breeders...all I want to do is swear ...heartbroken that humans can actually treat animals with such disrespect. May they rot in hell. I hope they get caught and locked up. Well done to everyone involved with helping this wee soul you are all heaven sent xx".</p>
