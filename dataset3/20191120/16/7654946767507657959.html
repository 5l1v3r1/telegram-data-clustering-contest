      <h1>Pervy trend sees people creating 3D avatars of celebs and exes for VR sex</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:04:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:04</time> by <a rel="author">Christopher Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Just in case people hadn’t already disappointed you enough, 3D sex avatars that look just like celebs — or even your ex — are taking the internet by storm.</p>
      <p>Across numerous online communities, graphics specialists and ambitious amateurs are working with pervy clientele to create computer-generated likenesses of basically anyone their, er, “heart” desires. These increasingly realistic avatars can be “articulated into any position, animated, modified, interacted with in real time and manipulated in ways that defy the constraints of physical reality,” <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5yzpk/they-cant-stop-us-people-are-having-sex-with-3d-avatars-of-their-exes-and-celebrities">according to Vice</a>.</p>
      <p>“I use it to fulfill my sexual fantasies or replicate sexual encounters with my ex-girlfriends,” one fan of this futuristic genre of pornography said. “[The technology] has enabled me to literally feel like I’m there again, i.e. getting a handjob/footjob from my ex looking at me with a smile, or having another ex ride me on the floor in reverse cowgirl in front of a mirror . . . the possibilities are endless.”</p>
      <p>Naturally, celebrities are popular targets for avatars of the likes of Natalie Portman and Lupita Nyong’o, who were found on sale for $19.95 and $18.95, respectively, by Vice. The publication noted that the creation of nonconsensual images is difficult and expensive to fight legally.</p>
      <p>“Everyone jacks off to everyone, it’s human nature, you can’t stop it unless you just stay off grid and never go anywhere or show anywhere and nobody knows you even exist,” a fan posted in a forum dedicated to the content. “It’s our world and freedom, they can’t stop us from jacking off, nobody can, they can merely choose extreme privacy.”</p>
