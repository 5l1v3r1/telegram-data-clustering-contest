      <p><a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/eric-bellinger/profile">Eric Bellinger</a> is keeping good on his promise to release new music every day. His new album<i> Cuffing Season 3</i> drops this Friday and he is releasing songs daily leading up to the project's arrival. Tuesday's release was "OMW", a song for late on a Friday or Saturday night when you're waiting on that special someone. The title "OMW," standing for the phrase "on my way," is about exactly that. Bellinger paints a picture of being en route to his lover which is a relatable moment for most. There's a lot of anticipation when you're waiting on the object of your affection and "OMW" captures that.</p>
      <p>The Hitmaka produced track is a definite addition to your slow jams playlist. For you know...putting on when you get to your destination.</p>
