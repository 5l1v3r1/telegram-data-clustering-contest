      <p>ITV viewers have criticised <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star Adam Thomas for being "inappropriate" with a female member of the crew and making her feel "uncomfortable".</p>
      <p>On Tuesday (19.11.19) evening's episode of spin-off show Extra Camp, which Adam hosts alongside <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-dont-like-emily-atacks-new-hair/">Emily Atack</a> and Joel Dommett, the former Emmerdale actor took viewers through a preview of the series' first eating trial.</p>
      <p>After Emily and Joel introduced the segment, the camera cut to Adam and a crew member called Molly standing in an ice-cream parlour.</p>

      <p>Adam, who shares five-year-old son Teddy and 18-month-old daughter Elsie-Rose with his wife Caroline, said: "I am here with the one, the only, the beautiful, the gorgeous... sorry, what's your name again?"</p>
      <p>Laughter erupted in the studio and the woman with Adam replied, grinning: "It's Molly..."</p>

      <p>"Molly! I knew that," Adam told her. "I was going to say that. Molly's just told me how nervous she is, I'm nervous, so if we can get through this without messing up it'll be a miracle.</p>
      <p>"Right, let's do it. We're a team, okay? Right, first things first, what's your number?"</p>
      <p>Molly, Adam and the crew behind the camera all burst out laughing.</p>

      <p>But it appears some viewers didn't like what they saw, with some even branding it "creepy" and "uncomfortable".</p>
      <p>"Adam Thomas! Bit inappropriate at the trial thing," tweeted one viewer.</p>
      <p>Another said: "Adam Thomas hitting on the trial woman and his whole encounter with her was just creepy #ImACelebExtraCamp #ImACeleb."</p>
      <aside>Isn't Adam married?</aside>
      <p>A third asked: "Doesn't Adam have a missus? #ExtraCamp."</p>
      <p>Someone else put: "Anyone else notice how uncomfortable Adam just made the poor trial lady? #extracamp."</p>
      <p>A fifth tweeted: "Isn't Adam married? Or is this him telling us he's not anymore? #ExtraCamp."</p>
      <p>"Why was Adam Thomas flirting with a member of @ImACelebrity's production team when he has a wife and child?" demanded a sixth viewer, adding: "That's a big no-no."</p>
      <p>ED! contacted reps for ITV and Adam Thomas for comment.</p>
