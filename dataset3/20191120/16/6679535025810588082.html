      <p>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), a highly advanced technique for heart imaging, is among the most superior ways to diagnose heart diseases, according to an interventional cardiologist.</p>
      <p>“OCT is much better in diagnosing coronary heart disease compared to coronary angiography. The latter takes images in 2D, making it difficult to assess the severity of lesion and plaque burden,” Takashi Akasaka, interventional cardiologist, Wakayama Medical University, told press persons at Meenakshi Mission Hospital and Research Centre (MMHRC) here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The cadiologist was invited to a conference hosted by the hospital on November 20 and 21 on clinical applications of OCT and fractional flow reserve (FFR).</p>
      <p>On the first day, 30 cardiologists from across the country took part in the conference. The importance of inculcating new technology and working with advanced techniques were the main focus.</p>
      <p>Dr. Akasaka said OCT ensured a much higher success in coronary stenting and installation of such a system was a boon to cardiac patients. The technique also produced heart imaging that was 10 times higher than an ultrasound.</p>
      <p>Senior consultant at MMHRC, R. Sivakumar, said the hospital had completed several hundred surgeries using the technique. Advanced technology for heart imaging was a necessity in India where more than three million died annually due to heart stroke and heart attack. “OCT can provide quick and accurate diagnosis that can save lives by detecting immediate complications.”</p>
      <p>OCT also provided precise information that a cardiologist required for patients with complex clogged arteries, said senior consultant, N. Ganesh.</p>
      <p>“The culprit for heart attacks is the fat that gets deposited in the blood vessel (artery) and obstructs the normal flow of blood to the muscles of the heart. When a critical limitation of flow occurs, patient starts experiencing chest pain or angina. To detect the extent of block, standard practice is to go for a coronary angiogram. The beauty of an OCT is that one can reconstruct it to a 3D image and it can show the full artery as if you are seeing your heart live.”</p>
