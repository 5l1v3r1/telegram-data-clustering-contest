        <b>RUSSIA face being banned from the Euro 2020 finals next summer due to alleged inconsistencies in anti-doping date - which could hand Scotland a place at the tournament.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4972580/russia-euro-2020-expulsion-doping-scotland/">world's largest nation are also at risk of being suspended</a> from next summer's Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>

      <p>Uefa haven't stated who would replace the Russians in the tournament should they be sanction but Denmark famously profited in 1992 after failing to qualify.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> winger Brian Laudrup was part of the squad who went all the way and lifted the trophy.</p>
      <p>The Danes finished runners up in qualifying but found themselves in the finals after group winners Yugoslavia were not allowed to participate due to being in a state of civil war.</p>
      <p>Steve Clarke's Dark Blues ended their automatic bid to reach the finals in third spot - behind Russia -  but could land a similar free pass to the big event just like the Denmark class of '92.</p>

      <p>Richard Moller-Nielsen's men were given just over a week's notice to get a squad prepared for the Euro finals.</p>
      <p>Less than one month later, the underdogs had completed the miracle and were champions of Europe!</p>
      <p>Denmark qualified from their finals group section in second spot after a win over France, draw with England and a defeat to Sweden.</p>
      <p>The tournament finals only featured eight teams - with the top two from each section of four reaching the semi-finals.</p>

      <p>More heroics followed in the last four as the Danes knocked out the Netherlands 5-4 on penalties following a 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>Footballing icon Marco Van Basten missed the crucial penalty for Holland.</p>

      <p>Then it was on to the final and it was a 2-0 success over Germany which arguably sparked the biggest fairytale in world football.</p>
      <p>Scotland faced off against Russia twice in their Euro qualifying group, with the Russians winning both 2-1 and 4-0 respectively.</p>
      <p>They are one of 12 host countries for next summer's Euro 2020 tournament - which kicks off on June 12.</p>
      <p>Russia's potential punishment comes as the country's anti-doping agency is expected to be declared non-compliant when the World Anti-Doping Agency's executive committee meet on December 9 to discuss the issue.</p>
      <p>Scotland have the cushion of the play-offs because they topped the Nations League group - <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4694106/scotland-euro-2020-play-off-draw-time/">and will discover their semi-final opponents on Friday</a>.</p>
      <p>The winner of the one-off game at Hampden will face either Norway or Serbia in the final with a spot at Euro 2020 up for grabs.</p>
      <p>But after Denmark's Euro '92 success, the Tartan Army could be forgiven for dreaming of a different route to glory.</p>
