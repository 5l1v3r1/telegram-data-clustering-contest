      <p>A man complaining of continuous headaches and seizures has learned he has over 700 tapeworm inside his body.</p>
      <p>Zhu Zhong-fa, 43, from Hangzhou in east China, was baffled after the symptoms lasted for over a month.</p>
      <p>He decided to seek help from doctors at the First Affiliated Hospital of College of Medicine, Zhejiang University.</p>
      <p>Dr Wang Jian-rong from the department of infectious disease, performed a medical checkup on Mr Zhu and diagnosed him with taenaisis.</p>
      <p>He also found over 700 tapeworms across the patient's body.</p>

      <p>Tapeworms, known as taenia solium in medical terms, are usually acquired through the ingestion of tapeworm eggs in undercooked or infected pork.</p>
      <p>Dr Wang told <a href="https://www.pearvideo.com/video_1624070">Pear</a> , a video-sharing platform: "There are multiple presences of space-occupying lesions in the patient's brain.</p>
      <p>"It's also in the lungs and fills up the muscles inside the chest cavity."</p>
      <p>He added the infections has already 'caused damage' to the patient's organs.</p>

        <figcaption>Dr Wang said the infection has caused damages to the patient's organs</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/taeniasis-cysticercosis">World Health Organisation</a> , when tapeworm eggs enter the central nervous system, they can cause neurological symptoms to the patient, including epileptic seizures.</p>
      <p>Luckily taenaisis can be treated with laxatives and medicines but the dosage and duration of the treatment may vary due to the severeness of the infection.</p>
      <p>Mr Zhu said he recalled he had hotpot about a month ago and might not have cooked the meat thoroughly.</p>

        <figcaption>Mr Zhu believed he had not fully cooked the meat while having hotpot</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Dr Wang explained: "We tend to have a lot of meat-based meals in our daily lives, like roast lamb and roast pork.</p>
      <p>"If it's undercooked, the tapeworm eggs will stay alive when ingested.</p>
      <p>"And if you have had the uncooked meat, there's a chance that the tapeworms can travel through the body and inflict different diseases."</p>
