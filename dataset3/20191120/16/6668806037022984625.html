      <p>Priyanka Chopra is a true style icon in every sense of the word. Known for her exquisite sense of style, the actress is always making heads turn with every appearance. Be it the MET Gala, Cannes Film Festival or the airport the actress has had many power fashion moments this year itself.</p>
      <p>Taking a break from her glamourous avatar, Priyanka was spotted in Mumbai with her mother Madhu Chopra today. The actress looked simple yet stylish with a blue denim jacket and a pair of black jeans. She was sporting a red lip and completed the look with black sunnies. Classic and casual, Priyanka sure made this chic ensemble work as an off-duty outfit.</p>
      <p>Take a look.</p>
