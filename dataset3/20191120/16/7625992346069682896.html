      <h3>Savory Baked Apples with Sausage Stuffing</h3>
      <p>Recipe by Charis Satchell</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>1 Tablespoon oil or butter<br/>1 celery stalk, diced<br/>1/4 cup finely diced onion<br/>1/2 package sausage<br/>1 box stuffing mix<br/>1 1/4 cup Swanson's Unsalted Chicken Broth (or the same amount of water called for on the instructions for the stuffing)<br/>6-12 apples such as Granny Smith, Golden Delicious and Red Delicious</p>
      <p>
        <i>Instructions:</i>
      </p>
      <p>1. Heat the oil in a medium or large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and the celery and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes.</p>
      <p>2. Add the sausage to the skillet and cook thoroughly making sure to break it up into crumbles. Remove from heat.</p>
      <p>3. In a large bowl, stir together stuffing mix and sausage mixture. Add Swanson's chicken broth in the same amount as water is called for on the stuffing mix instructions.</p>
      <p>4. Stir the mixture together so that the stuffing is soft and moist. Feel free to add a little more broth if needed. Set the mix aside.</p>
      <p>5. Prepare the apples: Slice the very top of the apples off.</p>
      <p>6. Use a spoon or a melon baller to carefully scoop out the entire core of the apple.</p>
      <p>7. Repeat this for every apple.</p>
      <p>8. Spoon stuffing in to the apples and place in a high-sided baking dish.</p>
      <p>9. Once all the apples are stuffed and in the dish, carefully pour an additional 1/4-12 cup of broth over the apples. Add another 1/4 cup to the bottom of the dish.</p>
      <p>10. Bake uncovered at 350Â° for about 30 minutes or until the apples are softened but not falling apart. If you don't want the stuffing to brown, cover the dish while baking.</p>
