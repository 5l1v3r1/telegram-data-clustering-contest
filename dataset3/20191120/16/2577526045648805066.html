      <h1>A Pokémon Shield Player Beat the Entire Game Using Only a Wooloo</h1>

      <p>In the opening hours of <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i>, I have somehow managed to almost entirely avoid wild Wooloo. There’s rival Hop's ovine pal, of course, and a number of other sheep Pokémon that seem intent on disrupting public transport throughout the Galar region, but they’ve remained strangely absent from my adventure so far.</p>
      <p>For one player, however, Wooloo has made up the entirety of their trip through the latest game. In a post on Reddit last night, player Celvx announced that they’d beaten Shield using nothing but a solitary sheep, posting a video of their Wooloo triumphing over Champion Leon’s Charizard.</p>
      <p>Celvx says “I went into this with zero planning or expectations and while I’m sure I didn’t do it in the most efficient or optimal way, it was a fun challenge nonetheless.” Players were quick to acknowledge that this was most definitely not the best way to have tackled the game, as Celvx’s Wooloo, nicknamed Ares, had a nature which limited its attack stat, and arguably a non-optimal ability too. One comment suggested that Celvx had done “a really hard mode even by Wooloo standards.”</p>
      <p>At level 100, you’d probably expect Ares to triumph over Leon’s significantly weaker Charizard with relative ease, but Celvx says they were severely held up by dragon-type gym leader Raihan’s double battles (for which he subbed in a pretty useless Magikarp) and dark-type leader Piers. A few lucky critical hits undoubtedly helped them through the challenge but, either way, it's an impressive feat.</p>
