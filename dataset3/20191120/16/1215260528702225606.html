        <b>The Tax Office located on King Street in downtown Kingston has again been closed because of noxious fumes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking with <b>The Gleaner</b>, Chief Corporate Communications Officer at Tax Administration Jamaica, Meris Haughton, indicated that this morning staff complained about the air quality inside the building with reports of persons falling ill.</p>
      <p>Haughton says a decision was taken to evacuate the building in the interest of safety.</p>

      <p>She said talks were held with the buildingâ€™s landlord where it was disclosed that work was carried overnight inside the premises and that fumes from the material made its way into the air conditioning system.</p>
      <p>Haughton says further discussions will be held with the landlord today on the way forward.</p>
      <p>She says the building is being aired out and it is likely, following an assessment, that it will remain closed for the rest of the day.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, the building had to be evacuated because of noxious fumes.</p>
      <p>At that time, Haughton said the fumes emanated from a garbage truck that became trapped and circulated inside the building.</p>
