      <h1>'The ground shook' Birmingham City fans pick their childhood Blues heroes</h1>
      <h2>Birmingham City latest | All the latest Blues news and views from BirminghamLive as Bluenoses identify their childhood favourites</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:44:42+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author">Brian Dick, https://www.facebook.com/blueswriterbriandick/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Birmingham City have had some absolute superstars pull on the famous Royal Blue over the decades.</p>
      <p>Trevor Francis, Christophe Dugarry, Mikael Forssell and for those of an older vintage the likes of Alex Govan and Gil Merrick - legends to a man.</p>
      <p>However, favourite players are a very personal thing and it doesn’t have to be a megastar who fires the imagination of a young supporter.</p>
      <p>We asked Bluenoses: “Who was your <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Blues</a> childhood hero and why?” One man featured prominently - but his wasn’t the only one among some real club legends.</p>

      <p><b>Kevin Harley:</b> My first was Fred Pickering, an old fashioned centre forward whose goals in the 1968 FA Cup got us through to the Semi-Final against WBA at Villa Park. I was expecting so much from him in that game, but a header from Pickering that hit the bar was all he could muster, the rest is history. Francis arrived on the scene four years later, a different kind of hero altogether.</p>
      <p><b>Max Bradley:</b> Loved Martin Grainger</p>
      <p><b>Lindsey Harland:</b> Bob Latchford and Trevor Francis</p>
      <p><b>Darren Broadfield:</b> TF and Mick Harford are hard to beat but for the short time we had him Duggary was fantastic , the 3-2 home win over Southampton when he got 2 is the stand out performance KRO</p>

      <p><b>Peter Davis:</b> First game I remember fully is Blues Vs Wigan FA cup 3rd round 1978. I loved watching Francis; but I liked Mark Dennis and Terry Hibbert. All time childhood hero Frank Worthington pre match juggling at its best!</p>
