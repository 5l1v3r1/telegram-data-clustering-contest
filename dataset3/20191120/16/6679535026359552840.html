The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), the DoD body that implements the U.S.’s Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, delivered its certification of the proposed sale to the U.S. Congress, as per the statement. Congress has a thirty day window from when the certification is received to raise any objections to the sale.</p>
      <p>“The MK-45 Gun System will provide the capability to conduct antisurface warfare and anti-air defense missions while enhancing interoperability with U.S. and other allied forces,” the DoD statement said. “India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defense.”</p>
      <p>The sale approval was in response to a Government of India request to buy the guns and 3,500 D349 Projectile, 5”/54 MK 92 MOD 1 Ammunition.The proposed sale will include ammunition, spare parts, training of personnel and equipment, technical data, publications, technical and logistical assistance and transport.</p>
