      <p>I have a very bad habit: saying yes when I really want to say no. It comes with being an introvert, I think — I often feel like I <i>should</i> want to say yes to social outings, so I do. Then I regret it. A lot of people have this habit, it seems; <a href="https://www.self.com/story/saying-no-to-invitations">there are</a> <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brit.co%2Fhow-to-say-no-to-social-plans%2F&amp;referrer=polygon.com">plenty of guides</a> <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-to-say-no-to-invitation_n_5a2ec17be4b06e3bccf30089">on the internet</a> <a href="https://www.shortlist.com/news/going-out-socialising-excuses">on how to say no</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.saynomo.re/"><i>Say No! More</i></a> is not guide to saying no. Instead, it’s a challenge and a fantasy — a game by developer Studio Fizbin that lets you say no to anything and everything. In <i>Say No! More</i>, you play as an intern at “a company run by arrogant people,” and the word “No” has been banished.</p>
      <p>You find a self-help tape called <i>Say No! More</i>, and the rest is history: <i>No, I won’t make your coffee! No, I won’t copy those papers. No, I won’t stop running. No! No! NO!</i> It’s a “one-button” game, apparently, and it leads into a more complicated decision: Saying no to your best friend.</p>
      <p>Studio Fizbin released a trailer with the announcement, and it’s definitely got an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/20/20874259/untitled-goose-game-review"><i>Untitled Goose Game</i></a><i> </i>feel. This may also be a power fantasy where you’re able to cause trouble, except instead of a honk, you’ve got a big ‘ol no.</p>
      <p><i>Say No! More</i> will come to Windows PC, Nintendo Switch, and iOS devices in 2020.</p>
