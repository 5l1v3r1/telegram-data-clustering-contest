      <p>A man gunned down in his own hallway was unlawfully killed, an inquest concluded.</p>
      <p>Jamaican-born Leroy Ottey, 25, was shot from behind by an unknown gunman after entering his home in Alderson Road, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wavertree">Wavertree</a> , on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/shooting-victims-tragic-last-words-15306132">night of October 17 last year.</a></p>
      <p>Area coroner Anita Bhardwaj was told Mr Ottey had just got out of a taxi when the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/gun-crime">gun attack</a> occurred.</p>

      <p>DCI John Middleton of Merseyside Police, in a written statement made to the coroner's court, said Mr Ottey was found collapsed in the doorway.</p>
      <p>A black Audi saloon made off from the scene "at speed" and collided with two other cars during the getaway, but failed to stop.</p>
      <p>The car was later found burnt-out in Abbeystead Road nearby.</p>

      <p>A post mortem found that Mr Ottey died from multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>In his statement, DCI Middleton said the investigation into the murder of Mr Ottey was ongoing but there was "no immediate prospect of charges" being brought.</p>
      <p>Ms Bhardwaj concluded Mr Ottey was unlawfully killed.</p>
      <p>No family members were present for the brief hearing.</p>
      <p>In an appeal made on the first anniversary of his death last month, Mr Ottey's sisters Lerisha and Dana spoke of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/niece-still-asks-hes-coming-17103726">the devastating impact of his murder</a> on the family.</p>

      <p>Lerisha said the family now have "no happy occasions" since the tragic death of her brother.</p>
      <p>The family has stopped running the business the 25-year-old helped them run,  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Lodge Lane</a>  restaurant Sista Sue's, and they have moved out of their old home.</p>
      <p>One year into the investigation, six people have been arrested on suspicion of murder, all of whom remain under investigation.</p>
      <p>They include a 25-year-old man from Toxteth, a 30-year-old man from Wavertree, a 31-year-old man from Rainhill, a 30-year-old man from Toxteth, a 24-year-old man from Toxteth and 23-year-old man from Toxteth.</p>
