      <h1>Muslim Separatists' Attack is Bloodiest in 15 Years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:08:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Richard_S._Ehrlich" target="_blank">Richard S. Ehrlich</a></address>
      <p>BANGKOK, Thailand -- Suspected Muslim separatists attacked poorly<br/>defended road checkpoints killing at least 15 people, including five<br/>women, in the most deadly assault in several years in southern<br/>Thailand where more than 7,000 have died on all sides since 2004.</p>
      <p>Authorities fear a new generation of minority ethnic Thai-Malay Muslim<br/>guerrillas have emerged more efficient in deadly tactics and<br/>frustrated with years of pointless negotiations amid allegations of<br/>torture and extrajudicial killings by both sides.</p>
      <p>The Islamists' hit-and-run attack during the night on November 5<br/>included the use of improvised explosives and comes after the recent<br/>failure of peace talks between the rebels and Thailand's U.S.-trained<br/>military.</p>
      <p>"It is a cruel, barbarian and inhumane act of 'deep south' insurgents<br/>who hurled hand grenades and shot at civilians," said Defense Ministry<br/>spokesman Lt. Gen. Kongcheap Tantrawanit on November 6, according to<br/>BenarNews media which is affiliated with the U.S. government's Radio<br/>Free Asia.</p>
      <p>"This is one of the biggest attack in recent times," Col. Pramote<br/>Prom-in, a regional security spokesman, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>The military's weak spot was their dependence on "village defense<br/>volunteers" to protect some roads, buildings and other possible<br/>targets in the three Muslim-majority provinces of Yala, Narathiwat and<br/>Pattani.</p>
      <p>Volunteers are given a rifle and some basic training, to augment the<br/>military's heavily armed forces who are positioned at priority sites<br/>or on patrols.</p>
      <p>Suspected insurgents stormed a pair of those volunteers' security<br/>checkpoints on a narrow road in Ban Tung Sadao village in Yala<br/>province.</p>
      <p>Dead volunteers included five females and a doctor according to their<br/>identification cards' photographs which were later published.</p>
      <p>After the rebels opened fire, they stole M-16 assault rifles and<br/>shotguns from the volunteers before escaping into the forested hills.</p>
      <p>To deter pursuers, they scattered bent nails on the road and burned tires.</p>
      <p>Security forces said they found bloodied clothing which could indicate<br/>some rebels were injured during the attack.</p>
      <p>"While defense volunteers were minding check points at the outposts,<br/>unknown attackers rode motorcycles while some snuck in on foot to open<br/>fire at them using assault rifles and pistols," a local police chief,<br/>Col. Taweesak Thongsongsi, said.</p>
      <p>"They then retreated into a nearby rubber plantation. We believe they<br/>are insurgents," Col. Taweesak said.</p>
      <p>Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) separatists are believed to have<br/>arranged the assault because they are the largest and best organized<br/>among several rebel groups. No one claimed responsibility.</p>
      <p>Muslims form about 80 percent of the south's population, in contrast<br/>to Thailand's overall 95 percent Buddhist population.</p>
      <p>The southern zone borders Muslim-majority Malaysia. Thailand has asked<br/>Malaysia to help arrange peace talks in the past and clamp down on<br/>cross-border travel by rebels seeking sanctuary there.</p>
      <p>Bangkok recently refused the insurgents' latest demand -- the release<br/>of all suspected rebel prisoners before peace talks could commence.</p>
      <p>Thailand is a Major Non-NATO Ally of the U.S. which has spent decades<br/>training, arming and funding Thailand's armed forces in conventional,<br/>urban, counter-insurgency, jungle, air and sea warfare.</p>
      <p>A U.S.-Thai regional Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Center was<br/>established in Bangkok in early 2001 according to American Benjamin<br/>Zawacki, a former Amnesty International researcher who in 2008<br/>interviewed Muslims allegedly tortured in the south.</p>
      <p>But U.S. support has created problems in the south, he said.</p>
      <p>In his book titled "Thailand: Shifting Ground Between the U.S. and A<br/>Rising China," Mr. Zawacki quoted then U.S.-Ambassador to Thailand,<br/>Ralph "Skip" Boyce, telling Washington in 2005:</p>
      <p>"Two conspiratorial themes" were "widespread and widely accepted" in<br/>Thailand, including " the U.S. military is inciting Muslims to<br/>violence, in order to justify establishing bases in the region [and]<br/>the CIA is funding the insurgents in order to justifying an expanded<br/>U.S. presence in the region for the Global War on Terror."</p>
      <p>Bangkok meanwhile has kept the south under martial law.</p>
      <p>Thai officials insist the insurgency is fueled by ethnic grievances<br/>and not religion, though Islamic schools and traditions are popular in<br/>the south.</p>
      <p>Analysts suggested heeding local Muslim demands to allow wider use of<br/>the region's Yawi dialect alongside mainstream Thai language, and<br/>southern schools to teach the region's history, Islamic traditions and<br/>other related topics.</p>
      <p>Thai officials reject those demands, fearing any loosening of<br/>Bangkok's grip could lead toward independence which will not be<br/>allowed.</p>
      <p>In 1909, Thailand -- then known as Siam -- annexed the southern zone<br/>which was an independent Malay Muslim sultanate which 21st century<br/>separatists hope to reestablish either as an autonomous region or<br/>fully independent.</p>
      <p>During recent negotiations, Thai officials said they would be willing<br/>to discuss "decentralization" but the two side never agreed on<br/>details.</p>
