      <h3>16-inch MacBook Pro hits new Amazon all-time low</h3>
      <p>Amazon has <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-amazon/">Apple’s new 16-inch MacBook Pro 2.6GHz/16GB/512GB for <b>$2,284</b></a>. You can save a <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-amazon/">bit more at Expercom</a>, although they are now backordered a few weeks there at this point. That’s as much as $172 off and the second-best price we’ve tracked. The Amazon listing is a new all-time low price there. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/11/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-top-features-video/">We recently went hands-on</a> with Apple’s latest release, detailing all of its best features and more.</p>
      <h3>Nearly every 12.9-inch iPad Pro model is on sale</h3>
      <p>Today only, Woot offers <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/apple-ipad-pro-deals-woot/">Apple’s latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro in certified refurbished condition from <b>$670</b></a>. Both Wi-Fi and Cellular models are <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/apple-ipad-pro-deals-woot/">on sale here</a>, with capacities from 64GB all the way up to 1TB. For comparison, you’d pay at least $999 in new condition and Apple starts their own refurb models <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/ipad/ipad-pro-12-9">at $849</a>. Today’s deal marks the best we’ve seen all-time.</p>
      <h3>Apple’s latest MacBook Air drops further, now $210 off</h3>
      <p>Today only, 6ave Electronics via Rakuten is offering the <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/apple-macbook-air/">2019 Apple 13-inch MacBook Air, 1.6GHz/8GB/128GB in Gold</a> or <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/apple-macbook-air/">Space Gray for <b>$889</b></a>. That’s $210 off retail found at <a href="http://bit.ly/2ZPbcXS">Best Buy</a> and beats <a href="https://amzn.to/2CXGjD1">Amazon’s sale price</a> by $100. Today’s deal is the lowest price we have tracked, but we expect it to drop <a href="https://twitter.com/gsteve27/status/1196899797099261957">as low as $800</a> for Black Friday. Owners are bound to enjoy Touch ID, a 13-inch Retina display with True Tone, speedy SSD storage, and 8GB of RAM. This is the MacBook I use and absolutely love its all-day battery life and respectable price point (especially right now).</p>
