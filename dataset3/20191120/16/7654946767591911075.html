      <p>A Delta flight attendant from Brooklyn has been accused of being almost seven times over the alcohol limit while on duty at London’s Heathrow Airport, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Lemara Thompson, 27, allegedly had 135 milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood in her body at the major transportation hub on June 16, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/stewardess-almost-seven-times-alcohol-limit-heathrow-11189065/">the UK’s Metro reported</a>.</p>
      <p>She was charged with performing an aviation function with a blood-alcohol level over the prescribed limit, which is 20 milligrams for people performing duties relating to an airliner, according to Civil Aviation Authority rules and the Railways and Transport Safety Act.</p>
      <p>Thompson, who lives on Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn, did not appear at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court for a hearing Wednesday but responded to the court via mail, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Chair Magistrate Alison White adjourned the case for two weeks to give Thompson notice to travel to the British court or to set up a video link. She is expected to appear in court on Dec. 4.</p>
      <p>Delta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
