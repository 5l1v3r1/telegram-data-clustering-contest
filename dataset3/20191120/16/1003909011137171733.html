      <h1>'We don't have a choice': City to ask unionized workers to accept wage freeze or rollback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:43:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The city will ask unionized workers to accept a wage freeze or rollback in 2020, despite being rebuffed earlier this year on a similar request.</p>
      <p>The pitch to reduce wage costs at the city was approved at a council meeting Tuesday night in a 14-1 vote (only Coun. Gian-Carlo Carra was opposed). Council members also voted to proceed with a plan to trial privatized garbage collection for 25 per cent of black bins, as well as to proceed with privatizing operations at all city golf courses.</p>
      <p>Conservatives on council said they were championing the wage strategy to stave off the risk of further layoffs or service reductions.</p>
      <p>“It’s about running the city — 50 per cent of all our operating budget is (wages) and we don’t have a choice. So it’s about participating in helping to keep the taxes down,” said Coun. Ward Sutherland, who co-sponsored the motion with councillors Jeff Davison, Sean Chu, Jeromy Farkas and Joe Magliocca.</p>
      <p>“At least we have to ask, and all we can do is ask because we don’t have the legislative authority (to roll back wages), of course.”</p>
      <p>Council also agreed Tuesday to match any union wage reductions with a decrease to their own base pay.</p>
      <p>But labour relations staff cautioned council Tuesday that the city had <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/insulting-and-seen-as-politically-driven-council-strategy-to-save-money-provokes-union-anger">already approached union leadership in July</a> about the possibility of workers declining a planned 1.5 per cent wage increase next year; the July request was unsuccessful and city staff said they didn’t expect a second request to yield a different answer.</p>
      <p>Asked by council members Tuesday if the city had the authority to carry out mandatory wage rollbacks to city unions, the city’s manager of labour relations suggested the move would be illegal.</p>
      <p>“We’d be in front of the labour board faster than our head would spin,” said Melissa Brunsdon.</p>
      <p>Council also voted 11-4 to proceed with a pilot project to privatize one-quarter of the city’s residential black cart collection. The pilot is expected to be carried out in specific neighbourhoods over a seven-year period.</p>
      <p>Council heard that 10 to 15 jobs could be reduced at the city through the pilot, though some additional jobs could be added so the city could administer the contract.</p>
      <p>The pilot could save the average Calgarian in the range of $1 to $2 per household per year, city staff said Tuesday — a savings that Mayor Naheed Nenshi said was not worth eliminating “decent” jobs for Calgarians.</p>
      <p>“For a savings of one to two dollars per household per year, to replace that person with someone who makes minimum wage, can’t afford to send their kids to university, can’t afford to be part of the community — I’m not certain that’s a social contract that I think is worth moving forward on.”</p>
      <p>Nenshi and councillors Evan Woolley, Gian-Carlo Carra, Druh Farrell voted against the black bin privatization pilot.</p>
      <p>The theme of privatizing city services continued Tuesday evening with council electing to finally move forward with privatizing golf course operations after years of financial reviews and debates.</p>
      <p>Council has always hesitated to proceed with privatizing courses since succession rules under union contracts mean that existing personnel will largely be retained at their current wage levels.</p>
      <p>But with some city golf courses losing money each year, a majority of council members said they supported handing over operations to the private sector.</p>
      <p>The move was criticized by Woolley Tuesday who pointed out that seniors who need affordable places to golf are the most likely to be hurt by the decision.</p>
      <p>The Ward 8 councillor also accused his colleagues of “nibbling around the edges” on popular city services, while ignoring much larger cost-drivers including suburban growth, and the budgets for police, fire and transit.</p>
      <p>“You’re nibbling around the edges, around these tiny little smidgens of moves. I know it’s making everybody feel really, really good about themselves,” said Woolley.</p>
      <p>“But if everybody here wants to pat themselves on the back and be like, ‘I’m really finding big savings in our $4-billion budget’ — you’re not. You’re not doing it.”</p>
