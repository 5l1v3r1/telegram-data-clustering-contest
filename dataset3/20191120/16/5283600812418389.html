      <h1>₹42,000 crore relief for telcos on spectrum fee payment</h1>
      <h2>The move was approved by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi</h2>

      <p>In a major relief for telecom operators, the Cabinet on Wednesday approved two years' moratorium on spectrum payment dues.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet decision means deferral of spectrum dues payment for the next two financial years — 2021 and 2022 — and extension of the number of payment instalments to 18 from 16 currently, the official added.</p>
      <p>The two-year payment holiday will give a ₹42,000-crore relief to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio.</p>
      <p>While there will be a benefit of ₹11,746 crore to Airtel, it will be ₹23,920 crore for Voda Idea and ₹6,670 crore for Jio, a senior government official said.</p>
      <p>“We will not let monopoly prevail in the sector. This is to relieve the distress in the telecom sector,” the official said.</p>
      <p>The telcos have been seeking some relief from the government, especially after the Supreme Court order on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) last month.</p>
      <p>This comes as a major step by the government to ease the burden of the sector that has a debt of over ₹7-lakh crore.</p>
