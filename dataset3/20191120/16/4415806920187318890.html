      <h1>New Central Bank governor sets out priorities in his role</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:47:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The new governor of the Central Bank, Gabriel Makhlouf, has said that lessons should be learned from past mistakes to avoid "a return to the credit-house price spirals".</p>
      <p>In his first keynote speech since being appointed to the role, the British citizen spoke today to students and staff at the Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT).</p>
      <p>Mr Makhlouf, who was born in Egypt, highlighted the vulnerability of the Irish economy, particularly in the context of Brexit and the risk of escalating trade wars.</p>
      <p>He said: "Building economic resilience is not like building a bulwark and then assuming the job is done.</p>
      <p>"There is no one-off solution to the challenge of building resilience. It is a continuous process, involving individuals, households, businesses, institutions and authorities, such as the Central Bank, both at home and abroad."</p>
      <p>While acknowledging improvements in resilience over the last decade, he also identified four key transitions which pose challenges to the Irish people.</p>
      <p>These are Brexit, climate change, the pace of technological change and major changes taking place in the financial system.</p>
      <p>He said building resilience through these is essential.</p>
      <p>"For me it is about continuing to focus on the fundamentals, about managing the short term while planning for the medium term.</p>
      <p>"It is about ensuring our frameworks are fit-for-purpose and learning the lessons of the past while preparing for the future. It is also about being prepared to challenge ourselves."</p>
      <p>He noted that the mortgage measures are a permanent feature of the mortgage market here - and have been key to enabling sustainable lending.</p>
      <p>"It is important to take stock, learn lessons and continue to develop.</p>

      <p>"In particular it is important to consider how the suite of macroprudential buffers interact not only with each other but also with those of microprudential supervision - arriving at a consistent and holistic view of capital for the banking sector - and the other key macroprudential tools in operation."</p>
      <p>"We must continue to look at whether the objectives and scope of our wider macroprudential framework remains appropriate to the current environment."</p>
      <p>Speaking about debt, Mr Makhlouf said: "Most household debt is in mortgages. We are currently reviewing our calibration of the mortgage measures so I will not discuss them in great detail today.</p>
      <p>"However, I want to emphasise that the measures are aimed at strengthening borrower and bank resilience. And our focus remains on avoiding a return to the credit-house price spirals of the past.</p>
      <p>"Irish firms have also reduced their debt relative to their assets, and debt repayment burdens have fallen", he said.</p>
      <p>Since its peak of €202.9bn in the third quarter of 2008, household debt here has fallen by 32.5%, or €66bn.</p>
