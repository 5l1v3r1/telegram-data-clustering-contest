      <p>RBI imposes ₹1.75 crore penalty on Indian Bank</p>
      <p>The RBI has imposed monetary penalty aggregating to ₹1.75 crore on Indian Bank for non-compliance. In a regulatory filing, RBI said the bank failed to comply with its directions on opening of savings bank accounts for a cooperative society, window dressing of the balance sheet as on March 31, 2018, and delayed reporting of frauds.</p>
      <p>“There was no delay in reporting fraud, window dressing or non-adherence of directions. Unfortunately, we do not have a tribunal to appeal against it or seek a review,” said a top Indian Bank official.</p>
