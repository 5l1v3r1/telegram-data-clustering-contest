      <h1>Aaron Wilbraham on how Cardiff City attacker Lee Tomlin changed following permanent Bristol City move</h1>
      <h2>The former City midfielder was 'incredible' in training, according to Wilbraham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:29:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author">Max Baker</a></address>
      <p>Former Bristol City striker Aaron Wilbraham has described 'crackers' Lee Tomlin as 'one of the best' he has ever played with.</p>
      <p>But he admits he saw a change in the midfielder once his loan move to Bristol City was made permanent.</p>
      <p>Fan favourite Wilbraham appeared on the Undr the Cosh podcast recently and discussed everything about his City career, including meeting Steve Cotterill in Dubai before signing and fallouts with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/theyre-kids-exclusive-chat-bristol-3555493">Lee Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>Wilbraham enjoyed three successful seasons at Ashton Gate, winning League One and promotion in 2014/15 and successfully helping City stay in the Championship for the next two seasons.</p>
      <p>He scored 18 league goals in his first season and was also won the EFL Trophy in his time on BS3.</p>
      <p>In a section of the podcast, he discusses his relationship with former Bristol City midfielder Lee Tomlin.</p>
      <p>Tomlin lit up Ashton Gate when he arrived on loan from Bournemouth in January 2016, scoring six goals and helping the Robins escape relegation.</p>
      <p>However, once he had signed a three year deal at the end of the year, Tomlin wasn't the player City fans first saw and he was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-coach-expects-neil-3555195">shipped out to Cardiff a year later</a>.</p>
      <p>Wilbraham was full of praise for Tomlin, but says he did get on the wrong side of Lee Johnson and was a 'heavy' player.</p>
      <p>He said: "He's a great player, Tommo. He's crackers.</p>
      <p>"Lee Tomlin with Lee Johnson was funny. He brought him in on loan from Bournemouth and he smashed it. He single handedly kept us up in the league. The fans loved him, singing 'sign him up'.</p>

      <p>"They gave him a three year deal on big money and I knew what Tommo was like. He'd come in and get comfortable.</p>
      <p>"I had a feeling when he came back on this three year bumper deal that he'd be a different man.</p>
      <p>"He was incredible in training, he used to chip the keepers at least six or seven times. He'd made this little noise as he did it.</p>
      <p>"He's one of the best I played with.</p>
      <p>"But when he got that new contract, he came in on the first day of pre-season in a brand new Bentley and Lee Johnson pulled him aside and said: 'You can't do that. Everyone knows you're the highest paid player, you don't have to come in in the best car'.</p>
      <p>"He said he had to be an example to the young lads. (Tomlin) said: 'Gaffer, I'll let you do that in your old Range Rover.' He'd say it front of everyone."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aaron-wilbraham-steve-cotterill-bristol-3556465">Wilbraham</a> also spoke about Tomlin's diet and physique and that, despite his quality, he took no notice of the nutritionist brought in by the club.</p>
      <p>"He was a heavy lad. He was at 22 per cent body fat and the gaffer wanted everyone at around seven or eight. But he was the best in training, the best at running, so why did he need to?</p>
      <p>"We'd have these nutritionists in and we'd walk in the room with the geeky nutritionist stood at the front and on the big plasma screen it would have pictures of KitKats and cakes and crisps.</p>
      <p>"Tommo would walk in the meeting knowing it was all aimed at him, so he'd say: 'Cor, that's making me feel hungry'.</p>

      <p>"This nutritionist didn't know what to say, but he (Tomlin) didn't care.</p>
      <p>"Johnson used to ask me to get him on the green tea because me and Marlon Pack used to drink green teas and get on the granola.</p>
      <p>"The gaffer would say not to have a hot chocolate, but (Tomlin) would sit down and have marshmallows, flakes, loads of cream, Victoria sponge.</p>
      <p>He'd send a selfie to the gaffer with all these marshmallows. He's another lovable rogue.</p>
      <p>He's an unbelievable talent, he's just a bit of a clown."</p>
