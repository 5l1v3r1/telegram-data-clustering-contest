      <h1>Wake Me Up When The Game Awards End with Green Day Performance and Reveal</h1>
      <h2>Know Your Enemy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/LiamCroft" target="_blank">Liam Croft</a></address>
      <p>American Idiot! Basket Case! Boulevard of Broken Dreams! You see, we're definitely down with the kids when it comes to Green Day. Although, we might be able to add a few more songs to our repertoire when <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/tags/the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a> roll around next month because it has just been announced that the US rock band will be performing at the show.</p>
      <p>Revealed by Geoff Keighley on <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1197182816133337088">Twitter</a>, the group will get on stage for a "videogame-inspired performance and announcement." Whether that'll be an entirely new game or not remains to be seen, a new <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/rock_band">Rock Band</a> or <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/guitar_hero_live">Guitar Hero</a> entry perhaps? We'll have two wait a few weeks before we find out, however, with The Game Awards taking place on 12th December.</p>

      <p>Oh, wait! Looking through Green Day's track listings, we even recognise Jesus of Suburbia. Now that has to be one to impress the die-hards, right? Although, it'll be a Boulevard of Broken Dreams when <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/elden_ring">Elden Ring</a> doesn't actually turn up at the show, right?...Right? Sorry, we'll see ourselves out.</p>
