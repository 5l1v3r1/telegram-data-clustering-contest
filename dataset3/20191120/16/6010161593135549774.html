      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:57:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot is the first DLC campaign coming to Borderlands 3.</p>
      <p>This is the first of four DLCs for <b>Borderlands 3</b> and it drops on December 19.</p>
      <p>It is included in both the Season Pass and the Borderlands 3 Super Deluxe Edition.</p>
      <p>The DLC was announced in the latest Borderlands show, where the development team at Gearbox also discussed the patch coming to this week, which includes the endgame challenge of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/30/borderlands-3-maliwans-blacksite-november-21/">Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite launching tomorrow</a>, Mayhem Mode 4, and some quality-of-life improvements.</p>
      <p>All bosses will have dedicated loot pools and expanded bank spots as promised in tomorrow’s update. A target dummy will be available, and new vending machines will be deployed across all maps.</p>
      <p>Once the patch drops tomorrow, we’ll post the notes.</p>

      <p>Here are the details on Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Pull off the Ultimate Casino Heist</b><br/>Moxxi’s assembling a crew to plunder a derelict space station casino and you’ve proven yourself worthy of joining her ragtag team of “experts.” Successfully battle your way through Hyperion security forces and crazed casino-goers to reach a safe loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Handsome Jackpot</b><br/>This once-thriving destination is packed with unique zones worthy of Handsome Jack’s lavish lifestyle and dirty dealings but has been on total lockdown since his death.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>You Need access to Sanctuary 3</b><br/>To reach The Handsome Jackpot you need to have played enough of the Borderlands 3 story to have access to Sanctuary 3. The enemies and loot aboard the station will scale to your Vault Hunter’s level, ensuring that the casino heist missions and new Crew Challenges are suitably difficult and rewarding.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Beat Casino Security</b><br/>Get a blast from Pandora’s past when you battle the Hyperion forces that outlived Handsome Jack, including never-before-seen enemies and larger-than-life bosses.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>All-New Loot</b><br/>Walk away with Legendary weapons and gear and expand your collection of customization items with Vault Hunter Heads &amp; Skins, Weapon Trinkets, an ECHO Device Skin, and new Emotes.</li>
      </ul>
