      <p>Charles Barkley issued an apology after he told a female reporter for the politics website <i>Axios</i>, "I don’t hit women but if I did, I would hit you." </p>
      <p>The reporter, Alexi McCammond, tweeted about the incident on Tuesday (November 19) night, "Just FYI Charles Barkley told me tonight 'I don’t hit women but if I did I would hit you,' and then when I objected to that he told me I 'couldn’t take a joke.'"</p>
      <p>McCammond explained that she was attending an event that was "off-the-record" that Barkley was at, and the former NBA star spoke about being a huge fan of 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Deval Patrick. When someone from rival  Pete Buttigieg's campaign talked with Barkley, the sports analyst said he also "loved Pete," which led to McCammond chiming in about Barkley's previous remarks about Deval. </p>
      <p>McCammond also responded to Barkley's apology, tweeting, "The comments Charles Barkley made to me are not acceptable. Threats of violence are not a joke, &amp; no person deserves to be hit or threatened like that. Silence only allows the culture of misogyny to fester. And those kinds of comments don’t merit off-the-record protections." </p>
