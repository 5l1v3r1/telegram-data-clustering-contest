      <h1>The Paisley football coach transforming the lives of Syrian kids through sport</h1>
      <h2>The youngsters, who came to Renfrewshire a year ago from war-torn Syria, say they feel football helped save their lives.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:27:23+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author">Carla Talbot, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/carla-talbot/</a></address>
      <p>A year ago, a group of boys arrived in Paisley, having fled the horrors of conflict in Syria.</p>
      <p>They’d lost brothers, sisters and countless family members in the ongoing atrocity.</p>
      <p>Their lives had been torn apart and their hometown brought to its knees.</p>
      <p>They escaped and travelled to Scotland with their families, starting new lives in Renfrewshire.</p>
      <p>And now, one year on, the boys’ lives have been transformed through the power of football.</p>
      <p>For the past year, the children have been playing at St Peter’s Football and Netball Club under the watchful eye of award-winning coach John Kinnaird.</p>
      <p>With some barely speaking English, the team has faced its difficulties, but one year on they have all discovered that football is an international language.</p>
      <p>John, 52, from Paisley, says the experience has highlighted the impact football can have on young people’s lives.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s not just about giving them football.</p>
      <p>“These kids have lost so much before they came here.</p>
      <p>“Every one of the kids that comes to us has had family members who have died in the war in Syria.</p>
      <p>“I asked one of our boys if they would go back to their home in Damascus and he told me that there was nothing to go back to.</p>
      <p>“Every one of these kids has physical and emotional scars, but they don’t appear that way as playing football gives them an outlet.</p>

      <p>“When you see what this gives them, it makes you realise just how important football is for them.</p>
      <p>“These people were forced to leave their homes and come here and start a new life.</p>
      <p>“Football has helped integrate them into life in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“Seeing their faces when they get their kit and feel like they are part of something is amazing.</p>
      <p>“A year on, it is so clear what a difference this has made in their lives.”</p>
      <p>Through the successful Paisley club, the young players have enjoyed fantastic opportunities, travelling around the country to watch the likes of Scotland, Celtic and St Mirren.</p>
      <p>The boys train every week and play every matches on a Saturday.</p>
      <p>The impact the team has had on the group of Syrian boys has prompted John and his partner, Lorna, 43, who is secretary for the club, to open the door to any child in Renfrewshire who wants to take up the sport.</p>
      <p>The successful project now has six coaches on board, along with 21 kids on their 2005 team and 60 kids in the 2014 team.</p>
      <p>John’s mission has proved such a success they now have a waiting list.</p>
      <p>They offer a place to any child who has not had a chance to play, whether it be due to a disability or that their parents can’t afford to pay the fees.</p>
      <p>One player who comes along is 14 and has never been given an opportunity to be on a team.</p>
      <p>His dad died four years ago and his mum is unable to drive him to coaching.</p>

      <p>But, thanks to John’s team, he now has prospects of joining other successful clubs.</p>
      <p>Another young boy who has thrived under John’s coaching has a number of physical and learning disabilities.</p>
      <p>His mum didn’t think he would be able to join any team. John took him on and now his teammates love when he comes to training every week.</p>
      <p>John added: “We want these kids to be able to enjoy playing and have a lifelong involvement in the sport.</p>
      <p>“Whether it be through playing or coming along and helping coach the teams.</p>
      <p>“We also want to improve out facilities so that we have no waiting lists and every child can play when they want to.”</p>
      <p>John’s own battles in life are what have spurred him on.</p>

      <p>He was forced to retire from his job last year due to a heart condition.</p>
      <p>He was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy over a decade ago and was told he would eventually never be able to work or exercise again.</p>
      <p>But, in the years since, John met Lorna, who also has a heart condition, has taken part in the Great Scottish Swim, the London Triathlon and even cycled to John o’Groats to Lands End.</p>
      <p>His efforts at St Peter’s Football and Netball Club have been recognised by the Scottish Football Association and Renfrewshire Council.</p>
      <p>He was also handed the regional and national McDonald’s Grassroots Football Award for the community project.</p>
      <p>He added: “I retired just over a year ago as I have a heart condition.</p>
      <p>“I’m lucky that, in retirement, I have found something that gives me so much.</p>
      <p>“What these boys have done is make me realise how football can change people’s lives.</p>
      <p>“That has made us want to make sure that anyone who wants to play football, but has been unable to for any reason, is given the opportunity.”</p>
