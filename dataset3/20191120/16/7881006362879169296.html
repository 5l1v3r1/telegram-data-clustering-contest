      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: A group of Congress leaders arrived at Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar's residence on Wednesday, amid reports that the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena were close to sealing a deal for government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the crucial meet, NCP’s Nawab Malik said the only way to form the government was by shaking hands with the Uddhav Thackeray-led party, news 18 reported.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Today at 5 pm there will be a meeting between NCP and Congress at Sharad Pawar's Delhi residence... We will be discussing government formation in Maharashtra,” he said.</p>
      <p>Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi has not shown enthusiasm for forging an alliance with the ideologically contradicting party Shiv Sena.</p>
      <p>Experts believe that stitching an alliance with a pro-Hindutva and traditionally anti-South Indian party would damage the image of Congress at the pan-Indian level.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena fell out with all-weather ally BJP, as they failed to agree to a power-sharing deal to form a government in the state.</p>
      <p>On October 24, the declared result of Maharashtra Assembly polls announced BJP as the single-largest party, with 105 seats. In the 288-member Maharashtra Assembly, while Sena secured 56, Congress and NCP won 44 and 54 seats respectively.</p>
      <p>Last week, President's rule was imposed on the recommendation of the Governor BS Koshiyari after not a single party was able to prove numbers for government formation.</p>
