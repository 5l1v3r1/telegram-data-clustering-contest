      <p>Bodexpress is no longer a punchline.</p>
      <p>The colt, a maiden throughout the Triple Crown series who threw jockey John Velazquez at the Preakness Stakes' break, moved his record to 2-for-2 since then with a track record-setting performance on Wednesday at Gulfstream Park West.</p>
      <p>A son of Bodemeister, he led at every call before hitting the wire in 1:35.58 under jockey Emisael Jaramillo in the track’s featured allowance race. The previous Gulfstream West record for the distance was nearly 3/4 of a second slower, at 1:36.25, and had stood since the Calder days in 2001.</p>
      <p>"Never in my life have I had a horse set a track record,” said trainer Gustavo Delgado, who was Venezuela’s all-time winningest trainer before venturing to South Florida 10 years ago. “The way he has come back has been perfect.”</p>
      <p>Off at 4-5, Bodexpress beat one of his top rivals, a local hot horse in Gump, to the first turn, effectively putting that one away. Moretti, a Todd Pletcher trainee once purchased for $900,000, meanwhile made a move through the turn but couldn’t sustain it.</p>
      <p>Up front, Bodexpress never relented, clicking off fractions of 24.09, 47.64 and 1:11.52. With the runner-up 6 3/4 lengths behind at the wire, none were a match for a horse that figures to try stakes again next.</p>
      <p>Delgado said entering Wednesday that Bodexpress, who’s campaigned by Top Racing LC, Global Thoroughbred and GDS Racing, could be seen next in the Dec. 14 Harlan’s Holiday (G3). That race is a logical local prep for the Jan. 25 Pegasus World Cup (G1).</p>
      <p>“The way he was training the past 10 days, he looked like he had a good race coming,” said Gustavo Delgado Jr., who is the assistant trainer for his father’s stable. “He’s more mature now. We want to make him a winning horse. We’ll take it step by step up the ladder.”</p>
      <p>Bodexpress improved his record to 9: 2-3-0 on Wednesday, coming back successfully from an easy maiden win on Oct. 14 at Gulfstream West. Before his Preakness folly, the colt was placed 13th in the Kentucky Derby, ran second to Maximum Security in the Florida Derby (G1) and was nudged out in maiden special weight company by top 3-year-old sprinter Shancelot.</p>
      <p>Off as the 4-5 race favorite Wednesday, Bodexpress, bet down from 3-1 on the morning line, returned $3.60 to win.</p>
