      <p>THE cathaoirleach of Mayo County Council has slammed what he described as 'rumours' in respect of the Christmas lighting scheme in Westport.</p>
      <p>Councillor Brendan Mulroy was responding to claims by Councilloy Johnny O'Malley that funding had not been set aside for the scheme in the 2019 budget while Councillor Peter Flynn also raised concerns about the matter,</p>
      <p>Westport-based Councillor Mulroy said: “I can absolutely say this is totally unfounded. I would urge the people who spread such rumours to take a step back and stop spreading this message.</p>
      <p>“Myself and Councillor Christy Hyland have put together a financial package from council funds that will ensure Westport is looking bright this Christmas and fully lighted up.</p>
      <p>“We also leave the lights on for January as it can be a dark, sad and difficult month for some people.</p>
      <p>"Santa will be coming to Westport and he will see us from the sky. Happy Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Peter Flynn said with revenues up 50% from car parking fees alone this year, he is looking forward to seeing Westport town centre and Quay returning to the standards of years past.</p>
