      <p>Liverpool stars Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson are set to miss this weekend’s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace.</p>

      <p>Salah has been having trouble with his ankle ever since the challenge from Hamza Choudhury against Leicester City last month, which drew criticism from Jurgen Klopp.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian took another knock to it against Manchester City before the international break.</p>
      <p>Robertson has been struggling with his issue for several weeks and has been carefully managed behind the scenes at Melwood <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638">according to a report from The Liverpool Echo</a>.</p>
      <p>Neither player had any involvement for their countries over the international break, but it would appear the Palace game has come too soon.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Robertson the bigger miss</h3>
      <p>Arguably full-back Robertson will be the greater miss for Liverpool this weekend, with Wilfried Zaha known to be a thorn in the side of James Milner down the years.</p>

      <p>Salah is obviously a quality player, but right now he isn’t in full flow like Sadio Mane, and one gets the feeling the Reds will able to manage in the final third without him.</p>
      <p>Klopp can call on Divock Origi or the fit-again Xherdan Shaqiri to fill in, but Palace can cause problems down the Liverpool left against likely Robertson deputy Milner.</p>
