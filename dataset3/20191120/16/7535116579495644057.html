      <p>A 23-year-old bodybuilder who wanted to be like Popeye the Sailor Man had to undergo surgery to remove his arm implants because he could die if he didn’t do so.</p>
      <p>Kirill Tereshin from Russia, who had injected about three litres of petroleum jelly into each arm to bulk up his biceps and triceps, was told that he would need to undergo double amputation if he didn’t get rid of his disastrous implants that had caused his muscles to rot.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10375940/surgeo-russian-popeye-fake-muscles-surgery/?utm_campaign=sunmainfacebook&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1574175291">The Sun</a>, he had injected the petroleum jelly so thoroughly that it spread in the muscle and killed it. He even started having high fever, strong pain and weakness as a result.</p>
      <p>During the surgery, the surgeon had to remove lumps of jelly and pounds of flesh from Kirill’s 24-inch arms. In the process, he managed to remove a massive lump of scar tissue and fragments of muscles that weighed three pounds!</p>

        <b>“Kirill injected about three litres into each arm. It saturated the muscle tissues, blocked blood flow,” the doctor said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“As a result the tissue dies and gets replaced with a scar which is as tough as a tree, you can even knock on it and hear the usual sound.”</b>

      <p>After his initial surgery, Tereshin will have to undergo at least three more and hopefully retain arm movement after, but his fake muscles will be gone.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Petroleum jelly saturates the muscles, under skin tissues and the skin itself,” the surgeon said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“All that has to be removed, but we need to keep the vein, nerves and other functions of the limb.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The surgeon then said that Kirill was “lucky” that the damage had remained only in his limbs and not spread to the rest of his body.</p>
