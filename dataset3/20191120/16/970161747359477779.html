      <p>A Catholic priest was blasted for telling a teenage boy’s funeral that the youngster had killed himself, before condemning him for it.</p>
      <p>Linda Hullibarger had not disclosed her 18 year-old son Maison Hullibarger’s cause of death when the Reverend Don LaCuesta decided to tell a packed church what had happened.</p>
      <p>A lawsuit filed by Hullibarger says LaCuesta ignored her request for a ‘positive, uplifting and loving message,’ at the service in Temperance, Michigan.</p>
      <p>The priest instead ranted about the ‘sin’ of suicide, refused to allow Maison’s family to speak and banned them from participating in a ceremony called the laying of the cloth, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>LaCuesta reportedly said: ‘I think that we must not call what is bad good, what is wrong right.</p>

      <p>‘Because we are Christians, we must say what we know is the truth — that taking your own life is against God who made us and against everyone who loves us.</p>

      <p>‘The finality of suicide makes this all the worse. You cannot make things right again.’</p>
      <p>His revelation about how Maison had died left many who attended the funeral ‘visibly distraught,’ the lawsuit alleges.</p>
      <p>The youngster’s dad Jeff tried to halt the rogue priest on two occasions, only for LaCuesta to rebuff his efforts, court papers say.</p>
      <p>The Hullibargers complained about LaCuesta, and met with Archbishop Allen Vigneron, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/religion/priest-was-wrong-condemn-son-s-suicide-funeral-family-s-n1086481?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma">NBC News</a>.</p>
      <p>But he reportedly told them that ‘he wasn’t there to discuss father LaCuesta,’ and told them to ‘let it go’ when they pressed the issue.</p>
      <p>They have now sued at Wayne County Circuit Court, 50 miles south of Detroit, for an undisclosed amount for emotional distress, misrepresentation and invasion of privacy.</p>
      <p>LaCuesta has since been barred from speaking at funerals at the Archdiocese of Detroit for failing to ‘display appropriate sensitivity to the situation.’</p>
      <p>He apologized shortly after the disastrous funeral, admitting he fell ‘well short of providing them the comfort they so desperately needed.’</p>
      <p>The priest continued: ‘Instead, I added to their pain.</p>
      <p>‘I deeply regret that, and I am sorry.’</p>
      <p>A court hearing has been scheduled in for February 12.</p>
