        <b>Former Miss Ireland Aoife Walsh has said she’s too busy planning her wedding to do Dancing With The Stars.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aoife was due to be a contestant on the RTE One show in January last year but was forced to pull out after she fractured her toe during rehearsals.</p>
      <p>But Aoife said she can’t have another crack at the show this January, as she’s spending most of her time planning her wedding to her long-term boyfriend, Gary McSharry.</p>
      <p>She said: “Well, it wouldn’t suit me this year now. I’m getting married in a couple of months so I’m really busy with that.</p>
      <p>“Planning a wedding is really like a full-time job.</p>
      <p>“My wedding is in Ireland so I have an awful lot happening over the next few months so I’m focusing on that at the moment.”</p>

      <p>The 30-year-old was replaced by model Alannah Beirne, who was booted off the show after nine weeks.</p>
      <p>But Aoife said she wasn’t jealous when Alannah took her place on the show.</p>
      <p>“I was absolutely thrilled to be asked to go on it and I was in it at the start and part of the show.</p>
      <p>“I think obviously from when I broke my toe, it was so unfortunate because I never broke a bone ever in my life.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe the unfortunate timing. When the show went on, there was a part of me that was really sad — but I was really happy for Alannah at the time for her to go and reach her full potential.</p>
      <p>“I just knew if I went on, I wouldn’t reach my full potential and I wouldn’t have done myself any service.</p>
      <p>“I made such good friends with all the pro dancers that season so I was able to still cheer on everyone,” she added.</p>
      <p>Aoife was speaking yesterday as she helped launch Three’s Connected Restaurant.</p>
      <p>The pop-up restaurant, which opens from December, will connect family and friends in Dublin and New York.</p>
