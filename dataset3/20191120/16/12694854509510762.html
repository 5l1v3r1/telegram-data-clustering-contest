      <h1>Sneaky Sennheiser saving – These headphones are better than half price</h1>

        <b>We’ve been on the hunt for the very best Black Friday deals and found this sneaky offering from John Lewis. These Sennheiser Momentun 2.0 in-ear headphones are better than half price at £39.99, but the retailer hasn’t even advertising the saving, making this one savvy offer for those in the know.</b>
      </p>
      <p>When we reviewed the Sennheiser Momentum in-ear headphones they were retailing at £89.99. Sure, they’re not wireless, but Sennheiser is a brand known for great quality and great sound. So, if you want some headphones and haven’t had your headphone jack stolen away from you by a phone upgrade, then these could be a fantastic buy.</p>
      <p>We continually monitor 1,000s of prices to show you the lowest prices, plus a Recommended Deal based on reliable customer service. Buy via us and we’ll earn a small commission from the retailer - a sort of automated referral fee. Our reviewers are always kept separate from this process.<br/>Read more: <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/info/trusted-reviews-ethics-policy-3521647#how-we-make-money">https://www.trustedreviews.com/info/trusted-reviews-ethics-policy-3521647#how-we-make-money</a></p>
      <p>You’ll notice on the John Lewis website that there’s no huge banner screaming “SAVE OVER 50%!” Our best guess is that the retailer believes that the growing popularity of wireless headphones makes this discount a necessity, from their point of view, rather than an amazing deal.</p>
      <p>We politely disagree. Sennheiser are a fantastic audio brand and if you’ve got a headphone jack these will be a treat for your ears.</p>
      <p>Our reviewer, Andrew Williams, had his say on the Sennheisers back in 2017. He said: “These Sennheisers are the first in-ear model to join the Momentum series, which has helped to establish the company as a top choice for people after stylish headphones with better sound quality than Beats.”</p>
      <p>“The excellent bottom-end and sub-bass response that makes the full-size Sennheiser Momentum headphones so thrilling is back with a vengeance… They’re crackers for electronic tracks, and have plenty of treble presence, too… These earphones will please an awful lot of ears. Particularly those who enjoy bass thrills.”</p>

      <p>These headphones really are a fantastic mid-range option and will offer great, affordable sound on all your favourite music and podcasts. Buying through John Lewis also means you get a two year guarantee. What’s not to like?</p>
      <p>We’re not sure how long this offer is expected to last and, due to the low price, there is every possibility stock could run low soon. So, if you fancy a pair of Sennheiser’s, it’s probably best to move sooner, rather than later.</p>
