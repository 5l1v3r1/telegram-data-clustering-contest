      <h1>First Borderlands 3 DLC announced, and it’s about Handsome Jack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:47:40+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:47</time> by <a rel="author">Oscar Dayus</a></address>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a>‘s first narrative expansion has been revealed. The DLC is named Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, and it’s coming “soon”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The add-on will have you join Moxxi’s crew in order to “pull off the ultimate casino heist”, according to an <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/handsomejackpot/">official synopsis</a>. The blurb states: “Moxxi’s assembling a crew to plunder a derelict space station casino and you’ve proven yourself worthy of joining her ragtag team of ‘experts.’ Successfully battle your way through Hyperion security forces and crazed casino-goers to reach a safe loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot!”</p>
      <p>Be aware the DLC requires you to have played enough of the main game’s story to have access to Sanctuary III. “The enemies and loot aboard the station will scale to your Vault Hunter’s level,” Gearbox notes, “ensuring that the casino heist missions and new Crew Challenges are suitably difficult and rewarding.”</p>
      <p>The Handsome Jackpot casino is, of course, named after the series’ popular Handsome Jack villain. The location will contain familiar faces to have outlived the character himself as well as “never-before-seen” enemies.</p>
      <p>The DLC pack’s release date has not yet been confirmed. It’s available as part of the game’s season pass, which costs £40 / $50; it’s unclear if it will also be available separately.</p>
