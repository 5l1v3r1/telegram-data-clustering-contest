      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Michigan-Indiana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:30:34+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Rumors of Michigan’s season ending after the Penn State loss last month have been greatly exaggerated. Since then the Wolverines have gone on a tear, shredding Notre Dame, Maryland and Michigan State with increasingly impressive performances.</p>
      <p>They now head to Memorial Stadium in Bloomington for a showdown with Indiana before their season-finale against Ohio State.</p>
      <p>But the Hoosiers have proven to be a far more resilient team than recent years. At 7-3 they already have their highest win total in over a decade. And considering Indiana just took Penn State to the wire at Beaver Stadium, they’re not to be taken lightly.</p>
      <p>ESPN analyst Bill Connelly has used the SP+ prediction model to determine the likely outcome of the game.</p>
      <h3>The SP+ model predicts that Michigan will beat Indiana, 28-25. Michigan has a 55-percent chance of winning the game.</h3>

      <p>That scoreline and win percentage is pretty small for a Michigan game. But it may also speak to how good Indiana has been at home this year.</p>
      <p>The Wolverines currently boast a 23-game winning streak over the Hoosiers, and are 38-1 against them since 1968. As easy as some of those wins have been in the past, this one seems like it will be more competitive.</p>
      <p>The game will be played at 3:30 p.m. EST and will air on ESPN.</p>
