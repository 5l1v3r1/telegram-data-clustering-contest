      <h1>Club’s manager search ‘really taking off’ after Pochettino Tottenham exit – ‘win-win-win’ arrival</h1>

      <p>So the Tottenham dream is over and Mauricio Pochettino finds himself on the managerial scrap heap.<br/> <br/>Well, not quite. The Argentine’s final 12 months at Tottenham may not have been a dream but they do not quite reduce the five-year stint to nothingness. <br/> <br/>He remains a top coach who plenty of elite teams will be looking at should they need a new manager in the near future. <br/> <br/>Bayern Munich are one such club and, <a href="https://www.bild.de/bild-plus/sport/fussball/fussball/fc-bayern-muenchen-die-wahrheit-ueber-mauricio-pochettino-66151008.bild.html">according to Bild</a>, the pieces could be falling into place for Pochettino to take over next season. <br/> <br/>The newspaper explains that Pochettino is a manager they have looked at for some time and the club’s Sports Director Hasan Salihamidzic is a big fan. In fact, he’s met with Pochettino in the past.<br/> <br/>He’s not the only who would decide Bayern’s next boss, after they sacked Niko Kovac, but having a known fan is in Pochettino’s favour.<br/> <br/>There are other factors that work for him too, such as Bayern not demanding their coach speak fluent German and the fact that of the high-level coaches they are looking at, Pochettino is available on a free after Tottenham’s decision to sack him. <br/> <br/>Thus, Bild propose a strategy to get him to the club next summer. Pochettino signs a deal now but Bayern’s current caretaker, Hans-Dieter Flick, stays in charge until the summer. <br/> <br/>This is seen as a <i>‘win-win-win’</i> scenario as Pochettino would have several months to learn the basics in German and adjust to a new club after five and a half years at Tottenham, Flick can return to his old role and Bayern get a top coach without paying a huge fee. <br/> <br/>As far as Bild are concerned, with Pochettino available, Bayern’s search for a new manager is now <i>‘</i><i>really</i><i> taking off’</i> suggesting his exit from Tottenham may have come at the right time after all.</p>
