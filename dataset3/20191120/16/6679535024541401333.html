      <h2>President Hassan Rouhani accuses rival countries of plotting against Tehran</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:52:06+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday the country’s people had defeated an “enemy conspiracy” behind a wave of violent street protests and were celebrating their victory.</p>
      <p>He blamed the days of unrest on “armed anarchists”, who took to the streets “based on a plot that the region’s reactionary, the Zionists and Americans had hatched,” referring to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the U.S.</p>
      <p>The demonstrations erupted in the sanctions-hit Islamic republic on Friday after an announcement the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200% with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>Motorists blocked major roads in Tehran before the unrest spread rapidly to at least 40 urban centres, with petrol pumps torched, police stations attacked and shops looted.</p>
      <p>Officials have confirmed five deaths, including of three security personnel stabbed by “rioters”.</p>
      <p>Thousands of mourners chanted “Death to America” at the funeral procession on Wednesday for one of those killed, a Revolutionary Guard commander in Shahriar, west of Tehran.</p>
      <p>The UN has voiced alarm at reports of dozens of deaths, and Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed.</p>
      <p>The full extent of the bloodshed was difficult to ascertain given a near-total internet blackout now in its fourth day.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rouhani told the Cabinet that “our people have been victorious against... the enemy’s conspiracy. Those anarchists who came out to the streets were few in number,” he said.</p>
      <p>Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had said earlier also that “the recent actions were security issues, not from the people. “We have repelled the enemy.”</p>
      <p>Days ago Mr. Khamenei had blamed foreign opponents of Iran’s establishment for the unrest — among them the Pahlavi royal family ousted in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the People’s Mujahedeen of Iran group, which Iran considers a “terrorist” cult.</p>
      <p>At the funeral in Shahriar, mourners marched behind a truck carrying his coffin, clutching portraits of the slain Guard as well as posters that read “Down With USA”.</p>
      <p>State television, which rarely shows any signs of dissent in Iran, again aired footage on Tuesday night of the unrest in cities including Tehran and Shiraz.</p>
      <p>The UN human rights office Tuesday said it was alarmed by reports live ammunition had been used against protesters and caused a “significant number of deaths”.</p>
