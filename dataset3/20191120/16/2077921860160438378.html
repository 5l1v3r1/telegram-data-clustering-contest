      <p>“I am really excited to bring our fans a lineup that continues to celebrate both up and coming acts and established powerhouses like the return of headliner The Strokes and first-time headliners The Black Keys and <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/The+Smashing+Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>,” said Tim Sweetwood, founder of the indie music festival, in a statement. “To be able to produce a world-class festival in my hometown of Atlanta year after year is truly special.”</p>
