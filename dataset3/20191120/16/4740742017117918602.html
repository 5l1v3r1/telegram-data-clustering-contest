      <h1>Bristol Rovers' top five most valuable players on Football Manager 2020 - and how to get the best out of them</h1>
      <h2>The popular management simulation was released this week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:50:54+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:50</time> by <a rel="author">James Bishop</a></address>
      <p>Football Manager 2020 came out yesterday and now wannabe managers are now trying to their chosen team to the top.</p>
      <p>With the game highly rated for the way it compiles its stats and valuations of players, many <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Bristol Rovers</a> fans will be keen to find out who the most experience players in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> squad are.</p>
      <p>Here are <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers'</a> five most valuable players on the game.</p>
      <h3>Jonson Clarke-Harris - £2.3m</h3>

      <p>The main man. The striker is by far and a way the highest-valued player for the Gas and it is easy to see why, with his goal record since moving from Coventry City in January making him one of the most prolific strikers in England in 2019.</p>
      <p>Football Manager has rated the 25-year-old at 4 stars with the potential to be 4 and half stars, and his highest attribute is his aggression, which is rated 17/20. So as in real life, make sure Jonson Clarke-Harris is at the centre of your plans for Rovers.</p>
      <h3>Abu Ogogo - £350k</h3>

      <p>The midfielder is the next highest valued player, with the 30-year-old given a consistent set of stats. He’s rated at 3 and a half stars with the comment 'important player in his prime years', so make the most of him. His all-action game should make him well suited for the sort of box-to-box role he plays in real life.</p>
      <p>In his 15 appearances this season Ogogo has scored one goal, but he’ll be in your team to do all the grafting as attributes such as natural fitness, stamina, work rate and bravery are rated as at least 16/20.</p>
      <h3>Victor Adeboyejo - £325k</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3523103.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_JMP_Bristol_Rovers_v_Bromley_RH_077JPG.jpg"/>

      <p>The on-loan Barnsley forward has failed to perform on a consistent basis for the Gas this season, but Football Manager can see the player's potential. He is rated at two-and-a-half stars with the potential to go up to three-and-a-half stars, which means he should be able to do a job in League One.</p>
      <p>In his 13 games this season, the 21-year-old has only scored the one goal (eight of the appearances have come from the bench), but if you encounter that kind of form when you’re playing the game, at least his highest attribute of determination (15/20) should stand him in good stead.</p>
      <h3>Ollie Clarke - £325k</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The skipper gets in at number 4 and it’s no surprise. The Englishmen has the potential to be a four-star player from his three-and-a-half star rating at the start of the game.</p>
      <p>Clarke has 2 assists to his name in the league this season, but it’s aggression that he has been rated the highest on, with 16/20. His personality has also been marked as loyal, so he should give you his full backing as captain.</p>
      <h3>Tareiq Holmes-Dennis - £325k</h3>

        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3537598.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JMP_Bristol_Rovers_v_Swindon_Town_da_029JPG.jpg"/>

      <p>The left-back is the third player rated at this price. Having been out since the start of the season, Holmes-Dennis won't be available on the game for the first few months but, when he is, he is rated as a four-star player, who could potentially get up to four-and-a-half.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has good stats across the board, with pace being the standout, which should combine well with a work rate of 15/20.</p>
