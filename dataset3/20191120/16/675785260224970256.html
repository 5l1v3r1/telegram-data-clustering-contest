      <p>If you need a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> gift for a sweet-toothed loved one, look no further than <a href="https://fave.co/2p7f70Q">House of Fraser</a> .</p>
      <p>Just in time for the festive season, the department store has teamed up with chocolate giant <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cadbury-ltd">Cadbury</a> to launch a new secret Santa workshop this week.</p>
      <p>The Cadbury workshop will be located on the fourth floor of House of Fraser's Oxford Street branch and is open from Thursday, November 21st until Christmas eve.</p>
      <p>It gives shoppers the chance to personalise a selection box with a name of their chouse on the front. Even better, they'll also get to choose the seven chocolate treats that go inside.</p>

      <p>Entry to the festive workshop is free, but it costs £10 to personalise a selection box.</p>
