      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:29:48+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/alice-newcome-beill/" target="_blank">Alice Newcome-Beill</a></address>
      <p>If you've been biding your time for Black Friday savings, your ship has finally come in. Today you can grab an awesome <a href="https://www.newegg.com/asus-rog-strix-gl10dh-nh764/p/N82E16883221574?Item=N82E16883221574">ASUS ROG gaming desktop from Newegg for $1,149.99 ($300 off)</a>. In addition to saving a hot bundle of cash, grabbing this high-end, AMD-centric desktop will also snag you a free 3 months of Xbox game pass for PC, as well as a code that you can redeem for a free copy of The Outer Worlds or Borderlands 3.</p>
      <p>The hardware this PC comes equipped with makes it an ideal candidate for high-level 1440p gaming. Packing an RTX 2060 super backed up with an AMD 3700X and 16GB of DDR4 memory, there are few titles that will present much of a challenge to this beast. A 512GB SSD provides you with ample storage and quick transfer speeds. </p>
      <h3>Gaming desktop deal</h3>
      <p>The sum total of these components is only a couple hundred less than the MSRP, which is rare for a pre-built PC. While building your own PC will almost always be cheaper, the freebies included with this desktop along with a generous 2-year warranty from ASUS makes it a tempting offer indeed.</p>
