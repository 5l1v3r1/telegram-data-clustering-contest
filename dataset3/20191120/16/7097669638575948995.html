      <p>LONDON, Nov 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Extinction Rebellion activists pressing for more rapid action on climate change threats on Wednesday entered a third day of a week-long hunger strikes in 27 countries.</p>
      <p>The strikes, which began Monday, have been in part spearheaded by 20-year-old Giovanni Tamacas, a University of San Diego student, who carried out a solo hunger strike last month in front of the White House.</p>
      <p>“We are hunger striking because we have no choice," he said in a statement, arguing governments and corporations "have criminally and catastrophically failed to tackle the climate and ecological emergency".</p>
      <p>In the United States, activists started their strike by occupying the office of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who protesters said has refused to participate in a filmed interview with movement members.</p>
      <p>Pelosi did issue a statement saying she was "inspired" by young climate activists and that U.S. Democrats were "working relentlessly to safeguard our environment and ensure a healthy, sustainable world for our children".</p>
      <p>In Britain, a handful of activists protested at headquarters of the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties, similarly demanding that candidates in upcoming British elections submit to filmed interviews with Extinction Rebellion members.</p>
      <p>Activists around the world signed up to carry out hunger strikes in countries ranging from the Democratic Republic of Congo to New Zealand, Pakistan and Turkey, Extinction Rebellion organisers said.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion campaigners said the strikes were being carried out in solidarity with people facing worsening hunger as a result of climate change and was aimed at highlighting "the lack of compassion" of many in power.</p>
      <p>“You would rather watch communities be destroyed by the catastrophic hurricanes and floods the climate crisis will bring” than act on the threats, charged 17-year-old activist Sophia Kianni, from Virginia, in a statement.</p>
      <p>The Extinction Rebellion movement uses peaceful civil disobedience to highlight the risks posed by climate change and accelerating species losses in the natural world.</p>
      <p>It has called for governments to set a 2025 deadline to reduce climate-changing emissions to net zero, to declare climate emergencies and to set up citizen assemblies to give people a great voice in political decision making.</p>
      <p>More than 1,800 Extinction Rebellion activists were arrested during two weeks of disruptive street protests in October in London, police said.</p>
