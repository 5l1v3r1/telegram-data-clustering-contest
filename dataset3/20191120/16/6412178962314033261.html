        <b>Liverpool have been dealt a dual injury blow after news emerged that ankle injuries have ruled out two of their vital cogs ahead of Saturday’s encounter with Crystal Palace.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mohamed-salah">Mohamed Salah</a></b> and <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/andrew-robertson">Andrew Robertson</a></b> are the duo deemed unable to compete (via <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11865719/mohamed-salah-and-andrew-robertson-set-to-miss-liverpools-trip-to-crystal-palace?fbclid=IwAR2tx4KYNCM1fa9VsPcfbE1JVkmO3yHj0HcVU6AL7sEnl8S1Z43qqqcYk_w"><i>Sky Sports</i></a>), with a period of rest during the recent international break not proving long enough for their respective injuries to be overcome.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international has been in sparkling form this term, with his performances enough to warrant a place in <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/liverpool-stars-fill-shearer-team-of-the-season-as-other-top-6-stars-snubbed">Alan Shearer’s team of the season thus far</a></b> recently.</p>
      <p>Salah, in contrast, has struggled to replicate the form of his first two seasons, but has still contributed in front of goal with nine goals and five assists respectively.</p>
      <p>The resurgent <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/joel-matip">Joel Matip</a></b> is also a doubt for the <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/liverpool">Reds</a></b>, with the article claiming the centre-half is “likely to miss the game” as he continues his recovery from a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk’s defensive partner will therefore come from either Dejan Lovren or Joe Gomez, with Liverpool hopeful the latter “will be fit to play after he was forced to miss England’s win over Kosovo on Sunday with a knee problem,” sustained via a training ground collision with Kieran Trippier.</p>
      <p>There is good news on the injury front for the Anfield club, however, as club captain <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/jordan-henderson">Jordan Henderson</a></b> is expected to recover from illness, while <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/xherdan-shaqiri">Xherdan Shaqiri</a></b> could improve on his 25 minutes of total football this season if afforded a spot on the bench after overcoming a calf injury.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/milner-takes-cheeky-swipe-at-var-as-liverpool-star-references-armpit-gate">James Milner took to social media to deliver a cheeky swipe at VAR while also referencing armpit-gate.</a></b></p>
