      <p>Singer Lizzo leads the way in this year’s nominations with eight to her name. She is followed closely by Billy Eilish and Lil Nas X with six each.</p>
      <p>The nominees will now be put to a vote among members of the Recording Academy, with winners set to be announced on January 26<sup>th</sup>.</p>
      <p>Recording Academy CEO Deborah Dugan said: “I am in complete awe of the inspiring nominees who have poured their hearts and souls into their craft, and in turn, have provided fans worldwide a year of music that changed us, stirred our emotions and inspired us to do more.”</p>
