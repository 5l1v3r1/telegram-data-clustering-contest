                      <h3>Naseem Shah Test debut</h3>
                      <p>On his maiden Test tour, Shah confronted the upsetting news of his mother passing away back in Pakistan. While there were talks of Shah returning to Pakistan, it was a 48-hour journey to Khyber which made Shah remain in Australia in an attempt to “make his country proud”.</p>
                      <p>While Shah didn’t bowl in the first innings of the first warm-up match, he bowled a testing spell in the second which <a href="https://thesportsrush.com/watch-naseem-shah-troubles-australia-a-batsmen-with-extreme-pace-in-perth/">troubled the Australia A batsmen</a>. If Shah’s performance in the first Test matches his intensity from the warm-up match, be rest assured that he will once again cause problems for the Aussies.</p>

                          <p>While Shah has shown glimpses of falling into the category of Pakistani fast bowlers who make a praiseworthy start to their international career, the upcoming days will throw more light on the same.</p>
