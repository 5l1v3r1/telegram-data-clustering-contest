      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:58:39+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:58</time> by <a rel="author">Loveena Tandon, Ankit Kumar</a></address>
      <p>On a day when lawmakers in India kept themselves busy conferring over the right platform to discuss the WhatsApp snooping case, India Today TV travelled all the way to Paris to track down the company at heart of the snooping scandal.</p>
      <p>Israel-based cyber tech firm NSO Group, which was found missing from Israel has now been tracked down by India Today TV, in France.</p>
      <p>NSO Group, which had gone into some kind of hiding since the snooping scandal broke out, has been finally tracked down. This is the first time that NSO officials were confronted on camera over the questions of snooping on activists in India.</p>
      <p>The NSO officials in Paris were asked repeated questions over the snooping issue and Pegasus spyware by India Today TVâ€™s Loveena Tondon.</p>
      <p>NSO Officials were seen evading questions asked by India Today crew and kept running away from the cameras. The NSO team which was in Paris to give a demonstration of their latest technology said that they are only allowed to give a demonstration to government officials.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson of the Israeli firm tried to dodge the questions by asking us to send our questions on email.</p>
      <p>NSO is the company that created Pegasus spyware, used to crack WhatsApp's security walls and snoop on at least 1400 users globally, including 121 users in India.</p>
      <p>The Ministry of Electronics and Information Broadcasting on Wednesday informed Parliament that WhatsApp had informed it of the breach in May and assured that it has plugged the vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>Later in October, WhatsApp officially informed the 121 individuals whose mobile phones were targeted by Israeli spyware in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections this year. It included prominent human rights activists, journalists and lawyers.</p>
      <p>In its latest reply, submitted on Wednesday, WhatsApp said that it regretted the breach.</p>
