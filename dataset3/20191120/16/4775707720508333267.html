      <p>Mad Moxxi's got a grudge against Handsome Jack, saying he stole her plans and used them to build Handsome Jack's casino aboard a cruise ship in space. She wants you to join her crew to pull of a heist, in which you'll go up against Hyperion security forces and the inhabitants of the casino, to bag all of the loot in The Handsome Jackpot's vault and officially even the score. It seems that Moxxi has more of a history with Jack than the trailer lets on; the two were married at one point, making Handsome Jack's theft of her plans especially insulting, particularly when considering that Jack's got a bar on his casino called Foxxxi's. The reveal came during the third episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=minXu9Kszks&amp;feature=youtu.be">The Borderlands Show</a>, where the presenters say it'll be around seven hours of gameplay. Plus, they say that Handsome Jack himself will be "sort of" back. We <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39701/borderlands-3-dlc-handsome-jack">spoke</a> before about how it would be difficult to have Handsome Jack back because he had, well, <i>died,</i> but in the teaser for the DLC, a statue and a hologram of him were shown — and again in the reveal trailer. The presenters say you'll be spending more time with Jack in some way, and it would make sense if he did appear as an antagonist and obstacle to Moxxi's heist.</p>
      <p>They say in The Borderlands Show that this DLC can be treated as endgame campaign content, or you can go straight into a new playthrough and treat it as a (lengthy) side quest after starting anew. All you'll need to have done to access The Handsome Jackpot is have played enough of Borderlands 3's story to have access to Sanctuary III. All the enemies and loot on the station will be scaled to your Vault Hunter's level, and your task will be to loot it and take over. The main target, the safe, is full of Eridium, cash, and brand-new Legendary loot: weapons, gear, Vault Hunter Heads and skins, Weapon Trinkets, an ECHO Device Skin, and new Emotes. The DLC has new enemies and bosses to go up against, as well as all of the Hyperion forces left over.</p>
      <p>The Handsome Jackpot comes out on December 19th.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
