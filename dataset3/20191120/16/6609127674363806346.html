      <p>Neil Martin told the court Walker had been “vindictive” towards her and that his ex was involved in an abusive relationship with him.</p>
      <p>It came as Dinse escaped jail for the bloody Edinburgh nightclub attack which left Walker needing 11 stitches after he was taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>The footie had been glassed by his then partner after she spotted him in a romantic clinch in trendy club Lulu.</p>
      <p>But Mr Martin said Dinse was “remorseful” about the attack and had been “under the influence of alcohol at the time”.</p>
      <p>Mr Martin told the court she had spent a “harrowing” weekend in the cells following the incident.</p>
      <p>And he added that Dinse is now seeking help from the Women’s Aid Organisation.</p>
      <p>He said: “The narrative in the case was that the complainer Mr Walker was standing speaking to another female but what can be seen clearly [in the CCTV] is that he is kissing another female in the nightclub.</p>

      <p>“This does not justify what she did but it adds some context. But the relationship was clearly toxic and is now over.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Adrian Cottam said: “The information that has come out since does not excuse your actions which could have been even worse for Mr Walker but fortunately they weren’t.”</p>
      <p>The sheriff ordered the receptionist to be placed on an offenders supervision requirement for the next 12 months as an alternative to custody.</p>
      <p>Previously prosecutor Alistair Millar gave a short narration to the court and said Dinse was in a relationship with Walker at the time of last December’s assault.</p>
      <p>Mr Millar said: “This incident took place in a nightclub where the accused has witnessed the complainer speaking to another female.</p>
      <p>“Her reaction to this was to hit him over the head with a glass.”</p>
      <p>The fiscal added Mr Walker’s injury was described as “a deep laceration to the head which was five centimetres in length” and required 11 stitches.</p>
      <p>Walker recently retired from football due to a serious knee injury.</p>
      <p>He is remembered for scoring the opening goal for Aberdeen against Bayern Munich in a UEFA Cup match at Pittodrie.</p>
      <p>He also played in the English Premiership for Middlesbrough at just 17 and captained England at the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Walker also played for Watford, Bournemouth, Rotherham and Indian side Bengaluru and was captain of Scottish League Two side Edinburgh City after joining the club in 2017.</p>
