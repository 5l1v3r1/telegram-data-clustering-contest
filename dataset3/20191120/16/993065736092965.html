      <p>TWO men are being questioned by police after an armed gang smashed their way into a house in north Belfast.</p>
      <p>Police said they received a report shortly after 7.30pm yesterday that "a number of men had arrived at a house in the Alexandra Park Avenue area and were smashing their way into the property and were armed with weapons including a suspected firearm and a hammer".</p>
      <p>"There were three males in the house at the time - two teenagers and a man aged in his fifties.</p>
      <p>"Police subsequently arrested two men, aged 30 and 33, on suspicion of aggravated burglary.</p>
      <p>"They both remain in custody this morning assisting us with our enquiries.</p>
      <p>"This was a frightening ordeal, and it's fortunate none of the occupants were injured.</p>
      <p>"However, they have been left shaken.</p>
      <p>"As we continue with our enquiries, I want to appeal to anyone who was in the area last night around this time and who saw a number of males acting suspiciously, or any vehicles being driven in a suspicious manner, to get in touch with our detectives."</p>
