      <p>If you wondered what Mike Andrzejewski has been up to since his <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/08/02/seabar-restaurant-sets-closing-date-in-mid-august/">much-loved restaurant Seabar closed</a>, buy a ticket to Nov. 25 at Cantina Loco.</p>
      <p>At his place at 191 Allen St., Andrezejewski is presenting a one-night-only menu of refined Mexican-inspired cuisine, a special event amid its usual tacos and burritos.</p>
      <p>Chorizo flautas, filled with housemade sausage, and snapper ceviche with lime, charred onion, and herbs, are the appetizers.</p>
      <p>Esquite, sweet corn with spicy crema, herbs and chiles, and avacado Caesar, are the vegetables. The main event is lamb shank with Mexican stylings, then there's dessert.</p>
      <p>Seats, available through <a href="https://m.bpt.me/event/4442767">Brown Paper Tickets</a>, are $87.50 including tax, tip, and service fees.</p>
