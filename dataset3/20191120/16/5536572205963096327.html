      <p>No matter what, you must always get the shot. That is the creed of the photojournalist.</p>
      <p>Chamberlain Smith definitely lived by that motto.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the UGA photographer who got knocked unconscious on the Auburn sidelines over the weekend, took to Twitter and tweeted out the last picture she took right before she got hit.</p>
      <p>It was an extreme closeup of Georgia running back Brian Herrien.</p>

      <p>Herrien himself also gave his thanks after the photo was released.</p>

      <p>Smith suffered a concussion, a black eye and some cuts to her face during that collision.</p>
      <p>Herrien would go on to score on a five-yard screen pass on the very next play to give Georgia a 13-0 lead 20 seconds before halftime. The No. 4 Bulldogs went on to defeat the No. 16 Auburn Tigers by the score of 21-14.</p>
