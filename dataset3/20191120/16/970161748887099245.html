      <p>The first season of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fortnite-battle-royale/">Fortnite</a> Chapter 2 is going to end up as the longest in the game’s history, as Epic release the v11.20 patch notes.</p>
      <p>It’s over a month now since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/fortnite-chapter-2-live-now-can-finally-play-fortnite-10921531/">Fortnite Chapter 2 began</a> and its first season was due to end sometime next month, but it’s going to be a much longer wait than fans are used to until the second season begins.</p>
      <p>Epic Games has announced that season 1 has been given an ‘extension’, meaning that chapter 2 won’t kick in until February and last year’s Christmas event, the 14 Days of Fortnite, will be longer than before.</p>
      <p>What exactly the Christmas extras will involve is not yet clear, but <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/chapter-2-season-1-extension">Epic are promising</a> ‘new game features, free rewards and a live experience that you won’t want to miss’.</p>

      <p>The 14 day events over Christmas and during the summer are when Fortnite developers are given time off, so whether this means they’re getting an extra long break or not remains to be seen.</p>

      <p>They’re certainly still working now as they’ve just release the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/battle-royale-update-whats-new-in-11-20">v11.20 patch</a>, which brings back daily challenges and the Bandage Bazooka.</p>
      <h3>Fortnite Chapter 2 v11.20 patch notes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily Challenges are back and can be completed for XP! Up to three at a time are available, and once a day you can replace a Challenge for another.</li>
        <li>In the Locker, you can now filter your items by the Season they were introduced in. To filter your items by Season, enter the Season name in the search bar. Use terms like ‘season 5,’ ‘season x,’ ‘chapter 2 season 1,’ etc.</li>
