      <p>Prince Andrew is reportedly considering a second interview to set the record straight over his controversial <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York, 59, said in an interview with Newsnight he "kicks himself" every day for remaining friends with Epstein after his conviction.</p>
      <p>But the Queen's second son received a huge backlash over the conversation, with Good Morning Britain's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/piers-morgan-rips-into-prince-andrew-for-desperate-toe-curling-interview-about-friendship-with-paedophile/">Piers Morgan branding it "desperate"</a> and "toe curling" to watch.</p>

      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein">Vanity Fair</a> has reported that the royal is looking to do a second interview as he wants to "put right" things he failed to mention in the first.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, an insider said: "There are rumors swirling that Andrew wants to do another interview. Andrew hasn't drawn a line under it.</p>
      <p>"He wants the chance to put right the things he didn't say. Newsnight gave him the chance to show some remorse. He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say. It was an open goal, he didn't grasp it, and I think he sees that now."</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-considering-second-interview-20920558">Mirror</a> reported that a spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said they were "not aware" of any official plans for a second interview.</p>
      <p>In his Newsnight chat, the duke told journalist Emily Maitlis he cannot recall the woman who has accused him of sleeping with her on three occasions, including in 2001 when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the programme on Twitter, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">GMB</a> presenter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> said it was among the "most astonishing" interviews he had ever seen.</p>
      <aside>He wants the chance to put right the things he didn't say.</aside>
      <p>He Tweeted to his 6.9 million followers: "This is one of the most astonishing interviews I've ever watched. Brilliant forensic dissection by @maitlis - desperate, toe-curling [bleep] from Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>"Why on earth did he do this? Insane."</p>
      <p>But from Prince Andrew's perspective, the interview went well - and he is even reported to have told <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/the-queen-looks-pretty-in-pink-in-new-photo/">the Queen</a> it was a "great success".</p>
      <p>Someone claiming to be close to the duke told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10365159/prince-andrew-interview-bbc-epstein-news/">The Sun</a>: "The duke went to church with the Queen [on Sunday] and was heard telling her it's all been a great success."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Speaking further, the source said the duke "thinks he's done the right thing" and "put the criticism to rest".</p>
      <p>But others couldn't see it. The duke was even the butt of some jokes on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
