      <p>Jose Mourinho was on Wednesday appointed Tottenham's new manager to replace the sacked Mauricio Pochettino, with the club languishing 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United manager signed a contract until the end of the 2022/23 season, the north London club said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, 47, transformed Spurs' fortunes after arriving from Southampton in 2014 and although he failed to win a trophy he took the club to the Champions League final for the first time in their history just six months ago.</p>
      <p>But the Argentine was sacked on Tuesday, with Tottenham struggling in the league after picking up just three wins from their opening 12 games.Â </p>
      <p>This season they were knocked out of the League Cup by fourth-tier Colchester United and suffered an embarrassing 7-2 defeat at home to Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters," said Mourinho, who has won domestic titles in a record four different countries.</p>
      <p>"The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me."</p>
      <p>Spurs Chairman Daniel Levy said: "In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician.</p>
      <p>"He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room."</p>
      <p>Spurs hailed their new boss, saying in their statement: "Jose is one of the world's most accomplished managers having won 25 senior trophies."</p>
      <p>He won Champions League titles with Porto and Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old Portuguese won three Premier League titles over two spells in charge of Chelsea and returned to England to manage Manchester United in 2016.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was sacked last December following a poor run of results and has been out of work since, most recently working as a TV pundit.</p>
      <p>His first match in charge will be the London derby away to West Ham on Saturday.</p>
