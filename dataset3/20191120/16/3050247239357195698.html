      <h1>US Federal Reserve Exploring Digital Dollar and Its Effect on Monetary System</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:06:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:06</time> by <a rel="author">Ana Alexandre</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/irs-laughs-off-coinbase-users-surveillance-conspiracy-in-tax-reporting-case">United States</a> Federal Reserve System is exploring the development of a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-central-bank-branch-set-on-fire-crypto-community-follows-events">central bank</a> digital currency (CBDC) and what issues and risks it could potentially pose.</p>
      <p>Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell provided a response to U.S. Representatives French Hill and Bill Fosters’ request on whether the Federal Reserve plans to launch a national digital currency, financial services reporter Zachary Warmbrodt <a href="https://twitter.com/Zachary/status/1196942798081138688">tweeted</a> on Nov. 20.</p>
      <p>In the letter, Powell set forth the Federal Reserve’s views on the creation of a CBDC, emphasizing that, although the agency is not currently developing a CBDC, it has assessed and continues to evaluate the costs and benefits of such an initiative.</p>
      <p>Powell revealed that the agency is conducting its own small-scale, research-focused experiments to gain hands-on experience and better understand the opportunities and limitations of CBDCs.</p>
      <h3>CBDCs raise a range of legal concerns</h3>
      <p>Powell said that prior to issuing a CBDC, the Federal Reserve has to address a number of legal questions, including monetary and payments policies, financial stability, supervision and operational issues, and their vulnerability to cyber-attacks. Powell continued saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“If it is designed to be financially transparent and provide safeguards against illicit activity, a general purpose CBDC could conceivably require the Federal Reserve to keep running record of all payments data using the digital currency [...] and sometimes that raises issues related to data privacy and information security.”</blockquote>
      <p>Lastly, Powell noted that a number of design features should be considered for the development of a CBDC, including the governance of the outstanding stock of such a currency, the necessity of a Federal Reserve payment system to conduct <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/libra-network-logged-over-30-projects-over-past-two-months-of-testing">transactions</a> and the issue of anonymity in regard to owning and transacting a CBDC.</p>
      <h3>Representatives’ response to the letter</h3>
      <p>In response to Powell’s letter, Rep. Hill expressed enthusiasm that the Federal Reserve is exploring whether there is a point to issuing a CBDC, and <a href="https://twitter.com/Zachary/status/1196976686757232641">said</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“This decision would have far-reaching implications on every aspect of America’s monetary policy and requires a deep level of analysis to ensure proper implementation.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rep. Foster <a href="https://twitter.com/Zachary/status/1196995365653876736">said</a>: “My main concern is that we are not caught flat-footed by fast moving developments in other countries that may put our economy at a competitive disadvantage and threaten the primacy of the U.S. dollar.”</p>
