      <p>Quando Rondo opened up to VladTV about growing up in Savannah, GA and being raised by his great aunt after CPS took him out of his home at 2-years-old. He explained that his leg was burned by an iron during an argument between his parents, and when Quando's mother took him to the hospital two days later, he was taken away by CPS. Quando Rondo explained that he wasn't close to his dad's side of the family, so his living situation was somewhat strange when he was old enough to assess the situation.</p>
