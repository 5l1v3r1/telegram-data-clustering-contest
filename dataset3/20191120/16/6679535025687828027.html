      <h1>ED attaches property worth ₹117 cr. of horse trainer who duped Mysore Maharaja's taxidermist</h1>
      <h2>He is accused of cheating a deceased British national</h2>

      <p>The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached two immovable properties — around 220.19 acres worth ₹117.87 crore — owned by horse trainer Michael Floyd Eshwer under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.</p>
      <p>According to officials, Eshwer allegedly forged documents, including the death certificate of British national the late Edwin Joubert Van Ingen, who was a taxidermist for the erstwhile Mysuru royal family, to claim ownership of the property. This includes Mr. Ingen’s coffee estate in Wayanad, Kerala, and another property in Nazarbad, Mysuru. The ED also attached 70 trophies and rosewood furniture.</p>
      <p>The CID had taken up a probe in 2017 into Eshwer’s dealings following a Supreme Court order. Investigation had revealed that the accused learned about Mr. Ingen’s property, which had been gifted to him by the Maharaja of Mysuru for his services. When Eshwer also found out that Mr. Ingen was single, he allegedly took advantage of his old age and on his death, claimed that he had been adopted by the taxidermist. Investigations revealed that Eshwer had committed the fraud in connivance with others, the ED said in a release.</p>
