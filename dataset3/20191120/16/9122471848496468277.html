      <h1>ESPN Analyst Releases Score Prediction For Nebraska-Maryland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:18:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://thespun.com/nebraska-cornhuskers">Nebraska Cornhuskers</a> head into Saturday’s game against Maryland in pure desperation mode. A loss eliminates them from bowl eligibility for the third year in a row, and a second under Scott Frost.</p>
      <p>But as bad as the Huskers have been during their four-game losing streak, their game against the 3-7 Terrapins offers a chance to get back on track. Maryland has lost five games a row.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Bill Connelly used the <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/28099946/sp+-rankings-week-12-battle-1-loss-teams">SP+ prediction model</a> to determine the likely outcome for the game.</p>
      <h3>Based on the model, Nebraska has a 58-percent chance of winning at Maryland Stadium this weekend. The Huskers are projected to win the game, 31-27.</h3>
      <p>The SP+ model’s score projection lines up with the four-point spread at most sportsbooks at the moment. From Connelly:</p>

      <p>Nebraska is a four-point favorite heading into this game. That’s a pretty unconvincing spread against a Maryland team on a five-game losing streak that’s given up at least 34 points in each of those losses, even on the road.</p>
      <p>It will be a battle of struggling defenses to be sure. But with Maryland already out of bowl contention, the Terrapins can make life extremely difficult for the Huskers in their own backyard.</p>
