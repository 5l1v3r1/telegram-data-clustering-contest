      </blockquote>
      <p>And many of us are more than happy to jump on board the latest trend, keen to swap the usual Nordmann Fir with a unique talking point instead. </p>
      <p>This year, many households are opting for the parasol tree with Argos reporting a 5900% increase in the number of orders for their model over the past year.</p>
      <p>At its simplest, the parasol is a small version of a traditional<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/"> Christmas</a> tree with an elongated trunk. It’s a great choice for families with cats or toddlers as the lack of low branches means fewer broken baubles. Many retailers offer it in green, frosted or even pre-lit.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, other tree-styles are capturing the imagination. Over at John Lewis &amp; Partners, Assistant Christmas Buyer Mandy Rush says something more full-bodied is in vogue; she’s noticed “a change in trends for sweeping branches that fall to the ground to create a full Christmas look.” Rush adds that the <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fjohn-lewis-partners-sanctuary-spruce-pre-lit-christmas-tree-7ft%2Fp4033065"> John Lewis’ Sanctuary Spruce Christmas Tree</a> is the one John Lewis customers are opting for this year.</p>

        <figcaption>While the parasol Christmas tree is not to everyone's taste, it offers a more practical version to the traditional Christmas tree</figcaption>

      <p>With so many incarnations of the humble Christmas tree to choose from, which will you go for this year?</p>
      <h3>1. Half Christmas Tree</h3>
      <p>Anyone who’s limited on space will love the<a href="https://www.longacres.co.uk/christmas/artificial-christmas-trees/7-foot-artificial-christmas-trees/tree-classics-2-1m-7ft-green-half-artificial-christmas-tree-84-579-558/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgeie1JGh5QIVgoxRCh3yBAi5EAQYBSABEgLlGPD_BwE"> half Christmas tree</a>, which can be found in<a href="https://www.christmastreeworld.co.uk/the-6ft-arbor-vitae-fir-half-tree?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_cSnud_i5QIVSIfVCh1PzAcjEAQYAyABEgLlCPD_BwE"> Christmas Tree World (£39.99)</a> and<a href="https://www.longacres.co.uk/christmas/artificial-christmas-trees/7-foot-artificial-christmas-trees/tree-classics-2-1m-7ft-green-half-artificial-christmas-tree-84-579-558/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgeie1JGh5QIVgoxRCh3yBAi5EAQYBSABEgLlGPD_BwE"> Longacres (£64.99)</a>. It stands snug to the wall which means you can still have the illusion of an extravagant tree at half the size. No more wasting baubles at the back where people can’t see them, either…</p>
      <h3>2. The Upside Down Tree</h3>

        <figcaption>The Upside Down Tree is designed to save space while still being as large as any other Christmas tree</figcaption>

      <p>The show-stopping upside down tree, found on <a href="http://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/710-53481-19255-0/1?ff3=4&amp;pub=5575316386&amp;toolid=10001&amp;campid=5338145993&amp;customid=customid&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.co.uk%2Fi%2F383216163012%3Fchn%3Dps%26norover%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkrid%3D710-134428-41853-0%26mkcid%3D2%26itemid%3D383216163012%26targetid%3D487744086883%26device%3Dc%26mktype%3Dpla%26googleloc%3D9045903%26poi%3D%26campaignid%3D7643169333%26mkgroupid%3D78014891941%26rlsatarget%3Dpla-487744086883%26abcId%3D1139576%26merchantid%3D7098214%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMIpP2P4Pjk5QIVQcreCh1qiw5HEAQYByABEgKIfPD_BwE">Amazon (£79.99)</a> and <a href="https://www.whitestores.co.uk/upside-down-half-glacier-christmas-tree-7ft-black.html?wgu=4803_116019_15735709471721_d142765c06&amp;wgexpiry=1577458947#fo_c=575&amp;fo_k=85499770361729e5dd22761e404fd835&amp;fo_s=gplauk?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIubSSsvqg5QIVRbTtCh2Zfw-dEAQYASABEgLkgvD_BwEhttps://www.whitestores.co.uk/upside-down-half-glacier-christmas-tree-7ft-black.html?wgu=4803_116019_15735709471721_d142765c06&amp;wgexpiry=1577458947#fo_c=575&amp;fo_k=85499770361729e5dd22761e404fd835&amp;fo_s=gplauk?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIubSSsvqg5QIVRbTtCh2Zfw-dEAQYASABEgLkgvD_BwE">White Stores (£119.99)</a> was made famous by Karl Lagerfeld when he brought it to Claridge’s in 2017. </p>
      <p>Perfect for festive rule-breakers, it means you can have a tree as big as you like without having to compromise on floor space. Quite what you do about the tree topper though, we don’t know...</p>
      <h3>3. The Black Tree</h3>

        <figcaption>A black Christmas tree goes against traditional Christmas decorative norms</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A black Christmas tree, such as this one from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/SAFRI-Artificial-Christmas-Colour-Decoration/dp/B0774VXCRV/ref=asc_df_B0774VXCRV/?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Amazon (£38.99)</a>, is the ultimate conversation starter. It was one of Instagram’s top ranking tree styles in 2018, and offers a firm break from tradition. Try dressing it in neon for ultimate wow.</p>
      <h3>4. Starburst Tree </h3>

      <p>Starburst Christmas trees have a heavy focus on LEDs. Just like this one from <a href="https://www.ukchristmasworld.com/products/12m-gold-starburst-tree-with-496-warm-white-leds.html?refid=plappc&amp;utm_source=GoogleBase&amp;utm_media=Product+Search&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlv_gq-7k5QIVQbDtCh0ygA6cEAQYBiABEgKKbfD_BwE&amp;refid=plappc&amp;utm_source=GoogleBase&amp;utm_media=Product+Search&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlv_gq-7k5QIVQbDtCh0ygA6cEAQYBiABEgKKbfD_BwE">UK Christmas World (£99)</a>, Starbursts have lights sprouting from every branch, and won’t need any more decorating.</p>
      <h3>5. The Wooden Tree</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>The Wooden Tree is the stylish no-fuss alternative to the traditional Christmas tree</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A carpet covered in pine needles isn’t to everyone’s taste, which is where wooden trees come in, like these made of Oak by <a href="https://www.notonthehighstreet.com/abfurniture/product/oak-christmas-tree?DGMKT=FID__TID_pla-340936504022_PID_266781_CRI_340936504022&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMImuHB-p3l5QIVA7DtCh3JrQWvEAQYBSABEgIrOPD_BwE">A+B Furniture (£169)</a> and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6091&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fuk%2Flisting%2F626506340%2Falternative-oak-christmas-tree%3Fgpla%3D1%26gao%3D1%26%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_campaign%3Dshopping_uk_en_gb_ds-a-Home_and_Living-home_and_living-home_decor-ornaments_and_accents-christmas_trees%26utm_custom1%3D2919687a-217c-4dc8-aa02-9ed5ff25d680%26utm_content%3Dgo_6479345238_79396306442_380917574387_pla-371215830677_c__626506340engb%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMI_Lrcvej45QIVyrHtCh1XzwM0EAQYFCABEgJqYfD_BwE">Natural Wood Company (From £95)</a>. This is the stylish no-fuss alternative interior design aficionados have been waiting for. And, since they aren’t plastic, they’re probably better for the environment too.</p>
      <h3>6. The Sticker Tree </h3>
