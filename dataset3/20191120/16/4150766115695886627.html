      <p>Cambodia and Barbados have established diplomatic relations to promote mutual understanding and strengthen friendship and cooperation among the people of both countries, a joint communique of the permanent mission of the two countries to the UN said.</p>
      <p>The diplomatic relations at ambassadorial level was established under the provision of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April 18, 1961.</p>
      <p>It was formed “based on the principle and purposes of the charter of the UN and international law, particularly on the respect for and promotion of international peace and security, equality among states, national sovereignty, independence, international treaties, territorial integrity, and non-interference in the internal affairs of states”.</p>
      <p>The communique was signed by Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Permanent Representative of Cambodia to the UN Ke Sovann and Henrietta Elizabeth Thompson of Barbados.</p>
      <p>Kin Phea, the executive director of the Royal Academy of Cambodia’s International Relations Institute, said the diplomatic relations with Barbados will enable both states to support each other on various matters at international level.</p>
      <p>“It is an extension to the relations between Cambodia and other countries, even though Barbados is just a small Island.</p>
      <p>“In diplomatic relations, the more friends we have, the better it is. This is in line with the government’s principle of increasing foreign friends and strengthening domestic affairs based on independence,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Even though it is a small country, we can support each other on regional and international matters. It is better to get to know a new friend than to make foes,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation spokesman Koy Kuong could not be reached for comment.</p>
