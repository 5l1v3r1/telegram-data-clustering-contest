      <p>Following the schedule, <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/features/realme-5s-launch-specifications-x2-pro-blind-order-sale-vivo-s5-miui-11-updates-whatsapp-features-ai-2133863">this afternoon</a>, OPPO’s sub-brand launched the Realme 5s smartphone in India. The phone uses a <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/18/realme-5s-with-snapdragon-665-soc-appears-on-geekbench/">Qualcomm Snapdragon 665</a> processor and a 5000mAh capacity battery. And the starting price is INR 9999 (about $139).</p>
      <p>Those who are not aware that the Realme 5s is the third product in the Realme 5 series. It comes after the Realme 5 and Realme 5 Pro. To recall, the Realme 5 was launched in India in August alongside the Realme 5 Pro. Not surprisingly, the configuration and appearance of our protagonist are similar to that of Realme 5. But it’s the lower variant of the mentioned variant.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, the Realme 5s is equipped with a 6.51-inch screen with a resolution of 1600 x 720. This phone uses a water drop design. In terms of hardware, as said above, it sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor. The latter is accompanied by up to 4GB of memory and 128GB of storage space, which can be further expanded to 256GB through a microSD card.</p>

      <p>In terms of photography, the rear quad-camera consists of a 48-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL GM1 main sensor, a 119-degree 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 2MP telephoto lens, and a 2MP super macro lens. The front camera has a 13MP resolution.</p>
      <p>Well, all these features have become mainstream for mid-rangers. But how the Realme 5s is going to compete in this niche? The answer is ‘the price’. The phone’s 4GB+64GB version costs 9999 Indian rupees, and the 4GB+128GB version is priced at 10999 Indian rupees (about $153). This handset will go on sale on November 29.</p>
