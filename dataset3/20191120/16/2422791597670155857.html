      <h1>Putin says U.S. 'political dramas' diverting focus from Russia</h1>

      <p>MOSCOW - Russian President Vladimir Putin says he's pleased that the "political battles" in Washington have put on the back-burner accusations that Russia interfered in U.S. elections.</p>
      <p>"Thank God," he told an economic forum in the Russian capital on Wednesday, "no one is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. elections anymore; now they're accusing Ukraine."</p>
      <p>Some Republicans have used the public hearings to tout a discredited conspiracy theory that blames Ukraine, not Russia, for interfering in the U.S.'s 2016 presidential election.</p>
      <p>In the impeachment hearings, Democrats in Congress say U.S. President Donald Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate former U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden while withholding U.S. military aid to Kyiv, and argue that may be grounds for removing Trump from office.</p>
