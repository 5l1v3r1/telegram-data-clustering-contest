      <p>Members of the Kuruba community staged a protest under the aegis of Halumatha Mahasabha in the city on Wednesday against J.C. Madhuswamy, Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs, for his alleged uncourteous behaviour with members of the community at Huliyar in Tumakuru district.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Eshwarappa, a functionary of the Mahasabha, said that during the discussion on the dispute related to naming of a circle in Huliyar recently, Mr. Madhuswamy had spoken in a derogatory manner against the members of Kuruba community and in a rude manner with Eshwaranandapuri Swamiji, a Kuruba community seer, present there. The behaviour of Mr. Madhuswamy was unbecoming of a Minister, the protesters said and demanded the Chief Minister to drop him from the Cabinet.</p>
      <p>The protesters also submitted a memorandum to the office of Deputy Commissioner in this regard.</p>
