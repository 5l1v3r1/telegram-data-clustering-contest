      <h1>Leicester Tigers boss Geordan Murphy provides Ellis Genge contract latest amid reported Bristol Bears interest</h1>
      <h2>The former Bristol prop is out of contract at Welford Road at the end of the season.</h2>

      <p>England prop Ellis Genge's club future appears to still be up in the air.</p>
      <p>Last week <a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/features/34191/ellis-genge-set-to-snub-bristol-and-stay-a-leicester-tiger/">The Rugby Paper</a> reported Genge's former club <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rugby">Bristol Bears</a> had made an offer for the Leicester Tigers loosehead to return to Ashton Gate next season but it fell short of expectations.</p>
      <p>The publication reports he is close to signing a new three-year deal at Welford Road.</p>
      <p>Genge, 24, was a a part of England's Rugby World Cup squad which reached the final in Japan before losing 32-12 to South Africa.</p>
      <p>Despite missing out on the final squad during the course of the tournament Genge reminded everyone of his devastating ball carrying with a run against the USA which went viral on social media.</p>

      <p>Genge, who now has 14 caps for England, left Bristol for Leicester Tigers midway through the 2015/16 season, following a series of problems both on the field, and off it.</p>
      <p>The forward who grew up on an estate in Knowle West felt he had to leave the city after getting arrested several times.</p>
      <p>There were also unconfirmed reports of a training ground bust-up with then coach Andy Robinson.</p>

      <p>However Bears director of rugby Pat Lam, who arrived after the frontrower had moved on, has made no secret of the fact that he is a big admirer of the prop and would like to bring him back to the West Country.</p>
      <p>Speaking back in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/we-would-love-bring-ellis-2874503">May as a guest on BT Sport's Rugby Tonight</a> , Lam said: “Would we like Ellis Genge to come home? Of course we would.”</p>
      <p>In the past Genge has also expressed his desire to one day return to Bristol.</p>
      <p>Bristol currently have four senior loosehead props at the club in Samoan international brothers James, 25, and Jordan Lay, 27, Yann Thomas, 29 and Jake Woolmore, 28.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday Leicester Tigers director of rugby Geordan Murphy confirmed contract negotiations with Genge are "ongoing" with the Midlands club keen to keep hold of one of their stand-out stars.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/leicester-tigers-winger-jonny-could-3554323">Leicester Mercury</a>, Murphy said: "We have been in contract negotiations with Ellis since before the World Cup, as with some of the other guys who there has been huge speculation about.</p>
      <p>"When the guys were away we stepped down our chat in order to let them focus on the World Cup.</p>
      <p>"Ellis has come back and has been very vocal about telling us he wants to re-sign and contract negotiations are ongoing."</p>
      <p>However the situation has been confused further by regular social media user Genge's tweet to BBC Radio Leicester journalist Adam Whitty.</p>
