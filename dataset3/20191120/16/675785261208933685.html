      <p>A baby <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/babies">boy</a> died from skull fractures after his dad allegedly dropped him on the floor repeatedly while trying to comfort him.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old father, named as Artem, was believed to be drunk when he came home and heard his six-month-old son crying.</p>
      <p>Taking little Nazar from his cot, he allegedly dropped him several times as he tried to comfort him.</p>
      <p>The child was found with numerous bruises on his face following the alleged incident in Vovchyk, central Poltava, Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Artem confessed to causing his son's death, was arrested and taken into custody, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The alleged incident happened on November 6 when Artem came home after attending a birthday party.</p>

      <p>His wife Tetiana, 20, went outside to park his car in the courtyard near their apartment block.</p>
      <p>She came back 10 minutes later and entered the bedroom to check on Nazar who she earlier left sleeping in his cot.</p>
      <p>But the mum reportedly saw her child lying motionless on the floor as her husband was snoring on the bed.</p>

      <p>Terrified, she rushed to Nazar who showed no signs of life, reports said.</p>
      <p>Tetiana told local media: ''I took him in my arms and realised that he was not breathing. I started panicking. My hands were shaking.''</p>
      <p>The mum ran to Mykola Nadakhovsky, a paramedic living next door who immediately rushed to the scene.</p>

      <p>Mr Nadakhovsky said: ''When I examined the boy, he was already dead.</p>
      <p>''He had no pulse, no reflexes. I tried to bring him back to life but it was too late.</p>
      <p>''I saw bruises on the child's face, fresh blood in his nose and called the police.''</p>
      <p>Officers arrived on the scene and interviewed Artem. The man allegedly said "he repeatedly dropped the crying baby on the floor while trying to comfort him then went to sleep".</p>
      <p>Police have reportedly launched a criminal case for murder against Artem.</p>
      <p>He was arrested and taken into custody for a two-month pretrial period.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> spokeswoman Ludmyla Ivashuk said: ''The father came home drunk and heard the baby's crying. He took the child from the crib and started comforting him.</p>
      <p>''In the process, the man dropped the boy to the floor several times.</p>
      <p>''According to forensic examinations, the baby died from a head trauma aggravated with multiple skull fractures.''</p>
      <p>The suspect father faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.</p>
