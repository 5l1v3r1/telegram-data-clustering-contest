      <p>The CW has released a new promo for the upcoming Episode 6 of the eighth and final season of <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/arrow">Arrow</a></b>.

      <p>After being double-crossed by Lyla (guest star Audrey Marie Anderson), Oliver (Stephen Amell) finds himself facing a life or death situation that seems very familiar. Laurel (Katie Cassidy) has the opportunity to make amends with the past.</p>
      <p>David Ramsey directed the episode written by Onalee Hunter Hughes and Maya Houston. You can watch the new <b>Arrow </b>Episode 8.06 promo in the player below. Then check out the new set of promotional photos from the episode.</p>
