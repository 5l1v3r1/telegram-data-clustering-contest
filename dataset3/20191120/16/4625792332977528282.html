      <h1>Sondland on telling Trump Zelensky 'loves your ass': We communicate in 'four-letter words. In this case, three'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:24:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-opening-statement-from-gordon-sondland">Gordan Sondland</a> said he and President Trump often use profanity when they speak, drawing laughs from those attending his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-intelligence-committee-holds-impeachment-hearing-featuring-gordon-sondland">public impeachment hearing</a>.</p>
      <p>The disclosure came as Sondland, 62, was being questioned about a July 26 phone call between him and Trump, which embassy official David Holmes <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/embassy-staffer-says-sondland-told-trump-zelensky-loves-your-ass-and-will-do-anything-you-ask-of-him">claims he overheard</a>. Holmes told investigators that while at a restaurant in Kyiv, he heard Sondland tell Trump that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “loves your ass.”</p>
      <p>Speaking before the House Intelligence Committee on Wednesday, Sondland said that while he didn’t recall the specifics of what was said, Holmes’s description of the call made sense.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, that sounds like something I would say,” Sondland said to laughter. “That’s how President Trump and I communicate. A lot of four-letter words. In this case, three-letter.”</p>

He maintained he did not have direct evidence that those conditions were directly tied to military aid to the country.</p>
      <p>Last year, Trump nominated Sondland for the role. He <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/erry-2018/07/cdbfd3400b3583/portland-hotelier-who-gave-1-m.html">donated</a> $1 million to the president’s inaugural committee in 2017.</p>
