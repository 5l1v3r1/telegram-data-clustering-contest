      <h1>Poundland ditches 'everything's £1' slogan as they change prices across stores</h1>

      <p>Poundland has ditched their ‘everything’s £1’ slogan – because um, everything isn’t £1 anymore.</p>
      <p>Yes, the store where you didn’t need to ask the price is changing.</p>
      <p>Rather than just offering everything for £1, items will be priced between 50p and £5 with some special items available for £10.</p>
      <p>The store has been selling special deal items outside the normal £1 range since 2017 but this is a wider roll out with more items spread throughout.</p>
      <p>75% of things will still be £1 but it means that they can offer a wider range of items, with some needing to be priced lower and some higher than £1 but they still say it will be good value.</p>
      <p>The move comes after a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/13/poundlands-new-pricing-structure-means-youll-be-asking-how-much-is-that-10561266/">successful trial in 24 West Midlands stores</a> but it has now been rolled out across the UK.</p>
      <p>They’ve also introduced clothing ‘shop-in-shops’ in around 300 stores and fresh and frozen ranges in five stores in Yorkshire and Derbyshire.</p>
      <h3>What products are on offer in the new Poundland price structure?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Matchmakers for 75p (£1.75 Sainsburys)</li>
        <li>Walkers 24 packs of crisps for £3 (£4 Sainsburys)</li>
        <li>L’Oréal Elvive Fibrology shampoo for £2 (£2.49 Boots; £2.75 Asda)</li>
        <li>Comfort Blue Skies fabric conditioner for £4 (£8 in Wilko)</li>
        <li>Nivea Men Fresh Power 0% deodorant for £1.50 (£3 Sainsburys)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Barry Williams, Poundland managing director said<i>: ‘</i>We’ve introduced simple pricing in time for Christmas so we can offer customers even more choice and even better value for money.</p>

      <p>‘Our shoppers love the amazing value we provide and now we can begin bringing that value on wider ranges that they now can find in stores for the first time.</p>
      <p>‘Our team of talented buyers has moved heaven and earth to bring these ranges to store in time for Christmas and I’d like to thank them for all their hard work.’</p>
