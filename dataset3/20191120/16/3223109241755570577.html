      <h1>Google Stadia’s Launch Seems Soft</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:15:19+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia launched this week… well, kind of. Yes, it’s technically true you can now pay real money for Google’s ambitious video game streaming platform. But between the latency issues, limited software library, and various other restrictions, right now Stadia feels like an early access beta rather than a fully finished product. In our in-depth <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/review-google-stadia-just-isnt-finished-yet-1810564/">Google Stadia review</a>, we recommend you hold off on buying it for now. Many other critics felt similarly.</p>
      <p>And it seems like customers have been taking that advice. While it’s all very anecdotal for now (the product literally launched yesterday) it sounds like Google Stadia sales are looking pretty soft.</p>
      <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/">Kotaku’s</a> Jason Schreier has a pretty stellar track record when it comes to reporting insider games industry news. So while this is technically speculation, when he says something we tend to believe it. And on Stadia’s launch day he was already out here saying Stadia was a “monumental flop” with pre-order numbers “below expectations.” Pre-order numbers are a metric Google could track even before launch.</p>

      <p>Maybe this is why Stadia’s launch lineup doubled overnight? We’ve been <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/why-were-skeptical-of-google-stadias-gaming-future-1779294/">skeptical</a> of the service from the beginning, and like I said our review ended up confirming many of those suspicions. But don’t expect Google to just completely drop Stadia quite yet. Cheaper and potentially more appealing versions of the service are on tap for next year, along with just more games. And really console launches are rarely great. Still, if Stadia does get sent to the Google Graveyard eventually, we wouldn’t be surprised.</p>
