      <p>A teacher adopted one of her own students after the boy’s mother died of cancer.</p>
      <p>Kerry Bremmer decided to take care of Jake Manning, who has Down syndrome, after his single mom Jean succumbed to terminal breast cancer on last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Bremmer, from Ayer in Massachusetts, said she ‘fell in love with (Jake) instantly’ when they first met four years ago.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/ayer-teacher-kerry-bremer-adopts-student-with-down-syndrome-after-his-mother-died-of-cancer/29850427">WCVB</a>: ‘As she got sicker that year, I just thought: “What is she going to do?”‘</p>
      <p>Bremmer discussed Jake’s predicament with their husband Dave – then made his ailing mother her incredible offer.</p>

      <p>Recalling the conversation, Bremmer said: ‘If you need a backup plan for Jake, then our family is happy to make him part of our family.</p>

      <p>‘She said: “I’ll sleep better tonight than I have in a long time.”‘</p>
      <p>Jake then spent time with Kerry, Dave and their three children Kaitlyn, Kristen and Jonathan, who fell in love with the youngster’s happy and joyful nature.</p>
      <p>Dave said: ‘When I first met him when he was in Kerry’s class, it was fun.</p>
      <p>‘But when we first decided to do this and I met him again, he said: “You’re the dad? You’re Dave the dad?”</p>
      <p>‘That was it for a very long time. I was Dave the dad.’</p>
      <p>Jean Manning died last Wednesday after taking a nap following a chemotherapy treatment.</p>
      <p>Jake said: ‘My mom went to heaven. She’s always in my heart.’</p>
      <p>And while heartbroken by Jean’s loss, Bremmer is delighted to have Jake as part of her family, saying: ‘We shared our boy and she will live on here in this house.’</p>
      <p>A GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/memorial-for-jeanie-to-benefit-jake?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=m_pd%20share-sheet&amp;fbclid=IwAR3JIPKVWHZrVa3kCh36G1FprVbrnm3CdNF5vQHXak8DFrl1i-D8U2zrhEw">page</a> has been set up to help support Bremmer and her newly-extended family.</p>
