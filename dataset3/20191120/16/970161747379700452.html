        <b>The life of any of Charlie’s Angels may seem like the life of a supermodel with a side job of being a world-renowned hit man, but keeping bright red lipstick intact while roundhouse kicking villains down isn’t an easy task.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Melanie Hughes-Weaver, the woman behind every make-up look in the new film, took every precaution to make sure the stars of the movie looked flawless no matter how the actresses felt and what scenes were being done.</p>
      <p>With scenes going from extreme winds to high heats, it’s no wonder Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinksa and Elizabeth Banks got ill at some point during production.</p>

      <p>Melanie told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>: ‘There were times when there was extreme winds and we had to put goggles on them in between takes to protect their eye make-up because it was so cold and windy.</p>
      <p>‘There were times when the girls had colds and had red lips on. You’re there trying to like allow them to take care of the necessities of having a cold and not mess up their red lips but that definitely was a challenge.</p>
      <p>‘You know, dry skin and runny noses.’</p>
      <p>Elizabeth plays Bosley, a former Angel who became one of Charlie’s assistants, all while directing, writing and producing the movie.</p>

      <p>The multi-talented star ended up with a worryingly-high fever but powered through each scene because she’s obviously an Angel in real life.</p>
      <p>‘There was a scene where Banks was working and she had a 103 fever (39.5°C) and was directing and acting in the scene’, Mel continued.</p>
      <p>‘There was an explosion and Sabina (played by Kristen) was being treated for some wounds. Banks’ character comes walking in.</p>
      <p>‘Like, she’s got a 103 fever and literally laying down (between takes) and we were trying to determine whether we should shut down production. She was so ill and going for it while on camera.’</p>
      <p>Charlie’s Angels has become known for their over-the-top disguises and sultry make-up which we fell in love with since the first series came out in 1976.</p>

      <p>The outfits range from the 2000 movie’s sexy lederhosen (never forget) to 2019’s disco glam, and we are not over it.</p>
      <p>Red lipstick will always be associated with a fierce woman, and the Angels is all you need as proof, but the stunning looks didn’t come easy.</p>

      <p>Melanie shared: ‘I didn’t always get the time to bring someone back to their trailer do their makeup during a change of scenes. Sometimes we’re doing it in a parking lot or in the back of a car or a van in the middle of the street. We didn’t get that much luxury.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t know if [the weirdest place I did make-up] was on the side of a race track or the back of an ambulance or when they were laying down on the floor while they were trying to look at notes or even while Elizabeth was conducting business meetings because sometimes you’ll be talking to the producers/production design/cinematographer.’</p>
      <p>Considering the intense fight scenes, and impressive car chases, we sometimes forget the crew are doing the same types of things.</p>
      <p>She continue: ‘Everyone’s coming in for meeting and you’re trying to touch her up. Sometimes it was even while she was asleep. If that’s what I got when she could get a five minute cat nap, I’d have to do it and wake her up for the final part when you gotta do lips.’</p>
