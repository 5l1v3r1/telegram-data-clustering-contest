      <h1>Kannada-medium students cross the language divide</h1>
      <h2>They deliver speeches in English, leaving audience thrilled</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:17:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sathish-G-T-1357/" target="_blank">Sathish G.T.</a></address>
      <p>As the students spoke in fluent English on the dais, their parents in the audience were in raptures. Equally thrilled were officers of the Education Department, as students of Kuvempu Centenary Government Higher Primary School at Haralahalli near here performed skits, delivered speeches, and narrated short stories in English.</p>
      <p>Students from classes 1 to 7 of the Kannada-medium school participated in the “English Fest” with enthusiasm, hosted entirely by students. Gangothri, Revanth Gowda and Manya of class 6 and Dhruvitha of class 7 shared the responsibility of introducing the guests and fellow students performing on the occasion.</p>
      <p>Bindu, a class 5 student, narrated a story of the thirsty crow, while her classmates Yogeshwari, Rajeshwari, and Diskhith performed a skit to spread a message on the importance of growing plants and keeping the campus green.</p>
      <p>K.T. Krishne Gowda, professor of English, who inaugurated the programme, appreciated the students and the teachers who trained them.</p>
      <p>“I was surprised to see the confidence among students,” he said.</p>
      <p>D.T. Puttaraju, principal of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), said students of government schools get quality education and they could compete with those studying in private schools.</p>
      <p>“I wish the public appreciate the efforts of teaching faculty in our schools and join their children to these schools,” he said. He also thanked Graam Sugamya Shiksha, a trust, for joining hands with the Education Department to provide quality education in government schools. The trust has adopted 12 schools, including the one at Haralahalli in Hassan district, and helped particularly with English and computer skills.</p>
