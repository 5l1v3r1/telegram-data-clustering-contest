      <p>A Grade 11 pupil at a Mossel Bay school has received private counselling after she reported that a fellow pupil had raped her, according to authorities. A video of the incident has apparently been distributed.</p>
      <p>Western Cape education spokesperson Bronagh Hammond said the school was informed of the incident on Monday morning and contacted the police.</p>
      <p>Provincial police confirmed on Wednesday that a 17-year-old was arrested for a rape case and that he appeared in court on Tuesday. Another suspect of the same age has not yet been arrested.</p>
      <p>"The alleged perpetrators are a Grade 12 [learner] and a Grade 11 learner," said Hammond.</p>
      <p>"The incident did not happen in school – it was on the weekend at a private party. The school is cooperating with the police investigation."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/western-cape/matric-pupil-held-after-video-of-girls-rape-at-party-is-shared-with-learners-37561069">IOL</a>, the girl fell asleep at the party and when she woke up, she discovered that she had been undressed and raped. Her friend apparently showed her footage of the incident.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyvoice.co.za/news/matric-boy-vas-for-rape-37619979?fbclid=IwAR0Zc9o7G6VyBpE6Xv88Iv1wM_dQ62PzX-AgHHsV7fcZ8Xz1ZRucudXb6lQ">Daily Voice</a> reported that a cellphone was used to take the footage and that it was shared with several people.</p>
      <p>"These allegations are, of course, extremely concerning and further support will be made available to the victim on request," said Hammond.</p>
      <p>"We have not yet seen a copy of the alleged video and appeal to learners or anyone who does receive it, if indeed true, to not distribute it."</p>
