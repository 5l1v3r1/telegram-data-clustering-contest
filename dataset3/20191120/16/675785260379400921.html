      <h2>Stacey Andrew had to wade through the crowd at the FlyDSA Arena in Sheffield in 'just her bra' after her shirt went up in flames and her brother has pleaded for help in tracking down the 'scumbag' who threw the flare</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T16:26:16+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 16:26</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/, Barnaby Kellaway</a></address>
      <p>A woman was "scarred for life" after she was badly burnt after a "scumbag" launched a flare into the crowd at a packed Liam Gallagher concert.</p>
      <p>Rock fan Stacey Andrew says she suffered severe burns across her chest and arms as well as damage to her hair.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old's enraged brother Leon vowed to get justice and pleaded for help in hunting down the "scumbag" who threw the flare as he "needs to pay for what he has done".</p>
      <p>Leon has made an appeal for help to catch those responsible, as he claims they "could have taken my sister away from me and my family".</p>
      <p>Stacey, of Boston, Lincolnshire, was near the front of the stage when she was struck by the lit projectile, which ignited her clothing and burned her skin underneath.</p>
      <p>She was rushed from the venue, the FlyDSA Arena in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.</p>

      <p>Stacey told the BBC: "The flare hit my head and fell down my top, at first I didn't realise what had happened until people shouted.</p>
      <p>"It looks like someone let a firework off on my chest."</p>
      <p>Stacey was near the front with her partner Callum Mutton and said she could see people with flares behind her and to the right.</p>
      <p>Police said they received a report of a 21-year-old man and a woman he was with being injured by the flares.</p>

      <p>Stacey said: "I didn't realise what had happened then people started patting me. My shirt was in flames and a man ripped it off.</p>
      <p>"People were shouting, 'She's on fire!'"</p>
      <p>She claims she had to make her way to security staff as they did not come to her aid in the crowd and there was "no proper first aid".</p>
      <p>She said: "It was so embarrassing, I was just in my bra.</p>

      <p>"The Red Cross saw us but their tap wasn't running so they had to find water. The on-site nurse was good and covered my dignity as best as she could.</p>
      <p>"I'm scared I'm going to be scarred for life."</p>
      <p>The BBC reports FlyDSA Arena offered Stacey a taxi but her partner chose to drive them to hospital.</p>
      <p>A number of other concertgoers have taken to social media to say there were lots of flares set alight in the crowd throughout the concert on Monday.</p>

      <p>Stacey claimed security staff did not personally check everyone on the way in, but bags were searched.</p>
      <p>She told the BBC: "Everyone who bought drinks from Arena had plastic cups but a lot of lads had their own cans."</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> post shared with Gallagher, Stacey's brother Leon wrote: "Anyone who has information on the scumbag who decided to light a flare and throw it into the crowd and set my sister on fire I want his name or information on him because he needs to pay for what he has done."</p>

      <p>Leon said he was at home when he got a call to say his sister was in hospital.</p>
      <p>"She will be scarred for the rest of her life," he said.</p>
      <p>"All I've been trying to do is post everywhere I can on social media to find out who did it.</p>
      <p>"Those flares shouldn't of been in there." [sic.]</p>
      <p>He added: "I want justice for the pain they have caused my sister because she will now have scars for the rest of her life."</p>

      <p>The horrific incident is reported to have taken place at the start of the concert while support act DMA were playing.</p>
      <p>Another Facebook user shared a story from her children's experience at the same gig.</p>
      <p>Sharon Gibb Vanes posted: "My 23-year-old son took my 12-year-old daughter as she loves Liam.</p>
      <p>"We bought her the tickets for her birthday and she was so happy last night we purchased the tickets seated as we knew under-14s couldn't be in standing.</p>
