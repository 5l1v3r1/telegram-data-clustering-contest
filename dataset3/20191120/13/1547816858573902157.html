      <p>Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz’s recent fight on Bigg Boss 13 was a huge one, which had turned into a physical brawl. Once best friends, things have now turned bitter between them. While the two have fought on the show even earlier, they later patched up. But looks like there’s no coming back from this violent fight which had escalated to a point that the housemates had to intervene and separate them. While people have different opinions about the fight that went down, Bigg Boss ex-contestant Dolly Bindra has now taken a stand on the matter.</p>
      <p>Just recently, Bigg Boss 3 winner Vindu Dara Singh sided with Sidharth Shukla and criticized Asim for using the same provocative tactics that the others used in the house. Now, Dolly Bindra also took to Twitter and in typical Munna Bhai style, asked Asim to get well soon. She has also supported Sidharth in this fight and his Tweet read, “Jealously is a terrible disease, get well soon :) This tweet is for asim  Get well soon asim  The hatred towards a friend  Yesterday's episode #SiddhartShukla #BB13.” <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-fans-question-makers-for-beeping-out-asim-riaz-s-gun-threat-to-sidharth-shukla-video-inside/5dd51cf387fb571eff7e4296">ALSO READ: Bigg Boss 13: Fans Question Makers For Censoring Asim Riaz’s Threat To Sidharth Shukla - VIDEO INSIDE</a></p>
