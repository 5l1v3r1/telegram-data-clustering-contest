      <p>Work began to redevelop the current academy ground in September 2018, with the ambition to combine the Reds’ senior and youth squads under one roof.</p>
      <p>This will in theory ease the pathway from academy to first team, with those shining in the under-23s and under-18s setups readily available to the manager if and when required.</p>
      <p>At present, this involves last-minute call-ups and journeys from Kirkby to Melwood, which restricts the academy coaches in terms of forward-planning.</p>

      <p>A new video from Liverpool this week has highlighted the progress made on the new site since work commenced a year ago, with the facility still on track to meet its deadline for the summer of 2020.</p>
      <p>The training ground will be 9,200 square meters, which includes two gyms, a full-sized sports hall, a pool and a hydrotherapy system.</p>

      <p>With the main structure complete in May, work is underway on the interior of the facility, along with marking out three full-sized pitches in the outdoor area.</p>

      <p>The images provided are impressive, showing the scale of the site, which should be a major upgrade on those currently in place at both Melwood and Kirkby.</p>
      <p>While the redevelopment is intended to include the first team and academy, <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/liverpool/liverpool-on-track-to-move-to-new-kirkby-training-ground-for-202021-preseason-a4291966.html">the <i>Evening Standard</i></a>‘s David Lynch reports that <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> has encouraged a “clear physical partition placed between the area used by U23s players and their senior counterparts in the new building.”</p>

      <p>“Although they will no longer need to be called up to Melwood as is the case currently, the club’s academy talents will use a separate entrance also shared by visitors and different changing facilities in Kirkby,” Lynch writes.</p>
      <p>“That measure is aimed at ensuring that no young player starts to believe they have ‘made it’ simply through proximity to the first-team setup.”</p>
      <p>The redevelopment is believed to be worth £50 million, and should be in use for pre-season 2020.</p>
