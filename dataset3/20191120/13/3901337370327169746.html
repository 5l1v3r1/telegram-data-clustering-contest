      </p>
      <p>While some reports in the football fraternity have suggested that the Buccaneers could be planning to make technical team changes, the Siya crew has been reliably informed that Mokwena is still in charge of the team, but had been given some time off, due to not feeling well. </p>
      <p>As confirmed by sources, Mokwena only returned to Pirates training yesterday (Tuesday) to help the team to prepare for the match against Rise and Shine at Orlando Stadium next Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The coach had not been at the club since the loss to Chiefs on the 09th of November. </p>
      <p>“Rulani is back at training since yesterday,” confirmed the source.  </p>

      <p>It should further be reported Pirates had been given three days of leave from Monday to Wednesday after the Soweto Derby, meaning that Mokwena had only been absent from duty on Thursday and Friday last week.    </p>
      <p>Pirates’ assistant coach Fadlu Davids was in charge of the training sessions during Mokwena’s absence.           </p>
