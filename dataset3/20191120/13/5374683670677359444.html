      <p>A fire which broke out Wednesday afternoon west of Jerusalem has forced residents of a Jerusalem-area town to evacuate their homes.</p>
      <p>Authorities say ten firefighting teams, aided by air units from the Elad Aerial Firefighting Unit, have been dispatched to combat a blaze which broke out next to Mevasseret Tzion, just west of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>The fire began in a valley next to Hashoshana Street in Mevasseret Tzion, but quickly spread, due in part to strong winds, as well as unseasonably dry weather.</p>
      <p>Police units have also been dispatched to the area to evacuate residents from the threatened areas.</p>
      <p>A second fire has also been reported near the youth village of Shefya, on the northern edge of the coastal plain, near Haifa.</p>
      <p>The fire has prompted evacuations in Shefya and Zichron Yaakov, just southwest of Shefya.</p>
