      <h1>Construction of data centres in Ireland to generate billions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:53:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:53</time> by <a rel="author">Kirsten Doyle</a></address>
      <p>The Irish tech industry has built 13 new data centres since 2017, and has grown operational capacity by more than 50% during that time. </p>
      <p>Back then, there were 41 operational data centres, with an estimated 420MW of power capacity. This year in Q3, there are 54 operational data centres, with a power capacity of 642 MW.</p>
      <p>So said David McAuley, rounder &amp; CEO of BitPower, speaking at the Global Data Centre Forum, hosted by Enterprise Ireland in Dublin this week.</p>
      <p>He painted an optimistic picture of the Irish data centre landscape, based on the <a href="https://www.hostinireland.com/report">Host In Ireland Q3 2019 Report Update</a>, saying that during the last two years, between six and 10 data centres were under construction during any single quarter. </p>
      <p>“Right now, there are 10 data centres under construction with an average size of 20MW each, representing an investment of approximately €1.5 billion."</p>
      <p>McAuley added that aggregated data shows an investment of around €1.3 billion per year, which is expected to continue over the next three to four years. In this context, investment refers to buildings, on-site infrastructure, power and cooling equipment, and does not include any other ICT hardware such as servers and racks.</p>
      <p>He said 2019 saw several planning approvals in progress, and noted faster turn-around times, with developers applying for planning permission in one quarter and receiving planning approval by the next quarter.</p>
      <p>Currently, there is a pipeline of 31 facilities of approximately 20MW each with planning permission, and another five data centres in the planning application process. </p>
      <p>“The 54 data centres that are currently in Ireland have a combined capacity of 642MW of grid-connected power. The 31 facilities in the pipeline are expected to add another 600MW, the 10 under construction an additional 200MW.”</p>
      <p>This, he said, will present challenges for the power grid, although the move to the cloud has seen far more efficient use of energy. </p>
      <p>“Data centres built ten years ago needed huge cooling units that are not needed in today's facilities, many of which use free cooling, and no cooling towers.”</p>
