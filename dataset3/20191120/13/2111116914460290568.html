      <p>Huawei is finally bringing its Kirin A1-powered connected devices to India, starting with <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/reviews/huawei-watch-gt-2">the Watch GT 2</a> in the first week of December.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month,<a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/kirin-a1-powered-wireless-huawei-products-coming-soon-to-india"> Huawei India confirmed</a> that its connected device ecosystem would be coming to India shortly. All of these are powered by the new Kirin A1 chipset, which specializes in connection quality without taking a toll on battery life. </p>
      <p>The company has now confirmed that the Huawei Watch GT 2 will come to India in the first week of December. It was originally unveiled in September, alongside <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/reviews/huawei-mate-30-pro-review">the Mate 30 series</a>. One of its most notable features is two weeks of battery life on a single charge, which is unheard of in the world of smartwatches.</p>

      <p>It achieves that with a hardware and software combination, implementing the Kirin A1’s efficiency and opting to use an in-house operating system called Lite OS instead of Wear OS. This supposedly enables the 445 mAh battery to last for 14 days.</p>
      <p>The Watch GT 2 comes in two sizes, a 42mm dial, and a 46mm, both of which sport AMOLED displays spanning 1.2-inches and 1.39-inches diagonally.  It is also waterproof up to 50m, with 5ATM certification.</p>
      <p>In terms of features, we are looking at step tracking, heart rate monitoring, sleep monitoring, Huawei TruRelax, and all-day activity tracking.</p>
      <p>In the European market, the Huawei Watch GT 2 is priced at €249, which converts to about Rs 20,000 for the 46mm variant.</p>
