      <p>Ramsey marked his first Wales start in more than a year by firing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-giggs/"><b>Ryan Giggs</b></a>' side to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Juventus midfielder scored twice in the 2-0 victory over Hungary in Cardiff as Wales secured their Euros return after reaching the semi-finals in 2016.</p>

      <p>Ramsey's performances won him a place in the official Euro 2016 team of the tournament, but his time in France ended on a sour note as missed the last-four defeat to Portugal through suspension.</p>
      <p>Asked if he has unfinished business with the Euros, Ramsey replied: "Yes. It was obviously a disappointing ending to the Euros for me by missing out on the semi-final.</p>
      <p>"Those things happen and now I have the opportunity to go out there and express myself again.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully we can have another successful run like we did last time.</p>

      <p>"We had the best time of our lives in France so we wanted to make sure we got there again.</p>
      <p>"I missed a lot of this campaign but I've chipped in now and it's worthwhile."</p>
      <p>Wales' only previous appearance at a major tournament before Euro 2016 came at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden.</p>
      <p>They reached the quarter-finals before losing 1-0 to Brazil, the goal scored by a 17-year-old called Pele.</p>
      <p>Qualification for Euro 2016 under Chris Coleman was regularly described as a "once in a lifetime" experience, as over 30,000 Wales fans made their way to France and football fever gripped the nation.</p>

      <p>But euphoria was soon replaced by the more familiar feeling of despair as Wales missed out on the 2018 World Cup after losing a decisive qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>"To do back-to-back Euros is something special," Ramsey said.</p>
      <p>"It was very disappointing not to make the World Cup.</p>
      <p>"But we learned from the experience of that night to bring it back here, and to win in the manner that we did was a nice experience.</p>

      <p>"To experience this again now is going to be some journey."</p>
      <p>Ramsey had sat out Wales' Euro 2020 qualifying campaign through injury until coming on as a second-half substitute during the 2-0 win in Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But his double moved him onto 16 goals for Wales, taking him past the great John Charles on his country's all-time scoring list and into joint-seventh place.</p>
      <p>Wales are now set to be placed in either Group A or Group B at Euro 2020.</p>

      <p>With Italy being a host nation and playing in Group A, Ramsey could line up against some of his Juventus team-mates in Rome's Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>"I'm enjoying my time over there at the moment so that would be nice," Ramsey said.</p>
      <p>"I haven't even thought about where we are going to be playing yet.</p>
      <p>"It's about enjoying this now and then we will come to all of that over the next few weeks."</p>
