      <p>Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India decided to reduce the overall time taken for rights issue to 31 days from the current 55, a move aimed at making the process more efficient.</p>
      <p>Besides, the regulator has made Applications Supported by Blocked Amount facility as a mandatory mode of payment for all investors applying to shares on rights basis, SEBI said in a statement issued after the board meeting.</p>
      <p>Payment through ASBA facility is investor friendly and enables faster completion of the post issue process.</p>
      <p>In addition, it has introduced dematerialised and trading of rights entitlements on stock exchanges.</p>
      <p>The new norms are aimed at significantly reducing the timeline for the completion of rights issue, which will ultimately benefit the shareholders.</p>
      <p>The regulator said shareholders holding shares in physical form will be required to provide details of demat account for credit of rights entitlements .</p>
      <p>SEBI has decided to reduce the "timeline for completion of the rights issue from the current T+55 days to T+31 days".</p>
