      <h1>Thrifty mum transforms old Christmas tree into stunning new design for just £40</h1>
      <h2>Each year mum Tina Robinson creates a brand new design for the same Christmas tree - and this year's masterpiece is entirely dog-friendly</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:50:38+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author">Kerry Elsworth and Hannah Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Every year mum-of-three Tina Robinson creates a unique Christmas experience for her three children - but she does it using the same tree.</p>
      <p>Tina, 40, spends three weeks creating a different themed festive masterpiece – from a Minion-themed tree inspired by a family holiday to Florida to an angel-shaped tree in memory of her grandparents.</p>
      <p>The mum, from Preston, Lancs, has also turned the 5ft tree – which she originally bought in 2015 – into a living room homage to Christmas film The Grinch in the past too.</p>
      <p>And this year, Tina spent one hour a night for three weeks perfecting her recent masterpiece – a dog-friendly tree hanging from the ceiling where it can’t be reached by newly adopted French Bulldog, Caesar.</p>

      <p>She said: “Caesar can’t be trusted yet, so I’ve attached hooks in the ceiling and hung each branch up and put his kennel underneath so he can’t reach it.</p>
      <p>“I make all sorts of stuff. I’ve always been quite crafty and I love Christmas.</p>
      <p>“I got the idea when I went to Florida, I came back and made a Minion tree. Nobody wants the same Christmas decorations every year.</p>
      <p>“I usually spend £40 on the decorations, I always get new baubles to match the theme but it’s the same tree under the decorations.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to be different - our old tree was just so ordinary, it came out of the loft every year and it was just boring.</p>
      <p>“Now, it looks different each year.”</p>

      <p>Tina said her children, Leah, 22, Dean, 21, and Jay, 11, look forward to seeing their mum’s festive creations every year but partner, Craig Wardley, 40, thinks she’s "crazy".</p>
      <p>Some more of Tina’s previous creations include a snowman tree and an Elf-themed tree, complete with a pair of Santa’s legs poking out of a chimney.</p>
      <p>Tina gets most of her decorations from eBay and the garden centre and has been using the same £40 Christmas tree as a base for her quirky designs since 2015.</p>

      <p>Tina said: “Jay loves it. He gets excited to see what I'm going to make and he helps me.</p>
      <p>"I start planning about one month before, I'll draw a picture and then start collecting the decorations.</p>
      <p>"It gets me in the Christmas spirit. I love that Christmassy feeling, it's brilliant.</p>
      <p>"One year, we made our own minion baubles with yellow paint and stuck some googly eyes on them.</p>
      <p>"It's a nice thing for us to do together as well.</p>
      <p>“But Craig does wonder where on earth I get all these crazy ideas from."</p>
