After its widely well-received debut, it appears the powers-that-be are looking to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a>'s showrunner, Jon Favreau, for direction on where the franchise may go next.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-uncertainty-extends-kathleen-kennedys-disney-future-1256357">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy is eying Favreau for an increased presence in determining what's next for the Star Wars franchise following <i>The Rise of Skywalker</i>'s release.</p>

      <p>THR is quoted as saying, "...with or without Kennedy, sources say it seems likely that Favreau will have a lot of say over the future of Star Wars. These sources also say Kennedy's ideal team includes key roles for Michelle Rejwan, a producer on <i>Episode IX</i> and Lucasfilm's senior vp live action development and production, and Dave Filoni, the veteran animation director and George Lucas protege who directed live action for the first time with two episodes of <i>Mandalorian</i>."</p>
      <p>The piece also focused on the potential for Kennedy to move on from Lucasfilm following next month's finale for the Skywalker saga, while also laying the groundwork for her legacy at the studio: "Even if remaining at Lucasfilm is not in the cards for Kennedy, this plan would enable her to trumpet that she has done the job she was hired to do — completing the Skywalker saga — and left the franchise in good hands."</p>
