        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/qantas">Qantas</a> said it would provide support to one of its flight attendants should she choose to take legal action against <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/william">Will.i.am</a> after the rapper publicly <a href="https://www.insider.com/william-racist-flight-attendant-laptop-qantas-airlines-2019-11">accused her of racial discrimination</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195530357400977408?s=20">posted a photo of her on Twitter.</a></li>
        <li>“Absent a retraction, and if the crew member wanted to take the matter further, we’d certainly be willing to provide legal support for them to do this,” a spokesperson for the airline told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/will-i-am-qantas-racism-row-intl-scli/index.html">CNN.</a></li>
        <li>The rapper <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195513495409704961?s=20">told his 12.8 million Twitter followers</a> that he and his friends were singled out by the <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195513495409704961?s=20">“#RacistFlightattendant”</a> during a trip from Brisbane to Sydney.</li>
        <li>“I’m sorry to say me and my group have experienced the worse service due to an overly aggressive flight attendant. I don’t want to believe she racist but she clearly aimed all her frustrations at the people of color only,” <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195507635803439104?s=20">he wrote.</a></li>
        <li>He claims the incident took place after he failed to hear a routine PA announcement, which advised passengers to store electronics.</li>
        <li>Representatives for Qantas and Will.i.am did not immediately respond to Insider’s requests for comment.</li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/qantas">Qantas</a> says it will support once of its flight attendants should she choose to take legal action against <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/william">Will.i.am</a> after the rapper <a href="https://www.insider.com/william-racist-flight-attendant-laptop-qantas-airlines-2019-11">publicly accused her of racial discrimination</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195530357400977408?s=20">posted a photo of her on Twitter.</a></p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Australian airline <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/will-i-am-qantas-racism-row-intl-scli/index.html">told CNN:</a> “Absent a retraction, and if the crew member wanted to take the matter further, we’d certainly be willing to provide legal support for them to do this.”</p>
      <p>In Will.i.am’s first tweet, he wrote that he was mistreated by a “<a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195513495409704961?s=20">#RacistFlightAttendant</a>” who was “overly aggressive” to “people of color.”</p>

      <p>The rapper, who is currently on tour with <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/black-eyed-peas">The Black Eyed Peas</a>, said he didn’t put away his laptop after a routine PA announcement which advised passengers to store their electronics.</p>
      <p>Will.i.am claimed he didn’t hear the announcement as he was wearing noise-canceling earphones.</p>

      <p>In a tweet that named the flight attendant, the rapper <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195561930112389120?s=20">said he was then met by five police officers</a> at Sydney airport, adding: “thank god the other passengers testified that SHE was out of control, the police finally let me go.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/will-i-am-qantas-racism-row-intl-scli/index.html">According to CNN</a>, Qantas initially said the matter was a misunderstanding, and that they “completely reject the suggestion this has anything to do with race.”</p>
      <p>However, the airline’s position changed after the rapper <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195530357400977408?s=20">posted a photo of the flight attendant.</a></p>
      <p>Some witnesses who claimed to be on board defended the rapper, that they <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195540381024190465?s=20">“couldn’t believe the appalling behavior of the flight attendant,”</a> and that they also were victims of racial profiling.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>However, other followers criticized Will.i.am for <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195530357400977408?s=20">identifying and sharing a photo of the Qantas staff member</a> to his 12.8 million Twitter followers.</p>

      <p>The rapper responded by telling his followers to <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill/status/1195591286440333312?s=20">“not send Hate” or “name calling”</a> to the flight attendant.</p>
      <p>However, in an <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/will-i-am-describes-alleged-racism-treatment-on-qantas-flight/video/a97a9518e177962bcd4a555ca11f519b">interview with Australia’s Daily Telegraph</a>, he stood by his position of using social media as a space to vent his frustration.</p>
      <p>“My taking to Twitter was just thinking of all the other folks that aren’t me and all the abuse that people have to take or being felt like cattle or sheep, being talked down by authority,” he said.</p>

      <p>While he said he doesn’t want the crew member to lose her job, he advised she should be “retrained on how to deal with people.”</p>
      <p>“I wish no harm to that lady, you know, hopefully, this is just a lesson and she doesn’t lose her job over it but if anything she should just be retrained how to deal with people, this is an opportunity for her to be pleasant to everyone,” Will.i.am. told <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/will-i-am-describes-alleged-racism-treatment-on-qantas-flight/video/a97a9518e177962bcd4a555ca11f519b">The Daily Telegraph.</a></p>
