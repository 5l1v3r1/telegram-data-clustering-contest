      <p>Jenna Dewan has been spotted absolutely glowing as she cradled her baby bump on a shoot.</p>
      <p>Who gave her permission to make maternity fashion this cool?</p>
      <p>The star, who’s expecting a baby with her boyfriend Steve Kazee, looked amazing in a flowy, floral dress as she wandered along Santa Monica pier.</p>
      <p>With her makeup and hair looking absolutely flawless, she’s putting us all to shame.</p>

      <p>She’s still making sure to spend quality time with her daughter Everly, who she shares with ex Channing Tatum, recently sharing a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/jenna-dewans-daughter-everly-kisses-baby-bump-twin-matching-jumpsuits-11123457/">snap of the six-year-old kissing her baby bump.</a></p>
      <p>So sweet!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Steve has made it clear that he’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/07/jenna-dewans-boyfriend-steve-kazee-thinks-pregnancy-mind-blowing-10873085/">still trying to get his head round the whole pregnancy thing.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking<a href="https://www.etonline.com/steve-kazee-says-his-and-jenna-dewans-pregnancy-journey-has-been-the-most-amazing-exclusive-133837"> to Entertainment Tonight</a>, Steve said: ‘It’s mind-blowing, the whole thing. Watching a child grow inside of a human has been the most amazing experience so far.’</p>

      <p>‘I’m trying to stay calm,’ he joked. ‘Not panic and let it all happen.’</p>
      <p>Steve revealed that he is planning on taking the next year off, so he can be there for Jenna and their newborn when they finally arrive.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t want to miss any of the baby growing. I don’t want to miss any of the morning sickness. I want to be there for all of it,’ he insisted.</p>
      <p>Jenna and Channing were married for nine years, with Everly being born in 2013.</p>

      <p>However, last year the pair split, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/jenna-dewan-dresses-growing-baby-bump-purple-reveals-reason-channing-tatum-divorce-10969480/">Jenna later revealing the reasons it wasn’t working out.</a></p>
      <p>‘I’d come to realise the dynamic I was in wasn’t serving me nor was it serving my daughter,’ she wrote in her new wellness book. ‘First and foremost I had to accept the realization this isn’t working and had moved into hurting.</p>
      <p>‘The public saw Channing and I in this idealised romanticised light. This made things difficult for me because I like being as honest and real as I can.’</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, with her relationship with Steve going strong and glowing throughout her pregnancy, things couldn’t seem much better for Jen right now.</p>
