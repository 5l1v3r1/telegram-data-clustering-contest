      <p>Google is making it easier for you to listen to the news with Assistant.</p>
      <p>In a recent <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/news/your-news-update/">blog post</a>, the search giant said it plans to introduce ‘Your News Update,’ “a smarter way to listen to the news hosted by the Google Assistant.”</p>
      <p>You can now say things like, “Hey Google, play me the news.” This can be done on any Assistant-enabled phone or smart speaker, Google said.</p>
      <p>It added that the update will include a mix of short news stories “chosen in that moment based on your interests, location, user history and preferences, as well as the top news stories out there.”</p>
      <p>If you keep listening to the news then it will extend “into longer-form content that dives deeper on your interests.”</p>
      <p>Google will also indicate which publications are being read and what is coming up next.</p>
      <p>The tech giant said that over two years of collaborating with publishers from around the world has helped grow this experience and make it better for users.</p>
