      <p>A fresh insight into Nottingham Forest’s stadium plans has got <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Joe Worrall</a> dreaming of wearing the Garibaldi in front of a packed City Ground in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Reds last week <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3540790">released new images</a> of their planned stadium redevelopment, with a planning application expected to be submitted before the end of the year and work due to get underway in 2020.</p>
      <p>And as well as the excitement off the pitch, there is plenty to be optimistic about on the field as Sabri Lamouchi’s men look to mount a promotion push this season.</p>
      <p>Boyhood Reds fan Worrall says <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3552378">the City Ground project</a> - with phase one rebuilding the Peter Taylor Stand to cater for 10,000 fans - is the perfect incentive as the team aim to maintain their top six spot.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to curse anything, but I’ve never felt like this,” said the defender.</p>
      <p>“I know I’ve only been playing at the club professionally for three or four years, but let’s not forget <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/sport-opinion/new-contracts-nottingham-forest-board-3557315">how many managers</a> I’ve seen come through the door and how many players!</p>
      <p>“It’s been a whirlwind of an upbringing to life in football for me. I’ve loved every single minute of it.</p>
      <p>“And with the new stand being built, it’s another step in the ladder; another piece of the jigsaw to my upbringing in football.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that I’m desperately excited to play in front of.</p>

      <p>“It’s just incredible that I’m growing up in Nottingham, playing for Forest and being able to play in front of a brand spanking new stand. It will be brilliant.”</p>
      <p>Worrall added: “With the facilities we’re getting, we need to mirror that on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it should be the other way around. I think it should be, ‘right, here’s your stadium, here’s your stand, here’s your facilities, now go and perform’.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it should be a reward thing. It’s more of an incentive thing.</p>
      <p>“With the backing of the people behind the scenes, it’s fantastic and something that all the players are very excited to be involved in.</p>
      <p>“We’re excited to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-very-aware-challenges-3556518">see the City Ground evolve</a> and play in. It will be incredible.”</p>
      <p>Worrall has been a key player for Lamouchi this season, following his loan spell at Rangers last term.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-make-transfer-decision-3132425">subject of some transfer speculation</a> in the summer, with the Reds understood to have turned down more than one bid.</p>
      <p>Hull City and Wigan Athletic were both believed to have shown an interest, though it is unclear whether either club were involved in making an offer.</p>
      <p>Worrall, however, has made clear his love for Forest as they prepare to return to action after the international break with a trip to Bristol City on Saturday.</p>

      <p>“Of course there’s always speculation. You see it all the time on Twitter,” said the Nigel Doughty Academy product.</p>
      <p>“But at the end of the day I’m playing for Forest - the team I love. I love wearing the red shirt.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that I’m focused on for the next game.</p>
      <p>“You never know what happens in football. Lots of things can happen, but I’m just focused on Bristol City.</p>
      <p>“After that, we’ve got <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-championship-promotion-prospects-3556986">a massive run</a> of games. Leagues are won and lost over the Christmas period, when it’s cold and some teams chuck it in.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of players who crumble under the old adage of Tuesday night at Stoke. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-stoke-3370516">We’ve done that one!</a> But it’s a long Christmas, people want to be at home in front of the fires.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying it’s all ‘boo hoo’ because we get paid to do it, but you’ve still got to have some steel as a football club.</p>
      <p>“You look at the successful teams and they’ve got good players, but they’ve also got honest players who work hard for each other.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ve got that in abundance.</p>
      <p>“We just need to keep performing and keep picking up points, then we can play some of that stuff in front of a new stand.”</p>
