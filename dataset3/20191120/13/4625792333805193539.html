      <p>Former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh has been indicted on a number of federal charges, including fraud, conspiracy, and tax evasion.</p>
      <p>Pugh, a 69-year-old Democrat, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/baltimore-mayor-quits-over-childrens-books-corruption-scandal">resigned earlier this year</a> after an alleged scheme involving sales of her self-published children’s book series, <i>Healthy Holly</i>, came to light. In a grand jury indictment unsealed Wednesday, prosecutors say that Pugh defrauded Baltimore businesses and nonprofits with about $800,000 in sales of her books, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-pugh-20191120-kzmc2v7cafetjladglhgnyusdy-story.html">according</a> to the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>.</p>
      <p>In April, FBI and IRS officials raided Baltimore City Hall and her house as part of their criminal investigation. She was reportedly paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for copies of the books from the University of Maryland Medical Center in a no-bid deal, all while serving on UMMC’s board. She <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/baltimore-mayor-takes-indefinite-leave-of-absence-for-health-amid-book-scandal">resigned from the board</a> after the news came to light.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors also said she evaded taxes. In 2016, while she was running for mayor, she told the IRS she brought in just $31,000 when her income was actually closer to $322,000.</p>
      <p>Pugh is slated to appear in court Thursday. If convicted, the 11 charges against her carry maximum sentences of a combined 175 years in prison. The federal government is also looking to seize her home and $769,688 in profits.</p>
