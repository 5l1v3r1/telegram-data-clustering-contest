      <h1>Maverick Sabre, O2 Institute, Birmingham - review</h1>
      <h2>It was only thanks to a tip off from a mate that I ever got into Maverick Sabre – but thank God I did.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:23:14+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/james-driver-fisher/" target="_blank">James Driver-Fisher</a></address>
      <p>After mentioning he was playing in Birmingham earlier this year I thought I listen to some of his songs.</p>
      <p>I was hooked pretty much straight away and then he brought out his 2019 album, When I Wake Up, which was arguably even better than the others.</p>
      <p>And when you combine his beautiful, soulful voice with a live band, some backing singers and the occasional acoustic guitar, it makes for a brilliant night.</p>
      <p>The 02 Institute in Birmingham was packed last night, waiting for the main act to appear. It's fair to say most were in high spirits too.</p>
      <p>Opening with Preach, it was an ideal way to introduce himself to his fans. It's a seriously-beautiful song, full of passion and feeling.</p>
      <p>The tempo was then lifted with I Can Never Be, which is a bit more upbeat but still has that lovely, bluesy-funky beat to it.</p>

      <p>Sabre's unique voice reaches a crescendo quite early in the song and then the chorus moves it on even further, especially when the backing singers get involved.</p>
      <p>Weakness is another superb ballad, especially when he sings, "in the corner, I'm in deeper each time, you kept me holding all your secrets in life. And you don't wanna take me as I am, 'cause I'm not who you want". Very poignant.</p>
      <p>Let Me Go again helped liven things up a bit, particularly as it's one of his better-known songs, before he hit us Slow Down.</p>
      <p>That is simply a gorgeous song it's impossible not to click your fingers to.</p>
      <p>After the slow build, it just explodes. With backing vocals and lyrics from our very own Jorja Smith, from Walsall, on the new album version, it adds even more feeling to an extremely soulful song.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, one of his earlier songs, shows off his versatility.</p>
      <p>His singing is great and his rapping and lyrics are arguably as good. If you're a fan of both, like me, it ticks all the boxes.</p>
      <p>"Growin' up was once an outsider never settled quick. Settling was hard when you're treated like a lump of sh*t." Again, it's a song that contains real meaning.</p>
      <p>He then treated us to We Don't Know – adding a bit of guitar into the proceedings really made the gig take off.</p>
      <p>It's electric guitar on the album but last night he treated us to a slower, acoustic version.</p>
      <p>Again, it's another track just full of funk and soul. It just makes you smile, dance and jump around.</p>
      <p>"Too bluesy, black choosy, a drive-by means slow cruisin'." Not all rap lyrics have to be about death.</p>
      <p>Sabre ended the show with his absolute classic, I Need. We do all need a little sunshine in our lives, and why not sing something that makes us reflect and long for something better, rather than dwelling on how rubbish this planet of ours can be at times.</p>
      <p>Too deep. Let's leave it there. And that's exactly what Maverick Sabre did last night.</p>
      <p>No encore, no time for shouting 'we want more'. As soon as the last note was sung, he was gone into the night.</p>
      <p>A fitting way to end a brilliant gig. He has a new fan right here – and once again I have to thank my mate for pointing him out and not letting this one pass me by like so many others.</p>
      <p>His new album is out now. If you fancy something bit different, from an artist with a unique voice, who clearly thinks about his lyrics and what he is singing about, I'd highly recommend giving it a whirl.</p>
