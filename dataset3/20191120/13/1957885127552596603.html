      <h1>Get a Nintendo Switch with Pokémon Sword or Shield free in the pre-Black Friday sales</h1>
      <h2>A Gigantamax-sized offer!</h2>

      <p>While we're still waiting for other retailers to put their offers live, Currys PC World still has the best early Nintendo Switch Black Friday bundle with Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield for £279.</p>
      <p>It's one of the key deals in their 'Black Friday Now' sale, which guarantees the price you pay today will not be beaten on Black Friday proper. If it does get lower, though, they'll refund you the difference.</p>

      <p>Considering that a Nintendo Switch would usually set you back £279 on its own, you're essentially getting Game Freak's latest Pokémon entry for free. It's the kind of Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal we'd expect to see once the sales event has kicked off next week. But, hey, we'll take it at this early stage too - especially when other retailers are only offering a console and the game for £299!</p>

      <p>Bundles featuring the Nintendo Switch Lite in its various colours and either Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield are also available at various retailers. However, these will set you back £219. That puts the price of the monster-gathering RPG down to just £20, but it's not quite as appealing as free, is it? Nevertheless, you may be after the handheld-focused version of the Nintendo Switch instead.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B081NSCRGS?tag=eurgam-m-bf-21">Nintendo Switch Lite with Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield for £219.99</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Honestly, I really don't expect this to be beaten on Black Friday. We've already seen that the US is getting a Nintendo Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe bundle for $299 as their main Nintendo Switch Black Friday deal. That's the old version of the console, too, with the shorter battery life. Seems like a poorly-disguised attempt at stock clearance more than anything.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-05-amazon-drops-some-early-nintendo-switch-black-friday-bundles">Amazon launched a range of new Nintendo Switch bundles from £299.99</a>. Perhaps we could see some of these discounted to match the latest Currys PC World offer, but that's something we can only wait and see for now! Definitely snap this up, then, if a Nintendo Switch with Pokémon Sword or Shield is the gift you're after this Christmas. More recently, ShopTo has put up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-20-nintendo-labo-kit-on-switch-drops-to-gbp30-ahead-of-black-friday">Nintendo Labo Kits for just £30</a>.</p>
