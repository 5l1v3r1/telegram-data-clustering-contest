      <h1>Bangladesh pacers excited at the sight of pink cherry</h1>

      <p>For Bangladesh, which traditionally fields a spinner-dominated attack, the enthusiasm of its faster bowlers at the prospect of extracting massive movement with the pink cherry has come as a pleasant surprise ahead of the second Test against India, starting at the Eden Gardens here on Friday.</p>
      <p>The only pink ball match was held in Bangladesh in 2013 and, according to team sources, no one from the present side featured in it.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the visiting pacers — Abu Jayed, Ebadat Hossain, Al Amin Hossain and Mustafizur Rehman — relished the sight of the rosy ball and a pitch with a tinge of green at the first nets session of the team at the Eden Gardens on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>“The four fast bowlers are excited. Bangladesh fast bowlers don’t get to be excited too often. They are coming to grips with the ball. The SG pink ball is slightly different. Most guys’ limited experience has been around the Kookaburra one. For us as a team, real joy to be here,” said Bangladesh spin bowling consultant Daniel Vettori, ahead of the first-ever pink ball Test in India.</p>
      <p>“The seamers did a great a job in the last Test, so they will come to the fore. The re-laid wicket here has more bounce. It was watered today and is now covered. The seamers, because of the pink ball and under lights, will play a big part in this Test match.”</p>
      <p>Vettori, New Zealand’s most successful spinner, said even though Indians were too good against the spinners, the spin bowlers would have a role to play due to the 1 p.m. start.</p>
      <p>“The spinners haven’t come into play that much if I recall correctly (from seeing previous pink ball Tests). It has been the seamers. But the spin bowlers play a big part in the game. The first two sessions, spinners could really be important.”</p>
      <p>Vettori said the twilight time would be the most crucial phase during the match.</p>
      <p>“The challenge will be how much of the Test match is under lights. The sun sets quite early here. That will be the time we will see the pink ball come into play. My experiences are only from watching on TV. The twilight hours, dusk, seems to do a little bit more. That’s going to be the exciting period of the Test match. That will be the period where tactically teams might try out a few different things.”</p>
      <p>The former New Zealand skipper said Tests under lights could bring back the spectators.</p>
      <p>“It could almost have a T20 or a one-day atmosphere. Kohli, Rohit walking out to bat will feel like a T20. If those guys get going, there will be an atmosphere that probably no player has played in Test match conditions.”</p>
