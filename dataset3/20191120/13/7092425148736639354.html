      <p>Skoda have completed their trio of SUV/cross-overs with the baby of the family, Kamiq, rolling into town yesterday to join the Kodiaq and Karoq.</p>
      <p>The crossovers are Skoda’s take on VW’s Tiguan, T-Roc and T-Cross while Seat have a similar setup with their Tarraco, Ateca and Arona.</p>
      <p>It means the VW group have a crossover/SUV for practically every price point.</p>
      <p>All is catered for, from under €20,000 for an Arona to €40k for a Tiguan Allspace and on up to the lofty €90k Audi Q8 — and God forbid the €300k Bentley Bentayega monstrosity.</p>

      <p>It’s canny marketing but it means we have lots of very similar cars on the road.</p>
      <p>Skoda know they have a challenge making theirs stand out.</p>
      <p>The Kamiq attempts to achieve that with its usual Skoda flourishes (ice scraper in fuel cap etc) as well as its oddly appealing headlights set-up.</p>
      <p>The daytime running lights are actually set above the aggressively styled main lamps, giving the car a unique face that hearkens back to the more Cyrano de Bergerac leanings of the popular Kodiaq.</p>
      <p>I think it looks smart, with its lettering detail having a more substantial look than most of these small crossovers pull off.</p>

      <p>It’s exactly the same width as the much-missed Yeti, the former Skoda stalwart with a more fanatical following than Cher.</p>
      <p>However it has some pretty generous space for this class.</p>
      <p>The boot has a capacity of 363 litres, which can be increased to 1,360 litres by folding down the back seat (60:40).</p>
      <p>It’s also got a smart, functional interior with a good level of in-car tech that only increases as you go up the trim levels.</p>
      <p>You can opt for Active (from €21,300 for manual 1.0 TSi petrol 94hp) through to the fancier Ambition and Style grades.</p>

      <p>Active and Ambition models feature a 6.5-inch Swing touch screen infotainment system, LED headlights and tail lights.</p>
      <p>Lane Assist, Front Assist with City Emergency Brake and Predictive Pedestrian Protection, and Multi-Collision Braking are also standard.</p>
      <p>Style versions receive the 8.0-inch Bolero infotainment unit and full LED headlights with AFS and dynamic indicators.</p>
      <p>As usual there are three TSI petrol engines with cylinder capacities of 1 or 1.5 litres and a 1.6 litre TDI producing 70 and 110 kW.</p>
      <p>Engines can be coupled with a 5 or 6-speed manual gearbox or a 7-speed DSG. Skoda say they are expecting demand to outstrip supply — so get moving if interested.</p>
