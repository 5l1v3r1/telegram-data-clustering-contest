      <p>When Karen Simmons, 62, developed epilepsy and had to retire from her job in the ambulance service, her 11 <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> helped her keep going.</p>
      <p>But she noticed that one of her pooches, Cupcake, was particularly good in stressful situations.</p>
      <p>She decided that Cupcake would make a great therapy dog and now the poodle visits care homes and hospitals to make patients feel better.</p>
      <p>Seven-year-old Cupcake has been a therapy dog for four years now and her striking appearance never fails to make people smile.</p>
      <p>Cupcake visits the Lister hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, where she puts a smile on both staff and patients’ faces.</p>
      <p>Karen, from Cheshunt, Hertfordshire said: ‘As we walk through the hospital corridors, there is a sea of smiles and it makes me happy knowing we are cheering other people up.</p>

      <p>‘She loves meeting new people, but she is so well trained and would never jump up or bark, she knows exactly how to behave in the hospitals.</p>
      <p>‘She goes from patient to patient and puts her head on their laps and it puts a huge smile on their face.’</p>
      <p>Karen developed the long-term condition epilepsy in 2012 and had to give up her job but Cupcake and the others helped her.</p>
      <p>When she started to improve, she wanted to do something to carry on helping people.</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘I was determined to keep on doing my bit to help other people and considering I love dogs so much it only seemed right to appoint the calmest poodle for the job.</p>
      <p>‘She has always had something special about her and a natural ability to remain calm in stressful situations.’</p>
      <p>Cupcake is registered with Therapy Dogs Nationwide – a charity which assesses dogs and owners for voluntary roles in hospitals, elderly homes and schools.</p>
      <p>They have a team of 12 therapy dogs to mentally stimulate, entertain and distract the patients.</p>

      <p>All dogs have been vaccinated and patients must use anti-bacterial gel before and after stroking to avoid passing germs between patients.</p>
      <p>Karen said: ‘We previously used to visit in nursing homes, so Cupcake is excellent with the elderly – many of which have dogs of their own at home.</p>
      <p>‘A visit from Cupcake helps them when they are missing their pet and allows them to forget they are in hospital for a while.</p>

      <p>‘It is fantastic to see patients’ faces light up as she walks in the room and they are always impressed with her coat.’</p>
      <p>‘It can be hot in the hospital, so I have to keep on top of her grooming, but I recently started experimenting with colours which the patients adore.’</p>
      <p>Jane Shaw, who is the Patient Experience Project Coordinator, at the Lister Hospital, said: ‘Hospital days can be long and a bit boring for patients, but a visit from Cupcake and the other dogs is a real highlight.</p>
      <p>‘Patients’ faces light up when they see Cupcake and her visits give them a touch of normality and helps alleviate stress and anxiety.</p>
      <p>‘Sometimes staff tell us that the first time they have seen a smile from a patient is when Cupcake walks on to the ward.</p>
      <p>‘It isn’t just the patients, but the staff too who are thrilled to see Cupcake.</p>
      <p>‘They have very busy and intense jobs and seeing Cupcake gives them a moment to regroup and re-energise before they return to a busy day.</p>
      <p>‘Cupcake and the other dogs brighten up everyone’s day and we are so grateful for their visits.’</p>
