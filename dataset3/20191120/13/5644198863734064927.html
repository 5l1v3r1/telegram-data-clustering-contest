      <p>SYDNEY: Pakistan's 16-year-old seamer Naseem Shah will make his debut against Australia in Brisbane, the touring side's captain Azhar Ali said on Wednesday on the eve of the first test.</p>
      <p>The schoolboy cricketer from Lower Dir district on the Afghanistan border would eclipse former home captain Ian Craig as the youngest test debutant on Australian soil.</p>

      <p>Craig took the field as a 17-year-old against South Africa in 1953, scoring a half-century at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
      <p>"We are definitely looking to play him," Ali told reporters in Brisbane. "He's bowling really well. We'll announce the side tomorrow (Thursday) but he's definitely going to be part of it."</p>
      <p>Naseem has only seven first class matches under his belt but could hardly ask for a better pitch for his first test outing, with the Gabba usually serving up a fast and bouncy wicket.</p>
