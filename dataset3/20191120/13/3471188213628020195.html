      <h1>Made for Creators: ACER ConceptD Desktops, Notebooks and Monitors Available in Australia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Neerav Bhatt</a></address>
      <p>Ausdroid readers are familiar with Acer’s range of Chromebooks but perhaps not as much with their Windows powered computer range.</p>
      <p>Acer just announced that Australian creators including graphic designers, engineers, filmmakers, architects, developers and beyond will be able to purchase ConceptD desktops, notebooks, and monitors within weeks.</p>

      <p>The ConceptD range comprises of high-performance devices that are optimised for the creative industries, giving users the colour accuracy, high performance, memory space and refresh rates they need to embrace the creative process and build remarkable things.</p>
      <p>They are also equipped with efficient thermal solutions to minimise noise, and have a design aesthetic that isn’t “boring” like a standard workstation.</p>
      <p>As an example the flagship ConceptD 500 workstation has optimal thermal, ventilation, airflow dynamics and is cooled using three cooling fans to draw the air in through the triangular front air panel and circulating it throughout the chassis. And yet, at just 40dB it is still quiet enough to be unobtrusive.</p>
      <blockquote>“Bringing ConceptD to Australia is an exciting milestone for Acer … we saw a clear opportunity to expand our offering with a range tailor-made for creators and their unique needs,” said Darren Simmons, Managing Director, Oceania, Acer.</blockquote>

      <p>As ConceptD devices are equipped with high-performance processors and graphics that can handle extreme workloads, they are designed to enable creators to bring their ideas to life more effectively and further drive these outcomes.</p>
      <p>Professional design work requires professional tools, and the ConceptD laptops and monitors feature a pixel-packed 4K UHD display backed up by several colour technologies.</p>
      <p>They also feature integrated colour correction and have demonstrated superior fidelity in reproducing the PANTONE Matching System (PMS) Colours.</p>
      <p>With a 100% Adobe RGB colour gamut, colours will be brighter and more accurate due to extending the colour range of cyan-green hues.</p>
      <p>The Adobe RGB gamut covers a wider range of colours than an sRGB gamut. The ConceptD range of products has been tested and calibrated to achieve a low Delta E average of &lt;1 to &lt;2 to reproduce true-to-life colour accuracy</p>
      <p>Equipped with NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics cards, the ConceptD devices are bringing real-time ray tracing and AI to the applications creators use for designing digital assets.</p>
      <p>Breakthrough GPU technologies combined with the new NVIDIA RTX architecture allow creators to work at the speed of their imagination—creating and refining realistic and immersive experiences much faster than with CPUs.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/AU/content/conceptd-home">ConceptD range (ConceptD 7 and 9 notebooks, Concept CP3 and CP7 monitors and the ConceptD 500 desktop will be fully available in Australia</a> in early 2020.</p>
