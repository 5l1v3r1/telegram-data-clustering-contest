      <h1>Roku Streaming Devices Discounted for Black Friday Sale</h1>

      <p>Black Friday sales abound and this particular deal sees all three of Roku's steaming players get their prices slashed.</p>
      <p>The Roku Express, Roku Premiere, and Roku Streaming Stick+ are all getting some pretty decent discounts from now until Tuesday, December 3, with up to £20 off. You can also indulge in <a href="https://www.roku.com/en-gb/offers/rakutentv">three free HD movies from Rakuten TV</a> when you buy a new Roku player or Roku TV.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2016/10/roku-express-review-a-streaming-stick-that-plays-everything/">Roku Express</a> first launched in 2016 with a refreshed model released this year, that got a smaller, sleeker form factor. Both iterations are included in the sale, alongside the Premiere and Streaming Stick+, but the older variant can only be found at its reduced price in-store at <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/search/roku/">Argos </a>and <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/298592579">Tesco</a>. The rest of the discounts can be found at any of Roku's UK retail partners.</p>

        <li><b>Roku Express (2019):</b> was £29.99 now £24.99 from all UK retail partners.</li>

      </ul>
      <p>Amazon will most certainly be unveiling discounts for its own streaming devices, and while we've had word on the sale details for the US site, information on what's in store for this side of the pond is less forthcoming. Lucky for us, our editor Tom did the hard work and <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/amazon-black-friday-echo-fire-tv-discount-uk/">figured out what those US sale prices will likely translate to in real money</a>, so until Amazon chimes in with official word, that's as good as you're going to get.</p>
