      <h1>Get $10 for free by making three or more transactions through Samsung Pay Cash</h1>

      <p>Samsung launched <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/samsung-pay-cash/">Samsung Pay Cash</a> and <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-pay-money-transfer-service-us/">Samsung Pay Money Transfer a couple of months back</a> to bolster its mobile payment service Samsung Pay. The former is a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-pay-cash-announced-meet-samsung-virtual-prepaid-card">virtual prepaid card powered by Mastercard</a> that allows Galaxy customers to store cash in their <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/samsung-pay/">Samsung Pay</a> account to make online and offline purchases. Samsung Pay Money Transfer, meanwhile, as the name implies, enables users to seamlessly send money to people in numerous countries across the globe.</p>
      <p>For the holiday season, Samsung has come up with a few offers to incentivize its US customers to use these new features. Firstly, customers who do three or more transactions in December through Samsung Pay Cash will receive $10 in their Samsung Pay Cash account. Since Samsung Pay Cash can be used pretty much wherever Samsung Pay and Mastercard works, it shouldn’t be difficult to complete at least three transactions next month. The Korean company also used to give $5 for signing up for Samsung Pay Cash, but we are not sure if that offer still exists or that it can be combined with this new offer.</p>
      <p>Second, for the entire month of December, Samsung is waiving off the service fee when you use the Samsung Pay Money Transfer feature to send money to family and friends in various parts of the world. However, do note that while Samsung clearly states it will not charge any service fee for money transfers, it does say other fees may apply.</p>
      <p>Apart from these promotions, Samsung is also offering customers Rewards points for every ride they take through Lyft once they link their Lyft account with Samsung Rewards account. Finally, the Korean company will also offer Rewards points equivalent to the purchase price of any theme, wallpaper, icon, or always-on display design in the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/samsung-pay-cash/">Galaxy Store</a> for the rest of November through December 12. The deal also applies to in-app purchases up to $1,000 per user per day in select games such as Pokémon GO, Asphalt 9: Legends, Harry Potter, and more in the Galaxy Store.</p>
