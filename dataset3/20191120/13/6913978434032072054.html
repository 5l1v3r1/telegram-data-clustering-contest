      <p><b>JOHANNESBURG —</b> Ethiopia came from behind to shock the Ivory Coast 2-1 and Madagascar crushed Niger 6-2 in fierce heat as 2021 Africa Cup of Nations matchday two qualifying concluded Tuesday.<br/><br/>Hundreds in a huge crowd at the 60,000-seat Bahir Dar stadium ran on to the field at full-time to salute an Ethiopian side composed of 10 home-based footballers plus one who plays in Egypt.<br/><br/>Ivory Coast, twice African champions and 95 places higher than Ethiopia in the world rankings, made a great start with Tottenham Hotspur defender Serge Aurier scoring on four minutes.<br/><br/>But the Group K match turned dramatically midway through the opening half with Surafel Dagnachew and Shimelis Bekele scoring in a 10-minute purple patch.<br/><br/>The Ivorians introduced French Ligue 1 midfielder Victorien Angban in the second half as they sought an equaliser, but Ethiopia held firm to collect maximum points.<br/><br/>While the 1,800-meter (5,905 feet) altitude was a disadvantage for a visiting side, the unusually cool weather in the northern city would have suited them.<br/><br/>In the same group, Madagascar shook off difficult preparations to crush Niger in 39 degrees Celsius (103 Fahrenheit) heat.<br/><br/>The national stadium in Niamey has a bone-hard pitch, but that was no obstacle to the Indian Ocean islanders as they recovered from conceding an early goal to lead 6-1 after 65 minutes.<br/><br/>Amadou Wonkoye gave Niger a lead that lasted just four minutes before Lalaina Nomenjanahary levelled and the France-based Malagasy scored again to trigger the romp.<br/><br/>Madagascar were the surprise side of the 2019 Cup of Nations in Egypt, stunning Nigeria and eliminating the Democratic Republic of Congo before bowing to Tunisia in the quarter-finals.<br/><br/>After beating Ethiopia in Antananarivo last Saturday, Madagascar coach Nicolas Dupuis, his staff, the players and officials had to travel to Niger in two groups.<br/><br/>Like most African national teams, Madagascar cannot afford to charter a jet, and many airlines are unable to accommodate a full delegation in one flight.<br/><br/>Limited training time add to the challenges facing Dupuis, who was recently rewarded with a four-year contract extension after the unexpectedly successful campaign in Egypt.<br/><br/>Niger have suffered worse home humiliations, in the same stadium in Niamey 50 years ago they lost 9-1 to Ghana, the record away victory in a Cup of Nations qualifier.<br/><br/>Madagascar top the table with six points, Ethiopia and the Ivory Coast have three each and Niger are pointless.<br/><br/>Morocco and Mauritania share the lead in Group E as they followed up their 0-0 draw in Rabat last Friday with matchday two victories.<br/><br/>Achraf Hakimi, on loan to Borussia Dortmund from Real Madrid and a full-back with a fondness for goals, completed the scoring as Morocco outplayed Burundi 3-0 in Bujumbura.<br/><br/>Mauritania left it late to seal a 2-0 win over the Central African Republic in Nouakchott with Diallo Guidileye doubling the lead one minute into stoppage time.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, Zimbabwe star Khama Billiat answered critics of his recent international form by scoring both goals in a 2-1 Group H win over neighbours Zambia in Lusaka.<br/><br/>Group J pacesetters Tunisia edged Equatorial Guinea 1-0 in Malabo with former Premier League forward Wahbi Khazri scoring the lone goal 16 minutes from time.<br/><br/>Libya rose from last to second in the same section by shading Tanzania 2-1 with giant Anis Saltou snatching the 81st-minute winner in a match moved to Tunisia for security reasons. — AFP</p>
