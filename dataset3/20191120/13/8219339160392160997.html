      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/trevorjd14/" target="_blank">Trevor Daugherty</a></address>
      <p>Each year Black Friday delivers some of the best iPad deals, and 2019 is shaping up to be no exception. All of Apple’s latest tablets will be included in this year’s best Black Friday iPad deals, with notable price drops mainly coming on the 2019 10.2-inch iPad. <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/walmart-black-friday-ad-2019/">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/07/best-buy-black-friday-ad-preview/">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/01/amazon-countdown-black-friday-2019/">Amazon</a>, and <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/06/target-black-friday-ad-2019-ipad-pixel-deals/">Target</a> will all be offering sale prices during Thanksgiving week with deals on Apple’s iPad Pro, mini, and more. All of the best iPad Black Friday deals can be found just below.</p>
      <h3>Best iPad deals that are live right now</h3>
      <p>At this time, the best iPad Black Friday deals center around iPad Pro, which is <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/walmart-amazon-ipad-pro-deals/">currently marked down to <b>$674</b></a> at Amazon on the entry-level model. You can <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/20/walmart-amazon-ipad-pro-deals/">save <b>upwards of $200</b></a> off the regular going rate on the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro as well, with notable discounts on the high-end configurations. Apple’s latest iPad Pro sports a new Liquid Retina edge-to-edge display with ProMotion, True Tone, and wide color. Other features include Face ID, 12MP camera, four speakers, and up to 10 hours of battery life, all of which are powered by Apple’s new A12X Bionic chip.</p>
      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/338kHOO">Apple’s 10.2-inch iPad is currently <b>$30 off</b></a>, although we know far better deals are on the horizon for Black Friday. This is a match of the standard discount since it was <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/10/ipad-10-2-inch-screen-announced/">announced</a> earlier this year. For more details on what to expect on the 10.2-inch model, check out our <a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/black-friday-2019/">earlier Black Friday ad leaks</a>.</p>
      <p>We’ll constantly be<a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/ipad/"> updating our iPad guide</a> with the latest deals in the lead up to Black Friday and beyond for additional markdowns on every model.</p>

      <h3>Best iPad Black Friday deals to come</h3>
      <p>While current offerings may be somewhat slim, there are plenty of iPad Black Friday deals on the horizon. Headlining is the 2019 10.2-inch iPad, which is set to fall to a new all-time low price of <b>$249</b> at <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/walmart-black-friday-ad-2019/">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/06/target-black-friday-ad-2019-ipad-pixel-deals/">Target</a>. This is likely going to be the hottest iPad deal throughout the holiday shopping season and one that we whole-heartedly expect <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/best-black-friday-deals-amazon/">Amazon</a> to match.</p>
      <p>iPad Pro is expected to be discounted by as much as <b>$400 off</b> at <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/07/best-buy-black-friday-ad-preview/">Best Buy</a> with <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/best-black-friday-deals-amazon/">Amazon</a> bringing similar pricing when all is said and done. We also know that previous generation 10.5-inch models will be on sale too, with the 512GB version <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/14/walmart-black-friday-ad-2019/">listed at <b>$599</b> via Walmart</a>.</p>
      <p>iPad mini 5 has mostly been left out of early Black Friday leaks and has mostly gone without a discounted in 2019 from authorized retailers. Rakuten is likely to fill the void when it rolls out a <b>15% off</b> sitewide discount next week. Otherwise, you’re not expected to see a straight cash price drop on Apple’s smallest iPad throughout Black Friday.</p>
      <p>We can expect even more previous-generation iPad deals throughout Black Friday. The latest 9.7-inch iPad is a likely candidate for a healthy price drop during Thanksgiving week, maybe also hitting <b>$200</b> for the first time. Only time will tell, but we’ll be working around the clock <a href="https://9to5toys.com/guides/ipad/">updating our iPad</a> guide and this post, with the latest deals.</p>
