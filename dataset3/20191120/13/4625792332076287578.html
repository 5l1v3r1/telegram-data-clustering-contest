      <h1>'No one will know': Hollywood executive recommended Julia Roberts play Harriet Tubman</h1>

      <p>Screenwriter Gregory Allen Howard said a studio executive originally recommended a white woman play Harriet Tubman in a biopic about her life.</p>
      <p>"This is a great script. Let’s get Julia Roberts to play Harriet Tubman," Howard <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-19/gregory-allen-howard-hollywood-harriet-tubman-oscars">recounted</a> Tuesday in the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>after telling the tale in an <a href="https://www.focusfeatures.com/article/interview_screenwriter_gregory-allen-howard">interview</a> earlier this month. According to him, the comment had come from a studio sublabel head in 1994 when the movie <i>Harriet</i> was first being pitched.</p>
      <p>Howard said as the only black person in the studio, he pointed out that Tubman was a black woman and that "Roberts couldn’t be Harriet," to which the president said, "That was so long ago. No one will know that."</p>
      <p>Tubman was eventually played by British actress Cynthia Erivo in the film, which premiered this month.</p>
      <p>"What I realize now is that the film was not going to get made until the <i>environment</i> in Hollywood changed — Hollywood had to go through its own climate change," Howard said.</p>
      <p>"Nobody in Hollywood wants to be an outlier. Hollywood has a herd mentality. There was no herd around the story of a former slave girl who freed other slaves. All the people I pitched this to, submitted the script to, were asking themselves one question: 'How do I sell this story to my boss, to a studio, to my financial partners?' <i>Fear</i> chilled them," he added.</p>
      <p>Tubman was a key figure in antebellum America, escaping from slavery and helping free hundreds of other slaves through the Underground Railroad. She is <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/mnuchin-harriet-tubman-wont-be-on-20-bill-for-another-decade">slated to have her likeness</a> put on the U.S. $20 bill in 2028.</p>
