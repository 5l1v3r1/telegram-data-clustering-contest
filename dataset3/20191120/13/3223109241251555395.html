      <p>One of my favorite memories of growing up is eating milk-soaked Teddy Grahams as talk radio played from my grandparents’ kitchen.</p>
      <p>And while no one has an unironic receiver anymore, you can still listen to the sweet sounds of <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/study-americans-dont-trust-social-media-to-deliver-news-1806117/">AM news broadcasts</a> via smart speakers.</p>
      <p>“At Google, we saw an opportunity to help move digital audio forward by focusing on audio news,” product manager Liz Gannes wrote in <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/news/your-news-update">a blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>Enter Your News Update, a “smarter” way to listen to daily bulletins hosted by the <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/google-wants-to-teach-kids-about-phishing-fake-news-1793294/">Google Assistant</a>.</p>
      <p>Simply say, “Hey Google, play me the news” on any Assistant-enabled phone or speaker to hear a mix of short reports—chosen in that moment based on your interests, location, user history, and preferences—and top stories.</p>

      <p>If you’re a Mets fan who follows the stock market and lives in Chicago (basically, my uncle), you might hear a story about the latest “L” construction, an analysis of last week’s baseball game, and a market update. As well as the latest national headlines.</p>
      <p>“Keep listening and the experience will extend into longer-form content that dives deeper on your interests,” according to Gannes.</p>
      <p>“In between stories,” she explained, “the Google Assistant serves as your smart news host that introduces which publishers and updates are next.”</p>

      <p>The tech titan has spent two years building a library of global news sources, including ABC, CBS, <i>USA Today</i>, Fox News, <i>The Washington Post</i>, Reuters, Aljazeera, CNN, Associated Press, NBA, WNYC, <i>Billboard</i>, <i>Economist</i>, and more.</p>
      <p>“The high-quality stories our partners provide are critical to creating a comprehensive yet intimate news experience for listeners,” Gannes said.</p>
      <p>Your News Update is now available in English in the U.S., and will expand internationally next year. To find the feature, visit Assistant settings &gt; You &gt; News &gt; News playlist format.</p>
