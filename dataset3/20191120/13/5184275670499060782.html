      <p>Talking about her skin routine, “I make sure that every morning, my skin is really well moisturised; I use my sunscreen, I make sure I wash my face at least once during the day. I try not to overdo it, just so if there’s any dust on my face, it doesn’t settle into my pores. And of course, I make sure that I take off my makeup at night before I sleep. It seems like a very big task, but I try and do it as much as possible. I also make sure that I use my night serum and moisturise my lips before I go to bed.”</p>
