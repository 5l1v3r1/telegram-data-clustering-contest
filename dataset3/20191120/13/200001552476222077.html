      <h1>From Denmark: Commentator believes Eriksen is leaving Tottenham – ‘Full stop’ on situation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:55:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>With Ekstra Bladet today reporting Jose Mourinho’s appointment at Tottenham is ‘terrible’ for Christian Eriksen, another Danish newspaper is also getting in on the act.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bt.dk/fodbold/ekspert-mourinho-vil-marginalisere-eriksen-yderligere">BT</a> has spoken to Morten Bruun, he’s a former Denmark international and currently a well known commentator in the country.</p>
      <p>Just like those at Ekstra Bladet, Bruun believes the arrival of Mourinho makes Eriksen’s exit likelier, and that it could even happen in the January window.</p>
      <p>With a contract expiring next summer, the winter market is the last opportunity for Spurs to receive a transfer fee. Mourinho will likely want money to spend, and selling Eriksen is one way to bring some funds in.</p>
      <p>Bruun is quoted as saying: <i>“I think that Jose Mourinho’s arrival in Tottenham means that Christian Eriksen will be further marginalised and that it will bring a January shift closer, because it will be in everyone’s interest.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“I think Eriksen has decided to leave Tottenham. Full stop. And I think that Mourinho will be presented with the scenario that there is no chance of Christian Eriksen continuing.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Given the former Manchester United manager has signed a contract with Spurs until 2023, it would suggest he’s presented a long term plan to those in charge at the club, so there would be little point relying on a player who has his mind set on leaving.</p>
      <p>It’s clear the slant in Denmark is Eriksen’s exit is now likelier, but it’s possible Mourinho could convince him to extend, especially given that there isn’t a long queue of clubs clamouring for his signing.</p>
