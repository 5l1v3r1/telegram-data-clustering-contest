        <b>Former Coronation Street and Loose Women star Shobna Gulati has shared a heartbreaking social media post on Instagram following the tragic death of her mother. Revealing that she is ‘heartbroken’ following the loss a few weeks ago, Shobna admitted that she is not sure how to live without her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The actress, best known for playing Sunita Alahan in the soap, said in a moving post accompanied with a picture of her mum: ‘Our beautiful mum passed away , a few weeks ago, peacefully in her sleep . Still processing, these days are hard . She was our lynchpin connecting us as a family .</p>
      <p>‘Our lives are changed and life is very different now . She did her very best and in the last 25 years I grew to know her as a person and the amazing woman that was our mum and for that circumstance and time I am truly grateful . She taught me such a lot … but not how to live without her . Completely heartbroken.’</p>

      <p>She recently wrote in a blog for <a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/blog">Alzheimer’s Research UK Dementia Blog</a>: ‘Vascular dementia has definitely made Mum more socially isolated, and more and more of today’s older generation is facing this future. It’s also isolating for carers, like me and my siblings.</p>

      <p>‘In our community it’s normal for everyone to know everyone else’s business, it’s a very social affair. But when you’re struggling to cover cracks in normal life, it can also create a real social pressure.</p>
      <p>‘Talking about dementia, and the value of research, is vital. It’s such an important way to break down these stigmas.’</p>
