      <h1>Would you rent a vacuum cleaner for $499 a month?</h1>

        <b>Vacuum cleaning is a chore many people are happy to outsource, but one company is trying to persuade firms to swap an automated service for human cleaners.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Softbank, the Japanese firm behind WeWork and Uber, has launched a self-powered machine, dubbed The Whiz, at a hefty price tag of $499 (£381) a month.</p>
      <p>Softbank says its robot is meant to replace "over-worked janitorial teams."</p>
      <p>The Whiz is not initially automatic, as a human has to lead it around until it can learn the cleaning route.</p>
      <p>It has been developed by Softbank's US robotics arm and Hong Kong-based firm Intelligent Cleaning Equipment.</p>
      <p>The three-feet-tall (0.9 metres) vacuum was initially only offered for rent in Japan and Hong Kong.</p>
      <h3>'Cleaning efficiency'</h3>
      <p>The machine sends an alert if there is an issue, such as bumping into a wall. After three hours, it can cover 15,000 square feet (1,394 square metres) but then will need a battery change.</p>

      <p>It also gathers data and produces a report with analytics on dirt levels.</p>
      <p>Softbank says in its presentation materials this provides the ability to "actively demonstrate cleaning efficiency to stakeholders".</p>
      <p>One UK firm told the BBC they were planning to conduct trials with the robot in hotels around Southampton.</p>
      <p>Ellen Gasson, marketing director for Hampshire-based Industrial Cleaning Equipment (a different business from the Hong Kong company), says when they trial the machine in hotels, a cleaner will need to be present to allow the robot into rooms to clean floors.</p>
      <h3>WeWork rescue</h3>
      <p>The vacuum cleaner launch comes after tech investor Softbank announced its worst ever financial results, earlier in November.</p>
      <p>Softbank reported a £5bn operating loss for the second quarter of 2019, after companies it invested in, Uber and WeWork, suffered poor financial performances.</p>

      <p>WeWork, a flexible office space company had to be<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50138354"> given a multi-billion dollar rescue package</a>. Its chief executive Adam Neumann, departed and was replaced with Softbank executives.</p>
      <p>Despite the negative recent press, some analysts remain positive on Softbank and see the company's stock as undervalued.</p>
      <p>"The WeWork debacle has eroded investor confidence but we retain our strong conviction regarding the long-term outlook for the company," said Chris Lane, an analyst at Bernstein in a research note.</p>
