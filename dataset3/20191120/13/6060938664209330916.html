      <h1>ACC Emerging Cup: India lose to Pakistan by three runs in semis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:04:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>DHAKA: India crashed out of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Asian-Cricket-Council">Asian Cricket Council</a> Emerging Teams Cup after losing by three runs to arch-rivals Pakistan in the first semi-final on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Pakistan dished out a strong top-order display to put up 267 for seven on the board after opting to bat. Openers Omair Yousuf (66 off 97 balls) and Haider Ali (43 off 60) put on a 90-run opening stand to lay a solid foundation.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, Said Badar (47 not out off 48), skipper Rohail Nazir (35) and Imran Rafiq (28) made useful contributions with the bat to take Pakistan to a defendable score.</p>
      <p>Pacer Shivam Mavi (2/53), off-spinner Hrithik Shokeen (2/59) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saurabh-Dubey">Saurabh Dubey</a> (2/60) shared six wickets between them.</p>
      <p>Chasing, skipper Belur Ravi Sharath (47 off 43 balls) and Aryan Juyal (17 off 17) made a bright start, stitching 43 runs off just 38 balls for the opening wicket.</p>
      <p>After the dismissal of Juyal, Sharath held fort in the company of top-scorer Sanvir Singh (76 off 90) with a fifty-plus stand, but India's chase hit a roadblock once the duo got out.</p>
      <p>India were dealt a severe blow when <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Armaan-Jaffer">Armaan Jaffer</a> (46 off 53) and Yash Rathod (13) were dismissed in quick succession, reducing the team to 211 for five in 38.1 overs.</p>
      <p>With five wickets in hand, the target was still achievable, but India kept losing wickets and were stopped at 264 for eight.</p>
      <p>With Chinmay Sutar (28 not out) at the crease, India needed an achievable seven runs off the last over, but they made a mockery of the chase as right-arm pacer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Amad-Butt">Amad Butt</a> conceded just four runs and also picked up the wicket of Mavi to seal the win for Pakistan.</p>
