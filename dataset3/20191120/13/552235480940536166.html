        <b>Almost 3000 parking tickets were issued by Stirling Council in just three months, it has been revealed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Between July 1 and September 30 this year, 2980 <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/top-parking-ticket-hotspots-stirling-11696584">tickets</a> were handed out by Stirling Council enforcement officers - 274 of which were cancelled on appeal.</p>
      <p>However, at a meeting of the council’s environment and housing committee last Thursday, some members questioned why parking tickets had risen while fines for other issues had seen a drop.</p>
      <p>SNP councillor Alasdair Macpherson described the number as “astonishing”, asking what it equated to in financial terms.</p>
      <p>While officials gave no specific figure they said the fines ranged from £30-£60 depending on when they were paid. That would mean the council raked in anything from £81,180 if everyone paid their ticket at the lower fine, to £162,360 if they all paid at the higher rate.</p>
      <p>Tory councillor Alistair Berrill highlighted that enforcement action for other issues saw only six penalties issued for fly tipping, nine for littering, 23 for abandoned vehicles, six for dog control and none at all for dog fouling.</p>
      <p>He added: “Parking is the one category that is shown to have significantly increased, up 52 per cent. I’m concerned that we are showing the wrong priorities when it comes to enforcement.”</p>
      <p>Asked about whether methods to pay for parking other than coins were available, safer communities officials said alternative methods for parking meters across the area were being looked at and they were hoping to have a potential solution.</p>
      <p>Tory councillor Martin Earl said: “I’m getting a bit frustrated. We really have to be installing this now. It’s got to the stage where a lot of tickets are being issued because drivers don’t carry change.”</p>
      <p>Committee chair SNP councillor Jim Thomson, however said: “I really can’t agree with that. There’s no evidence to back that up. It [cashless] has been introduced at Wellgreen multi-story car park I believe, so the process has started.</p>
      <p>“People know full well if they pay their parking fee they won’t get a ticket.”</p>
      <p>Senior infrastructure manager Brian Roberts said: “We still need cash in the system. Some authorities have made the mistake of putting in a purely cashless payment system, but some systems charge us up to 20 per cent of the payments and some charge an excess so the customer is paying more.</p>
      <p>“Online payment is not a free system and we also need a system that suits our consumer.”</p>
      <p>Labour’s Danny Gibson said: “For those trying to explain it away - if you follow the rules of the road and park where you are supposed to park - we guarantee you won’t get a ticket.”</p>
