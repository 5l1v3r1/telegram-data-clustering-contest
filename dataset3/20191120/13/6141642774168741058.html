      <p>The Duke of York contradicted a senior aide’s account of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein in his TV interview with Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>Andrew told BBC Newsnight he first met the since-disgraced financier through “his girlfriend back in 1999”.</p>
      <p>But in March 2011, the duke’s then-private secretary Alastair Watson, who spent nine years in the role, wrote to The Times newspaper saying Andrew met Epstein in the “early 1990s”.</p>

      <p>“The duke has known Mr Epstein since being introduced to him in the early 1990s.</p>
      <p>“The insinuations and innuendos that have been made in relation to the duke are without foundation.”</p>
      <p>Convicted sex offender Epstein took his own life while imprisoned earlier this year.</p>
