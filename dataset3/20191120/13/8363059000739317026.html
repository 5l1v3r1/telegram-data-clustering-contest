      <h1>Aston Martin Prepares James Bond's Wife's Car for Manufacture in Wales</h1>

      <p>That headline's not far from the truth for once, as Aston Martin's new DBX SUV was designed by the company with one particular ideal customer in mind -- a mother and business owner in her 40s, called Charlotte. "Ah, Mrs Bond," says the boss of the exclusive Kensington nursery on one morning in early September. "We've been expecting you. You can't park that there."</p>
      <p>The DBX SUV is the first product of Aston Martin's investment in an all-new production facility in St Athan, South Wales. It'll be built there and bear the legend "Made in Wales" on its door plaque, and once the factory is fully up to speed around 750 workers will be employed churning out the posh, £158k model, for the benefit of mostly minted overseas buyers after an Aston the shopping and dog can get in.</p>
      <p>And perhaps more will come from Wales too, as the company's first SUV is designed to allow the DBX platform to be used in future electric models of Aston. This one, though, is powered by a V8 engine from Daimler, so Charlotte will still have to risk getting petrol on her pink tracksuit.
