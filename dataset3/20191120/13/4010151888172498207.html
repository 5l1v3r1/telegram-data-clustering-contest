      <p>Juul, the top-selling maker of e-cigarettes in the United States, is being sued by California for allegedly targeting <a href="https://teens.webmd.com/default.htm">teens</a> with it early marketing campaigns.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit, filed Monday, also alleges that Juul's website didn't previously adequately verify customers' ages, the <i>Associated Press</i> reported.</p>
      <p>This is just one of many legal battles for Juul. It's the focus of numerous state and federal investigations into whether its early marketing campaigns helped trigger the teen <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung-cancer/vaping-lung-cancer">vaping</a> crisis in the United States.</p>
