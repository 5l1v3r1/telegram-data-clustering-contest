      <h1>Struggling and exiled from their home ground - but Newmains United bosses hope to rebuild the club</h1>
      <h2>Co-managers Paul Davies and Craig Gupwell have big plans to take the club away from the foot of West Region League Two.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p>They face a battle at the foot of the bottom tier, they can’t play games at home, and are one of the most notorious stugglers in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/brother-helped-save-wishaw-juniors-20381496">junior ranks</a> – but things are looking up at Newmains.</p>
      <p>Having hovered around the lowest point <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/brother-helped-save-wishaw-juniors-20381496">in the West Region</a> for over a decade the trend has continued for co-managers Paul Davies and Craig Gupwell with just three wins all season.</p>
      <p>Alongside that the minnows have only been able to play one league game at their home ground Victoria Park all term after asbestos forced the closure, meaning they miss out on vital revenue.</p>
      <p>With Newmains losing out on derbies against Carluke, Lanark and Lesmahagow - their three biggest crowds - and games to be called off over the winter period finances are tight.</p>
      <p>However, the dugout duo believe the club are on the cusp of something big.</p>
      <p>Davies notes “there isn’t a cashflow problem” thanks to sponsors and North Lanarkshire Council allowing them to use Bothwellhaugh in Strathclyde Park for games.</p>

      <p>He reckons they have made <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/newmains-juniors-carluke-fc-hope-12097412">huge strides since the club merged with Carluke United in 2018.</a></p>
      <p>“There are three or four of us who run the team from top to bottom,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“The guy who we took over from handed us the keys. It was a case of what do we do, do we shut the gates? But we made a go of it.</p>
      <p>“We built a cracking little committee with people that we knew.</p>
      <p>“When we arrived here we had one match ball that was three years old.</p>
      <p>“There was equipment lying around, players didn’t have a tracksuit, there was holes in the floor and the place was a state.</p>
      <p>“Hindsight; would we have went it’s not worth it? Maybe. But we’d be lost without it now. It’s a journey from below the ground.</p>
      <p>“Collectively there are so many positives.”</p>
      <p>So far this campaign, Davies admits it has been “a massive disadvantage” to miss out on clashes in ML2.</p>

      <p>Gupwell says confidence from heavy defeats, with 44 goals conceded so far this campaign, has been a major issue: “You want to make the home ground a fortress</p>
      <p>“There is a difference in mindset when we play away or at another ground. That’s why we need a wee run of home games.”</p>
      <p>Newmains are the only team in the division who don’t pay players or offer expenses, and the management team admit “attracting players is not the easiest.”</p>
      <p>However, Davies says that they have taken the decision that “if someone was chasing £20 a week we would rather put that into our facility.”</p>
      <p>“We spent £1000 on the pitch a few weeks ago, and now cut and control the pitch,” he went on.</p>
      <p>“There is a great set-up behind the scenes, when it comes to the volunteers and the media academy we are up there with the likes of Pollok.</p>
      <p>“It then falls to us to get results. We have a five year plan, and we are ahead of that plan already.</p>
      <p>“We have youth teams as well, with parents and kids who now want to come and watch the junior team.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Every pound of profit we bring in we are looking to re-invest that into the club.</p>
      <p>“It’s not like at Queen’s Park. They have an attraction of playing at Hampden. They are a cash-rich club and get team buses; it’s a whole package.</p>
      <p>“It’s a model we would like to replicate. We want to give players the best facilities we can.”</p>

      <p>Gupwell believes that they can offer a platform to players that many players wouldn’t expect – with some stars given their chance to break into the SPFL: “We sold two players last season, and through one of our players got a trial with Dumbarton last season.</p>
      <p>“I’m not sure how many people realise that when we’re playing at the lowest level of junior football.</p>
      <p>“If he was a bit fitter he would have signed for Dumbarton.</p>
      <p>“Boys are getting a chance, they get game time, and can get a chance in the senior leagues.”</p>
      <p>For the rest of the season, Davies reckons the division is split into mini-leagues “and in the division at the bottom we want to finish top of that” to reach a club record finish.</p>
      <p>Gupwell adds that they want to bring in a higher quality of players, stating “the hardest thing is getting rid of the perception of what Newmains used to be.”</p>

      <p>“People used to look and see this was a team that never got any points. They would go and get gubbed every game.</p>
      <p>“It was heavy defeats and they were the whipping boys from junior football.</p>
      <p>“Only once in the last 11 years have they finished outside of the bottom two of the bottom tier.</p>
      <p>“That’s a perception we need to get rid of.</p>
      <p>“We want to beat our points total of last season (17 points). Our first target is fifth bottom. If we get to 20 points before the turn of the year it gives us a stepping stone.”</p>
