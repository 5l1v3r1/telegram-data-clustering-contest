      </p>
      <p>Belgium midfielder Kevin De Bruyne labelled Euro 2020 a “fake competition” and claimed the draw format is a sign of football becoming more of a business than a sport.</p>
      <p>Roberto Martinez’s side won all 10 qualifiers to finish top of Group I and qualify automatically for next year’s finals, which will be staged in 12 different cities across Europe.</p>
      <p>The group draw will take place on November 30 but, due to seedings and rules involving host nations, Belgium already know they will be drawn into Group B with Russia and Denmark.</p>
      <p>Belgium can start planning for the expansive tournament, but Manchester City star De Bruyne is unhappy with the format.</p>

      <p>“It’s a shame,” he told VTM Nieuws after scoring twice in Tuesday’s 6-1 win over Cyprus.</p>
      <p>“For me, this feels like a fake competition. Football has become more and more [like] a business.”</p>
      <p>De Bruyne featured in six of Belgium’s qualifiers, scoring four times and assisting a further six goals.</p>
