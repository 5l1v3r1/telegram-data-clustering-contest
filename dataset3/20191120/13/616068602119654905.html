      <p>Drivers might want to approach these intersections with a little more caution.</p>
      <p>A report provided to Vernon civic leaders earlier this month identified the most dangerous intersections in the city.</p>
      <p>At the top of the list is 48th Avenue and 27th Street according to a report from consulting group McElhaney Consulting Services.</p>
      <p>McElhaney Consulting compiled the report based on five years of ICBC collision claims data from 2013 to 2017 and 48th Avenue and 27th Street by far had the most accidents with more than double that of the second most dangerous intersection.</p>
      <p>According to the report, there were 161 accidents at the intersection, with one third involving injuries.</p>
      <p>And of those accidents, 30 were rear-end collisions with weather being a factor in half of them.</p>
      <p>According to the report, access to the gas station at the intersection created turning challenges for motorists on top of other, nearby accesses.</p>
      <p>The report recommended a right turn signal heading southbound, putting in median islands and a right turn island, anti skid treatment fo the pavement and a review of signal timing and coordinate signals in the area.</p>
      <p>The second most hazardous intersection on the list is Anderson Way-58th Avenue-27th Street at the north end of town.</p>
      <p>Over the five-year span there were 79 accidents, half of which resulted in injuries.</p>
      <p>Third on the list is 48th Avenue and Anderson Way, where there were 66 accidents, with just under half resulting in injuries.</p>
      <p>The intersection of 43rd Avenue and 20th Street was fourth on the list with 43rd Avenue and 29th Street rounding out the top five.</p>
      <p>A full list of intersection and recommendations to make them safer can be found on the <a href="https://www.vernon.ca/sites/default/files/docs/meetings/agendas/191112_regular_agenda_pkg.pdf">city website</a>.</p>
