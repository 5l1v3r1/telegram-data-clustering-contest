      <h2>Police excesses on Shafi Parambil, MLA, and KSU activists</h2>

      <p>The Opposition on Wednesday forced an adjournment of the Assembly demanding disciplinary action against those police officials who committed excesses and assaulted Shafi Parambil, MLA, and KSU activists for staging a protest here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>V.T. Balram, who gave notice for an adjournment motion on the police action against the students who took out an Assembly march to press for their demands, said that certain police officials having close links with the CPI(M) had resorted to lathi-charge on Mr. Shafi even after knowing fully well that he was an MLA.</p>
      <p>He alleged that the police took on the KSU workers who were protesting peacefully and said that medical care was denied to Mr. Shafi who suffered an injury on his head. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan were following the same police policy, he said and demanded action against such officials.</p>
      <p>Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan, who was deputising for Mr. Vijayan, said the government did not approve of the police assaulting MLAs and other public men and the Additional Chief Secretary, Home, would probe the incident. Action could be taken only on getting the inquiry report, he said and Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan denied notice for the motion.</p>
      <p>The Opposition then pressed its demand and moved to the well of the House. Subsequently, Roji M. John, Eldhose P. Kunnappilly, Anvar Sadath, and I.C. Balakrishnan climbed on to the dais, stood around Mr. Sreeramakrishnan shouting slogans. Mr. Sreeramakrishnan then left the chair and business was suspended for 50 minutes.</p>
      <p>On resuming business, Mr. Sreeramakrishnan described the developments as unfortunate, named the MLAs who entered the dais and said action on them would be decided in due course. The Opposition refused to budge from its demand and continued disrupting the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sreeramakrishnan then completed the dayâ€™s business in haste and adjourned the House.</p>
