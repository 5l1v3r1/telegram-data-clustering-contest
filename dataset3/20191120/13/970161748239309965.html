      <p>Police teased a wanted thief after he tried to evade capture by disguising himself with a pair of glasses.</p>
      <p>David Springthorpe, 30, was being hunted by officers for breaching a court order as well as number of shoplifting offences.</p>
      <p>But they didn’t have to look too far to find the crook after spotting him in the street – despite his attempts to ‘change his image’ with the specs.</p>
      <p>Social media users poked fun at the effort after officers from the South Normanton and Pinxton Safer Neighbourhood Team posted a pair of mugshots online – one with the glasses and one without.</p>
      <p>Many were quick to ridicule the attempt, with one pointing out how the disguise did nothing to conceal his ‘massive ears and neck tattoo’.</p>

      <p>Springthorpe was subsequently charged with the theft of several perfume gift sets from Boots and jailed for 30 weeks at the Chesterfield Justice Centre.</p>

      <p>The force, part of Derbyshire Police, wrote that Springthorpe was held ‘after a short foot chase’.</p>
      <p>They added that he had ‘recently changed his image by sporting a pair of glasses’, but ‘fortunately this was not quite cunning enough to outsmart the team’.</p>
      <p>Web users took to social media to mock Springthorpe’s attempt, with Tom Armstrong writing: ‘Pleased with the custodial sentence. Doubt it will make much difference though. Unfortunately it’s in one ear, out the other with people like him. ‘</p>
      <p>Angela May said: ‘On reflection, David realised the Mickey Mouse Ear muffs may have been less conspicuous than he first thought and was regretting his choice of the Michael Caine-style glasses.’</p>
      <p>Tim Bottomley added: ‘Yes mate, those glasses completely disguise the fact you’ve got massive ears and a neck tattoo. PMSL He looks exactly the same.’</p>
      <p>Springthorpe, from Alfreton, was previously in court back in January after stealing £20 worth of steak from a Co-Op store when he was fined £80 and ordered to pay £20 compensation and £85 costs.</p>
