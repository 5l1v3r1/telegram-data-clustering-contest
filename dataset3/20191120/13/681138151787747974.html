      <p>A combination of spiralling costs, lack of organisers and the loss of the premises used to house Santa's grotto left a question mark over this year's event - between December 6-8 - even taking place.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Lesley Thompson said: "At one point earlier this year it was looking touch and go, but it's now very much on.</p>
      <p>"It's a big part of the Lavenham year so we were very sad to think it might not happen.</p>
      <p>"It was very much on-off at the beginning of the year due to a lack of support and funds, but villagers and local businesses have rallied round with help and donations."</p>
      <p>Santa's grotto was previously housed in a building in the Market Place which has since been sold.</p>
      <p>It will now be in a marquee behind the Greyhound pub between Lady Street and the High Street.</p>
      <p>Ms Thompson said last year saw more than 7,000 visitors to the fair, which raised more than Â£1,500 for local charities.</p>
      <p>"It's not about making money, so long as we break even we are able to give the rest to charity," she said.</p>
      <p>"But the event has grown enormously in recent years, which is good news for the retailers here, and there is a lot of good shopping to be had at the fair."</p>
      <p>This year's event takes place between Friday December 6 and Sunday December 8 and will feature more than 50 stalls selling festive produce including locally produced food and wine, chocolate, cheese, cakes, and Christmas puddings.</p>
      <p>Visitors are encouraged to dress in Dickensian style, with a prize for Best Costume, and also a prize for the Best Dressed Dickensian shop window.</p>
      <p>The programme also includes a guided lantern tour of Lavenham on Saturday, with stories of traditions, legend and ghost tales, then ending up with mulled wine and mince pies at The Swan hotel.</p>
