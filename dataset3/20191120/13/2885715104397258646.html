      <p>To decongest traffic in Bengaluru by stopping long-distance buses at peripheral points, the Karnataka government has begun the process of setting up eight intermodal transit hubs to connect bus, metro or rail networks at the city’s entry points at different sides.</p>
      <p>The Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT) has invited bids from companies with expertise in providing quality-cum-cost-based solutions to set up the transit hubs in Bengaluru. The DULT has identified eight locations in the peripheral areas in North, South, East, and West directions to the Bengaluru city.</p>

      </p>
      <p>According to officials from DULT, intermodal transit hubs are going to come up in Challaghatta-Mysore Road (West direction), Baiyyappanahalli- Existing BMRCL terminal, KR Puram (East direction), Peenya- Existing BMTC Terminal (North-West Direction), Bommasandra in existing BMRCL land (South direction).</p>
      <p>The DULT is yet to identify the location for three more transit hubs in Old Madras road and Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) junction (East direction), Bellary Road and PRR junction (North direction), Kadugodi (East direction).</p>
      <p>Speaking to<i> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">Indianexpress.com</a>,</i> a senior official said, “In order to utilise the Bengaluru urban roads in an efficient way and also to help the people for the efficient intermodal transfer, the transit hub locations shall be located in the peripheral areas of the city. The intermodal transit hub locations shall also be well-integrated with the other public transport modes to ensure a smoother journey within the Bengaluru city limit.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>“We are building the transit hub locations in all the directions to the city so that the buses coming from all the directions need not enter within the city limits as well as it will help the maximum number of users to use public transport while entering Bengaluru,” he further said.</p>
      <p>According to the technical design accessed by<i> Indianexpress.com,</i> the facilities to be available at the transit hubs are broadly divided into two categories: passenger amenities and physical integration. The passenger amenities will include a waiting room, washroom, cloakroom facility, food stalls, small shops, and help desk.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The DULT has given priority to physical integration, like seamless transfer between different transit modes, integration with auto and taxi services and shared mobility services (bike rental, PBS etc.), parking facility for two-wheelers and four-wheelers in the transit hubs.</p>
      <p>In the 2019-20 budget, the state government had announced to build a multi-modal transport hub with an aim to provide seamless integration between metro, rail, and BMTC-Traffic and Transit Management Centre (TTMC) in Bengaluru.</p>
