      <p>A suspected drug dealer had a birthday to remember after police found a haul of drugs and cash stashed in his car.</p>
      <p>Neighbourhood officers were on patrol in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> 's West End on Friday night when they came across a vehicle being driven suspiciously on Richardson Road.</p>
      <p>They followed the vehicle and pulled it over on Barrack Road where they carried out a search at around 8pm.</p>
      <p>Officers uncovered a haul of nine bags of suspected MDMA as well as £400 in cash.</p>
      <p>The driver, who was celebrating his 23rd birthday, was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in offering to supply a Class A drug with intent to supply.</p>
      <p>Police later uncovered a further 20 bags of suspected cocaine and more than £1,500 in cash.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the suspected supply of Class A drugs is ongoing and the suspect has since been released under investigation.</p>
      <p>A senior police officer has praised the work of officers who took action when they saw something that didn’t look right.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumbria-police">Northumbria Police’s</a> detective chief inspector Paul Knox said: “This arrest and subsequent seizures is solely down to the vigilance of those officers on patrol.</p>
      <p>“They know when something doesn’t look quite right and they took quick action to seize evidence and place the suspect under arrest.</p>
      <p>“It will certainly be a birthday to remember after spending the night in our police cells at Forth Banks.</p>
      <p>“We will always take robust action against anyone we suspect of dealing Class A drugs on our street and a full investigation is now ongoing.</p>
      <p>“But the public also have a role to play and I would ask you to look out for suspicious behaviour. If something doesn’t look right then don’t take a chance, pick up the phone and contact police.” </p>
      <p>Anyone with information about drug dealing, or anyone who wants to report suspicious behaviour, is asked to call Northumbria Police on 101.</p>
