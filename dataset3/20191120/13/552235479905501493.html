      <h1>Alfredo Morelos' Rangers redemption and the Colombia dream fuelling remarkable turnaround</h1>
      <h2>The striker has come of age this season but what's inspired his outstanding form?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:16:49+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos' whereabouts 12 months from now is anyone's guess.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> striker's relentless goalscoring exploits come with an inevitable side effect, and one fans are beginning to accept renders his future as potentially lying away from Ibrox.</p>
      <p>A January departure has been firmly ruled out by the Ibrox club, making next summer the likely point at which player and adoring support may say their goodbyes.</p>
      <p>But whatever happens come the beginning of next season, Morelos will hope his journey includes one, particularly meaningful milestone.</p>
      <p>While we on these shores continually cast aspersions over the commitment, or alleged lack thereof, with certain players in the Scotland squad, the same accusation can't be levelled at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> and his beloved Colombia.</p>
      <p>On the rare occasion the 23-year-old drops some tidbits to the media, most often radio stations in his homeland, there's an immense pride at representing his country that even dodgy Google translations cannot dilute.</p>
      <p>It's why the emotional pull of next year's Copa America on home soil mustn't be understated in his ongoing Rangers redemption arc.</p>

      <p>South America's premier international competition will be co-hosted by Colombia and Argentina in June 2020, a year on from the bitter disappointment Morelos endured ahead of last summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>An ignominious end to the 2018/19 season where disciplinary issues, not goals, were the focal point ensured the Ibrox star failed to secure a place on boss Carlos Quieroz' provisional list, far less the final squad.</p>
      <p>But there are already signs things could well be different next time out.</p>
      <p>Twenty-two Rangers goals by November, a first international strike and a near-spotless rap sheet point to a player for whom, as <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> hoped, the penny has finally dropped.</p>
      <p>It's a turnaround for which Morelos deserves enormous credit, albeit his goalscoring prowess was never really in doubt.</p>
      <p>It also points to a player who gazed into his own future and saw opportunities which may have slipped away had things not changed.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/english-premier-league">Premier League</a> dream, the Copa America in Colombia, and the chance to become a genuine Ibrox hero.</p>

      <p>Morelos has been open about his desire to play in England's top flight, a stance which most fans will accept and perhaps even appreciate in its honesty, no matter how heartbreaking his eventual departure may be.</p>
      <p>The importance of international recognition, too, is clear. Remember how his hometown of Cerete came together in the street simply to witness his debut, a 13-minute cameo in a friendly against Venezuela?</p>
      <p>It's a love that's clearly mutual, with the player launching the 'Fundacion Alfredo Morelos' in September in the hope of unearthing the next "El Bufalo" and creating the same pathway to Europe down which he trod.</p>
      <p>And finally, perhaps, there's a want to repay the fans and manager who stuck by him during last season's five red card incidents, when some suggested he had become a lost cause who should be cut loose.</p>
      <p>Fast forward almost eight months from his final misdemeanour at Celtic, followed by the Colombia snub and the difference in outlook is stark.</p>
      <p>All that together, appears to be fuelling a prolific campaign which has Marco Negri wondering if his 33-goal midseason tally may just be under threat.</p>
      <p>And should the Italian's 22-year record fall, it's a win-win for everyone at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>Morelos' Colombian dream will edge closer to reality, quite possibly embellished by dragging Rangers to that long-awaited major trophy.</p>
