      <h1>Alfredo Morelos' Ecuador sitter proves Rangers star can't cut it at the top level - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Gavin Berry took your calls as Celtic fans scrutinised the striker for missing a guilt edge chance for Colombia.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:20:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland are just 180 minutes from wiping away 22 years of hurt after victory over Kazakhstan ended a miserable Euro 2020 qualifying campaign on a high to boost confidence ahead of next year’s play-off.</p>
      <p>The 3-1 success over the Michal Bilek’s side at Hampden made it three wins on the spin for the first time in two years with John McGinn’s double taking his tally to seven goals in his last six caps.</p>
      <p>It takes a lot to get Scotland boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> excited and the same goes for the Tartan Army after decades in the international doldrums.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> set to be paired with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria or Israel in Friday’s semi-final draw to see how meets Norway or Serbia in the final for a place at next summer’s tournament then there is at least some optimism.</p>

      <p>However, they say it’s the hope that kills you and the <i><b>Hotline</b> </i>- never glass half full at the best of times - are understandably wary of what lies ahead.</p>
      <p><b>Drew Ferguson</b> , Oban, said: “We need to be careful describing John McGinn as sensational against the might of Kazakhstan as any decent team will defeat this level of opposition.</p>
      <p>“Let’s see how we get on against Norway or Serbia before we think Scotland has turned a corner.”</p>
      <p><b>James Blair</b> , Fife, said: “After going a goal down we came back to beat a side who had won twice away from home in 10 years and we’re supposed to be celebrating that?</p>
      <p>“If we are lucky enough to get through the play-off semi-final then there is no chance we’ll beat Norway or Serbia in the final.”</p>
      <p><b>Mark Russell</b> , Gorebridge, said: “We have beaten San Marino, Cyprus and Kazakhstan and suddenly everyone thinks we are world beaters.</p>

      <p>“Scotland aren’t up to the challenge of getting through these play-offs. It will end in tears yet again and we’ll be outside looking in yet again next summer in a tournament we are helping to host.”</p>
      <p>The other international fixture that seemed to have caught the attention of Old Firm fans took place in Harrison, New Jersey, rather than Hampden.</p>
      <p>It involved <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> ’ Colombia who defeated Ecuador 1-0 in a friendly and his performances at international level always seem to be used to score points in tit for tat between <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> and Celtic fans.</p>
      <p>Morelos broke his international duck against Peru in the previous game but missed a good chance against Ecuador as he aims to end his derby drought this month.</p>
      <p><b>Mick Jamieson</b> , Perth, said: “Yet another sitter missed by Morelos for Colombia. He can’t cut it at the top level as continues to be shown at international level and the fact he can’t score against Celtic.”</p>

      <p><b>Gerard Kelly</b> emailed: “Celtic fans fear Alfredo Morelos? Don’t make me laugh. He has never shown up against Celtic and is worth around £8 million rather than the £20 million.”</p>
      <p><b>Rab McDonald</b> , Troon, said: “It doesn’t matter whether Alfredo Morelos is the top scorer in Scotland because it doesn’t guarantee you trophies.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure he’ll be in the running for individual accolades but at the end of the day his goals haven’t resulted in any silverware during his time at Ibrox.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Michael Edmonds</b> , Northampton, said: “The fee Rangers eventually get for Alfredo Morelos will depend on how much money they have in the bank at the time of sale and how much influence his agent has.</p>
      <p>“Celtic held out for the full asking price for Kieran Tierney because he was tied up on a long contract and have plenty money in the bank so they didn’t need to sell.”</p>
      <p><b>Robert McEwan</b> , Mount Vernon, said: “Alfredo Morelos is a good goal scorer but if he scores a hat-trick in the Betfred Cup final and Celtic win then I’m happy with that.”</p>
