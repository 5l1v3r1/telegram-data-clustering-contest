      <p>President Ram Nath Kovind has said battles of tomorrow will be fought in the domain of information and technology (IT) and the only way ahead is to strive for excellence in every field.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kovind was addressing a function at the Indian Naval Academy (INA) at Ezhimala here on Wednesday after presenting the President’s Colour to the INA for its yeoman service in training and shaping Indian Naval officers over the last 50 years.</p>
      <p>The President’s Colour was received by Academy Cadet Captain Sushil Singh on behalf of the INA in an impressive parade comprising 730 cadets and a 150-men Guard of Honour. Mr. Kovind said the navy was inducting a large number of highly capable and state-of- the-art assets and equipment.</p>
      <p>“We live in a digital age and the battles of tomorrow will be fought in the domain of the information and technology,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Kovind said India being a maritime nation, a significant proportion of our trade and energy needs were met through the medium of oceans, he said.</p>
      <p>“Safety of the seas and maritime commons, therefore, remains a critical requirement to ensure the economic and infrastructure development of the land, as also to ensure the well being of its people,” he said.</p>
      <p>The President said the country faced a number of security challenges, both in the conventional and asymmetric domains.</p>
      <p>However, the country looked upon the Indian Navy to deliver each and every time, whether it was a full-fledged conflict, natural calamity, law and order challenge or a diplomatic mission, he said</p>
      <p>Mr. Kovind said amid all these challenges, the only way ahead from here was to strive for excellence in every field and always remembering the Navy's core values of ‘duty and courage,’ which formed the fundamental values expected of all naval personnel.</p>
      <p>Earlier, appreciating the INA, he said the energetic and invigorating parade presented by the cadets spoke volumes of the high standards of training imparted at the institution.</p>
      <p>The President's Colour should serve as the motivating symbol to inspire and mould a generation of officers that would pass out from this world-class institution, he said.</p>
      <p>He exhorted the cadets to fully utilise the training at INA to be better leaders in the complex and uncertain world of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh, Minister for Ports Ramachandran Kadannappally<b>,</b> Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief Southern Naval Command Vice Admiral A.K. Chawla, and other senior service and civilian dignitaries were present on the occasion.</p>
      <p>A special postal cover was also released by the President to commemorate the occasion.</p>
