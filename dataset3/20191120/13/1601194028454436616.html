      <p>Wrestling is a business like no other, in sports like <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma">MMA</a> and Boxing the two rivals will be in the ring or the cage doing everything in their power to defeat their rival before they can defeat them. In wrestling, two wrestlers have to work together throughout the match in order to put on the best show.</p>
      <p>Storylines are definitely interesting since this is what fans become invested in, but more often than not these stars will work hard on the buildup and then become friends throughout the process of their rivalry.</p>
      <p>This has happened many times in the past since there have been several stars who were against each other on-screen but would then travel home together or even be pictured outside of the ring having a meal together.</p>
      <p>WWE is much more aware of kayfabe at present and will prevent stars who are working a feud together from traveling together, but there have been some fantastic examples of WWE's bitterest rivals actually being the best of friends.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/lacey-evans">Lacey Evans</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/natalya">Natalya</a> have collided a number of times over the past few months to the point where their rivalry could only be decided in a Last Woman Standing match. It was a match that was won by Natalya before it was then announced that the two women would make history in Saudi Arabia.</p>
      <p>Natalya and Evans traveled to the Middle East together and then had a fantastic match where Nattie once again came out on top before they then returned to their opposite brands.</p>
      <p>Evans and Natalya were able to put on some fantastic matches throughout their short feud, but it was evident in Saudi Arabia that the two women had become quite close and Evans had learned a lot from Nattle throughout their time performing together.</p>
