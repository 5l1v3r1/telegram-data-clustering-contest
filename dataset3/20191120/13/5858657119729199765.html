      <p>WASHINGTON — A whistle-blowing flight controller says changes in air traffic control procedures at a major centre in Florida raise the risk of a mid-air collision, but the Federal Aviation Administration disputes the claim.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel said Wednesday that it notified the White House and Congress of the controller’s allegations.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower’s complaint focuses on changes by managers at a centre near Jacksonville, Florida, that controls flights over parts of five states and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
      <p>The FAA says the procedures in use at the Florida facility are used elsewhere around the country and comply with its standards for altitude separation of planes.</p>
