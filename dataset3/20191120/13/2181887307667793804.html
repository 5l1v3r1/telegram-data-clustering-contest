      <p><b>SAY WHAT</b> you want about Huawei, they sure make a sexy laptop.</p>
      <p>The troubled Chinese tech company has received some serious plaudits over the last couple of years for its <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3011707/huawei-matebook-x-review">MateBook</a> range, and now, it looks like we're about to get a taste of the next chapter.</p>
      <p>A number of renders <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">posted by serial leaker Evan Blass</a> suggest that there are two new models in the pipeline. One is a pretty bog-standard 14in device. We suspect it's not a refreshed <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3034832/huawei-matebook-x-pro-review">MateBook X Pro</a>, simply because it has an HDMI port, something that has previously only been included on mid-range Huawei devices.</p>
      <p>The more interesting variant appears to be a 15-incher - the first time Huawei has dabbled into a larger form-factor. From the renders we can make one or two fairly safe assumptions - the power key looks to be the usual one that doubles as a fingerprint sensor.</p>
      <p>Ports abound, with three USB-A ports, a USB-C (probably Thunderbolt 3), and the aforementioned HDMI connector.</p>
      <p>Again, this configuration suggests a mid-range model; the top-line stuff is designed to be as thin as possible and that means sacrificing anything unnecessary, but we'll reserve judgement - this slightly larger machine could break those conventions.</p>
      <p>The screen offers up the usual impressively tiny bezels, but because of the dimensions of the display, that's only the case on three sides - the bottom has a big ol' black bar.</p>
      <p>For the past two years, Huawei has announced new Matebooks at MWC in Barcelona, which would put them on target for a late-February reveal and a late-April/early-May release.</p>
      <p>The only unknown at this stage will be the operating system. The last Chinese MateBook <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3081537/huawei-matebook-linux-china">ran Linux</a> and although <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3083979/huawei-90-day-extension-november">Huawei recently scored an extra 90 days grace from its crippling US trade ban</a>, it will struggle to be able to get a Windows PC licensed and ready to go in time, unless there's a breakthrough in the current impasse.
