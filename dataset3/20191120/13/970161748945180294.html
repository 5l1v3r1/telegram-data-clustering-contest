      <p>A Costa Coffee barista having a stroke desperately tried to get help from colleagues by scrawling ‘Can’t work – can’t control anything’ on a piece of paper.</p>
      <p>Barney Foster, 22, didn’t realise he was having a stroke but knew something was wrong and that he needed medical help.</p>
      <p>His co-workers at the coffee shop called his mum, who took him to the nearest A&amp;E in Burton Upon Trent.</p>
      <p>Staff didn’t pick up the stroke at first, and told him it would be his history of migraines causing him to feel unwell.</p>
      <p>He was discharged, but ended up back in hospital the same night.</p>
      <p>Barney, who was also a student at the time, said: ‘I went home that night and I had the worst headache I’d ever felt – I was in excruciating pain.</p>

      <p>‘I looked back at the note and thought that maybe the migraine diagnosis didn’t seem right after all as I’ve never had to do anything like that before.</p>
      <p>‘My dad then took me back to A&amp;E in the middle of the night and the following morning a stroke consultant came to see me after expressing concerns I was unable to detect any temperature on the right side of my body.</p>
      <p>‘The consultant then sent me for a brain scan which discovered a clot on my brain and confirmed I’d actually had a stroke.</p>
      <p>‘I was definitely the youngest person on the stroke ward for sure.’</p>

      <p>Barny, from Burton in Staffordshire, was only 19 at the time he suffered the ischaemic stroke – which occurs when the blood supply to your brain is cut off or severely reduced.</p>
      <p>This can happen when an artery or other blood vessel in the brain is blocked by a blood clot or clump of fat.</p>
      <p>After spending three weeks in hospital, Barney went on to recover and he is now a podiatrist.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘As soon as they found it was a stroke, they started me on Warfarin – a medication which stops your blood clotting as easily – which I’ll be taking daily for the rest of my life.</p>
      <p>‘I struggled with my memory too after my stroke – for example they asked me to name as many animals as I could and I could only name five.’</p>

      <p>Due to his memory difficulties, Barney had to postpone his first year university exams but was able to resit them a few months later.</p>

      <p>He still suffers from some effects of the stroke but counts himself lucky to be alive.</p>
      <p>‘I still notice the effects in day to day life, with not being able to feel temperature or pain in my right side (especially my arm and hand), but like I say, some people die of strokes, or are left with their lives completely changed as well as the lives of their families,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Barney is running the London Marathon in 2020 to raise money for the Stroke Association and is hoping to raise £2000.</p>
