      <p>Former Chelsea and Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has been appointed new Tottenham Hotspur manager until the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician takes over from <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277221-mauricio-pochettino-sacked-premier-league-side-tottenham-poor-run-form.html">Argentine handler Mauricio Pochettino, who was shown the exit doors</a> earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been without a job after being fired by the Red Devils almost a year ago after too many issues with players and the club chiefs.</p>

      <p>"<i>We are delighted to announce the appointment of Jose Mourinho as Head Coach on a contract that runs until the end of the 2022/23 season</i>," the statement from Spurs' official website read.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Mourinho was quoted to have told his close allies that he prefers to join Spurs instead of staging a return to Real Madrid.</p>

      <p>The two parties were said to have been in talks in the last few days but negotiations got intensified when it was sure Pochettino would be shown the exit doors.</p>

      <p>Speaking on the new appointment, Spurs chief Daniel Levy described the Portuguese as a “tactician” who had the potential to do great things with the London club.</p>
      <p>“<i>In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football. He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician</i>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"<i>He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room</i>.” Levy said as quoted by the Spurs website.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has won three Premier League titles during his reigns as Chelsea boss. He has also won two Champions League trophies with Porto and Inter Milan among several other titles.</p>

      <p>Mourinho’s first assignment will be an away trip to a struggling West Ham United in a Premier League London derby.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that Premier League giants <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277221-mauricio-pochettino-sacked-premier-league-side-tottenham-poor-run-form.html">Tottenham have fired their manager Mauricio Pochettino</a> after a poor run of form with Spurs sitting 14th place on the League standings.</p>
      <p>The north Londoners have won three out of their last twelve games, and they have also failed to get a win in their last five matches in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's sacking at Tottenham brings to an end his five-and-a-half-years stay with Spurs where he has failed to win the League title or the Champions League.</p>
