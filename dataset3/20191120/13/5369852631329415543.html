      <p>STAR KERRY FORWARD Sarah Houlihan has announced her inter-county retirement after 13 years in the Green and Gold jersey.</p>
      <p>The three-time All-Star follows in the footsteps of 2019 captain and fellow stalwart Amanda Brosnan, who brought the curtain down on her own career earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Dr Crokes midfielder Brosnan, also 30, said: “All good things come to an end, wearing the Kerry jersey has been a huge honour.”</p>

      <p>And Houlihan, widely regarded as one of the best forwards in the game, echoed those sentiments in announcing her own departure from the panel this morning.</p>
      <p>“The privilege has been all mine,” Houlihan tweeted. “13 years of playing in the green &amp; gold jersey I feel it’s time I started a new chapter. </p>
      <p>“Has brought me to wonderful places, introduced me to lifelong friends &amp; given me millions of memories. Thank you to my family &amp; friends, forever grateful.”</p>

      <p>The Kingdom will now be without two stalwarts of the game for their assault on the 2020 campaign — but under new management in former Kerry footballer Declan Quill and his fellow ex-joint minor boss Darragh Long.</p>
      <p>The duo were ratified on a three-year term last month, with Geraldine O’Shea and Ann Marie O’Donoghue confirmed as selectors, and Cassandra Buckley as strength and conditioning coach.</p>

      <p>Kerry will now look to put a turbulent few years behind them, which has seen several <a href="https://www.the42.ie/ladies-football-kerry-new-manager-2019-4314473-Oct2018/">changes in management, relegation to Division 2 of the league and other off-the-field issues.</a></p>
      <p>After falling short in the decider last year, they’ll again contest the second tier of the league, while senior championship is on the cards following another quarter-final exit to eventual champions Dublin this summer.</p>
