      <h1>A new study offers a glimpse of the unrepentant Australian terrorist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Nick O'Malley</a></address>
      <p>New research has painted a chilling portrait of the “average" Australian Islamist terrorist by creating a database about 173 citizens or residents who have been charged with terrorist offences or joined terrorist organisations.</p>
      <p>An Australian terrorist is likely to share several characteristics. He is likely to be in his mid-20s from Sydney, born in Australia to overseas-born parents who are still married (with one or both from Lebanon). He is likely to be employed in a blue-collar job and not to have mental health issues.</p>

      <p>He is likely to have little contrition for his crimes and poor prospects for rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://interactives.lowyinstitute.org/features/typology-of-terror/">Lowy Institute study published on Thursday</a> found the popular perception of an Australian jihadi was wrong, and there were clear differences between Australian Islamist terrorists and those who came from Western Europe.</p>
      <p>Australian jihadist terrorists were more likely to have little or no criminal record, to be employed and to be more educated than European jihadis; but less likely than the average Australian.</p>
      <p>The study also found that while 84 per cent of Australian jihadis were men, women in the group were just as ideologically committed as their husbands or family members.</p>
      <p>“The concept of ‘jihadi or ISIS bride’ as a reluctant traveller without agency is largely inaccurate, at least with respect to this data set,” wrote the study’s author, Dr Rodger Shanahan, an Islamic studies specialist with Lowy who has formerly served as an army officer.</p>
      <p>Dr Shanahan constructed the database with information from trial documents, media reports, social media profiles as well as publicly available information such as business and charity registration data and interviews with journalists, government and law enforcement officials.</p>
      <p>The research found little link between refugee communities and terrorism.</p>
      <p>Among the 149 individuals whose ages are known, eight per cent were over the age of 35 and seven per cent were younger than 18. “This finding challenges the popular conception that attraction to radical Islamist causes decreases with age,” wrote Dr Shanahan. But the study also found the average age was 25, which is in keeping with the experience in other Western nations.</p>
      <p>Around 45 per cent were single and 45 per cent married, with 10 per cent divorced, indicating “attachment to spouses and families is not enough to dissuade someone from taking part in a high-risk activity such as terrorism.”</p>
      <p>About 40 per cent of those in the group had parents who had come to Australia from Lebanon, while only 20 per cent of Australian Muslims had that background. Dr Shanahan said his research did not explain that disparity, but that it could be related to the apparent significant influence of siblings in the radicalisation process.</p>
      <p>“At least 44 people comprising 19 sets of siblings feature in the terrorist database. In other words, siblings account for a quarter of all known contemporary Australian jihadis,” the report said.</p>
      <p>The research shows 34 per cent of the jihadis are first generation Australians, 60 per cent are second-generation and six per cent are third-generation. Most of that group are Anglo-Celtic converts to Islam.</p>
      <p>Of the 81 people whose education background is known, 27 per cent had not completed high school, almost exactly the rate for the rest of Australia, the research showed. Sixteen per cent of the individuals had completed tertiary study, which is less than the Australian average of 24 per cent.</p>
      <p>More than a quarter of those who began tertiary education had dropped out either before committing to Islamic State or in order to do so, which is higher than the national tertiary drop-out rate of around 20 per cent. Dr Shanahan found only 10 per cent of the jihadis whose educational background was known had studied generalist degrees in the humanities.</p>
      <p>“The data on jihadis’ tertiary choices may well support a conclusion that the greater the exposure to a liberal arts education that seeks to promote critical thinking, the less likely individuals are to be attracted to a rigid and intolerant ideological concepts such as radical Islamism,” he wrote.</p>
