      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/david-beckham/">David Beckham</a> is the king of jet-setting after he was spotted walking the streets of Berlin, before hot-footing it back to London to party with Ninja.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> footballer was seen taking in the sights of the German capital on Monday night, following a swanky Tudor watch party.</p>
      <p>At one point, the 44-year-old appeared to stage his own photoshoot by the Berlin wall, before squatting down to take selfies.</p>
      <p>Sharing a snap on his Instagram page, the dad-of-four wrote: ‘Flying visit to Berlin – Couldn’t resist a quick stop to see this iconic image… #BerlinWall.’</p>
      <p>Victoria Beckham’s husband looked seriously smart for the evening, rocking a grey tweed suit with shiny black shoes.</p>
      <p>But he didn’t get to spend too much time being a tourist, as he flew straight back to the UK to hit up the launch of the Adidas store in London.</p>

      <p>David headed straight for Oxford Street to celebrate the opening of the new show, alongside gaming legend Ninja.</p>

      <p>But, before the England ace got too comfortable, he was off again, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/david-beckham-millie-bobby-brown-headlining-un-summit-world-childrens-day-stan-hard-11187796/">flying to New York to headline the UN Summit on World Children’s Day</a>, with Millie Bobby Brown.</p>
      <p>Does the man ever rest?</p>
      <p>The pair will be appearing at a global summit, demanding action over the protection and promotion of child rights with UNICEF.</p>
      <p>And, in between all this jet-setting, he still found time to treat his brood to a firework display <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/david-beckham-pines-victoria-treats-brood-fun-night-fireworks-11048822/">as they spent bonfire night as a family, in London</a>.</p>

      <p>David recently opened up about being on dad duties, admitting he’s not that fussed that eldest son Brooklyn regularly takes clothes from his wardrobe.</p>
      <p>‘I see it as a good thing,’ <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/david-beckham-brooklyn-interview-clothes-a4291711.html">he told Evening Standard</a>. ‘I must be doing something pretty cool for a 20-year-old to be wanting to borrow my stuff.</p>
      <p>‘Definitely. But they [the kids] are not as tidy as me. So when I walk into my closet I can see [that], “Right OK… he [Brooklyn] has had those jeans, that jumper.”</p>

      <p>‘The other day he FaceTimed me from a restaurant. And I was like, “I have seen that suit somewhere before.” And I was like, “Mate, I have just bought that suit, I’ve not even worn it.”’</p>
      <p>He’s not a regular dad, he’s a cool dad…</p>
