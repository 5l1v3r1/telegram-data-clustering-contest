      <p>Emma Bunton urged “parents, caregivers and teachers” to teach children about their rights as she visited a school to mark World Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>The Spice Girl, who is an ambassador for Unicef UK, visited George Spicer Primary, Enfield, where she was given a tour by three pupils from the school’s Rights Respecting children’s council.</p>
      <p>Baby Spice said: “It’s been amazing to spend time with the children and to see how engaged and passionate they are learning about their rights – from the right to play to the right to have healthy food.</p>

      <p>“It’s something all children deserve and it’s so important that we as parents, caregivers and teachers encourage and support these fundamental rights.”</p>
      <p>World Children’s Day celebrates the power of children to change the world on November 20 annually.</p>
      <p>Bunton, 43, was shown a map which promoted respect for all and linked to Article Two of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which this year marks 30 years since its creation.</p>
      <p>It states child rights apply to every child “whatever their ethnicity, gender, religion, language, abilities or any other status, whatever they think or say, whatever their family background”.</p>
      <p>George Spicer Primary was made a Unicef Rights Respecting School after achieving the gold level of the Rights Respecting Schools Award.</p>

      <p>Unicef UK’s programme director for the Rights Respecting Schools Award Frances Bestley said: “We would like to thank the players of the People’s Postcode Lottery for their support, which helps us to work with schools across the UK to create safe and inspiring places to learn, where children are respected, their talents are nurtured and they are able to thrive.</p>
      <p>“Our Rights Respecting Schools Award embeds these values in daily school life and gives children the best chance to lead happy, healthy lives and to be responsible, active citizens.”</p>
      <p>Unicef’s Rights Respecting Schools Award has been supported by the People’s Postcode Lottery and their players for the past two years, raising more than £7 million.</p>
