      <h1>2020 Mini John Cooper Works GP Is Most Powerful Mini Ever</h1>
      <h2>Limited edition Mini lands in LA with over 300 hp.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:15:53+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Karl Furlong</a></address>
      <p>The new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mini/john-cooper-works-gp">Mini John Cooper Works GP</a> is said to be inspired by the marque's motor racing heroics, which goes some way to explaining the audacious bodywork and the fact that this is now the most powerful production Mini ever. The 2.0-liter turbo-four puts out 302 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque - a good 74 hp more than the regular <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mini/john-cooper-works-hardtop">JCW hatchback</a>. A free-flowing exhaust, a fettled turbocharger, and a larger-volume air intake are responsible for the power hike, a combination that should be enough for a five-second run to 60 mph, which will match the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/honda/civic-type-r">Honda Civic Type R</a>.</p>

      <p>Back to that design, though. Flared wheel arches (with carbon-fiber covers) and a rear wing with bright GP insignia are impossible to miss, while the chrome-embellished door handles and fuel filler cap of lesser Minis are replaced here with high-gloss black. The metallic Racing Gray paintwork contrasts with Chili Red and matte Rosso detailing on the face, the wheels, the lower doors, and inside that epic rear wing. The lightweight forged wheels measure 18 inches and feature four spokes - they're claimed to be the lightest ever 18-inch forged wheels to feature on a Mini.</p>
      <p>Together with the weight-saving measures, a stiffer suspension and widened track are bound to make the GP an even more thrilling drive than lower-powered Minis.</p>

      <p>The interior also has a few unique touches to set the GP apart. Aluminum shift paddles on the steering wheel were manufactured using 3D printing and continue the exterior's hexagonal theme. A decorative trim strip in the passenger section bears each GP's production number - only 3,000 units are set to be produced, ensuring exclusivity. Seating for rear passengers is, well, non-existent. In the interests of weight-saving, no rear seat is fitted at all. You will, however, find a red cross-brace back there.</p>
      <p>Pricing? Well, expect to cough up $44,900 for the GP. That's well over $10,000 more than the regular John Cooper Works, but this is also the fastest and most outrageous Mini you can buy. Deliveries have been earmarked for March 2020.</p>
