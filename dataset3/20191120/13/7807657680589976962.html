      <p><b>Best answer:</b> While we don't know the exact size of the world in Diablo IV, we do know it'll be the biggest game in the series yet. Blizzard has explicitly confirmed that not only will Diablo IV be larger than any past games but the entire overworld is all connected.</p>

      <h4>Just how big is the world of Diablo IV?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> is aiming to be the largest game in the series yet and the size of the world is just a part of that. Blizzard has confirmed that the world will be larger than past Diablo games and that for the first time, the overworld will be entirely connected. That means that if players aren't inside a tavern, inn, dungeon or other self-contained area, the whole world is open to be explored.</p>
      <h4>What is the world of Diablo IV like?</h4>
      <p>In Diablo IV, the world is divided into five distinct regions: Scosglen, Fractured Peaks, Dry Steppes, Hawezar and Kejhistan. Scosglen is a forest region where werewolves and Goatmen lurk, the Fractured Peaks are a snowy mountainous area, the Dry Steppes are home to brutal clans, Hawezar is a swamp where witches practice their craft, and Kejhistan is filled with wind-swept ruins. Each region is designed to feel different, with unique enemy types not found elsewhere. Parts of the world will even be open for PvP, further increasing the danger of travelling through.</p>
      <h4>What threats lurk in the world of Diablo IV?</h4>

      <p>Diablo IV is a dark, Gothic world, one where monsters roam freely, packs of bestial Goatmen stalk unwary travelers, and evil lurks everywhere. Lilith, daughter of Hatred, Queen of Succubi, and one of the creators of Sanctuary, has returned. The reveal trailer for when Diablo IV was announced further emphasized this tone, showing a world of evil and darkness.</p>
