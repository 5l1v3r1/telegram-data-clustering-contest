      <p>Leading digital bank Revolut is partnering with Mastercard to help repair four schools destroyed by  Cyclone Idai in Mozambique. The charitable project is also in support of Universal Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>According to Revolut, customers are able to round up their spare change and donate the difference, set up a recurring payment, or give a one-off amount via the Revolut Donations feature. Revolut and Mastercard said they will match every £1 donated by Revolut Mastercard users up to a total of £80,000, with an aim to fundraise £160,000 in total for the cause.</p>
      <p>Importantly, Revolut said that one hundred percent of the amount donated by customers goes to charity, with Revolut and Mastercard charging no fees and taking no cut from donations.</p>
      <p>Marsel Nikaj, Product Owner for Vaults &amp; Donations at Revolut commented:</p>
      <blockquote>“We launched our Donations feature in July to make charitable donations simple, flexible and transparent. We hope that our partnership with Save the Children and Mastercard will help children affected by Cyclone Idai get the important education they deserve.”</blockquote>
      <p>Edoardo Volta, Head of Fintech Partnerships at Mastercard said they are delighted to be partnering with Revolut:</p>
      <blockquote>“Education is the passport to a better future and by raising these funds we hope to be able to offer that to the children affected by Cyclone Idai.”</blockquote>
