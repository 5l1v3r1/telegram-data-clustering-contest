      <h1>Oscar-winning visual effects artist Phil Tippett on the 30-year journey of Mad God</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:38:30+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Volmers</a></address>
      <p>“I’m done with dinosaurs, space aliens and giant robots.”</p>
      <p>For fans of Oscar-winning visual effects wizard Phil Tippett’s most famous creations, this may seem a depressing pronouncement. After more than 40 years in the business, Tippett’s pioneering work has included everything from looming Imperial Walkers in the Empire Strikes Back to the supercool alien chess set in the original Star Wars and the menacing Enforcement Droid 209 in Paul Verhoeven’s RoboCop. When he reluctantly switched from stop-motion to computer-generated effects in the early 1990s, he supervised the animation for Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park and created those horrifying alien arachnids in Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers.</p>
      <p>But when asked to reflect on his amazing body of work, he says he doesn’t pick favourites, nor does he harbour much nostalgia for his past achievements.</p>
      <p>“I just don’t think about stuff I’ve done in the past very much at all,” says Tippett, in an interview from his studio in Berkeley. “I just kind of move on. The experiences that I’ve enjoyed the most are the two pictures I did with Verhoeven because we think more alike, politically. The subject matter was a bit more meaty than the PG-13 general fare.”</p>

      <p>While the visual effects of both Starship Troopers and RoboCop were dazzling, the films were also dark satires posing as big-budget action films. For anyone familiar with Tippett’s Mad God project, it’s hardly surprising that his dark vision would lean closer to Verhoeven than to George Lucas.</p>
      <p>Tippett will be among the guests at the Giant Incandescent Resonating Animation Festival (GIRAF) weekend, a celebration of all things animated. He will give an artist talk on Nov. 23 in the afternoon and will also screen Mad God, Parts 1-3 at the Globe Cinema later that night.</p>
      <p>While the first Mad God film wasn’t released until 2014, Tippett has been chipping away at the concept for the past 30 years. Using stop-motion animation, the films’ nightmarish narrative is described as “shambling hordes of Sh-t-Men stagger and splatter through the unearthly subterranean chambers of Mad God, a world of beautiful, handcrafted monstrosities … ”</p>
      <p>“Kind of like everything else in my life, it was inspired during childhood,” Tippett says. “My dad was an abstract painter and had half-a-decent art library. He turned me onto a book with a bunch of reproductions of Hieronymus Bosch paintings of heaven and hell. His hell paintings were pretty amazing. Even back then, at the age of 10 years old or so, I started to think how it would be cool to see something like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. After working on all these successful movies, I just got tired of the traditional three-act structure and the hoops you have to jump through to make a commercial. I’ve always wanted to see stuff that was different, that I had never seen before.”</p>

      <p>Tippett says he has one more shot to complete before releasing the Mad God project theatrically in the next couple of years. After building his own studio in the 1980s, Tippett put together a volunteer crew and spent eight months filming the first six minutes of Mad God using stop-motion animation.</p>
      <p>“The digital revolution hit and my wife and I had a couple of kids, so that kind of stopped everything for about 20 years in terms of being able to produce anything,” he says. “But that allowed me the time to do all the research that I did, studying the unconscious and reading up on Jung and Freud and studying other esoteric psychologies and mythologies and religions and stuff like that. The conceptual work was done in that intervening 20 years in whatever spare time I had. Then, about 10 years ago, I got a bunch of volunteers, who were people that as kids were inspired by the movies that I had worked on previously.”</p>
      <p>Tippett himself was inspired by those who came before him. As a child, he vividly remembers the impact of seeing visual effects artist Willis O’Brien’s work in the 1933 King Kong movie. He was also enamoured by the work of Ray Harryhausen on films such as The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.</p>
      <p>While Tippett says he entered the digital revolution “kicking and screaming,” he has enjoyed a great deal of success since the changeover. Jurassic Park earned him his second Oscar in 1994, after winning his first one 10 years earlier for Return of the Jedi. He was also visual effects supervisor for the Twilight Saga films.</p>
      <p>For now, Tippett says he’s got some other ideas for new projects once he finally completes Mad God.</p>
      <p>“I’m 68 years old now and if I live long enough I’ll do another one,” he says with a laugh. “I’m not going to take 30 years to do it again. If I get lucky and can find the money and can hire a crew to expedite it, then I’ve got other ideas. They are using very similar approaches but a very different kind of narrative structure that I haven’t completely determined yet. I have an idea, but it will take me a few years to figure out what that is.”</p>
