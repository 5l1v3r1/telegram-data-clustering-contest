      <p>An on-call teacher on Vancouver Island has been suspended for yelling at, belittling and pushing young students.</p>
      <p>Jason Alexander Hop Wo was teaching a Grade 4/5 class in the Cowichan Valley on Dec. 10 to 15, 2015, when the events occurred, according to an agreed statement of facts posted by the B.C. Commissioner for Teacher Regulation.</p>
      <p>During this time, Hop Wo frequently yelled at and belittled students in the class, telling one student that “because the student behaved like a kindergartener, the student would be treated like one.”</p>
      <p>He grabbed a student’s shirt and physically moved the child, according to the document, and grabbed a student by the wrist in another incident.</p>
      <p>While on a field trip, Hop Wo took away two students’ snacks inside a theatre while he sat there eating.</p>
      <p>The document also says Hop Wo shoved a student in the hallway because he thought the student was talking, and gave detentions to four students for not following his directions to run, when they were assisting another teacher.</p>
      <p>On Jan. 4 and 5, 2016, Hop Wo was also found to have frequently yelled at Grade 3/4 students, using words such as “fool,” “panty face” and telling an entire class that they “suck.”</p>
      <p>He made two students cry, one by yelling to get out of the classroom, and another by throwing a piece of paper at a student’s head, according to the document.</p>
      <p>He also told a student to stop whining and chucked another kid’s crayons in the garbage when the student didn’t complete a task fast enough.</p>
      <p>Hop Wo resigned from the on-call list in 2016 after being disciplined by the school district but was hired in 2017 by School District 68 (Nanaimo-Ladysmith) to teach at an elementary school.</p>
      <p>In April 2018, he had “inappropriate physical contact” with a Grade 2 student in his class. The document says Hop Wo intervened in an argument between two students by picking up one of the students by the shoulders and yelling “move now.”</p>
      <p>The school district suspended him without pay and he completed an anger management course.</p>
      <p>The B.C. Commissioner for Teacher Regulation has suspended his certificate of qualification for one week for professional misconduct and he has been ordered to take a course on creating a positive learning environment through the Justice Institute of B.C.</p>
