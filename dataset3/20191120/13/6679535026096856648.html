      <h1>Vigilance probe sought into KIRTADS affairs</h1>
      <h2>Unauthorised appointments and graft alleged</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:21:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:21</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>A group of activists has sought a probe by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau into the alleged corruption at the Kerala Institute for Research, Training and Development Studies of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (KIRTADS) here and urged the government to convert it into an independent research institution.</p>
      <p>The government is yet to appoint a full-time director for KIRTADS after S. Bindu was transferred from the post around two years ago. P. Pugazhendi, Director, Department for the Development of Scheduled Tribes, had been given the additional charge. It has been claimed that Mr. Pugazhendi, an officer belonging to the Indian Forest Service, is not fully involved in its functioning because of his other responsibilities. This has reportedly hit the research and development works. Many staff members are appointed on contract basis and there has been allegations of nepotism in recruitment too.</p>
      <p>The activists demanded that 50% of the total staff there be recruited from Dalit and Adivasi communities as the institution is dependent on the funds from the government departments set up for their welfare. They also demanded that the employees who had been “illegally” appointed be terminated from service.</p>
      <p>A march was taken out to the KIRTADS office on Wednesday raising these issues.</p>
      <p>Sunny M. Kapikkad, public intellectual and author, who inaugurated the march, alleged that KIRTADS had strayed away from its responsibility of conducting research that would help Dalits and Adivasis and submit reports to the government. Quoting a recent report by the Accountant General’s office, he said that there had been corruption amounting to lakhs of rupees and unauthorised appointments. The institution was also blocking the higher education prospects of Dalit and Adivasi students by incorrectly determining their caste status, he added.</p>
      <p>K. Santhosh Kumar, another activist, pointed out that KIRTADS had not so far devised policies aimed at the comprehensive development of Dalits and Adivasis. Training Adivasis in archery and dance was some of the programmes being undertaken there, he said.</p>
      <p>A majority of the staff there don’t have required qualification in anthroplogy and sociology. Hundreds of students were denied opportunity to study engineering and medicine due to the incorrect caste determination by the KIRTADS staff, Mr. Santhosh alleged.</p>
