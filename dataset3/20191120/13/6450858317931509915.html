      <p>The Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, which we mentioned earlier, comes with the highest discount at £190 off – this brings the price down to £459 from its original RRP of £699.99. See this deal <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-256GB-Storage-6-6-Inch-Smartphone-Green/dp/B07TD978VF?ascsubtag=06-3778192-11-0000000">on Amazon </a>or <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2264&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3778192-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carphonewarehouse.com%2Foppo%2Freno-10x-zoom.html%23%21colour%3Dblack%26capacity%3D256GB%26dealType%3Dsf">Carphone Warehouse</a>.</p>
      <p>The Reno 10x Zoom boasts incredible cameras. You get a particularly impressive 10x telephoto zoom (duh) that's powered both by the 13Mp 5x optical telephoto lens and the 48Mp sensor of the main camera, leading to a lossless digital-optical hybrid zoom, but which looks like a fully optical telephoto zoom.</p>
      <p>The 10x Zoom also offers a 16Mp pop-up front facing camera which frees up the gorgeous 6.6in AMOLED display from a notch. See our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-3695628/">full review of the Reno 10x Zoom</a> (4.5/5 stars, Tech Advisor recommended).</p>

      <p>The Reno comes with an <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oppo-reno-3695669/">impressive 6.4in AMOLED screen</a> and a pop-up camera like the one found on the 10x Zoom, creating an edge-to-edge screen experience. The main camera offers a 48Mp sensor, and under the hood your get 6GB RAM, 256GB storage.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-CPH1979-Aurora-Purple-RENO/dp/B07VLYNNMG?ascsubtag=06-3778192-11-0000000"><b>Reno Z has £80 off</b>, bringing the price to £199</a>. </p>
      <p>Despite its mid-range price, the Reno Z offers a stunningly bright and crisp 6.4in AMOLED display and speedy performance – a couple reasons why the phone received <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/smartphones/oppo-reno-z-3700644/">4/5 stars in our review.</a> With a strong dynamic range and HDR10 support, it's particularly well-suited for watching YouTube or Netflix.

      <h3>Oppo RX17 phones - up to £100 off</h3>

      <p>The Oppo RX17 Pro and RX17 Neo are also on offer with £100 and £66 off, respectively. With the discount, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-128GB-Storage-6-4-Inch-Smartphone-Blue/dp/B07TRTRZMT?ascsubtag=06-3778192-11-0000000">Oppo RX17's price goes down to £249</a>, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-128GB-Storage-6-4-Inch-Smartphone-Blue/dp/B07TPC5HNP?ascsubtag=06-3778192-11-0000000">RX17 Neo's price reduces to £159</a>.</p>
      <p>While these phones may not boast the same strengths as the Reno models, they are still reasonable options if you're looking for a discount on mid-range phones with good performance and strong displays.</p>
