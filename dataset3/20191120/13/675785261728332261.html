      <h2>England will learn their opponents at next summer's tournament as they bid to win the European Championships for the very first time</h2>

      <p>England could face world champions France and holders Portugal at next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p>The pots for the Euro 2020 draw have been confirmed, with England confirmed as one of the top seeds as a host nation.</p>
      <p>The draw, which will take place on November 30, involves the top-two finishers in the ten qualifying groups and the eventual four play-off winners.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate's men will go straight into Group C, and will be joined by Scotland if they can overcome their play offs.</p>
      <p>But they could face a potential group of death, if they are drawn alongside France and Portugal.</p>

      <p>France are in Pot B, alongside World Cup runners-up Croatia and Netherlands.</p>
      <p>But the Dutch will not be drawn alongside England as they are also a host nation, and are in Group C.</p>
      <p>Host nations have been placed automatically in set groups to ensure at least two of their group games are at home.</p>
      <p>Wales, who secured their place at the tournament by beating Hungary on Tuesday night, have gone into Pot 4.</p>
