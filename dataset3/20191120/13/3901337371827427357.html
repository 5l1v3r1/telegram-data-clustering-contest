      <p>The Brazilian, who is currently sidelined with an injury, was desperate to return to the Camp Nou ahead of the 2019/20 campaign but had to stay after both clubs failed to reach an agreement.</p>
      <p>Neymar had since returned to playing for Paris Saint-Germain but picked up an injury during the previous international break.</p>

      <p>According to <i>Sport</i>, PSG are keen to extend his current deal which runs until 2022 for another three years, but the Brazilian is not interested.</p>
      <p>Even though his father, who is also one of agents, and the club have been in talks since last year already, Neymar Snr. has reportedly been putting some ridiculous requests on the table, which PSG are unable to match.</p>

      <p>As a consequence, the Ligue 1 leaders could be looking into selling their want-away superstar as long as his transfer value is still high, while Barcelona are understood to have remained interested on his acquisition.</p>
