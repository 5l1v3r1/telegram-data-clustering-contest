      <blockquote>“It is alleged that on October 15 at about 14:30 the victim left her residential place, Elawini Lifestyle Estate in Mbombela, and went to Crossing Shopping Centre. She was supposed to fetch her child from school later, but did not. Her husband became worried after he failed to get hold of her.”</blockquote>
