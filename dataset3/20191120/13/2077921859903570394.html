      <h1>John Mulaney's New Netflix Special Arrives on Christmas Eve</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:18:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:18</time> by <a rel="author">Rachita Vasandani  </a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/John+Mulaney">John Mulaney</a>  is back on Netflix with a new children’s variety special titled <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/John+Mulaney">John Mulaney</a> &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch</i>.</p>
      <p>Launching globally on Dec. 24, the show “aims to recapture the magic of that bygone television era when children sang songs about their feelings with celebrity guests on funky outdoor sets,” per a <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a> press release. It’s a bit of a different direction from Mulaney’s 2018 Netflix stand-up special <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/05/john-mulaney-continues-his-winning-streak-with-kid.html">Kid Gorgeous</a></i>, but maybe it’s just what we need to finish 2019 off strong.</p>
      <p>Mulaney describes his new special as follows in a statement:</p>
      <p>I’m John Mulaney and I am a 37-year-old man. The Sack Lunch Bunch is a group of children ages 8-13 who are more talented than me. In this special, we are joined by celebrity guests like David Byrne, Tony Award Winner Andre De Shields, Natasha Lyonne, Annaleigh Ashford, Shereen Pimentel, Richard Kind and <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Jake+Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> from the movie <i>Zodiac</i>. The result is a collage of Broadway-caliber showstoppers, comedy sketches for all ages, meditations on the unknown from children and adults, and a papier-mâché volcano. It’s funny, musical, joyous, anxious and surprisingly profound.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Netflix">Netflix</a>  announced <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/03/john-mulaney-new-netflix-special-kid-gorgeous-at-r.html">a multi-special deal</a> with Mulaney in spring 2018, which began with <i>Kid Gorgeous</i> and continues with his new show. <i>Paste</i> ranked the comedian among <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/12/the-best-comedians-of-2018.html">last year’s best</a>.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/John+Mulaney">John Mulaney</a> &amp; The Sack Lunch Bunch</i> is directed by <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/02/documentary-now-directors-rhys-thomas-and-alex-buo.html">Rhys Thomas</a> and is available to stream Christmas Eve.</p>
