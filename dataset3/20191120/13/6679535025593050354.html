      <p>The Indian Naval Academy (INA), located at Ezhimala in Kerala, which trains Naval officers, was on Wednesday awarded the President’s Colour by the President of India and the Supreme Commander of the Indian Armed Forces Ram Nath Kovind, on completion of 50 years.</p>
      <p>The President’s Colour, the highest honour that is bestowed upon a military unit, was received by Academy Cadet Captain Sushil Singh at a parade comprising 730 cadets of INA and a 150-men Guard of Honour.</p>
      <p>“The President’s Colour should serve as the motivating symbol to inspire and mould a generation of officers that will pass out from this world-class institution,” Mr. Kovind said, addressing the gathering. He also released a special postal cover to commemorate the occasion.</p>
      <p>The INA was first established at a temporary location at Kochi in 1969, relocated to <i>INS</i> Mandovi at Goa in 1986, and finally moved to its permanent location at Ezhimala in 2009. INA, Ezhimala, over a period of 10 years has commissioned 5,930 officers into the Indian Navy and Coast Guard, including 531 women officers, the Navy said in a statement. The INA has a present strength of 963 trainees, including 44 women trainees and 26 trainees from friendly foreign countries.</p>
      <p>The Indian Navy was the first of the three Services to be awarded the President’s Colour on May 27, 1951.</p>
