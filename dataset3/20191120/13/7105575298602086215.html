      <h1>Jennifer Lopez Says She Wasn't Paid a Cent to Make 'Hustlers'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:14:11+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">Lena de Casparis</a></address>
      <p>Despite the title of her summer box office hit, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/celebrity-style/g28491328/jennifer-lopez-best-looks/">Jennifer Lopez</a> is not all about the hustle. This week, the singer and actress revealed that she wasn’t actually paid upfront for her leading role—nor her producer credit—in the Lorene Scarfaria-directed film <i><a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a28794475/constance-wu-hustlers-interview/">Hustlers</a>. </i>The film explores the true story of group of strippers who swindled Wall Street bankers out of thousands of dollars, and is based on a <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2015/12/robin-hood-strippers-scores-c-v-r.html">2015<i> New York Magazine </i>article</a>. J.Lo starred in the film alongside <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/a28794475/constance-wu-hustlers-interview/">Constance Wu</a>, <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a41626/cardi-b-explains-simple-meaning-feminism/">Cardi B</a>, and <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/g28931063/lizzo-summer-2019-vmas-beyonce-glastonbury/">Lizzo</a>.</p>

      <p>In an interview with <i><a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019">GQ</a>, </i>the 50-year-old opened up the most memorable moments from her career to date, and why money wasn't the driving force behind her decision to be involved in the film.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t get paid a whole bunch of money for <i>Hustlers,' </i>she told the publication.<i> </i>'I did it for free and produced it. I bank on myself. Like Jenny From the Block — I do what I want, I do what I love."</p>
      <p>When asked if she thinks she is similar to her character Ramona in the film, she said: "I’ve never been motivated by money. I’ve always been motivated by wanting to be a great singer, a great actor, a great dancer, I want to make movies, I want to make music. And the money came along with that."</p>

      <p>During the interview, Lopez also discussed the secret to her relationship with fiancé <a href="https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/celebrity-style/a29510359/jennifer-lopez-wedding-dress-alex-rodriguez/">Alex Rodriguez</a>, explaining that they are both equally ambitious and focused on success.</p>
      <p>"We're both super-hard workers," she said. "We're driven by our passions. And we have a tremendous amount of respect for each other. He wants me to be seen and to get what I deserve. Like, he's made his half a billion. And he's like, “I want you to have that”."</p>

      <p>As a producer on <i>Hustlers</i>, it's likely that Lopez will have received dividends post-release; the film grossed an estimated $148.5 million worldwide. Either way, with an<a href="http://money.com/money/5638106/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-engaged-net-worth-2019/"> estimated net worth of over $400 million</a>, Lopez can afford to put her passions ahead of the of the odd paycheck. Especially as she's now receiving Oscar buzz for her part in the hit film.</p>
