      <p>After years of belt-tightening, school leaders and teachers have been lobbying for investment in the nation’s schools, and it now seems that politicians are responding.</p>
      <p>Per pupil spending in England has dropped by 8% in real terms since 2010, fuelled by a number of factors including the increasing cost of pay, pensions and national insurance contributions.</p>
      <p>As the General Election campaign ramps up a gear and the political parties prepare to launch their manifestos, it is likely that many will be flashing the cash.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– What are the Conservatives’ plans?</b>
      </p>

      <p>With their manifesto yet to be published, the detail is not yet known.</p>
      <p>However, in a blaze of publicity, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced in August a three-year plan to increase school spending by £7.1 billion by 2022/23.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a respected economic think tank, has said the investment returns school funding to 2009/10 levels.</p>
      <p>The Government has announced proposals to raise starting salaries for teachers to £30,000 by 2022/23.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives are also focusing on discipline and standards in the classroom.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– And how about Labour?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Again, Labour’s manifesto has not yet been published, but it is expected that there will be some announcement on cash for schools.</p>
      <p>The party has been clear that it wants to create a “cradle-to-grave” national education service, and has already pledged that every adult will be entitled to six years of free study.</p>
      <p>Other policies already announced include plans to offer 30 hours of free childcare to all two to four-year-olds, to open new Sure Start children’s centres, to cut class sizes for five to seven-year-olds, to scrap primary school Sats tests and give primary school children free school dinners.</p>

      <p>Labour also plans to scrap university tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Wasn’t there a plan for Labour to abolish private schools?</b>
      </p>
      <p>At its conference in September, Labour passed a resolution which put forward sweeping plans to overhaul private education and “integrate” fee-paying schools into the state sector.</p>
      <p>The motion covered a proposal to withdraw charitable status and “all other public subsidies and tax privileges”, including business rates exemption.</p>
      <p>Properties and investment held by private schools would be “redistributed democratically and fairly” across the country’s educational institutions as part of the reforms.</p>
      <p>The move was immediately met with outrage from private school leaders, who have vowed to fight any such move.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known if these proposals have indeed become part of Labour’s election manifesto.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Where do the Lib Dems stand?</b>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://image.assets.pressassociation.io/v2/image/production/5c74c7a22d970dfc412bffeba981df18Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaCwxNTc0MzQyMDQ2/2.48463155.jpg?w=1280"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats’ manifesto includes a pledge that by 2024/25, £10.6 billion more will be spent on schools than in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>This money will help to boost teacher numbers by 20,000 over five years, the party says.</p>
      <p>Teachers are a key focus of the Lib Dems’ education plans, with pledges to increase starting salaries to £30,000 and guaranteeing pay rises over at least 3% a year over the next parliament.</p>
      <p>The party also says it will invest in professional development for teachers, support for youngsters with special educational needs and disabilities and put £7 billion into building classrooms over a five-year period.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– So do these pledges match what school leaders want?</b>
      </p>

      <p>The Association of School and College Leaders has warned politicians against using education as a “political football” in the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>Instead, it is calling on politicians of all parties to focus on issues such as funding, reforms to the exams system, and teacher recruitment and retention.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– And what do teachers say?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, funding is also an issue for teachers.</p>
      <p>The National Education Union, which represents a significant proportion of the workforce, argues that more investment is needed, quickly.</p>
      <p>It also wants to see politicians commit to measures to reform areas such as Sats tests, Ofsted, workload and pay.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Do the parties’ pledges on education apply to the whole of the UK?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Education is a devolved area, so most of the pledges made by the parties on schools will apply to England only.</p>
