      <p>Sally Phillips has revealed the first details of the much anticipated Miranda anniversary special – and bear with…it actually sounds like such fun.</p>
      <p>The actress, who plays Miranda’s always busy pal Tilly (great name), appeared on Loose Women, and it didn’t take long for the girls to pry about what to expect.</p>
      <p>‘We recorded a 10-year anniversary variety show at the Palladium about a week ago…’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t know how much I’m able to tell you about that!’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But once she’d started, the panellists pounced for more info about the much-loved show.</p>
      <p>Sally then teased: ‘I did some dancing and that was a challenge.’</p>
      <p>‘But I was so stressed out about the dancing I think I was a bit rubbish at the talking.’</p>

      <p>‘We had lots of people on it – I can’t tell you who any of them are,’ she added. ‘But obviously, Sarah Hadland, who is the backbone of that show really.</p>
      <p>‘Some really touching VTs of crazy women who have modelled their friendship on the Miranda and Stevie friendship, which was really sweet.’</p>
      <p>So we’re going to have to keep all our fingers crossed for an appearance from Patricia Hodge, Tom Ellis or…most importantly, Miranda’s fruit friends.</p>

      <p>Miranda confirmed the show would return to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/19/miranda-confirmed-10th-anniversary-reunion-fun-will-tom-ellis-return-10426464/">celebrate the show’s 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary</a>, and will air before the New Year.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter with a statement, Miranda wrote: ‘Hello to you – I am with news. So, in November it will be 10 years since the first episode of Miranda aired. We are 10! And we have decided to have a party.</p>
      <p>‘The Miranda cast on and off screen are all about play, being free to be ourselves and silliness, so we are amazed and delighted that BBC One have agreed that our celebrations will be recorded as a one-hour special later in the year.’</p>

      <p>‘I will keep you posted but I suspect there might just be some special guests, probably the odd bit of dancing, definitely some drinks and nibbles,’ she continued.</p>
      <p>The show is clearly dear for those involved, with Tom, who is currently in Los Angeles shooting cult hit Lucifer, recently marked the airing of the first episode with a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/lucifers-tom-ellis-celebrates-10-year-anniversary-miranda-will-always-precious-time-11070922/">throwback to melt fans’ hearts.</a></p>
