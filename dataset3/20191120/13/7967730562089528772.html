      <h1>Accused fraudster Helen Rosamond charged with another $19 million in offences linked to NAB fraud</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Cormack</a></address>
      <p>The director of a company accused of defrauding the National Australia Bank of millions of dollars has been charged with a further 12 offences linked to the swindling of another $19 million.</p>
      <p>Helen Rosamond, former director of Human Group, was first charged with fraud and corruption offences in March after she allegedly participated in a large-scale fraud in partnership with Rosemary Rogers, former chief of staff to then-NAB chief executive Andrew Thorburn.</p>

      <p>The new offences take the total number of charges against Ms Rosamond to 74, with an alleged total value of $26.7 million.</p>
      <p>Ms Rosamond will be served the new charges on Thursday when she appears at Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court.</p>
      <p>The charges follow months of investigation by the NSW fraud squad, which seized reams of paperwork and devices during raids earlier this year, producing a 10,000-page forensic accounting report.</p>
      <p>Ms Rosamond has been on bail since her arrest over the scheme, in which Ms Rogers allegedly "rubber-stamped" falsified invoices from the Human Group between 2013 and 2017, in exchange for extravagant bribes.</p>

      <p>Among them was<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p512s0.html"> a $2.2-million invoice in 2017,</a> which the co-accused allegedly falsely claimed related to the events firm's role in "on-boarding" former NSW premier Mike Baird, who the bank was then courting as a new recruit for an executive position.</p>
      <p>Police allege bribes such as first-class travel, overseas holidays and pre-paid credit cards were provided to Ms Rogers to maintain the $40-million contract between the bank and the Human Group, which organised executive events for NAB for around 12 years.</p>

      <p>Ms Rosamond now faces 59 charges of corruptly giving an agent benefit and 11 of dishonestly obtaining benefit by deception.</p>
      <p>She has also been charged with attempting to dishonestly obtain benefit by deception, using false documents to obtain financial advantage and publishing false or misleading material to obtain advantage.</p>
      <p>To date, Mrs Rogers has been charged with 57 offences, all of which relate to NAB. Fifty-six counts concern corruptly giving an agent a benefit. Both women are yet to enter a plea on the matter.</p>
      <p>In August court documents obtained by <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52jpi.html"> revealed that Ms Rosamond herself received a series of allegedly "secret commissions"</a> via first-class trips overseas with spending money, a boat and more than $100,000 in house repairs.</p>
      <p>The alleged "secret commissions" were laid bare in documents filed by NAB in the Supreme Court of NSW in August, as part of a civil action against Ms Rosamond and Human Group, seeking an unspecified sum be returned to shareholders.</p>
