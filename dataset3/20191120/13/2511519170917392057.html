      <p>Maude Rose ‘Lores’ Bonney, who made history as first woman to fly solo from <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Australia">Australia</a> to England in a gruelling 157-hour journey, was born 122 years ago today.</p>
      <p>The milestone is being marked with a Google Doodle, which pays tribute to a woman who made her mark on the world during the infancy of aviation.</p>
      <p>Doodle creator Matt Cruickshank said he was inspired by her story: “I grew up reading boys’ adventure comics about male explorers. Bonney’s accomplishments are straight out of a girls’ adventure comic and are equally as important. She can be an inspiration for everyone.”</p>
      <p>Bonney travelled through heavy storms, survived two crashes, and even ran into a herd of water buffalo during her 1933 voyage.</p>
      <p>Born in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SouthAfrica">South Africa</a>, and raised in England then Australia, her passion for flying was sparked when she was a passenger on a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/flight">flight</a> with her husband’s brother In 1928.</p>
      <p>Within two years, she’d dedicated herself to flying, heading out on her first solo flight on a biplane called <i>My Little Ship</i> – a 15-hour journey from Brisbane, Queensland, for dinner with her father in Wangaratta, Victoria.</p>
      <p>Not content with her 1933 feat from Australia to the UK, four years later she became the first person to fly solo from Australia to South Africa.</p>
      <p>Flight technology was a far cry from what’s standard now – she had to do all of her own <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/plane">plane</a> maintenance, and had to navigate her way halfway across the world without a radio.</p>

      <p>Next on her list was a round-the-world trip via Japan, Alaska and the US, but the outbreak of the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/SecondWorldWar">Second World War</a> put paid to that.</p>
      <p>She died in Queensland in 1994, aged 97.</p>
