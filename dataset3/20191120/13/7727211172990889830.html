      <p>Pupils from a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/wirral">Wirral</a> primary school welcomed a star visitor to open their new sports hall on Thursday, November 7.</p>
      <p>Former England and Liverpool footballer John Barnes cut the ribbon to officially open the new facility at <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/new-brighton">New Brighton</a> Primary School, Vaughan Road, on what was his 56th and his son Alexander’s ninth birthday.</p>
      <p>The children welcomed John and sang happy birthday as head teacher Coleen Hibbard presented him with a fantastic red velvet cake, complete with LFC crest, that she had baked for him at home.</p>
      <p>John was happy to take time out of his big day to help promote sport in school: “Sport is very important for children as it teaches them teamwork, it teaches them discipline, it teaches them togetherness,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So, when you can have facilities which endorse all aspects of teamwork, it is fantastic.”</p>
      <p>He added that sport in schools is vital for developing the next generation of sports stars: “Before you are in an academy or before you become a 16-year old footballer, you do sport in school.</p>
      <p>“So, it is the first step of the ladder for you to become a sportsperson.”</p>
      <p>The school sports hall, which was recently built by Wirral council, provides the pupils, aged 3-11, with a dedicated place to play sports in school.</p>
      <p>Children, staff, chair of governors Lin Cook, Wirral Council Estates Strategy and Projects Manager Mike Woosey, architect Christopher Michael and local residents watched as John cut the ribbon.</p>
      <p>After the opening ceremony, head teacher Mrs Hibbard took John on a tour of the school, which has nearly 650 pupils.</p>
      <p>John took time out to meet the children in each class and even signed a few autographs.</p>
      <p>Mrs Hibbard said: “John is a great role model for the children.</p>
      <p>“They are intrigued by anyone who is a celebrity and he has been great, going around talking to the children and sharing important things like tolerance of others and hard work.</p>
      <p>“He was the right choice of person.”</p>
      <p>John took his personalised birthday cake to share with his family.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m honoured to receive the cake on my birthday and it is my son’s birthday as well, so I will take some home for him.”</p>
      <p>When asked about her choice of cake, Mrs Hibbard said she believed the toffee in banoffee - John’s favourite flavour - would be too closely associated with Liverpool’s rivals Everton.</p>
      <p>“For a Liverpool FC cake with red icing, a toffee cake just seemed wrong in so many ways.</p>
      <p>“Red velvet was much more fitting,” she said.</p>
