      <p>Two and a half months passed between the time <a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Three_Technique"><b>Three Technique</b></a> hopped on the <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby</a></b> Radar and his Wednesday return to the races. Sidelined due to a reported lung infection, the colt reappeared looking like a serious horse in allowance company at Aqueduct.</p>
      <p>Three Technique bided his time at the break, sitting last of five but in the clear, before looping around his rivals through the turn. Jockey Irad Ortiz Jr. had the son of Mr Speaker under wraps essentially the entire furlong of a race that should put Three Technique on the Derby trail.</p>
      <p>Off as a 1-9 shot, Three Technique chased opening splits of 23.24 seconds for the quarter mile and 47.22 for the opening half before finishing up in 1:25.65 for 7/8 of a mile. He went widest of four to grab the lead and never came close to a full drive, showing a grinding running style and distinguishable low head carriage. It was 4 1/2 lengths back to second.</p>
      <p>NFL Hall of Famer Bill Parcells’ August Dawn Farm campaigns the $180,000 yearling purchase, who was making his fourth start in the $75,000 flight for horses who were non-winners of two races entering.</p>

      <p>Three Technique was a beaten favorite when second on debut June 14 at Belmont Park and again a runner-up July 21 at Saratoga. But on Aug. 31 at the Spa, when stretched out to 7/8 of a mile, he delivered a rally to remember. As the chart stats, Three Technique “closed stoutly offering a good finishing outside,” in the process going from next to last in a field of nine to a 5 1/2-length victory.</p>
      <p>From there, Three Technique was set to contest the Oct. 5 Champagne Stakes (G1) won by Tiz the Law at Belmont. But the Daily Racing Form’s David Grening reported via trainer Jeremiah Engelhart the lung infection. Three Technique hopped back on the work Oct. 26, bringing three breezes into Wednesday’s win.</p>
      <p>With a number of Derby trail options in front of Three Technique, the Jan. 1 Jerome Stakes back at Aqueduct looks like a fit. It could also attract Independence Hall, Las Vegas’ early Kentucky Derby favorite after his romp in the Nashua Stakes (G3). Three Technique was last seen on the board at 65-1, a price that’s sure to shrink.</p>
