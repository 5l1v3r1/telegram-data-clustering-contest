New rewards, perks, and features have been added to a number of credit cards to make them even more enticing and earn you more cash or points on the purchases that you care about the most. We've seen huge upgrades to existing cards that earn exciting new rewards in growing spending categories, and the most successful credit card launch in history. There are also some incredible cards out there for traveling, for earning cash back, for small businesses, and for taking advantage of huge welcome bonuses and other introductory offers. After a year of reporting on all of the newest cards, the newest bonuses, and the newest updates, these credit cards have earned the title as being the best in their category in 2019.</p>

      <p>Apple Card may have only been released in the back half of the year, but it quickly took its place as the breakout credit card of the year with ease. Despite some of the controversy surround Goldman Sach's approval process and some bumpy bugs and odd user experiences after its rollout, it is undeniable that Apple Card revolutionizes the credit card experience in a number of important ways.</p>
      <p>With it's ridiculously easy to earn rewards program, Daily Cash, you get your rewards deposited the day after the purchase posts into your Apple Pay Cash Card which you can use to send friends money, transfer to your bank, or even pay your bill. The Wallet app automatically tracks your spending and displays all of this information to you in beautiful, easy to understand summaries to educate you on your spending habits and promote better financial decisions. It even shows you in real-time how much interest you'll be charged if you don't pay the full amount due on the card, and encourage you to increase the payment, showing you the effect it will have in lowering your interest charged.</p>
      <p>Apple Card is also the most private card in the industry. Apple will never know how much you spend, where you spend it, or what you spend it on. Its partner on the card, Goldman Sachs, has also promised not to share any of your information with advertisers.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Daily Cash</li>
        <li>Money management features</li>

      <p>That said, if you are looking to earn in specific categories like spending on your staples, catching the next flight, or collapsing into a bed at your hotel, there are much better cards made to make the most out of those specific needs. Figure out where you spend and where you want to earn, and choose the best card for you.</p>
