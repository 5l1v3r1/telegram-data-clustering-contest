      <p>Today members of Mthwakazi Republic Party protested at Ok Supermarket in Bulawayo's Lobhengula street, following the company's failer to respond to the letter previously written by the party's Bulawayo provincial executive and the subsequent meeting between the people's revolutionary party's leadership and OK Zimbabwe management at EGodini in Bulawayo.<br/><br/>The company is accused of employing only people from Mashonaland at the expense of locals. The party's Bulawayo leadership had done all the necessary diplomatic engagements to no avail forcing the members to demonstrate today.<br/><br/>The unemployed Bulawayo youths have since pledged to join the people's revolutionary party in a massive demonstration in Bulawayo as part of a broader strategy to push the government to reverse the deliberate marginalization of our people by both the government and the private sector.<br/><br/>We hope to see a change in the manner which people are employed in Matabeleland nothing for us without us.<br/><br/>Local jobs for local people<br/><br/>We support and appreciate the efforts being made by MRP pursuant to a just, fair and equitable distribution of national resources. We demand the immediate implementation of Devolution of power.</p>
