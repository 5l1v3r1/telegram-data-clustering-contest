      <p>The Santa Barbara City Council has asked a local developer to revise their plans for a proposed three-story hotel on W. Montecito Street.</p>
      <p>Developer and owner Ed St. George submitted a proposal to tear down the existing apartments at 302 and 308 W. Montecito Street for a 32-room hotel and coffee shop. St. George also proposed a three-story parking stacker system 33 vehicles and an additional five parking spaces.</p>
      <p>The report indicates the first level of the hotel would include the office, lobby, coffee shop, outdoor patio, and parking garage. The second level would include 15 hotel rooms and a lounge while the third level would include 17 rooms and a patio lounge. A roof deck would also be included.</p>
      <p>The City Planning Commission denied the project stating they preferred housing as opposed to a hotel since the city's goals are to create more affordable housing instead of removing it.</p>
      <p>St. George appealed to the City Council on Tuesday evening he argued the area is better suited for a hotel than residential housing. The site is across the street from the Neighborhood Bar &amp; Grill, Rudy's Tacos, and a self serve car wash.Â </p>
      <p>Councilmembers asked for an updated plan by December 17 that addresses the loss of housing, modify the architecture, as well as the size and scale of the building.</p>
