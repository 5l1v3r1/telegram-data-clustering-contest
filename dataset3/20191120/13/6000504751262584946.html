        <b>Toronto-based online brokerage Questrade is applying for a federal banking licence, paving the way for it to open an online bank.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a move first picked up by the <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/online-brokerage-questrade-now-eyeing-federal-banking-licence">Financial Post</a>, Questrade has given notice of a plan to file an application to the federal government for a "letters patent" that would incorporate "Quest Bank".<br/><br/>The firm has already filed a trademark application for Quest Bank, opening up the possibility of a move into a host of financial services, such as investment banking, insurance and a credit card loyalty programme.<br/><br/>Launched in 1999, Questrade offers online investing services, but is facing increased competition from US firms and fintech startups with low commission rates.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, the company gave a hint of its diversification plans when it bought Community Trust Co, which can take deposits and make loans.</p>
