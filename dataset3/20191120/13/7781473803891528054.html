      <p>Hyundai Aura is the name of the upcoming sedan from the Korean manufacturer which we believe is a <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/hyundai/grand-i10-m248/">Hyundai Grand i10</a> Nios based compact sedan. Earlier this month, Hyundai revealed the name of the upcoming sedan, and this time around the manufacturer has unveiled its drivetrain options. The Hyundai Aura will be offered with three different BSVI engines along with with a choice of a five-speed manual gearbox and a five-speed AMT (Automatic).</p>
