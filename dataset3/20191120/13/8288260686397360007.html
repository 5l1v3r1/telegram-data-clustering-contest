      <p>Police investigating the deaths of a man and woman believe he stabbed her to death before killing himself.</p>
      <p>The bodies of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/couple-found-dead-moseley-flat-17277657">Michael Tesfamariam and Tsegereda Gebremariam</a> , both 28, were discovered at an address on Oxford Road, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/moseley">Moseley</a> , on November 9.</p>
      <p>Police officers, alerted by a concerned man who 'heard screams', forced their way in and discovered Mr Tesfamariam hanged, an opening inquest at <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/courts">Birmingham Coroner's Court</a> heard.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gebremariam was found with stab wounds to her chest and stomach.</p>
      <p>Despite the efforts of police and paramedics, the pair - originally from Eritrea - both died at the scene.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Coroner Louise Hunt heard brief evidence from police officers, who said they did not believe anyone else had been involved in the deaths.</p>
      <p>The pair had lived at separate addresses, with Mr Tesfamariam a married delivery driver, living in Sycamore Road, Handsworth.</p>
      <p>Mrs Gebremariam was married to a warehouse worker and lived in Oxford Road.</p>

      <p>"They found Mr Tesfamariam, who had hanged himself.</p>

      <p>"Extensive efforts were made to save both of their lives, but they were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>"It is our hypothesis that Mr Tesfamariam stabbed Mrs Gebremariam, then killed himself."</p>
      <p>Full inquests into both of the deaths will be heard separately on April 6 next year.</p>
      <p>Ms Hunt will hear evidence from GPs, mental health services, forensic pathologists and witnesses.</p>
      <p>The news of the double deaths sent shockwaves through the  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/man-stabbed-death-lozells-murder-17272242">vibrant local community</a>  .</p>
      <p>Coun Kerry Jenkins (Lab, Moseley) said: “It is terrible to have had something like this happen in our community.</p>
      <p>“To have the deaths of two people like this is awful and there will be a lot of people who are shocked and saddened by this news.”</p>
      <p>The property on Oxford Road is said to have been converted into flats and is directly opposite a city primary school.</p>
