      <h2>A handy device that always keeps your glass full</h2>

      <p>The closer it gets to the festive season means it's time to crack open the booze.</p>
      <p>And now a retailer has launched a Christmas stocking that lets you fill it with two litres worth of wine - plenty to last you through the festive month. Or not.</p>
      <p>Ideal for keeping your guests glasses topped up over Christmas lunch, the Stocking Wine Dispenser is one of Amazon's best sellers this holiday season - and for good reason, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/amazon-selling-boozy-christmas-stocking-20920776">reports the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Costing just £9.95 with free delivery, it comes in a festive red and white colour, emblazoned with the words "We Wish You A Merry Christmas And A Happy Hangover".</p>
      <p>The only downside to the unique drinks dispenser is that will need to buy the wine to fill it with separately.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/tesco">Tesco currently has 25% off</a> when you buy six bottles or more, while <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/waitrose">Waitrose has 25% off single bottles.</a></p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the internet, the same Stocking Wine Dispensers will set you back twice the price on eBay, at over £20 for almost exactly the same design.</p>
      <p>Back on Amazon, the stocking wine dispenser boasts some pretty happy reviews, with one customer saying "Perfect gift for the wino that has everything!", while another added "I bought it for my girlfriend for our Christmas Day party at her house. Worked great and great conversation piece".</p>
      <p>Whether you're looking for something different for the friend that has everything, or just want the perfect jokey gift for secret santa, you surely can't go wrong with a stocking wine dispenser...</p>
