      <p><b>New Delhi</b><b>: </b>Over three months after the Centre abrogated Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) took possession of seven properties attached in connection with its probe into a terror-funding case involving Hizb-u Mujahideen (HuM) chief Syed Salahuddin and others. A senior ED official said all the seven properties were attached by the financial probe agency earlier in the case.</p>
      <p>“But this is for the first time that we took possession of the properties in the Valley,” he said, adding “earlier we had to rely on other agencies to take possession”. He said the said properties are located in Anantnag, Sopore, and Bandipora.</p>
      <p>The official said the seven properties were earlier provisionally attached. “After confirmation of the orders by the competent authority, ED officials visited the places and put up notices declaring the agency has taken over physical possession of the parcels of land,” he said.</p>
      <p>According to senior ED officials, the Central probe agency has issued orders for attachment of 13 properties belonging to Mohammad Shafi Shah and six others of the HuM under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. “The action was taken on the basis of a charge sheet filed by the National Investigation Agency against them,” he said.   He said it became possible to take possession only after Article 370 was abrogated. The Central government had abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir on August 5.</p>
      <p>According to the National Investigation Agency and ED, the HuM had been raising money through the Jammu and Kashmir Affectees Relief Trust in collusion with Pakistan-based entities to fund terror activities in the Valley.</p>
      <p>The ED alleged the funds were sent to India through the ‘hawala’ channel, barter trade and human carriers and also distributed among the kin of terrorists, dead or alive.  (IANS)</p>
