      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 20): Lower expenses and higher other income helped boost KESM Industries Bhd’s net profit to RM4.53 million or 10.53 sen a share for the first quarter ended Oct 31, 2019 (1QFY20), a whopping 71.45% more than the RM2.64 million or 6.14 sen a share for the same period last year.</p>
      <p>This was inspite of a 11.24% decline in revenue to RM72.39 million, from RM81.56 million before, owing to lower demand for burn-in, testing and electronic manufacturing services (EMS), according to the company’s filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>KESM said it continues to focus on improving factory productivity, automation and aligning capacity to progressive increase in demand, amidst hopes for an improved US-China trade agreement.</p>
