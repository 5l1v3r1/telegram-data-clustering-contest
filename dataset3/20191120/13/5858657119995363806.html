      <p>Not signalling tops the list of bad driving behaviours in a new survey</p>

      <p>VANCOUVER (NEWS 1130) – Canadians are getting worse at driving – at least that’s what more than half of people are saying in a new survey.</p>
      <p>What’s the biggest problem on the roads?</p>
      <p>A recent poll from Research Co. suggests drivers not using their signal when turning is topping the list of regrettable behaviour behind the wheel. Three-in-five Canadians (61 per cent) say they’ve seen someone turn without using their signal over the past month, down 10 points from last year.</p>

      <p>Cars taking up more than one space in the parking lot was another bad behaviour noticed by nearly half (47 per cent) of people surveyed, and 44 per cent said they saw vehicles not stopping at an intersection.</p>
      <p>Last year, the number was about 10 points higher, so it appears some progress is being made.</p>
      <p>“This year’s survey shows some improvement, as fewer Canadians are reporting regrettable behaviour from drivers on the road,” says Mario Canseco, President of Research Co in a news release. “The proportion of respondents across the country who did not experience any problems increased from 16% in 2018 to 21% this year.”</p>
      <p>Overall, just under half of those surveyed think drivers in their city or town are worse than they were five years ago, about 40 per cent believe they are the same.</p>
      <p>Another third said they came close to a crash on the road, either having to slam on their brakes or swerve to avoid a collision.</p>
      <p>More than half of Ontarians (52 per cent) and Albertans (65 per cent) say drivers have become worse. British Columbians complained about this most last year (64 per cent), but it seems fewer people feel this way in 2019 (48 per cent).</p>
      <p>The majority of Canadians (56 per cent) blame specific groups of people for being worse drivers than others. That sentiment is highest in Alberta (65 per cent), B.C. (59 per cent) and Ontario (59 per cent).</p>
      <p><a href="https://researchco.ca/2019/11/20/drivers-canada/">Results are from an online survey</a> of 1,000 Canadians from Nov. 4 to Nov. 6. Data was statistically weighted according to the Canadian census by age, gender and region. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 points, 19 times out of 20.</p>
