      <h1>Parents threaten to withhold fees after Merchant Taylors' School announces merger plans</h1>
      <h2>But the school says the decision will "enhance the quality of teaching and learning"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:37:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/max-clements/" target="_blank">Max Clements</a></address>
      <p>Angry parents said they have been "left in the dark" after <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merchant-taylors-boys-school">Merchant Taylors' School</a> announced plans to merge its two junior and infant schools.</p>
      <p>On Monday night the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crosby">Crosby</a> independent school sent an email to parents informing them that the Junior Boys school, currently based at the Liverpool Road site, is set to closed as part of an overhaul of the school's primary education.Â </p>
      <p>Under the plans, the Junior Boys school, which currently teaches pupils aged 7-11, will move to the school's Stanfield site which houses the infant school and the girls junior school.</p>
      <p>The plan will see the boys and girls junior schools and the mixed infant school all merge together - meaning that all boys and girls at the school aged 4 to 11 will be taught together.</p>
      <p>The announcement has prompted a significant backlash from parents at the school who are believed to be threatening to withhold fees if the plan goes ahead.</p>
      <p>In a letter sent to parents, seen by the ECHO, the Chair of Governors Beverley Bell CBE wrote that the decision was taken to "enhance the quality of teaching and learning" and that it was taken "purely on educational grounds".</p>

      <p>The letter states that the decision to merge the schools together came following "a full review of our current primary education provision" and that the new co-educational primary school will be called "Stanfield, Merchant Taylors'".</p>
      <p>The school says the decision is motivated by the desire to extend co-education and mixed schooling, through the entire school to all students aged 4-11.</p>
      <p>The merger is expected to be completed in September 2022, making the entire school co-educational from reception to year 6.</p>
      <p>The ECHO understands that angry parents are set to confront senior staff and governors at a consultation meeting scheduled for this evening.</p>
      <p>One parent said that there had been no consultation at all over the merger and that she felt "cheated" and "left in the dark" over her child's education.</p>
      <p>She told the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> : "The parents think that the school is using bullying tactics. We haven't been consulted over this decision at all.</p>
      <p>"We haven't even been asked about it. We were all sent an email announcing the decision.</p>
      <p>"I think it will have a massively detrimental effect on the children.</p>
      <p>"Essentially they'll be sending the junior boys back to the site where they went to the infant school. They're sending them back to baby school."</p>
      <p>The mum said she is also concerned over the lack of facilities on the site.</p>
      <p>She added: "The Stanfield site does not have the same facilities as the current school which has a Rugby pitch, an astro turf. At Stanfield they only have a playground.</p>

      <p>"There is something that the school is not telling us. I doubt the real reason for this is to do with making the school co-educational.</p>
      <p>"I've been told that teachers at Stanfield and at the boys Junior were not told about the merger and that they found out with the parents.</p>
      <p>"I feel angry and upset. If this goes ahead we will go on strike and withhold paying our fees.</p>
      <p>"We just feel like we have been cheated and it's has been done in a way that's so sly. I want to know how long have meetings been taking place over this?</p>
      <p>"As a parent I feel like I have been completely kept in the dark over these plans ."</p>
      <h3>School's statement in full:</h3>
      <p>In a statement, Beverley Bell CBE, Chair of Governors at Merchant Taylors' School said: "We can confirm that, following a full review of our current primary education provision, the Board of Governors has decided that our boys and girls aged 4 to 11 will be in the future be educated together at our Primary School Site at Stanfield, Crosby.</p>

      <p>"We have made this decision as we want to further enhance the quality of the teaching and learning of our girls and boys as well as their overall school experience.</p>
      <p>"We also took account of our market research, and the fact that many parents have expressed a desire for their children to mix with both boys and girls whilst at the primary school.</p>
      <p>"We know that many parents choose our wonderful schools for the excellent education and care their children receive at Merchant Taylors'. rather than because we offer single sex education at ages 7 to 11.</p>
      <p>"The move of our junior boys to Stanfield will also ensure better utilisation of the Stanfield building, which has benefited from considerable investment in recent years. Indeed we see the provision of co-education until age 11 as a natural progression of our co-education from ages 4-7.</p>
      <p>"We intend to recruit a Headteacher and a Deputy Head to lead Stanfield and we look forward to receiving applications for these prestigious posts from both internal and external candidates to lead us through this transition and to further develop the school.</p>
      <p>"The Board of Governors sees the new co-educational Stanfield, Merchant Taylors' as an exciting development in our long history as we move towards celebrating our 400h anniversary."</p>
