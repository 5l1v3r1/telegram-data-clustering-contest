      <h1>France and Italy warned by Brussels over high debt levels</h1>
      <h2>Spending plans risk breaching EU rules, says European Commission</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:27:02+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Dombey, Mehreen Khan</a></address>
      <p>Brussels has warned France and Italy that they are running stubbornly high levels of public debt, meaning their future budgets risk breaching EU rules and alarming investors.</p>
      <p>The European Commission on Wednesday published its opinion on the 2020 draft spending plans of all eurozone member states. It had harsh words for Paris, Rome and Madrid which, it said, had failed to make use of good economic times to chip away at their debt burdens. </p>
      <p>Valdis Dombrovskis, commission vice-president in charge of the euro, said France, Italy and Spain — as well as Belgium — were “not expected” to meet the EU’s debt reduction targets for next year. </p>
      <p>“In 2020, they plan either no meaningful fiscal adjustment or even a fiscal expansion,” said Mr Dombrovskis. “This is worrying because very high debt levels limit the capacity to respond to economic shocks and market pressures.” </p>
      <p>The four governments were “not taking sufficient advantage of recent declines in interest expenditure in order to reduce their debt ratios”, the commission said.</p>
      <p>“Failure to reduce public debt may increase the risk of heightened market pressure on countries with high public debt in the future, which could have negative spillover effects on the public debt markets of other euro-area member states,” said the commission’s assessment. </p>
      <p>The debt warning is particularly acute for France and Italy — the eurozone’s second- and third-largest economies; Brussels also gave notice to the caretaker administration in Spain, although it is waiting for a new government in Madrid to put together a budget before making a final judgment.</p>
      <p>Last month, Brussels wrote to Italy’s centre-left/Five Star coalition and Emmanuel Macron’s government in France saying that their 2020 spending plans risked “significant deviation” from EU rules. </p>
      <p>The commission’s loudest note of alarm was provoked by Italy’s forecast 136 per cent debt to gross domestic product ratio. Brussels warned that “the short term sustainability of Italian public finances appears vulnerable to increases in the cost of debt issuance”. </p>
      <p>Rome’s coalition government has promised to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5866cba-efe4-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">keep its deficit broadly stable</a> and implement tax cuts for the lowest earners in its mildly expansionary budget. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, France is on course to be the only eurozone economy in breach of the EU’s deficit ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP this year, although it is set to comply with the rule by 2020.</p>
      <p>Bruno Le Maire, France’s economy minister, has vowed to hold firm to his draft budget, which will cut taxes and raise spending, calling it a “political choice” designed to counteract the slowing global economy. France’s debt burden is forecast to rise from 98.8 per cent of GDP next year to 99.2 per cent in 2021.</p>
      <p>While the commission told highly indebted countries to be fiscally “prudent”, it also urged richer member states with lower debt burdens to embark on a significant spending push to help lift the eurozone out of its economic slowdown. Brussels offered qualified praise for the Netherlands and Germany, which will increase public spending in 2020, but insisted they could still do more.</p>
      <p>“Member states with fiscal space are implementing expansionary fiscal policies and should stand ready to continue the use of their fiscal space,” said the commission.</p>
      <p>The commission asked Spain and Belgium to submit fresh budgets as soon as their new governments are in place.</p>

      <p>The debt warning is a headache for Spain’s ruling Socialist party, which campaigned in this month’s general election to increase spending and is seeking to form a coalition with the radical left Podemos, which wants to raise expenditure further. Their plans contrast with the commission’s call for Spain’s net primary government expenditure to increase by no more than 0.9 per cent in 2020. </p>
      <p>The Spanish authorities insist that as soon as a new government is in place, they will present a draft 2020 budget combining fiscal discipline with economic growth, job creation and structural reforms. However, any parliamentary vote on the new coalition is unlikely to take place before mid-December.</p>
