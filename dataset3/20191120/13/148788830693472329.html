      <p>Next up, a new edition of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stznrpS3_Gc&amp;feature=emb_title">Vox Almanac</a> takes a look at the history of movies and their gradual increase from 15 minute stories to the much longer two-hour and three-hour movies we more commonly get today. An Italian epic called Quo Vadis started the long movie trend back in 1913 by clocking in at two hours. It had huge stunts, thousands of extras, real Roman locations, and it would change movies forever.</p>
