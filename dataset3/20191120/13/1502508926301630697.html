      <p>The Constitution accords equal importance to all the languages of the country and there is no proposal for "one nation, one language", the government informed Parliament on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy was replying to a written question in Rajya Sabha whether there is a proposal to have a single language for the country.</p>
      <p>"There is no proposal for one nation-one language," Reddy said.</p>
      <p>The minister's reply comes in the backdrop of protest by leaders of several non-Hindi speaking states and pro-Kannada organisations, who had taken to the streets in September after Union Home Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-amit-shah">Amit Shah </a>propopsal spoke of 'One Nation, One Language'.</p>
      <p>The minister further said that the "Constitution accords equal importance to all the languages of the country."<br/><br/>"Language matters are in the concurrent list of the Constitution of India and are within the executive spheres of the central government and the respective state governments," he said.</p>
      <p>He added that grants are not released language-wise by the Ministry of Human Resource Development.</p>
      <p>In reply to an another question, the minister said the incidents of communal violence, in the last three years, have shown a "declining trend" in the country.</p>
      <p>However, no data was furnished in the reply.</p>
      <p>To another question on the number of sedition cases filed against persons who criticised and doubted surgical strikes conducted by the Army, Reddy said "no such data" is available with the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">National </a>Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) as on date.</p>
