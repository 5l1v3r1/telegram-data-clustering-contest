      <p><b>THE HAGUE - </b>A ferry crew found 25 migrants in a refrigerated container on a boat sailing from the Netherlands to Britain on Tuesday, emergency services said.<br/><br/>The cargo vessel bound for Felixstowe returned to the Dutch port of Vlaardingen, near Rotterdam, as soon as the stowaways were found, they said in a statement.<br/><br/>The people found in the container received medical attention at the port and two were taken to hospital for further treatment for possible hypothermia.<br/><br/>The discovery comes the month after 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain, again laying bare the risks of illegal migrant routes to Europe.<br/><br/>"On board a ship it turned out that several people were found in a cooling container. The ship returned to the harbor," said the Rotterdam region emergency services on Twitter.<br/><br/>"The 25 people were taken off the ship and given the medical care they need. Earlier the message came from the ship that no people died.<br/><br/>"Two people were transported to hospital for extra medical care. Twenty-three people were transferred to a police location after a medical check-up."<br/><br/>DFDS Seaways, which operates the cargo ferry, said that the migrants had come on board on a lorry trailer, De Telegraaf newspaper said.<br/><br/>The driver of the truck had been arrested, it added.<br/><br/>A bus took away the mainly male group, some of whom were wrapped in silver thermal blankets.<br/><br/>Their nationalities were not immediately known.<br/><br/>The mayor of Vlaardingen, Annemiek Jetten, said "more and more" people were trying to cross the Channel and had not been put off by the deaths of the Vietnamese migrants.<br/><br/>"I think people are so desperate that they keep trying, despite the tragic events in the UK not so long ago," Jetten told broadcaster NOS.<br/><br/>She added that it was not clear if more people were trying to get to Britain before immigration laws become tougher after its scheduled exit from the EU next year.<br/><br/>Separately on Tuesday Dutch border police intercepted a bus carrying 65 Moldovan nationals including children who were planning to claim asylum, Dutch media reported. -AFP</p>
