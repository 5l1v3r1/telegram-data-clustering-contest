      <p>The Reserve Bank of India has superceded the board of troubled mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) and has appointed an administrator.</p>
      <p>The banking regulator further said insolvency proceedings will be intimated against the company.</p>
      <p>This will be the first case of insolvency proceedings against a financial sector entity after norms were modified to allow such action.</p>
      <p>RBI said the actions were taken due to governance concerns and defaults by DHFL in meeting various payment obligations.</p>
      <p>R. Subramaniakumar, ex-MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank has been appointed as the administrator.</p>
