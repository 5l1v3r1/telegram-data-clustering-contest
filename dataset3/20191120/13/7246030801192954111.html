      <p>Less than 11 hours short of the expiration of Blue&amp;White chairman Benny Gantz’s mandate from the president to assemble a coalition government, Israel Beiteinu chairman Avigdor Liberman told a press conference on Wednesday that there is no chance of him joining a narrow rightwing government or a leftwing minority government.</p>
      <p>“It was clear that we would not go to a coalition supported by the joint list,” he stated, adding that he had done everything to bring about a unity government.</p>
      <p>He attacked Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as Blue&amp;White chairman Benni Gantz for not willing to compromise. He accused Gantz of not accepting the president’s outline, which gave Netanyahu the first stint in a rotation-based government, and blamed Netanyahu who “was not ready to part with his Haredi-Messianist bloc.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, Liberman made it clear that if the two big parties did not reach a unanimous agreement on a unity coalition by noon Wednesday, it would be “every man for himself.”</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, Netanyahu enslaves the entire Likud movement to the Haredi parties,” Liberman said, but reiterated that both Likud and Blue&amp;White were responsible for the situation.</p>
      <p>According to Liberman, Netanyahu had been playing for time in the negotiations, while Blue&amp;White were pulling a double-crossing game. They pretended to be interested in following the president’s recommendation for a rotation government, but ignored Rivlin’s suggestion that Netanyahu go first. He also accused Gantz of trying to build a coalition government with the Haredim.</p>
      <p>Liberman said he made “every effort to reach a liberal unity government as we promised the voter.”</p>
      <p>He said he received very tempting offers in return for agreeing to join the government, including the post of deputy prime minister and a place as Prime Minister on the rotation in the coalition’s last year. He insisted that he did not intend to betray his principles, that is a broad liberal unity government that will pass a series of laws aimed to reduce the influence of the Haredi parties in Israel.</p>
      <p>“We don’t sell out our principles, even for seats,” he said.</p>
      <p>He called on the Zionist parties to sign a joint covenant that would define the relationship between religion and the state in Israel.</p>
      <p>He also enthusiastically supported separate personal elections for the prime minister, but stressed that one does not change the rules in mid-game and those changes will have to wait.</p>
