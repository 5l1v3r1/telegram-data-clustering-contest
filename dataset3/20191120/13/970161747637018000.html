      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> have stepped up their interest in Erling Haaland after inviting the striker’s father to visit their training ground, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old is set to be one of the most in-demand players in the January transfer window as several clubs are monitoring his progress at Red Bull Salzburg.</p>
      <p>Haaland has been in sublime form this season having scored 26 goals in 18 appearances and his performances have attracted interest from a host of top European clubs including <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a> and Bayern Munich.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are also in the race to sign Haaland <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/erling-haalands-father-visits-carrington-amid-manchester-united-transfer-speculation-11176147/">with reports claiming earlier this week that the player’s father, Alf-Inge, has been given a tour of the club’s Carrington training complex</a>.</p>

      <p>But according to Sport Bild, United are not the only Premier League team to have extended a similar invite as Alf-Inge has also paid a visit to Arsenal’s training facilities at London Colney.</p>

      <p>The report also claims that Arsenal are ‘as interested’ as United in signing Haaland.</p>
      <p>However, the report also claims that Alf-Inge <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/erling-haalands-father-visits-carrington-amid-manchester-united-transfer-speculation-11176147/">is advising is son to join a team in the Bundesliga before making the jump to the Premier League or La Liga</a>.</p>
      <p>United, meanwhile, could have the upper hand over the Gunners given that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has already worked with Haaland during their time together at Molde.</p>
      <p>Last week, reports claimed that Solskjaer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-instructs-manchester-united-sign-erling-braut-haaland-11124099/">has instructed United’s hierarchy to attempt to secure a deal for Haaland in the January transfer window</a>.</p>
