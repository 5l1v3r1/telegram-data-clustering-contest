      <p>Shares of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tgt-stock">Target</a> surged as much as 12% in early trading Wednesday after the company reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.</p>
      <p>Here’s what the company reported versus what analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Adjusted earnings per share:</b> $1.36 reported, versus $1.19 (expected)</li>
        <li><b>Revenue:</b> $18.67 billion reported, versus $18.22 billion (expected)</li>
        <li><b>Comparable sales:</b> +4.5% reported, versus +3.5% (expected)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The company also raised its full-year profit guidance. Target now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to fall between $6.25 and $6.45 per share, up from its previous guidance of $5.90 to $6.20 per share. Analysts had expected earnings between $6.05 and $6.40 per share.</p>
      <p>“Our third quarter results are further proof of the durability of our strategy, as we’re seeing industry-leading strength across multiple metrics, from the top line to the bottom line,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said <a href="https://investors.target.com/news-releases/news-release-details/target-reports-third-quarter-2019-earnings">in a press release</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s also evidence that investments Target has made in updating stores, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mini-disney-stores-in-target-2019-8">opening 25 mini-stores</a> with Disney in October, have paid off. The company also expanded its grocery options this year with the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/target-launches-food-brand-as-it-doubles-down-on-grocery-2019-8">launch of its brand, Good &amp; Gather</a>. And, Target made improvements to its online experience and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/target-same-day-shipping-grows-website-2019-6">added same-day shipping through its website</a>.</p>
      <p>The earnings beat comes amid disappointing reports from department stores such as <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/kohls-stock-price-earnings-q3-slowing-growth-profit-guidance-cut-2019-11-1028700307">Kohl’s</a> and <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jcpenney-stock-gains-after-q3-earnings-shows-smaller-loss-than-expected-2019-11-1028693378">JCPenney,</a> which disclosed earnings earlier this week. Target’s big-box rival, Walmart, also reported an earnings beat last week, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/walmart-stock-gains-on-strong-third-quarter-earnings-report-2019-11-1028689455">sending shares to a 52-week high</a>.</p>
      <p>Target is up <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tgt-stock">82% year to date</a>.</p>
