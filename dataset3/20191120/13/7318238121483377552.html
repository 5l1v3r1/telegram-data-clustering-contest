      <p>A home in Brazil made of thousands of discarded bottles is proving quite the attraction in a rural area of Sao Paulo state.</p>
      <p>It's a labour of love for single mother Ivone Martins who took to building this house following the death of her son.</p>
      <p>The glass bottles are placed on their side and bound together with cement.</p>
      <p>Martins got the idea to build the house after seeing large quantities of dumped bottles in the area.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Reuters, the proud homeowner said her bottle house was not only good for cutting construction costs but was also helping the environment.</p>
      <p>At three metres high, nine metres wide and eight metres in length, Martin fashioned a bedroom, corridor, kitchen and a bathroom out of more than 6,000 bottles.</p>
      <p>But work on the home is not over, with Martins also thinking about how to incorporate other recycled materials to make furniture for the home.</p>
