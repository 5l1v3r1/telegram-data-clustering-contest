      <h1>Google’s Irish subsidiary posts $2.03bn profit</h1>
      <h2>Subsidiary paid €255m in tax on revenue from intellectual property royalty income</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:16:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/peter-hamilton-7.4048150" target="_blank">Peter Hamilton</a></address>
      <p>One of Google’s Irish subsidiaries posted a profit before tax of $2.03 billion (€1.83 billion) in 2018, a 45 per cent increase on the previous year , on turnover of $2.6 billion.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Google">Google</a> Europe International Technology Unlimited, which generates revenue from royalty income for selling intellectual property to other group companies, said its turnover rose by $634 million in the year.</p>
      <p>The company paid corporation tax of $255 million in the period, an effective rate which is slightly higher than the statutory rate of 12.5 per cent in the Republic.</p>
      <p>Those figures come after a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Department+of+Finance">Department of Finance</a> report last week noted that the Government has enjoyed a near €6 billion bounce in corporation tax receipts since 2014.</p>
      <p>The report also highlighted “the concentrated nature of revenues” with 80 per cent of last year’s €10.4 billion total coming from a relatively small cohort of mainly US multinationals in the pharmaceutical, technology and finance sectors . About 45 per cent of last year’s total came from just 10 companies, understood to include tech giants Google, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Apple">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Microsoft">Microsoft</a>, Dell and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Oracle">Oracle</a>.</p>
      <h3>Onshoring of assets</h3>
      <p>The jump in receipts has been linked to the onshoring of assets here in the wake of a global clampdown on multinational tax avoidance and increased corporate profitability generally.</p>
      <p>Google Europe International Technology reduced its intangible assets here during the year from $2.7 billion to $2.1 billion. Given the nature of the company’s business, this is all likely to be comprised of intellectual property.</p>
      <p>Also during the year, the company ultimately owned by the Nasdaq-listed Alphabet said it made “interim distributions” of $3.2 billion to one of its shareholders. And in March, the company made a further distribution of $534 million to one of its parent companies, Google Bermuda Limited.</p>
      <p>This entity doesn’t employ any staff while the directors behind it are supported by staff of other group undertakings.</p>
      <p>Fellow group companies owed the Irish-based entity $691 million during the year, while it owed $148 million to other group companies.</p>
