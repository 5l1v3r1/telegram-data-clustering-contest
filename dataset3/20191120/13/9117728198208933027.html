      <h1>James Allison frustrated with "miserable" race for Mercedes</h1>

        <b>James Allison was left disappointed for his first race in charge of the Mercedes team in Toto Wolff's absence, as the 2019 constructors' champions only managed to pick up a measly six points as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> received a penalty and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> retired.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The race was only the third time Mercedes failed to score a podium, although Hamilton did collect the P3 trophy before his penalty for hitting <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> was given.</p>

      <p>Wolff missed the race for the first time since 2013, giving Allison more responsibility. He told Autosport he enjoyed the new tasks, despite the poor result.</p>
      <p>He said: <i>“To be honest I have been doing the same thing I do when I’m here normally, just with a few extra things like this [media session].</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“But in terms of what I do here normally, which is just engage with the engineers and try to say helpful things here and there through the weekend, it’s been no different.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I’ve been here as a technical director and not a team principal. And Toto has been a team principal off doing other work, instead of here.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s hard to say that I haven’t enjoyed it. I always enjoy coming to the track. It’s just been miserable when we make a mess of a race.”</i>
