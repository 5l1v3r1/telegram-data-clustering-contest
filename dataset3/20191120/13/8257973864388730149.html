      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chadwick-Boseman/?tps=1">Chadwick Boseman</a> said on <i>The Tonight Show</i> that he first auditioned to play Drax in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> before he was selected to portray Black Panther.</p>
      <p>"I didn't think I was going to get it," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFPqBjh4G30">the actor told host</a> <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jimmy_Fallon/?tps=1">Jimmy Fallon</a> on Tuesday's show.</p>
      <p>"It's a testament to Marvel because after each film, <i>Ant-Man</i> has a different tone and feeling. We didn't know what that was going to be. We didn't know what <i>Guardians</i> was going to be," Boseman said.</p>
      <p>"So I didn't know what it was and I only had a few pages at that time. So it was just good to come in and play and to see what they did with it."</p>
      <p>The role of Drax was given to Dave Bautista with Boseman saying that his initial audition with Marvel led to him becoming Black Panther.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes that's the way it works as an actor," the 41-year-old said. "You're meeting the people that you know, they might be like, 'He's not this, but we'll put him in this other thing.'"</p>
      <p>Boseman will next be seen in police thriller <i>21 Bridges,</i> which hits theaters on Friday. He will be <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Movies/2019/08/25/Black-Panther-2-to-open-in-theaters-on-May-6-2022/9211566735479/">reprising his Marvel role</a> in <i>Black Panther 2</i>, set to open in theaters on May 6, 2022.</p>
