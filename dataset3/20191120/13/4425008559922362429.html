      <h1>NCI powers into global top 50 compute clusters</h1>
      <h2>Pawsey, cloud providers drop off the radar.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:35:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/matt-johnston-1224521" target="_blank">Matt Johnston</a></address>
      <p>The latest global ranking of high performance compute clusters is a mixed bag for Australia, saved by the National Computational Infrastructure’s (NCI) introduction of its new supercomputer.</p>
      <p>Phase one of NCI’s Gadi, which was made available for user testing on Monday, stormed into 47th place based on Teraflops (Tflop/s) - the ability to execute one million million (10<sup>12</sup>) floating-point operations per second.</p>
      <p>The Fujitsu-built cluster features 72,576 cores and has an Rmax of 4407.5 TFlop/s, with an Rpeak score of 7431.8 TFlop/s.</p>
      <p>When completed, the NCI hopes Gadi will be among the top 25 most powerful machines globally.</p>
      <p>The NCI’s ageing Raijin supercomputer was the next highest ranking Australian supercomputer, despite being slated for decommissioning in late January.</p>
      <p>Raijin is currently ranked 239th in world, <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/aussie-supercomputers-slide-down-global-rankings-527655">a slip of 66 places</a> from the June Top500.</p>
      <p>Australia’s other national HPC facility, the Pawsey Supercomputing Centre, has finally fallen out of the top 500 after only scraping into 454th position in the last listing. Pawsey was granted $70 million from the federal government in April 2018 to replace its Magnus supercomputer, and is currently seeking tenders for the new build.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, locally-based cloud providers have largely fallen out of the top 500 after making a <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/aussie-clouds-storm-into-top-500-compute-clusters-495482">sudden appearance</a> in last year’s lists.</p>
      <p>Of the three that debuted in 2018, only “Software Vendor (M)” remains, sitting in 249th spot with 57,600 cores. It’s a fall of 70 spaces compared to June’s list, and 144 spots since its debut in June last year.</p>
      <p>IBM's Summit and Sierra machines at the US Department of Energy once again took out spots one and two respectively, followed by The National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi, China.</p>
