      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/vasyl-lomachenko/">Vasyl Lomachenko</a> has denied he made a request to the WBC to become a ‘franchise’ champion.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainian talent was given the title in October by the WBC, which means he is not be subject to strict mandatory challengers obligations.</p>
      <p>It also means Lomachenko will be recognised as a WBC champion throughout his career in every fight and once he is retired he will be inducted as an ‘emeritus’ champion.</p>

      <p>The creation of the WBC’s ‘franchise’ champions has prompted a backlash from boxing fans and fighters and Lomachenko has now insisted he never asked for the title.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I read an interview with [WBC president] Mauricio Sulaiman, he said we filed a request to be awarded the ‘franchise’ title.</p>

      <p>‘I would like to make it clear I did not file anything and no-one asked for it. When I read that, I was very surprised.’</p>
      <p>Lomachenko’s confirmation as ‘franchise’ champion meant Devin Haney became the new WBC lightweight champion, a title he successfully defended against Alfredo Santiago earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Middleweight superstar <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/canelo-alvarez/">Canelo Alvarez</a> was the first to be made a ‘franchise’ champion, but heavyweight WBC belt holder <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/deontay-wilder/">Deontay Wilder</a> insists he would not accept the title.</p>

      <p>‘Many people ask me about the ‘franchise’ belt. I don’t know much about it,’ Wilder said.</p>
      <p>‘What I’m hearing, it allows you to stay a champion, you don’t have to fight mandatories and stuff like that. If that’s the case, I’m not interested.</p>
      <p>‘I want the mandatories. Guys work their way up, work hard to get to number two, and then become a mandatory.</p>
      <p>‘Why would you crown someone that doesn’t have to have mandatories?’</p>
