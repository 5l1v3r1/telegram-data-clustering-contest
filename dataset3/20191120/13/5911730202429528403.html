      <h1>Co-founder of Orlando Magic pushing to bring Major League Baseball to Orlando</h1>

      <p>The city of Orlando is home to an NBA team, an MLS team, an NWSL team and the NFL's Pro Bowl, but could the city soon have baseball too?</p>
      <p>At a press conference Wednesday morning, Orlando Magic co-founder Pat Williams unveiled his pitch for an expansion MLB team he wants to call the Orlando Dreamers.</p>
      <p>Williams reportedly called the MLB commissioner's office Wednesday and left a message about his plan.</p>

      <p>The station says it has learned the announcement will be a push for an expansion baseball team in central Florida.</p>
      <p>"Guys, the best spot for a baseball team is right here in Central Florida," Williams told WFTV.</p>
      <p>Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has also expressed support for a team to the station. He has said he would push for another downtown stadium.</p>
      <p>WFTV also clarified that WIlliams is not necessarily trying to lure the Tampa Bay Rays to Orlando.</p>
      <p>While the Rays have had ongoing talks about a split season in Montreal or moving the team's stadium, this push seems to be more about an expansion team.</p>
      <p>It's no secret the Rays and Miami Marlins have had attendance problems, but it remains to be seen how an Orlando MLB franchise would do.</p>
      <p>Williams said even if 2% of the region's tourists watch the games, the team would draw 1.6 million people per year. He said he thinks the team could eventually draw 3 million people per year.</p>
      <p>This year the Orlando Magic are 20th in the league in attendance.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay Rays released a statement of support for the Dreamers:</p>
      <p>“We are proud of our strong fan support in Orlando, and we’re pleased to see their enthusiasm about Major League Baseball.”</p>
