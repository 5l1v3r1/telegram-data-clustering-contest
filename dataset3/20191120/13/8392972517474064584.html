      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:27:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Rodrigues</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> actress and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a> star Jacqueline Jossa has revealed "it's too soon" for her character Lauren Branning to return to Albert Square.</p>
      <p>The actress, who played Lauren in the BBC soap from 2010 until 2018, is starring in the current series of I'm A Celeb <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-jacqueline-jossas-tears-despite-nailing-bushtucker-trial/">which has already seen her tackle her worst fears</a>.</p>
      <p>However, before she left for the jungle, the 27-year-old spoke to the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/">Daily Star</a> about a potential return to EastEnders.</p>

      <p>She told the publication: "I think the time would have to be right for EastEnders. The time isn't right yet for me.</p>
      <p>"It's too soon, I think, to be honest. I don't think Lauren Branning is missed necessarily."</p>
      <p>But Jacqueline did hint she'd like to do "something lighter".</p>
      <p>She said: "I just think it would be too soon. But yeah, I do want to maybe do something completely different."</p>

      <p>Jacqueline admitted: "I'd like to do a comedy."</p>
      <p>"Something a little bit lighter. I'd quite like to do a stage show or a musical or something that's going to throw me a little bit."</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two left EastEnders at the beginning of 2018 after Lauren's sister Abi passed away.</p>
      <p>Both Lauren and pregnant Abi fell off the roof of The Vic on Christmas Day 2017 trying to help their dad, Max, down.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Lauren survived the fall with just a fractured leg but Abi was declared brain stem dead.</p>
      <p>Abi's baby survived and was delivered, but soon Abi's family made the decision to have her life support machine turned off.</p>
      <p>Abi's daughter was also named Abi in memory of her mother.</p>
      <p>Lauren left Albert Square after her sister's funeral and now lives in New Zealand with her son Louis and Louis' dad Peter.</p>
