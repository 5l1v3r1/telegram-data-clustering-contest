      <p>BAGHDAD (AP) — Anti-government protesters blocked access to a second major commercial port in southern Iraq on Tuesday, as bridge closures effectively split the capital in half, causing citizens to rely on boats to reach the other side of the city.</p>
      <p>Since anti-government protests began Oct. 1, at least 320 people have been killed and thousands wounded in Baghdad and the mostly Shiite southern provinces. Demonstrators have taken to the streets by the tens of thousands over what they say is widespread corruption, lack of job opportunities and poor basic services, despite the country’s oil wealth.</p>

      <p>Security forces have used live ammunition, tear gas and stun guns to repel protesters, tactics that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday would be punished with sanctions.</p>
      <p>“We will not stand idle while the corrupt officials make the Iraqi people suffer. Today, I am affirming the United States will use our legal authorities to sanction corrupt individuals that are stealing Iraqis’ wealth and those killing and wounding peaceful protesters,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Like the Iraqi people taking to the streets today, our sanctions will not discriminate between religious sect or ethnicity,” he added. “They will simply target those who do wrong to the Iraqi people, no matter who they are.”</p>
      <p>More than a dozen protesters blocked the main entrance to Khor al-Zubair port, halting trade activity as oil tankers and other trucks carrying goods were unable to enter or leave. The port imports commercial goods and materials as well as refined oil products.</p>
      <p>Crude from Qayara oilfield in Ninewa province, in northern Iraq, is also exported from the port.</p>
      <p>Khor al-Zubair is the second-largest port in the country. Protesters burned tires and cut access to the main Gulf commercial port in Umm Qasr on Monday and continued to block roads Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Iraqi civilians are increasingly relying on boats to ferry them across the Tigris River as standoffs between demonstrators and Iraqi security forces on three key bridges has shut main thoroughfares connecting east and west Baghdad.</p>
      <p>The Jumhuriya, Sinak and Ahrar bridges, which have been partially occupied by protesters after days of deadly clashes, connect both sides of the city by passing over the Tigris River. The blockages have left Iraqis who must make the daily commute for work, school and other day-to-day activities with no choice but to rely on river boats.</p>
      <p>“After the bridges were cut, all the pressure is on us here,” said Hasan Lilo, a boat owner in the capital. “We offer a reasonable transportation means that helps the people.”</p>
