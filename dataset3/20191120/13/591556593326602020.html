      <p>Mozilla has doubled the payout across its bug bounty program and added new sites and services to the list in an attempt to attract more attention from the bug-hunting community.<br/><br/>The browser-maker said it has <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2019/11/19/updates-to-the-mozilla-web-security-bounty-program/">doubled all web payouts</a> for critical, core and other Mozilla sites as part of its web and services bug bounty program page. <br/><br/>Mozilla has also tripled payouts to $15,000 for remote code execution payouts on critical sites and is adding new sites to the program.<br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/10-tips-for-new-cybersecurity-pros-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>10 tips for new cybersecurity pros</b></a><b> (free PDF)</b><br/><br/>"As we are constantly improving the services behind Firefox, we also need to ensure that sites we consider critical to our mission get the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/web-bug-bounty/">appropriate attention</a> from the security community," Mozilla said.</p>
      <p>Over the last six months Mozilla has added increased the number of sites that qualify for its bug bounty program. New sites include: <a href="https://github.com/mozilla-services/autograph">Autograph</a>, a cryptographic signature service that signs Mozilla products; <a href="https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lando-user.html">Lando</a>, Mozilla's new automatic code-landing service; <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Phabricator">Phabricator</a>, a code management tool used for reviewing Firefox code changes; and the <a href="https://docs.taskcluster.net/docs">Taskcluster</a> task execution framework.<br/><br/>Mozilla has also extended the list of sites it considers to be core to include <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/09/25/introducing-firefox-monitor-helping-people-take-control-after-a-data-breach/">Firefox Monitor</a>, <a href="https://mozilla-l10n.github.io/localizer-documentation/">Localization</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/subhub">Payment Subscription</a>, <a href="https://private-network.firefox.com/">Firefox Private Network</a>, <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Applications/Ship_It">Ship It</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/speech-proxy">Speak To Me</a> -- Mozilla's speech recognition API.</p>
      <p>While doubling potential bug payouts may make a few more security experts run an eye over Mozilla's sites, it's far from the biggest spender: spotting a critical flaw in Microsoft's new <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-launches-bug-bounty-for-new-chromium-edge-browser-with-30000-top-reward/">Chromium-based Edge browser</a> could make you $30,000. </p>
