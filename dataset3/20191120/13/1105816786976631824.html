      <p><b>KARACHI/LAHORE: </b>A lot more than something has gone wrong with Coke Studio 12. After managing to resolve an almost irreconcilable copyrights matter with EMI Pakistan, Rohail Hyatt and the Coca Cola Company has landed in hot waters once again.</p>
      <p>Sanam Marvi’s first song for season 12 has been taken off YouTube days after it’s release. If you try to click on the video thumbnail available on <i>Coke Studio’s</i> older Twitter posts, you’ll get an automated response.”This video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Abida Parveen.” The video has also been removed from YouTube.</p>

      <p>While representatives of Coke Studio could not be reached for a comment on this possible infringement claim, Abida Parveen’s representative confirmed the news. ” Abida Parveen is travelling out of the country at the moment but the claim is true. Something in this sort was in the process,” a representative told <i>The Express Tribune</i> on behalf of the singer.</p>
      <p>It is pertinent to mention here that earlier this week Abrarul Haque’s <i>Billo</i> was also removed from YouTube. While Shuja Haider and Rachel Viccaji’s <i>Saiyaan</i> was also taken off YouTube briefly after a copyright strike by EMI Pakistan.</p>
