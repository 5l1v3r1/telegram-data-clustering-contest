      <h1>Michael O'Neill: 'NI need fully-fit squad to qualify for Euro 2020'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-oneill/"><b>Michael O'Neill</b></a> has warned that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/northern-ireland/"><b>Northern Ireland</b></a> must have their key players available next March if they are to get past Bosnia and Herzegovina in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a> qualifying play-offs.</h2>

      <p>An illness for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonny-evans/"><b>Jonny Evans</b></a> and injury to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamal-lewis/"><b>Jamal Lewis</b></a> left Northern Ireland short-handed against Germany in Frankfurt on Tuesday and it duly turned into a punishing night as they lost their final Group C fixture 6-1, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/serge-gnabry/"><b>Serge Gnabry</b></a> bagging a hat-trick for the hosts.</p>
      <p>While that was taking place, Wales' 2-0 win over Hungary confirmed Northern Ireland's remaining path to Euro 2020 will go through Bosnia.</p>
      <p>O'Neill will be grateful that nothing as difficult as a trip to Germany lies in store, but Bosnia beat Northern Ireland home and away in the Nations League last year and cannot be taken lightly.</p>
      <p>"If we have a full squad I believe we can beat Bosnia come March," said O'Neill, who plans to remain in charge for the fixture alongside his new duties as Stoke boss.</p>
      <p>"If we're five or six players down it's very difficult to progress to the finals, it's as simple as that.</p>
      <p>"We have a 25-man squad and we don't really have players outside of that.</p>
      <p>"To get past Bosnia we will have to keep (Edin) Dzeko and (Miralem) Pjanic quiet as they are key to their performance."</p>
      <p>Though Bosnia got the better of his side last year, O'Neill is confident a fully-fit Northern Ireland squad is much better equipped to deal with the threat this time around.</p>
      <p>They were picked off on the counter-attack in a 2-1 defeat at Windsor Park, despite dominating possession and creating a string of chances, while Northern Ireland hit the post three times in a 2-0 defeat in Sarajevo.</p>
      <p>Both matches came early in a process of O'Neill refreshing his squad following the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign and a transition to a more possession-based approach going forward.</p>
      <p>Since then the likes of Lewis and Bailey Peacock-Farrell have established themselves as key players and, after four straight losses in the Nations League, results improved considerably with four wins and a draw from their eight Euro 2020 qualifiers.</p>
      <p>Arguably the results do not tell the full story as they led against Holland in Rotterdam until the 80th minute and only lost to two stoppage-time goals, missed a penalty as the reverse fixture finished 0-0 in Belfast, and even had a brief early lead in Frankfurt thanks to Michael Smith's strike.</p>
      <p>"Overall this has been a good campaign for us," O'Neill said. "Thirteen points, there's no shame in that in a group with Germany and Holland. For many of our players this is their first campaign and they can only learn from nights like this.</p>
      <p>"The players will learn both from the Nations League campaign and this campaign and the new players we have introduced have certainly been developing.</p>
      <p>"But when you get to the play-off it's not about style of play, it's about getting through, it's as simple as that."</p>
