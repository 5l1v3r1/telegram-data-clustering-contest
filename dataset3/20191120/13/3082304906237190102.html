        <b>Stevenage claimed allegations of abuse from Mark Sampson had “no foundation”, but he has been charged by the Football Association.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former England Women’s manager Mark Sampson has been charged by the Football Association (FA) for allegedly using racist language.</p>
      <p>Sampson is now caretaker boss at League Two side Stevenage and is alleged to have breached FA Rule E3, relating to a comment that was “improper and/or abusive and/or insulting”.</p>
      <p>It is claimed to be an “aggravated breach”, meaning it referenced “ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality”.</p>
      <p>Stevenage undertook an internal investigation in September after “allegations of racially discriminatory language” were reported in the media.</p>
      <p>The club said the claims, purportedly made by a Stevenage coach dismissed by Sampson, had “no foundation”.</p>
      <p>However, following the FA’s own investigation, Sampson now has until December 6 to respond to the charge.</p>
      <p>The Welshman, who led England to the semi-finals of the 2015 Women’s World Cup, was sacked as the Lionesses boss in September 2017.</p>
      <p>The FA said it had made the decision after evidence emerged of “inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour” during his time with Bristol Academy.</p>
      <p>It insisted Sampson’s dismissal was not linked to allegations made by former England forward Eniola Aluko that there had been alleged discriminatory behaviour on the manager’s part.</p>
