      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/wales-football">Wales</a> hero <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AaronRamsey">Aaron Ramsey</a> admits he has unfinished business at the European Championship.</p>
      <p>Ramsey marked his first Wales start in more than a year by firing Ryan Giggs’ side to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> on Tuesday. The Juventus midfielder scored twice in the 2-0 victory over Hungary in Cardiff as Wales secured their Euros return after reaching the semi-finals in 2016.</p>
      <p>Ramsey’s performances won him a place in the official Euro 2016 team of the tournament, but his time in France ended on a sour note as missed the last-four defeat to Portugal through suspension.</p>
      <p>Asked if he has unfinished business with the Euros, Ramsey replied: “Yes. It was obviously a disappointing ending to the Euros for me by missing out on the semi-final.</p>
      <p>“Those things happen and now I have the opportunity to go out there and express myself again. Hopefully we can have another successful run like we did last time. We had the best time of our lives in France so we wanted to make sure we got there again. I missed a lot of this campaign but I’ve chipped in now and it’s worthwhile.”</p>
      <p>Wales’ only previous appearance at a major tournament before Euro 2016 came at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. They reached the quarter-finals before losing 1-0 to Brazil, the goal scored by a 17-year-old called Pele.</p>
      <p>Qualification for Euro 2016 under Chris Coleman was regularly described as a “once in a lifetime” experience, as over 30,000 Wales fans made their way to France and football fever gripped the nation. But euphoria was soon replaced by the more familiar feeling of despair as Wales missed out on the 2018 World Cup after losing a decisive qualifier against the Republic of Ireland in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>“To do back-to-back Euros is something special,” Ramsey said. “It was very disappointing not to make the World Cup. But we learned from the experience of that night to bring it back here, and to win in the manner that we did was a nice experience. To experience this again now is going to be some journey.”</p>

      <p>Ramsey had sat out Wales’ Euro 2020 qualifying campaign through injury until coming on as a second-half substitute during the 2-0 win in Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But his double moved him onto 16 goals for Wales, taking him past the great John Charles on his country’s all-time scoring list and into joint-seventh place.</p>
      <p>Wales are now set to be placed in either Group A or Group B at Euro 2020. With Italy being a host nation and playing in Group A, Ramsey could line up against some of his Juventus team-mates in Rome’s Stadio Olimpico.</p>
      <p>“I’m enjoying my time over there at the moment so that would be nice,” Ramsey said. “I haven’t even thought about where we are going to be playing yet. It’s about enjoying this now and then we will come to all of that over the next few weeks.”</p>
