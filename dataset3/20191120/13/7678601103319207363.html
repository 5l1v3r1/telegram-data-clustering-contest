        <b>Keep track of time</b>
      </p>
      <p>Life is far too valuable to make work your sole priority. The key to happiness is to find a balance in life, therefore it is important to make time for your own purposes as well.</p>
      <p>Use a scheduler or a digital calendar to keep track of how much time you spend in the office, how much work you do at home and how much time you have fully for yourself.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Separate home and office</b>
      </p>
      <p>When you’re out of the office, but the thought of work suddenly strikes you, that’s when you know that burnout might be coming.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t matter whether it’s the evening after work, on the weekend, or during vacation, it is important to disconnect from work in your personal time. Your phone does not need to be always on standby. </p>
      <p>Also, focusing on different aspects of your life can make you feel inspired and energized when you’re back in work mode.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>Vacations are always necessary</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not only do vacations help with productivity and creativity, they are also good for your mental health. </p>
      <p>Working through your vacation days might feel right for your career and dreams, however, it is equally as important to take a breather.</p>
      <p>Go on a relaxing trip, without the hassle of connecting flights and excessive planning. Even a short getaway nearby can go a long way toward helping you fight workplace burnout. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Change of scenery</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another alternative is to work remotely. This way you can breathe fresh air and enjoy the view without the fear of falling behind. </p>
      <p>Working away from the office is also proven to increase the productivity and overall work satisfaction necessary for a successful career. (vel/kes)</p>
