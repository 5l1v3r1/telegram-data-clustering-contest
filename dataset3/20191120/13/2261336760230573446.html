      <h1>Darren Till reveals he was ‘blind drunk’ calling out Yoel Romero after UFC 244 win</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Harry Davies</a></address>
      <p>Darren Till has revealed he called out Yoel Romero when he was ‘blind drunk’ after celebrating his UFC 244 win over Kelvin Gastelum.</p>
      <p>Till (18-2-1) made his UFC middleweight debut at UFC 244 when he defeated Gastelum by split decision in a somewhat uneventful fight. Regardless the win meant Till shot up to fifth in the middleweight rankings, and questions were already being asked to who the Liverpudlian would face next.</p>
      <p>Talking recently to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYnd41Pd5o">MMAUK</a>, Till told a funny story about how he called out Romero whilst out drinking with some friends at a bar in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>“I was blind drunk. Yes, so my friend opened up a great bar in Liverpool, we got invited to the opening and I was celebrating the win,” Till said. “I was with the guys and I said, I had a few beers and said, ‘watch this.’ So, I went onto Google, I’ll get an image of Yoel, cause he is a scary dude, I said I’ll post that. He was like really bro? I said why not, let’s start a little controversy. So, I tagged him let’s go and it just blew up.” (Transcription via <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/darren-till-says-he-called-out-yoel-romero-when-he-was-blind-drunk/">BJ Penn</a>)</p>
      <p>“I remember the next morning I woke up and my girl was sat on the couch, because I slept on the couch, and she was like you called Yoel out,” Till said. “So, I went onto Google and got the monkey eyes and told my guy to add when you wake up and realize you called out Yoel. Everyone knows when I’m going on a tirade on Twitter it is because I’m having a drink. It is never normal. I’m having fun.”</p>

      <p>Although a lot was made of a potential fight between Till and the former title challenger Romero, it’s unlikely the UFC is going to make the fight. Instead, Till and former champion Robert Whittaker have recently been <a href="https://twitter.com/robwhittakermma/status/1195145936009408512?s=20">exchanging words on Twitter</a> as the two seem keen to fight each other at UFC London in March of next year.</p>
