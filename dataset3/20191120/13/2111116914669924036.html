      <p>It has been over ten years since Android was first outed by Google, and back then it was hard to imagine the sheer number of apps we'd have today.</p>
      <p>There are apps for everything, and many of them are completely free, meaning you're just a few downloads away from supercharging your smartphone at no extra cost.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, the huge quantity of apps doesn't mean they're all quality - far from it in fact, and finding the good ones can be tough.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What's the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-phone"><u>best phone</u></a> of 2019?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are tools and techniques to help, with various lists in the Play Store providing you with Editor's Picks across a range of categories, new releases and even apps that are specifically recommended for you based on your previous installs.</p>
      <p>You can also hunt out apps that are similar to your favorites by searching for an app you have and seeing what else comes up.</p>
      <p>And checking out user reviews and ratings can save you from downloading a dud of an app.</p>
      <p>But even with all that, the sheer number of apps on Google Play means many of the best can often get lost, while weaker ones sometimes rise to the top.</p>
      <p>So to make sure you never install a duff app here's our selection of the best you should install right now - each one carefully chosen to ensure you'll have a whole suite of fun, engaging and, dammit, useful apps on your phone or tablet.</p>
      <p>We've sorted them into categories so you can more easily find what you're looking for. But make sure to check back every two weeks for out latest app selection, which you'll find below.</p>
      <h4>Best free Android app of the week</h4>
      <p>Every two weeks we add a new app to this list and you'll find the latest addition below.</p>

      <h4>Yahoo Mail</h4>
      <p><u>Yahoo Mail</u> is an email app but it doesn’t require you to use Yahoo’s email service, despite the name. In fact, you can link any other email account to it. If you link multiples you can easily keep them separate and even have different themes for each, and there’s plenty more here to help it stand head and shoulders above most other free email apps.</p>
      <p>A real highlight of Yahoo Mail is its filters, letting you just see emails from people (as opposed to companies), or just see mailing lists you’re subscribed to (allowing you to quickly unsubscribe with just one tap), or just see attachments, travel documents, receipts, and other things.</p>
      <p>Yahoo Mail also lets you add a PIN or fingerprint security and even customize what if any gesture controls you want active. So whatever you might think of Yahoo email, don’t overlook Yahoo Mail.</p>
