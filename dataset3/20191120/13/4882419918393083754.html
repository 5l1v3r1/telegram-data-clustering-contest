      <p>Former Spain coach Robert Moreno will publish, at some point on Wednesda, a statement offering his version of events after the RFEF rehired Luis Enrique in his role on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>SPORT have learned that he is ready to give a comment after not speaking following the win over Romania, because he was too emotional about his goodbye.</p>
      <p>Moreno then sent two lawyers to a meeting with the RFEF instead of attending himself, where they negotiated his exit package. RFEF chief Luis Rubiales and sporting director Jose Francisco Molina then spoke in a press conference, but Moreno was not present there either. Today we will get his version.</p>
