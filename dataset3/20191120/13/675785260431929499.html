      <p>A mum allegedly tied up while her two children were sexually abused thought they were all going to die, a court has heard today.</p>
      <p>The woman described how she had met alleged serial rapist Joseph McCann, 34, in a bar in Greater Manchester, on May 5.</p>
      <p>She claimed the pair got a taxi home together - with the mum thinking he was a friend of a man she already knew.</p>
      <p>In a taped interview played to the Old Bailey jury, she said: "It was so stupid - why would I do something like that.</p>
      <p>"I never even go out - and this happens."</p>
      <p>She said at her home they had taken cocaine and listened to music on her laptop before she went to bed in her room fully clothed.</p>
      <p>The mother said she was awoken by McCann allegedly standing in front of her grasping her 17-year-old daughter.</p>

      <p>"He had hold of her with the knife," she said, and could see that her daughter had blood on her face.</p>
      <p>The daughter told her: "You need to get up and do what he says."</p>
      <p>McCann had allegedly grabbed the biggest knife in the kitchen and was brandishing it at the mother and the teenager, the court heard.</p>
      <p>The woman claimed she was made to go into her 11 year-old son's room by McCann as he allegedly threatened to slit her throat.</p>
      <p>"Then he started cutting plugs off everything," she said.</p>
      <p>"He said 'if you carry on talking I will slit your throat'. I was not allowed to look at him. I was not allowed to move my head."</p>
      <p>The woman then demonstrated how she was allegedly trussed up on the bed with her hands tied behind her back and her legs bound together and made to lie there for more than two hours.</p>
      <p>From another bedroom she claimed she could hear her daughter shouting: "No, no."</p>
      <p>"I was just lying there. I could only here little bits in their bedroom," she wept.</p>

      <p>She added: "I'm not that kind of person. I feel like I am the bad one."</p>
      <p>in the police interview played to the jury, she asks the officer: "Am I."</p>
      <p>"No," the detective replied.</p>
      <p>The mother said at one point she saw her naked daughter pass by the open door.</p>
      <p>"I thought we were all going to die. He said to me if I moved anything, even if I moved my eyes he would slit my throat."</p>
      <p>She then heard running down the stairs.</p>
      <p>The daughter had jumped out of the window to escape and was being chased by McCann, the court heard.</p>

      <p>Her son, who was still in his pyjamas then came into the room to release her.</p>
      <p>He told her McCann had forced him to lie on the floor and ordered his sister to perform a sex act on her brother.</p>
      <p>The mother and son ran to a neighbour's house and stayed there until the police arrived.</p>
      <p>"I was out of the picture. It was the kids he wanted," the woman said.</p>
      <p>McCann denies 37 charges including the rape of a child under 13, kidnap, and sexual assault concerning 11 alleged victims.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
