      <p>Facebook-owned mobile texting company WhatsApp has expressed regret over the Pegasus attack on certain Indian individuals. In an official reply to the Indian government's notice, WhatsApp on Tuesday said that they seek closer engagement with the government over the issue.</p>
      <p>In the reply to the notice by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), WhatsApp said that it has plugged-in certain vulnerabilities in the mobile application which allowed malware to monitor chats.</p>
      <p>CERT-In is examining WhatsApp's reply, official sources said, adding that the government expects WhatsApp to restore its security wall, "any breach won’t be tolerated," the government has told WhatsApp, they said.</p>

      <p>On May 20, WhatsApp reported an incident to the CERT-In stating that they had identified and promptly fixed a vulnerability that could enable an attacker to insert and execute code on mobile devices and that the vulnerability can no longer be exploited to carry out attacks.</p>
      <p>Subsequently, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said on September 5, WhatsApp wrote to CERT-In mentioning an update to the security incident reported in May 2019, that while the full extent of this attack may never be known, WhatsApp continued to review the available information.</p>
      <p>Late October, reports had emerged that prominent human rights activists, journalists and lawyers’ mobile phones had been targeted by Israeli spyware in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections this year.</p>
      <p>Subsequent to that, CERT-In issued a formal notice to WhatsApp seeking submission of relevant details and information.</p>
      <p>The government is also preparing to bring a Personal Data Protection Bill during the ongoing winter session of Parliament.</p>
