      <p>Manchester Evening News reporter Samuel Luckhurst also claims Luke Shaw and Axel Tuanzebe returned to training in a welcome boost for the Red Devils.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s not been the best start to the season for Solskjaer, but having more options like these available to him can only help over the upcoming hectic festive period.</p>
