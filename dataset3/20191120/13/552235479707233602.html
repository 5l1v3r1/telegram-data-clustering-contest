        <b>A dwindling membership has caused the closure of Clackmannanshire’s oldest golf club.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dollar Golf Club members voted at their annual general meeting on Monday to wind up the club and it will shut on December 31.</p>
      <p>A drop in the number of members and an aging membership prompted the move.</p>
      <p>A full membership at the 129-year-old club currently costs £364 and the club has around 120 members.</p>
      <p>Sadness was expressed following Monday’s decision.</p>
      <p>Finance convener Scott Maxwell, who is in his 70s and has been a member of the club for more than 40 years, said: “It’s a hugely sad day.</p>
      <p>“The lack of membership means we have not been financially viable and are losing money.</p>
      <p>“A lack of interest in golf and an aging membership are the main reasons why the decision was taken.</p>
      <p>“Dollar is a notoriously difficult and hilly golf course and I think a lot of the older members have found it quite hard on their knees.</p>
      <p>“There are also several other golf clubs in Clackmannanshire and just not enough players in the area.”</p>
      <p>Two jobs are to be lost as a result of the closure.</p>
      <p>Full time greenkeepers Tony Leech and Willie Glass will be left without work. Mr Maxwell added: “Unfortunately two people will lose their jobs. Tony and Willie have been with us for a number of years and have worked very hard at the club so that’s unfortunate.”</p>
      <p>All other positions at the club are filled by volunteers.</p>
      <p>Dollar Golf Club was founded by a group of local men in 1890, when they opened up a nine-hole course at Market Park.</p>
      <p>With the annual subscription for its 19 members set at 7/6d, it was on fairly flat low-lying ground which is in marked contrast to its present hillside layout.</p>
      <p>Dollar Ladies was founded in 1893, sharing the course with the men.</p>
      <p>That lasted for four years before the men moved to a new nine-hole course on Gloom Hill near Castle Campbell.</p>
      <p>They joined again in 1906 and it was a woman, the Countess of Mar and Kellie, who drove off to open the first 18-hole course in Clackmannanshire.</p>
      <p>Several big name golfers have played the course over the years.</p>
      <p>In June 1910 a professional match was held featuring Open winner Sandy Herd; Open winner and Ryder Cup captain Ted Ray; Open runner-up Tom Ball ; and Open winner and Ryder Cup captain George Duncan.</p>
      <p>In October this year, the Observer reported on the last week of the 2019 summer season with the gents’ closing meeting with the traditional match between teams of the Captain and Vice-Captain.</p>
      <p>With both officials being unavailable on the day, acting captain Drew Ure and acting vice-captain Charlie Murray stepped in.</p>
