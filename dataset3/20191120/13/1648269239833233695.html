      <p>Infiniti entered the U.S. market in 1989 and began selling luxury vehicles on November 8 of that year. Today, the brand operates dealerships in over 50 countries. However, Infiniti’s 30th anniversary also marks a period of change for the company. The company will leave Western Europe early next year as the company moves forward with a plan to electrify its portfolio.  </p>
      <p>The Edition 30 models celebrate Infiniti’s past as the company looks toward the future. The Edition 30 models will launch later this year.  </p>
