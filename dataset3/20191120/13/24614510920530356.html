      <p>The past few months haven’t been kind to <b>Tilray</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tlry-stock-quote/"><b><u>TLRY</u></b></a>). Tilray stock is down from above the $45 price level in July to around $20 today.</p>

      <p>The company reported mixed results at its last earnings release on Nov. 12. While earnings are up year-over-year, sales growth has been slow as of late.</p>
      <p>Add in the poor performance of other “cannabisphere” names like <b>Aurora Cannabis</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/acb-stock-quote/"><b><u>ACB</u></b></a>) and <b>Canopy Growth</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cgc-stock-quote/"><b><u>CGC</u></b></a>), and its clear that (for now) the party’s over for pot stocks.</p>
      <p>But what does that mean for Tilray? The upcoming launch of “Cannabis 2.0” may help the company. But Tilray’s dwindling cash and high debt could leave the company in a capital crunch. Add in a major shareholder who could start unloading shares within the next two years, and there’s plenty of reasons why shares could trade lower.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a closer look, and see why TLRY stock is not a buy today.</p>
      <h3>Recent Developments in Tilray Stock</h3>
      <p>Tilray’s latest earnings release was a mixed bag in terms of the company’s future prospects. Revenue for the quarter ending Sept. 30 was up <a href="https://ir.tilray.com/news-releases/news-release-details/tilray-inc-reports-third-quarter-2019-financial-results">409% year-over-year</a>, but this is a misleading metric. Given that recreational pot has only been legal in Canada since last October, any pot company in business prior to Fall 2018 saw a massive sales bump from the prior year.</p>
      <p>Compare TLRY sales to last quarter and things look less impressive. Tilray’s revenues for the September quarter (excluding excise taxes) were $48.2 million, compared to $42 million in the quarter ending June 30. The company continues to lose money, with <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ebitda.asp">EBITDA</a> losses of $28.9 million for the quarter (compared with $25.9 million last quarter).</p>
      <p>Tilray’s poor performance has been blunted thanks to last February’s Manitoba Harvest acquisition. As <i>InvestorPlace’s</i> Will Ashworth wrote Nov. 18, without this deal, Tilray’s operating losses would have <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/manitoba-harvest-tilray-stock-this-quarter/">increased by 37.5% YoY as opposed to just 16.5%</a>.</p>
      <p>Manitoba Foods sells CBD-infused foods. High-margin marijuana products are the future for the pot industry. With <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/cannabis-2-0-not-enough-save-canopy-growth-stock/">looming inventory and poor distribution</a>, it’s tough to make money selling straight-up weed. But with these emerging branded products, TLRY stock has a clear path to upside.</p>
      <p>An upcoming catalyst for Tilray stock is “Cannabis 2.0”. This is when products like cannabis-infused beverages, edibles, and vapes hit Canadian shelves. These higher-margin products could help use up pot supply, and help the floundering industry pivot towards profits.</p>
      <p>Tilray has thrown its hat in the ring with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2019-10-10/fluent-beverage-company-announces-plans-to-commercialize-non-alcohol-cbd-infused-beverages-in-canada">Fluent Beverage Company</a>. This <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ab-inbev-tilray-beverages/brewer-ab-inbev-partners-with-tilray-to-tap-cannabis-drink-market-idUSKCN1OI2M4">joint venture</a> with <b>Anheuser-Busch Inbev</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/bud-stock-quote/"><b><u>BUD</u></b></a>) plans to start with CBD-infused drinks, with THC-infused drinks in development. But are infused beverages the answer to the company’s issues. TLRY remains overvalued, even as the company faces liquidity risks.</p>
      <h3>Valuation and Dilution a Concern With TLRY</h3>
      <p>Tilray stock remains overvalued. On an enterprise value/sales basis, Tilray trades at a premium to Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth. Tilray also trades at a higher multiple than other major peers like <b>Hexo</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hexo-stock-quote/"><b><u>HEXO</u></b></a>).</p>
      <p>One major pot stock, <b>Cronos Group</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cron-stock-quote/"><b><u>CRON</u></b></a>), trades at a higher valuation. But unlike Cronos, Tilray does not a deep-pocketed strategic partner. Cronos may be overvalued, but <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/with-altria-in-drivers-seat-tough-to-play-cronos-stock/">financial backing from <b>Altria</b></a> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/mo-stock-quote/"><b><u>MO</u></b></a>) may help it weather continued losses.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, Tilray has cash troubles. The company’s cash and cash equivalents have fallen from $487.2m at the start to 2019 to $100.2m as of September 30. If losses continue (or accelerate), the company’s cash needs could become a greater risk.</p>
      <p>But Stifel’s Andrew Carter is not so worried. He believes TLRY has enough cash to “<a href="https://www.investors.com/news/tilray-stock-q319-earnings-marijuana-stocks/">satisfy its investment needs through (the second half of 2020)</a>“.</p>
      <p>How about after 2020?</p>
      <p>Tilray has <a href="https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/7dc3738e-0155-4397-b0c2-dbc95236cc3b">$475 million worth</a> of outstanding convertible notes, due in April 2023. But these notes were issued back when Tilray stock was trading above $100/share. The <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181004005887/en/Tilray-Upsizes-Prices-Offering-US450-Million-Convertible">conversion price is $167.41/share</a>. Assuming TLRY stock doesn’t rally back to 2018 levels, the company will need to refinance once the notes mature. This may mean a dilutive raising of equity.</p>
      <p>Back in October, I discussed another downside risk factor: Tilray’s majority shareholders may be looking to sell their position. <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/nothing-special-tilray-stock/">They are subject to a lockup</a>, but this lockup starts to end within a year. Two years out, and the investors are free to dump their Tilray shares.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line: Tread Carefully with Tilray Stock</h3>
      <p>Tilray stock is a minefield of risk. “Cannabis 2.0” could improve their fortunes. But a myriad of risks remain. With $450 million in convertible notes coming due in 2023, TLRY needs to improve its cash situation.</p>
      <p>Unless the company is swimming in green (cash, not pot) by then, Tilray will need a capital infusion to stay afloat. Add in potential selling pressure from Privateer shareholders unloading their position, and there are too many fleas on this dog for my taste.</p>
      <p>Other pot stocks may offer a clearer path to success. Consider them before taking a look at TLRY stock.</p>
