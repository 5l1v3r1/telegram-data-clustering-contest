      <p>Nearly a year since the trial opened, delays continue to hamper the trial of Afshin Ighani, accused of an armed kidnapping in Princeton back in 2017.</p>
      <p>Ighani returned to Penticton Supreme Court Wednesday, self-represented after firing his lawyer back in May, attempting to argue he hadn’t had the chance to cross-examine one of the Crown’s witnesses and alleged victims.</p>
      <p>He faces 10 counts related to<a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/243658/cop-describes-frantic-arrest"> his arrest </a>at a Princeton trailer park on April 22, 2017. Prosecutors allege he took <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/243532/2nd-witness-scared-for-life">Jodie Walker</a> and her then-boyfriend Christopher Gliege hostage at gunpoint while he was being hunted for a shooting in Oliver days prior.</p>
      <p>Ighani tried to convince Justice Nitya Iyer Wednesday to recall Walker so he could cross examine her. Iyer refused, after playing back a recording of the court proceedings from May, that showed the defence already questioned Walker and Crown had rested its case prior to <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/255933/trial-halted-after-lawyer-fired">Ighani firing his lawyer. </a></p>
      <p>When asked by the judge if he would call any evidence in his own defence, Ighani claimed he had been unable to read some of the disclosure files provided to him on a disc due to computer problems at the prison. </p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor John Swanson indicate the vast majority of the disclosure provided to Ighani would have been in hard copy, adding the prison staff assured him the computer at the prison should have been able to read the disc just fine. </p>
      <p>Appearing increasingly annoyed with Ighani’s request for yet another adjournment, Justice Iyer ordered the sheriffs drive back to the Okanagan Correctional Centre with Ighani to retrieve the disc that he claims does not work.</p>
      <p>Iyer ordered Swanson to examine the disc to ensure Ighani had already received everything in paper form, and if not, to provide him with a hard copy of the missing files so he can study them overnight.</p>
      <p>Ighani will be back in court Thursday morning. If he declines to call any evidence or witnesses, the trial will end and will be in Iyer’s hands for a verdict. </p>
      <p>Ighani is also <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/266544/ighani-granted-adjournment">facing separate charges</a> for allegedly stabbing two protective custody inmates at OCC in 2017 and allegedly assaulting a prison guard in 2018.</p>
      <p>He was the subject of two deportation orders for criminal activity in 2002 and 2007 that were eventually overturned.</p>
