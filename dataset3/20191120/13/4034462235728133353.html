      <p>Back in September, Land Rover <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/all-new-2020-land-rover-defender-reborn-for-a-new-generation">lifted the wraps off the all-new Defender</a> at the 2019 Frankfurt Auto Show. Now, the rugged off-roader has made its North American debut at the 2019 LA Auto Show. Reborn for a new generation, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/land-rover/defender">2020 Land Rover Defender</a> retains its predecessor's iconic boxy look but has been updated with a modernized exterior, a revamped interior, and more advanced tech to make it the most capable Land Rover ever made.</p>
      <p>Pricing has remained a mystery, but Land Rover has now confirmed how much the new Defender will cost when it goes on sale next year.</p>
