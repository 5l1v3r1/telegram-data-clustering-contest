      <p>Authorities nabbed a 48-year-old fugitive in the woods of Kauai after a 7-day manhunt.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Marshals Task Force and Kauai police located and arrested Orlando Manguchei in a wooded area above Wailua Monday. He was wanted on a federal warrant for violating terms of the conditions of his supervised release.</p>
      <p>In 2017, Manguchei was convicted in federal court on three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm and/or ammunition. He was sentenced to a 46-month prison term and three years of supervised release, according to a U.S. Marshals Service news release.</p>
      <p>Manguchei was released from custody in September.</p>
      <p>Authorities recently issued an arrest warrant after he failed to comply with terms of his supervised release.</p>
      <p>Through an investigation, law enforcement discovered he was living in the mountains to evade capture and that his close associates provided him shelter, food, supplies, transportation and other resources.</p>
      <p>He will be transported back to Oahu to appear in federal court.</p>
      <p>In March 2014, authorities arrested him on a state parole arrest warrant following a 23-day manhunt through the woods and mountains of Kauai.</p>
