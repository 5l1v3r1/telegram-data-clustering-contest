      <p>Tamworth entrepreneurs’ ingenious initiative sold out in just NINETY seconds and raised thousands of pounds for charity.</p>
      <p>Cherish Reardon started Popsy Clothing with her husband Greg. She was hoping to be able to sell a few dresses from home while looking after her daughters as she struggled with her confidence.</p>
      <p>Three years on and it has been a major success, so much so that their newest initative was to design and sell a poppy dress for Remembrance Day with 100 per cent of proceeds going to the Royal British Legion. The couple were amazed at the response.</p>
      <p>Cherish beamed: “We never expected the response the poppy dress had and couldn’t believe that it sold out within 90 seconds of going on the website. We raised £2,400 in less than two minutes!</p>
      <p>“It was amazing being able to see so many photos of our customers wearing such a special dress on Remembrance Day and being able to support such an incredible charity.”</p>

      <p>Explaining how it all came about, she continued: “We have a community of 50,000 women and we now help thousands of women with their confidence with meets up across the country. Real friendships have been made and fashion advice and meet ups have taken place.</p>
      <p>“We are extremely passionate. This was recognised and we were approached by Gok Wan and worked with him for his One Size Fits All Roadshow, providing garments for his catwalk show. We have been seen on BBC news, This Morning, Mock The Week, The One Show and Pointless just to name a few. We have had a super busy time and we are just getting started.</p>
      <p>“Last year our customers were asking us if we could design a dress that could be worn on Remembrance Day. Greg and I both loved the idea and thought it would be a great way to be able to raise some money for The Royal British Legion so we decided to design a poppy dress and donate 100 per cent of profits. My Grandad was in the army as was my cousin so it is a charity close to our hearts.</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>“We are handing over our cheque on Thursday at St Edithas Church in town to four ex servicemen (the eldest being 89) with their war medals outside of the war memorial.</p>
      <p>“We have decided we will be doing our poppy dress again next year and doing them on pre order so we are able to meet the huge demand and raise even more money for charity.”</p>
      <p>The Royal British Legion said: “Thanks to our incredible supporters, we can provide life-changing support for the Armed Forces community.</p>
      <p>“We are the country’s largest Armed Forces charity, with 235,000 members, 110,000 volunteers and a network of partners and charities; helping to make sure we can provide support wherever and whenever it’s needed.</p>
      <p>“Whether you’re a fundraiser, volunteer, member or proud Poppy Appeal collector – however you choose to support us, we couldn’t do it without you.”</p>
