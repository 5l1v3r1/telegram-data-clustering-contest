      <p>Cape Town - Following extensive engagement with Burna Boy's management team, Phambili Media and Play Network have decided to withdraw Burna Boy from the Africans Unite Concert.</p>
      <p>As a result, both legs of the concert which were set to take place on the 23 November at Hillcrest Quarry, Cape Town and 24 November 2019 at Sun Arena, Pretoria have now been cancelled.</p>
      <p>The decision to cancel the Africans Unite Concert comes after the call from the Tshwane Entertainment Collective to boycott the Africans Unite concert in Tshwane. With the increasing threats of violence from other unfortunate segments of the public and without any government intervention, Phambili Media and Play Network Africa were prompted to take the threats and warnings seriously, as the safety of all artists and attendees could not be guaranteed. </p>
      <p>"We then decided to cancel the concert. The safety of all attendees, artists and crew comes first," said Phambili Media. </p>
      <p>"We do, however, stand behind our decision for the initial inclusion of Burna Boy in the Africans Unite Concert line-up. As one of the artists at the centre stage of the xenophobic attacks uproar, we saw fit to engage him to be a part of the Africans Unite campaign that aims to ultimately change the current negative narrative to that of solidarity and unity. It seems we have failed in this regard.</p>
      <p>"As organisers of the Africans Unite Concert, we continue to advocate for unity and peace. Moreover, we condemn any form of discrimination, violence or aggressive behaviour towards any person due to their gender or nationality," the statement continues.  </p>
