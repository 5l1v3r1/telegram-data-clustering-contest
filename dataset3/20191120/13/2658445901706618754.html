      <p>The Lagos State House of Assembly has filed a preliminary objection challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the suit filed by former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode.</p>
      <p>It is, therefore, asking the court to strike out the suit.</p>
      <p>Ambode, in the suit, is seeking to stop the probe of his administration over procurement of 820 buses for public transportation.</p>
      <p>At Wednesday’s proceeding, lead counsel for the state Assembly, Lawal Pedro, SAN, informed the court that Ambode’s lawyer Taiwo Oyetibo has served his team with a copy of his client counter affidavit to the preliminary objection.</p>
      <p>The matter was subsequently adjourned to February 16, 2019 for hearing.</p>
      <p>At the last proceeding, Justice Yetunde Adesanya had ordered parties in the suit to maintain status quo.</p>
      <p>Other defendants in the suit include House Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa; House Clerk, Mr A.A Sanni; Chairman of the Ad hoc probe committee, Fatai Mojeed and all members of the committee.</p>
