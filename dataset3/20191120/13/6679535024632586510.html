On location to shoot <i>Fresh Off The Boat </i>Now that the first day of shoot is over and I’m still alive and not shaking with nervous energy .... here is a photo... It’s amazing how a change of scene can make you feel like a newcomer. Loving and absorbing it all.”</p>
      <p>Along with it, she shared a mirror selfie clicked in her make-up room.</p>
