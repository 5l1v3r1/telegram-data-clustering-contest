      <p>In remembrance of their tragic November 19 bus crash in 2015, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/the-ghost-inside/">The Ghost Inside</a> have unveiled a brand-new live video of Mercy, as well as paying tribute to the two drivers who lost their lives in the collision.</p>
      <p>“In TGI world, we have come to call November 19 our re-birthday,” the band posted in a statement alongside the new clip. “Today we celebrate by sharing a live music video of Mercy from <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/the-ghost-insides-comeback-show-was-a-triumph-over-tragedy/">our show this summer in Los Angeles</a>. We want to honor the drivers Greg and Stephen that lost their lives, and say thank you to all of our loved ones for their unconditional support. To every single person that supports this band in any way, there are really no words to describe how you make us feel. Every kind word, donation, tattoo, comment, or even just a listen to a song, has carried us from the lowest moment of our lives through to today. We owe you a debt that can never be repaid, but we will try our best to make you proud.</p>
      <p>“Together, all of us, we are limitless &amp; unbreakable. See you in 2020.”</p>

      <p>Kerrang! recently caught up with The Ghost Inside bassist Jim Riley to chat about the <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/the-ghost-inside-have-announced-their-only-uk-show-of-2020/">announcement of the band’s first UK show</a> following the bus crash.</p>
      <p>Discussing the logistics of playing live these days, Jim admits: “It takes months for us to aim for a show right now. Getting the fitness together to perform for 60 or 90 minutes doesn’t happen overnight, and it’s even harder when your body takes twice as long to recover from a workout. The summer will be our first attempt at putting a couple of shows together, and it’s something we know we have to really prepare for.”</p>
      <p>As well as their first attempt at multiple dates since 2015, Jim reveals that there will be new music in time for their forthcoming live shows in Germany and the UK, expanding on the band’s recording sessions: “This is the first record without [former lead guitarist and co-founder] Aaron Brooks, and first with Chris Davis. Aaron was the main guy to put the ideas together before, and we’re doing it much more as a group on this one. There’s also a freedom now to explore the TGI sound in any way we want. We are so far removed – almost six years – from the Dear Youth process, and the band has grown so much as individuals and as a collective that we bring a lot of new things to the table.”</p>
