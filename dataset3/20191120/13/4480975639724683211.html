          <b>The positive momentum falters near 5-1/2 month-old descending trend-line resistance.</b>

          <b>The pair quickly retreats back below the 1.3300 handle but hold above the 200-day SMA.</b>

      <p>The USD/CAD pair maintained its strong bid tone through the early North-American session, albeit retreated few pips from multi-week tops on mostly in line Canadian CPI.<br/> <br/>A sustained move beyond the very important 200-day SMA was seen as a key trigger for bullish traders and assisted the pair to build on the previous session's strong upsurge.<br/> <br/>The pair, however, struggled to make it through a 5-1/2 month-old descending trend-line <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, which should now act as a key pivotal point for short-term traders.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> held well within the bullish territory and further reinforce the constructive outlook, though recovering oil prices might cap gains.<br/> <br/>Moreover, oscillators on hourly charts are already flashing slightly overbought conditions and also warrant some caution ahead of the release of the latest <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> meeting minutes.<br/> <br/>Hence, it will be prudent to wait for a strong follow-through buying beyond the mentioned barrier before positioning for any further near-term appreciating move towards mid-1.3300s.</p>
