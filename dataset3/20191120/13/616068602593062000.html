      <p>A convicted child rapist has lost an appeal of his sentence in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>In May 2015, S.C.W. pleaded guilty to sexual interference of a child under 16 and making child pornography. A year and a half later, he was sentenced to seven years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Castanet is not identifying the man, due to the possibility that doing so could lead to identification of the victim, who is protected under a publication ban.</p>
      <p>The Kelowna man's arrest dates back to 2012, when police caught him in the act of sexually abusing a 12-year-old child. He was 43 at the time.</p>
      <p>On S.C.W.'s seized computer, officers found 129 photos and eight videos of sexual abuse of the child. The police investigation found the abuse of the child had been ongoing for more than a year.</p>
      <p>“The videos must be experienced to fully understand the full measure of the crushing depravity of the acts,” Justice Mark Takahashi said in his sentencing. “They were witness to the psychological dismemberment and decapitation of the sexual being of a pre-adolescent child.</p>
      <p>“Breathless in their brutality, there are no words to describe the despair one felt for the child or the loathing for (S.C.W.), except a deep and abiding sadness.”</p>
      <p>S.C.W. had been in a position of trust with the child for more than five years.</p>
      <p>During sentencing, defence brought forth evidence from a clinical and forensic psychologist who said S.C.W. posed a low risk of reoffending, but Takahashi rejected the report.</p>
      <p>“How can a person who is a low risk to reoffend repeatedly victimize a child in a sexual way? This defies belief,” Takahashi said during sentencing.</p>
      <p>In his appeal, S.C.W. argued the sentencing judge erred by not taking into account the psychologist's report, and by treating the victims' young age as an aggravating factor.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the B.C. Court of Appeal determined the sentencing judge was under no obligation to accept the psychologist's opinion. Additionally, the appeals court noted that prior cases have found a victim's young age is “relevant to assessing her degree of vulnerability and the age difference” between the victim and abuser, which is relevant to assessing S.C.W.'s degree of culpability.</p>
      <p>“The egregiousness of the sexual offence against a child increases as the age of the child decrease,” Justice Richard Goepel said in the recent decision, adding that he's dismissing the appeal.</p>
      <p>S.C.W. has remained in custody since his sentencing hearing in late 2016.</p>
