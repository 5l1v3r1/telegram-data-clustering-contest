      <h1>Man charged £490 for three-minute stay at airport car park</h1>
      <h2>He has been promised a full refund by Bristol Airport</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T13:22:55+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 13:22</time> by <a rel="author">Jasper King, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>A man was left baffled after he was charged £490 for a three-minute stay at an airport car park.</p>
      <p>Mike Breslin was dropping off his son at Bristol Airport, and was expecting to pay the usual £3 drop-off fee, but was shocked to find he had been charged hundreds of pounds.</p>
      <p>Luckily, he was been promised a full refund by the company.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-airport-car-parking-charge-3553236">Bristol Live</a> : "This morning [Monday, November 18] I entered the drop-off point at circa 05:40 and was there for 3 or 4 minutes and left. I paid by card.</p>
      <p>"Today I have been contacted by my credit card company about suspicious activity on my card and it turns out I was charged £490 for my three-minute stay.</p>
      <p>"Thank you credit card company as you were more vigilant than me as I expected to pay £3 and did not even check when I keyed my pin."</p>

      <p>Mr Breslin contacted Bristol Airport to discover how something like this could have happened.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the airport said: "We apologise to the customer for any inconvenience caused after recently using the Drop and Go car park.</p>
      <p>"After investigations we established the customer used the car park two weeks ago to drop family at the airport and on driving to the exit there was a fault with the barrier.</p>
      <p>"As the barrier uses car number plate recognition technology, the system did not record the vehicle departing the car park.</p>
      <p>"On the driver's return to the same car park two weeks later to collect family, the system charged for a two-week stay instead of three minutes.</p>
      <p>"We have been in direct contact with the customer and a refund has been arranged and our apologies extended."</p>
      <p>Bristol Live later contacted Mr Breslin for a response to the apology.</p>

      <p>He said: "To alleviate the congestion one of the car park attendants started letting people out via a barrier that was not working and thus I left free of charge.</p>
      <p>"I guess that there was therefore no record of my car exiting via the NPRS the next time I left which was two weeks later I guess they charged me for the whole period which was £490.</p>
      <p>"I have been in contact with the airport and they have promised that I will be refunded in the next few days. The lady I dealt with was very helpful to be fair."</p>
      <p>But despite his praise for the helpful customer service he received at the airport, he's critical about the pricing and car parking system at the airport.</p>
      <p>He says: "There is massive dissatisfaction with Bristol Airport and the new parking charges that have been put in place.</p>
      <p>"It would not be bad if they put the infrastructure in place to support the changes.</p>
      <p>"In effect due to long queues at the paying machines everyone is moaning not just about extortionate charges but then getting really angry that due to delays, by the time you pay it has gone into the next band through no fault of your own.</p>
      <p>"Like most people that use the airport regularly, there is a lot of anger at the airport's approach to its most important thing - customers, or as Bristol Airport now treats them, cash cows.</p>
      <p>"As usual nowadays it was pretty chaotic departing from the 'drop-off' car park with long queues and irate drivers."</p>
