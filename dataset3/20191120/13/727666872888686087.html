      <p>It seems the rapper/actor was so excited he misspelled words in his tweet.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson took a break from <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/naturi-naughton-responds-to-getting-trolled-by-50-cent-again-hfrz9--FykKBVzRsJqSfoQ/">trolling his own <i>Power</i> co-star Naturi Naughton</a> long enough to show love to a popular music artist. 50 Cent uploaded a video of Lizzo twerking to his Twitter page and added a suggestive caption.</p>
      <p>"👀Now that’s the love boat, I’m not saying you can’t Handel [sic] it, but you can’t Handel [sic] it. 🤷🏽‍♂️😏 big sexy #LeCheminDuRoi #bransoncognac," wrote the G-Unit leader.</p>
      <p>50 Cent likely got enough mentions about spelling "handle" wrong twice that he returned to the social media platform to address the grammar blunder. He blamed the typo on his iPhone not catching the error.</p>
      <p>"F*ck y’all my spell check 🤨not working," posted the 44-year-old entertainment magnate. "I was typing fast, I’m not gonna fix it since it’s so entertaining."</p>
      <p>For her part, Lizzo seemed appreciative of 50 Cent's social media shout out. The "Good As Hell" vocalist retweeted Fiddy's "big sexy" message to her 1.2 million followers.</p>
