      <p>This year’s Los Angeles motor show has been jam-packed with new reveals from some of the biggest manufacturers in the world. SUVs, electric cars and convertibles have all been announced at one of the motoring world’s key events.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look at some of the key reveals of the day and everything you need to know about them.</p>
      <h3>Aston Martin DBX</h3>

      <p>After months of teasers and camouflage pictures, Aston Martin’s first-ever SUV – the DBX – is here. It’s turned out to be quite a looker too, with recognisably Aston styling touches blended onto a larger bodystyle.</p>
      <p>Plus, a 4.0-litre turbocharged V8 engine with 542bhp means the DBX can do 0-60mph in under 4.5 seconds. More space doesn’t have to mean less performance then, according to Aston.</p>
      <h3>Mini John Cooper Works GP</h3>

      <p>The Mini John Cooper Works GP is a car with a large reputation. Setting the benchmark for hardcore, performance-focused hot hatches, it’s been a car beloved by enthusiasts and now there’s a new one.</p>
      <p>With plenty of power and track-influenced styling tweaks, it’s a car which will likely command attention.</p>
      <h3>Audi e-tron Sportback</h3>

      <p>Audi’s e-tron has already done well as the firm’s first production electric car, and now the firm has followed on from a trend in the rest of its range by releasing a sleeker, more dynamic-looking Sportback version.</p>
      <p>More efficient in terms of drag, it can offer a 277-mile range as well as high-tech digital matrix headlights.</p>
      <h3>Volkswagen ID. Space Vizzion</h3>

      <p>Volkswagen has previewed the electric future of the estate car with its latest ‘ID.’ concept — the Space Vizzion.</p>
      <p>Previewing a production model that’s planned to hit the roads in 2021, the Space Vizzion boasts a 367-mile range between charges as well as a punchy 335bhp. The cabin uses a new material made from the residue of apple juice production now, as well as augmented reality technologies.</p>
      <h3>Lexus LC500 Convertible</h3>

        <figcaption>(Lexus)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>We’ve long-known a convertible version of the LC500 grand tourer was on its way, but Lexus has at last shown off the production car.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t differ hugely from the prototype showcased at this year’s Goodwood Festival of Speed, but that’s no bad thing. It brings drop-top flair to the V8 model and will reach roads at the end of summer 2020.</p>
      <h3>Toyota RAV4 Prime PHEV</h3>

      <p>Toyota is taking a little bit of a spin away from its usual ‘self-charging hybrid’ marketing by introducing a plug-in version of its Rav4.</p>
      <p>Though not its first PHEV — having twice made such variants of the Prius — this is the firm time for the SUV, which produces a whopping 302bhp in its Prime guise. Toyota is also expecting it to be capable of 37 miles of electric-only driving.</p>
      <h3>Ford Mustang Mach-E</h3>

        <figcaption>(Ford)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Ford’s first dive into the booming EV SUV market is a controversial first effort, to say the least.</p>
      <p>Taking the iconic Mustang name, a model famously V8 and not an SUV, and applying it to an all-electric high-rider is certainly one way to get people talking. This Tesla Model Y rival looks the business though and boasts a range of up to 370 miles in some specifications. Time will tell if it can establish itself.</p>
