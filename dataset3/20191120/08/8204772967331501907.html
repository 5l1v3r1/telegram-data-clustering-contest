      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ryan+Giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> savoured “one of the greatest nights” of his career after leading Wales to Euro 2020 and insisted his team can continue to flourish after <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Aaron+Ramsey">Aaron Ramsey</a> struck twice on his return to the starting lineup to secure passage to a third major tournament finals.</p>
      <p>Ramsey scored in each half in victory against Hungary and Giggs is adamant there is further room for Wales – who reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016 under <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Chris+Coleman">Chris Coleman</a> – to grow.</p>
      <p>“It is a special, special night,” he said. “The lads have showed great determination and quality and a never-give-up attitude. They deserve all the plaudits.</p>
      <p>“There was no room for error and the quality and concentration they have shown, they deserve it. It is one of the greatest nights of my life. I achieved a lot as a player but it’s different as a manager, the pressure you are under, and you are helpless as a manager. I was never nervous as a player but as a manager you are. Come game day, it is out of your hands.</p>
      <p>“As a player, you want to play in major championships. My first memory of a major championship was the 1982 World Cup. It’s different as a manager. This is different.</p>
      <p>“It feels amazing – the group of players I have got and my staff. I am a relatively young coach and I could not have done it without my staff. Together we did it. As a player, basically you look after yourself. You are quite selfish. As a manager you have to manage everything, so it’s a completely different kettle of fish. This is just the beginning. We have seen a lot of young players over the last 18 months and they can get better.”</p>
      <p>Giggs was effusive in his praise of Ramsey, who scored his first Wales goals since September last year – a first-half header from a <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Gareth+Bale">Gareth Bale</a> cross followed by a close-range finish two minutes after the interval. “We have missed him,” Giggs added. “We have some very good players but they don’t grow on trees – players who make the difference. Aaron was the difference.”</p>
      <p>Ramsey said: “We had the best time of our lives in France so we wanted to make sure we really got it this time, having missed out on the World Cup. It was a big effort and I missed a lot of this campaign but it was all worthwhile and to chip in with a couple of goals is amazing. We inspired a nation last time out [AT EURO 2016], so we wanted to do it again.” - Guardian</p>
