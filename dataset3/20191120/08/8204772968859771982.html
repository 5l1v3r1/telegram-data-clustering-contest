      <p>One of life’s pleasures in music is to see an artist you really admire graduate from venue to venue, each one bigger than the previous one they performed in, and then finally make boom-bam-bosh big time without losing a shred of what made you love them in the first place.</p>
      <p>Norwegian songwriter <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sigrid">Sigrid</a> must have played Ireland 10 times in the past two years, and not once have we witnessed a poor gig. The music is a mirror image of the artist: unpretentious but dynamic. Songs will be mostly from this year’s debut album, Sucker Punch, but we’re guessing the next batch of songs are already written, so expect a few new ones, too. Advice? Be nice and kind – don’t kill her vibe. – <b>Tony Clayton-Lea</b></p>
      <h3>When and where are the gigs?</h3>
      <p>On Friday evening, at 3Arena in Dublin.</p>
      <h3>Who’s the support act?</h3>
      <p>Special guests are north London electropop duo Ider, whose debut album Emotional Education gained widespread praise, and Moyka, a fellow Norwegian popster who released her debut EP, Circles, last month.</p>
      <h3>What time should I arrive?</h3>
      <p>Doors open at 6.30pm. The stage times are:<br/>7pm: Moyka<br/>8pm: Ider<br/>9pm: Sigrid</p>
      <h3>How do I get there – and home again?</h3>
      <p>Parking is available in the Point Village car park (you can book through <b><a href="https://www.ticketmaster.ie/sigrid-dublin-22-11-2019/event/180055654C026FC5">Ticketmaster</a></b> for €13.85), but better to leave the car at home and use the Luas – get off at the final stop of the red line, the Point. There are usually extra trams on show nights because of the increased demand. The last Luas is scheduled to leave the Point at 12.30am on Saturday.</p>
