      <p>Ashleigh Brilliant is one of our local treasures and he has given us his first new book in about twenty years. It is titled "I Need More Time - And I Probably Always Will".</p>
      <p><a href="http://swt.org/events/ashleigh-2019-1118/">Here</a> are my photos and videos of him at his book signing on Monday at Chaucer's Bookstore.</p>
      <p>Back in May 2018 Ashleigh spoke at the Humanist Society and I explained how I have known him for about 35 years. And how I first came to know of his epigram creations as a child at the Chicago airport exactly 50 years ago. <a href="https://www.edhat.com/news/support-your-local-god">Here</a> is that article.</p>
      <p>Ashleigh was kind enough to pose with me. He also posed with his publisher, Erin Graffy:</p>

      <p>I was then privileged to be able to make a video of his modest speech as he presented his book to the world:</p>

      <p>He said that with the limited time available, he thought the best use of his time would be to answer questions. Questions, that is, that he thought were most likely to be asked. Before they were asked!</p>
      <p>So... Be sure to support our local writer, publisher and bookstore by heading over to Chaucer's to get your own copy of "I Need More Time - And I Probably Always Will"!</p>
