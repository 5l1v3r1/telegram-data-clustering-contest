      <p>A 32-3 success at Shrewsbury lifted the Delves Road men to within five points of third-placed Leek.</p>
      <p>Walsall completely dominated the opening quarter of the contest and had the win wrapped up inside the opening 15 minutes after establishing a 24-0 lead.</p>
      <p>Jack Crowhurst was the first man on the scoresheet, charging in from 30 metres, with Roger Weston adding the conversion.</p>
      <p>And the visitors didnâ€™t have to wait very long for a second score as they struck again from the restart.</p>
      <p>Louis Vale, Will Hennessey, Rob Angell and Weston combined to free Zach Edwards, who glided over the line for a converted score.</p>
      <p>A Weston penalty increased the advantage before Edwards added a fine solo try, which was again converted by Weston.</p>
      <p>The second half proved to be a frustrating one for the visitors, as they wasted several good openings. But Weston added another penalty before they finally grabbed a fifth try through Tom Aston.</p>
      <p>Burntwood drew 20-20 with Moseley Oak.</p>
      <p>In Midlands 3 West (North), Eccleshall lost 19-17 at Linley, while Wednesbury went down 32-3 at Telford.</p>
      <p>Aldridge maintained their Midlands 4 West (North) title push with a 23-16 win at Essington.</p>
