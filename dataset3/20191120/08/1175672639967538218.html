      <p><b>Dezeen promotion:</b> Silicon Valley design-build firm Katerra has launched a brand called KOVA that offers "simple, timeless" building <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/product-design/">products</a> and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/materials/">materials</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kovaproducts.com/">KOVA</a> was founded by <a href="https://www.katerra.com/country-selector/">Katerra</a> to offer architects, designers and trade professionals a one-stop shop for high quality but low-cost materials and products.</p>
      <p>Its products range from large appliances and cabinetry through to lighting, window coverings, plumbing, flooring and ceramic tiles.</p>

      <p>"As designers and builders specify and order their products, they may go through a lot of different partners for their plumbing, lighting, cabinets, countertops, etcetera," said Trevor Schick, head of the KOVA.</p>
      <p>"KOVA is a one-stop shop where we provide all of these materials at a premium quality and great design, but at a better value and with a quicker turnaround," Schick continued.</p>
      <p>"So, as a developer is looking at what they can do to drive cost down and simplify delivery on a project, KOVA is now one of the levers they can pull."</p>

      <p>The brand's name, KOVA, is derived from the prefix "co" and the Spanish word "va", which translates as "go".</p>
      <p>This is intended to symbolise "that design, quality and value can go together and strike a perfect balance".</p>

      <p>All KOVA Select products are designed in Seattle by its in-house design team.</p>
      <p>The items are designed to complement any style, enabling users to easily achieve "fully coordinated" and timeless finishes throughout the living spaces they are designing or building.</p>

      <p>One of KOVA's first collections is KOVA Select, the brand's premium line of products that "offers superior design without the premium prices".</p>
      <p>This includes modular plumbing fixtures that are designed to be as simple as possible, with classic geometric forms and minimal ornamentation.</p>
