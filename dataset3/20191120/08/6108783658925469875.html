      <h3>Available now on PC and coming soon to Xbox and PS4.</h3>
      <p>A <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/">Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order</a> </i>patch has been released to PC and will soon be available on both Xbox One and PS4, developer Respawn has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The patch does the following, as confirmed via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallenOrder/comments/dy8ip5/star_wars_jedi_fallen_order_patch_notes_wc_nov_18/">Reddit</a>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We’ve fixed a texture flickering issue that would display on the screen while driving the AT-AT on Kashyyyk</li>
        <li>Sometimes the input from the arrow keys would fail to respond within menus, this has now been fixed.</li>
        <li>Dynamic resolution settings will now save properly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issued where the game could become slow and loading times longer than expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On Xbox One X, we’re encountering texture pop-in issues that sometimes means that we don’t have a floor to walk on. Oops.</p>
