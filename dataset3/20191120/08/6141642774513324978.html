      <h1>Islanders short-changed by NatWest cash machine</h1>
      <h2>NATWEST has issued an apology to Islanders who found themselves being short-changed at one of their ATMs this week.</h2>

      <p>The apology comes after an Islander posted a warning online claiming that the NatWest cash machine at Waitrose on Rue de Prés had issued her with half of the money that she had requested.</p>
      <p>According to the Facebook user, she attempted to withdraw £40 from the machine and was issued with two £10 notes. The machine stated that no £20 notes were available.</p>
      <p>Other Islanders commented on her post saying that they had experienced the same thing, with one person saying they had received £100 in £10 notes after requesting £200. Some expressed concerns about how they would prove how much they had been short changed by and how they would be compensated.</p>
      <p>Paul Brookes, head of NatWest local banking Jersey, said: ‘We were made aware of an issue with one of our cash machines at Rue de Prés on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>‘The ATM is now working as it should and we believe this to be an isolated case. We are sorry for any inconvenience caused and if any users of the ATM at Rue de Prés believe that incorrect funds were dispensed, please contact the bank or branch where your account is held so the matter can be resolved.’</p>
