      <p>Here’s your first look at former Great British Bake Off hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins as assassins in their new comedy Hitmen.</p>
      <p>Mel and Sue will star in their first ever sitcom as contract killers Jamie and Fran, who are completely useless at their job. Naturally this leads them into some bizarre and hilarious situations.</p>
      <p>It’s definitely a departure for the ladies and they are looking great in this first look picture from the show. We have a feeling Sue is going to spark more than a few girl crushes with this look.</p>
      <p>The scripts were written by Joe Parham and Joe Markham, which includes ‘incompetence, bickering and inane antics’ from the misfit characters.</p>
      <p>Sue previously said of the project: ‘I can’t wait to sit for months on end in a hot van with my old, flatulent, double act partner.’</p>

      <p>Mel added: ‘It’s 30 years ago that I met Sue Perkins, and we had happy times together playing ridiculous characters, then spent hours in a fetid van in order to release them around the country.</p>
      <p>‘Essentially nothing has changed in the Mel/Sue collective. And that’s a great comfort.’</p>

      <p>The Thronecast presenter, 50, previously shared a behind the scenes look at the show, tweeting a picture of herself and Mel, 51, standing in the doorway of a blue wooden hut holding cups of coffee.</p>
      <p>Sue commented at the time: ‘So excited to be reunited with my favourite partner-in-crime.’</p>
      <p>In the past Mel and Sue have hosted Light Lunch in the 90s, its follow up Late Lunch and the self-titled talk show Mel &amp; Sue.</p>
      <p>The pair famously quit The Great British Bake Off in 2017 in protest over its move from BBC One to Channel 4.</p>
