      <p>Chelsea striker, Ike Ugbo, is grateful for the support of Tore Andre Flo as he continues to thrive on his loan spell at Roda JC.</p>
      <p> The youngster is on a season-long deal with Roda, where he has shone on the Eerste Division, and reveals is in regular contact with the Blues loans manager Flo.</p>
      <p> Ugbo told <i>chelseafc.com</i>, “Tore has been working with me since my first loan, so he’s seen everything over the past couple of years and he’s really pleased with me right now. It’s great as a striker to have him on hand.</p>
      <p> “He’s always giving me tips and advice after all my games, and pointing out things I need to work on to push myself to get to the next level.</p>
      <p> “From my last loans, one of the things I wanted to really work on was my anticipation. I think now I’ve improved on it a lot and it’s not so much of a weakness.</p>
      <p> “The area I’m focusing on now is the aerial side of the game. I want to get more goals from set-pieces so that’s something I’m working on now and Tore helps me with that.”</p>
      <p> The 21-year-old, an English player of Nigeria descent, has scored two goals in nine appearances this season. He has played for England’s U-17 and U-20 teams but still is eligible to play for Nigeria.</p>
