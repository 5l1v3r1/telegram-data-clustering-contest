      <h1>TV Ratings: 'New Amsterdam,' 'This Is Us' Hit Multi-Week Highs</h1>
      <h2>NBC sweeps all three hours of primetime in adults 18-49 on Tuesday.</h2>

      <p>NBC swept all three hours of primetime in adults 18-49, as the final <i>This Is Us</i>Â and <i>New Amsterdam</i> episodes of 2019 both improved and The Voice held steady. The two dramas also scored multi-week highs in total viewers.</p>
      <p><i>This Is Us</i> ended its fall run with a 1.5 rating in adults 18-49, up from 1.4 last week, and 7.27 million viewers, its biggest same-day audience since Oct. 1. <i>New Amsterdam</i> ticked up to 0.8 in the 18-49 demo, and its 5.51 million viewers were the most since its season premiere. (Both shows also score big gains with delayed and multi-platform viewing.) <i>The Voice</i> matched last week's 1.3 demo rating and drew 8.25 million viewers.</p>
      <p>CBS' <i>NCIS</i> retained its title as Tuesday's most-watched show with just over 11 million viewers, along with a 1.0 in adults 18-49 (both are down a little vs. last week). <i>FBI</i> (8.83 million, 0.8) was steady, and <i>NCIS: New Orleans</i> (6.85 million, 0.7) improved week to week in both measures.</p>
      <p>ABC's lineup stayed on the low side of their season averages, with rookie drama <i>Emergence</i> hitting same-day lows of 0.4 in adults 18-49 and 2.3 million viewers (numbers that will likely double after a week of delayed viewing). <i>The Conners</i> (1.0 in the 18-49 demo), <i>Bless This Mess</i> (0.6) and <i>Mixed-ish</i> (0.6) were all steady, and <i>Black-ish</i> improved a little to 0.6.</p>
      <p><i>The Resident</i> improved slightly in adults 18-49 on Fox, posting a 0.8. <i>Empire</i> held at 0.7. On The CW, <i>The Flash</i> improved a bit on its last outing with a 0.5, and <i>Arrow</i> was steady at 0.2.</p>
      <p>NBC's 1.2 rating in adults 18-49 led the night, holding a 50 percent advantage over the 0.8 for second-place CBS. Fox came in third at 0.7, followed by ABC at 0.6. The CW averaged 0.4.</p>
