      <h1>Jose Mourinho: New Tottenham manager claimed Amazon Prime documentary ‘lacked class’</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese was not complimentary when Manchester City announced their collaboration with the on demand streaming giant last year</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a>’s comments on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a>’s collaboration with Amazon Prime could come back to haunt him after being announced as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a> manager.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/mourinho-spurs-manager-jose-tottenham-pochettino-levy-sacked-a9210066.html">replaces Mauricio Pochettino to end his exile from the game since being sacked by Manchester United last year.</a></p>
      <p>Mourinho once criticised Manchester City for running a documentary of their season with Amazon, but will now have to contend with the invasion of privacy at Spurs, who have a similar deal to cover the current campaign.</p>
      <p>“You can be a rich club and buy all the best players in the world but you cannot buy class,” Mourinho said last year after City’s commercial deal with on demand streaming service.</p>
      <p>“Because I am in the movie I could ask for some royalties.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy, announcing Mourinho’s arrival, said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>“He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached.</p>
      <p>“We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
