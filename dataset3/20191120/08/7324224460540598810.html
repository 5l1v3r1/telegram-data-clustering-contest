      <h1>Racheal Kneller rides to the rescue after Twitter plea</h1>
      <h2>Wolverhampton jockey Racheal Kneller answered a desperate owner’s plea to win the Flat Jockeys Can Jump Handicap Hurdle on Ruacana at Lingfield.</h2>

      <p>With booked jockey Trevor Whelan unable to get to the Surrey course because his flight was cancelled, owner Vaughan Lewis took to Twitter in the hope of finding a replacement in time.</p>
      <p>Kneller came to the rescue by dashing to Lingfield and taking the ride on the Zoe Davison-trained 10-year-old.</p>
      <p>And it was well worth it as she landed her first success of 2019 after 35 winless rides on the Flat.</p>
      <p>Ruacana was carrying a 7lb penalty for winning at the track a week ago – but it proved no burden. Kneller had Ruacana close to the pace set by Flaminger before leading from the third-last flight and, though that rival tried to rally, the 13-8 favourite kept on strongly to win by 10 lengths.</p>
      <p>“That was great fun. He jumped well. He was a schoolmaster – he met everything perfect and I was just a passenger. He was an absolute superstar,” said Kneller, of Lower Penn.</p>
      <p>“I said I ought to go jumping. I had a McDonald’s on the way here and these (higher) weights are much better!</p>
      <p>“I had a chocolate milkshake on the way there and I’ll be having champagne when I get home!”</p>
      <p>Kneller had ridden out two lots of horses yesterday morning and was oblivious to the plea from Lewis until she checked her phone.</p>
      <p>Despite an hour-and-a-half drive from Lambourn, Berkshire, Kneller still had time to squeeze in some research.</p>
      <p>She watched video replays of Ruacana’s previous runs on her phone while walking the track, and rang former jump jockey-turned trainer Jamie Osborne for advice.</p>
      <p>“He said keep one leg either side! But then he gave me some really good advice and it all helped,” she said.</p>
      <p>Lewis added: “She should probably take out a jumps’ licence. She gave him a peach of a ride, brilliant stuff.</p>
      <p>“He only ran last week. He looked in good form and this ground is ideal for him. Two miles is probably a bit short, but he showed his class. It’s fantastic for the stable.</p>
      <p>“They’ve done an unbelievable job with him. It’s great for Zoe and the team, brilliant for them.</p>
