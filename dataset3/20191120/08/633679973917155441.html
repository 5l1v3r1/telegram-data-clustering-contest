      <p>KZN police have confirmed that the person arrested on suspicion of murdering a Tongaat woman is her 13-year-old granddaughter.</p>
      <p>The 63-year-old Fairbreeze resident was found bludgeoned to death in her home on Monday.</p>
      <p>The woman's grandchild told police at the time that she was hanging clothes on the line outside when she heard her grandmother's screams.</p>
      <p>The girl said she ran inside the house to find a man, armed with a hammer, attacking her granny.</p>
      <p>She claimed she tried to intervene but the man pushed her out of the house and locked the door.</p>
      <p>The police's Thembeka Mbele says detectives found that the girl's statement did not add up and she reportedly confessed to her mother.</p>
      <p>She says the child will appear in court soon and is currently in custody.</p>
