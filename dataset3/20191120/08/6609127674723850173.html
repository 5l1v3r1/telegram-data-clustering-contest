        <b>RANGERS star Alfredo Morelos missed a golden opportunity as Colombia defeated Ecuador.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Light Blues</a> striker played the first 45 minutes as Carlos Queiroz's men secured back-to-back 1-0 wins.</p>

      <p>Mateus Uribe scored the games only goal early in the second half - but <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4974731/rangers-alfredo-morelos-st-etienne/">Morelos</a> should have found the net in the 26 minute.</p>
      <p>The hitman capitalised on a defensive error that sent him one-on-one with Ecuador goalie Johan Padilla.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old tried to give the keeper the eyes as he sent his effort near post, but the stopper was able to get down and turn his effort around the post.</p>
      <p>Colombia had several opportunities to extend their advantage in the second period but were denied by the Ecuador No1.</p>

      <p>Morelos broke his international duck on Friday night against Peru and it was a typical striker's finish, in what was a proud moment for the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p>It was his 23rd goal of the season in all competitions as his hot-red club form continued on the international stage.</p>
      <p>Speaking of his pride at netting his first Colombia goal, he said: "The goal was just intuition on my part, but it feels great to score my first ever goal for my country especially so late in the game.</p>

      <p>"It's always a huge honour to play for my country and I feel very proud I was able to score too.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't the best game in the world, but the important thing was to get the win.</p>
      <p>"I have always said it was important for me to score my country and it's another step on what has been a great season for me so far at Rangers.</p>
      <p>"And now I have scored my first goal, I hope to go on and score many, many more."</p>
      <p>He will now return to club duty with Steven Gerrard's men travelling to Hamilton Accies on Sunday as they look to keep the pressure on Old Firm rivals <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic. </a></p>
      <p>The Hoops currently lead the Premiership table by one goal.</p>
