      <h1>Ex-Worker at U.K. Consulate in Hong Kong Says China Tortured Him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:21:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">Amy Qin</a></address>
      <p>BEIJING — A former employee of Britain’s consulate in Hong Kong said on Wednesday that the Chinese secret police tortured and beat him, deprived him of sleep and hung him in a spread-eagled pose for hours as they sought information about what they alleged was foreign interference in the protests that have convulsed the city.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://m.facebook.com/notes/cheng-man-kit/for-the-record-an-enemy-of-the-state/2490959950941845/">statement</a> posted on Facebook, Simon Cheng spoke out publicly for the first time since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/23/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-simon-cheng.html?module=inline">he was detained in early Augus</a>t at the end of a business trip from Hong Kong to mainland China. When he was released after 15 days, the Chinese authorities said Mr. Cheng had confessed to unlawful activities.</p>
      <p>“I deny the arbitrary accusations against me made by the authorities which were obtained through an illegal process, including using torture, threats and coercion,” Mr. Cheng, 29, said in his statement. “I speak out now because the case is relevant to the public interest on knowing the flawed judicial process in mainland China.”</p>
      <p>The British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he had summoned the Chinese ambassador in London to express outrage at what he called “the brutal and disgraceful treatment of Simon in violation of China’s international obligations.”</p>
      <p>“Simon Cheng was a valued member of our team,” Mr. Raab said, according to the Foreign Office. “We were shocked and appalled by the mistreatment he suffered while in Chinese detention, which amounts to torture.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Geng Shuang, criticized the summoning of the ambassador and reiterated an earlier statement by the police in Shenzhen, the mainland city near Hong Kong where Mr. Cheng was held, saying that they had protected his legal rights and that he had confessed to breaking the law.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng’s accusations of extrajudicial torture of a Hong Kong resident could further inflame the protests, which began in June as a demonstration against an unpopular bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland, tapping into deeper concerns in the former British colony about China’s notoriously opaque judicial system. The demonstrations have since morphed into a pitched battle between protesters, the police and the government over the city’s future, and they took a more violent turn this past week as protesters fought off a police siege of a university campus.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng’s account also pointed to a deep belief among Chinese officials that the protests have been organized and backed by foreign powers as part of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/world/asia/china-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">a broader effort to undermine the Chinese Communist Party</a>. Mr. Cheng worked on the consulate’s business-development team.</p>
      <p>There has been no concrete evidence of direct foreign interference in the protests. But the Chinese authorities have latched onto statements of support from politicians as evidence of a wider conspiracy. That view received a boost on Tuesday when the United States Senate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/world/asia/senate-bill-hong-kong-protests.html?module=inline">passed a bill</a> that could authorize Washington to impose sanctions on Chinese and Hong Kong officials responsible for human rights abuses in the territory.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng’s account of his experience in mainland police custody could not be independently verified, but his description closely <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/world/asia/china-forced-confessions-propaganda.html?module=inline">mirrors similar cases</a> in which activists have been pressured to make confessions for propaganda purposes.</p>
      <p>“Rather than finding the truth,” he wrote, “the interrogations are more likely to fulfill and prove their pre-written play by filling in the information they want from the detainees.”</p>
      <p>According to Mr. Cheng’s account, the British consulate general instructed staff earlier in the summer to gather information about the protests, including by joining social media groups and talking to protesters, to evaluate travel alerts and to learn more about the involvement of British citizens.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said he personally supported the movement and had joined several demonstrations, but insisted he did “nothing illegal or illegitimate.” He added that he knew several mainland Chinese protesters and had previously tried to organize a discussion group on topics including Chinese society.</p>
      <p>On Aug. 8, Mr. Cheng traveled to Shenzhen for a business conference. He was detained by uniformed Chinese police officers as he was crossing the border to return to Hong Kong. He said that he was carrying money given to him by the parents of a mainland Chinese protester to pay for legal bills.</p>
      <p>From there, Mr. Cheng wrote, he was sent to Shenzhen by high-speed train and handed over to plainclothes police officers, who photographed him, tried to break into his iPhone and collected his biometric information.</p>
      <p>Then, in Mr. Cheng’s telling, he was strapped into an iron interrogation chair, and the questioning began.</p>
      <p>Throughout the ordeal, officers pressed Mr. Cheng for information about his role and the role of Britain and mainland Chinese in what they called the “riots.”</p>
      <p>For most of the 15-day detention period, Mr. Cheng said he was held in solitary confinement and not allowed to contact relatives or lawyers. His glasses were confiscated. Under threat of violence, he gave up his iPhone password and confessed to soliciting prostitution.</p>
      <p>The harshest interrogations took place outside the detention center, where Mr. Cheng said he was handcuffed, shackled, blindfolded and hooded and driven to a secluded place.</p>
      <p>When he realized torture was a possibility, Mr. Cheng wrote, he told the officers, “I will confess whatever you want, torture is not necessary.”</p>
      <p>“They said it is not torture but ‘training’,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said he was hung for hours in a spread-eagle pose. He was beaten to keep him awake. If he dozed off, he was forced to sing the Chinese national anthem.</p>
      <p>After the police saw the extent of his physical injuries, Mr. Cheng wrote, the physical torture gave way to solitary confinement. He said he also saw other prisoners who he thought were protesters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said he gave the police information under intense pressure, including internal emails from the British Consulate and the names of some protesters. He was also videotaped expressing remorse for soliciting prostitution and betraying the motherland.</p>
      <p>But he said he had refused to confess what the officers wanted: that Britain had helped instigate the riots, that he had been involved in the violence and that he had used his consulate salary to bail out detained mainland Chinese protesters.</p>
      <p>At dawn on Aug. 24, the police escorted Mr. Cheng to the Hong Kong border. He was debriefed by consular officials, who granted him extended paid leave.</p>
      <p>Mr. Cheng said he has since fled Hong Kong to an undisclosed place and is hoping to obtain asylum.</p>
      <p>“I won’t give up the fight for human rights, peace, freedom and democracy for the rest of my life,” he wrote, “no matter the danger, discrimination and retaliation I will face, and no matter how my reputation will be stained, and no matter whether my future would be blacklisted, labeled and ruined.”</p>
