      <h1>New voice for Wanneroo Civic Choir</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:04:51+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler Brown</a></address>
      <p>AFTER 22 years, the Wanneroo Civic Choir has passed the baton to a new music director.</p>
      <p>Taui Pinker (32) has taken the helm for the past few months, farewelling Kent Logie after more than two decades of dedicated and unwavering music leadership.</p>
      <p>Logie is now taking a well-earned rest before establishing a chorale ensemble in 2020.</p>
      <p>Self-taught on piano since age 14, Pinker began his path in music as an organist and chorale accompanist within his faith.</p>
      <p>At 18, he stepped off the piano to try his hand at conducting choirs and work more intensely with vocalists.</p>
      <p>Following a move to Melbourne at age 23, he diversified his skills by becoming the inaugural and principal conductor of the Melbourne Regional Orchestra.</p>
      <p>Back in Perth, he is now one of the resident organists at St Benedict’s Catholic Parish in Applecross and a music director on the community theatre scene.</p>
      <p>Pinker is the sixth music director for Wanneroo Civic Choir since it formed in 1982.</p>

      <p>Audiences can see him in action at the choir’s annual concert at the Alexander Heights Community Centre from 2.45pm this Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>The performance will include a range of general songs and Christmas carols and feature soloists Rachel Monamy and David Wallace, as well as the choir’s own small group of theatre performers.</p>
      <p>“This has been a very eventful and symbolic year for the Wanneroo Civic Choir,” acting president Fay Muir said, with 12 new singers also joining in 2019, taking the membership to 50.</p>
      <p>“This has stretched our supplied uniform resources so fundraising at this year’s concert will go to assisting in the design and purchase of new uniforms.”</p>
      <p>Tickets at the door cost $15 for adults and $5 for school-aged students, including afternoon tea.</p>
      <p>The Wanneroo Civic Choir rehearses on Tuesdays from 7.15pm to 9.15pm at the Alexander Height Community Centre.</p>
      <p>New members are welcome. Call Chez on 0417 942 754 or James on 0459 794 574.</p>
