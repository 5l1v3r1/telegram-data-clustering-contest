      <h1>DJI adds Xbox controller support to a gimbal, because why not?</h1>
      <h2>Why wouldn't you control your camera gimbal with an Xbox controller?</h2>

      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>DJI's Ronin-S gimbal now supports the Xbox One controller.</li>
        <li>DualShock 4 support also added.</li>
        <li>It allows you to control the camera and gimbal with the controller.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In today's edition of unexpected, perhaps slightly strange Xbox-related news, we have DJI swooping in with a <a href="https://forum.dji.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=202408&amp;extra=page%3D1%26filter%3Dtypeid%26typeid%3D664%26typeid%3D664">new firmware</a> for one of its products that adds support for the Xbox One controller. It's also not the one you might have expected.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Essentials-Stabilizer-Mirrorless-CP-RN-00000033-01/dp/B07R88FBRH/?tag=wpcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUwpUdUnU71956YYw">Ronin-S</a> is the company's (somewhat) affordable gimbal system for DSLR and mirrorless cameras, and by all accounts is a pretty impressive piece of kit. I haven't used one, but if it's as good as the company's drones, I'm sure it's killer. And now you can use the best controller around to make life using one a little easier.</p>
      <blockquote>Added support for using PS4 DualShock and Xbox controllers to control the gimbal and camera. Photo capture, video recording, focus, zoom, profile switch, and gimbal movements can be controlled after connecting the controller to the mobile device and gimbal. Enter the Ronin app and select Create, and then open and stay on the Gaming Controller screen when using the PS4 DualShock controller or Xbox controller to control the gimbal. The speed and smoothness of the control sticks can be adjusted. Set the focus value within 10 for optimal performance. iOS 13 or higher, Android 9.0 or higher, and Ronin app v1.2.6 or higher are required.</blockquote>
      <p>Essentially it seems straight forward. You connect the controller to your Android handset or iPhone (Apple added support in iOS 13), and then you're good to go. Oh, and if you're a PS4 owner, you can also use the DualShock 4. It's a pretty neat idea, though I can certainly think of some other DJI products that this would be awesome to see on.</p>
      <p>How about some love for the drones next, huh, DJI?</p>
