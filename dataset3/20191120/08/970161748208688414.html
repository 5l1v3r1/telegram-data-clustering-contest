        <b>After welcoming baby Anaya back in August Alesha Dixon has kept the newborn bub on the down low.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That changed last night when the Britain’s Got Talent judge blessed us with a sneak peak at her little bundle of joy.</p>
      <p>And what a bundle of joy she was!</p>
      <p>Taking to social media on Tuesday night, the 41-year-old shared a snapshot of little Anaya – whom she shares with husband Azuka Ononye – all bundled up in her cot with a giant grin on her face.</p>
      <p>Dubbed a bunny by her mum, perhaps due to her holding a white, plush toy, Alesha shared a series of rabbit emojis alongside the adorable pic.</p>
      <p>Fans immediately flocked to the comments section to coo over the little one, with one excited follower writing: ‘Wow she is a magnificent wee specimen and wow what a smile – so wonderful to see.’</p>

      <p>Strictly’s Oti Mabuse wrote of the likeness to Alesha’s six-year-old daughter: ‘Looks just like Azura.’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, model Jourdan Dunn simply mused: ‘My ovaries!’</p>
      <p>Singer Aston Merrygold wanted a piece of the comment pie, as he added: ‘Oh stop it! Your little twin.’</p>
      <p>And so on and such and such.</p>
      <p>The star revealed earlier this month that she had welcomed her second daughter while she was also doing the filming for the talent show.</p>
      <p>She later confirmed her happy news on Instagram two months after Anaya’s birth, sharing a sweet photo and revealing she was born on 20 August.</p>

      <p>Alesha recently revealed she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/alesha-dixon-feared-losing-americas-got-talent-job-pregnancy-know-im-baby-10967837/">feared she would lose her judging job on America’s Got Talent</a> because of her pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The TV personality was announced as the new judge on AGT in September, joining Simon, Howie Mandel, and Heidi Klum and speaking on Lorraine, Alesha revealed how she feared US network NBC would retract the offer to judge over the pregnancy.</p>
      <p>‘Well I didn’t exactly get the call from Simon [Cowell],’ Alesha said. ‘He doesn’t own a mobile phone anymore.</p>
      <p>‘I actually got the call from NBC which was super flattering and I was pregnant at the time. There were two thoughts, one, “oh my goodness this is incredible of course I want to do it”, and two, “do they know I’m pregnant?”</p>

      <p>‘And they did and that was such a relief that they didn’t see that as an issue.’</p>
