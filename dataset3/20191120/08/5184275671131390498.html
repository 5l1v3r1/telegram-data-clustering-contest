      <p>Earlier Amitabh Bachchan shared a glimpse of the birthday party. Big B took to his blog and penned a lengthy note, sharing how celebrations have changed over time.</p>
      <p>“The child grows up .. and celebrations keep in growth too .. for long have the traditions of the British been kept in place .. that of the cake .. I presume that a cake was a rarity during the time of the inception of this tradition .. so it became a rarity and hence to be brought about on special occasions .. the candle and the number of them for age and its blowing has remained for too long but what be the tradition or history of it…in my and our tradition in this part of the world the blowing of candles is an indication of an end .. here the blowing is an achievement of celebration .. so do we continue or change or what .. we in our family did .. the cake was replaced by a ‘khoye’ ki barfi’ and no candles..are agarbatti jalo , kuch aur karo lekin batti na bujhao,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Aishwarya was last seen in Fanney Khan &amp; Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Her upcoming is Mani Ratnam’s Tamil film, Ponniyin Selvan. Abhishek was last seen in Anurag Kashyap’s Manmarziyaan also starring Vicky Kaushal &amp; Taapsee Pannu.</p>
