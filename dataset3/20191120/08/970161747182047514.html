      <p>K-pop is only just starting to be recognised in the Western charts and awards show, with artists like BTS, BLACKPINK and EXO smashing records.</p>
      <p>And it seems now the movie industry is jumping on the bandwagon</p>
      <p>A K-pop comedy written by Rebel Wilson is in the works, and yup – the internet has some feelings.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/lionsgate-rebel-wilson-k-pop-comedy-seoul-girls-1202790233/">According to Deadline</a>, Lionsgate has obtained the rights to Seoul Girls, which was written by Pitch Perfect star Rebel, who will also have a role in the movie.</p>

      <p>Seoul Girls will follow a Korean American high school student who, along with her friends, decides to enter a global talent competition to be the opening act for the world’s biggest K-pop boyband (three guesses on who that is based on).</p>

      <p>The ‘Seoul Girls’ are given help in their quest to open for BTS – er, no, we mean a totally unrelated boyband – by a former K-pop trainee and a former member of a British girl group.</p>
      <p>We’re getting throwbacks to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/simon-cowell-leaves-k-pop-fans-fuming-x-factor-band-announcement-time-uk-pop-11053312/">Simon Cowell’s UK-pop comments…</a></p>
      <p>While we have no further details on what Seoul Girls will entail, people aren’t exactly enthusiastic about the project.</p>
      <p>The Ringer’s Kate Halliwell tweeted: ‘well there’s no way this could go wrong’, while one person added: ‘Why is this happening and who can I pay to make it stop lmao?’</p>
      <p>And the hits just kept coming:</p>

      <p>In fairness, none of us know what the actual content of the movie will be yet, and many people on Twitter are waiting to see a trailer to give the benefit of the doubt.</p>
      <p>Plus, it has been noted that Rebel’s script has been given a recent revision by Korean screenwriter Young Il Kim, who has tweeted: ‘This will be a fun project. Hope you all see it if/when it comes out. Also, I hope this leads to me getting backstage passes for my kids to a BTS concert or something.’</p>
      <p>He also joked: ‘Years of attending K-CON paid off!</p>
      <p>‘This Kpop project is gonna get me at least a 10% discount in K-town restaurants!’</p>
      <p>Seoul Girls doesn’t yet have a release date.</p>
