        <i>Former Spurs manager will not be kicking his heels for long</i>
      </p>
      <p>A world of infinite possibility has suddenly opened up for <b><s>Tottenham Hotspur</s></b> <b>Mauricio Pochettino</b>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/20/tottenham-hotspur-jose-mourinho-named-new-manager-of-spurs">The former Spurs boss</a> – and yes it does feel strange suddenly saying that – is unlikely to be kicking his heels for long. <b>Bayern Munich</b> currently have an interim manager in the shape of Hans-Dieter Flick, while Zinedine Zidane and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s coats hang on a shoogly peg at <b>Real Madrid</b> and<b> Manchester United</b> respectively. Ears will be pricking up all over the shop. There’s also been talk of <b>Arsenal</b> and <b>Barcelona</b>, but, again respectively, come off it and come on.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile as the clock starts ticking on José Mourinho’s return to Old Trafford – he’ll take Tottenham there in 14 days and 10 hours, give or take – expect the new man in N17 to start making changes. And make them FAST. “The quality in the academy excites me,” he trills. And what’s this? A rumour linking 17-year-old striking prospect <b>Troy Parrott</b> with a move to <b>Bayern Munich</b>. It all starts here.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester United</b> also fancy a new young striker. They’ll either stump up £85m for Red Bull Salzburg sensation <b>Erling Braut Haaland</b>, or make off with Reading’s <b>Danny Loader</b> on a free.</p>
      <p>Manchester City are desperate to keep hold of <b>Raheem Sterling</b>. They’ll offer to bump his weekly wage up to £375,000 a week, giving him Premier League parity with David de Gea. Whether that puts an end to interest from <b>Real Madrid</b> and <b>Barcelona</b> is anybody’s guess.</p>
      <p><b>Chelsea</b> are keeping an eye on Nice right-back-cum-winger <b>Youcef Atal</b>.</p>
      <p>And finally ... <b>Gareth Bale</b> to return to <b>Tottenham Hotspur</b>. Someone’s going to raise the possibility of this marquee signing for Mourinho sooner or later, so we might as well get the ball rolling now.</p>
