      <h1>38% of homeless children have mental health or behavioural disorders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:23:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>38% of homeless children have significant mental health or behavioural disorders.</p>
      <p>That is according to a new study by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.</p>
      <p>It is calling for the government to act now to prevent so many children experiencing homelessness or inadequate housing.</p>
      <p>Dr Julie Heslin, the lead author, says this causes a serious impact on children's health</p>
      <p>"Research would seem that the type of illness that they experience includes depression anxiety, behavioural problems," said Dr Heslin.</p>
      <p>"And then for the younger child, occasionally, developmental delay.</p>
      <p>"It impacts on younger children but also up to adolescents."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, St Vincent de Paul said it is expecting more than 60,000 calls for help this winter from families in need.</p>
      <p>The charity is launching its annual appeal today ahead of what it says is its busiest time of the year.</p>
      <p>It says this year's focus is on helping children, particularly the almost 4,000 in emergency accommodation around the country.</p>
