      <p>Governor Emeka Ihedioha of Imo State has described his victory at the Appeal Court judgment as a reaffirmation of confidence in the judicial system.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported that the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/19/imo-guber-appeal-court-gives-judgement-on-suits-against-ihedioha/">Court of Appeal in Abuja upheld the judgement</a> of the Imo State Governorship Tribunal which affirmed the election of Ihedioha.</p>
      <p>The court on Tuesday delivered the judgment following an appeal filed by the Action Alliance (AA), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), and the All Progressives Congress (APC), challenging the election of the PDP candidate.</p>
      <p>The appellants told the court that Ihedioha did not obtain the constitutionally required one-quarter of votes cast in at least, two-thirds of the 27 local government areas of the state. They, therefore, urged the court to dismiss the decision of the tribunal and declare them the winner of the election or order a rerun. But the appellate court dismissed the appeal for lack of merit.</p>
      <p>However, reacting to the verdict, governor Ihedioha appreciated the people of the state and the PDP party faithful for their prayers throughout the legal battle. He also said that the verdict has vindicated the mandate given to him by the people of the state.</p>
      <p>“The learned justices once again vindicated the mandate delivered to us by the good people of Imo State. We also tender our gratitude to the good people of Imo State, the PDP party faithful and our teeming supporters for your prayers, solidarity, and faith all through the process of the election petitions tribunal hearings and subsequent appeal.</p>
      <p>“Their judgement today has reaffirmed our confidence in our judicial system.”</p>
      <h3>Ihedioha appeal to opposition</h3>
      <p>Ihediohia also called on the opposition in the state to join hands with him and develop Imo state.</p>
      <p>“The Rebuild Imo Agenda is on course. I bear none of my adversaries no ill will. I harbour neither bitterness nor rancour. Just as I am, without any other plea than my earlier invitation that they should come and together, let us Rebuild Imo State.</p>
      <p>“While I affirm that the effort is a collective one, I am not unmindful that there would be opposition on our path. But with God on our side, we shall rise above every mountain of antagonism, overcome layers of impediments and cross every Rubicon to deliver to our people quality infrastructure, functional welfare amenities and a prosperous economy.</p>
      <p>“During the electioneering campaigns, I did assure our people that Imo State, under my watch would stand firmly on the rule of law. Indeed, this judgement today, once again, has strengthened our resolve to be guided by this solemn promise.”</p>
