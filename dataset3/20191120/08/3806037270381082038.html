      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/consequence">Consequence</a> is celebrating the legacy of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/phife-dawg">Phife Dawg</a> with “No Place Like Home,” a tribute single that features a guest verse from <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2016/3/a-tribe-called-quest-phife-dawg-dead">the late legend</a>. Released on what would have been the 5 Foot Assassin’s 49th birthday, Consequence revealed that their collaborative track was created at the beginning of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/a-tribe-called-quest">A Tribe Called Quest</a>‘s final record, <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/2016/11/a-tribe-called-quest-we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service-album-stream">We Got It From Here…Thank You 4 Your Service</a></i>.</p>
      <p>“Even though he was living in The Bay during the last years of his life, we kept in touch frequently and I even brought my son, Caiden, to meet him in person while he was in New York; which lead to both of us making a cameo appearance in his last solo video,” he said in a statement. “A couple of months later Phife, unfortunately, passed away and Q Tip asked me to re-join Tribe to help make sure the last LP represented us and Phife’s legacy to the fullest. Once we released ‘We Got It From Here, Thank You 4 Your Service’ I always knew I wanted people to hear this record, but it just felt like the timing had to be right. This year it feels right…”</p>
      <p>He ends his statement with a birthday greeting for the beloved rapper, offering “No Place Like Home” as his birthday gift. “The one thing I know about Phife is that he’s a rapper’s rapper. The best gift I could give him for his birthday this year is to let the world hear the “5 Foot Assassin” 1nce Again,” Consequence wrote. “Happy Birthday Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor. Love Cons, Deisha, Mom, Dad and all The Questers Worldwide!”</p>
