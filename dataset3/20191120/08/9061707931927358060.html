      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach</a></address>
      <p>The wait for Wayne Rooney's arrival at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> is almost at an end.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/wayne-rooney">England's all-time leading goalscorer</a> can pull on a Rams jersey from the January 2 meeting with Barnsley - and he has already trained with the first team at Moor Farm.</p>
      <p>His long-awaited Championship spell will see him compete in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/football-league-championship">England's second tier</a> for the first time -but what have he, his peers and the key Derby figures said about Rooney's imminent arrival?</p>
      <h4>Wayne Rooney</h4>
      <p>"The opportunity to come back here and play and take the next transition in my career was one factor," said Rooney, who has signed an 18-month deal.</p>
      <p>"I will keep playing until my body says I can't any more. I feel good.</p>
      <p>"We've got four young boys and certainly for my oldest it is a crucial time in his schooling," he added. "[But] it wasn't just about coming home.</p>

      <p>"I had a decision to make and the decision to come and play here in England and develop as a coach with [Derby manager] Phillip Cocu was too good to turn down.</p>
      <p>"Firstly, I'm a player and feel I have a lot of quality to bring to the squad. But, secondly, I want to learn from Phillip and his staff to gain experience for when I take the next step."</p>
      <h4>Philip Cocu</h4>
      <p>"If you look at our team, I think what we need is this type of a character and player who is involved in how we think as coaches and as a manager, how we want to play and how to keep the team together in certain periods of the game.</p>
      <p>"For example, at Hull (where Derby lost 2-0), the last part of the game when we conceded, I think we can avoid it when we have somebody who has a lot of experience.</p>

      <p>"He (Rooney) can reach other players during the game, and that is one of the most difficult things in football.</p>
      <p>"I think it will be very helpful in many ways - for the team, for the young players, for us as coaches and manager - to have a player who can be the link between the players and the way we like to work and play.</p>
      <p>"His influence during the games can be a very important part as well as his quality as a football player."</p>
      <h4>Stephen Warnock - ex-Rams defender</h4>
      <p>“I don’t think he’ll struggle at all. You only have to look at DC United. When he went in there they were struggling, they hadn’t won a game in a long time. He went in, set the standards in and around the training ground," he told talkSPORT.</p>
      <p>“There was a story very early on, on his first or second day, he told people to do their work better, standards needed to be higher.</p>
      <p>"So, I think that’s what you get from players who’ve played at a world class level and played at the level he’s played at, they’re infectious in what they do in setting high standards and they expect others to be the same as well.</p>
      <p>"So, I don’t think that’ll be an issue for him.</p>

      <p>“I think he’s gone over to America and proven that he’s still very fit and still very hungry," said the former Liverpool, Aston Villa and England full-back.</p>
      <p>“He’s at a stage in his career where he knows he can play in a deeper lying role. But he’s even shown out in America that he can still play up top and still score and assist plenty of goals too.</p>
      <p>“So, from Derby’s point of view to have him there on the pitch is a massive asset in the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to embrace him coming in and you’ve got to want to give him the ball. You’ve got to want to learn off him in training, watch what he does in training.</p>
      <p>"Listen to him because he’ll know things that other players won’t know, especially the younger lads, so he’ll have a voice for them. You’ve got to listen to people like Wayne.”</p>
      <h4>Mel Morris - Derby County owner</h4>
      <p>"It is a fantastic opportunity for the club. I think also for Wayne too.</p>
      <p>"He is keen to finish his playing career at some points and to transition into management so it is an opportunity for us to get a world class player in to help on the grass but also to help with a coach.</p>
      <p>"He will join on an 18-month contract with the option for the club to extend for a further year.</p>

      <p>"His coaching will continue. Wayne is very keen to accelerate the rest of his coaching badges and I think a big part of this was the attraction to work along side Philip Cocu."</p>
      <p>He continued: "I think the time that Frank (Lampard) had here has been extremely valuable to us. We loved the season with Frank and we would have loved to have had another one.</p>
      <p>"We handled the situation of his move to Chelsea by wishing him the best, which was very heartfelt, and I think that show the world how we are very people centric and that has had a big impact on Wayne.</p>
      <p>"Before Frank maybe this wouldn't have happened and I think getting Philip Cocu on board was vital.</p>
      <p>"If you want to be a coach then you want to work with someone with a brilliant track record."</p>
