      <h1>Arsenal: Kieran Tierney super friends not a coincidence</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal newbie Kieran Tierney has highlighted his group of friends at the club, and not surprisingly, they might as well be called the super friends.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:00:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>While most <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> fans don’t find a lot of joy coming from the club these days, there’s still a lot to be excited about. Namely, we have a lot of good young players, some of whom we haven’t even seen the best of yet. Among them is <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/fce2302c/Kieran-Tierney?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Kieran Tierney</a>.</p>
      <p>Tierney recently opened up about his support group when he first arrived at the club and you may see a theme developing among this circle (square?) of friends. They are <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/f874dd44/Hector-Bellerin?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Hector Bellerin</a>, <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d79a8c87/Rob-Holding?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Rob Holding</a>, and <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/00963611/Konstantinos-Mavropanos?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Konstantinos Mavropanos</a>.</p>
      <p>Add Kieran Tierney to that list and what do you have? A damn exciting, young, talented back line that I would rather see starting than anything we’ve used so far.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the big similarity between these four is that they were all injured at the same time, and thus they were in the recovering room together. How Dinos got hurt again, I don’t know, but that’s besides the point.</p>
      <p>What <i>isn’t</i> besides the point is that all of those young defenders have at one time or another—and mostly still are—regarded as the future of this defense. So if I start referring to a collective of individuals as “the Super Friends,” you’ll know who I mean. It’s these guys right here.</p>
      <p>Many fans are talking up the need for more defensive help in the coming transfer windows, but when you look at the Super Friends and add in <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/dc6f5bdd/Calum-Chambers?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Calum Chambers</a> and <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/972aeb2a/William-Saliba?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">William Saliba</a>, I am just fine letting the seeds grow into full on sequoias. It beats taking another gamble on another centerback who is going to have to acclimate, who we don’t know for sure. These are guys, bar Saliba, who have grown in the club, proven their mettle, and proven that all they really need is more time to be at the same level as some of these targets anyway.</p>
      <p>Now we just have to keep hold of all of these guys for the long haul so we can all remember that they were BFFs on the operating table.</p>
      <p>It’s charming to hear about chemistry developing inside of the team when so little is seen on the surface at times. This may seem like a nonfactor, but I’ll take stories all day about friendships at the club rather than the alternative.</p>
