      <p>As part of the agreement, the British mobile company will help Europe's biggest budget airline to speed up the time it takes to connect a new airport or site for use. It should also lead to a faster turnaround of planes.</p>
      <p>"Airline passengers will demand even more in the coming years, and we will work alongside Ryanair to help them prepare for the future using our full portfolio of products and services," said Vinod Kumar, head of Vodafone Business.</p>
