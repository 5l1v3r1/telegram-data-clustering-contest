      <h1>Unai Emery becomes favourite for sack as Jose Mourinho takes over at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino became the second manager to be sacked on Tuesday night and it leaves Arsenal's Unai Emery as the new favourite to face the axe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:29:58+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:29</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is now the man leading the sack race after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> axed Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The north London clubs have both struggled so far this season with Daniel Levy the first chief to take the plunge.</p>
      <p>He has acted quickly by hiring Jose Mourinho as head coach in a sensational move.</p>
      <p>But it now leaves Emery as the man most likely to be axed in the coming weeks following a run of two wins in ten Premier League games.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was allowed to spend over Â£100m in the summer, but hasn't been able to turn that investment into points.</p>

      <p>A defeat at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> last time out leaves them nine-points off the Champions League places and, given that was Emery's remit, he is under pressure to turn things around.</p>
      <p>The former Sevilla and PSG boss has also come in for criticism for some off his decisions off the field with the appointment of Granit Xhaka as captain creating more problems than it solved.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been linked with the Emirates hot seat in recent weeks, but he is now out of the running after making an incredible return on the white half of north London.</p>

      <p>Emery has only been in charge at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> for just over a year having succeeded Arsene Wenger following his lengthy tenure.</p>
      <p>But there are calls from the Gunners fans to see the Europa League winner sacked with several candidates linked.</p>
      <p>Manchester City's assistant manager Mikel Arteta, who played for Arsenal, was linked with the job before Emery took over and is still a possibility.</p>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers, who has masterminded Leicester's upturn in fortunes, is another name to be thrown into the mix.</p>
