      <h1>Tottenham Hotspur appoints José Mourinho as manager</h1>
      <h2>Move follows sacking of Mauricio Pochettino who led club to Champions League final last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:13:31+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:13</time> by <a rel="author">Murad Ahmed</a></address>
      <p>José Mourinho has been appointed as manager of Tottenham Hotspur, a day after the English Premier League football club fired Mauricio Pochettino who led the team to its<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9ede30d0-84c1-11e9-a028-86cea8523dc2"> first ever</a> Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>The London-based team announced the move on Tuesday night, following a poor run of results that left it in 14th place in English football’s top tier. This has left Tottenham at risk of failing to qualify for next season’s Champions League, Europe’s most prestigious club tournament where participating clubs share in more than €2bn in prize money. </p>
      <p>“We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste,” said club chairman Daniel Levy in a statement. </p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing. </p>
      <p>“It falls to the board to make the difficult decisions — this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff — but we do so in the club’s best interests.”</p>
      <p>Mr Mourinho is one of the most successful managers of his generation, having won the Champions League with Portugal’s Porto and Italy’s Inter Milan, as well as three English Premier League titles with Chelsea. Such victories have led the Portuguese coach to describe himself as “the special one”.</p>
      <p>However, his last posting at Manchester United ended in acrimony, unable to return the team to its past dominance in England and with players appearing to lose faith in his methods.</p>

      <p>“In José we have one of the most successful managers in football,” said Mr Levy. “He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>“I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters,” said Mr Mourinho. “The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Appointed five years ago, Mr Pochettino led Tottenham to qualify for the Champions League in the past four seasons. The team lost in last year’s final to Premier League rivals Liverpool. </p>

      <p>Strong on-pitch results over recent years have also led to steady growth in revenues from broadcasting and prize money. Over the 2017-18 season, the latest period in which financial results are available, Tottenham achieved £380.7m in revenues with pre-tax profits of £138.9m — the largest annual profit of any football club in history. </p>

      <p>However, an underlying tension at the club has been Mr Levy’s reluctance to spend heavily in the transfer market to support a major rebuilding of the playing squad led by Mr Pochettino, who has been left frustrated at falling agonisingly short of winning the sport’s top prizes. </p>
      <p>In September, Mr Levy <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b5931cd8-da1a-11e9-8f9b-77216ebe1f17">told</a> the Financial Times he had secured the financial future of the club by refinancing £600m of debt related to the building of its new North London stadium. But he added there would be no change to the frugal business plan instituted during his nearly two decades running the club. </p>
      <p>“We could have easily spent more money on players,” said Mr Levy at the time. “Who knows if that would have bought us more success or not . . . The right approach is to build from the bottom up. There is no quick fix to becoming a much more significant global club.”</p>
