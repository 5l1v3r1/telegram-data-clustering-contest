        <b>All Bar One and Miller &amp; Carter owner Mitchells &amp; Butlers is gearing up to launch new sites in Scotland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having already established its Miller &amp; Carter steakhouse brand in key city sites, the next stage of the expansion will focus on more new build, out-of-town opportunities involving a site purchase, or buying an existing business.</p>

      <p>John Menzies, a director in the national retail team at property agency Savills in Glasgow, which is advising the pub and restaurant giant, said: “The licensed sector is proving resilient in the current market and best-in-class operators with a strong and differentiated offer are seeking to grow.</p>
      <p>“There are now five Miller &amp; Carter steakhouse restaurants in Scotland, across Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. The format is proving versatile for the business with all the existing restaurants trading well.</p>
      <p>“The business is now seeking new opportunities to grow the brand further with particular interest in busy roadside locations.”</p>
      <p>News of the Scottish growth plans came as Mitchells &amp; Butlers hailed a “strong” year after investment across its sites helped to boost sales despite “challenging” conditions in the sector.</p>
      <p>The company, which also runs scores of well-known Scottish watering holes including Edinburgh’s historic Sheep Heid Inn, saw like-for-like sales jump 3.5 per cent in the year to September, as total revenues rose to £2.23 billion. It saw pre-tax profit for the year increase, rising by 36 per cent to £177 million.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Growth</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the owner of Toby Carvery and pub chains Nicholson’s and O’Neill’s said sales growth has eased to 1.4 per cent for the most recent seven weeks due to poor weather.</p>
      <p>The group said it had been boosted by its programme of investment into refurbishments, with 240 of its 1,748 pubs being “remodelled” during the year.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Phil Urban said: “These strong results reflect the work we have done over the last few years, first to build sustained sales growth and then to convert that into profit growth.</p>
      <p>“It has been extremely encouraging to see an improvement in like-for-like sales growth across the portfolio during the year, fuelled by our ‘Ignite’ programme of work. This puts us in a stronger position as we move forward into the next financial year, in what we expect to remain challenging market conditions.”</p>
