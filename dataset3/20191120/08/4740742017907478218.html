      <h1>Six players linked with Bristol City in the summer and what happened next</h1>
      <h2>City were linked with numerous names in the summer and Johnson is in the market ahead of January</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:00:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>It is no secret that Bristol City remain in the market for a forward ahead of the January transfer window, as Lee Johnson looks to bolster his attack for a playoff push.</p>
      <p>Injury problems have restricted the Robins' depth in the final third and the club also had to endure the frustration of missing out on Arsenal loanee Eddie Nketiah, who moved to Leeds United.</p>
      <p>Those wounds are unlikely to have healed given the bit-part role Nketiah has played at Elland Road, with the general consensus being that he would have got more first-team action at Ashton Gate.</p>
      <p>It wasn't the attackers linked with a move to join Johnson's side in the summer though, as plenty of other names were churned out during the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Naturally, this is likely to occur once again in the New Year when the January transfer window opens for business and some of the names touted could even be revivals of transfer candidates earlier this year.</p>
      <p>But who were the players that were linked to City and what happened next? We've taken a look at half a dozen of the players linked with a summer transfer here.</p>
      <h3>Anfernee Dijksteel</h3>
      <p>Charlton boss Lee Bowyer revealed during the summer that Bristol City were in the hunt for full-back Anferee Dijksteel and, although the owner stated the defender was not for sale, he did complete a transfer.</p>
      <p>Instead of heading to Ashton Gate though, Dijksteel moved to join Jonathan Woodgate's Middlesbrough and he has been a regular on Teesside, making 10 Championship appearances.</p>
      <p>However, he has endured somewhat of a dip in recent weeks as he spent three games an an unused substitute prior to returning to the starting line up against Derby County, playing 55 minutes.</p>
      <p>Prior to the international break, he was back on the bench again for the 2-2 draw with QPR but this time managed to get a run out, playing 25 minutes of that clash.</p>

      <h3>Ciaran Clark</h3>
      <p>Bristol City, along with Crystal Palace, were keen on Republic of Ireland international Ciaran Clark during the summer transfer window but new Newcastle United manager Steve Bruce refused to part ways with the defender.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old would have likely been frustrated with that stance as the first few weeks of the season saw him either sit on the bench as an unused substitute or miss out on the squad entirely.</p>
      <p>However, the picture started to change when Clark played the entirety of the 1-0 victory over Manchester United in October and he hasn't missed a single minute of Premier League action since.</p>
      <p>On top of that, Clark headed into the international break in an unlikely vein of scoring form after netting in the victories over West Ham and Bournemouth.</p>
      <h3>Milad Mohammadi</h3>
      <p>Available on a free transfer in the summer after his deal with Russian Premier League side Akhmat Grozny came to a close, Milad Mohammadi was linked with a host of clubs across Britain and Europe.</p>
      <p>Joining Bristol City in the hunt for the services of the Iran international were Celtic and Fulham, among others, and signed for Belgian side Gent - which has allowed him to play in the Europa League this season.</p>
      <p>On the continental stage, his sole appearance came in the second round of qualifying, as the 26-year-old has been an unused substitute in all of Gent's group-stage matches so far.</p>
      <p>It has been a similar story in the league, as Mohammadi has featured just six times out of a possible 14 for the side currently sat second in the Belgian Pro League behind Club Brugge.</p>

      <h3>David Turnbull</h3>
      <p>Bristol City received a boost in the hunt for the services of Motherwell midfielder David Turnbull in the summer when Celtic pulled the plug on a Â£3m move.</p>
      <p>It was revealed by the Scottish champions that they had been unable to agree terms with the 19-year-old's representatives and, as a result, Turnbull remained at Motherwell.</p>
      <p>However, he has been unable to kick on this season due to injury and is aiming to return to competitive action in the New Year, where he'll look to build upon his spectacular form last term.</p>
      <p>In 30 Scottish Premiership appearances during the 2018-19 campaign, Turnbull notched an impressive 15 goals and provided a further four assists to his team-mates.</p>
      <h3>Conor Wickham</h3>
      <p>Out of favour at Crystal Palace, the 26-year-old striker was linked with Stoke City and Bristol City during the summer window but a move for either failed to materialise.</p>
      <p>Since then, there has been no improvement in Wickham's playing time at Selhurst Park as he has picked up just two Premier League appearances, as well as playing one game in the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>Also yet to open his account this term, it is highly likely that Wickham's services will be speculated upon during the January transfer window and a move to the Championship could help to rejuvenate the striker's career.</p>
      <p>During four years in South London, Wickham has accumulated just 37 Premier League appearances with a return of seven goals.</p>

      <h3>Kieffer Moore</h3>
      <p>After hitting 19 goals for Barnsley in League One last term to help the Tykes seal promotion to the Championship, Kieffer Moore was hot property and Bristol City were among the clubs vying for his services.</p>
      <p>In the end, it was Wigan Athletic who won the race for his signature but he has so far been unable to offer the same sort of return in the final third, netting just a solitary goal so far in his Championship exploits.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old has been far more effective on the international stage as he has played a key role in Wales' push to secure a spot in next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p>In October, he scored his first goal for his nation in a 1-1 draw with Slovakia and followed that up last week by opening the scoring against Azerbaijan, keeping Ryan Giggs' side of automatic qualification alive.</p>
