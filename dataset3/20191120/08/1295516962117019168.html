      <h1>Star Wars: The Mandalorian Creator Reveals Adorable Baby Yoda Concept Art</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:11:41+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bea Caicoya</a></address>
      <p>Jon Favreau, the creator and showrunner ofÂ  <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a>: <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a></i> series on Disney+, has <a href="https://twitter.com/Jon_Favreau/status/1196909243703578624">shared</a> the original concept art of Baby Yoda, known as "The Asset" on the show, and "The Child" to fans.</p>
      <p><i>The Mandalorian</i>, Disney+'s first live-action <i>Star Wars</i> series, is heavily inspired by the samurai and Spaghetti Western genres, but with a sci-fi twist. The first two episodes of the series introduce audiences to the titular character, a Mandalorian bounty hunter with the reputation of being able to catch and deliver any target. When The Client (Werner Herzog), a futuristic mob boss type that talks and acts like a powerful remnant of the fallen Empire, offers Mando an extremely well-paid commission that would immensely help him and his entire community, he cannot refuse. He's to retrieve a 50-year old fugitive and bring it back to the Client and his partner, Doctor Pershing.</p>

      <p>Mando finds the Asset under heavy protection in the desert planet of Arvala-7, and finds that more than one bounty hunter is on the job. While he's more than happy to negotiate a split payment, his cool professionalism wavers when he sees that the Asset, despite being 50 years old, is a toddler from the same unknown species as Yoda, with whom he immediately establishes an almost paternal connection. Episode 2, <i>The Child</i>, explores the reason why Baby Yoda is so important; despite his tiny size and wobbly walk, Baby Yoda is already strong in the Force and able to stop a space rhinoceros' charge mid-air (though afterwards he might need a nap.)</p>

      <p>Baby Yoda has been a massive success with <i>Star Wars</i> fans across the board, to the point where it became impossible to avoid spoilers for <i>The Mandalorian</i>. <i>Star Wars</i>, leaning into the good reception of the Child, officially revealed his existence on their official social media channels. Soon after, even more <a href="https://twitter.com/themandalorian/status/1196953065934348289">concept art by Nick Gindraux</a> has also been released.</p>
