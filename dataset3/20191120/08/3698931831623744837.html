      <h1>Lazada sold over 1 million items within the 1st hour of 11.11 sale, breaking 2018 sales record in 13 hours</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:42:09+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/sponsored/" target="_blank">Sponsored</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/11-11">11.11</a> sale has just ended, and e-commerce platforms like Lazada went into overdrive with the sheer number of transactions happening over the 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Lazada has announced that they have broken their 2018 11.11. sales record in just 13 hours. More than 1 million items have been sold within the first hour of the sale, and Lazada says that they delivered the first parcel of the 11.11 sale to a customer at 1:20AM.</p>
      <p>This, according to the e-commerce company, is a new regional record—the first delivery being made within 80 minutes.</p>

      <p>Lazada also says that the Lazada Wallet was the highest-used payment option during the 24-hour sale, with their rate of transactions per minute increasing by more than 50% as compared to 2018. For some perspective, this is a 77% increase over 2018 for transactions per second via the Lazada Wallet.</p>
      <p>The sale was certainly highly-anticipated, with the #MYLazada1111 becoming one of the trending hashtags for 48 hours. Meanwhile, the Lazada 11.11 Super Show was held for the second year running, with a live television special running in collaboration with Media Prima Television Networks. The program was streamed on the Lazada mobile app and broadcasted on TV3, along with Tonton and YouTube. During the countdown to the sale, Malaysian and international stars (including K-pop group, Apink) performed, with a total audience of nearly 5 million across multiple platforms.</p>

      <p>In addition to that, Lazada had a Lowest Price Guarantee promotion on all of their products during 11.11—if there was an identical, in-stock, non-promotional product on another online store with a lower regular selling price, Lazada paid customers two times the difference.</p>
      <p>Other highlights of the Lazada 11.11 Shopping Festival include Moji-Go, Lazada’s first in-app facial recognition game, along with a Stamp Hunt—QR codes at 800 participating outlets in Malaysia were scanned by customers to earn even more rewards and vouchers.</p>

      <p>The impressive numbers didn’t come without its fair share of hard toil and effort, with Lazada eLogistics (LeL) increasing manpower by 5 times, and 8 of their warehouses were in operation for 24 hours over 6 days. Among the best-sellers during the sale was the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (which was available for RM1,699), which sold out within the first 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>And in a matter that’s closer to home, the 11.11 Shopping Festival also showed that more Malaysians from all backgrounds are participating in the digital economy. The Desaku LazMall Flagship Store on Lazada sold out their products in less than 24 hours—the store aims to help create opportunities for underserved communities such as rural farmers and the Orang Asli community. This, according to Lazada, is proof that local heritage products have a growing market in Malaysia.</p>
      <blockquote>“As we observe a significant shift in the demand for a more entertaining, rewarding and cashless shopping experience, we are confident that Lazada will continue to meet these needs while being a key contributor towards the rapid and sustainable growth of the Malaysian digital economy. We are proud to be at the forefront of eCommerce   in   Malaysia,   setting   industry   standards   and   becoming a trusted platform for both consumers and merchants.”</blockquote>
