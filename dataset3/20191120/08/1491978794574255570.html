        <i>In a country where poor people are doing DIY dentistry, the idea has a human as well as financial value</i>
      </p>
      <p>When Labour releases its manifesto on Thursday, all eyes will be on the policies, from high-speed broadband, <a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/labour-announces-plans-scrap-prescription-charges/">scrapping prescription charges</a> and ending tuition fees to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50448108">free dental check-ups</a>. What’s really interesting, though, isn’t the policies themselves but the principle that binds them: universal services.</p>
      <p>Be it healthcare or access to the internet, the message that comes with these measures is one of collective politics – the notion that the state has a duty to provide top-rate services for all, and that a society is better when it pools resources to ensure no one misses out.</p>
      <p>Predictably, it has come under fire from critics. “Why not throw in free Sky TV? Free iPhones? Netflix and Xboxes all round?” <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislesliemp/status/1195106186577793027?s=21">asked the former Labour MP</a> Chris Leslie. Or, as the Times journalist Iain Martin <a href="https://twitter.com/iainmartin1/status/1195276817311182848?s=2%201">put it in his aghast response</a> to Labour’s broadband announcement last week: “Everything is horribly, brutally possible.”</p>
      <p>The arguments against universal services are noticeably weak. Take the notion that wealthy Conservatives would <a href="https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/11/corbyn-and-mcdonnell-want-you-to-attack-their-broadband-pledge/">prefer to pay for their own services</a> out of concern for the poorest. Even progressives have questioned a strategy that, on the face of it, gives perks to the rich (I’ve been torn on whether free tuition would be better spent on equalising early-years education, for example), but this dilemma means little without a desire to invest money elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I don’t recall many of the commentators outraged over high earners getting free antibiotics expressing concern when disabled people were having to choose between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/video/2017/may%20/30/living-with-disabilities-youre-treated-worse-than-a-farm-animal-video">buying medicine and food</a>. Indeed, those claiming the funds needed for universal services <a href="https://twitter.com/chrislesliemp/status/1195106815471734784?s=21">could be better spent</a> on the poorest are typically the same people who eagerly supported austerity measures that have left many to live on a pittance.</p>
      <p>Others point to how much blanket provision would cost. While it’s true there’s a considerable price tag to universal services, it saves money in a number of ways. Providing universal effective broadband will increase productivity, for example; free dental check-ups will save on hospital bills from the many people who <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/labour-bring-back-free-dental-20896187">can’t afford to visit dentists</a> – the 515,000 patients who go to GPs or A&amp;E with toothache cost the NHS more than £38m every year alone.</p>
      <p>Besides, means-testing is notoriously ineffective and costly – why not spend all those resources on alleviating the problems themselves rather than gatekeeping who “deserves” help?</p>
      <p>Underneath resistance to universal services sit certain assumptions that have long plagued British politics – ones that equate shrinking the state with common sense. The same social and economic orthodoxy that favours making large cuts during a recession <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/uk-economy-100bn-smaller-because-of-austerity-thinktank">contrary to evidence</a> consistently presents means-testing – and privatising key services – as efficient. It suggests that “grownups” understand how politics is about accepting the unequal circumstances we find ourselves in and making minor tweaks where we can. A society where people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/03/rise-of-diy-dentistry-britons-doing-own-fillings-to-avoid-nhs-bill">have been forced to do DIY dentistry</a> because they can;t afford to go to a registered dentist is, apparently, seen as the rational option.</p>
      <p>In reality, universal programmes tend to be better precisely because they are used by the whole of society. When only marginalised people rely on a service, politicians can easily keep the quality low, whereas if the middle class has a stake in a service, standards are typically expected to be higher – and there is more fuss if they fall. Compare attitudes to the NHS with those to out-of-work disability benefits. Both are, in theory, similar: they provide support for people in times of bad health but receive very different treatment by the public, and subsequently politicians. While the NHS is typically seen as a “good service” that should be protected, out-of-work disability benefits – which are relied on by the poorest and disabled – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35749078">can be cut</a> or <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-49891159">run terribly</a> with widespread acceptance.</p>
      <p>As the UK faces a general election after a decade of deep cuts to services, there couldn’t be a better time to question these ideas – to ask what life in one of the wealthiest nations on Earth should really be like. Whether financial or human, there is great value in investing in world-class health, education and technology that we build and use together. A politics that is defined by such universality is the real commonsense solution. It’s the secret that critics want to keep hidden: everything is hopefully, beautifully possible.</p>
