      <h2>Micah Richards says Liverpool FC captain Jordan Henderson is world class</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:30:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">The Sport Review staff</a></address>
      <h3>Michah Richards has hailed Jordan Henderson as “world class”, comparing the Liverpool FC captain to Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane.</h3>
      <p>The 29-year-old has been a key part of the Reds team so far this season, helping Liverpool FC to challenge for the title.</p>
      <p>Henderson scored in Liverpool FC’s 2-1 win against Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield last month.</p>
      <p>He was a key part of their 3-1 victory over Manchester City last time out, making an assist for Sadio Mane.</p>
      <p>The Reds are sitting eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC in the Premier League title race.</p>
      <p>Henderson played his part in England’s successful Uefa 2020 qualifying campaign, easing to victories over Kosovo and Montenegro.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester City defender Richards described Henderson as “world class” after his performances for club and country this term.</p>
      <p>“Harry Kane is world class,” Richards said on <i>BBC Radio 5 Live</i>.</p>
      <p>“In midfield, there’s no other world, world class midfielders. Henderson, you’d argue Henderson’s world class, because of what he’s done and consistency and whatnot.</p>
      <p>“He’s won a European Cup, he’s been consistent over the last three or four years. Yeah, it really is [hard to write off a Champions League-winning captain].</p>
      <p>“You know what, I’m going to go with that statement, I’m going to say Henderson is world class and a lot of the work that he does goes unnoticed because he’s not getting 10 assists a season or scoring 10 goals a season.</p>
      <p>“I was referring to on the field but off the field as well. I’ve played with Henderson and he’s just an honest guy who would run through brick walls for you, he’s willing to improve, he wants the team to be at its best.</p>
      <p>“When Liverpool first signed him a lot of people were raising their eyebrows but now I think we have to start giving him the credit that he’s due.</p>
      <p>“I watched him in the Liverpool-Man City game and he just doesn’t stop running.”</p>
      <p>Henderson moved to Liverpool FC in a £20m deal from Sunderland in the 2011 summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has netted one goal and has made one appearance in 12 games in the Premier League this term.</p>
      <p>Henderson has appeared in two Champions League games in the current campaign.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are currently eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>The Reds will make the trip to Crystal Palace in their next league fixture on Saturday.</p>
