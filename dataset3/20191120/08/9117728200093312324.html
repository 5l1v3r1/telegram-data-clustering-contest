        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/sebastian-vettel">Sebastian Vettel</a> has heaped the praise on <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a> driver <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> for how he's responded to being dropped from <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> midway through the 2019 Formula 1 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gasly started the campaign at Red Bull after being promoted from Toro Rosso to replace the departing <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a>. However, the French driver was completely outperformed by his team-mate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> came in to replace Gasly at Red Bull, with the 23-year-old moving back to Toro Rosso, but the Frenchman has been driving "brilliantly" since being back at his former team.</p>

      <p>Gasly recorded his first-ever podium finish on Sunday, shocking the F1 world by reaching the chequered flag in second-place, behind former team-mate Verstappen, in a hugely dramatic race in Brazil.</p>
      <p>Vettel, who had to retire from the race due to being involved in a <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/news/50505/sebastian-vettel-insists-he-is-not-to-blame-i-was-going-straight-.html">collision with his team-mate Charles Leclerc</a>, has heaped the praise on Gasly for his drive on Sunday and his form since returning to Toro Rosso.</p>
      <p><i>"I'm happy for him," </i>Vettel said on Gasly to <i>RaceFans. "Obviously I don't know the results, but I'm happy for him. I think he deserves it. I think he drove brilliantly since he got downgraded. I don't know what's the plan in the future with him."</i></p>
