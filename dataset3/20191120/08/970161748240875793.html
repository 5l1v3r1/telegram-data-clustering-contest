      <p>Lady Victoria Hervey admitted she believes that ‘sex trafficking’ was not the right term to describe convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes during an interview on Good Morning Britain.</p>
      <p>The model and socialite joined the breakfast show to talk about her friendship with Ghislaine Maxwell and how she ended up staying at Epstein’s New York City apartment, as well as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-defends-car-crash-interview-saying-spoke-honesty-humility-11173141/">‘s recent BBC ‘car crash’ interview</a>.</p>
      <p>Piers asked: ‘When you discovered, just before he died, and all these women had come forward all telling a story of underage abuse and targetting and trafficking and so on, what did you feel about what had emerged?’</p>

      <p>‘I was completely shocked,’ Lady Victoria replied. ‘I was so shocked because I just had no idea. I really had no idea. The more I was reading about it, the more I was actually like, wow, I was actually in one of these apartments and I saw all of it but I didn’t see it.’</p>
      <p>‘I was there and I was at the dinners and I saw things but I didn’t see the truth. I had no idea what was really going on.’</p>
      <p>She then went on to add: ‘I think, to be honest, the word sex trafficking that’s a very strong word and I don’t think that’s the correct word to use for this.</p>
      <p>‘When you think of sex trafficking, you think of a 12-year-old that’s kidnapped that’s chained in a cage. This is not the same thing. These girls were living the high life.’</p>

      <p>‘You might think that,’ interrupted Susanna.</p>
      <p>Piers then stepped in to remind Lady Victoria of the gravity of Epstein’s crimes, for which he was awaiting trial for sex trafficking before he reportedly hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10.</p>

      <p>‘Let’s be honest, Epstein was convicted of procuring a 14-year-old girl for sex that is trafficking,’ he clapped back. ‘When they’re underage it is trafficking.</p>
      <p>‘They are being trafficked these girls. It’s literally been described as a railway station. In and out all the time. Many of them underage.</p>
