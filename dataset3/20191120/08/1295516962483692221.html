      <h1>Disney+ Reportedly Working on 'Continue Watching' Feature</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:11:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Russell</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney-plus/">Disney+</a> launched on Nov. 12 to an eagerly awaiting audience ready to binge-watch what the new streaming platform had to offer. However, while the content -- including a mixture of classic cartoons and shows as well as new offerings such as <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a></i> -- certainly impressed, the service itself lacked some key features that have come to be expected thanks to more established platforms <a href="https://screenrant.com/disney-plus-shows-netflix-difference-no-opening-titles/">such as Netflix</a> and Amazon Hulu, including a "Continue Watching" option.</p>
      <p>The missing feature acts as a handy tool that allows viewers to pick up where they left off, whether it’s rolling onto the next episode or resuming a show or movie because you had an errand to run. Thankfully, though, it appears <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a> already has plans in place to remedy this oversight.</p>

      <p>There's currently no timetable as to when Disney+ subscribers can expect this addition to be included in an update, but the service is reportedly hoping to launch it relatively soon. This turnaround of feature inclusion appears to suggest that Disney is keenly listening to user feedback and features requests, leading to a smoother experience for its subscriber base.</p>
      <p>Disney+ is now available in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, with content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, <i>Star Wars</i> and National Geographic.</p>
