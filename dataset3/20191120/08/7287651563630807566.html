      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14723"/>NZXT is so excited about their new CAM 4.0 software, that they even out a press release. NZXT CAM 4.0 has been built from the ground up to improve the overall experience. The redesigned user interface has been simplified and better organized to prioritize the most critical info users need to understand the health of their PC.</p>
      <p>Through the new enhanced experience, users have greater control of the data that they share and receive within NZXT CAM. New categories, such as bandwidth and resource per-process usage let users understand what processes are the most stressful to their systems. Finally, NZXT CAM’s gameplay overlay has been upgraded to enhance control of what info they find important to display in-game while being less intrusive.  </p>
      <p>NZXT CAM 4.0 is optimized so that it will launch and install quicker, be less resource-intensive on a system, and be more stable to provide users with the best experience. A simplified user interface allows users to quickly find the data that they want to see and prioritizes the information that they need to know.</p>
