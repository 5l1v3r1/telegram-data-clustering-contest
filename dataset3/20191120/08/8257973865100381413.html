      <p>Nov. 20 (UPI) -- The Israeli military said Wednesday it carried out "wide-scale" strikes against Iranian targets in Syria overnight in retaliation for rockets fired at the country a day earlier.</p>
      <p>Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee said in <a href="https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1196954067685261318">a statement</a> that warplanes had struck dozens of Iran's elite Al Quds Forces and Syrian military targets in Syria, including surface-to-air missiles, munition depots and military bases in areas concentred near Damascus.</p>

      <p>Israel said the 1 a.m. attack was in retaliation for four rockets launched at Israel from Syria early Tuesday, all of which <a href="https://twitter.com/IDF/status/1196632886692253698">were intercepted</a> by Israel's <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Iron_Dome/?tps=1">Iron Dome</a> missile defense system.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who shoots at the state of Israel during the day will not sleep at night," said Israeli Defense Minister <a href="https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Syrian-air-defenses-intercept-missiles-over-Damascus-reports-608381">Naftali Bennett</a>. "Our message to Iran's leaders is simple: You are no longer immune. Wherever you stretch your tentacles, we will hack them off."</p>
      <p>The IDF said it also destroyed several Syrian air defense batteries as surface-to-air missiles were fired from Syria at the attacking forces despite receiving warnings to stand down.</p>
      <p>"I have made it clear that whoever hurts us -- we will hurt him," Prime Minister <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Benjamin_Netanyahu/?tps=1">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> said in <a href="https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/spoke_attack201119">a statement</a>. "This is what we did overnight vis-a-vis military targets of the Iranian Al Quds force and Syrian military targets in Syria after a barrage of rockets was launched at Israel."</p>
      <p>Syria's <a href="https://sana.sy/en/?p=178782">SANA news agency</a> reported that two civilians were killed and two others were injured in the attack while claiming the Syrian military intercepted most of the Israeli-launched missiles.</p>
      <p>Israel has blamed Tuesday's rocket launch from Syria on Iran, and the IDF said it is prepared for retaliation.</p>
      <p>"Yesterday's Iranian attack on Israeli territory by firing intercepted missiles is the best proof of Iran's real reason in Syria," Adraee said. "Iranian positions pose a threat to Israel's security, stability in the region and the Syrian regime."</p>
      <p>The attack comes a week after Israel conducted <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/12/Islamic-Jihad-fires-50-rockets-into-Israel-after-senior-leader-killed/7241573543162/?upi_ss=Israel">a predawn strike</a> on the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, killing one of its commanders, Baha Abu al-Ata.</p>
