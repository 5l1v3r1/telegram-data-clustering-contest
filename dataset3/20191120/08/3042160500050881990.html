      <h1>Black Nursing Home Executive Wins $6M Settlement Thanks to Her Former Boss Complaining She Couldn’t Stomach ‘Black Person Walking Around Here in a Suit’</h1>

      <p>A Black former nursing home executive won more than $6 million in a New Jersey discrimination suit after her boss allegedly halted her promotion because of her race.</p>
      <p>“I am very happy that justice was served,” Rebecca McCarthy told Atlanta Black Star in an email Wednesday.</p>

      <p>The woman earlier said in a civil complaint that Care One executive Alison Fitzpatrick-Durski told her, “I don’t want a black person walking around here in a suit as VP. I want you in scrubs, flats and a lab coat.”</p>
      <p>McCarthy said she was fired the next day at the Bound Brook facility and replaced by a white woman. </p>
      <p>“A black person just like any other hardworking qualified person deserves to hold a VP title and wear a suit without discrimination,” McCarthy said. “Ms. Fitzpatrick-Durski made it clear to me on her first day on the job that she didn’t want to see a black person in the VP position.”</p>
      <p>McCarthy was originally offered a promotion to vice president when she informed the company she was accepting another position in 2016, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>She instead stayed and worked as vice president a few months until a recently hired senior vice president asked her to return to her former position, McCarthy stated in the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>“It is a shame that CareOne continues to defend such disgusting behavior,” McCarthy told Atlanta Black Star. “I hope that this never happens to anyone else.”</p>
      <p>Fitzpatrick-Durski denied referencing race when she spoke to McCarthy and claimed she was trying to get the woman to prioritize hands-on patient care, the Daily Mail reported.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for the company said McCarthy was fired due to her performance, and they backed up Fitzpatrick-Durski’s claim that she wasn’t racist as evidenced by her direct reports being minorities, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>Attorneys also highlighted Fitzpatrick-Durski’s former marriage to a Black man and said she ‘is the mother of three children who partake of African American heritage,’ the Daily Mail reported.  </p>
      <p>A judge is scheduled to rule on the defense’s motion to dismiss the verdict on Nov. 22, the newspaper reported. </p>
      <p>McCarthy’s lawyers contend race was the only reason their client was fired and that Fitzpatrick-Durski allegedly referred to another black employee as a slave. </p>
      <p>A jury siding with McCarthy awarded the woman $4.1 million in punitive damages and about $1.8 million in compensatory damages, the New Jersey Law Journal reported.</p>
      <p>McCarthy’s case isn’t the first legal matter Care One has faced regarding how its employees are treated.</p>
      <p>Amid a federal appeals court ruling in 2016 that the business violated fair labor practices at its Morristown facility when workers were trying to unionize, Care One organized a mandatory meeting to prove it was “a family,” Nj.com reported.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, the business played a slideshow of images from a Valentine’s Day party and played Sister Sledge’s “We Are Family” in the background.</p>
      <p>Care One has not yet responded to an Atlanta Black Star request for comment.</p>
