      <h2>Everton striker Moise Kean has struggled since his big-money move in the summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:15:50+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>AS Roma have a plan to sign Everton striker Moise Kean, according to reports. With the Italian struggling at Goodison Park since<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/04/everton-sign-moise-kean-juventus"> his reported (The Guardian) £29 million </a>summer move, plenty of clubs in Italy have been linked with a move to bring Kean back to Serie A. </p>
      <p>AC Milan and Sampdoria have been mentioned before but now Roma appears to be a potential option as well. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/16-63433453/kean_alla_roma_petrachi_allassalto_ecco_il_piano/">As reported by Corriere dello Sport,</a> Roma are readying a loan deal until the end of the season, at which point they would buy Kean for a fee in the region of €23 million (£19.7m). </p>

      <p>The report suggests Everton have a ‘willingness to negotiate’ as they are ‘very disappointed’ with Kean and want to minimise the potential financial damage of him continuing to struggle on Merseyside and leaving down the line.</p>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>Most Everton fans want to see Kean come good and would therefore not want to see him exit the club in January. </p>
      <p>However, it is easy to understand why this might tempt the club. If Kean continues to struggle at Goodison Park for the rest of the season then getting upwards of £20 million might be a tough task. </p>
      <p>If they move him on now, Everton would swallow a small financial blow but could quickly find a replacement to try and placate the fanbase. </p>
      <p>It will certainly be interesting to see which way Everton go.</p>
