      <h2>Liverpool FC legend Xabi Alonso is a big fan of Brazilian midfielder Fabinho</h2>

      <h3>Xabi Alonso says Liverpool FC midfielder Fabinho’s greatest asset is his anticipation.</h3>
      <p>The Brazil international was named man of the match in Liverpool FC’s 3-1 victory over defending champions Manchester City at Anfield earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Fabinho broke the deadlock in the first half with a brilliant long-range strike before he shielded the Liverpool FC defence expertly to help the home side claim three points.</p>
      <p>The South American star has established himself as a key player in the Liverpool FC team over the past 12 months after he initially was used sparingly following his move to Anfield.</p>
      <p>The Reds signed Fabinho in a £40m deal from Ligue 1 side AS Monaco after the 25-year-old was previously linked with a move to Liverpool FC’s rivals Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC midfielder Alondo picked out aspects of Fabinho’s game that he really admires.</p>
      <p>“He is connected to the game, always. His anticipation is his greatest asset,” Alonso told <i>The Athletic</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/xabi-alonso-reveals-what-makes-liverpool-ace-fabinho-so-special-11177905/">Metro</a>.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes you only have to take one or two steps to change the movements of your team-mates and that can determine the whole outcome of the game without anyone really realising because spectators tend to follow the ball rather than the player.</p>
      <p>“He’s not reacting one second later, he’s anticipating what is going to happen one second before.”</p>
      <p>Fabinho has scored two goals in 58 games in all competitions since his move to Liverpool FC over 18 months ago.</p>
      <p>The Brazil midfielder was part of the Reds team that won the Champions League title last season thanks to a 2-0 win against Tottenham Hotspur in the final.</p>
      <p>Fabinho has previously played for Real Madrid and AS Monaco before his big-money switch to the Anfield outfit.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will take on Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Saturday.</p>
