      <h2>The Twice Brewed Inn to take advantage of its Dark Sky Park location in Northumberland, by playing host to stargazing evenings</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:24:21+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author">Darren Kelso</a></address>
      <p>A packed programme of stargazing evenings has been added to the menu at one of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland’s</a> most popular pubs.</p>
      <p>The Twice Brewed Inn, on one of the most dramatic stretches of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/hadrians-wall">Hadrian’s Wall</a> , is making the very most of its Dark Sky Park location by teaming up with astronomers from Go Stargazing to launch a series of events throughout this autumn and winter.</p>
      <p>Led by co-founders Wil Cheung and Neill Sanders, the Go Stargazing team will take visitors and guests on an exciting and inspiring exploration of the starry night skies, including an amazing view of the Milky Way and the chance to see thousands more stars than would normally be available to see from one of the region’s towns or cities.</p>
      <p>And all 34 night-time events on the programme, which begins on November 27, have been scheduled to coincide with nights when there will be no bright moon to spoil the view.</p>

      <p>The Twice Brewed Inn, recently shortlisted in the Pub of the Year category for the North East Tourism Awards 2020, offers a perfect location from which to experience the incredible skies above Northumberland.</p>
      <p>Not only does it benefit from minimal light pollution thanks to the area’s protected dark sky status, it’s also a warm and welcoming pub – plus it couldn’t be easier to make a night of it with restaurant quality food and 19 comfy en-suite bedrooms.</p>
      <p>The Twice Brewed Inn’s newly appointed events manager, Laura Daniels, said: “We are absolutely delighted to be launching this exciting new stargazing programme at The Twice Brewed Inn.</p>
      <p>“Our location in Northumberland Dark Sky Park offers amazing opportunities to explore the incredible starry skies and Wil and his team absolutely blew us away with their knowledge and enthusiasm. We can’t wait to welcome our first Twice Brewed stargazers and hope they make the most of their time here.”</p>
      <p>The stargazing events will begin with an inspiring presentation on an astronomically themed topic – ideally suited for beginners and novices – in the Twice Brewed Brew House’s Tap Room.</p>
      <p>Everyone will then be moved outdoors for a laser guided tour of the constellations and a chance to observe incredibly distant objects including planets, galaxies, nebulae and star clusters using large aperture telescopes.</p>
      <p>Guests are also encouraged to bring along their own telescopes if they’d like some expert help from the Go Stargazing astronomers, many of who are former volunteers from the Kielder Observatory.</p>
      <p>And if the weather isn’t being kind? The team will always be prepared with a series of fun, interactive sessions ready for indoor learning – all the while being ready to get straight outside whenever there’s a gap in the clouds.</p>

      <p>“Everyone at Go Stargazing is thrilled to be partnering up with The Twice Brewed Inn for what we’re sure will be a very special programme of stargazing events,” said Wil Cheung.</p>
      <p>“The location of The Twice Brewed makes it an absolutely amazing place from which to see all that the sky has to offer. Meanwhile being able to enjoy some great food, a pint or two and have a nice comfortable bed to go back to when the stargazing is finished, makes it even more appealing!</p>
      <p>“We’re really looking forward to introducing as many people as possible to stargazing at Twice Brewed – we’ve already done some staff sessions and they absolutely loved them.”</p>
