      <h1>Besiktas keen on struggling West Ham newbie Albian Ajeti</h1>
      <h2>West Ham signed the Swiss striker in the summer but he has struggled for form.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:45:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>West Ham United striker Albian Ajeti is wanted by Turkish club Besiktas according to reports. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.aksam.com.tr/spor/besiktasta-forvete-ucuncu-aday-albian-ajeti/haber-1022770">Aksam in Turkey,</a> among many other sources, is reporting that the Swiss striker is on the club’s shortlist of transfer options for the winter, along with Viktoria Plzen striker Michael Krmencik and Aston Villa’s Jonathan Kodjia. </p>
      <p>Besiktas have had a difficult start to the season by their high standards and currently sit eighth in the Turkish Super Lig. They are also bottom of their Europa League group, having lost all four of their games so far.  The club are looking for a new striker to help them turn around their fortunes.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.star.com.tr/spor/ajetiyi-avlayacak-haber-1494919/">Star is now suggesting</a> that Besiktas coach Abdullah Avci has earmarked Ajeti as the main target and is hoping the Istanbul club can convince West Ham into a sale in January. </p>
      <p>
        <b>TBR’s View</b>
      </p>
      <p>It would be a shock to see West Ham give up on Ajeti in January, considering they only signed him in the summer. </p>
      <p>Signed from FC Basel in a deal <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/08/07/west-ham-hopeful-signing-basel-forward-albian-ajeti-8m/">reported (The Telegraph) to be worth around £8 million, </a>he was a necessary arrival. West Ham lost Marko Arnautovic, Andy Carroll, Lucas Perez, and Jordan Hugill from their attack in the summer. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>“I worked with (director of football) Mario Husillos to find a new striker, we had a lot of different names and finally we set for Haller. We have Albian Ajeti too, I trust him a lot.”</b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Ajeti already had two goals from three appearances with Basel this season and scored 21 times for the Swiss club last season. </p>
      <p>But, despite Manuel Pellegrini <a href="https://www.football.london/west-ham-united-fc/fixtures-results/every-word-manuel-pellegrini-just-16812205">insisting to Football.London that he ‘trusts</a>’ Ajeti in attack, the 22-year-old has played just four times in the Premier League this season.</p>
