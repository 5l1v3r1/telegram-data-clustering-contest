      <p>At least two houses and multiple sheds have been destroyed by the out-of-control Yorketown bushfire. Another uncontrolled fire is burning near Price, also on the Yorke Peninsula, on a day of record-breaking heat and high winds.</p>
      <p>CFS crews are attempting to direct the Yorketown fire towards the beach to minimise its spread, but it is still too early to assess the full impact.</p>
      <p>The fire started on the outskirts of Yorketown, just 100m from houses, and has destroyed hundreds of hectares of crops and paddocks as it burns in a south-easterly direction towards St Vincent Highway, and towards the coastline in the vicinity of Edithburgh, Wattle Point and Troubridge Point.</p>
      <p>The Price fire was contained earlier on Wednesday afternoon, but broke containment lines in the evening.</p>
      <p>Conditions are dangerous and firefighters warned they were unable to prevent the fires from spreading.</p>
      <p>If you are in the area of one of these fires, take shelter in a solid building. It is too late to leave by foot or vehicle - the roads will not be safe.</p>
      <p>Three other fires - one near Jamestown, another near Angaston in the Barossa Valley, and a third at Beaufort near Port Wakefield - have now been downgraded.</p>
      <p>For the latest fire information from across the state, <a href="https://www.cfs.sa.gov.au/site/warnings_and_incidents.jsp">please visit the CFS website</a> and look at the latest blog posts at the bottom of this story.</p>
      <p>On a day of extreme and in some areas record-breaking November heat, Ceduna was the first place in SA to reach 40C at 10.19am, and reached 46.2C at 3pm. Many other areas around the state exceeded 44C. Adelaide's temperature hit a maximum of 41.6C at West Tce at 4.21pm.</p>
      <p>More than 100 government schools <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/2b6f2fd0a0f2d46d44124ac07183896b">were closed today </a>due to the extreme weather conditions.</p>
