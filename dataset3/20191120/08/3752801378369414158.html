      <p>"ER24 paramedics arrived on the scene at 12:25 to find another service already administering CPR on the older man.</p>
      <p>"It is alleged that he came into contact with a live pole next to the fence," said Campbell.</p>
      <p>"The second man, believed to be in his 20s, attempted to assist him but was then also electrocuted. The older man's condition unfortunately deteriorated and he was declared dead on the scene.</p>
