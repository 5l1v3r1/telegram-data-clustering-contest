      <p>Back in July, Facebook <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/facebook-will-soon-start-publishing-new-apps-under-different-brand-name/">announced</a> that it will start releasing new consumer-focused apps under different brand name. Instead of Facebook, these new apps will be published under the developer name “NPE Team, from Facebook.” In order to lower the expectations from these apps, Facebook is not using its brand name. NPE team has now published a new app called Whale in App Store. Whale is a meme creator app that will allow you to create memes using your own images or the stock photo library it offers. With this Facebook meme creator app, you can get creative with text, images, emojis, filters, and popular effects. Once created, the meme can be shared on social media or directly in your conversations right from the app.</p>

      <p><b>Note</b>: NPE (stands for New Product Experimentation) Team apps will be experimental in nature, they will change very rapidly and may get shut down if the team learn that they’re not useful to people.</p>
