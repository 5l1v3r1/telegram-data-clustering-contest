      <p>Beauty chain Boots sent shoppers into meltdown last month after shaking up its famous three for two promotion in the run up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>In an unexpected twist, the retailer scrapped the tradition - in exchange for a new 25% off deal which it promised would offer equal savings.</p>
      <p>However, after widespread backlash over the chain's decision to axe the popular deal, Boots returned, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/boots-missing-3for2-sale-20750494">reassuring shoppers that it would be back - and the day has finally arrived</a>.</p>
      <p>The annual sale, which includes gift sets from brands such as Ted Baker, Yankee Candle, Soap and Glory and more, allows you to pick up the cheapest item for free in stores and online throughout the festive season.</p>
      <p>And it's <a href="https://www.boots.com/christmas/christmas-3-for-2?">now returned</a> - with shoppers also able to get an extra 10% off when they spend £50 or more online.</p>

      <p>"We aim to improve our savings throughout the festive period every year.</p>
      <p>"Our customers tell us how much they value 3 for 2 when they have lots of gifts to buy, however, we know not all of our customers want or need to buy 3 gifts, so, this year we’re introducing new and different ways to help all our customers get great value at Boots, whatever their budget.</p>
      <p>"Customers can expect to see either 3 for 2 or save 25% discount offers go live on amazing giftsets in the run up to Christmas, and don’t forget our unmissable Big Deals which are available until stocks last.</p>
