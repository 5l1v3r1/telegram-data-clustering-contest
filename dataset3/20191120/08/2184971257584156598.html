      <p>“For all of my shortcomings, and all of my mistakes, I apologise profusely and unqualifiedly,” he added.</p>
      <p>Since the incident took place the Oxford Union's Secretary, the Chief of Staff, the Director of Press and the Director of Operations, have all left their roles, according to The Cherwell.</p>
      <p>Mr Azamati, an international relations scholar from Ghana, said his treatment left him feeling “unwelcome in the Union, Oxford and even the country”.</p>
      <p>He successfully appealed on Saturday against what he told the BBC were claims of “false violent disorder” by the union.</p>
