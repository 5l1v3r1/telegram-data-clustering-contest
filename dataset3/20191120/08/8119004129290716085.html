        <b>A drug suspect has died in a so-called shootout with Rapid Action Battalion, or RAB, in Dhaka’s Hazaribagh.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident occurred at a RAB checkpost in front of Sikder Medical College in Hazaribagh in the early hours of Wednesday, said RAB-2 Company Commander Sheikh Nazmul Arefin.</p>
      <p>The dead man has been identified as 38-year-old Nadim Bahadur from an ID card. He was a resident of the capital’s Hazaribagh area. Nadim was implicated in nine drug-related cases, RAB said.</p>
      <p>RAB was conducting searches at a checkpost near Sikder Medical when a motorcycle approached it at 4:15am, said Sheikh Nazmul.</p>
      <p>“RAB officers signalled the vehicle to stop but the riders opened fire instead. As a result, the elite force was compelled to retaliate. A man was shot in the gunfight while another fled the scene with the motorcycle.”</p>
      <p>The injured man was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where the on-duty doctor declared him dead, said Nazmul.</p>
      <p>A pistol, four rounds of bullets, and ‘several’ drugs have been recovered from the spot, he said.</p>
