      <p>Rag ‘n’ Bone Man and his wife, Beth Rouy have split up after six months of marriage, according to new reports.</p>
      <p>The couple, who tied the knot in May, have reportedly gone their separate ways but are ‘staying amicable’ for the sake of their son.</p>
      <p>Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, whose real name is Rory Graham, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/03/rag-n-bone-man-marries-long-term-girlfriend-beth-rouy-whole-wedding-party-wore-trackies-9395398/">married his long-time girlfriend in Lewes Registry Office, and the bride, groom and wedding party all wore tracksuits to mark the occasion.</a></p>
      <p>A source told The Sun: ‘It’s a great shame, but these things happen. Everyone is staying amicable, and they have a son together who is their top priority.</p>
      <p>‘He likes to keep a low profile so doesn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but there are no explosive rows and he isn’t likely to say anything about it.’</p>

      <p>The singer quit social media in October, telling fans he was ‘taking time off’ from Twitter and Instagram.</p>
      <p>Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, 34, and Beth, 26, live together in a three-acre gated estate near Brighton with their two-year-old son Reuben, and had been together for 10 years.</p>

      <p>The source added: ‘It looks like it’s a very sad end to what was a very loving and long-term relationship.</p>
      <p>‘The wedding pictures show what a quirky couple they were, which makes how this has ended so soon even more heartbreaking.</p>
      <p>‘Only they know what really happened and the truth of anything that was said.’</p>

      <p>The Human star had spoken out about how much he was loving married life in June, telling reporters: ‘It’s great, man.</p>
      <p>‘We’ve been together for ten years anyway so it’s exactly the same. We’ve just got the same name now.’</p>
      <p>Rag ‘n’ Bone Man has largely tried to keep his private life out of the spotlight, so it’s unlikely he will be speaking out publicly about the reported break up.</p>
