      <h1>Jason Watt: Nico Hulkenberg to blame for his own Formula 1 exit</h1>

        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/nico-hulkenberg">Nico Hulkenberg</a> will be leaving <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/renault-f1-team">Renault</a> after the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/abu-dhabi-grand-prix">Abu Dhabi Grand Prix</a> next weekend, and the German driver will not be racing in Formula 1 next season, and this is down to his own performances, according to former F3000 winner Jason Watt.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was announced earlier in the season that Esteban Ocon would be making a return to F1 after a year out and that the Frenchman would be replacing Hulkenberg at the French manufacturer.</p>
      <p>Hulkenberg was then linked with a move to <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/haas-f1">Haas</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/alfa-romeo-racing">Alfa Romeo</a>, but both teams decided to stick with what they already have for a further season, leaving the former Force India driver without a seat for 2020.</p>

      <p>Watt reminisced on the Force India part of Hulkenberg's career, where the German driver grew a "pretty good reputation" by dominating his team-mates at the British team.</p>
      <p><i>"After that, the curve stagnated severely," </i>Watt said to <i>Ekstra Bladet. "For the past five seasons, including 2019, he has finished ahead of his team-mate in the championship only once.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"He looked good in 2018 with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a>, though, so I was excited to see him against <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniel-ricciardo">Daniel Ricciardo</a> this year."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Watt would've liked to have seen fellow Dane <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kevin-magnussen">Kevin Magnussen</a> with Hulkenberg beside him at Haas next season: <i>"It doesn't do much for Kevin when <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/romain-grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a> has those periods of stupid mistakes. So for Kevin's sake, I would have liked to see Hulkenberg there in 2020.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Now it seems that he will end his days in DTM or Formula E, and in my book, he has himself to blame for that."</i>
