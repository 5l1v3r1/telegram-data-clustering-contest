      <p>BANGKOK, Nov 20 —Thailand’s Constitutional Court today disqualified the leader of an opposition party and fierce government critic from parliament after finding him guilty of violating election law.</p>
      <p>Thanathorn Jungroongruangkit, 40, the leader of the Future Forward Party, was found guilty of holding shares in a media company after registering his candidacy for an election earlier this year to formally end five years of military rule.</p>
      <p>Thanathorn is a strong opponent of the army’s role in politics and his new party came in a surprise third in the March election.</p>
      <p>Future Forward is part of an opposition alliance that disputed the vote count and accused the army of writing the electoral rules to ensure that Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former military junta leader, would remain in power. — Reuters</p>
