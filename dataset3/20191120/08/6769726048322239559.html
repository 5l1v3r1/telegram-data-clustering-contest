      <p>PARTICIPANTS are gearing up for the annual MSWA Ocean Ride, which will roll in to Hillarys on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Now in its 10th year, the event includes a 10km family ride starting at Scarborough Beach Reserve and 30km, 50km, 70km, 100km and 120km rides starting at Esplanade Reserve in Fremantle, all finishing at Whitfords Nodes Park.</p>
      <p>This year’s ambassador, Haylee Clarke, is riding for her husband Troy, who has Huntington’s disease.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud to ride in honour of Troy this year and raise awareness of the condition, which has had such an impact on our lives,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a safe and well organised event and seeing so many people participating on the day gives me a great comfort that it’s not just me fighting for Troy.”</p>
      <p>Troy’s birthday is the day before the ride and he will be at the finish line to celebrate with birthday cake and entertainment from a live band.</p>
      <p>MSWA provides vital support and services to people living with all neurological conditions in WA.</p>
      <p>This includes people living with multiple sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, motor neurone disease, and acquired brain injury.</p>
