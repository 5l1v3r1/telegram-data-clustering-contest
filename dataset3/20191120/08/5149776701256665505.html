      <h1>Improved relationship with Nottingham Forest delights new Notts County owners</h1>
      <h2>Forest and Notts have rebuilt their relationship after difficulties under the Magpies' previous ownership</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:54:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Nottingham Forest’s relationship with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts County</a> is one which continues to flourish, according to the Magpies new owners.</p>
      <p>The two city neighbours have rebuilt their relationship following County’s takeover in the summer, and even struck a deal for the Magpies to use their <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/notts-county-complete-move-nottingham-3378382">Trent Pool training facility</a> which the National League outfit hope will be extended beyond the end of the current season.</p>
      <p>“We are really happy with our relationship,” said Christoffer Reedtz.</p>
      <p>“Nicholas Randall has been really welcoming.</p>
      <p>“We are really pleased with the relationship we are building.”</p>

      <p>Notts under their previous ownership benefited from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> sanctioning the release of loan players, with the likes of Jorge Grant, Ryan Yates and Virgil Gomis all moving across the Trent.</p>
      <p>Reedtz hasn’t ruled out there being other benefits to the relationship in the future, with the clubs continuing to work closely.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great thing for us that we can use <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/notts-county-secure-new-training-3005422">the training ground at the moment</a>. We hope there are other things we can work on together in the future,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have secured Forest’s facilities until the end of the season. That’s worked really well.</p>
      <p>“We are wondering whether we can extend that lease.</p>

      <p>“We think it’s very important to have a great training facility to prepare for matches.”</p>
      <p>Boss Neal Ardley, meanwhile, hailed Forest’s training facility on the banks of the Trent as fantastic.</p>
      <p>“The facilities are fantastic. Championships are won Monday to Friday. The 3pm is the end product,” he told <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/notts-owner-discuss-plans-forum-3554492">a Magpies fan forum held at Meadow Lane on Tuesday night</a>.</p>
