      <h2>Jamie Carragher has been speaking about Jose Mourinho and Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:21:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Carragher has explained why Jose Mourinho is the right man to take over from <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and lead Tottenham forward.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked on Tuesday evening after five years in charge of the club.</p>
      <p>The Argentine oversaw four successive top-four finishes in the Premier League, something which culminated in a trip to the Champions League final in June.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> lost the final against Liverpool and the poor Premier League form that led up to the contest in Madrid continued into this season, with the club sat in 14th ahead of the clash against West Ham United at the weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> quickly became the favourite to replace Pochettino and less than twelve hours after the latter's exit, the former Manchester United and Chelsea boss was confirmed as the new head coach of Spurs.</p>
      <p>Carragher, for one, believes that Mourinho has the capabilities of bringing the one thing to Tottenham that Pochettino couldn't deliver.</p>
      <p>"But as I said if Jose wants to get back into top-level management, you look at his C.V., people question the Manchester United job, but you have to look at his career as a whole," Carragher told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"He’s been hugely successful and that is the one thing Tottenham lack at this moment, no matter how well Pochettino’s done.</p>
      <p>"They haven’t quite got over the line in getting a trophy and normally that’s what Jose Mourinho does when he goes to a club."</p>
      <p>Whilst Carragher has given Mourinho his backing, he would have loved to have seen him stay on in his part-time punditry role with Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>"Well I hope not because then he’d be out of our studio then," Carragher said ahead of Tottenham announcing Mourinho as their new boss. "There might be a bit of room for me then on Super Sunday, I can’t get in the Super Sunday studio at the moment with Jose and all that, there might be a bit of room for me, squad rotation.</p>
      <p>"But no I hope it’s not Jose to be honest, I think he’s been great on Sky and I’ve enjoyed listening to him, so fingers crossed it’s not him."</p>
