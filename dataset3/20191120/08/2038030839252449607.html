      <p>Cape Town - Music icon, Elton John has revealed how he underwent the successful operation two years ago but came close to death after falling ill on tour in South America.</p>
      <p>In an interview with world-famous talk show host Graham Norton <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2019/elton-john"><b>on a BBC programme,</b></a> titled <i>Elton John: Uncensored</i>, the famous pianist said: "I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was, 'Please don't let me die, I want to see my children', and luckily, I survived it."</p>
      <p>He went on: "Now I'm fine, but there's very few bits of me left. There's no hair, there's a pacemaker, there's no tonsils, there's no prostate, there's no appendix, I've had kidney stones. I'm like the Bionic Woman."</p>
      <p>The singer also explained how he was forced to wear nappies during a show in Las Vegas after the operation.</p>
      <p>He elaborated: "I was on stage in Vegas in a lot of pain, fluid had built up under my colon. I did the show and was wearing nappies shortly after the operation. I thought 'If only they knew right now that I'm pissing myself'."</p>
      <p>It makes sense then that after this world tour, the artist will end his working globetrotting days.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Music/News/elton-john-on-ending-his-touring-days-ive-had-a-good-run-20180125"><b>Back in 2018</b></a> he announced that this would be his last go around the world on stage, explaining in a statement, at an event in New York: "I've had a good run, I think you'd admit that..."</p>
      <p>Elton has a career some only dream of with one diamond, 38 platinum or multi-platinum, and 26 gold albums, over 50 top 40 hits, and he has sold more than 300 million records worldwide.   </p>
