        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> spoke in glowing terms of the rise of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> Hotspur, even when the Portuguese was in charge at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been confirmed as the new manager of Spurs on Wednesday morning after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> was sacked on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea, Real Madrid and Inter Milan boss brings a wealth of top level experience to north London, and also a lot of respect for the club he is joining.</p>
      <p>When in charge at Old Trafford, Mourinho was asked about the difficulties of signing players, and cited Spurs as a team you could no longer bully into selling their best players.</p>
      <p>‘Is Manchester United by its history, by its dimension, bigger than Tottenham? With all respect, Tottenham is an amazing club. I think everybody would say yes,’ Mourinho said in 2017.</p>
      <p>‘Can you buy Tottenham’s best players? No, because they don’t sell. Of course, they are so powerful that they can say no.</p>

      <p>‘A few years ago, who was Tottenham’s best player? Michael Carrick. And a few years later, who was the best player? Berbatov. Can we go there now and bring Harry Kane? Dele Alli, [Christian] Eriksen, Son [Heung-min]? Can we go there and bring those players here? No.</p>
      <p>‘So who is more powerful now? Them or us? Football’s changed. It’s more difficult to buy players of a high, high, high level. The clubs are more powerful. The clubs don’t want to sell, and to sell is to go to absolutely incredible levels.</p>
      <p>‘Before, the smaller clubs were almost begging the big clubs: “Get my best players. I need to sell. Please, you are powerful. Buy my best player.” At this moment, they don’t want to sell. They don’t want to sell.’</p>
