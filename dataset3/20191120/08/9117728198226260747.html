      <p>Gasly was promoted at the start of the season from Toro Rosso following his impressive 2018 season, dominating Brendon Hartley for the Red Bull junior squad. However, things didn't work out at Red Bull.</p>
      <p>The French driver was up against <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> and was completely dominated by a resurgent Dutchman during the first part of the campaign, and Red Bull lost their patience with him and demoted him back to Toro Rosso.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alexander Albon</a> came in to replace Gasly, and has the British-born Thai driver has impressed so much, he's earned himself the seat at Red Bull for the 2020 campaign, leaving Gasly with Toro Rosso for a further season.</p>

      <p>Gasly shocked the Formula 1 world on Sunday with a brilliant drive, recording his first-ever podium finish, with the 23-year-old in second-place, behind his former team-mate Verstappen in a crazy <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a>.</p>
      <p><i>"As a driver, you always want to be in the fastest car possible and fight as high up on the grid (as) possible," </i>Gasly said to <i>RaceFans. "But in Red Bull, it feels like we were 80 percent of the potential we had most of the races, for different reasons.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>"Since I joined Toro Rosso, this has changed a bit and every weekend and I feel I'm able to put stronger performances. This is of course more enjoyable. But ultimately, as a driver, you always want to be in the fastest car possible."</i>
