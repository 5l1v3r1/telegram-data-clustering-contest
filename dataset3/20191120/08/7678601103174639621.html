      <h1>Early Mozart minuets sell for 372,500 euros at Paris auction</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T08:06:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 08:06</time> by <a rel="author">The Jakarta Post</a></address>
      <p>An original score of two minuets composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart when he was just 16 blew past estimates at a Sotheby's auction in Paris on Monday, going under the hammer for 372,500 euros ($413,000).</p>
      <p>It was nearly double the top estimated value of 200,000 euros set for the handwritten score dating from 1772, and which formed part of the extensive music collection of a fellow Austrian, the writer Stefan Zweig.</p>
      <p>The unpublished, autographed score of the minuets -- a stylized dance -- contains a few corrections and minor modifications, including one or two that might be in the hand of Mozart's father, Leopold. </p>
      <p>The manuscript was kept in Mozart's birthplace Salzburg by the composer's sister, Nannerl, before finding its way into Zweig's collection. </p>

      <p>The score, the only one of the composer's "Six Minuets K.164" to still be in private hands, came from the library of the eminent Swiss bibliophile Jean-Francois Chaponniere.</p>
      <p>Mozart, a child prodigy, began composing at a very early age under his father's guidance. </p>
      <p>The sale comes ahead of an offering by rival auction house Christie's in Paris next week of a rare portrait of Mozart, made when the musical genius was just 13.</p>
      <p>The work, one of few Mozart paintings still in private hands, is expected to fetch 800,000 to 1.2 million euros.</p>
