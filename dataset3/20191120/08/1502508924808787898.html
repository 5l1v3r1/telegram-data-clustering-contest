      <p>Home Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-amit-shah">Amit Shah </a>on Wednesday said in Rajya Sabha that the government will restore Internet connection in <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kashmir">Kashmir </a>as soon as the local administration feels it is fit to do so.</p>
      <p>Responding to a series of questions on the situation in Jammu and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kashmir">Kashmir </a>during Question Hour, Shah also asserted that not a single person has died in police firing after August 5 when the special status accorded to Jammu and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/kashmir">Kashmir </a>was scrapped.</p>
      <p>He also said all newspapers and TV channels are functioning in Kashmir and there is no decline in circulation of newspapers.</p>
      <p>"The situation there was always normal. There were many notions spread all over the world. There is total normalcy prevailing. After August 5, not a single person has died in police firing although many feared there would be bloodshed and more number of killings," the Home Minister said.</p>
