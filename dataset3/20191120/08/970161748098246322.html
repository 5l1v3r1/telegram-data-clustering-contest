      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rebekah-vardy/">Rebekah Vardy</a> is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/27/rebekah-vardy-pregnant-with-fifth-child-her-third-with-footballer-jamie-vardy-10635179/">set to welcome her fifth child very soon</a>, with footballer husband Jamie.</p>
      <p>And the 37-year-old celebrated the little one in style after her sister threw a surprise baby shower.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the I’m A Celebrity star gave fans a glimpse into the sweet bash, complete with flowers, personalised balloons and cake-pops.</p>
      <p>Basically the dream afternoon.</p>
      <p>‘Such an amazing surprise…,’ she captioned a series of photos from the big day. ‘Thank you to my amazing Sister. Love you all xxxx.’</p>
      <p>And husband Jamie was among the first to praise the mum-to-be, sliding in to comment: ‘You deserve it xxxx.’</p>

      <p>Rebekah and Jamie are set to welcome their third child together, sharing daughter Sofia and son Finlay.</p>
      <p>While the WAG has two children, Megan and Taylor, from previous relationships, and the Leicester City footballer welcomed daughter Ella with ex Emma Daggett.</p>
      <p>Becky has had a tough few months, after finding herself engaged in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-fellow-wag-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-elaborate-plan-expose-10887652/">an almighty feud with Coleen Rooney</a> that basically broke the internet.</p>
      <p>It all kicked off when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-hinted-10-months-ago-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-10888481/">Wayne Rooney’s wife shared a bombshell post on Instagram</a> last month, accusing her pal of leaking stories about her to the press.</p>
      <p>In the post, which quickly went viral, she detailed how she planted fake posts on her private social media page – which were only viewable by Becky – in a bid to find out who had been selling the information.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/rebekah-vardy-slams-coleen-rooneys-claims-selling-stories-suggests-instagram-hacked-10887883/">her former pal fiercely denied she was the person behind the leak</a>, with famous faces from around the world weighing in on the drama.</p>
