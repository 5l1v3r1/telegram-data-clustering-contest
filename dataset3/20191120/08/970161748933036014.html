      <p>I was six years old when I was first told I was a sissy, because I threw a basketball ‘like a girl’.</p>
      <p>I remember blood rushing to my cheeks as loud laughter pierced through my body. I didn’t quite understand what I had done, but I remember feeling deeply embarrassed by something I had no control over.</p>
      <p>This is the first time I remember being bullied in school, and it continued throughout all my school years. Instead of being able to enjoy activities like the rest of my classmates, I felt forced to hide away and hold back out of fear of being ridiculed.</p>
      <p>I wish that back then there would have been more awareness about people like me. Then maybe I would have been able to be myself. Because I didn’t know why I was so different from everyone else, I just knew I didn’t fit it and I was deeply uncomfortable with how people saw me and responded to me.</p>

      <p>But thankfully things have changed. November is now officially marked as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/the-trans-community-needs-more-than-awareness-we-need-to-feel-safe-11078709/">Transgender Awareness Month</a> – a month dedicated to raising awareness of transgender people and their lives. It reaches its height on 20 November, which is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/20/trans-people-are-being-killed-action-must-be-taken-now-if-we-are-to-protect-the-next-generation-8158810/">Transgender Day of Remembrance</a>. The day is in honour of the transgender people whose lives have been taken, many of them simply for being transgender.</p>
      <p>Personally, I am always a bit cynical about days, weeks and months that are to raise ‘awareness’ about something. Not because I don’t want to celebrate and raise awareness, but because for me, awareness doesn’t begin and end on a calendar day. I live it every single day. <br/><br/>But, cynicism and exhaustion aside, Transgender Day of Remembrance is an important time of reflection for me.</p>
      <p>We are currently living in very polarised times. On the one hand, many countries, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/03/as-iceland-strengthens-trans-rights-hate-crime-in-the-uk-rises-we-should-be-ashamed-10101844/">such as Iceland,</a> are taking huge steps forward for transgender equality. Healthcare for transgender people is constantly evolving and improving, and people are able to come out and be themselves much sooner than they ever have. </p>
      <p>As someone who wasn’t able to come out when I was a kid, it is impossible to describe how happy I am for those who can. We are now seeing a whole generation of trans people who have never had to go through a traumatising puberty, making their lives so much better than the lives of previous generations. That’s tremendously positive for the wellbeing of young people.</p>
      <blockquote>Transgender people are people just like you, trying to make the best of what they’ve got</blockquote>
      <p>But, at the same time, transgender people are also facing huge challenges. </p>

      <p>In the UK, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=55199X1529169&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=13.25.1-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2Fsearch%2F%23gsc.tab%3D0%26gsc.q%3Dtransphobia%2B81%2525%26gsc.sort%3D&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Furl%3Fclient%3Dinternal-element-cse%26cx%3D012545676297898659090%3Awk87ya_pczq%26q%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fmetro.co.uk%2F2019%2F06%2F27%2Ftrans-hate-crimes-jump-by-81-in-a-year-with-300-rise-in-yorkshire-10078693%2F%26sa%3DU%26ved%3D2ahUKEwi_j6vrs_blAhWOfMAKHUnsAK4QFjAAegQIAxAC%26usg%3DAOvVaw0FRAI7i-tdrcIqdL2tTTUb&amp;xguid=01DSMX9926D4J5ZM1JG2402ME0&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=0&amp;xuuid=5cdac82853a9d8027d08c0394a45450c">hate crimes and transphobic harassment</a> has increased and waiting lists for trans-related healthcare are ludicrously long – waiting for a first appointment can take up to two years. All discussions about legal rights for trans people are hijacked by misleading and demoralising debates.</p>
      <p>The focus never gets to be on the real challenges trans people face in society, but rather on the perceived, often made-up issues we allegedly cause. It’s exhausting to have to constantly live in reaction to things that simply aren’t true.</p>
      <p>While most murders of trans people take place in South America, the UK is sadly no safe haven. In 2018, two two trans women, Naomi Hersi and Amy Griffith, were both murdered in the UK. Behind all the statistics and headlines are real people – people with hopes, dreams and aspirations just like everyone else.</p>
      <p>That’s why we have things like Transgender Awareness Month. It’s not because transgender people just love to keep banging on about themselves, but because we still have a long way to go. </p>
      <p>I would love nothing more than to be able to live my life in peace and not have to talk about being trans, but I simply can’t. My everyday life is constantly impacted by the fact that I am trans. We’re all in survival mode.</p>
      <p>We need to create a society where transgender people are free to be themselves without prosecution, harassment and bullying. I want to be able to walk down the street without worrying how someone might perceive me or what they might do if they know I’m trans. As Travis Alabanza recently wrote in their Metro.co.uk column, trans people need more than awareness, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/the-trans-community-needs-more-than-awareness-we-need-to-feel-safe-11078709/">we need to feel safe</a>. Everyone deserves that. </p>

      <p>Transgender people are your colleagues, your family members, your loved ones, and people you encounter on the street. We share this world with you, and we share hobbies, interests, jobs and values with you. Transgender people are people just like you, trying to make the best of what they’ve got. </p>
      <p>If you’re someone who’s reading this who isn’t trans, and you feel helpless hearing these stories, remember that you can make a difference. You can remember to be kind to transgender people. Believe transgender people. You can be critical of what you hear on the news and seek out information from transgender people instead.<br/><br/>You can speak up for us, elevate our voices by talking about and sharing our work, and challenge transphobia where you encounter it. You can educate your boomer relatives, or your colleague at work that said something rude about a trans person. It all counts.</p>
      <p>The 331 people that were murdered this year all had their own individual lives. They didn’t deserve to be killed. I feel helpless about it too, but I do know that it doesn’t have to be this way. <br/><br/>Together we can make a change. May they all rest in power.</p>
