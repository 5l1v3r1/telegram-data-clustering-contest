      </figure>
      <p>We are now just a few weeks away from the January transfer window opening for business.</p>
      <p>Nottingham Forest will join the rest of the Championship clubs looking to splash the cash on improving their squads.</p>
      <p>Fierce battles have emerged across the division already this season and signing players in January could be decisive in clubs achieving their goals towards the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p>As such, plenty of rumours are already floating around as the clubs plot their activity for the January window and we have gathered some of the latest snippets below from Nottingham and their rivals.</p>
      <p>Everton have been linked with a move for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> defender Matty Cash in recent days.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been in fine form for the Reds this season, being rated as the best right back in the division.</p>
      <p>Cash has reportedly caught the eye of Everton talent spotters who have been impressed with his versatility as both a midfielder and full back.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10359744/everton-nottingham-forest-matty-cash-january/">Reports in the national press</a> have suggested that the Toffees could be willing to part with £12m to acquire Cash's services in the upcoming window.</p>

        <b>Derby plotting move for 10-goal Blackpool ace</b>
      </p>
      <p>Derby County are looking to bolster their attacking ranks in January with a move for Blackpool striker Armand Gnanduillet, reports cited by Derbyshire Live state.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old sees his current deal at Bloomfield Road expire at the end of the season and his services have courted plenty of attention, as he has netted 10 goals so far this season in League One.</p>
      <p>Due to his contract situation, the French forward’s services could be available for a cut-price fee in the New Year but that could lead to Derby facing competition in the market.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wolves reignite interest in Reading striker</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wolves are preparing to re-launch their approach for Reading striker Danny Loader when the transfer window re-opens in January, Football League World states.</p>
      <p>The striker saw a Deadline Day move to Molineux fall through back in the summer and reports earlier this week stated that Manchester United had also joined the hunt for the teenager.</p>
      <p>Loader sees his deal expire at the end of the season, which could lead to Reading cashing in during the January transfer window in order to receive a fee for his services.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Markus Henriksen confirms transfer interest as Hull exit looms</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hull City are set to lose Markus Henriksen’s services when his contract expires at the end of the season and the Norway international has now confirmed interest in his services, reports cited by Sport Witness state.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has already turned down an extension with Hull and has not featured for the Tigers in the Championship so far this season, with the writing on the wall for the 27-year-old, and he’s spoken about the interest in his services.</p>
      <p>“We have to wait and see what happens. There has been a great deal of interest right now, so we’ll see what’s best for me and my family. I hope and believe that it can be something very good.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ex-club chief suggests Stoke City exit looms</b>
      </p>
      <p>Former Galatasaray sporting director Cenk Ergun has claimed that Trabzonspor are close to signing Badou Ndiaye from Stoke City, reports cited by Sport Witness declare.</p>
      <p>The Senegal international has been heavily linked with a move to Turkey on loan but Stoke are holding out for the best possible deal that they can secure for the 29-year-old, although Ergun states a deal is close to completion.</p>
      <p>“From first hand I’ve learned Trabzonspor are looking to loan Badou Ndiaye and he’s very close to moving there. However, Stoke City are looking to get as much as they can from the player because they know his value in Turkey. So they are in no rush.”</p>
