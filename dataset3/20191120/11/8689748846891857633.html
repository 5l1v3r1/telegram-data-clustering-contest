      <h1>VIDEO: ‘I’m Only Interested In Footballers Who Play For Big Teams Because Of Their Money’- Fantana</h1>

      <p>Fantana has carefully learnt that controversies bolster the brands of celebs in our industry and this is something we think she got from Bullet.</p>
      <p>The kind of utterances she makes and other subtle gimmicks she tosses in our face make us know she’s really positioning herself to trend.</p>
      <p>In a fresh interview with blogger Eugene Osafo Nkansah of Nkonkonsa news blog, Fantana stated that she’s only interested in footballers so she can squander their money.</p>
      <p>And by the way- not just any footballer but those who play for BIG teams like Arsenal, Real Madrid, Barcelona and the other famous clubs scattered across Europe.</p>
      <p>When Eugene asked her if money is all that matters to her and not love, the Rufftown signee said she’s definitely into the ‘kwacha’ than love.</p>
      <p>Her new stance is a bit surprising though as <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/revealed-fantana-and-danny-beatz-are-dating/">she recently professed her love for music producer cum artist, Danny Beatz of ‘Medekuku’ fame.</a></p>
