      <p>One person is dead and two others are listed in serious condition in hospital following separate collisions involving elk.</p>
      <p>Both collisions happened on Vancouver Island near Lake Cowichan.</p>
      <p>A woman from Lake Cowichan was killed after colliding head-on with another vehicle. Police tell<a href="https://vancouverisland.ctvnews.ca/"> CTV News Vancouver Island </a>they believe the crash occurred at 8 p.m. when one vehicle attempted to avoid the elk on the highway, instead the vehicle struck the elk and then collided with an oncoming vehicle. She was found dead on the scene a man and a woman in the other vehicle were air-lifted to hospital with life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>A second, separate crash happened early Wednesday morning at approximately 7 a.m. on Highway 18 also near Lake Cowichan, this time the driver was much luckier and managed to walk away from the crash with minor injuries.</p>
