      <h1>Deontay Wilder wears bizarre outfit ahead of heavyweight rematch with Luis Ortiz</h1>
      <h2>Wilder takes on Ortiz for a second time on Saturday when he defends his heavyweight world title in Las Vegas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:08:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:08</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder made quite the impression as he arrived in Las Vegas ahead of his heavyweight rematch with Luis Ortiz.</p>
      <p>The world champion defends his title against Ortiz on Saturday night, 18 months since he was rocked by the Cuban before stopping the 40-year-old in the 10th round.</p>
      <p>And as he arrived bare-chested in Sin City, Wilder promised to finish the job in double-quick time.</p>
      <p>"We're all here to see what's going to happen on Saturday night," he said.</p>
      <p>"Even though I knocked Ortiz out the first time, it was an amazing fight. That was the fight that I was challenged the most during. I understand why none of the other heavyweights want to fight Ortiz.</p>
      <p>"He's very dangerous and I blessed him with a second chance.</p>

      <p>"Fans always get their money's worth when I'm on the big stage because people know what I'm able to do to another human being inside of that ring. I can't wait for Saturday night."</p>
      <p>Ortiz has recorded three routine victories since he lost to Wilder - his first and only defeat as a professional.</p>
      <p>And despite his advancing years, he is confident of upsetting the odds.</p>
      <p>"<a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/deontay-wilder">Deontay Wilder</a> is a throwback fighter like me, and we both want to fight the best," he said.</p>

      <p>"I believe I'm the best and that's why I'm getting this rematch. I'm focused on this fight and this fight only and doing everything to have my hand raised Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"My life has changed tremendously and for the better since I came to the United States from Cuba.</p>
      <p>"Being in the US has allowed me to focus on my two dreams, finding a cure for my daughter's disease and becoming heavyweight champion of the world. That's always been my mission."</p>
