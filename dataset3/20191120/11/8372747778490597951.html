      <p>LARIMER COUNTY, Colo. – A former teacher who worked for two school districts in northern Colorado <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/crime/former-northern-colorado-teacher-arrested-on-multiple-child-sex-crime-charges">was arrested last week</a> on suspicion of multiple child sex crimes, a spokesperson with the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Daniel Gerschitz Fleishman, 38, was arrested on Nov. 15 following a month-long investigation by the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office Investigation Division, which had received a tip from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>
      <p>During a search warrant of his home, deputies seized several computers and cell phones which led to his arrest, officials with the sheriff’s department said in a news release.</p>
      <p>Fleishman, who was booked into the Larimer County Jail, was booked on the following charges:</p>
      <p>Sexual exploitation of a child – production of child abuse material, sexual exploitation of a child – possession of more than 20 images of child abusive materials, sexual exploitation of a child – possession of more than one video of child abusive material; unlawful electronic sexual communications by one in a position of trust; sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust; and invasion of privacy for sexual gratification.</p>
      <p>Deputies said some of the allegations happened while Fleishman was working for two northern Colorado districts: Poudre Schools, in which he worked as a substitute teacher from 2008 to 2016, and the Thompson School District, where he was also a substitute teacher from 2009 to 2016. Investigators said Fleishman was a full-time teacher at Thompson from 2016-2018.</p>
      <p>Anyone who may have information about Fleishman’s alleged crimes is asked to call the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office investigator Justin Atwood at (970) 498-5143 or Crime Stoppers at (970) 221-6868. You can remain anonymous and be eligible for a crash reward.</p>
