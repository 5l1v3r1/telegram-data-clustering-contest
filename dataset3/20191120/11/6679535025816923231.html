      <h1>The Language of Birds: Fluttering delight</h1>
      <h2>The Corvids are discussing the Parlez-Vous of Birds, when they are disturbed by an incessant knocking. We begin a series this week.</h2>

      <p>“There’s going to be a <i>Parlez-</i>Vous <i>of Birds </i>next month at Bali,” announced Mr. Corvid at the dining table.</p>
      <p>He was busy eating from a bowl of wriggling rain-flies. They had come out after the first rain.</p>
      <p>“I really hate these single use wings, so plastic,” cawed Mr. Corvid ripping each pair with his crow-claws.</p>
      <p>He arranged them in a neat pile on his side-plate. Mr. Corvid was a lawyer amongst crows. He liked to place things in a neat file wherever he was.</p>
      <p>“What’s a <i>Parlez-Vous of Birds</i>?” asked Mrs. Corvid popping some of the peeled rain-flies into her mouth.</p>
      <p>“It’s a gathering of birds. In ancient Persia it was called ‘The Conference of Birds’ by the poet Attar of Nishapur. The birds of that time were worried that the world had become a dangerous place. There was no rain. Forest fires destroyed ancient forestlands. Groups of sharp-beaked falcons and eaglets raided the farms and picked up newborn lambs. They even ate the eggs from their own nests. The meeting of birds made a decision. They had to find the mysterious bird-woman called the Simurgh.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, the one who lived in a Tree,” remarked Mrs. Corvid.</p>
      <p>“Well, most birds do live in a tree,” began Mr. Corvid.</p>
      <p>“Not hens,” Mrs. Corvid pointed out. She always liked to get a word in. She was beginning to start on water birds and waders with their large spidery feet, when Mr. Corvid gave her one of his looks.</p>
      <p>“The Simurgh lived in the Tree of Knowledge connecting the Earth and Sky. When she wanted to scratch herself, she shook the branches of the Tree. And the seeds floated across the world to become the plants that cover the earth.”</p>

      <p>“Peck, peck, peck,” came the sound of the Hoopoe knocking on the bark outside their Raintree. He was from their local courier service. He wore a pleated cloth fan in red on his turbaned head, with a dull gold bag over his striped black and white uniform. In some areas he was known as a woodpecker.</p>
      <p>“Tap.Tap.Tap.” He went restlessly. He was always in a hurry to get to the next place.</p>
      <p>Trapeza, the neighbourly spider descended from a silken rope hanging from a high branch. “Ring the bell, like the rest of us,” she advised twirling herself in front of his beak like a ballerina.</p>
      <p>“Swipe” went the Hoopoe.</p>
      <p>“Hoopoe alert. He’s here early,” trilled Trapeza, before working her way up the silken rope into a crack in the wood.</p>
