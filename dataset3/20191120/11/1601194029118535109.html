      <p>Stefan Savic has suffered a setback as he bids to return from a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>The Atletico Madrid centre-back has been out of action since Montenegro's 0-0 draw against Bulgaria in Euro 2020 qualifying on October 11.</p>
      <p>Atleti announced Savic, who was substituted after 39 minutes of that match, had suffered a hamstring issue but did not offer an estimated recovery time.</p>
      <p>And the club announced on Wednesday the defender "suffered a relapse of the grade II injury".</p>
      <p>Savic has undergone tests and, according to Atleti's short statement, "is pending response to treatment".</p>
