        <b>Jorja Smith will be doing her bit for charity in the run up to Christmas by performing a charity gig for Shelter.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Be Honest singer will raise awareness for the rise in homelessness around the festive holiday with a performance at London’s Union Chapel on Monday 9 December.</p>
      <p>Sharing her anticipation ahead of the performance, Jorja said in a statement: ‘I’m thrilled to perform at this year’s Shelter music gig, at such an iconic and intimate venue, and help raise money that supports the amazing work the charity does fighting homelessness.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone should have a safe place to call home and buying a ticket will make a massive difference to people facing homelessness this Christmas.’</p>
      <p>Tickets cost £45 and will be allocated on a ballot basis. Every penny will go towards Shelter’s work helping those struggling with homelessness and poor housing conditions with around 320,000 people currently homeless in the UK.</p>

So, money raised from ticket sales will help us provide vital advice and support for people facing the misery of homelessness this festive season.’</p>

      <p>Must be nice this time of year.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Harper’s Bazaar, Jorja explained: ‘I really liked it, but I hadn’t written it, so I didn’t connect to the lyrics. But then I split up with my boyfriend of the time and I listened back to the song and understood it.</p>
      <p>‘So, it worked out well. But you can’t just do stuff for the hell of it, you genuinely have to love what you’re doing.’</p>
