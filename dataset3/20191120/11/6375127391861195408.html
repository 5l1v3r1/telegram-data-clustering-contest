      <h3>A TRAFFIC enforcer from the  Manila Traffic and Parking Bureau (MTPB) was ordered sacked by Mayor Isko Moreno, with a reiterated warning to all employes of the local government that there is no room for illegal activities in the city.</h3>
      <p>Moreno directed MTPB chief Dennis Viaje to take back the uniform and identification card of the said enforcer, identified as Modesto Tabion Tadeo Jr.,assigned at the MTPB Sector 5.</p>
      <p>Viaje said Tadeo was caught on video while accepting bribe from a motorist on November 18, at the corner of United Nations and Taft Avenue in Manila. Said video was posted on social media by netizen Love Laurena.</p>
      <p>Moreno said he is highly disappointed that the incident came a day after traffic enforcer Mc Adrian Lim, 21, showed dedication to duty to the point of risking his life. Lim was videotaped hanging on to a door of a vehicle while the motorist, who eluded being issued a ticket for a traffic violation, sped off and tried to shake him off.</p>
      <p>The mayor publicly commended Lim and had him regularized. Lim is a job order personnel and Viaje is now seeking a permanent item for him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Moreno announced that the Manila Health Department (MHD) under its chief Dr. Arnold ‘Poks’ Pangan, will begin the city’s third round of polio vaccination drive next week, from November 25 to December 7.</p>
      <p>Pangan said the vaccination will be held in barangay halls alongside the  house-to-house vaccine drive of field personnel and volunteers.</p>
