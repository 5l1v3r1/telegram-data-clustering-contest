      <p>Sidharth Malhotra and Tara Sutaria collaborated for the first time in their latest release Marjaavaan and that added to the buzz around the film for sure. The two B-town hotties made their debut with Dharma Productions’ Student of the Year franchise. While Sidharth was in the first part, Tara stepped into the world of glamour in the second part of the film. Their latest release Marjaavaan received mixed reviews from the critics but it hasn’t stopped the audience from going and watching this duo’s chemistry on the big screen. The film has action, drama and romance which makes it a total Bollywood masala entertainer. </p>

      <p>On its first day, the film earned Rs 7.03 crore followed by Rs 7.21 crore on Saturday, Rs 10.18 crore on Sunday, Rs 4.15 crore on Monday and Rs 3.61 crore on Tuesday making the total an Rs 32.18 crore. The film is doing fairly well for itself at the cash counters and we hope it continues to do so. Directed by Milap Zaveri, Marjaavaan’s songs too have caught the attention of the audience.</p>
