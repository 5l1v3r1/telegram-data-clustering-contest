      <h3>ALASKA leaned on a sustained offensive to bring down NLEX, 106-90, and clinch the  last quarterfinal slot in the 2019 PBA Governors’ Cup on Wednesday at the Ynares Center, Antipolo.</h3>
      <p>The Aces sized up the Road Warriors in the first quarter before they caught fire and seized momentum in the second quarter which they gamely sustained on the way to the big victory.</p>
      <p>With their fourth straight win, the Aces finished the elimination round tied with NorthPort for seventh and eighth slots at 5-6. However, the Aces clinched the number 7 slot and relegated the Batang Pier to number 8 by virtue of the winner-over-the-other rule. Alaska defeated NorthPort back in the elimination.</p>
      <p>The Road Warriors struggled to regain the momentum they lost following last week’s 102-94 loss to NorthPort, but still could not seem to find their rhythm in the face of the more aggressive Aces.</p>
      <p>The Road Warriors thus lost their last two outings in the elimination and ended up at 8-3 in a tie with Meralco in the provisional standings. A three-way tie for the first place was still possible with Talk ‘N Text, which was still playing San Miguel Beer at press time.</p>
      <p>No matter what the result of the TNT-SMB game, the Road Warriors still took the top seeding via quotient system since they had defeated both the Bolts (105-99, Sept 17) and the KaTropa (126-113, Oct 25).</p>
      <p>Also eliminated out of the playoff picture as a result of the Alaska win was Columbian Dyip whose 4-7 slate would have made them in contention via plyoff had the Aces lost.</p>
      <p>A hard drive by Maverick Ahanmisi gave the Aces a 74-60 lead with three minutes left in the third. They stretched it to 81-65 at the end of the period after a brief scoring binge capped by Jayvee Casio’s triple.</p>
      <p>From there, it was a show by Alaska, which posted a 90-70 lead with still nine minutes remaining in the fourth. The Road Warriors tried their luck by going for three-pointers which never came.</p>
      <p>The scores:</p>
      <p>Alaska (106) - House 24, Casio 12, Racal 12, Tratter 12, Manuel 10, Herndon 10, Ahanmisi 8, Enciso 7, Ayaay 4, Brondial 4, Thoss 3, Galliguez 0.</p>
      <p>NLEX (90) - Harris 22, Quinahan 17, Ravena 15, Ighalo 5, Soyud 4, Paniamogan 4, Miranda 2, Cruz 2, Alas 0, Fonacier 0.</p>
      <p>Quarterscores: 33-23, 63-46, 81-65, 106-90.</p>
