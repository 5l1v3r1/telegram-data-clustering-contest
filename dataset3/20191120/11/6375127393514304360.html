      <h3>TWO Chinese fugitives wanted by authorities in their country for involvement in economic crimes were arrested by the Bureau of Immigration (BI).</h3>
      <p>The two, identified as Chen Yanhua, 56 and Xu Xiaojun, 34, were arrested separately on Sunday and yesterday, respectively, by operatives from the bureau’s fugitive search unit (FSU) headed by Bobby Raquepo.</p>
      <p>Raquepo said Chen was nabbed at a five-star hotel in Parañaque City by virtue of a deportation warrant based on tipped information on her whereabouts and the conduct of intensive surveillance on her activities for several days.</p>
      <p>According to BI spokesperson Dana Sandoval, Chen will be deported as her passport was already cancelled by the Chinese government, making her an undocumented alien, adding that Chen is also an undesirable alien due to her record as a wanted fugitive.</p>
      <p>Sandoval said Chen was one of seven Chinese fugitives whose arrest and deportation was sought by their government in September last year for alleged involvement in economic crimes.</p>
      <p>The Chinese embassy told the BI that Chen and her cohorts defrauded 13 of their compatriots who were enticed to invest their money amounting to seven million yuan or roughly a million dollars on the promise that their deposits would earn profits and interest.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Raquepo said Xu was arrested yesterday in a restaurant in Baclaran, Parañaque.</p>
      <p>Xu, he said, is wanted by authorities in China for allegedly engaging in bank card fraud in his country, making an illegal profit amounting to millions of Yuans in damages.</p>
