      <h1>ECB's Makhlouf: Macroeconomic outlook mixed, seeing protracted weakness in euro area</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:09:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>The macroeconomic outlook is mixed and protracted weakness in <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> area is expected, Central Bank of Ireland Governor and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) policymaker, Gabriel Makhlouf, said on Wednesday. </p>
      <p>"Both hard and soft data for the second half of the year point to continuing, moderate growth," Makhlouf added and noted that external risks, including the ongoing possibility of a disorderly <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a>, were heightened at the moment. "Brexit represents an enormous change – and transition – for the citizens of Ireland."</p>
      <p>The EUR/USD pair seems to be edging lower after these comments and was last seen trading at 1.1060, erasing 0.15% on a daily basis.</p>
