      <p>This courgette salad is quick and easy to make. It's the perfect starter to serve at dinner if you don't have a lot of time on your hands. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 20 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six as a starter</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 yellow courgettes</li>
        <li>2 green courgettes</li>
        <li>1 head of sweetcorn</li>
        <li>150ml olive oil, plus a splash for frying</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped garlic</li>
        <li>4 cured anchovies, chopped</li>
        <li>2 tsp capers, rinsed lightly</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mixture of chopped basil, parsley, marjoram and mint</li>
        <li>Squeeze of lemon juice and freshly grated zest to serve</li>
        <li>200g Westcombe ricotta</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C gan/Gas 4.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill pan. Wash the courgettes and slice them in half lengthways with a large knife.</li>
        <li>Depending on the size of your grill pan you may need to cut them in half again. Score the inside of the courgettes in a criss cross pattern. Season them well.</li>
        <li>Add some olive oil to the grill pan and grill the courgettes until nicely charred.</li>
        <li>When ready, drizzle with a little oil, scatter with the garlic and finish the courgettes off in then oven for about 15 minutes until soft. I always add a splash of water as this stops the courgettes sticking to the tray.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile make the salsa. Remove the corn kernels from the husk with a large knife – when they are at the peak of the season there is no need to cook them.</li>
        <li>Toss the kernels with the 150ml olive oil, chopped anchovies and capers. Check the seasoning and then add the chopped herbs. Mix well, adding a squeeze of lemon to finish.</li>
        <li>To serve, place the cooked courgettes in a dish and cover with the salsa. Scatter over the ricotta and then grate some fresh lemon zest over the whole dish.</li>
      </ol>
