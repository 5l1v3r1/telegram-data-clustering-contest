      <h1>Bayern Munich star Joshua Kimmich launches Mauricio Pochettino charm offensive</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by Tottenham and linked with the vacant post at Bayern Munich - and Joshua Kimmich has labelled the Argentine a 'top coach'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:29:01+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:29</time> by <a rel="author">James Whaling, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-whaling/</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has only been out of a job for a matter of hours - but that has not stopped rumours swirling over where he might end up next.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich are on the lookout for a new permanent boss having axed Niko Kovac following their 5-1 humbling at the hands of Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>They are currently under the caretaker charge of Hansi Flick until the end of 2019 and have so far beaten Olympiacos 2-0 and Borussia Dortmund 4-0 under his stewardship.</p>
      <p>Joshua Kimmich was asked about the possibility of Pochettino becoming Bayern boss - and while he was diplomatic about what might happen - he labelled the Argentine a 'top coach'.</p>

      <p>“I do not know if he is a candidate for us,” he told reporters after Germany's 6-1 victory over Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>“What you can say is that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> were fighting at the top for years, they had brilliant consistency.</p>
      <p>“He’s a top coach, but I don’t know if he is an option for us."</p>
      <p>On Flick's spell in charge so far, Kimmich added: "In the first two games, it has worked well. I guess we will stay with it at least until Christmas – I do not see a new candidate now.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino spent five and a half years in charge of Spurs, winning 159 of his 293 games, and led them to the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>He has been replaced by Jose Mourinho who is back in a Premier League dugout after being sacked by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> last December.</p>
