      <h1>Snapchat Says It'll Attempt to Moderate and Fact-Check Political Ads</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:30:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Gary Cutlack</a></address>
      <p>Snapchat's boss has said he's about to ask staff to fact-check any political adverts that their backers want to appear on the platform, with the company's CEO Evan Spiegel setting up an internal team to monitor and approve all ads that appear to be coming from official campaigning sources.</p>
      <p>As you may be imagining right now, political adverts on Snapchat are not exactly a huge issue. The company's own figures for the US market show that it received just $1,175 (£900) for adverts displayed on behalf of potential US presidential candidate Joe Biden, which earned 281,894 views. How many of those views were of eyes actually paying attention and reading the message, it does not say.</p>
      <p>A CSV file of all political ads the network has run over the last two years <a href="https://www.snap.com/en-GB/political-ads">is available too</a>, if you want to investigate US political spending for something to do today.
