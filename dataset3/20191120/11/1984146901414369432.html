      <h2>Sunderland welcomes business and businesses are increasingly appreciating the attractions of the city, says Leader of Sunderland City Council, Councillor Graeme Miller</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:44:52+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">Evening Chronicle</a></address>
      <p>As I pen these lines for The Journal’s Top 200, I haven’t been made privy yet to who is going be at the top of this year’s North East 200 field.</p>
      <p>However, one thing I can predict is that Sunderland is going to be up there in the listings for public companies as it continues to host regional giants Nissan and Arriva and, in private companies, there is another name that continues to grow – Hays Travel.</p>
      <p>The travel and tourism industry is one of the world’s largest and so it is a source of great pride for me and so many people in Sunderland that home-grown Hays continues to seek and acquire new markets and opportunities. Hays is a major player in our city’s economy with its HQ and many hundreds of staff based here in Sunderland. In recent years it has branched out of our region and into new territories and, with its recent news about acquiring parts of the old Thomas Cook chain, we wish everyone at Hays the very best.</p>

      <p>We are all aware of Sunderland’s and, indeed, our region’s strengths in the automotive sector and for a look to the future I would suggest readers think about the construction work to the west of the A19 where the International Advanced Manufacturing Park (IAMP) is taking shape.</p>
      <p>It’s now more than five years since Sunderland City Council and South Tyneside Council outlined plans for the IAMP as a 7,000 job creating and 150 hectare game-changing development that the Government recognised as being ‘nationally significant’. The IAMP sits across both Sunderland and South Tyneside and is alongside one of our key transport assets, the A19. The tenants are arriving at this £400m development and IAMP is at the heart of how this region is creating more and better jobs through innovation-led growth in smart and sustainable manufacturing. The Centre for Excellence in Sustainable Advanced Manufacturing (CESAM) is moving to park, ensuring that skills needed to power these fast-paced businesses continue to be met.</p>
      <p>Sunderland has several strong economic drivers from the business parks at Rainton and Doxford; the manufacturing and logistics chain across Washington; the growing number of SMEs; the IT and software sector that has gone from a virtual standing start ten years ago to now employing more than 6,000 people and boasting the second highest rate of growth in turnover in the UK outside London; to the financial and customer services sector where blue-chip brands and big names continue to make repeat investments as they benefit from our city’s expert and loyal workforce.</p>
      <p>Our city plays host to many big names in business from Barclays, Berghaus, Citygroup, EDF and TSB, among others, and this summer we were very pleased to announce another big name as home delivery company Ocado was confirmed as the first tenant for THE BEAM. This is a flagship building on the city centre’s former Vaux Brewery site, bringing 300 new jobs to Sunderland.</p>
      <p>It’s just the start of our ambition for the city centre, and more big announcements will be made in the coming weeks as we deliver on a vision to create a magnet city centre that is a genuine economic motor for Sunderland.</p>

      <p>We’ve been laying the foundations for this kind of city centre transformation for some years now and we’re looking forward to seeing our ambitions realised as we work closely with the private sector. As with previous developments in Sunderland, whether that’s been Nissan, Doxford, IAMP or the Northern Spire crossing over the Wear, the council is playing a key role in the partnerships that are building a stronger, more dynamic and vibrant Sunderland.</p>
      <p>And we’re not stopping at the city centre. One of our prime assets is our stunning seaside, and the work of our city development team means that we have now attracted major investment to create an exciting mixed-use destination at Seaburn. This is a whole city that’s transforming… and our relationships with the private sector are fuelling this.</p>
      <p>This is a council that understands business and one that has always looked to welcome business.</p>
      <p>Large or small, this council works with business and by the time you read this we will have made another exciting announcement from our city on it becoming an even bigger engine and magnet for economic and business activity over the next ten years.</p>
      <p>I look forward to telling you even more about investment, growth and job creation in Sunderland over the coming months.</p>
