      <p>Actor Ralf Little said he has been suspended from Twitter after changing his account to mimic the Conservative Party press office.</p>
      <p>The Tories came under fire for rebranding one of their official Twitter accounts as a “fact-checking service” during Tuesday night’s televised election debate.</p>
      <p>Twitter warned that a repeat of the incident would result in “decisive corrective action”.</p>

      <p>However, on Wednesday morning a number of celebrities re-branded their verified accounts.</p>
      <p>Royle Family actor Ralf Little changed his name to “Conservative Party Press Orifice” and the description to “Not a fact checker. Or the Conservative Press Office”.</p>
      <p>He told LBC’s James O’Brien: “Just been logged out of my Twitter account without explanation. Assume I’ve been suspended. Which is fine. But only if the @CCHQPress account is suspended for the same thing. Please continue to press the issue with Twitter in my absence.”</p>
      <p>He was not the only verified celebrity to rebrand his account.</p>
      <p>Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker changed his account to mimic factcheckUK, as did The Thick Of It and Veep creator Armando Iannucci.</p>

      <p>The Electoral Commission – the official elections watchdog – issued a warning following the incident, saying voters were entitled to expect “transparency and integrity” from campaigners.</p>
      <p>However, senior party figures brushed off the controversy, saying it was part of their “instant rebuttal” mechanism to challenge “nonsense” claims made during the debate.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Twitter said: “Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK General Election.</p>
      <p>“We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts.</p>
      <p>“Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information – in a manner seen during the UK election debate – will result in decisive corrective action.”</p>
