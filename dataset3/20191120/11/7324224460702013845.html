      <p>Luke Ireland "completely lost his head" after he spotted his ex and her new partner in their silver Vauxhall Corsa by chance, a jury heard.</p>
      <p>There were two children travelling with the couple, one of whom had been fathered by the 32-year-old defendant, and he was allegedly taunted by his ex girlfriend when their car drew alongside his distinctive yellow Fiat Punto in Pelsall on June 9, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told.</p>
      <p>It was claimed that he used it "like a weapon" during the pursuit that followed down the High Street and into Ashtree Road before crashing into the other vehicle twice after which he left the scene.</p>
      <p>Nobody was physically injured but his former partner was so alarmed she had thought of throwing herself out of the Corsa to draw attention away from the other occupants.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed Hafeez, prosecuting, claimed: "Whether it was out of jealousy or anger, the defendant flipped and completely lost control.</p>
      <p>"He decided to chase his ex-partner and drive them off the road, that is what he intended to do.</p>
      <p>"He drove into the back of them with some force.</p>
      <p>"The defendant was described as being really angry when they looked in the rear mirror."</p>
      <p>Ireland denied attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to the couple but admitted dangerous driving, having neither insurance nor valid licence and breaching a non molestation order imposed two months earlier banning any contact with his ex.</p>
      <p>He told the court: "I was a bit emotional. I don't know what was in my mind. She was tormenting me from their car. I was sad and probably angry. I wanted to confront and scare them. As soon as I hit them I wanted to stop it."</p>
      <p>Mr Stephen Cadwaladr, defending, conceded: "He drove in a ludicrous and dangerous manner but intended to frighten not harm them. He would not have left the scene knowing that nobody had been injured if he was determined to cause really serious injury."</p>
      <p>The jury acquitted Ireland of attempting to cause GBH and he was jailed for the other offences by Judge Michael Challinor who told him: "This was a truly terrifying incident for the occupants of the other car.</p>
      <p>"They said they thought they were going to be killed and she was so desperate she considered jumping from the moving car to distract you.</p>
      <p>"You twice rammed a vehicle carrying the person you were prohibited from having any contact with.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult to think of a worse breach."</p>
      <p>The judge issued a fresh restraining order banning any contact with either of the couple for the next five years.</p>
