        <b>Retailers are really starting to gear up for the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019-uk-deals-3629166">best Black Friday deals</a>. Right now, you can get this 65″ Philips Ambilight Smart 4K TV, with Ultra HD, from Currys PC World for only £629.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The RRP for this Philips 65PUS6814/12 TV is £899, so this is a sizeable saving of almost £300.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, Amazon are offering the same price, but Currys have a far more impressive offering when it comes to extras. They’re throwing in a two year guarantee, free delivery and six months of Spotify Premium. You’ll  also have the option of adding on a Google Nest Mini for only £10.</p>
      <p>If you’re unfamiliar with Philips TVs, the 65PUS6814/12 boasts the brand’s three-sided Ambilight technology which casts the TV’s on-screen colours to the wall behind it. The panel used is a Direct Lit LED VA (Vertical Alignment) screen and that should allow for deeper blacks, better contrast and better viewing opportunities from wider angles.</p>

      <p>The idea behind this technology is about making viewer, or gamer, more immersed in their entertainment experience. When you’re gearing up for a film you’ve been looking forward to, maybe you’ll turn off the lights and the Ambilight TV will see the colours from the film leak into the room with you.</p>
      <p>The TV also has Amazon Alexa built-in, so you’ll be able to control the set with your voice, by issuing commands.</p>
      <p>So, if you’re hunting for a new TV and you’d like it to come with a good suite of features, this Philips set could be a great choice. It’s got all the usual smart TV features, making it easy to access your favourite streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.</p>
      <p>The Ambilight technology makes for an interesting, immersive experience and on top of all that, it’s great to get Spotify Premium and a cheap Google Nest Mini bundled into the deal. Plus, with Currys’ price promise guarantee, you won’t to worry about finding a better deal next week.</p>
