      <p>If you wanted to know how Demi Rose was doing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/model-demi-rose-claps-back-trolls-awkward-runway-walk-goes-viral-parents-just-died-11125893/">following a mighty unnecessary trolling last week</a>, look no further than Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The model donned her best sheer dress, burned the bra (hear hear, sister), whacked on a pair of Louboutins and headed to the Skinny Tan Choc launch at London’s Madison rooftop.</p>
      <p>And, quite frankly, she rocked the return.</p>
      <p>Wearing a black mini dress despite it being ruddy freezing in the capital, she shunned the haters and potential frostbite on her exposed extremities to ring in the launch alongside the likes of Lottie Moss and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arabella-chi/">Arabella Chi</a>.</p>

      <p>A resurfaced clip showed Demi struggling to maintain her balance in the skyscraper heels and after seeing the cruel reaction to the video, Demi addressed the criticism and explained how she pushed herself to take part after the heartbreaking deaths of her parents just eight months apart.</p>
      <p>Demi’s father, Barrie Mawby, died in October 2018, while her mother Christine passed away in June.</p>
      <p>Explaining her awkward walk, Demi told her Twitter followers: ‘All jokes aside yes I’m not the best runway model.</p>
      <p>‘I was super nervous, didn’t want to do it, my top went missing backstage, my shoes were too big for me in height and size not to mention I was dealing with personal issues loosing my parents, my mom a month before [sic].’</p>
      <p>Addressing her devastating loss, the model continued: ‘I wanted to push myself out of my comfort zone, make them and myself proud and that takes a lot of bravery, so for that I’m proud of myself because there’s a lot that wouldn’t have done it. But it’s done now. I can laugh too but I’m still here and it’s all Gucccci! [sic]’</p>

      <p>Ever positive, Demi said: ‘In hindsight it was a really fun experience, showcasing my own collection which I was really proud of. I’m really grateful for all the opportunities I’ve got given. Thank you to those who support me! [sic]’</p>
