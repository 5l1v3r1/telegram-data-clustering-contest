      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:55:57+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>An apprentice chef has been found not guilty of murdering a burglar and convicted rapist he found inside his Newcastle home.</p>
      <p>A Newcastle Supreme Court jury on Wednesday accepted Benjamin Batterham’s claim he was making a citizen’s arrest in March 2016 when he chased Ricky Slater, tackled him, put him in a chokehold and repeatedly punched him in the head until police arrived.</p>
      <p>The jury found Mr Batterham, 35, who <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/state/nsw/2016/03/28/man-charged-murder-suspected-thief/">spent two months in prison after his arrest before being granted bail</a>, not guilty of murder and the lesser charge of manslaughter.</p>

      <p>Mr Slater – who had scarring to his heart because of regular drug use, suffered liver disease and was obese – suffered a cardiac arrest following the attack but was revived by paramedics.</p>
      <p>Mr Slater had another two cardiac arrests in hospital and died the next day.</p>
      <p>The defence insisted throughout the trial that Mr Batterham never intended to kill Mr Slater or cause him serious harm.</p>
