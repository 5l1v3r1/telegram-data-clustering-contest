      <h1>Black Friday Sales Mean You Can Get £100 off the Lego Death Star and Millennium Falcon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:00:32+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2017/11/today-is-probably-the-only-day-youll-get-the-lego-death-star-for-a-more-reasonable-price/">A couple of years ago</a> we wrote about Lego knocking 20% (£82) off the £410 Lego Death Star for Black Friday, specifically mentioning that this was probably as cheap as it was going to get. Turns out we were dead wrong, <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/lego-and-bricks/lego-star-wars/lego-75159-star-wars-death-star-iconic-construction-set/p/156074">because Smyths has gone and made us have to eat our words in public.</a></p>
      <p>So if you held off on buying the Lego Death Star up until now, you are in for a treat, because Smyths has knocked £100 off the giant set, which is a 24.3% discount. In other words don't I feel a fool for paying £328 and only getting two years of Lego fun in exchange. Woe is me!</p>
      <p>Well I have no regrets, but if you do regret not picking up the Death Star before, now is the perfect chance to do it. It's not available for online delivery, as is the way with many large discounted Lego sets at Smyths, but you can click and collect it in your local branch.</p>
      <p>A quick scan of the list shows that there is at least one box in each one, and in most cases two or three. Watford has six, if you're willing to make a trip to what Londoners think is the North.</p>
      <p>Of course if the Death Star is not for you, Smyths has also <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/lego-and-bricks/lego-star-wars/lego-75192-star-wars-millennium-falcon-collector-set/p/168282">knocked £100 off the Ultimate Collector's Edition Millenium Falcon</a> for the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2018/11/smyths-has-knocked-100-off-legos-enormous-ucs-millennium-falcon-all-thanks-to-black-friday/">second year running</a>. And that is available for home delivery if you can't be bothered traipsing down to a physical shop.</p>
      <p>Of course you're more than welcome to wait, because Lego itself will be knocking 30 per cent off selected sets <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/lego-black-friday-sales-2019/">for the Pre-Black Friday VIP weekend</a>. 30 is more than 24, though we have no idea whether the company will discount either set by so much.</p>
      <p>But since that's this weekend, there may well still be Death Stars in stock at Smyths, so it's not the worst gamble in the world.</p>
