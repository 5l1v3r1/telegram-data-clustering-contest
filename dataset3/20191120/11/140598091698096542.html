      <p>This Spanish omelette is an alternative to bubble and squeak, with the addition of eggs. The traditional Spanish omelette would have chorizo and red peppers and so on, but there’s no reason you can’t sweat a couple of onions off until they’ve got a good sweetness and then make it with leftover Christmas veg. Make sure you’ve got a deep frying pan and use plenty of oil and butter. Pep it up with garlic, or serve with horseradish.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 25 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>50g butter</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely sliced</li>
        <li>400g leftover cooked vegetables such as potatoes, parsnips, carrots, cut into even-sized pieces</li>
        <li>Pinch of dried chilli</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>8 eggs</li>
        <li>A handful of mixed chopped herbs such as chives, parsley and tarragon</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METeasHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Melt half of the butter in a large non-stick, ovenproof frying pan. Mine is 24cm across.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onion and cook for 10 minutes until it is soft and starting to caramelise.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the butter along with the vegetables and mix well with the onion and some seasoning.</li>
        <li>Add the chilli and garlic and cook for a further two minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the grill and beat the eggs together in a jug.</li>
        <li>Pour the eggs over the vegetables and cook over the hob so that the base of the omelette starts to set, then place the pan under the grill.</li>
        <li>Cook for five minutes or until the top is golden brown – check it’s done underneath by lifting the omelette carefully with a palette knife.</li>
        <li>I like it when the omelette is slightly runny in the centre. Serve immediately, scattered with fresh herbs.</li>
