      <p>A South Okanagan driver came clean after a crash that knocked out a power pole, telling police he was drunk.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 19 at 9:10 p.m. a man driving a Ford F250 pickup truck on Highway 97 north of Oliver went off the road and hit a power pole. </p>
      <p>Wires snapped and cut power to the area for around three hours. </p>
      <p>Police arrived on scene and the 52-year-old Osoyoos man immediately admitted he was drunk. </p>
      <p>A roadside alcohol screening test confirmed, and he has now had his vehicle impounded for 30 days and has had his licence suspended for 90 days. </p>
      <p>"The man was fortunate to not have received any serious injuries. It is even more fortunate he did not hurt any innocent bystanders. With all of the education out there on the risks of driving while impaired it is unfathomable we still have some people choosing to do so, putting theirs and others lives at risk," said Sgt Jason Bayda.</p>
      <p>If you see an impaired driver, pull over and call 911 and report as much of the following you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>location</li>
        <li>direction of travel</li>
        <li>vehicle make, model, colour</li>
        <li>offending vehicle licence plate</li>
        <li>description of driver</li>
        <li>why you suspect impairment (vehicle weaving, driving erratic, driver openly consuming alcohol, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
