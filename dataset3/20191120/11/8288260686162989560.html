      <h1>Pizza Express reviews suspended by TripAdvisor after Prince Andrew's 'disastrous' BBC Newsnight interview</h1>
      <h2>Pizza Express found itself at the heart of a surreal Royal alibi thanks to Prince Andrew on Saturday evening</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:10:04+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>TripAdvisor has suspended reviews of a Pizza Express restaurant Prince Andrew claims he visited.</p>
      <p>Pizza Express found itself at the heart of a surreal Royal alibi thanks to Prince Andrew on Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York was interviewed on BBC Newsnight last night about his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein and was asked if he remembered meeting Virginia Giuffre, formerly known as Virginia Roberts, at Tramp Nightclub in London in 2001.</p>
      <p>She's one of 16 women who say they were abused by paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and has previously claimed in court she was forced to have sex with Andrew.</p>
      <p>However, the Prince claimed that he couldn't possibly have had sex with her because he had <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/prince-andrews-surreal-pizza-express-17269612">taken his daughter to Pizza Express in Woking</a> on the alleged date.</p>

      <p>He said: "I was with the children and I'd taken [daughter Princess] Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking for a party at, I suppose, sort of 4pm or 5pm in the afternoon."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>When asked why he would remember a meal at Pizza Express 18 years later, he said: "Because going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do."</p>
      <p>One reviewer wrote: "Love this place. I had a cracking pizza here in 2001. I remember it was 2001 because it was very strange the guy next to me had an American Hot pizza with extra chillies… not a drop of sweat came off him. Very odd."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Both sites have deleted the prank reviews.</p>
      <p>And TripAdvisor says: "Message from TripAdvisor: Due to a recent event that has attracted media attention and has caused an influx of review submissions that do not describe a first-hand experience, we have temporarily suspended publishing new reviews for this listing.</p>
      <p>"If you’ve had a firsthand experience at this property, please check back soon - we’re looking forward to receiving your review!"</p>
