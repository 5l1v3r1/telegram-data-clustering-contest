      <p>Cape Town – Prince Andrew became a patron for the University of Huddersfield and a chancellor at the prestigious institution in 2015 – but in the wake of his ongoing sexual misconduct scandal, students are lobbying for the duke to step down.</p>
      <p>In his <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/watch-prince-andrew-denies-sexual-allegations-in-explosive-interview-20191118"><b>explosive interview</b></a> with BBC News Night on Saturday, he denied claims made by Virginia Roberts that when she was seventeen, she was acquired by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has vehemently denied all allegations levied at him. </p>

          <b>Prince Andrew denies sexual misconduct allegations in explosive interview</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>After the interview that <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/body-language-expert-says-prince-andrew-didnt-appear-to-be-genuine-in-explosive-interview-20191118"><b>critics have deemed "disastrous"</b></a> – "a rotten idea" – students at Huddersfield University have called for the royal to step down.</p>
      <p>Tristan Smith, who launched the campaign, told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/prince-andrew-duke-york-huddersfield-university-chancellor-students-union-a9208101.html"><b>Independent</b></a>, "I don't think this man should be a chancellor and a role model. I want to be proud to go here.</p>
      <p>"A lot of people agree with me, and I had a staff member say to me that they were really pleased that I had put it forward.</p>
      <p>"I don't think his actions represent us. I would be surprised if the SU does not back this. By continuing this relationship and inviting him to our graduations, the university is not making this a safe space."</p>
      <p>The campaign gained steam after the hashtag "#notmychancellor" started trending on Twitter. On Monday evening, the student union met and called for "survivors of sexual assault above royal connections".</p>
      <p>"We as students at the University of Huddersfield and members of Huddersfield Students' Union should not be represented by a man with ties to organised child sexual exploitation and assault," the motion read.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisshipitv"><b>Chris Ship, ITV news royal editor</b></a>, the university is reevaluating their involvement with the duke. "We are aware of the Students' Union meeting last night and the motion it passed regarding the Chancellor," Huddersfield University said. "We listen to our students'students' views and concerns and we will now be consulting with them."</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-19/huddersfield-university-students-vote-for-prince-andrew-to-quit-as-chancellor/"><b>ITV news</b></a>, London Metropolitan University is also reconsidering Prince Andrew's role as its patron while big names such as Standard Chartered and accounting firm KPMG have also cut ties with the royal. </p>
