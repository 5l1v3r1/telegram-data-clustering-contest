      <p>Lowe's Canada has decided to close a number of "underperforming" stores across Canada, including a location in Cambridge.</p>
      <p>The Home &amp; Garden RONA at 66 Pinebush Road is set to close up January 31, 2020, one of 34 stores shutting down so the company can optimize its network.</p>
      <p>"While making decisions that impact our associates and their families is never easy, closing underperforming stores is a necessary step in our plan to ensure the long-term stability and growth of our Canadian business," Tony Cioffi, Interim President of Lowe's Canada states in a release.</p>
      <p>"We are taking decisive action to build a healthy business which will provide us with the flexibility to reinvest in our future growth. This includes having a clear strategy for our banners, built on the strength of our Lowe's, RONA and Reno-Depot brands. It also means investing in our omnichannel and supply chain capabilities, our web platforms, and our existing corporate stores and affiliated dealer network. Our objective continues to be providing our Canadian customers with the right products and the best service and value across every channel, for the long term."</p>
      <p>The release also states employees impacted will be supported through the transition, with eligible employees being offered a chance to transfer to a nearby store.</p>
      <p>Stores impacted include nine in Ontario, 12 in Quebec, six in Alberta, three in British Columbia and Nova Scotia and one in Saskatchewan.</p>
