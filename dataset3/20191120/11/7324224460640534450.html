      <h1>Agnostic Front at Mama Roux's, Birmingham - review</h1>
      <h2>I can remember seeing Agnostic Front play a show in the late-90s and wondering just how long these New York hardcore trailblazers would still be around for.</h2>

      <p>Having formed a the start of the previous decade they had already outlived the majority of their peers, and at the time there was suggestions that their return after a brief sabbatical may be short-lived.</p>
      <p>There was certainly no indication that they would still be tearing it up in 2019.</p>
      <p>But here they are, touring the world on the back of the 35the anniversary of their classic debut album Victim in Pain and a great new record in the Nuclear Blast-released Get Loud!</p>
      <p>The key players are still present and correct, with founding guitarist Vinnie Stigma joined by his brother-in-arms Roger Miret – who has been there pretty much from the start, alongside former Leeway drummer Pokey Mo, long-standing bassist Mike Gallo and ex-Slapshot guitarist Craig Silverman.</p>
      <p>They were welcomed to Mama Roux's – a venue they last played two years ago – by a boisterous crowd who wisely decided to sack off the listless election debate on the TV.</p>
      <p>The band's set plunders a fair few tracks off Victim in Pain, including the title track, Blind Justice and Fascist Attitudes, while the likes of the incendiary Spray Painted Walls and the nostalgia-soaked I Remember, both from the new album, draw a great response from the crowd.</p>
      <p>While Miret is the classic hardcore frontman, dominating the front of the stage with his call-and-response to the crowd, it is hard to take your eyes off Stigma.</p>
      <p>The man belies his advancing years with his frankly ridiculous energy levels. He's part guitarist, part showman, elaborately mopping his brow with a towel between songs and wise-cracking with the crowd.</p>
      <p>He's actually in the crowd for Your Mistake, spinning around with his guitar in the centre of the venue while Miret orchestrates the circle-pit from the stage.</p>
      <p>Agnostic Front play a mixture of the old and the new, with every voice in the place singing along to Old New York from 2015's The American Dream Died and Gotta Go.</p>
      <p>When all is said and done, the band proves once again that they are far more than just a nostalgia kick.</p>
