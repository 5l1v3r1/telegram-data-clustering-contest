      <p>The Blackheath Age UK store was decorated with old photos and posters between November 11 and 14.</p>
      <p>And staff also dressed up in their 1940s finest – including a nurse, land girl and cadet.</p>
      <p>Shop manager Claire Toy said: "We always do a Remembrance Day window display and this year our volunteers decided to make it special. We have printed old photos, dressed in 1940s clothes, played 1940s music.</p>
      <p>"We had a land girl, cadet, nurse and I dressed up in dresses with red lipstick.</p>
      <p>"We have had an amazing week and listened to amazing stories from shoppers of days gone by. People coming in to the shop have been reminiscing.</p>
      <p>"It has been really rewarding for us. We get a lot of old people coming into the shop showing us photos of their family members.</p>
      <p>"We are definitely going to do it again next year – and we are hoping to get more local photos."</p>
