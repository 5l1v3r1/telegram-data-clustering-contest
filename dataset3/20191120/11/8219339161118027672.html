      <h1>Apple launching ‘Apple Music for Business’ to provide music to retail stores</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:27:03+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5mac.com/author/benjaminmayo/" target="_blank">Benjamin Mayo</a></address>
      <p>Apple Music is now partnering with businesses to play music at retail stores. In a partnership with PlayNetwork, businesses can sign up to <a href="https://www.applemusicforbusiness.apple/">Apple Music for Business plans</a> and get licensed music to be played in their retail locations with Apple providing human-curated playlists and even custom recommendations matched to the individual store brand.</p>
      <p>Businesses can control the music being played using a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/music-for-business/id1383340934">special iPhone or iPad app</a>. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-music-gets-into-the-muzak-business-11574247603">notes the program</a> has been piloted for a while and is now expanding to larger stores.</p>
      <p>The consumer licensing terms in mainstream streaming services, like Apple Music or Spotify, do not include provisions for playing music in commercial locations.</p>
      <p>The different terms (such licenses cost more money per stream) mean that businesses need to make deals with special providers to get legal in-store music. Both Spotify and Apple have started divisions of their music services to address the retail audience.</p>
      <p>The Journal says that the Harrods department store started using Apple Music for Business a few weeks ago.</p>
      <p>The deal includes Apple making <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/the-harrods-playlist/pl.a5f9235a104847a9b9a804c69c7f43ae?mt=1&amp;app=music&amp;at=10l3Qe">custom playlists</a> to fit the culture of the store. Harrods will be showing billboards in-store that promote the Apple Music service to customers. Harrods will get an affiliate commission if the signs lead to free trial signups.</p>
