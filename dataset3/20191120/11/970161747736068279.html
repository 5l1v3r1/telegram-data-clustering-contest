      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has declared himself a stan for Shania Twain and honestly, we can’t help but back it.</p>
      <p>The Watermelon Sugar star appears on this week’s Later… with Jools Holland to talk about his new album, and revealing his not-so guilty pleasures in the process.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the pianist, Harry spoke about his broad taste in music and what inspires him to create his own songs.</p>
      <p>Without hesitation, the star confesses: ‘I’m like a massive Shania Twain fan that’s probably my most surprise, but it’s not surprising, she’s amazing.’</p>
      <p>Hey, that actually <i>does </i>impress us much!</p>
      <p>After all, who has created decades worth of bangers over the years? You’re Still The One? Man! I Feel Like a Woman? They’re absolute. Bangers.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the release of his second solo album, Fine Line, Harry also admits that he’s had a lot more fun with the record, after ‘trying too hard’ to be a serious artist on his self-titled debut.</p>

      <p>‘I was bowling with the sides up. I feel like I’ve taken them off now.’</p>
      <p>He added that his new material was about ‘the typical stuff’ telling Jools it was: ‘[About] being sad, and sex and stuff. It’s what everything is about! A few feelings.’</p>
      <p>This week, Harry will be joined on the show by Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, Brittany Howard, FKA Twigs and Abdullah Ibrahi.</p>
      <p>Sir Tom Jones will be co-hosting alongside the star on Friday’s episode.</p>
