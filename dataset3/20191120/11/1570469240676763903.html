      <p>Just hours after Philippine President <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/philippines-president-picks-top-drug-war-critic-as-his-drugs-tsar-260094">Rodrigo Duterte</a> announced he would ban<a href="https://www.wionews.com/business-economy/california-sues-e-cigarette-maker-juul-for-selling-nicotine-products-to-youth-263126"> e-cigarette</a> use, police were ordered on Wednesday to begin arresting people caught vaping in public and to confiscate the devices.</p>
      <p>The abrupt prohibition, revealed by Duterte late Tuesday, adds to a growing global backlash against a product once promoted as less harmful than smoking.</p>
      <p>Duterte called the devices "toxic" and said vaping introduced "chemicals" into the user's body.</p>
      <p>He then threatened to arrest anyone vaping publicly in a country that already has some of Asia's toughest anti-smoking rules.</p>
      <p>The president, a former smoker, is notorious internationally for his deadly anti-narcotics crackdown, but he has also targeted tobacco with a wide-ranging ban on smoking in public.</p>
      <p>Citing "the order of the president", the head of the Philippine police ordered "effective today, all police units nationwide to enforce the ban on the use of vapes; ensure that all violators will be arrested," according to a statement.</p>
      <p>Duterte's order came days after Philippine health authorities reported the nation's first vaping-related lung injury, which resulted in a 16-year-old girl being hospitalised.</p>
      <p>About 24 per cent of Filipinos were tobacco users according to a 2015 <a href="https://www.wionews.com/south-asia/pakistan-deploys-new-vaccine-against-superbug-typhoid-outbreak-262349">World Health Organization </a>study, the most recent available.</p>
      <p>E-cigarettes do not "burn" but instead heat up a liquid, tasting of anything from bourbon to bubble gum, and which usually contains nicotine, that turns into vapour and is inhaled.</p>
