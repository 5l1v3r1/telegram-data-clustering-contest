      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a>’s (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) head is all over the place once more due to the release of sex abuser Maya Stepney (Louisa Clein) in Emmerdale. Upon hearing that she was getting out, Jacob’s feelings for her and her hold over him returned.</p>
      <p>He fled his date with Leanna Cavanagh (Mimi Slinger) and headed out to meet with Maya, pursued by David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden). David stopped Jacob from seeing Maya but it was clear that Jacob wasn’t giving up on his hopes of having a future with Maya.</p>
      <p>He told David that he couldn’t stop him and, upstairs, he made several attemps to contact Maya by text and phone. Maya meanwhile, stepped out of prison and deleted Jacob’s number after a moment of hesitation <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">before holding a clearly pregnant stomach.</a></p>
      <p>Emmerdale aren’t commenting on whether Maya’s baby is David’s or Jacob’s but, despite the twist, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-no-return-planned-for-maya-stepney-amid-pregnancy-twist-11184975/">spokespersons confirmed to Metro.co.uk that there are no current plans for Louisa to return to the role of Maya.</a></p>

      <p>However, the bombshell is there, waiting to explode.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, in an attempt to display a show of normality, Jacob goes on another date with Leanna tonight and assures her he does have feelings for her. Rocked by a clear rejection from Maya, he is determined to make a go of things with Leanna, but is he using her?</p>
      <p>Leanna is nervous as she and Jacob share a heated kiss and, as she unbuttons her blouse, there is a sense that she isn’t completely ready to go through with it. And, as they sleep together, Liam (Jonny McPherson) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/emmerdale-spoilers-dr-liam-cavanagh-attacks-jacob-gallagher-over-shocking-leanna-sex-allegation-10972112/">will hit Jacob with some serious accusations about taking advantage of his daughter.</a></p>
      <p>Is he right to declare that Jacob was forceful in the situation? And what will the consequences be?</p>
