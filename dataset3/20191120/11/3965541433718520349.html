      <h1>King Co. bans employers from paying below minimum wage to people with disabilities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:40:35+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Becca Savransky, SeattlePI</a></address>
      <p>King County officials last week approved an ordinance prohibiting the county and its contractors from paying below minimum wage to employees with disabilities.</p>
      <p>The ordinance — which applies to people the county employs and contractors it does business with — would mandate that employees with disabilities be paid at least minimum wage.</p>
      <p>"Everyone deserves equal opportunity to provide for themselves so they can be financially independent and live an independent life," said Councilmember Dave Upthegrove, who sponsored the legislation.</p>
      <p>"The notion of paying someone less because they have a disability reinforces negative stereotypes and in King County, we value everyone equally and want our policies to reflect."</p>
      <p>Under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employers <a href="https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/subminimumwage">could get certificates to pay</a> subminimum wages “to workers who have disabilities for the work being performed."</p>
      <p>“Disabilities which may affect productive capacity include blindness, mental illness, developmental disabilities, cerebral palsy, alcoholism and drug addiction,”<a href="https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs39.htm"> according</a> to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
      <p>Over the past several years, there has been a national push to end the practice of paying subminimum wages to people with disabilities. Legislation regarding subminimum wage has been discussed and passed in various jurisdictions across the county.</p>
      <p>Last year, Seattle passed legislation that removed the authority for employers in the city to pay people with disabilities subminimum wages.</p>
      <p>Upthegrove said currently, he's not aware of any circumstances of the county or its contractors paying people with disabilities subminimum wages, but one of the biggest values of the King County ordinance is the message it sends and the momentum it creates for future legislation at the state level. The ordinance will also ensure this doesn't happen in the future.</p>
      <p>He emphasized this ordinance was really community-lead, from people with disabilities advocating for an end to this practice.</p>
      <p>Marci Carpenter, the president of the National Federation of the Blind of Washington, said she and others have been working to get more and more employers to say they will not pay people with disabilities below minimum wage, with a goal of getting subminimum wages eliminated for everyone with disabilities.</p>
      <p>Carpenter, along with Shaun Bickley, advocacy specialist at the Arc of King County, helped advocate for and lead the effort for the ordinance in King County, which involved meeting with councilmembers and educating them about the practice of subminimum wage, Carpenter said.</p>
      <p>Bickley, who has been advocating for an end to subminimum wage for years, said part of the idea behind subminimum wage was that employers would be more likely to hire individuals with disabilities if they could pay them less.</p>
      <p>But that's never been true, said Bickley, who is autistic.</p>
      <p>They said many companies have been transitioning away from the practice of subminimum wage over the past several years.</p>
      <p>They added that the subminimum wage is a bad model, and funding should instead be put toward more effective services that can help connect people with disabilities with job coaches and get training and support they need in their work.</p>
      <p>People who have a disability "deserve the same civil and human rights as anyone else," Bickley said.</p>
      <p>Bickley said it's frustrating that people without disabilities want to make decisions for others, without knowing or understanding their experiences.</p>
      <p>"I wish other people would let us make our own decisions about what we need and what's best for us," they said, "instead of instead of trying to determine what is best for us."</p>
      <p>Carpenter said some of the objections she's heard to phasing out subminimum wage have been from parents of disabled children, who are concerned their adult child wouldn't find employment.</p>
      <p>"Now I know that to not be reality," she said.</p>
      <p>She said thousands of disabled workers are working in competitive integrated employment with job coaches to varying degrees. There are a lot of services offered, she said.</p>
      <p>Carpenter said she's known many people who have been paid subminimum wages.</p>
      <p>"And some of them have been told this is all there is for you," she said. "When those people have been asked, would you like to work and make the same wage as everyone else, I've never had a disabled person say no. They say yes, they would."</p>
      <p>She added: "I've especially known a lot of blind people, and blind people with other disabilities...people who just have lived their whole lives with people having such low expectations."</p>
      <p>But, she said, when people get out of that setting and into competitive integrated employment, they're happier, have better social relationships and an improved quality of life.</p>
      <p>"I think there is a lack of awareness and a lot of fear. They're just afraid that their child wont make it, that there wont be enough supports," she said. "I think they don't know how much support is really available."</p>
      <p>Upthegrove said he had a personal connection, too, in his experience seeing his father lose his vision.</p>
      <p>"My dad lost his vision a number of years ago and I've got to experience both the challenges that people face with disabilities," he said, "but also a reminder that having a disability shouldn't mean you are limited or less than others."</p>
      <p>Carpenter said she hopes more employers understand the value that people with disabilities can bring.</p>
      <p>"I'd like more employers to really know and believe that and to trust that disabled workers deserve the same value as able-bodied workers," she said, "and deserve the same dignity and same wage supports as able-bodied workers have."</p>
