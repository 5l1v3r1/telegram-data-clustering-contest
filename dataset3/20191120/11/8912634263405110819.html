      <p>MANILA: Philippine police were ordered Wednesday to arrest anyone caught vaping in public, just hours after Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte announced he would ban e-cigarettes.<br/>The abrupt prohibition, revealed by Duterte late Tuesday adds to a growing global backlash against a product once promoted as less harmful than tobacco smoking.<br/>Duterte, a former smoker, called the devices “toxic” and said vaping introduced “chemicals” into the user’s body.<br/>He ordered the arrest of anyone vaping publicly in a country that already has some of Asia’s toughest anti-smoking rules.<br/>No formal, written order has been made public that spells out the scope of the ban or penalties for violations.<br/>Duterte is notorious internationally for his deadly anti-narcotics crackdown, but he has also targeted tobacco with a wide-ranging ban on smoking in public.<br/>Citing “the order of the president,” on Wednesday a statement from the head of the Philippine police ordered “effective today, all police units nationwide to enforce the ban on use of vapes; ensure that all violators will be arrested.”<br/>The ban came days after Philippine health authorities reported the nation’s first vaping-related lung injury, which resulted in a 16-year-old girl being hospitalized.<br/>Vaping has taken off in the Philippines, with speciality shops and vapers puffing away in public a common sight.<br/>E-cigarette users were caught off guard by the ban and questioned the utility of arresting people who, at worst, were hurting themselves.<br/>“It’s inappropriate. In any case, we don’t hurt people, the environment or animals,” said 22-year-old student Alexis Martin.<br/>“Why are vapers being targeted?”<br/>E-cigarettes warm flavored liquid to produce vapor that is free of the estimated 7,000 chemicals in tobacco smoke, but does contain a number of substances that could potentially be harmful.<br/>Critics say that apart from being harmful in themselves, the multiple exotic flavors of e-cigarette liquids appeal particularly to youngsters and risk getting them addicted to nicotine.<br/>The devices have become hugely popular in the past decade but a rash of vaping-linked deaths and illnesses in the United States is feeding caution about the product, already banned in some places.<br/>In September 2019 India became the latest country to ban the import, sale, production and advertising of e-cigarettes, citing in particular concerns for its youth.<br/>The devices are already banned in several places such as Brazil, Singapore, Thailand and the US state of Massachusetts.</p>
