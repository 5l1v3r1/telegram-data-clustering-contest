      <h1>Intel's Comet Lake-S desktop processor lineup leaks in full</h1>
      <h2>10-core Core i9-10900K will lead the pack</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:40:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/3180/roland-moore-colyer" target="_blank">Roland Moore-Colyer</a></address>
      <p><b>INTEL'S ENTIRE LINE-UP</b> of 10th-generation Comet Lake desktop processors appears to have leaked, revealing CPUs with up to 10 cores and 20 threads.</p>
      <p>The chip chasers at <a href="https://wccftech.com/intel-10th-gen-comet-lake-desktop-cpu-family-400-series-platform-leak/"><i>WCCFTech</i></a> got their peepers on some slides that show what we can expect from the CPU lineup, which will be built upon <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3080684/intel-14nm-comet-lake-cpus-official">another refinement of the 14-nanometre processor architecture</a>; <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3079935/intel-ice-lake-10nm-laptop-chips-revealed">the 10nm node will remain the domain of the Ice Lake mobile CPUs</a> for the time being.</p>
      <p>Comet Lake-S is the codename given to the mainstream 10th-gen desktop CPUs, which will be lead by <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3072713/intels-comet-lake-s-processors-set-to-feature-up-to-10-cores">the 10-core, 20-thread Core i9-10900K</a>. Other than the fact it'll come with 20MB of cache, there's precious little other information on offer.</p>
      <p>But there are more details on the Core i9-10900, which sports the same number of cores and threads but has a base clock speed of 3GHz that ramps up to 5.1GHz by extracting performance from an 80W thermal design power.</p>
      <p>The Core i9 lineup not only includes a 'K' version and a non-suffixed CPU, but also a 'T' chip, which has a reduced TDP of 35W and thus has a lower base clock speed and boost speed. It's the same story for other Core chips in the Comet Lake-S range.</p>
      <p>Skip down to the Core i7 chips and you're looking at eight-core and 16-thread CPUs. The Core i7-10700 is expected to run from 3GHz to 4.8GHz, sports 16MB of cache and a 65W TDP.</p>
      <p>10th-gen Core i5 processors have six cores and 12 threads, and the Core i5-10500 has a base clock speed of 3.2GHz that spools up to 4.3Ghz; 12MB of cache and a 65W TDP complete the specs. We reckon such a chip will appeal to folks after a mainstream desktop that has a solid processor for getting s**t done and playing games.</p>
      <p>Step down to the Core i3, and if you were expecting CPUs with four cores and eight threads, then you'd be right. The Core i3-10100 clocks from 3.2GHz to 3.8GHz, with 12MB of cache and a 65W TDP.</p>
      <p>Starting from the Core i3 and going up the range, the tenth-gen CPUs sport Hyperthreading, come with WIFi 6 support, and can support up to 40 PCIe 3.0 lanes.</p>
      <p>According to the slides, Comet Lake-S offers an 18 per cent performance hike in multi-threaded compute tasks over the previous Coffee Lake-R CPUs, and delivers an eight per cent boost in Windows application performance.</p>
      <p>Going by this leaked info, it looks like the Comet Lake-S CPUs will offer a step-up from the previous generation of Core desktop processors. But as the 14nm process node is still being used, we don't expect that boost to be hugely significant.</p>
      <p>We suspect one will have to wait for 10nm desktop processors to see a major step-change from Intel in the desktop CPU arena; <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3082672/intel-abandon-10nm-desktop-cpus-rumour">apparently it's beavering away on such chips</a>. µ</p>
