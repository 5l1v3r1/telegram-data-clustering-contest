      <p>Concerns have been raised after a potentially deadly tick-borne parasite was found in the UK for the first time.</p>
      <p>The organism – named B. venatorum – causes babesiosis, an animal disease recognised as an emerging infection in people.</p>
      <p>It has been recorded extensively in China and also in Europe, with two confirmed human infections in Italy over the last two decades, but has never previously appeared in the UK.</p>
      <aside>These findings signify a change in the landscape of tick-borne pathogens in the UK<cite>Willie Weir</cite></aside>
      <p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said infected people may get symptoms such as flu and jaundice but severe cases can lead to death.</p>
      <p>A study by University of Glasgow scientists reports the organism has now been identified in sheep in the north-east of Scotland.</p>
      <p>Willie Weir, senior university clinician, said: “The presence of B. venatorum in the UK represents a new risk to humans working, living, or hiking in areas with infected ticks and livestock, particularly sheep.</p>
      <p>“Although we believe the threat to humans to be low, nevertheless local health and veterinary professionals will need to be aware of the disease if the health risk from tick-borne disease in the UK is to be fully understood.</p>
      <p>“Our findings follow the recent report of the detection of tick-borne encephalitis virus in the UK.</p>
      <p>“Taken together, these findings signify a change in the landscape of tick-borne pathogens in the UK and the underlying causes for this need to be investigated.”</p>
      <p>Scientists collected blood from sheep, cattle and deer in the north-east of Scotland in areas where tick-borne diseases have previously been detected.</p>
      <p>DNA from the parasite was detected in the blood of a large number of sheep, which were not showing any signs of disease, making them carrier animals.</p>
      <p>Researchers believe B. venatorum may have been carried to the UK by migratory birds from Scandinavia.</p>
      <p>Identification of this parasite in the UK raises concerns for European public health and farming policy, according to the study’s authors.</p>
      <p>The paper is published in the December edition of Emerging Infectious Disease.</p>
