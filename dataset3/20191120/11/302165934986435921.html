      <p>SINGAPORE, Nov 20 — Asia’s food and agriculture industry needs investment of US$800 billion (RM3.3 trillion) over the next 10 years to meet the region’s growing food demand, a jointly produced report showed today.</p>
      <p>Investments will unlock annual market growth of around seven per cent, with the region more than doubling its spending on food to more than US$8 trillion by 2030, according to the report by consultancy PwC, Rabobank and Singapore state investor Temasek.</p>
      <p>Asia’s growing population and rising incomes are resulting in higher demand for protein-rich foods which require investment in setting of food supply chains.</p>
      <p>The report, titled The Asia Food Challenge, sees several Asian cities, such as Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Singapore and Tokyo, having the potential to become agriculture-food tech hubs.</p>
      <p>The report said the Singapore Food Agency has set a goal to produce 30 per cent of the country’s nutritional needs by 2030 by adopting new solutions and technologies to grow more with less. — Reuters</p>
