      <p>Shenmue 3 is finally out but series creator Yu Suzuki is already talking about making a fourth game, as he writes to thank fans for their backing.</p>
      <p>As impossible as it may seem, Shenmue 3 not only exists but is out now and already being played by fans (there are no reviews yet because copies weren’t sent out to press early enough).</p>
      <p>But what many may not realise is that Shenmue 3 does not end the story started on the Dreamcast two decades ago. To do that would need more games, which creator Yu Suzuki has written to fans to say he now wants to make.</p>
      <p>You can read the entire letter below, but in it Suzuki says, ‘I sincerely hope that, together, we can continue to spin the tale of Ryo and his adventures in Shenmue 4’.</p>

      <p>According to the original plan for the story, Shenmue 3 only gets about halfway and Suzuki has previously talked about needing to get to at least Shenmue 5 to tie things up properly.</p>

      <p>Much of Shenmue 3’s budget came from crowdfunding, so there’s a good chance he’ll go that route again for Shenmue 4. Although his job will be made easier or harder depending on how well the game sells with non-backers.</p>
      <p>Shenmue 3 did have plenty of financial support from outside companies but if it doesn’t sell that well, they may be difficult to get back on board for a new game.</p>
      <h3>Yu Suzuki thank you letter to fans</h3>
      <p>To all the fans who have waited many years for Shenmue 3, and to all of the crowdfunding backers who have made this game possible: This project would not exist without your love, support, and the connections we’ve made along the way. With profound appreciation for all that you have done, I am happy to finally present to you Shenmue 3.</p>
      <p>During development I expanded the scope beyond what I had originally envisioned. I’m happy we were able to include the distinct ‘Shenmue’ charm throughout the game. I hope that this new chapter strikes even a small resonance in your heart.</p>
      <p>For as long as there are those who wish to see Shenmue live on, I will never give up on my own personal journey to complete its story. As with Shenmue 3, the Shenmue story is with you.</p>
      <p>I sincerely hope that, together, we can continue to spin the tale of Ryo and his adventures in Shenmue 4.</p>
      <p>This goes out to all who have ever loved and supported Shenmue.</p>
      <p>Yu Suzuki</p>
