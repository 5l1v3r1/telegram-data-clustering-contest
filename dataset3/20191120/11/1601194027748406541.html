      <h4>What's the story?</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/saif-hassan">Saif Hassan,</a> the Bangladesh opener, will not be able to take part in the historic day-night Test match against India after he split his finger webbing during the first Test of the series. Bangladesh Cricket Board revealed his injury status via a press release thereby confirming that he is ruled out of the second Test.</p>
      <h4>The background</h4>
      <p>The 21-year-old opening batsman Saif had made a name for himself in the Bangladeshi domestic circuit. He had even captained the U-23 side of Bangladesh before the selectors named him in the squad for the series against India.</p>
      <p>He had made his first-class debut in 2015 and till date, he had played 37 FC matches, aggregating 2,245 runs at an average of 45.81. The youngster had hit four centuries and 11 fifties in his brief first-class career whereas his highest score was 220*.</p>
      <h4>The heart of the matter</h4>
      <p>The Dhaka-born right-handed batsman had injured his finger while fielding as the 12th Man for Bangladesh in the Indore Test. Since he has not recovered to full fitness, the Bangladesh Cricket Board issued the following <a href="https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/110891/saif-hassan-ruled-out-of-kolkata-test-with-split-webbing">statement</a> in a press release -</p>
      <blockquote>"Medical Team is of the opinion that he will benefit from being rested to full recovery. Taking the state of injury into consideration, Saif has been ruled out of the second Test."</blockquote>
      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>Hassan was in line to make his Test debut as the team's primary openers, Shadnam Islam and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/imrul-kayes">Imrul Kayes</a> had been ineffective against the Indian pace bowling attack. With the Test match set to begin soon, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/bangladesh">Bangladesh Cricket Board</a> has named no replacement for the injured batsman so, Kayes and Islam will get one more opportunity to prove themselves at Eden Gardens.</p>
