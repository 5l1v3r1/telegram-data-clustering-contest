      <h1>Sophie joining Alden: ‘Very positive, encouraging’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:04:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/mario-bautista" target="_blank">Mario Bautista</a></address>
      <h3>SOPHIE Albert  has joined the cast of ‘The Gift’ and the feedback she’s getting for her presence on the show is very positive and encouraging.</h3>
      <p>“I play Helga, isang psychic,” says Sophie. “I’m happy to have a new show after matapos 'yung afternoon soap naming ‘Bihag’ na contravida ang role ko. This time, mabait naman ako as a psychic. I see dead people, mga kaluluwang hindi matahimik at gumagala and I try to help them, like Alden’s dad in the story, TJ Trinidad.”</p>
      <p>When lead actor Alden Richards’ character as Sep was kidnapped by bad elements masterminded by his own half-brother, Martin del Rosario as Jared, Sophie teams up with the spirit of Alden’s dad, TJ Trinidad as Gener, who died in the first week of telecast of “The Gift”. Gener now returns to help his son whenever he is in danger.</p>
      <p>“Nagtulong kami ng father ni Alden to find out kung saan siya dinala ng mga kidnaper at ayun, we were able to help him,” adds Sophie. “We succeeded in informing his adoptive mom, si Jo Berry, and his lola, Elizabeth Oropesa, about his whereabouts kaya natagpuan siya at nadala sa ospital matapos siyang bugbugin ng mga kumidnap sa kanya.”</p>
      <p>It’s Sophie as Helga who explains to Alden that the father he is looking for is already dead. She also revealed to him that Jo Berry as Strawberry and Beth O as Lola Char already know that his dad, who he sees only in his dreams, has long been gone. But naturally, Alden felt bad that his adoptive mom and grandma concealed the truth from him. They apologize to him but he finds it difficult to forgive them as he feels like they betrayed him.</p>
      <p>But what Alden doesn’t know is that they also know that his real mom is Jean Garcia as Nadia and they’re also hiding this from him. Comedian Tetay as Tonia has already found out the truth about this but he is threatened by Christian Vasquez and Rochelle Pangilinan not to reveal it to Jean herself as this would no doubt make Jean shower all her attention to her long lost son. No doubt that this would also make Martin del Rosario more cruel and abusive to Alden.</p>
      <p>Is Sophie enjoying playing her role as Helga? “Oo naman. Kasi first time ko lang gumanap ng isang psychic and I didn’t expect na eventually, magiging magka-team up kami ni Alden. Pareho kaming may gift dito. Ako, I can talk to dead people at siya naman, he’s clairvoyant who can look into the past and the future. So ayun, naging magkatulong kami ngayon sa pagtulong sa ibang taong may kinakaharap na problema.”</p>
      <p>“The Gift” continues to enjoy positive feedback from its loyal viewers and from advertisers who continue to fill it up with their full commercial load.  But will Sophie be the new ka-love team of Alden as Sep, now that Thia Thomalia, his original crush as Faith, has already been killed? What happens now to his good friend, Mikee Quintos as Amor, who continues to harbor secret feelings for him? Don’t miss each exciting episode of “The Gift” now that the situations in the life of Alden are getting more and more intriguing.</p>
