        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/haas-f1">Haas</a> team principal Guenther Steiner believes <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/romain-grosjean">Romain Grosjean</a> could've had a shot at the podium at the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/brazilian-grand-prix">Brazilian Grand Prix</a> if it wasn't for an "unbelievable" MGU-K glitch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grosjean looked set to be in the points at Interlagos, but a collision with<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz"> Carlos Sainz</a> at the restart pushed the French driver wide and he couldn't recover from the incident and finished outside of the points.</p>
      <p><i>"He couldn't get going," </i>Steiner said to <i>Motorsport.com </i>on Grosjean. <i>"And then Sainz pushed him off as well you know. Then you just go back into the mix again. Our car in the traffic isn't good, so we just lost all these positions, and then it was like, you say, like square one.</i></p>

        <i>"It was only on that restart that there an MGU-K failure. It's unbelievable to me, you know."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good news for Haas, though, with Steiner confirming the glitch to the MGU-K is a temporary thing rather than a long-term issue to pile on top of their big pile of problems they already have.</p>
      <p><i>"It was kicking out," </i>Steiner added. <i>"He had no power from the MGU-K, and then the next acceleration was cutting out and then it was good again. Nobody knows what it is. We still don't know because afterwards it worked again."</i></p>
