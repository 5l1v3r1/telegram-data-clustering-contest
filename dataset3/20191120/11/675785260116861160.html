      <h1>Couple accused of 'promoting rape' with Handmaid's Tale-themed pregnancy announcement</h1>
      <h2>Leah Hampton and her husband Marquis, of Orlando, shared the baby news by posting a series of photos but were shocked by the accusations of a "rape baby"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:57:15+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:57</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Kim Reader, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A couple has been accused of 'promoting rape' after announcing their pregnancy by mocking up a 'creepy' Handmaid's Tale-themed photo shoot.</p>
      <p>Mum-to-be Leah Hampton and her husband Marquis Wimberly shared the baby news by posting a series of photos - only to be met with a barrage of 'hateful comments'.</p>
      <p>Handmaid's Tale is a dystopian novel by Maragret Atwood in which fertile women, called handmaids, are treated as property of the state and forced into sexual servitude to repopulate a devastated world.</p>
      <p>It has been made into a TV drama, which first aired in April 2017.</p>
      <p>As fans on the show, Leah and Marquis, of Orlando, Florida, USA, decided to use the controversial subject as their theme to announce Leah's pregnancy.</p>

      <p>Social worker Leah, 28, dressed in the red robes and white bonnet iconic of the handmaids' uniforms while marketing manager Marquis, 27, wore a suit to look like one of the 'male masters'.</p>
      <p>In one of the images, Marquis does up his tie while Leah lies on the bed behind him, leaving commenters claiming they appear to be re-enacting a rape scene from the show.</p>
      <p>In another Marquis stares at Leah across a kitchen counter while she looks downwards, as if upset by something.</p>
      <p>After sharing the photos on Leah's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> profile on Tuesday, October 29, the post quickly went viral racking up 4,500 shares and 15,000 comments - many of which branded them 'repugnant'.</p>
      <p>Some furious commenters slated the couple of 'glorifying' the rape and enslavement of women while others sarcastically congratulated them on the birth of their 'rape baby'.</p>
      <p>While the former foster parents expected that their choice of theme might divide opinions, they were not prepared for the level of backlash - but say they remain 'unmoved' by their haters.</p>
      <p>Marquis said: "We were not expecting the negativity that came from it - not even a little bit.</p>

      <p>"Not just the negativity, we didn't expect any sort of reaction outside of our friends and family. We thought maybe some friends of friends might see it but not total strangers.</p>
      <p>"It would be unreasonable of us to expect everyone to be in love with what we did. We knew there would be some mixed reactions but not to the level it has been.</p>
      <p>"I think people felt like they could shame us into removing them or into apologising.</p>
      <p>"But we were not going to take the post down or issue some sort of apology. That's what we mean when we say we are unmoved.</p>
      <p>"I'm comfortable with what we put out there and what we did. I'm okay if some people don't like it. I'm just not okay with people saying crazy things.</p>
      <p>"Me and Leah have been foster parents in the past. I feel like we have done enough in our lives to trust our judgement.</p>
      <p>"Not that we can't get things wrong but I can't take people seriously who call into question our parenting off of a photo shoot.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>"People were saying they don't get what kind of parents we're going to be and then in the next breath asking Leah 'do you need help? This is the number for a survivors' hotline'.</p>
      <p>"It's disingenuous. It makes me question whether people are actually worried or they just want us to feel ashamed.</p>
      <p>"The most disturbing to me was that people made this sort of connection like our photo shoot was there to portray the manner in which our child was conceived.</p>
      <p>"It never occurred to me that people would go that far and read into it in that way.</p>
      <p>"Of all the pregnancy shoots I have seen, I have never known any to offer some insight into how the couple conceived their child.</p>
      <p>"If we had dressed up as Bonnie and Clyde, who are real life murderers, would people assume that our child was conceived on the run and we bought our crib with bank robbery money?"</p>
      <p>However many angry commenters failed to see how the usage of the Handmaid's Tale imagery in a pregnancy shoot could mean anything other than 'promoting rape'.</p>

      <p>Melissa Rose said: "Do they not realise they're literally promoting rape by doing this photo shoot?"</p>
      <p>Stacy Urbano-modra added: "Congrats on your rape baby. Maybe for the next picture mom can hold you down while he crawls on top of you.</p>
      <p>"Nothing says "I'm excited about my baby" like rape references. Dumb c**t <i>."</i></p>
