      <p>The Fortnite v11.20 patch is now available across all platforms, bringing with it new Daily Challenges and some new information about Chapter 2: Season 1.</p>
      <p>Alongside the new patch, it was announced that Fortnite Chapter 2: Season 1 will run until February 2020. There will be a festive update as we near December, but this Season will carry on beyond the new year. In previous seasons, there were 14 days of Overtime Challenges, whereas Season 1 is set to be considerably longer.</p>
      <p>The <b>Bandage Bazooka </b>finally makes a comeback this week after a previously poor performance. The <b>Snowman set </b>has also been added and you can create some wintery scenes for the #FrostyFortnite competition. You can<a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/frosty-fortnite"> submit your winter wonderland creations here.</a></p>
      <p><b>Daily Challenges </b>have been added into the mix and there will be three available at a time. You’ll also be able to replace one challenge for another once per day.</p>
      <p>There have been various other fixes to the Magma Wrap, inventory selections and damage scaling, which you can check out below.</p>
