      <p>Rule changes on three streets in Hollinswood have been proposed by Telford &amp; Wrekin Council, aimed at reducing congestion there.</p>
      <p>Hollinswood and Randlay Parish Council agreed to support the draft proposals, and initial consultation surveys will be sent to residents on Dallamoor, Deercote and Whitworth Drive.</p>
      <p>A traffic regulation order could eventually be brought in to enforce the changes.</p>
      <p>Parish clerk Katrina Baker said that in addition to the ambulance, refuse collections have also been obstructed on Dallamoor, and a lot of visitors to Telford dodge the area’s parking charges by parking on Deercote and walking less than half a mile to the shopping centre.</p>
      <p>Dallamoor currently has double yellow lines – indicating no waiting at any time – near its junction with Dale Acre Way.</p>
      <p>The draft plans would see those extended further into the multi-branch close, including around the east border of the play area.</p>
      <h3>Issues</h3>
      <p>Double-yellow lines are proposed on Deercote around the Dalford Court, Delbury Court and Downton Court junctions, and Whitworth Drive would see double-yellow lines around its junctions with Fairburn Road and Randlay Avenue.</p>
      <p>A part-time no-waiting zone would also be introduced around the Brunlees Drive entrance, if the plans are approved in their current form.</p>
      <p>Ms Baker told parish councillors: “Over the last four or five months we have had lots of issues on our estates, particularly on Dallamoor, Deercote and Whitworth Drive.</p>
      <p>“We had quite a nasty incident on Dallamoor where an ambulance couldn’t get through to help a resident.”</p>
      <h3>Parking charges</h3>
      <p>She said drivers were parking on both sides of the street, narrowing the available carriageway.</p>
      <p>“Even the binmen haven’t been able to collect the bins on some occasions,” she said.</p>
      <p>Regarding Deercote, Ms Baker said: “Our issue there is people visiting the town centre and using that shortcut just because they don’t want to pay the parking charges there.</p>
      <p>“The plan here is to restrict parking around the junctions. Parking will still be allowed on other sections of the street because it slows cars down.”</p>
      <p>Hollinswood and Randlay parish councillors approved the draft plans and agreed to deliver consultation letters, produced by Telford &amp; Wrekin Council, to the affected streets. A second, legally-required formal consultation would take place before the imposition of a traffic regulation order.</p>
      <p>Ms Baker added that borough council officers are working to identify problem areas around the borough, in order to direct the newly-recruited civil parking enforcement officers, who are due to receive full fine-issuing powers on January 31 next year.</p>
      <p>Chairman Sheenagh Unwin encouraged councillors and the public to report inconsiderate and illegal parking “as much as we can”.</p>
