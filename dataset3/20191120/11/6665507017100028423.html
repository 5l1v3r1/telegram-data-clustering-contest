      <p>The Congress demanded on Wednesday that the government must disclose all details about <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/electoral-bonds/">electoral bonds</a> before Parliament following <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/news/paisapolitics/">HuffPost India’s investigation into the scheme</a>.</p>
      <p>Reports by journalist Nitin Sethi, published this week, reveal how the government dismissed the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/rbi-warned-electoral-bonds-arun-jaitley-black-money-modi-government_in_5dcbde68e4b0d43931ccd200?utm_hp_ref=in-homepage">RBI</a> and the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/electoral-bonds-narendra-modi-election-commission-opposition-arun-jaitley_in_5dce3cd1e4b01f982eff5c62">Election Commission</a>’s objections to the scheme. Months later, the <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/electoral-bonds-modi-illegal-sale-state-elections_in_5dce6b7ee4b01f982effa205">PMO told the finance ministry</a> to break its own rules to allow for illegal sale of electoral bonds before crucial state elections. </p>
      <p>At a press conference on Wednesday, Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said that the scheme resulted in money laundering and destroyed transparency in the funding of political parties. </p>
      <p>“What we are talking about today leads straight to the PM’s office. The BJP govt is running 90 per cent of the business in this country with a few industrialists,” senior Azad said, <i>PTI</i> quoted.</p>

      <p>He called electoral bonds a “political bribery scheme” and said it was a scam that tarnished the image of the Indian democracy.</p>
      <p>Azad, along with party colleagues Randeep Singh Surjewala and Anand Sharma, said under the electoral bonds scheme, the donor buying the bonds could hide his identity and at the same time, a political party needed to share the details as regards from whom it got how much money.</p>
      <p>“Our demand is that the PM must intervene and the government must disclose full donor information, who donated crores to the BJP coffers, and place this information before Parliament,” Sharma said.</p>
      <p>“Parliament is in session and the government should make the disclosure before both the houses,” he added.</p>
