      <p>The Senate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/19/senate-passes-bill-in-support-of-hong-kong-pro-democracy-protesters-071787">unanimously passed legislation</a> Tuesday aimed at supporting the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong as they <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia-pacific/hong-kong-protesters-police-enter-final-phase-of-showdown-as-china-slams-us/2019/11/19/6b571fb2-0b10-11ea-8054-289aef6e38a3_story.html">brace for a pivotal showdown</a> with security forces. The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act would require the State Department to certify Hong Kong's sufficient autonomy from China once a year, and threatens sanctions and withdrawal of Hong Kong's special trade status if it comes up short. The House passed similar legislation in October, and once the two bills are reconciled, they would head to President Trump's desk.

      <p>"Passing this legislation is an important step forward in holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and its repression of fundamental freedoms," Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch (R-Idaho) said. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) added that "as the situation in Hong Kong deteriorates, China must understand that the United States of America is committed to the promised freedom and autonomy for Hong Kong."</p>
      <p>China did not see it that way. Beijing <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3038516/china-will-retaliate-if-donald-trump-signs-hong-kong-human">summoned a senior U.S. diplomat on Wednesday</a> to emphasize its opposition to the bill, warning Trump that if he signs the bill, "China will take strong opposing measures, and the U.S. has to bear all the consequences." In a separate statement, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang warned the Trump administration to "take steps to stop the act from becoming a law, and stop meddling in the internal affairs of China and Hong Kong, to avoid setting a fire that would only burn itself."</p>
