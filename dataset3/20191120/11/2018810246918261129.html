      <p>Back in March, <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/03/when-anoverwatch-voice-actor-cosplays-as-her-character">we ran a little feature on Carolina Ravassa, the voice actor behind Sombra who spent a day cosplaying as the <i>Overwatch</i> hacker</a>. That was at Katsucon, but for BlizzCon 2019, she was joined by two other cast members, Anjali Bhimani (Symmetra) and Matthew Mercer (McCree).</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mjasmine.design/">Cosplayer Melanie Jasmine</a> (below, left) made Ravassa and Bhimani’s outfits, while the incredible <a href="https://www.instagram.com/keltonfx/?hl=en">Kelton FX</a>—<a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/11/overwatch-cosplay-from-another-universe">whose own <i>Overwatch</i> work we featured earlier in the year</a>—handled their prosthetics and make-up.</p>
      <p>As for that <i>other</i> guy not in costume, that’s Zenyatta’s voice actor Feodor Chin, just hangin’ out with some friends, maybe not feeling like spending the whole weekend wearing armour and floating around everywhere.</p>
