      <h3>What to look for when buying a gaming chair</h3>
      <p>When you’re on the market for a gaming chair, there are several factors you should consider as, unlike most standard chairs, gaming chairs aren’t always one-size-fits-all.</p>
      <p>The first, and most important, is ergonomics. Basic gaming chairs only have height adjustment, but it’s well worth looking for a chair that features a reclining back and adjustable armrests too. Take the chair’s backrest height into consideration, and measure yourself if possible too.</p>
      <p>After all, it’s important that your chair properly supports your spine and offers enough adjustment to fit your body, rather than the other way around.</p>
      <p>Longevity is another factor to consider, and this is where gaming chairs can get expensive.</p>
      <p>Entry-level gaming chairs often feature cheap foam that’ll lose its shape and becomes less supportive over time. High-quality foam should retain structure and provide support for years, while also having the benefit of supporting heavier users. The material should also be considered; most feature PU leather, but some feature real leather that should last a lot longer.</p>
      <p>And, of course, the length of the warranty should be considered; after all, there are plenty of moving parts in a gaming chair and there’s always a possibility that something will go wrong.

      <h3>Where to find gaming chair deals</h3>
      <p>You’ll find gaming chair deals from a number of PC-themed retailers in the UK including <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3778198-11-0000000&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2F">Currys PC World</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778198-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fgame%2Fbest-gaming-chair-deals-3778198%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.overclockers.co.uk%2F">Overclockers UK</a>, and it’s also worth going directly to gaming chair manufacturer’s websites for attractive deals – especially in the run-up to <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday 2019</a> later this month.</p>
