        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> has been backed to take over at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bayern-munich-fc/">Bayern Munich</a> having been sacked as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> manager on Tuesday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 47-year-old was dismissed by Spurs after a poor run of form which sees them sitting 14th in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> with just three wins from their opening 12 matches.</p>
      <p>However, he will not be short of options at big clubs after leaving north London, with a number of European giants expected to be interested in his signature.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich have emerged as the early favourites seen as they do not have a permanent manager in charge at the moment.</p>
      <p>Hans-Dieter Flick is the interim boss at the Allianz Arena and has won both of his games in charge, leading to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/arsene-wenger-admits-approached-bayern-munich-job-not-candidate-11076225/">club stating he will remain ‘until further notice.’</a></p>
      <p>However, with Pochettino now available, they may see the Argentinian as a better long-term option and punters seem to agree.</p>

      <p>A Betfair spokesperson said: ‘Since the announcement of Pochettino and Spurs going their separate ways, all the money has been on Bayern Munich to be the Argentine’s next clubs. We have slashed the odds from 5/1 to 6/4 overnight.’</p>
      <h3>Odds on Mauricio Pochettino's next permanent club</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>6/4 Bayern Munich</li>
        <li>7/2 Man Utd</li>
        <li>7/2 Real Madrid</li>
        <li>7/1 PSG</li>
        <li>14/1 Juventus</li>
        <li>14/1 Arsenal</li>
        <li>20/1 Man City</li>
        <li>20/1 Argentina National Team</li>
        <li>25/1 AC Milan</li>
        <li>33/1 Barcelona</li>
        <li>33/1 Napoli</li>
        <li>50/1 Borussia Dortmund</li>
        <li>50/1 Atletico Madrid</li>
        <li>66/1 Liverpool</li>
        <li>66/1 Chelsea</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Odds courtesy of Betfair</p>
      <p>Bayern are now the clear favourites to snap up Pochettino, but Manchester United and Real Madrid are also considered as realistic destinations for him.</p>
      <p>Both the Red Devils and Los Blancos are priced at 7/2 as joint second-favourites as Pochettino’s next club, but clearly there would need to be some more dramatic action for him to go to Old Trafford or the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains in charge of United while Zinedine Zidane is managing his first full season with Real since returning to the club in March.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are looking quite unconvincing in seventh in the Premier League, while Real Madrid are level on points with Barcelona at the top of La Liga. Neither Solskjaer nor Zidane look likely to be sacked in the imminent future.</p>
      <p>Less likely contenders to snap up Pochettino are Paris Saint-Germain (7/1), Juventus (14/1) and Arsenal (14/1).</p>
