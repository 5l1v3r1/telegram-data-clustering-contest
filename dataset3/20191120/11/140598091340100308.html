      <p>I love white currents poached in a touch of elderflower just spooned over the pannacotta. You can make this dessert in advance of a dinner party so that you have less to worry about on the day. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes, plus setting time (ideally overnight) | <b>Cooking time: </b>10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four to six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>150ml double cream</li>
        <li>½ vanilla pod, split in half and seeds scraped</li>
        <li>50ml condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 gelatine leaf, soaked in ice cold water to soften</li>
        <li>175ml buttermilk</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the double cream, vanilla pod and seeds in a saucepan and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li>Stir in the condensed milk and remove from the heat. Squeeze the soaked gelatine leaf in your hand to get rid of excess of water and add this to the pan, stirring to dissolve.</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to cool and finally add the buttermilk.</li>
        <li>Remove the vanilla pod. Pour the mixture into four to six (depending on the size) panna cotta or small pudding moulds and leave to set in the fridge, ideally overnight.</li>
        <li>Serve the pannacotta turned out, with poached fruits or cantucci biscuits.</li>
