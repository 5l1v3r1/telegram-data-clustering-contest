      <p><b>LA PAZ -</b> Three protesters were killed and 30 wounded in clashes Tuesday with Bolivian security forces lifting an opposition blockade of fuel supplies to La Paz, the public ombudsman's office reported.<br/><br/>Troops and police had moved to lift the siege on a fuel plant in El Alto by supporters of ex-president Evo Morales that has caused acute shortages in nearby La Paz.<br/><br/>A spokesman for the ombudsman's office said two of the dead had been hit by gunfire, including a 31-year old man.<br/><br/>"We are asking the authorities for an investigation," the spokesman told AFP, adding that 30 people had been wounded, all of them supporters of Morales.<br/><br/>The army said in a statement that "agitators and vandals" had attacked and partially destroyed the Senkata fuel plant in El Alto, "using high-powered explosives."<br/><br/>The deaths brings to 27 the number of people killed since unrest began in the wake of October 20 elections, according to a tally by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.<br/><br/>A convoy of around 50 fuel tankers was able to leave the Senkata plant for the first time in more than a week after police and military forces using armored vehicles secured the route to neighboring La Paz.<br/><br/>The convoy included gasoline, diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tankers.<br/><br/>Morales supporters erected barricades around the El Alto plant last week to protest what they said was a coup by interim President Jeanine Anez.<br/><br/>The blockade caused serious fuel shortages in La Paz, the scene of daily protests against the new government. Public transport has largely been paralyzed by the shortages.<br/><br/>Morales condemned the deaths in a tweet from Mexico, which granted him political asylum after his November 10 resignation. -AFP</p>
