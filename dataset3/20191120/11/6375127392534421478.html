      <h1>Magnificent Eagles complete 16-0 sweep</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:54:37+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/theodore-p-jurado" target="_blank">Theodore P. Jurado</a></address>
      <h3>COUNT this Ateneo team as one of the greatest in UAAP’s basketball history.</h3>
      <p>Displaying tremendous team play right from the get-go, the Blue Eagles completed a  magnificent 16-0 season with an 86-79 tripping of University of Santo Tomas last night before 20,198 fans at the Mall of Asia Arena.</p>
      <p>As what coach Tab Baldwin was expecting after Game 1, the Growling Tigers put up a gallant stand after trailing behind in the early goings, but the disciplined Katipunan dribblers won’t be denied in fulfilling a three-peat and 11th championship overall.</p>
      <p>Aside from ending this decade as the most successful program, Ateneo also became the fourth school to annex a championship without dropping a single game, joining the ranks of University of the East (1969 and 1970), Far Eastern University (1976, 1980 and 1981), and UST (1993).</p>
      <p>Thriving in games when mattered, Thirdy Ravena had a scintillating outing of 17 points, seven rebounds and five assists in his swan song for the Eagles while SJ Belangel scattered all of his 15 points from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p>Ravena was later named the Finals MVP for the third consecutive season after averaging 24.5 points, six rebounds and four assists in the series.</p>
      <p>“Hinding-hindi kami magpapatalo. Gagawa kami ng history,” said Matt Nieto, who had 14 points, six boards and five assists in his final appearance in blue and white.      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, National University, rallying on injured forward Jack Danielle Animam, went through the wringer before beating UST, 70-65, to move closer to claiming its sixth straight women’s championship.</p>
      <p>Congo’s Rhena Itesi had a double-double outing of 17 points and 13 rebounds while Fil-Am Kelly Hayes chipped in 16 points as the Lady Bulldogs weathered a late Tigresses rally to extend their unbeaten run to 95 games.</p>
      <p>Despite being swept in the Finals, it was still an incredible season for upstart UST, which made it back as one of the league’s elite teams after toppling FEU and University of the Philippines twice in the step-ladder semifinals.      </p>
      <p>Using their tough defense, the Eagles were in control in the first period, 31-18, before tapering off in the second quarter as the Tigers were able to close to within 32-37.</p>
      <p>Ateneo brought back the lead to double-digits at the break, 42-32, after Ravena completed a three-point play.</p>
      <p>UST threatened at 66-67 on a CJ Cansino lay-up before Belangel, Ravena and Ivorian Ange Kouame took over in the final seven minutes.  </p>
      <p>Rhenz Abando had 16 points, Rookie of the Year winner Mark Nonoy chipped in 14 points, six rebounds and five assists while newly-minted MVP Soulemane Chabi Yo had a double-double of 11 points and 19 rebounds for the Tigers.</p>
      <p>Animam, who averaged 15 points and 12.4 boards this season, missed the game due to a fractured orbital bone in her right eye she suffered during the Philippines’ campaign in the recently-concluded Fiba Asia Olympic qualifiers in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for NU, it took a collective effort to fill the huge void left by Animam, who is on her final season with the Bustillos-based squad.</p>
      <p>“I’m just happy. What can I say? I’m sad that Jack was not here with us, but happy that everyone stepped up,” said Lady Bulldogs coach Pat Aquino.</p>
      <p>Kaye Pingol added 12 points, including a key triple in the final 1:31 that gave NU a 70-65 advantage.</p>
      <p>The Lady Bulldogs seek to close it out in Game 2 on Saturday.     </p>
