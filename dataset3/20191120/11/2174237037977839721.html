      <p>YouTuber Gabriel Guardian has released a video of his cover version of the <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/aerosmith-a-guide-to-their-best-albums">Aerosmith</a> classic <i>Dream On</i>. So far, so meh. But what makes Gabriel's take unique is that he tackles both guitar and keyboard parts <i>at the same time</i>, the clever sod.</p>
      <p>"I've always loved this song, especially the vocal melody and solos!" says the multi-tasking muso. "Hope you like my interpretation of this Aerosmith classic filmed live in one-take at Red Rock Canyon in Las Vegas." </p>

      <p>Guardian has one of those ambidextrous brains. The Texas multi-instrumentalist made something of a noise back in 2016 when he filmed himself covering <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-best-iron-maiden-songs-of-all-time">Iron Maiden</a>’s 1983 classic <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/watch-this-man-cover-the-trooper-on-guitar-and-synth-at-the-same-time"><i>The Trooper</i> on guitar and a synth</a>.</p>
      <p>The following year he tackled <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-beatles-best-albums-buyers-guide-collection">The Beatles</a>’ 1966 classic <i>Eleanor Rigby</i>. Originally a heart-breaking treatise on loneliness and the treatment of the elderly, in Guardian’s ambidextrous hands it became something more bombastic, a festival of fleet-fingered soloing filmed in front of a cathedral.</p>
