      <p>Caitlyn Jenner's mother Esther has come out to say she won't be watching her daughter on <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/im-celebrity-reveals-two-brand-new-campmates-343700"><i>I'm A Celeb</i></a>.</p>
      <p>The reality star made her debut on the show over the weekend and was the first to take on a bush tucker trial.</p>
      <p>Her mother however, admits, "That's not entertainment to me."</p>

      <p>As per <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7703785/Caitlyn-Jenners-mother-WONT-watching-Im-Celeb.html"><i>MailOnline</i></a>, Esther opens up about her daughter's latest excursion in a world exclusive interview.</p>
      <p>She explains, "We have the survivor show here in the United States, I never watched it. I've skimmed over it, or seen previews and I decided that I don't really care for that.</p>
      <p>"I know it's very popular in England and Australia, I don't know maybe people like to see other people uncomfortable or frightened or whatever, I don't like that."</p>

      <p>She goes on, "I like to see people peaceful, happy. That's not entertainment to me, to see somebody frightened.</p>
      <p>"I think she could spend a lot more pleasant times on the golf course! I've tried not to think of Caitlyn being over there. It's three weeks, a long time to go without hearing from her."</p>
      <p>It seems <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/caitlyn-jenner-says-being-trans-was-dirty-secret-family-343596"><i>Caitlyn</i></a> and Esther have a strong mother/daughter relationship.</p>

      <p>Esther reveals, "When she's in the States she calls me almost every day. I've got to live without hearing from her."</p>
      <p>Like any mother, Esther worries her daughter could get hurt in the jungle, "I have no idea why she's doing this.</p>
      <p>"I don't ask her questions to get into her mind or how she feels about this or that. My big worry is she may get bitten by a snake or a poisonous insect."</p>

      <p>She added: "I don't want you to say anything that's going to frighten or upset me, I'm better off not to know. We can see it her in the United States. I don't need to torture myself, if it's frightening, I don't want to know.</p>
      <p>"I'll just be waiting for when she can call me again when it's over. I'm sure I'll hear about it on the news."</p>
      <p>Despite her disapproval of the show, she thinks Caitlyn has a chance at winning the show, she said: "The thing about Caitlyn, and I know her well, is that she has a lot of determination."</p>
