      <p>A thug who severely injured his <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/ayrshire/">Kilmarnock</a> partner by accelerating his car while she was leaning through the window has been told he could be sentenced at the High Court.</p>
      <p>Lewis Reid drove his car away at speed while his girlfriend Codey Brown was speaking to him through the window.</p>
      <p>As a result the 18-year-old was flung into the air, resulting in serious injuries, and was rushed to Crosshouse Hospital.</p>
      <p>Reid appeared at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court after he pleaded guilty to the offence along with a further 21 charges. His not guilty pleas to another 26 charges were accepted by the Crown.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old drove off after a heated argument about Ms Brown’s friend.</p>
      <p>The court heard Ms Brown took her own life in March following the incident, which took place on Danny Coffey Avenue, Kilmarnock, in August 2018.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage of the horrifying incident was played for the court, showing Reid drive off in a bright red/orange Ford Fiesta.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor said: “Neighbours saw the car speeding off and Codey in the air with her feet off the ground.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ms Brown was bleeding from her head and was rushed to hospital, where it was revealed she had a 2cm cut on the right of her head as well as abrasions to both knees and fractures to her rib and left wrist, which was put in a plaster.</p>
      <p>Reid, of Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, also admitted a number of offences of handling stolen cars, drug dealing and dangerous driving across Ayrshire and Glasgow.</p>
      <p>The prisoner of Barlinnie drove a stolen car at up to 120mph from Fenwick towards Kilmarnock Road on October 26 last year and was seen holding his mobile phone out the window to film police pursuing him with blue lights.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told how Reid was driving on the wrong side of the road and speeding at up to 85mph on the hard shoulder of the M77 in a bid to avoid the police.</p>
      <p>He also handled stolen cars and broke a number of bail conditions imposed by Kilmarnock and Paisley Sheriff Courts.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On June 3 this year Reid took a woman on a date to a restaurant in Prestwick in a stolen Mercedes.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the court Reid was seen to be constantly checking his phone during the meal and, when he was alerted to the police outside, “immediately asked for the bill even though the woman was still eating”.</p>
      <p>Reid took his date up an alleyway outside the restaurant, where he told her to run when he saw police.</p>
      <p>He then returned to his car and ignored police calls to switch off the engine.</p>
      <p>Officers chased him through the streets of Prestwick towards Seaforth Road in Ayr.</p>
      <p>It was also revealed to the court that Reid operated under the name Gucci in order to deal drugs via Snapchat and in July this year he sold MDMA crystals to an 18-year-old in Glasgow.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The prosecutor told the court the teenager and two others were later rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary because they were “unable to control their body temperature” after consuming the MDMA.</p>
      <p>Among the teenagers was 16-year-old Chelsea Bruce, who died in hospital.</p>
      <p>Reid also admitted another two acts of dangerous driving on July 13 and July 18 on the streets of Glasgow and the M77, including speeding through a red light and into oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>On July 18 he also intentionally reversed his car and collided with an unmarked police car and was found to be in the possession of cocaine and ketamine.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane deferred sentencing until next month for reports to be prepared. She told Reid: “I have to warn you I am seriously considering sending you to the High Court. I’m not sure my powers are enough so prepare for that.”</p>
