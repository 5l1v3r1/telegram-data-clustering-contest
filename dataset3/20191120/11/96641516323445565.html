      <h1>Amazon made big price cuts on its Echo and Fire TV devices for Black Friday</h1>
      <h2>Amazon is discounting a lot of its hardware starting on November 22nd.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:15:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/igor-bonifacic" target="_blank">Igor Bonifacic</a></address>
      <p>Ahead of Thanksgiving next week, Amazon has shared a preview of its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=384082011">Black Friday deals</a>. This year, the company's Black Friday sale will run a full week starting on November 22nd. Amazon will have a lot of different products discounted, but for the purposes of this roundup, we've decided to highlight the company's own hardware.</p>
      <h3>Echo devices</h3>
      <p>Amazon will discount the Echo Dot, its smallest (and most affordable) voice-activated speaker, by $28, making it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Sandstone/dp/B07PGL2N7J/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=83acf62efc2ea1740730235705f5d3df&amp;creativeASIN=B07PGL2N7J">$22</a> instead of $50. It will also sell a three-pack bundle for $65. While we haven't had a chance to review the third-generation Echo Dot, we did like its predecessor, awarding it a score of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/11/21/amazon-echo-plus-dot-sub-2018-review/">86</a> when we reviewed it last year. Amazon says the new version is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/20/amazon-new-echo-dot/">70 percent louder</a> than the second-generation model. Just note that if you want the Echo Dot with "<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925364/amazon-echo-dot-clock-review-third-generation-specs-features-price">time on its side</a>," you'll want to take advantage of the next deal, not this one.</p>

      <p>There's not much to say about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/amazon-echo-dot-clock/">Echo Dot with Clock</a>. It's an Echo Dot with a digital clock on its side that can also display information like the current temperature and any upcoming alarms. Normally it costs $10 more than the base model Echo Dot, but thanks to Black Friday, you'll be able to get it for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen/dp/B07N8RPRF7/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=c624d47af484ae5bd95dedea20840258&amp;creativeASIN=B07N8RPRF7">$35</a> instead of $60 -- which is less than the regular price of the non-clock model.</p>
      <p>Moving on to Amazon's smart displays, the company will discount the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/29/amazon-echo-show-5/">Echo Show 5</a> by $40. So you'll be able to grab it for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-Compact-display-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=d5d95d37950ee15397149753ad98f537&amp;creativeASIN=B07HZLHPKP">$50</a>, as opposed to the usual $90 it costs normally. For $5 more, you can bundle it with an Amazon Smart Plug. We gave the Echo Show 5 an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/24/amazon-echo-show-5-review/">85</a> when we reviewed it earlier this year. We liked the fact the Echo Show 5 could double as a sunrise alarm, as well as how good it sounded in our testing. On the flip side, customizing its display could have been easier.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-11%2F85dc1fc0-03d3-11ea-bcbf-e87da7423553&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=5d28ab76863442fc9290b3b1c15c31560583ac16"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Amazon plans to sell the newest version of its original smart speaker, the aptly named All-new Echo, for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Smart-speaker-Alexa-Charcoal/dp/B07NFTVP7P/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=dd51034a8f03e938a3ba0c3b0b9ea718&amp;creativeASIN=B07NFTVP7P">$60</a>, down from $100. We liked the new Echo a lot when we put it through its paces last month, awarding it a score of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/30/amazon-echo-review-2019-smart-speaker/">90</a>. Highlights include great sound quality and responsive mics.</p>
      <p>If you already own a decent sound setup and don't want to buy a separate smart speaker, look no further than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/20/amazon-echo-input-dongle/">Echo Input</a>. Amazon will sell the Chromecast Audio of the Echo family for a mere <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Input-Bring-Alexa-speaker-/dp/B07BFRHZLB/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=b0d9a48bc25b1e2fdfe39839c4eaad90&amp;creativeASIN=B07BFRHZLB">$15</a>, down from its usual price of $35.</p>
      <h3>Fire TV devices</h3>
      <p>If you want a cheap way to watch Amazon Prime Video originals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/10/good-omens-neil-gaiman-jon-hamm-nuclear-apocalypse/"><i>Good Omens</i></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/31/jack-ryan-season-two-amazon/"><i>Jack Ryan</i></a> on your TV, Amazon will sell the Fire TV Stick (with included Alexa remote) for half off on Black Friday, making it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/streaming-player-Remote-set-up-released/dp/B0791TX5P5/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=57f572755127330ff0bc52f0daa8304e&amp;creativeASIN=B0791TX5P5">$20</a> instead of $40. We liked the Fire TV Stick when we first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014/12/04/fire-tv-stick-review/">reviewed</a> it back in 2014, and Amazon has made it better since.</p>
      <p>It's not a Black Friday if you don't at least consider buying a new TV. If you do end up splurging for a 4K set, Amazon plans to discount the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/03/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k/">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> by $25, so it will be <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stick-Alexa-Remote-streaming-player/dp/B079QHML21/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=ad682e6f2f514ed476b83b375e57a9f0&amp;creativeASIN=B079QHML21">half off</a> just like the regular Fire TV Stick. If you want to buy a discounted Echo Dot while you're at it, you can get both for $47 as part of a bundle.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-11%2F505074a0-0603-11ea-96ed-39ee184601b2&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=93936799cc1786f5739a33d5ce1770c81c73eb46"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Lastly on the Fire TV front is the Fire TV Cube, which will cost <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-hands-free-Alexa-streaming-player/dp/B07KGVB6D6/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=2f594fefd562b821be5ec743ad3e594c&amp;creativeASIN=B07KGVB6D6">$90</a> on Black Friday, down from $120. Uninspiring design and voice control quirks aside, there's a lot to like about Amazon's set-top box. We gave it an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/11/amazon-fire-tv-cube-2019-review/">84</a> when we reviewed it on the back the performance, compatibility and feature enhancements Amazon made.</p>
      <h3>Ring and Eero</h3>
      <p>If you've been thinking about adding a smart doorbell to your home, Amazon plans to discount the Ring Video Doorbell Pro by $70 on Black Friday, which means it will cost <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Doorbell-Activated-Installation-existing/dp/B01DM6BDA4/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=197f7dbe8aa7818e04971849a1d628b6&amp;creativeASIN=B01DM6BDA4">$180</a>. Amazon also plans to offer a $180 bundle that includes both the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and Echo Show 5.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fd6030db0-dfc0-11e9-9dce-7fefafd95243&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=e1c652b3fbc5bb904eb9ec4155ae46ae6e5cc927"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Discounted Echo speakers and Fire TV devices are all well and good, but let's be honest: what you really want this Black Friday is a mesh WiFi. If you haven't jumped on the mesh train, now is the time to do so, with Amazon discounting its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/09/25/amazons-new-eero-mesh-wifi-system-is-all-about-ease-of-use/">Eero WiFi system</a> by $90, so that it only cost <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Amazon-eero-mesh-system/dp/B07WMLPSRL/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=2126be5606efcb7e330e613ed78d9ef0&amp;creativeASIN=B07WMLPSRL">$160</a>. Mesh routers are one of those gadgets that aren't all that exciting at first glance but are life-changing, especially if you live in a large home with WiFi dead spots.</p>
      <h3>Kids Edition products</h3>
      <p>If you're shopping for kids, Amazon hasn't forgotten about you. The company is discounting several of its Kids Edition products, starting with the Fire 7 Kids Edition. Normally the tablet costs $100, but for Black Friday you can get the Fire 7 Kids Edition for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Kids-Tablet-Display-Kid-Proof/dp/B07H8WS1FT/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=b2c956fe651e69d2c0a8cd54900d538f&amp;creativeASIN=B07H8WS1FT">$60</a>. Each Kids Edition product detailed in this post comes with a two-year worry-free guarantee and a complimentary one-year subscription to the company's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012/12/05/amazon-kindle-freetime-unlimited/">FreeTime Unlimited subscription service</a>.</p>
      <p>If your child has been pestering you for their very own Echo Dot, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/06/12/amazon-echo-dot-kids-edition-freetime-2019/">Kids Edition</a> will cost <a href="https://www.amazon.com/designed-parental-controls-worry-free-guarantee/dp/B07Q2MXPH6/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=afb29bb769f2e1153e74056d26283cc4&amp;creativeASIN=B07Q2MXPH6">$40</a>, down from $70. You can also get a three-pack for $120. It too comes with a two-year worry-free guarantee and a complimentary FreeTime Unlimited subscription -- which is why it costs more than the standard Echo Dot.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Last but not least, Amazon will discount the Kindle Kids Edition, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/07/amazon-kindle-kids-edition/">which it announced in October</a>, to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Kids-Tablet-Display-Kid-Proof/dp/B07H8WS1FT/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=productpost2019text-20&amp;linkCode=w00&amp;linkId=b2c956fe651e69d2c0a8cd54900d538f&amp;creativeASIN=B07H8WS1FT">$80</a>, down from $110. In addition to all the usual Kids Edition perks, it comes with a fun-looking kid-proof case. It also has a couple of software tweaks to make the Kindle experience more appealing to younger readers.</p>
