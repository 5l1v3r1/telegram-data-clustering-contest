      <p>The 46-year-old is also charged with ripping out an extension cord and striking a window with it in his ward.</p>
      <p>It is claimed that two days later, Cureton made an abusive remark towards nurse Andrea Jones before allegedly punching health care assistant Caroline Foster on the head and body.</p>
      <p>On December 17 he allegedly threatened to rape a nurse before removing plug sockets and throwing them.</p>
