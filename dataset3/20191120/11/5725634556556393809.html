      <p><b><a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3520710-boeing-scraps-deals-dubai-air-show">Emirates and Boeing are reportedly</a></b> on the verge of striking a compromise deal for the Middle East's biggest carrier to order around 30 787 Dreamliners, but fewer 777X jets as part of a delayed order. Boeing (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA">BA</a>) has only landed about a third of the orders scored by Airbus (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSY">OTCPK:EADSY</a>, <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF">OTCPK:EADSF</a>) at the biennial event. Meanwhile, FAA Administrator Steve Dickson stated on the sidelines of the show that the FAA will be tougher on the certification of the Boeing 777X and isn't following any specific timeline for the return to service of the grounded 737 MAX model. Boeing fell 1% yesterday after the National Transportation Safety Board called on the company to redesign thousands of its 737 planes to better protect against the impact of engine failures. Shares are down another 0.5% in premarket action today.</p>

      <p>Asian stocks fell back after President Trump's threat to raise tariffs on Chinese goods reverberated across the Pacific Ocean. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.8% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was off 0.75%. Japan's Nikkei slipped 0.6% and Australia's ASX 200 dropped dropped 1.2% after a financial regulator cracked down on Westpac Banking (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBK">WBK</a>). Meanwhile, European stocks are also having a soft day, with the Stoxx 600 Index slipping 0.7%. U.S. stock futures are pointing lower, two days removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 Index carving out new record highs.</p>

      <p>The Federal Reserve is due to release minutes today of its last meeting in a development that will pull back the curtain on just how much support there is for a long pause before any further interest rate actions. Economists will also find out if Jerome Powell's view that it would take a "material reassessment" before rates are cut again is on target with the rest of the committee. The consensus view is that the Federal Reserve is right where it wants to be going into an election year as long as no data surprises occur.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong riot police are still surrounding a university campus with a small number of protesters a day after the largest number of arrests and injuries were reported in the city. The protests in Hong Kong continue to draw attention from outside of China. The latest show of support was from the U.S. Senate, which unanimously passed legislation that supports human rights in Hong Kong. That action drew almost immediate criticism from China's foreign ministry. On the investing front, the disruption in Hong Kong has held back investor enthusiasm for casino companies with Macau properties, including Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WYNN">WYNN</a>), Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVS">LVS</a>), MGM Resorts (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGM">MGM</a>) and Melco Resorts &amp; Entertainment (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLCO">MLCO</a>).</p>

      <p>The buzz is building up for Tesla's (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA">TSLA</a>) truck event that is scheduled for tomorrow night in California. Pricing on the Tesla truck will be closely watched with EV startup Rivian setting a starting price of $69K. Details on towing capacity, power output, and off-road capabilities will also be crucially important as Tesla looks to compete with Ford's (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F">F</a>) F-150 line and Ram (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCAU">FCAU</a>) trucks. In other electric truck news, startup Nikola claimed yesterday to have made a huge breakthrough in battery technology that it predicts will disrupt the market. Nikola says it's in discussions with customers for truck orders that could fill production slots for more than ten years and propel Nikola to become the top truck manufacturer in the world by revenue. The next-gen battery technology is also said to have the potential to increase the range of current EV passenger cars to 600 miles from 300 miles. <br/><b>Go deeper:</b> <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA/profitability">See a breakdown of Tesla's profitability grade</a>.</p>
