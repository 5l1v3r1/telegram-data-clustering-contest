      <p>Pochettino, whose side were defeated by Liverpool in the 2018/19 Champions League final, was sacked on Tuesday evening after a string of disappointing resultsa and replaced by Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The former Southampton boss did not go quietly, however, and reportedly refused to resign from his position following weeks of discussion with chairman Daniel Levy about his future.</p>

      <p>According to the <i>Athletic</i>, Spurs were thus left with no choice but to sack the 47-year-old, which contractually forced the club to make a massive £12m (R196 million) pay-out into his account.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was the fifth-longest serving manager in the Premier League at the time of his sacking but had reportedly lost control of the dressing room, with players said to be too afraid to look him in the eye.</p>
