      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida</a> man was arrested Saturday after allegedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/drugs">hiding his meth stash</a> in a peculiar place: <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">his belly button</a>.</p>
      <p>Martin Skelly, a 41-year-old from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">St. Petersburg</a>, was taken into custody after investigators caught him with a 28-gauge needle <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">at a McDonald's</a> in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast">Clearwater</a> and took him in on methamphetamine possession.</p>

      <p>Before he was transported for booking, authorities asked Skelly if he had any other contraband in his possession, warning him he could face additional charges if <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">anything illegal</a> was discovered while he was in jail, <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/stupid/inside-skellys-belly-759024">The Smoking Gun reported</a>, citing an arrest affidavit.</p>

      <p>Skelly denied having anything else, but during intake at the Pinellas County Jail, a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">sheriff's deputy</a> "discovered a small bag of crystal powder substance wedged deep within [his] belly button cavity."</p>
      <p>The substance tested positive for methamphetamine, officials said. Skelly, a 380-pound, 5-foot-9 man, reportedly told an officer after the drugs were found that he "was just being dumb and not thinking."</p>
