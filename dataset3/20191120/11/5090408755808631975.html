        <li>A tufted capuchin at Tianjin Zoo in <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/china">China</a> is looking for love after being single his whole life.</li>
        <li>The unnamed monkey <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5864558/monkey-human-face-zoo-china/">went viral in 2018</a> for his eerily human-like facial features.</li>
        <li>According to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7701043/Monkey-human-face-hopes-wife.html">Daily Mail,</a> zoo officials say the monkey’s singledom is partly due to “a lack of fate.”</li>
        <li>However, they added that the monkey is known for his “aggressive” personality: “[He] likes playing with mud and smashing coconuts.”</li>
        <li>Probably not great first date material.</li>

      <p>Love can be one of life’s greatest joys – but it can also be one of the greatest causes of heartbreak and distress, as a famous monkey in <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/china">China</a> seems to know too well.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7701043/Monkey-human-face-hopes-wife.html">Daily Mail</a> reports that a tufted capuchin at the Tianjin Zoo in China has been single for every one of his 19 years – and zoo officials are now hoping they can help him be a bit luckier in love.</p>

      <p>The unnamed primate, who came to the zoo in 2002, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5864558/monkey-human-face-zoo-china/">went viral last year</a> with an eerily human-like face that launched plenty of memes.</p>

      <p>While zoo officials told the Daily Mail his lack of success in the love department could be due to “a lack of fate,” there could be another reason: apparently, he is not the easiest to get along with.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail reports that the monkey is known for his “aggressive” personality.</p>

      <p>Zoo officials said: “He is very active and aggressive. [He] likes playing with mud and smashing coconuts.” Probably not great first date material.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/20975879#.XdUVxTL7RTY">NBC News</a>, tufted capuchins are also known to rub their hands and feet in urine in order to try and attract a mate. A little off-putting.</p>

      <p>The monkey now has three playmates, but according to the Daily Mail, they are too young to be anything more than friends.</p>

      <p>Perhaps it’s time the monkey undergoes a bit of a personality transformation in order to find a mate. After all, don’t most of us change at least a little for our partners?</p>
