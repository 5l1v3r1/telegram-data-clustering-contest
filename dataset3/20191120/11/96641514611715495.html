      <h1>The 16-inch MacBook Pro has a mysterious 'lid angle sensor'</h1>
      <h2>Is it a simple replacement, or does it do something more?</h2>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/13/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-specs-pricing-hands-on-video/">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> still has some mysteries left after its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-macbook-pro-16-2019-teardown.html">initial teardown</a>. Both <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-lid-angle-sensor/"><i>MacRumors</i></a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106#s250599">iFixit</a> have confirmed the presence of a "lid angle sensor" that appears to replace the usual Hall effect sensor (measuring the magnitude of a magnetic field) used to detect whether the laptop is open or closed. It's not certain what's different, but there's also a magnet in the hinge proper. An Apple support document asks technicians to calibrate the sensor to consider a display repair successful.</p>
      <p>We've asked Apple if it can elaborate.</p>
      <p>The iFixit team has speculated that the sensor might be more sophisticated and track both the frequency and angle of lid openings to help the company diagnose certain problems -- say, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/21/apple-macbook-pro-display-cable-free-repairs/">stress on the display cable</a>. It might have an easier time pinpointing systemic flaws.. However, it's not clear that's the case. For now, the one certainty is that Apple has used the 16-inch MacBook Pro as an opportunity to refresh many aspects of its design, not just obvious changes like the screen or cooling.</p>
