      <p>KUANTAN, Nov 20 — The Pahang government has from today prohibited water recreational and hiking activities in the state throughout the northeast monsoon season for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>State Secretary Datuk Seri Dr Sallehuddin Ishak said the prohibition would be until Jan 20 next year or at a later date.</p>
      <p>Among the activities prohibited are hiking, camping, swimming and fishing in waterfalls, lakes as well beaches.</p>
      <p>“The rainy season can cause a sudden surge of water at waterfalls, an increase in water levels at lakes as well as the high tide and big wave phenomenon,” he said in a statement here today.</p>
      <p>Sallehuddin said local authorities and relevant state government agencies would also increase monitoring particularly during the school holiday season, as well as put warning signs at high-risk areas. — Bernama</p>
