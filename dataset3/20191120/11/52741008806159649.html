      <h1>Byelection to be held in Cambridge</h1>
      <h2>Residents in Ward 7 can expect to cast a ballot in March 2020</h2>

      <p>Back to the polls, we go!</p>
      <p>Cambridge city council has decided to hold a byelection to fill the vacant seat in Ward 7, left behind after the passing of three-term councillor Frank Monteiro on October 15.</p>
      <p>The two main things that came up during discussions around the horseshoe centred around time and money.</p>
      <p>"When you've got a three-year term left, I think the voters and the people of Ward 7 should be able to have an election, have their say on who they want as their representative," says Councillor Shannon Adshade.</p>
      <p>Councillor Nicholas Ermeta agreed with those sentiments.</p>
      <p>"I believe a byelection is the fairest way possible," he said.</p>
      <p>"There is a cost to democracy, there really is.  People have lost their lives for it."</p>
      <p>The cost for a byelection could come in at up to $100,000.</p>
      <p>Those in favour believe it's money well spent, while Councillors Donna Reid and Pam Wolf --- the two arguing against the motion in what turned into a 6-2 vote --- say the money could be better used on something else.</p>
      <p>The two of them pushed for council-led process to appoint someone to the post instead.</p>
      <p>"We can use the Municipal Act as it is written for us to use, and provide Ward 7 with a councillor by January, rather than the end of March," Reid says.</p>
      <p>Nomination day is February 7, 2020, with a proposed byelection date coming March 23, 2020.</p>
