      <h1>Opposition seeks Governor’s intervention in breaking RTC strike stalemate</h1>
      <h2>Peaceful stir on for 45 days and 21 employees die of agony caused by the CM KCR and Ministers’ provocative statements, they allege</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:32:17+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-Rajeev-995/" target="_blank">M. Rajeev</a></address>
      <p>The State’s opposition parties, including the TDP, CPI, BJP, and the Telangana Jana Samiti sought the intervention of Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan in facilitating negotiations between the agitating TSRTC employees unions and the State government.</p>
      <p>A delegation called on the Governor at Raj Bhavan on Wednesday and requested her to take steps to not just resolve the demands of the striking workers, but also to preserve the public transport system in Telangana. The delegation comprised of TDP Telangana president L. Ramana, TJS president M. Kodandaram, CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy, BJP’s B. Mohan Reddy and others.</p>
      <h3>Gripe at MD’s ‘political behavior’</h3>
      <p>In a memorandum submitted to the Governor, the delegation took strong objection to the ‘political behavior’ of TSRTC in-charge Managing Director Sunil Sharma for commenting in his affidavit submitted to the court that political parties were influencing the workers’ unions. The comment assumes significance in the light of the High Court’s comments cautioning civil servants who were “playing into the hands of the ruling party”.</p>
      <p>The delegation recalled that the strike is on peacefully for the past 45 days and the agitating workers were not fighting for their monetary benefits. Four workers ended their lives and another 21 died due to agony caused by the provocative statements of the Ministers and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao himself.</p>
      <h3>No solace or succour</h3>
      <p>Though the kith and kin of the families were living in stress, neither officials nor Ministers visited any of these bereaved families, nor any support offered to them. The government’s apathy to hold discussions with the employees unions in spite of the court’s direction to the State to ensure that the warring parties were brought to the negotiating table is obvious.</p>
      <p>“In spite of the best efforts of the unions, political parties and even the High Court, the State government is turning a deaf ear to the crisis,” they memorandum said.</p>
