      <h1>Gigi Hadid ‘in touch with’ ex Zayn Malik and are we ready for this? Again?</h1>

      <p>Not long after she split from Tyler Cameron, Gigi Hadid has been chatting with her ex <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/zayn-malik/">Zayn Malik</a>, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Word on the street is the model ‘has always had a soft spot’ for the former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> singer, who she began <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> in 2015, and ‘they have a lot of history together.’</p>
      <p>The pair first started lip-smacking about their potential union in November of 2015, and after a couple on and off moments, they officially announced that they were splitting via Twitter in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Sad times for all.</p>
      <p>While Zayn has kept his love life on the DL and Gigi was apparently romancing some dude from the Bachelorette, now sources are claiming they’re back in one another’s DMs.</p>

      <p>‘They went through a phase where they took time apart and weren’t communicating at all, but they have been in touch recently,’ a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/1095111/gigi-hadid-is-back-in-touch-with-zayn-malik-after-her-split-from-tyler-cameron">source told E! Online</a>.</p>

      <p>‘She is supportive of him. They chat here and there but it’s been casual.’</p>
      <p>Nothing wrong with a bit of friendly ex communication, right? Well, actually, probably very wrong – but for the purposes of this article we’ll persevere.</p>
      <p>Anyway, we shouldn’t get our hopes up for a rekindling of any type so sorry for anyone who is thinking Met Gala 2020 may yet see this genetically-blessed pair join fashionable forces once again.</p>

      <p>The source added: ‘They are definitely not getting back together but are on good terms right now.’</p>
      <p>Last month Gigi<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/19/gigi-hadid-lets-jumper-talking-split-tyler-cameron-10944910/"> let her shirt do the talking following her split from Tyler</a>, as she wore a jumper emblazoned with ‘Boys lie: goodbye’ on it. Which was quite telling if you ask us (well aware you haven’t asked us, so this information is free).</p>
      <p>Gigi was first spotted with Tyler at the beginning of August. They were later seen at the Zendeya x Tommy Hilfiger fashion show for New York Fashion Week, before the reality star accompanied the supermodel to her grandmother’s funeral.</p>
      <p>However, a source close to Gigi said in early October that the supermodel is no longer dating Tyler.</p>
      <p>Neither party ever confirmed the relationship although Tyler told ET: ‘I mean… that’s just where we’re at.</p>

      <p>‘Our relationship doesn’t need to be public.</p>
      <p>‘She’s an amazing person and we’re just keeping it friendly.’</p>
