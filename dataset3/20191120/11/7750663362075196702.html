      <h1>Real Madrid 'will not sell Isco in January'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> are reportedly not open to selling <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/isco/"><b>Isco</b></a> in January despite the attacker's struggles this season.</h2>

      <p>The 27-year-old has only made six La Liga appearances for Los Blancos during the 2019-20 campaign, while he has featured in just one of their four Champions League fixtures.</p>
      <p>There have been suggestions that Madrid could look to sell the Spaniard at the start of 2020, but according to <i>Marca</i>, that is not an option in the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>A hamstring injury saw the attacker miss six matches earlier this season, but he has struggled to break into <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>'s first XI upon his return to fitness.</p>
      <p>In all, the playmaker, who has also lost his spot in the Spain squad, has scored 48 times in 284 appearances for Madrid since arriving from Malaga.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the former Valencia youngster has a contract at the Bernabeu until the summer of 2022.</p>
