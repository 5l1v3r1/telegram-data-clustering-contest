      <p>Justice Joyce Abdulmaleek of the Federal High Court, Ibadan on Wednesday sentenced a drug kingpin, Tajudeen Tela to life imprisonment for trafficking 37 kg of Indian Hemp.</p>
      <p>In her judgment, Abdulmaleek said that Tela was convicted and sentenced based on the evidence before her and the fact that he pleaded guilty to the crime.</p>
      <p>“In view of the overwhelming evidence against Tela, I cannot but apply the full weight of the law on him.</p>
      <p>“As a result, the convict is sentenced to a maximum of life imprisonment without an option of fine.</p>
      <p>“The Toyota Camry and the cash sum of N67, 000 found in possession of the convict are hereby forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Also, the weed substances shall be destroyed by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency,” the Judge said.</p>
      <p>Before the pronouncement, the Defence counsel, Mr Bassey Okon, had prayed the court to have mercy on his client by reducing his jail term.</p>
      <p>Earlier, counsel to the NDLEA, Oyo State Command, Mr Raphael Himinkaiye, had told the court that the convict was facing a one-count bordering on unlawful transportation of cannabis.</p>
      <p>He also said that Tela committed the crime on July 27, 2017, in Ibadan.</p>
      <p>Himinkaiye said the convict was apprehended in possession of 35 parcels of compressed cannabis which weighed 37 kg in a Toyota Camry with Reg. No. KJA91ML and a sum of N67, 000.</p>
      <p>He stated that the offence was contrary to and punishable under Section 11 (B) of the NDLEA Act Cap N30 Law of the Federation 2004.</p>
      <p>Speaking under the condition of anonymity, all the lawyers who witnessed the judgment expressed reservation, describing the judgment as being too ash.</p>
