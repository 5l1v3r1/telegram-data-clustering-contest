      <p>In the lead-up to this General Election, the ITV Evening News is getting out around the country, talking to people, listening to opinions away from the much-discussed Westminster bubble.</p>
      <p>I’m visiting places with an interesting story to tell, to get some sense of what is influencing voters far from Politics Central.</p>
      <p>Our road trip started last week in North East Fife - the UK’s most marginal constituency - won in 2017 by the SNP by just 2 votes.</p>
      <p>How might things work out this time, where every vote will count and there’s all to play for?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>I wish I could report a compelling trend, but I found little appetite for another ballot - those I spoke to seemed weary with all politics: Brexit, Indy Ref 2, another General Election.... most were fed up with it all.</p>
      <p>They didn’t like or much trust their politicians - Leave or Remain, pro- or anti-independence. The one thing they shared was disillusionment.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t a scientific poll - more a series of chats - but the disenchantment was striking.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday in Manchester, ahead of <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2019-11-19/itv-debate-boris-johnson-and-jeremy-corbyn-go-head-to-head/"><b>the ITV Leaders Debate</b></a>, what did people hope to hear from Corbyn and Johnson?</p>
      <p>I spent the morning with students at Salford Uni - several of them first time voters.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>First time voters at Salford University were engaged but cynical to the party messages.<cite>Credit: ITV News</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Here they were passionately engaged with the electoral process - determined to make their voices heard, having missed out on the 2016 Brexit referendum.</p>
      <p>But as to whether they actually believed the right issues would be properly discussed? Not so much.</p>

        <figcaption>Students wanted to hear clear policy details over soundbite politics.<cite>Credit: ITV News</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They complained of soundbite politics and short-term clickbait.</p>
      <p>They badly wanted to hear details about public spending, education, the environment; but expected to be disappointed.</p>
      <p>Filming in the city centre around Canal Street we drew a small crowd of young men.... larking around for the cameras.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When I tried to talk to them they scattered - joking that they didn’t want to be recognised on TV.</p>
      <p>But eventually a couple of them offered their views.</p>
      <p>Superficially, the contrast with the politics-savvy students might have been striking - but the underlying message much the same; politicians didn’t connect with them, they didn’t discuss the important issues, they couldn’t be trusted.</p>
      <p>An LGBT group in a nearby cafe-bar told me of their despair at the short term nature of political engagement.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Where was the nuanced discussion of inclusion, equality, harmony, the environment? They shrugged.</p>
      <p>So far so cynical.</p>
      <p>Next stop Wales.</p>
      <p>Will I strike a rich seam of bright-eyed voters, ready to embrace the coming election with vigour and optimism?</p>
      <p>The signs aren’t good - but I’ll keep trying.</p>
