      <p>This baked celeriac with a lovely Montgomery cheddar cheese sauce is delicious and hearty, and is something you could have on its own as a comforting supper, too. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 1 hour 25 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four to six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>800-900g celeriac</li>
        <li>25g butter, plus a bit for frying</li>
        <li>25g plain flour</li>
        <li>300ml whole milk</li>
        <li>150g Montgomery cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>100g gorgonzola, broken into pieces</li>
        <li>50g breadcrumbs, the drier the better, or panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>20g bacon, roughly chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>A few sage leaves, chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6.</li>
        <li>Wrap the celeriac, sprinkled with a little salt, in foil and set in an ovenproof dish. Add a splash of water to the dish and bake for about an hour, or until the tip of a knife can easily go through the celeriac (think of it like a baked potato).</li>
        <li>When tender, remove the celeriac from the foil and, when cool enough to handle, use a knife to peel away the skin, following the line of the celeriac. Cut the flesh into 2.5cm slices and then cut into roughly diced pieces.</li>
        <li>To make the cheese sauce, melt half the butter in a pan then add the flour and cook for 2 minutes, stirring.</li>
        <li>Add the milk gradually, whisking all the time, until you have a nice thick sauce. Add both cheeses, along with some seasoning, and stir to melt. Check for the consistency – it should be able to coat the back of a wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>When ready, spread the celeriac pieces in an ovenproof dish and cover with the cheese sauce. Bake for 20 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile melt a knob of butter in a frying pan and cook the bacon until crispy. Add the breadcrumbs to the pan to toast, then add the chopped sage before taking off the heat.</li>
        <li>When the celeriac bake is ready, remove from the oven, sprinkle with the crumbs and serve immediately. You could serve this with steamed greens or hispi cabbage, but it is quite hearty on its own.</li>
