      <h2>"As you know I am very fond of Liverpool and the people there"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:15:10+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Gemma Collins has begged her fans to support the seven-year-old girl who has asked Father Christmas for food and a house.</p>
      <p>The heartbreaking letter from the child in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool">Liverpool</a> read: "Dear Father Christmas. Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Mam wants us to be all together, can you give us some food and can I just have just nice doll for Christmas. Thank you."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/dancing-on-ice">Dancing on Ice</a> star <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/gemma-collins">Gemma</a> , 38, was so moved by The ECHO's story she is now urging her Instagram followers to help the child and her family.</p>
      <p>Posting a image of the handwritten note, Gemma wrote: "This is the REALITY of what’s actually going on out there!</p>
      <p>"This was a letter from a child in Liverpool who asked Santa for food this Christmas.</p>
      <p>"As you know I am very fond of Liverpool and the people there.</p>
      <p>"PLEASE let’s help everyone I’m asking can we help this family and family’s like this."</p>

      <p>The letter <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/desperate-child-7-writes-note-17273049">was first shared by local Labour councillor, Gerard Woodhouse</a> who runs the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">L6 Community Centre,</a> on Queens Road, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton">Everton</a> when he posted a photo on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>The team at the community building had started decorating for Christmas and had placed a 'Santa postbox' in the café for children who were visiting the centre to post their Christmas wishlists.</p>
      <p>However, as <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/grim-reality-desperately-trying-survive-16765645">Cllr Woodhouse</a> was passing the postbox he found the upsetting note that asked Father Christmas whether he could help.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">told the ECHO:</a> "This is what we're in sadly. What is upsetting is a seven-year-old in November is already worrying about Christmas.</p>
      <p>"No wonder young people have mental health problems, it's just so sad.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately it is what we see at the L6 centre.</p>
      <p>"This is just one of many that we're going to see from now until Christmas."</p>

      <p>Since the then, the letter has gone viral and offers of support have flooded in.</p>
      <p>The child has also received an <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/football-star-child-father-christmas-17277713">incredible offer from a local football star,</a> who does not want to be named.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> , he said: "I would love to get in touch with the family and help them have a good Christmas.</p>
      <p>"Every Christmas I always want to help people less fortunate and to see people who live in the same city as us struggling to give their children what most kids get kills me.</p>
      <p>"Also to see the child is not feeding properly is a disgrace and the country as a whole should make sure that’s not the case.</p>
      <p>"How there can be people in our country in poverty is beyond belief."</p>
      <p>He added that he wouldn't want the child to go into school and not be able to say that they received something special for Christmas.</p>

      <p>He said: "Also that child will go into school and have kids saying 'I got this, I got that, what did you get?' and they either have to respond nothing special or lie and make things up.</p>
      <p>"I want to help so that this child can feel special and equal to other kids because they’re not inferior and may feel they’re a bad child as every one says if your good Father Christmas will get you what you ask for."</p>
      <p>Aside from the small request of a doll, the footballer said that it was devastating the child was asking for basic necessities such as shelter and food.</p>
      <p>He added: "And in this case things are that bad the child is asking for what most take for granted and at that young age should be worrying about what game to play next not what meal comes next."</p>
      <p>The centre has also set up a GoFundMe page to support their foodbank and Christmas appeal.</p>
