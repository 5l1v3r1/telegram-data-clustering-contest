      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/general-election-2019-main-parties-stand-key-issues-11181412/">As the General Election draws closer,</a> latest odds suggest that the Conservatives are on course for a win following the ITV <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/johnson-corbyn-clash-general-election-debate-11184324/">leaders debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn last night.</a></p>
      <p>According to bookmakers Coral, the Tories – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-surge-ahead-election-polls-ahead-tv-debate-11179542/">who were already ahead in the polls before the debate</a> – now have odds of just 1-20 of winning the most seats at the polls on 12 December – with Labour’s odds of an overall majority having drifted.</p>
      <p>Since the debate – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/public-divided-won-itv-general-election-debate-11184934/">which left viewers divided as to who won</a> – the Labour party’s odds on that front are now a distant 25-1 – behind no majority being reached, which is second in the betting at 7-4.</p>
      <p>‘Johnson and Corbyn locked horns last night for the first leadership debate but the reaction from a betting point of view is that the Conservatives are continuing to motor towards a majority,’ said Coral’s Harry Aitkenhead.</p>

      <p>‘We have them as the overwhelming favourites to win the most seats and they are odds on to claim the majority that Johnson is desperate for.’</p>

      <p>With odds having shortened on a Conservative win, the odds on Brexit happening have also dropped, with the bookmaker now offering odds of 1-2 on the UK having left the EU by 1 February.</p>

      <p>‘Brexit was a major talking point last night, unavoidably’ Aitkenhead added, ‘and we make it odds on that the UK has finally left the EU by February the 1st, 2020.’</p>
      <p>Here’s how the betting for the election is currently shaping up.</p>
