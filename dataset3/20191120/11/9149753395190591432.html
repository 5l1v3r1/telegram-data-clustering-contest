      <h1>Fortnite patch notes bring back the bandage bazooka</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:18:27+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/harry-shepherd/" target="_blank">Harry Shepherd</a></address>
      <p>What's in the Fortnite patch notes 11.20? Another week means a new Fortnite update, and we're here to give you a breakdown on everything we know that's coming to the game, along with various bug fixes and improvements.</p>
      <p>One of those is the highly anticipated bandage bazooka, a useful rocket launcher that allows you to heal your comrades from a distance. We thought it was due to return last week but, this time, our patience has been rewarded. The other headline is <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/fortnite-is-getting-directx-12-support-and-amd-is-ready-with-a-new-gpu-driver/">DirectX12 support for Fortnite</a>: on compatible graphics cards, PC players can now chase further Victory Royales with a higher and steadier frame rate, thanks to CPU optimisations.</p>
      <p>This season Epic Games have chosen to not share their full Fortnite patch notes, but this time, we've got a little more information. There's also still plenty that can be gleaned from the company's Trello board and after some time with the game when it returns. So, here's everything we know about the latest Fortnite update so far.</p>
