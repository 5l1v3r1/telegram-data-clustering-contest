      <p>Fresh from the release of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/idkhow/">iDKHOW</a>’s surprise <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/idkhow-have-just-dropped-a-christmas-ep/">Christmas EP</a>, it looks like <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/blink-182/">blink-182</a> are the next band in line to embrace the festive spirit.</p>
      <p>In a new video with Hannah Stocking for Shots Studios, drummer Travis Barker and his daughter Alabama play Jenga (fun fact: it’s a game Travis has somehow <i>never</i> played before) while answering questions, and the sticksman reveals when asked what music he’s been listening to recently: “This Christmas song that I just made with my band blink-182.” Whoa!</p>
      <p>Cue the lyrics, ‘<i>It’s Christmas Eve and I’ve only wrapped two fuckin’ presents…</i>’ not leaving our heads for the foreseeable future now. Stay tuned to Kerrang.com for more news on blink-182’s Christmas effort.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/travis-barker-i-looked-death-in-the-face-and-survived/">new interview with Kerrang!</a>, Travis spoke of his life and career at length. Discussing the pop-punks’ reunion and how it affected him, the drummer said: “I had already accepted that it was over, so when it did come back and we did a reunion tour, that was cool. It was fun to be around <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/tom-delonge/">Tom [DeLonge</a>, former frontman] again, and it was fun to be around Mark again, but I could always kind of feel the vibe that Tom really liked doing his own thing – probably even more so than blink. Whereas I always kept it as a priority, even if I was on tour with Wayne or if I was working with whoever, whatever rapper, whenever I was doing Transplants, whatever people would see me doing. Whenever blink came around, it was always my priority. Tom – and I love him to death – but I felt blink was no longer the priority for him. It was like, ‘Oh, let’s do this reunion tour, but I really want to get back to doing my own thing.’ And I respected that in some ways, and I guess I could see Tom’s focus was somewhere else. Then eventually I felt like I had even more respect for him because he was like, ‘Look, I don’t want to actually do this anymore, and I want to go do this, this and this.’ For him to walk away from such a big monster, a big machine like that, I have nothing but respect.”</p>
      <p>When asked if he still keeps in touch with Tom, Travis responded: “Yeah, I do. We talk, even if it’s only through text, like, ‘Hey, are you cool? How’s the tour?’ I’ll say, ‘Man, everything’s great, and I hope you’re doing good.’ Whatever. It’s just small talk really, but yeah, we definitely keep in touch, just to check in.”</p>
