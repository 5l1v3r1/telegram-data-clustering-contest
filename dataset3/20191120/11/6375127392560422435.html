      <h1>Golden Triangle now main shabu source — PDEA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:31:05+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/alfred-p-dalizon" target="_blank">Alfred P. Dalizon</a></address>
      <h3>THE Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency has tagged a ‘Golden Triangle’ syndicate which operates on the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand as the main source of drugs now being smuggled into the country, not China which has already launched a massive crackdown on secret drug laboratories in the mainland.</h3>
      <p>PDEA chair, Director General Aaron N. Aquino said that shabu being sold in the country mainly comes from the Golden Triangle Syndicate while MDMA or the designed drug called ‘Ecstasy’ is usually smuggled from The Netherlands and other European countries.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, cocaine comes from Colombia and Peru. At present, marijuana and its more expensive variety called ‘Kush’ are known to be grown in the mountains of Kalinga and other parts of Cordillera region.</p>
      <p>Records also show that out of the 1,003 foreign drug personalities arrested in the country from 2001 to last October, 590 or 59 percent are Chinese nationals followed by Americans and Nigerians with 60 and 42 respectively.</p>
      <p>There is a geographical shift to the Golden Triangle drug syndicate as the main source of shabu in Southeast Asia and other nearby regions since Chinese drug manufacturers apparently have felt the massive government pressure.</p>
      <p>“Noong 2017 pababa, karamihan ng drugs nanggagaling sa China then nagkaroon ng geographical shift. By 2018, nagkaroon ng Golden Triangle drug syndicate sa border ng Laos, Myanmar at Thailand. Sila na ang biggest distributor ng drugs sa Southeast Asia, umaabot sa Australia, US, Europe,” the PDEA chief said.</p>
      <p>This is evident, the retired police general said, in a series of major drug seizures made by Philippine authorities of shabu packed in Chinese tea bags which he explained are used by the Golden Triangle to make it appear the package came from China.</p>
