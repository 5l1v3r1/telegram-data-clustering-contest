      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts’ <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/who-is-im-a-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-kate-holderness-11183108/">girlfriend Kate Holderness</a> has revealed she had a pretty embarrassing moment when she thought she saw <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> before the stars were properly introduced in I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here!.</p>
      <p>Emphasis on the <i>thought</i>…</p>
      <p>Kate and the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/big-brother/">Big Brother</a> series 3 star were fortunate enough to enjoy Hamilton where Adele’s partner got way too excited when her eyes deceived her and ‘Kate Garraway’ walked into the auditorium.</p>

      <p>‘Fun #imaceleb fact: We sat next to @kategarraway at Hamilton a couple of weeks ago,’ Kate wrote on her Instagram. ‘I saw someone who looked like Kate across the theatre &amp; I shouted “OH MY GOD KATE GARRAWAY’S HERE” and then it wasn’t her…and then I turned around &amp; she was sat next to me.</p>

      <p>‘Morto’d. Need to control my fangirling.’</p>
      <p>Well, Kate will finally get to meet the Good Morning Britain presenter when she eventually heads out to Australia to spend two weeks at Brisbane’s Versace Hotel where the I’m A Celebrity stars’ friends and families get to stay while watching their loved ones sleep on floors with snakes and chow down on pigs’ anuses for the sake of a hot meal.</p>
      <p>Adele has come under fire already this week after causing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-clash-as-he-mocks-jane-mcdonalds-legacy-thats-prejudice-11183514/">a huge row with Roman Kemp over Jane McDoanld.</a></p>
      <p>The former Loose Women panelist and queen of the cruises has been at the centre of I’m A Celeb’s biggest blow up so far without even dipping her toe into the jungle.</p>
      <p>The Radio One DJ’s girlfriend swiftly <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">cleared up where Adele’s obsession with Wakefield’s answer to Celine Dion came from</a> after the reality star bright <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">a photograph of the singer into camp as her luxury item.</a></p>

      <p>‘All the campmates have to have different luxury items, they’re not allowed to double up on anything,’ Kate began.</p>
      <p>‘So Adele’s first choice of a family photo was already taken which she didn’t mind because she knew there’d be campmates who’d love a pic of their children in there with them.</p>

      <p>‘Second choice, a pillow, was another goner as it’s usually the most requested item. Pretty much everything she wanted after that was already taken too.’</p>
