      <h1>NRC soon in entire country: Amit Shah</h1>
      <h2>Clarifies that there would be no discrimination on the basis of religion</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:42:28+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:42</time> by <a rel="author">Our Bureau</a></address>
      <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah told the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday that the National Registry of Citizens will be implemented throughout the country.</p>
      <p>He assured that there is no provision under the NRC that it can be used against people who belong to one particular religion. “It is applicable to everyone. This law does not differentiate between people on religious lines,” he said.</p>
      <p>Adding that misconceptions are there about NRC and Citizenship Bill, he said: “The process of National Register of Citizens will be carried out across the country. No one irrespective of their religion should be worried. It is just a process to get everyone under the NRC,” he said during question hour in the Upper House. “NRC is a different process and the Citizenship Amendment Bill is different,” Shah added.</p>
      <h3>NRC and Assam</h3>
      <p>In Assam, he said, the NRC process will be carried out again when it is done in the entire country. “Tribunals will be constituted across Assam. If any person doesn’t have the money to approach tribunals, then the Assam government will bear the cost to hire a lawyer,” he said.</p>
      <h3>‘Normalcy in Kashmir’</h3>
      <p>On another question on Kashmir, the Home Minister said normalcy has been established in Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Shah said schools, colleges and other educational institutions are fully functional and government offices are also open.</p>
      <p>He reiterated the government’s claim not a single bullet has been fired the Valley since the abrogation of Article 370.</p>
      <p>He said Section 144 is prevalent in just a few areas and it is lifted from majority of the places in the valley.</p>
      <p>Shah assured the House that internet will be reinstated in the State once the administration feels that the atmosphere is conducive for it.</p>
      <p>“As far as Internet service is concerned, an appropriate action will be taken on the recommendation of the local administration. Neighbouring country is still doing some mischief and we will restore the connection as soon as the local administration says it is fit to do so,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If any one has information that a particular person in a remote area is not getting medical facility, they can contact me directly. I will get it done in 24 hours,” Shah said.</p>
