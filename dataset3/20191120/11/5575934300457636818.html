      <p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s fresh attacks on China are stoking tensions with Facebook’s Chinese employees, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/zuckerbergs-anti-china-rhetoric-roils-facebook-employees">The Information</a>.</p>
      <p>The Information doesn’t go into detail but writes that Zuckerberg’s increasingly aggressive stance on Beijing’s free-speech policies isn’t going down well with Facebook’s base of Chinese employees, many of whom are from mainland China.</p>
      <p>During a speech at Georgetown University last month, for example, Zuckerberg went on the attack <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/mark-zuckerberg-china-tiktok-censorship-2019-10">criticising Chinese state censorship and TikTok</a>, a social-media platform and growing rival to Facebook that is operated by the Chinese tech giant ByteDance.</p>
      <p>Some view Zuckerberg’s increased anti-China rhetoric as an attempt to please US lawmakers and to fend off regulation. But it also risks creating an internal divide.</p>
      <p>Chinese employees have also taken note of criticism made by executives associated with Facebook, The Information reported.</p>
      <p>The Facebook board member Peter Thiel launched <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/peter-thiel-fbi-cia-probe-google-china-links-2019-7">a tirade against Google in July</a> as being “infiltrated” by Chinese operatives and called the company “treasonous.” He did not offer any evidence to back up his claims.</p>

      <p>The tension has been exacerbated by the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/one-person-dead-by-suicide-at-facebook-office-building-2019-9">suicide of a Chinese employee</a> at Facebook’s San Francisco headquarters in September. A Chinese Facebook engineer was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/firing-of-chinese-facebook-engineer-prompts-anger-in-china-2019-10">fired in October</a> after reportedly being asked to stop talking about his colleague’s death, and his admonishment of the company went viral on Chinese social media.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg’s anti-China rhetoric is a recent phenomenon, as previously the company has tried to move into China.</p>
      <p>Facebook is one of many American tech companies that are not allowed to operate in the country, being placed behind the so-called Great Firewall. As recently as 2016, Facebook was considering an acquisition of the Shanghai-based lip-syncing app Musical.ly as a way to break into the Chinese market. The deal never came, however, and Musical.ly was bought by ByteDance in 2017 and merged into what is now TikTok.</p>
