      <p>A blaze that injured one man and extensively damaged a south Vancouver apartment building is now considered suspicious.</p>
      <p>Vancouver police Sgt. Steve Addison says detectives believe the blaze that started early Tuesday morning was sparked outside the apartment in the Marpole neighbourhood, then spread to the three-storey building.</p>
      <p>He says witnesses report hearing fireworks and seeing a group of people walking away at the time of the blaze.</p>
      <p>Firefighters rescued numerous residents from balconies, while two others, including a 33-year-old unconscious man, had to be pulled to safety from a smoke-filled hallway.</p>
      <p>Addison says that man is recovering from serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Police are now appealing for witnesses, video or any other evidence that can help the investigation.</p>
      <p>"We believe someone out there knows how this fire started. We're asking them to do the right thing and come forward," Addison says in a statement.</p>
      <p>The fire destroyed or significantly damaged many of the suites in the 24-unit building, and endangered dozens of people, he says.</p>
