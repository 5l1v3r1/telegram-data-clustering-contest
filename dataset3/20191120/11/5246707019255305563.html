      <p>While <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/feature_best_pokemon_games_of_all_time">Pokémon</a></b> is unquestionably a worldwide phenomenon, it's especially popular in its native Japan, as the first sales figures for <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword And Shield</a></b> can attest.</p>
      <p>The latest mainline entry in the series has sold 1,364,544 physical copies in its first three days of release. that impressive total includes boxed units – (both Sword, Shield and the double pack) and download cards, but does not factor in digital sales, so the actual number is bound to be much higher.</p>
      <p>That stunning opening means that Pokémon Sword And Shield has beaten the previous fastest-seller in Japan, <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></b> – which cleared 1.23 million units in the same timeframe.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/nintendo_switch_looks_set_to_end_ps4s_five-year_reign_in_the_uk">Just like in the UK</a>, the release of Sword and Shield has given Switch hardware figures a welcome boost, too. A whopping 180,136 Switch systems were sold between November 11th and 17th. However, it's worth noting that around 100,000 more were sold in the week that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate launched.</p>
      <p>In short, Sword and Shield have provided Nintendo with yet another smash hit – and plenty of forward momentum as we head into the holiday season.</p>
