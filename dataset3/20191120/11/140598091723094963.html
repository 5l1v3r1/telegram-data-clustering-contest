      <p>The best way to use up any leftover Christmas turkey? Make this a hearty, warming soup for a lovely Boxing Day lunch. You can use this stock recipe for other dishes, too. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 20 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>1 hour 45 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the stock:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 turkey or chicken carcase, and any bones</li>
        <li>2 carrots, peeled and cut into large dices</li>
        <li>2 sticks of celery, halved</li>
        <li>1 small onion, peeled, cut in half</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally</li>
        <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>To finish the soup:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Knob of butter</li>
        <li>½ tsp picked thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 leek, sliced and washed</li>
        <li>2 parsnips, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>2 tsp tomato purée</li>
        <li>100g pearl barley</li>
        <li>2 tbsp chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>Olive oil, to serve</li>
        <li>Freshly grated parmesan, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <p>METHOD</p>
      <ol>
        <li> If there is any meat still left on the carcase or bones, pick it off and leave to one side. About 200g is a handy amount, so add any leftover ham or chicken too.</li>
        <li>Add the carcase and bones to a large pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Skim off any froth or residue that rises to the surface and add the vegetables, garlic and thyme.</li>
        <li> Simmer for an hour to produce a nice light stock. When the taste is to your liking, remove from the heat and strain the stock.</li>
        <li>Separate the vegetables from the carcase and place them in a sieve or colander (discarding the thyme sprig and garlic skins). Use a ladle to press the vegetables through so you have something like a purée. Keep to one side.</li>
        <li>In another pan, heat the butter and add the thyme, garlic, leek and parsnips. Sauté for four minutes then add the tomato purée and cook for three minutes.</li>
        <li> Add the pearl barley and pour over 1.2 litres of the turkey stock. Cook on a low simmer for 30 minutes, or until the pearl barley is cooked.</li>
        <li>Just before serving, add the turkey along with the puréed vegetables and heat through. Finish with parsley, a good glug of olive oil and some parmesan.</li>
      </ol>
