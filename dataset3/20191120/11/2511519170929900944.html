      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>‘s Supporters’ Trust has said there are “obviously concerns” after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> was appointed the club’s new manager on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese’s return to management was confirmed less than 24 hours after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Mauricio_Pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a>‘s five-and-a-half-year reign was brought to an end.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has signed a contract lasting until 2023 and said “the quality of both the squad and the academy excites me”, while chairman <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Daniel_Levy">Daniel Levy</a> added that Mourinho “has won at every club he’s managed”.</p>
      <p>The Supporters’ Trust also expressed worry over the club’s long-term vision with the possibility of finding themselves in the “same position in two or three years’ time”.</p>
      <p>In a statement released this morning, the Supporters’ Trust said: ”There are obviously concerns about how Jose and our club’s executive board will work together, and we are sure all fans would appreciate greater clarity on how the club sees this relationship operating in practice.</p>
      <p>“The questions around transfer policy, wages and accountability raised in our earlier statement on Mauricio Pochettino’s sacking still apply and we encourage the club to communicate their plans thoroughly and transparently with their fan base.</p>
      <p>“The club must ensure it does not find itself in the same position in two or three years’ time, and we need to hear from the executive board what the long-term thinking behind this appointment is, and how it sees its role.</p>
      <p>“As a supporters organisation, we hope for a successful future that respects the unique Tottenham Hotspur identity and the traditions Spurs fans cherish so dearly.”</p>
