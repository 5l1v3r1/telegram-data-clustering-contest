      <h1>Journalist suggests Liverpool in pole position for Sander Berge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:10:25+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Sander Berge will sign for Liverpool ahead of any other club, including Napoli, should our rumoured interest be genuine.</p>
      <p>That’s according to Italian journalist Ciro Venerato.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Berge? If Napoli goes for a player stalked by Liverpool, they come second,” he told CalcioNapoliTV, cited by <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/come-second-journalist-makes-clear-liverpool-can-beat-club-transfer-chase/">Sport Witness</a>. “It is well known that there are major clubs in the world. They like Berge, but I don’t know if he will come.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old Norwegian plays for Genk in Belgium and has impressed this season in the Champions League especially – performing admirably at Anfield despite our eventual victory.</p>
      <p>He is a good passer of the ball and fairly robust, too, although we’d suggest there’s not really any room in our midfield right now…</p>
      <p>The likes of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Naby Keita, Adam Lallana and James Milner currently do not get in Jurgen Klopp’s first-choice XI – and with Marko Grujic set to return from loan next summer and Curtis Jones developing nicely in the U23s – the manager’s options are plentiful.</p>
      <p>Milner and Lallana’s contract expire in 2020 though, so perhaps we will look to bring in another, younger body to bolster the squad.</p>
      <p>Berge himself is desperate for a move, saying he wants to play at Anfield ‘as often as possible’ [<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/liverpool-target-sander-berge-admits-playing-anfield-dream-11171686/">Metro</a>].</p>
