      <p>John Ameh, Abuja</p>
      <p>A meeting of the Federal Executive Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari has started in Abuja.</p>
      <p>It’s the first FEC meeting after Buhari returned to the country from his private visit in London last week, where he spent 15 days.</p>
      <p>While he was away, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo presided over three FEC meetings.</p>
      <p>Osinbajo is also attending today’s FEC meeting with almost all the ministers in attendance.</p>
      <p>Before proceedings began fully, a minute silence was observed in honour of a former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the late Mr Ufot Ekaette, and a former Minister of Information, the late Chief Alex Akinyele.</p>
