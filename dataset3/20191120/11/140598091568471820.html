      <p>I’ve always been a fan of leftovers, which is partly why Boxing Day is my favourite day of the festive season. It’s an excuse to make the most of what’s left, but also to put my feet up. This risotto is a great dish for making use of bones as well as meat left over from the Christmas Day roast.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>15 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>1 hour 35 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the stock:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 turkey or chicken carcase and any bones</li>
        <li>1 carrot, peeled and cut into large dice</li>
        <li>1 stick of celery, halved</li>
        <li>1 small onion, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>1 head of garlic, cut in half horizontally</li>
        <li>1 sprig of thyme</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the risotto:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
        <li>350g risotto rice</li>
        <li>120g cold butter, diced</li>
        <li>200ml white wine</li>
        <li>Approx 1-1½ litres hot turkey stock</li>
        <li>300g button mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>A generous handful of picked and shredded cooked turkey meat, about 200g</li>
        <li>120g parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>1 tsp chopped tarragon</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>If there is any meat still left on the carcase or bones, pick it off and leave to one side.</li>
        <li> Add the carcase and bones to a large pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Skim off any froth or residue that rises to the surface and add the vegetables, garlic and thyme.</li>
        <li> Simmer for an hour to produce a nice light stock. When the taste is to your liking, remove from the heat and strain the stock through a fine sieve, ready to use for the risotto.</li>
        <li> To make the risotto, heat the olive oil in a pan and cook the onion and garlic over a medium heat for around five minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the rice, along with a spoonful of the butter and stir, toasting the rice for three to four minutes. Add the white wine and continue stirring until it has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Heat the turkey stock and start to add the hot stock a ladleful at a time, stirring regularly and allowing the rice to absorb each lot before adding the next ladleful. This should take about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li> Meanwhile quickly saute the mushrooms in a little butter until pale gold. After all the stock has been added, add the mushrooms and turkey and cook for a further three minutes.</li>
        <li> Remove from the heat and add the remaining butter and the parmesan, mixing well until it has all come together – you should be able to pour it onto a plate like a very thick soup (not spoon it like porridge).</li>
        <li>Finish with the tarragon and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
