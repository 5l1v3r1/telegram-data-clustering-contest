      <h1>Man spotted brushing teeth on Tube and spitting it out on platform</h1>

      <p>London commuters you might want to brace yourselves, for a man has been spotted brushing his teeth on an Underground platform.</p>
      <p>The passenger was caught on camera brazenly cleaning his teeth while waiting for the Tube at Euston – before spitting the toothpaste out onto the platform floor.</p>
      <p>Melissa Thermidor, 37, who snapped the photo, told Metro.co.uk: ‘It was around 9.45am, I was coming from Bushey and waiting for the Northern line, the Bank branch.</p>
      <p>‘He was walking in front of me and I’d noticed he had a toothbrush in his mouth, but at first I thought that can’t be a brush. It must be for show or something.</p>
      <p>‘When we stopped, I saw that he was actively brushing, but I still had faith in humanity, like maybe he’ll swallow it. Maybe there’s nothing in there.</p>

      <p>‘Then he proceeded to spit on the platform in front of everyone and boarded the next train and left. It was absolutely disgusting.</p>

      <p>‘This is peak rush hour. There were plenty of places for him to go somewhere else. He could have asked anyone around him for a tissue or a napkin.’</p>
      <p>The platform had been so packed, Melissa, who is the social media lead for NHS Blood and Transplant, said she couldn’t even fit on the next carriage.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘We don’t know his personal circumstances or whether there was a mental health issue there, but he was smirking a bit.</p>
      <p>‘It felt like he was well aware of what he was doing. Almost like it was cool what he was doing.’</p>
      <p>Melissa also said no one on the platform confronted the man, but several people moved away from where he was standing.</p>
      <p>The first thing that came to her mind was the health and safety hazard spitting on the platform floor could cause.</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘Commutes in the morning are already generally a bit hectic as it is. The biggest thing that came to mind for me was the germs, or what if someone had slipped and fallen.</p>
      <p>‘There are a lot of children travelling at that time in the morning. There were plenty of alternative places he could have disposed of it.</p>
      <p>‘There was even a TfL worker on the platform he could have spoken to if he needed help or assistance.’</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time the London Underground has witnessed flagrant breaches of conduct, with<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/25/dont-guys-public-transport-heatwave-10459994/"> a series of men boarding trains topless during the heatwave earlier this year</a>.</p>

      <p>The half-naked men were photographed by fellow passengers climbing on board carriages wearing just shorts and a pair of shoes.</p>
      <p>While in October, one commuter photographed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/disgusting-thing-tube-10923122/">a giant white splodge on one of the poles in a Jubilee line carriage</a>.</p>
      <p>The image sparked a wide-scale conversation about what the mystery gloop could be, with suggestions including snot, phlegm and chewing gum.</p>
      <p>Mark Evers, Transport for London’s Chief Customer Officer, told Metro.co.uk it is important that ‘everyone is able to travel comfortably’ on the Tube.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘We run regular “Considerate Travel” campaigns to raise awareness of how we can make travelling easier for fellow passengers.</p>
      <p>‘This includes encouraging people to look up to see if a fellow passenger may be struggling to stand and needs a seat, and encouraging people not to play loud music, eat smelly food or wear a backpack on a crowded vehicle.</p>
      <p>‘Clearly, spitting is unacceptable behaviour and is completely at odds with the work we do to ensure everyone has a pleasant journey.’</p>
