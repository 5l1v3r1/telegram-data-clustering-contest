      <p><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/phasefatale">Phase Fatale</a> wrote his second album, <i>Scanning Backwards</i>, with the <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/club.aspx?id=5031">Berghain</a> dance floor in mind. <br/><br/>The US artist, real name Hayden Payne, is a resident at the Berlin techno club. Out on January 24th, the new record will come out on Berghain's in-house label <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=803">Ostgut Ton</a>, which released his <i><a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/reviews/22840">Reverse Fall</a></i> EP in 2018. <br/><br/>"All tracks on the album, no matter the style, were tailored to sound a certain way in Berghainâ€”something I figured out through years of dancing in the middle of the floor, DJing as a resident and investigating what frequencies really penetrate the body," Phase Fatale says. <br/><br/>He continues: "This includes speech and high-frequency, brain-penetrating instrumentation and drilling textures that I had not utilized so often before, but which I think also have an effect on thought and memory. It's especially true in a space where gay and fetish roots combine with music in unexpected ways, almost in a cultish manner. A musical and physical deprogramming and reprogramming, psychic driving and de-patterning, the erasing and replacing of memories." <br/><br/>Revisit Phase Fatale's <i>RA</i> Podcast from 2017.</p>
