      <p>As part of an antitrust probe, the U.S. House Judiciary Committee sent a letter to Apple in September with questions about its policies for the App Store, product repairs, and more. Apple has since responded, and while many of the responses are predictable, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/apple-responds-congress-antitrust-probe/">the letter reveals a few noteworthy details</a>. From a report:<i> For example, when asked to identify the total revenue that it has derived from repair services since 2009, Apple said "the costs of providing repair services has exceeded the revenue generated by repairs" in each year over that period.</i></p>
