      <p>This is a simple recipe but it makes an impressive trifle to serve your guests. Slice the poached pears neatly to get a nice even layer. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>20 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>10 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six to eight</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the poached pears</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>500ml water</li>
        <li>300g caster sugar</li>
        <li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>1 wide strip lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 wide strip orange zest</li>
        <li>1 star anise</li>
        <li>2.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled</li>
        <li>4 William or conference pears</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the trifle</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>6 ready-made trifle sponges or savoiardi biscuits</li>
        <li>200ml sherry, dry ideally</li>
        <li>300ml vanilla custard, home-made ideally</li>
        <li>300ml double cream</li>
        <li>Caster sugar, to taste</li>
        <li>50g flaked almonds, toasted</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>First, poach the pears. Put all the ingredients (apart from the pears) into a saucepan and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li> Reduce to a simmer and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to infuse while it cools. This can be kept in the fridge until you need it.</li>
        <li>Peel and carefully core each pear, leaving them whole and ideally with the stalks on. Lay them in a pan, along with the stock syrup.</li>
        <li> Cover with a circle of parchment paper and sit a plate (smaller than the circumference of the pan) on top – this keeps the pears in the syrup while they cook.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil then turn down to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, or a little less if the pears are really ripe – check them with the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat and allow to cool in the syrup, then slice.</li>
        <li>Line the base of a large (ideally see-through) bowl with the sponge fingers or biscuits.</li>
        <li>Top with a layer of sliced pears to cover then sprinkle over the sherry to soak through both layers. Pour the custard over the pears.</li>
        <li>Whip the cream with a touch of sugar to taste, until you have medium to firm peaks.</li>
        <li>Pipe or spoon the cream over the trifle then use a fork to whip up the surface of the cream into peaks. Scatter with the almonds to finish.</li>
        <li> Serve immediately or leave in the fridge until ready to serve.</li>
      </ol>
