      <h1>Congress feels heat to act on youth vaping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:00:20+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/jessie-hellmann" target="_blank">Jessie Hellmann</a></address>
      <p>Pressure is building on Congress to act on rising youth vaping rates amid inaction from <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>House Democrats plan to pass a bill by year’s end that would ban flavored e-cigarette products they say helped to spark a teen vaping epidemic. </p>
      <p>Democrats found themselves in rare agreement with Trump when he vowed to clear the market of those products two months ago, but he has since backed off after facing a backlash from vapers, conservative groups and the industry. </p>
      <p>“This White House has been co-opted by the tobacco industry,” Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donna-shalala">Donna Shalala</a> (D-Fla.), the co-sponsor of the bill, told The Hill on Tuesday. </p>
      <p>“We’re going to pass a comprehensive bill. We’re not going to compromise,” said Shalala, who served as secretary of the Health and Human Services Department during the Clinton administration. </p>
      <p>Passing such a bill is likely to be a challenge — particularly in a divided Congress consumed by impeachment.</p>
      <p>Shalala’s bill, which passed out of a key committee Tuesday and will get a vote on the House floor by the end of the year, would ban flavors in tobacco products, including e-cigarettes; raise the tobacco-purchasing age to 21; and ban all online tobacco sales.</p>
      <p>Advocates are hopeful the measure, or portions of it, will make it into a year-end spending bill — which itself is the subject of pained negotiations between Democrats and Republicans.</p>
      <p>If the bill does get out of the House, it faces an uncertain path in the Senate, where the Republican majority typically eschews government regulation.</p>
      <p>Senate Majority Leader <a href="https://thehill.com/people/mitch-mcconnell">Mitch McConnell</a> (R-Ky.) has offered legislation that would raise the tobacco purchasing age to 21— a proposal Trump has also suggested. </p>
      <p>Asked whether Congress should pursue a flavors ban, McConnell declined to answer. </p>
      <p>“I’m going to focus … on raising the age to 21. That’s something everybody could agree on, something we ought to accomplish quickly,” he said. </p>
      <p>Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/john-cornyn">John Cornyn</a> (R-Texas) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/dianne-feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a> (D-Calif.) have offered legislation to require age verification for all online purchases of e-cigarettes. It would also require that an adult with an ID sign for the delivery. </p>
      <p>A Cornyn aide told The Hill he plans to push for Senate passage of the bill “soon.” A similar measure sponsored by Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rosa-delauro">Rosa DeLauro</a> (D-Conn.) passed the House last month. </p>
      <p>The percentage of teenagers who are vaping has doubled in the past two years, according to data released in September. </p>
      <p>An estimated 27.5 percent of high school students, and 10.5 percent of middle school students, said they had used e-cigarettes in the past month, according to one of the studies conducted by government researchers.</p>
      <p>Anti-tobacco advocates like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids have pushed both the Trump administration and Congress to ban flavors to curb youth vaping rates. </p>
      <p>But they’ve run into opposition from conservative free-market groups, industry and pro-vaping advocates. </p>
      <p>Reporting from The New York Times and other outlets suggests Trump was swayed by the #ivapeivote campaign, in which vapers said they would not vote for the president in 2020 if he pursued a flavor ban. </p>
      <p>But members of Congress acknowledge there is more they could be doing to curb youth vaping rates. </p>
      <p>“They said two months ago they were going to do something about the flavors,” DeLauro told The Hill Tuesday. </p>
      <p>“This is a public health crisis, and we will take a look at what it is that we can do.”</p>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/willard-mitt-romney">Mitt Romney</a> (R-Utah), who is sponsoring a Senate bill to ban flavored e-cigarettes, asked last week:, “Why haven’t we done anything about flavors?”</p>
      <p>“If it were to pass, my presumption is we’d have a dramatic impact on reducing the number of kids that get addicted to nicotine,” he added. </p>
      <p>“We are looking for every vehicle we can to get a ban on vaping flavors,” Romney told The Hill on Monday.</p>
