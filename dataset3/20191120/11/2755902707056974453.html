      <p>A 27-year-old woman was left with a broken leg by the police in Harare  CBD earlier on today.  The woman who identified herself only as Barbara told iHarare that she was only passing through the CBD and she was on her way to visit her younger sister in Nyabira.</p>
      <p>She narrated that she was unaware that there was going to be an address by opposition leader Nelson Chamisa. Unfortunately, she happened to be walking at the time the police went on a rampage. She was stopped by the police harassed and beaten so severely that she was left with a dislocated knee cap.</p>
      <p>When iHarare left the scened, Barbara was yet to receive any medical attention.</p>
