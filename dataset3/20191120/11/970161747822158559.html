      <p>A mother who gave birth to premature twin boys praised their ‘miracle’ bond after the stronger one helped save his weaker brother’s life with a cuddle.</p>
      <p>Hannah Zimunya, 28, was told to prepare for the worst when she went into labour more than three months early.</p>
      <p>Twins Dylan and Deiniol weighed just 2lbs and 1lbs 9oz when they were delivered at Maelor Hospital in Wrexham.</p>
      <p>The brothers were so tiny their lungs hadn’t fully developed yet and they were rushed straight to the specialist neonatal unit at the Royal Bolton Hospital.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-five Hannah and husband Xavi, 40, were then forced to leave little Deiniol 60 miles away when Dylan’s condition improved and they were allowed to take him home.</p>
      <p>However, when doctors organised for Dylan to see his poorly twin to say goodbye, Hannah says Deiniol’s condition miraculously started to improve within hours of them cuddling up together inside an incubator.</p>

      <p>‘When we took Dylan back to Bolton they were put together in the same incubator for a cuddle for a few minutes,’ Hannah said.</p>

      <p>‘It wasn’t until I phoned later that night to ask how Deiniol was doing that they told me his oxygen support had been halved.</p>
      <p>‘It was incredible, somehow Dylan, by just being there, managed to help Deiniol – he made him better.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Within two days Deiniol was taken off his ventilator completely, it really was a miracle.</p>
      <p>‘He saved his life with a cuddle, it was brilliant to watch and it showed all of us that they should never have been separated.</p>
      <p>‘That bond between twins really does exist.’</p>
      <p>After two months under the same roof in Bolton, Dylan was discharged in January before his brother followed him in April this year.</p>
      <p>Now both boys are back home and enjoying family life with their older siblings, TJ, eight, Lily, six, and Thandi, three, who helped to mark their incredible milestone first birthday at a big party last month.</p>

      <p>Today Deiniol is still receiving round-the-clock oxygen at home, but his dose has been reduced.</p>
      <p>Hannah said: ‘Just getting Deiniol home in the first place was amazing, because he was in hospital for seven months whereas we brought Dylan home after four.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t explain how happy I am both boys have celebrated their first birthdays, because there was a time where we didn’t know if both of them would get the chance to.</p>
      <p>‘It was the scariest time we have been through.’</p>

      <p>She thanked the staff at both hospitals, saying she ‘wouldn’t have got through everything’ without their support.</p>
      <p>Cath Bainbridge, Matron of Royal Bolton Hospital’s Neonatal Unit, said: ‘Every day we care for very premature and sometimes very poorly babies, and their families, and we try to care for each of them as if they were our own.</p>
      <p>‘If there is something we can do for a family that can make their experience more hopeful, we try to do all in our power to make it happen. In the case of these two beautiful little boys it was beyond doubt the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>‘All the team wish them a very happy first birthday, and many more to come.’</p>
