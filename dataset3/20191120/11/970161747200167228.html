      <p>Fans were not ok with that however, and demand from them led to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/rick-morty-season-4-uk-release-date-moved-next-week-fan-demand-11079687/">season 4’s new November premiere</a>.</p>
      <p>Ian Katz, Director of Programmes at Channel 4 said: ‘When we announced we would be airing Rick and Morty Series 4 on free to air TV in January we thought fans would be delighted.</p>
      <p>‘Instead they told us – in their droves – that it wasn’t nearly soon enough, so we’ve listened and brought forward the UK premiere to November 20th on E4 and All 4. Enjoy!’</p>
