      <p>Cape Town - The award-winning singer recently got candid about her dating life and whether or not she’d consider remarrying.</p>
      <p>Following the death of her husband, René Angélil, in 2016 from cancer, the <i>My Heart Will Go On</i> singer faced numerous rumours of having a special new man in her life.</p>
      <p>But in a recent interview, the 51-year-old gave the best response to the rumours surrounding her love life, <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094768/celine-dion-has-the-best-response-for-all-of-those-relationship-rumors"><b>E! News</b></a> reported.</p>
      <p>During an interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zosJxbl2aY"><b>What Happens Live</b></a> with show host Andy Cohen, the Canadian singer was asked by a fan if she’d started dating again.</p>
      <p>"I don't date. I don't have a boyfriend. And, you know, it doesn't mean that I won’t find someone in my life. If I do, that will be great. If I don't, that will be great."</p>
      <p>While the mother of three, according to <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/19/celine-dion-still-in-love-with-late-husband/"><b>Page Six</b></a>, admitted to still being in love with her late hubby, she also revealed to Andy that the public would be the first to know once she was back on the dating scene.</p>
      <p>"If I would have someone in my life, I’d tell you because I've been an open book all my life," she said, and added, "But if I do, I'll come back and I'll talk to you about it."</p>
