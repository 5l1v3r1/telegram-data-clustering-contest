      <p>A Bill to regulate the use of social media by Nigerians on Wednesday scaled second reading in Senate.</p>
      <p>The controversial Bill titled: “A Bill for an Act to make provisions for the protection from internet falsehood and manipulations and for related matters, 2019,” was sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, representing Niger East.</p>
      <p>In his debate, Senator Musa, said it has become imperative to curb the excesses of those using the social media to cause disaffection and assassination of character through fake news.</p>
      <p>“The hoax about the death of President Muhammadu Buhari in London and his replacement with Jibril from Sudan was a great threat to the peace and security of this country,” Musa said.</p>

      <p>Senators Ibrahim Gobir, Ishaku Clifford Elisha Abbo, Abba Moro and Bala Ibn Na’Allah supported the Bill.</p>
      <p>However, only Senator Chimaroke Nnamani (Enugu East), strongly opposed the Bill.</p>
      <p>When the Bill was put to voice vote by Senate President Ahmad Lawan, Senators approved it for second reading.</p>
      <p>Lawan referred the Bill to the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters for further legislative work.</p>
