      <p>Dom Sibley will open the batting for England in the first Test against New Zealand, while Sam Curran has been given the nod ahead of Chris Woakes.</p>
      <p>The opening clash of the two-match series begins in Mount Maunganui on Thursday, with debutant Sibley joining Rory Burns at the top of the order.</p>
      <p>Curran has been preferred to fellow all-rounder Woakes in a line-up unchanged from the three-day warm-up fixture with New Zealand A.</p>
      <p>Warwickshire star Sibley scored 14 in that match, in which England batted for only one innings and settled for a draw.</p>
