      <h3>PHILIPPINE National Police Officer-in-Charge Lieutenant General Archie Francisco F. Gamboa yesterday ordered all police units nationwide to fully enforce the ban on the use of vapes, accost all violators and seize their electronic cigarette gadget. The ban also applies at all police camps and stations across the country.</h3>
      <p>“In compliance with the order of the President, Gen. Gamboa has directed, effective today, all police units nationwide to enforce the ban on use of vapes; ensure that all violators will be arrested and properly recorded in the police blotters; confiscated items are accounted for and disposed of properly; and coordinate with local government units and agencies, vape stores and owners to enhance the enforcement of the ban,” said PNP spokesman Brigadier General Bernard M. Banac.</p>
      <p>The PNP spokesperson also said that all PNP personnel have been directed to retrain from using vapes or risk disciplinary sanctions.</p>
      <p>“All heads of offices and chiefs of police units in all levels are held accountable for the strict enforcement and compliance of their personnel with the ban. All PNP camps and offices are declared ‘No Vape Zone’,” Banac added.</p>
      <p>According to the official, they are urging all vape users to stop using vapes.</p>
      <p>The latest instruction of President Duterte is in relation to Executive Order No. 26 series of 2017 which provides for the establishment of smoke-free environments in public and enclosed places.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, President Duterte ordered law enforcers to arrest anyone vaping in public as he announced a ban on its use and importation, days after health authorities confirmed a case of electronic cigarette-associated lung injury.</p>
      <p>The Philippines banned smoking in public in 2003 and Duterte issued an executive order reinforcing the Tobacco Regulation Law in 2017. Smoking is allowed in certain smoking rooms.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health earlier sought a ban on vaping, warning the public that e-cigarettes are not a proven nicotine replacement therapy and can cause lung disease. According to the DOH, about one million Filipinos are using e-cigarettes.</p>
