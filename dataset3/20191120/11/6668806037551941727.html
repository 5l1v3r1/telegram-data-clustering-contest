Just few days after the massive announcement was made, rumours of Akshay striking up a three film deal with the production house began doing rounds. However, it now seems that there was never any truth behind these rumours.</p>

      <p>In an interview with a leading daily, a source outright denied the existence about any deal of Akshay and YRF claiming that the actor will only collaborate for stand alone projects. He said, “There is no such deal. Yash Raj Films and Akshay Kumar have a deal for just one project which is Prithviraj. There is no three film deal between the two. “Though there is no three film deal between Akshay and YRF, the two could very well collaborate with each other for any future venture on a standalone basis.”<br/><br/>Akshay Kumar will be returning to the big screen with Good Newwz. Along with Akshay, the film also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani in lead. Good Newwz is helmed by debutant director Raj Mehta and will be hitting the screens on 27 December this year.</p>
