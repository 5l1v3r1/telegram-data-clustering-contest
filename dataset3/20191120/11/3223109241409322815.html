      <h1>Do These 3 People Really Not Recognize Tom Hanks?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:58:33+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/stephanie_m/" target="_blank">Stephanie Mlot</a></address>
      <p>I am outraged.</p>
      <p>America’s sweetheart Tom Hanks was apparently snubbed by all three <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/alex-trebek-contractually-obligated-to-beat-cancer-1777459/"><i>Jeopardy!</i></a> players Monday night.</p>
      <p>Tom. Freaking. Hanks.</p>
      <p>The man whose unmistakable face has graced the posters for nearly 50 films.</p>
      <p>Whose <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/a-league-of-his-own-tom-hanks-american-icon-244988/">“goofy-looking nose, ears that hang down, [and] eyes that make me look like I’m part Chinese”</a> are unmistakable—even with a curiously groomed facial hair.</p>
      <p>Whose tender features (and charming personality) make him the ideal actor to portray musician, puppeteer, minister, and beloved children’s TV host Fred Rogers.</p>
      <p>Yet, when a trio of <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/jeopardy-player-wagers-big-on-heartfelt-message-1810301/">game show contestants</a> watched Tom Hanks in a clip from the upcoming <i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i> Mr. Rogers biopic, not a one seemed to recognize him.</p>

      <p>Andrew Thomson, Beverly Randez, and Kevin Jones all stared blankly at Alex Trebek, who no doubt was screaming inside.</p>
      <p>As of Wednesday morning, the 15-second video had more than 300,000 views on Twitter, where filmmaker Eric Marsh shared the atrocity.</p>
      <p>“This is the most f***ed up thing I’ve ever seen,” he wrote on Tuesday, attracting equally aggrieved responses.</p>

      <p>You can put down the torches and pitchforks, though.</p>
      <p>According to a <i>Jeopardy!</i> fan account, the studio lights signaling it’s time to answer never turned on for the <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/jeopardy-apparently-bans-wagers-alluding-to-sex-nazis-satan-1784905/">contestants</a>.</p>
      <p>So this was all (hopefully) just a simple misunderstanding.</p>
      <p>“It has been reported by audience members from this game that the lights on the signaling system malfunctions and the contestants were unable to buzz in,” Andy Saunders, who runs The <i>Jeopardy!</i> Fan blog, <a href="https://thejeopardyfan.com/2019/11/final-jeopardy-11-18-2019.html">wrote on Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>The game was reportedly paused while judges deliberated; it was ruled as “no harm, no foul,” and the competition continued without a clue replacement.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately it looks like none of them new Tom Hanks,” user jmt613 wrote in a <i>Jeopardy!</i> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeopardy/comments/dy51yv/jeopardy_recap_for_mon_nov_18/f7yv7i4">subreddit</a>. “But really they just weren’t able to buzz in because the lights did not flash.”</p>
      <p><i>A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood</i>—starring an unidentifiable actor named Tom Hanks—is scheduled to hit U.S. cinemas this Friday.</p>
