      <p>Around 50-60 students from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Wednesday shouted slogans outside the new Delhi Police headquarters demanding an apology from the commissioner against the alleged lathicharge on blind students.</p>
      <p>The protest was an escalation to the ongoing demonstrations for the demand of fee hike's rollback.</p>
      <p>Most protestors were students with disabilities from JNU, angry at the police action.</p>
      <p>"Most students belong to marginalised families with low income. I could study further only due to subsidised education. Inclusive education should be for all. How will we study further with hike in fee?" asked Pankaj Khushwaha, who is pursuing PhD.</p>
      <p>A delegation led by the PhD student went inside the police headquarters to submit a list of demands.</p>

      <p>"Police lathicharged a blind student and asked why he is participating in a protest if he is blind. Protest is a democratic right for all. We demand an unconditional apology from the police commissioner," said a student of Russian studies.</p>
      <p>Shweta, JNU MPhil Society Medicine and Community Health, asked, "Our bigger issue is against fee-hike. Plus, on Monday we faced brutal behaviour by the police. Why were students lathicharged?"</p>
