      <p>AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch technology company Prosus NV (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/PRX.AS">PRX.AS</a>) on Wednesday urged shareholders of Britain’s Just Eat PLC (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/JE.L">JE.L</a>) to accept its unsolicited 4.9 billion pound ($6.3 billion) cash bid for the company by Dec. 10, and spurn an alternative offer as too risky.</p>
      <p>“We believe that the Takeaway.com offer underestimates the substantial investment required in Just Eat to recapture market share and improve performance,” Prosus CEO Bob van Dijk said in a statement of the rival proposal.</p>
      <p>Takeaway’s all-share offer, which is supported by Just Eat’s board, currently values Just Eat at around 4.7 billion pounds.</p>
      <p>Prosus is controlled by South Africa’s Naspers (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/NPNJn.J">NPNJn.J</a>) Ltd.</p>
