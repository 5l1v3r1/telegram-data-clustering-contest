      <p>The cavolo nero used in this tortellini has a wintry flavour that is delicious with nutmeg, garlic and chilli, but you could use spinach, kale or any other leafy greens. I recommend you use a pasta machine for this, in order to get the dough rolled out to the right thickness.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>40 minutes, plus 30 minutes chilling time | <b>Cooking time:</b> 15 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four to six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>300g “00” pasta flour, plus a little extra if needed when rolling out</li>
        <li>4 medium free-range eggs</li>
        <li>300g cavolo nero, stalks removed</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for cooking</li>
        <li>Pinch of dried chilli</li>
        <li>Pinch of chopped garlic</li>
        <li>200g ricotta</li>
        <li>100g parmesan, grated, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>Touch of freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>Semolina, for dusting</li>
        <li>A little butter, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>For the pasta dough, tip the flour on to a work surface and make a well in the middle. Mix together three of the eggs (the fourth will be used for an egg wash later) and pour two thirds of this into the well, reserving the rest.</li>
        <li>Starting from the outside, work the flour into the liquid until it forms a dough. Knead until the dough is smooth, firm and elastic (this will take five to 10 minutes). You may need to add more egg mixture if the dough doesn’t come together.</li>
        <li>Wrap the dough in cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. You can make this the day before and leave in the fridge wrapped in cling film and foil.</li>
        <li> Cook the cavolo nero in a pan of boiling water until soft – about four minutes – then drain well and allow to cool. Once cold, squeeze out the excess moisture from the leaves, then chop finely and place in a bowl.</li>
        <li> In a pan, sauté the chilli and garlic with a splash of olive oil until soft but not coloured, and then add the cavolo nero and toss through. Take off the heat and allow to cool, then place in a bowl with the ricotta, parmesan and nutmeg. Mix well.</li>
        <li> To make the tortellini, halve the dough and use a rolling pin to flatten one piece to the widest setting of your pasta machine. Starting at the widest setting, run the pasta dough through twice. Reduce the setting by one notch and run it through twice again. If the dough feels sticky, add a little flour, but not enough to dry it out.</li>
        <li>Run it through the machine twice on each notch until you get to the narrowest notch. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
        <li>Using a serrated pastry wheel, cut the dough into long strips about 10cm wide.</li>
        <li>Put a heaped teaspoon of filling at intervals along the strip, about 2.5cm apart and about a third of the way from the long side of the strip nearest to you. Brush in between each mound of filling with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Fold over the side of pasta nearest to you. Carefully press down around each mound to get the air out. Brush the top third of the strip with egg wash and fold it back down over the mounds, again pressing down with your cupped hand.</li>
        <li> Using a serrated pastry wheel, cut out the tortellini and squeeze the edges gently to seal.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining rolled out dough and filling and leave on a tray dusted with semolina.</li>
        <li> To cook, boil the tortellini in salted water for three minutes until they rise to the surface. Drain and serve immediately, tossed with a little butter and parmesan.</li>
