      <h1>OnePlus 8 Pro sketches confirm quad-cams and punch-hole display</h1>
      <h2>But not much else appears to have changed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:49:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2353/carly-page" target="_blank">Carly Page</a></address>
      <p><b>ALLEGED SKETCHES </b>of the OnePlus 8 Pro have surfaced online, all-but-confirming the flagship's quad-camera setup and punch-hole display. </p>
      <p>The diagrams, obtained by <a href="https://true-tech.net/oneplus/exclusive-oneplus-8-pro-product-diagram-leaks-showing-four-camera-sensors/"><i>True-Tech</i></a>, show four camera lenses on the back of the handset, accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash and laser autofocus. The fourth lens is expected to arrive in the form of a depth-sensing Time of Flight (ToF) sensor.</p>

        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/7a65ed17-1ba3-4e1a-975c-26dae7102b32/1/OnePlus8Prosketch-600x334.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The bare-bones drawings also add weight to the rumours that OnePlus is planning to ditch the pop-up camera mechanism seen on the OnePlus 7 Pro. Instead, the firm looks to be considering a Samsung-esque punch-hole cutout, with the sketches depicting handsets with both single and dual-lens front-facing cameras. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, not much seems to have changed; the button placements remain identical, with a volume controls positioned on the left of the screen and the alert slider and power button placed on the right-hand side.</p>
      <p><b>12/11/19: </b>In-the-wild images of an alleged OnePlus 8 Pro have surfaced online, adding weight to the rumours of a punch-hole display.</p>
      <p>Official-looking renders had previously suggested that OnePlus planned to bin notches and pop-up cameras in favour of a punch-hole display, and images of a supposed OnePlus 8 Pro prototype (below) all but confirms it. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/O_s_c_a_r_o/status/1192941931308945413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>They show a OnePlus handset sporting a pill-shaped punch-hole cutout that houses two selfie cameras instead of one. </p>
      <p>The blurry snaps also tell us that the OnePlus 8 Pro will be available in a purple variant, similar to that seen on the year-old OnePlus 6T in Thunder Purple, and suggest it'll sport a curved screen similar to that seen on this year's 7T Pro. </p>
      <p>5G support could also be on the cards for the next-gen OnePlus; the images allegedly show "OnePlus 8 Pro 5G" branding on the handset's backside. </p>
      <p><b>THE ONEPLUS 8 PRO </b>will reportedly up the ante in the screen stakes with an iPhone 12-rivalling 120Hz display.</p>
      <p>So says tipster Max J, who tweeted a not-so-cryptic image that mentions '120Hz" alongside the tagline "Be a Pro" (<i>below</i>). While many speculated that he was teasing the incoming <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3082313/Galaxy%20S11%20tipped%20to%20sport%20second-gen%20108MP%20camera%20sensor">Galaxy S11</a>, Max later confirmed that he was referring to the OnePlus 8 Pro.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Samsung_News_/status/1192536068798787585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>The tweet doesn't give anything else away, but the accompanying "Be a Pro" message suggests this feature - which will presumably arrive in the form of a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED display - will be reserved for OnePlus' next-gen Pro-branded model, with the standard OnePlus 8 likely to stick to a 90Hz screen.</p>
      <p>If the rumour is legit, the OnePlus 8 Pro will be the Chinese firm's first phone to sport a 120Hz screen - though not the first to make it to market; the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3079306/asus-rog-phone-2-uk-release">Asus RoG Phone 2, which debuted in Europe in September</a>, sports a 120Hz OLED display.</p>
      <p>Apple is reportedly plotting 120Hz screens for next year's iPhone lineup too. Recent rumours suggested the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3065654/iphone-12-release-date-price-specs-increase-in-costs-rumour-5g">iPhone 12</a> will follow in the footsteps of Apple's ProMotion iPad Pros with a 120Hz screen, a significant upgrade over the iPhones' current 60Hz displays. </p>
      <p><b>5/11/19: </b>OnePlus is reportedly planning to show off its first wearable alongside the OnePlus 8.</p>
      <p>After its recent foray into the television space, the company is now gearing up to launch a "fitness wearable", according to a tweet from <i>TechPP</i> writer Tech Auntyji (<i>below</i>). </p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/techauntyji/status/1190606119145623553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>The cryptic tweet doesn't tell us much else about the gadget, but its description as a "fitness wearable" suggests it'll arrive as a Fitbit-band style device, rather than an Apple Watch competitor. And given OnePlus' association with Google, the unnamed wearable will likely arrive running Wear OS. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/dc8c5aa1-6ad4-4c7f-b1c5-4881ea532a16/2/fill/OnePlusWatchOld-600x334.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p><i><a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/OnePlus-watch-release-date_id120145">PhoneArena</a>, </i>which has shared early sketches of the so-called OnePlus Watch that the company abandoned in 2016 (<i>above</i>), claims the device will launch alongside the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro, which are expected to debut in May 2020. </p>
      <p><b>18/10/19: </b>We've already caught<b> </b>a glimpse of the OnePlus 8, and now the Pro variant has prematurely surfaced.</p>
      <p>The official-looking images (<i>above</i>), shared by OnLeaks and <i><a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-pro-renders-images-quad-cameras-punch-hole-display-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a></i>, show that the OnePlus 8 Pro will ditch the 7T's waterdrop notch and <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3082416/oneplus-7t-pro-review">7T Pro</a>'s pop-up camera in favour of a Samsung-style punch-hole cutout in the top left corner of its display.</p>
      <p>As per <i>91Mobiles</i>, this screen will measure in at 6.65in, larger than the 6.5in screen size tipped for the standard OnePlus 8, and it'll unsurprisingly feature a 90Hz refresh rate. </p>
      <p>The renders also suggest that the 8 Pro will be the first OnePlus smartphone to sport a quad-camera setup, comprising three sensors (main, telephoto and wide-angle) alongside a 3D Time of Flight (ToF) sensor. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the OnePlus 8 Pro will sport a USB-C port flanked by a redesigned speaker grille, 8GB RAM paired with 128GB storage, and possible 5G support. As per the render, it looks like the device will also be made available in a new mirrored silver finish. </p>

      <p><b>7/10/19: </b>We're still days away from the launch of the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/3080034/oneplus-7t-release-date-price-uk-release-12-october-official">OnePlus 7T Pro</a>, but that hasn't stopped its sequel from appearing online.</p>
      <p>That's thanks to <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-8-design-revealed-in-renders-punch-hole-display-triple-rear-cameras-and-more/">OnLeaks and <i>CashKaro</i></a>, which have joined forces to share images of what they claim are renders of the OnePlus 8 based on schematics from a "company insider." </p>
      <p>The renders show a handset that looks a lot like the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3075664/oneplus-7-pro-review">OnePlus 7 Pro</a>; there's an almost bezel-free curved display, three cameras positioned vertically on the rear of the device and a familiar blue colour scheme. </p>
      <p>However, unlike the 7 Pro, the renders show that the OnePlus 8 will adopt a punch-hole camera in the top left corner of its 6.5in screen, rather than the pop-up camera of its predecessor.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/553f7888-fe0e-4e37-bebb-0e26b19dae17/2/OnePlus8-600x334.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It'll also feature some changes under the hood, as the leak claims the OnePlus 8 will be the company's first phone to ship with wireless charging. OnePlus has long opted against including this feature, claiming that wireless charging is "inferior" compared to traditional methods.</p>
      <p>Given OnePlus' previous comments, it's likely upgraded components are also on the cards; OnLeaks and <i>CashKaro</i> speculate that the OnePlus 8 flagship would be powered by the upcoming Snapdragon 865 SoC, which will be teamed with up to 12GB RAM and 128GB of non-expandable storage. </p>
      <p>5G support will also be included, according to the leak, though this will likely be included only on the OnePlus 8 Pro. </p>
      <p>It'll likely be a while until the OnePlus 8 and 8 Pro make their official debut, as the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro were unveiled in May this year.</p>
      <p>Still, you won't have to wait that long until a new OnePlus device is unveiled. Following the recent unveiling of the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3081974/oneplus-7t-review">OnePlus 7T</a>, the firm will show off the OnePlus 7T Pro at an event in London on 10 October. This is expected to feature a pop-up selfie cam, triple cameras and an upgraded Snapdragon 855+ CPU. µ</p>
