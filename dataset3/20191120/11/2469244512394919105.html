      <p>The post also touches on Harvey's numerous telly appearances which led to him becoming the subject of vile social media posts.</p>
      <p>It reads: "Harvey deals with online bullying and trolling. He was subject to horrendous online abuse after sharing a drawing of his mum on the Gatwick Express on his  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a>  page.</p>
      <p>"Fans commented pleaded with Katie to remove the account to protect Harvey, but she chose not to and instead deleted the harmful comments.</p>
      <p>"On 22 January 2019, it was revealed that Parliament would back Katie’s ‘Harvey’s Law’ efforts.</p>

      <p>"She started an online petition in March 2017 to criminalise social media trolling, after Harvey suffered at the hands of Instagram trolls."</p>
      <p>Last month, Harvey's straight-talking businesswoman mum named and shamed a troll who called her son a "fat s**t" and Katie a "s**g."</p>
      <p>The former glamour model shared with her fans a screen shot of the troll's profile which showed they were a health and social care nursing consultant.</p>
      <p>Katie penned: "If anybody knows this person or works with this person, I would question her job."</p>
      <p>She added an appeal to fans: "This is exactly what she said about my son Harvey. Name and shame her."</p>
      <p>Recently Katie made another swipe at trolls as she filmed Harvey asking them to not target him.</p>
      <p>In his hand, Harvey can be seen clutching a piece of paper with the slogan: "Give Us A Break! Bullying is WRONG. End of."</p>
