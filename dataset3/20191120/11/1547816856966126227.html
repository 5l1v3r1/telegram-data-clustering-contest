      <p>With each passing day, Bigg Boss 13 house is turning into a battlefield and at the same time is equally very entertaining. A <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-sidharth-shukla-asim-riaz-turn-enemies-stay-strong-sid-shukla-and-we-stand-by-asim-trends/5dd4d07687fb571eff7e4215">physical broil between once upon a time besties Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz</a>, just set the temperature in the house soaring.  Fortunately adding relief to this intense show is Bigg Boss’ next task, that gave comic relief to the audience. Promo of the upcoming episode has Hindustani Bhau, Rashami Desai, and Shehnaaz Gill roped in for the task, where these three are possibly a family wanting to marry their girl to a suitable boy. <br/><br/>While Hindustan Bhau plays the landlord, Rashami plays his wife and Shehnaaz is their daughter. Here their notorious daughter portrayed by Shehnaaz is making cheeky demands in front of her father, desiring to have two husbands, followed by going on a honeymoon before her marriage. Shehnaaz is fun to watch and Rashami adds the right amount of spice. While we know the rapport she shares with Paras Chhabra and Sidharth Shukla, Rashami jokingly says it would be better if she dies a widow.
