      <p>More than two million people have applied to register to vote since the General Election was announced, according to Government figures.</p>
      <p>A total of 2,048,039 applications were submitted between October 29 – the day the Government called for an election on December 12 – and November 19.</p>
      <p>More than a third of applications (35%) came from people under the age of 25.</p>
      <p>A further 30% were from 25 to 34-year-olds.</p>
      <p>By contrast, just 5% came those aged 65 and over.</p>

      <p>Time is running out to register to vote in the election.</p>
      <p>Applications must be submitted by 11.59pm on Tuesday November 26.</p>
      <p>An increase in applications is not direct evidence of an increase in the number of people able to vote.</p>
      <p>At previous elections there have been applications from people below the legal age to vote or who are already on the electoral register.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless the volume of applications suggests a growing interest in participating in the election.</p>

      <p>Figures published by the Electoral Commission this week show that an estimated 25% of black voters in Great Britain are currently not registered to vote, along with 24% of Asian voters and 31% of people with mixed ethnicity.</p>
      <p>This compares with a nationwide average of 17% who are not registered.</p>
      <p>Craig Westwood, director of communications, policy and research at the Electoral Commission, said: “Everyone eligible to vote should be able to do so. It only takes five minutes to register to vote online – time that you might otherwise spend waiting for the kettle to boil or for a bus to arrive. So if you want to make sure your voice is heard, go online and register now.”</p>
      <p>To be able to vote in the General Election on December 12, a person must be registered to vote, aged 18 or over on polling day, and also be either a UK or Irish citizen or a qualifying Commonwealth citizen resident in the UK.</p>
      <p>Applications to register to vote can be made online at gov.uk/register-to-vote</p>
