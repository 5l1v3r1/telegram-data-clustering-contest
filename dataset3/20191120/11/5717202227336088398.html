      <h1>Gabriel Martinelli hails Brazilian-esque Arsenal teammate Joe Willock</h1>

      <p>Gabriel Martinelli has heaped praise on Arsenal teammate Joe Willock, who he says has a touch of the Brazilian about him.</p>
      <p>The young forward was speaking to the <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/news/willocks-style-similar-brazilian-way">club’s official website</a> for a Q&amp;A session.</p>
      <p>He said: “He has personality, he doesn’t keep his head down, he always drives forward. He takes the ball and tries to dribble one player, then another.</p>

      <p>“He doesn’t hide away in games. He’s always searching for the best options. I think his style is similar to the Brazilian way.”</p>
      <p>Willock has made an impression in 2019/20, making 15 appearances in all competitions so far.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old has become a trusted member of the first-team, with manager Unai Emery often preferring him to Mesut Ozil so far.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Technician Willock set for big future</h3>
      <p>Skilful Willock could certainly pass for being Brazilian in the way that he plays.</p>

      <p>The England U21 international seems very comfortable with the ball at his feet and likes to glide through the lines.</p>
      <p>The ‘Brazilian’ way is typified by showing flair on the ball, and Willock undoubtedly has that in his locker.</p>
      <p>Brazilians are also about an eye for the spectacular, something the 20-year-old demonstrated against Arsenal in the Carabao Cup</p>
