      <p>Students and staff at Stowmarket High School students held a colour run in memory of Charlotte Shields-Bayliss one year on from her tragic death at the age of just 29.</p>
      <p>The textiles teacher, known as Lottie, fell victim to peripartum cardiomyopathy, a rare type of heart failure that occurs during pregnancy or immediately after delivery of the baby.</p>
      <p>A year on, and the school wanted Lottie's memory to live on and celebrate her life by reflecting her fun and colourful personality in a jubilant colour run.</p>
      <p>On the final afternoon of half term more than 550 students and teachers ran a lap of the school field passing through colour stations where powder paint was hurled at them, creating an explosion of colour.</p>

      <p>There were also stalls, competitions, games and activities for others to participate in.</p>
      <p>Poignantly, a sudden downpour of rain saw a rainbow arc over the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Headteacher Dave Lee-Allan said: "Just like when we run our sponsored walk our students are always extraordinary, and so they were again.</p>

      <p>"Even when the weather turned the students were fantastic and I was so proud to see them having so much fun in aid of such a good cause.</p>
      <p>"The rainbow was stunning and one of Lottie Shields-Bayliss' closest colleagues whispered to me 'Lottie's here'. My goodness, that hit home."</p>
      <p>The colour run raised more than Â£1,500 towards <a href="https://www.cardiomyopathy.org/cardiomyopathy-information/cardiomyopathy-information">Cardiomyopathy UK</a>, and the school said it welcomed any further donations.</p>
      <p>The charity works to raise awareness of the condition and arrange support for those affected by it.</p>

      <p>It is a rare type of heart muscle disease which occurs during the last part of, or in the first few months after, pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The heart becomes enlarged and weakened and less able to pump blood than normal.</p>
      <p>Figures vary, but it is thought to affect around 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000 women, or 1 in every 2,000 women who give birth.</p>
      <p>Mrs Shields-Bayliss gave birth to Delilah - who is healthy - at West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds in September 2018 but succumbed to the condition in Papworth Hospital the following month.</p>
