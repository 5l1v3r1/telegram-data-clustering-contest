      <p>Nigerians are making waves in virtually every field. Simple Azenabor, a Nigerian based in Japan and an app developer, has created a Nigerian chat app called SoftTalk.</p>
      <p>According to Azenabor, who is also the founder of Prime Time Telecoms, a communication company in Japan, the chatting app will also allow users to send instant messages, videos, audios and files.</p>
      <p>The app was said to have launched on August 29, 2018 at a grand ceremony at EKO Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The messaging app works like the popular WhatsApp where signing up requires users’ mobile number and does not demand much data to start running.</p>

      <p>Azenabor told the media that what makes the app different from other messaging apps is that it is targeted at giving users a different experience than what is presently obtainable.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We do so much than messaging, we want to empower and improve on the way messaging is done today, by giving access to users to shop, while <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1250385-soft-bentley-benz-gucci-audio-lyrics-reactions.html">Soft</a> chatting and Soft talking at the same time.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"We work with reputable brands and companies in Japan to sell the SoftTalk vision,"</i> he said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that one of the Nigerians changing the country's stock narratives with their skills is Yinka Ilori who makes artsy <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1275197-yinka-ilori-london-based-nigerian-designer-using-colourful-ankara-prints-beautify-uk.html">decorations that incorporate Ankara fabrics</a>.</p>

      <p>In 2019 Ilori’s design was all over London in the summer even as the 32-year-old in an interview with the magazine said there is a lot to him than design.</p>

      <p>Born to Nigerian parents, he always aims to create a hybrid of British design with the loud Nigerian culture as he draws from the parables his parents had shared with him.</p>
