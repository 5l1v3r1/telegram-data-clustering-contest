      <h1>2020 Mini JCW GP is a 300HP monster hatch</h1>
      <h2>Mini unleashes limited-run John Cooper Works GP</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:21:00+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>09Two years ago, Mini unleashed what could be its most track-tuned machine called the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/2020-john-cooper-works-gp-to-be-fastest-mini-yet-with-over-300-hp.html">John Cooper Works (JCW) GP Concept</a>. A prelude for an upcoming production car, the concept build look menacing and appears ready to dominate on the track.</p>
      <p>Fast forward to 2019, and Mini has officially launched the production version of their most powerful hot hatch to date... and it's perfectly road legal.</p>

      <p>Designed to be more aerodynamic than the standard hatchbacks, Mini was busy modifying the body. It has a new chin spoiler up front, revised side skirts, an updated rear bumper design, and a more imposing front fascia. Like the original concept, a huge wing makes its home atop the Mini. It has a double wing contour design which helps in delivering more downforce. To further save on weight, 18-inch forged alloys sit on the wheel wells and each weigh only 9 kg. They are then wrapped in high performance tires that measure 225/35/R18.</p>
      <p>Also present on the Mini JCW GP are the carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) wheel arch trim. Lightweight and made from recycled materials used in making the BMW i3 and i8, these trim pieces help the car have better aerodynamics.</p>

      <p>Don't expect to find any rear seats on the JCW GP. That's right, Mini removed those in order to put a cross brace to make the Mini more rigid, as well as prevent luggage from slipping forward. However, Mini did not skimp on giving the two seats up front with high quality materials. Both are upholstered in Dinamica / leather combination with silver side edges and red accents. With only 3,000 set to be made, Mini made sure that each one has a corresponding number to remind owners of its exclusivity.</p>
      <p>To further make it stand out from the rest, Mini installed a 3D-printed steering wheel that is only specific for the JCW GP. It's wrapped in nappa leateher and comes with the same red accents that can be seen throughout the cabin. Complementing the unique steering wheel are 3D-printed paddle shifters that are made from metal.</p>

      <p>Pop the hood and out comes a 2.0-liter TwinPower Turbo inline-four. Now while it might have the same displacement as the standard JCW, Mini has boosted the engine to produce 306 horsepower at 5000 – 6250 rpm and 450 Nm of torque at 1750 – 4500 rpm. This was made possible thanks to a reinforced crankshaft, new pistons, bushless connecting rods, new turbocharger, improved fuel injection system, and an improved cooling system. With it, the JCW GP can sprint from 0 – 100 km/h in only 5.2 seconds and hit a top-speed of 265 km/h.</p>

      <p>Besides having a more powerful motor, the JCW GP also gets a new eight-speed automatic transmission that has been tailored for the hot hatch specifically. It also has a differential lock to match with the engine's increased torque output. A more powerful braking system has been installed as well and consists of 4-piston calipers at the front and a single-piston caliper at the rear. Finally, it has specially-tuned springs, dampers, and stabilizers which make it more than capable of handling the curves.</p>

      <p>Deliveries of the 3,000 units of the Mini JCW GP will begin in March 2020.</p>
