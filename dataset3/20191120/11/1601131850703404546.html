      <p>Your smartphone may not have a display nearly as big as the one on your phone, but that doesn’t mean it’s safe from scratches from day-to-day use. If you own a Galaxy Watch, a Gear Sport, or even the old Gear S2, you don’t want that beautiful design marred by a scratched display, and thankfully, there’s a whole market for glass protectors for these watches. OMOTON is one of the manufacturers of smartwatch glass protectors, and their pack of three laser-cut tempered screen protectors that fit the 42mm Galaxy Watch, the Gear Sport, and the Gear S3 is currently available at a 27% discount.</p>
