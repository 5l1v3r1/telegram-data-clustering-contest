      <h1>Ressa bid to drop cyberlibel suit rejected</h1>

      <h3>THE Manila regional trial court yesterday denied the demurrer to evidence by Rappler’s Maria Ressa in connection with the cyberlibel complaint filed against her by businessman Wilfredo Keng.</h3>
      <p>“The evidence for the prosecution is competent and sufficient to sustain the indictment for Violation of Section 4 (C)(4) of Republic Act 10175 against all the accused. It now behooves upon all the accused to adduce evidence to controvert those presented by the prosecution in a full-blown trial,” said Branch 46 Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa in a ruling.</p>
      <p>A demurrer to evidence is a pleading that the defense files after the prosecution’s presentation of evidence to seek an outright dismissal of the case. Had the demurrer been granted, Ressa would not have needed to present her own evidence as the case would be dismissed outright.</p>
      <p>Keng sued Rappler for cyber-libel over a May 2012 article that claimed he allowed former chief justice Renato Corona to use his SUV, and he was allegedly involved in human trafficking and drug smuggling.</p>
      <p>Citing the multiple publication rule, government prosecutors indicted Ressa, and former writer Reynaldo Santos Jr. because the article, though it was published in 2012, was republished on February 2014, hence punishable under the cyberlibel law.</p>
      <p>Ressa contested the Department of Justice’s resolution, saying that the law did not take effect until April 2014 when the SC decision upholding the law’s validity became final, and the restraining order was lifted.</p>
      <p>But the Manila RTC in a nine-page order stressed the TRO just suspended the “implementation and enforcement of RA 10175, so that crimes committed during the said period cannot be prosecuted” but it did not suspend its effectivity.</p>
