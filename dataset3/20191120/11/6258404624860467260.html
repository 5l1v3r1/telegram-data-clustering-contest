      <p>You can wait for the influx of <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/new-egg-black-friday-sale-is-packed-with-notebooks-and-tech">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday deals that are right around the corner , but if you are looking to build a new PC or upgrade an existing one right now, there are bargains to be had. One of them is for an <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/amd-ryzen-7-2700-and-ryzen-5-2600-review">AMD Ryzen 5 2600</a> processor. It's currently selling for 41 percent below its list price, and it comes with a bonus.<br/><br/>Over at Amazon, you can snag the <b><a href="https://amzn.to/2XwQdon">Ryzen 5 2600 for $117.68</a></b>. That's around $80 below the processor's list price, and still a chunk lower than its street pricing for most of September. It dropped to below $120 in October, and has stayed there ever since.<br/><br/>Some specs at a glance...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Architecture:</b> Zen+ (12nm FinFET)</li>
        <li><b>Cores:</b> 6</li>
        <li><b>Threads:</b> 12</li>
        <li><b>Base Clock:</b> 3.4GHz</li>
        <li><b>Max Boost Clock:</b> 3.9GHz</li>
        <li><b>L3 Cache:</b> 16MB</li>
        <li><b>TDP:</b> 65W</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is based on AMD's second generation Zen+ CPU architecture, so it's missing things like <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/gigabyte-pcie-40-ssd-teases-5gbs-ryzen-3000-zen-2-motherboards">PCI Express 4.0</a> support. However, you can still build a fast PC around this slice of silicon, at a great price.<br/><br/>The Ryzen 5 2600 comes bundled with AMD's Wraith Stealth cooler. You also get three months of <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/xbox-game-pass-for-windows-pc">Xbox Game Pass for PC</a> when buying this CPU. Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that is sort of like a Netflix for gamesâ€”subscribers have access to games such as Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, The Outer Worlds, Rage 2, Metro 2033 Redux, and other titles.<br/><br/>We'll be keeping a constant pulse check on vendors as Black Friday and Cyber Monday discounts become available.
