      <p><b>VALLETTA, Malta (AP)</b> - Authorities in Malta on Wednesday arrested a prominent Maltese businessman who appears to be a "person of interest" in the assassination of a leading investigative reporter.</p>
      <p>Yorgen Fenech was on a yacht intercepted on a northward course away from Malta by the Maltese military early Wednesday and forced back to port.</p>
      <p>In remarks to reporters, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat did not directly tie the arrest to the murder of 53-year-old Daphne Caruana Galizia in a powerful car bomb in October 2017.</p>
      <p>But he did say that it appeared to result from comments he made a day earlier on the possibility of a pardon for an alleged middleman who had offered to identify the mastermind of the killing.</p>
      <p>The slain journalist's three sons were more direct in their comments on Twitter, making a direct link between the arrest and their mother's assassination.</p>
      <p>Muscat said he instructed police to be on the lookout for unusual actions by "people of interest" in the long-unsolved murder, after announcing Tuesday that a pardon would be possible for the middleman if information he provided could stand up in court.</p>
      <p>"If I had not given these instructions, maybe today we might be speaking of persons of interest who might have escaped,'' Muscat told reporters.</p>
      <p>He declined to comment further out of concern that any comments might prejudice a case.</p>
      <p>The prime minister said that no politician is tied to Caruana Galizia's murder. However, tweets by Caruana Galizia's sons ties the arrested businessman directly to Muscat's chief of staff and a former energy minister.</p>
      <p>No details of charges against Fenech have been revealed, but authorities would have 48 hours to decide on them.</p>
      <p>Fenech is a very prominent hotelier and director of the Maltese power company. His name was on leaked documents as a source of income for companies named in the Panama papers.</p>
      <p>Caruana Galizia alleged on her blog eight months before her violent death that a company called 17 Black Ltd. was connected to Maltese politicians, but provided no specific evidence.</p>
      <p>That reporting was picked up by the Daphne Project after her murder. It reported in April 2018 that Malta's anti-money laundering watchdog had identified Fenech, the chief executive of a Maltese property developer, as the owner of 17 Black.</p>
      <p>The Daphne Project followed a paper trail to two Panama companies in the names of two people close to Muscat - his chief of staff and the former energy minister - that stood to receive payments from 17 Black for unspecified services. There is no evidence the payments went ahead.</p>
