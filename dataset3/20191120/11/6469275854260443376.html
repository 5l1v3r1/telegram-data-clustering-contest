        <b>Jose Mourinho has been appointed as the new head coach of Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Manchester United boss has replaced Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Here we recall some of his memorable comments from his time in charge at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>“Do you know what was the result? Three-nil. Do you know what this means (holding up three fingers)? Three-nil but it also means three Premier Leagues and I won more alone than the other 19 managers together. Three for me and two for them. Respect, respect, respect,” – leaving the post-match media conference angry at a perceived lack of respect following the August 27, 2018, 3-0 Premier League loss to Tottenham at Old Trafford.</p>

          <i>“You can be a rich club and buy all the best players in the world but you cannot buy class...because I am in the movie I could ask for some royalties,” – criticising neighbours Manchester City for their Amazon Prime documentary on August 18, 2018.</i>

      <p>“I wouldn’t spend my money to see these teams,” – after a weakened United lost 4-1 to a Liverpool side without their leading players in Michigan in the International Champions Cup on July 28, 2018.</p>

          <i>“What never happened to me and will never happen to me is to be suspended for match-fixing,” – a war of words with Antonio Conte escalated in January 2018 when the Portuguese made reference to the Italian’s four-month ban for failing to report attempted match-fixing, which was later overturned and saw Conte acquitted.</i>

      <p>“If you ask me one thing that I don’t like a lot it’s that they lose their balance very easily. You know, a little bit of wind and they fall,” – accuses Manchester City of simulation on December 9, 2017, ahead of the Manchester derby.</p>

          <i>“I’m not going to lose my hair to speak about Antonio Conte,” – makes a reference to then-Chelsea boss Conte’s hair transplant on United’s pre-season tour in July 2017.</i>

      <p>“He was in front of me and I was making every decision for him. He has to change his football brain. We need his fantastic physical and technical qualities but he cannot play with my brain,” – after a 1-1 draw with Everton in April 2017, Luke Shaw is told to “grow up” quickly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>“Manchester United sold players that I would never sell and bought players that I would never buy. I would never have sold (Angel) Di Maria, Chicharito (Javier Hernandez), Danny Welbeck – never, no chance,” – questions United’s transfer policy on March 16, 2017.</i>

      <p>“They can call me what they want. Until the moment they have a manager that wins four Premier Leagues for them, I’m the number one. When they have somebody that wins four Premier Leagues for them, I become number two. Until this moment Judas is number one,” –Mourinho responds to Chelsea supporters labelling him ‘Judas’ during United’s 1-0 FA Cup quarter-final loss at Stamford Bridge on March 13, 2017.</p>

          <i>“There is a difference between the brave, who want to be there at any cost, and the ones for whom a little pain can make a difference,” – appears on November 7, 2016, to cast doubt on Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw’s claims they are injured after the defensive pair missed a win at Swansea.</i>
