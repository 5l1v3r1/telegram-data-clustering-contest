      <p>Iraqi man Saad Harbi Haid Al-Karawi, 28, was diagnosed with dystonia, a rare neurological disorder which makes muscle contract involuntarily, causing repetitive or twisting movement.</p>
      <p>He started experiencing the symptoms at the age 14, which he develops abnormal movement that sees him bending backwards and tilting his head uncontrollably.</p>
      <p>The genetic disorder also left Saad bed-ridden for three years.</p>

      <p>He underwent a 10-hour operation which doctors placed electrodes deep inside his brain.</p>
      <p>The complex surgery has a margin of error of less than 0.5mm. Once placed, they are connected to an implant placed in the chest.</p>

      <p>Dr Vaishya said: "It took 8 to 10 hours to implant the device.</p>
      <p>"The device now delivers carefully controlled electrical stimulation to targeted areas in the brain.</p>
      <p>"He has shown visible signs of recovery within a week after the surgery."</p>
