      <p>After just releasing its <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/medicom-toy-porters-tanker-bearbrick-release">TANKER-inspired BE@RBRICK</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/yoshida-porter">Yoshida PORTER</a> has announced a new store opening in the heart of Shibuya, Tokyo. Dubbed PORTER EXCHANGE, the store will be located at <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Shibuya-PARCO">Shibuya PARCO</a>, the same establishment where <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Hajime-Sorayama">Hajime Sorayama</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/Daniel-Arsham">Daniel Arsham</a> will lead the upcoming “<a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/sorayama-daniel-arsham-medicom-toy-2g-studio-shibuya-parco-information">2G</a>” exhibition.</p>
      <p>PORTER EXCHANGE, or “PX,” riffs on military inspirations, designing the space to reflect the same commitment to quality that you find in mil-spec. Filled with olive and warm yellow tones, the store’s interior is half an army camp and half a cozy wooden cabin. Most of the space is occupied with a large quilted nylon tarp with neon signage that reads “HEART AND SOUL INTO EVERY STITCH.” Inside is a wall that’s packed with a full range of PORTER’s signature Tanker silhouette, along with some exclusive PX items that are being offered for the store’s opening. A low-hanging bench is placed in the middle, while wooden counters are placed at the sides — the outermost areas of the space are enclosed by green metal fences.</p>

      <p>In line with PORTER EXCHANGE’s opening, a bevy of exclusives have been made.

The ball comes in black with bright orange highlights, stamped with both “SPALDING” and “PORTER” branding over two panels. Another highlight is a pair of gloves made in collaboration with Winning Boxing. The silhouette is available in either black or olive colorways complemented by orange lining.
