      <p>It’s been quite the month for <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/ozzy-osbourne/">Ozzy Osbourne</a>. After a 2019 that has seen him undergo surgery and postpone the entirety of his No More Tours II world tour, The Prince Of Darkness is finally getting back into the groove. Not only has he <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/ozzy-osbourne-announces-rescheduled-uk-and-european-tour-dates-for-2020/">rescheduled his UK tour dates</a>, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/ozzy-osbourne-adds-marilyn-manson-to-rescheduled-north-american-tour-dates/">announced Marilyn Manson</a> for the US leg, and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/ozzy-osbourne-announces-new-album-ordinary-man-listen-to-new-song-under-the-graveyard/">revealed details of a new album</a>, but now he’s inviting everyone to a special event on Friday November 22 where we’ll go “straight to hell.”</p>
      <p>The event, which was posted on Facebook, links to <a href="https://straighttohell.ozzy.com/">a postcard invitation on his website</a>, which reads: “You’re invited to join me this Friday 11/22 - Midnight. You’ll be going… Straight To Hell.”</p>
      <p>The location for the event is also listed as Hell, so you know it’s serious.</p>

      <p>It looks like Ozzy is preparing to unleash a new song, the second single from his forthcoming album Ordinary Man. Upon clicking the postcard, it flips over and allows you to pre-save a track on Spotify/pre-add on Apple Music.</p>

      <p>The new track is the follow-up to Under The Graveyard, released earlier this month. There’s no official release date for Ozzy’s upcoming full-length, but it’s scheduled for early 2020.</p>
      <p>“This is quite possibly the most important album I have done in a very long time, probably since No More Tears,” said Ozzy. “This album was a gift from my higher power – it is proof to me that you should never give up.”</p>
