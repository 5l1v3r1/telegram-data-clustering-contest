      <h3>NATIONAL Capital Region Police Office director, Brigadier General Debold M. Sinas yesterday said their stepped-up anti-narcotics campaign in Metro Manila had already resulted in the arrest of 2,647 offenders and the confiscation of nearly P58 million worth of shabu over the past one-month.</h3>
      <p>“I think we have been producing significant results in the war on drugs in the metropolis as proven by the successful conduct of 1,341 anti-illegal drug operations since last October 12 which not only led in huge number of drug arrests and seizures but also in the confiscation of 30 firearms and explosives which could have been used as an instrument of violence in Metro Manila,” the NCRPO director told the Journal Group.</p>
      <p>Sinas, a member of Philippine Military Academy ‘Hinirang’ Class of 1987 was tasked by the Philippine National Police leadership to replace his mistah, Major General Guillermo Lorenzo T. Eleazar—now the PNP Chief Directorial Staff—to lead all operations to secure the country’s busiest and most densely populated region which is also known as the center of all illegal drug activities in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Records showed that since last October 12, NCRPO agents launched 1,341 successful anti-illegal drug operations which led in the recovery of a total of P57, 352, 518. 52 worth of shabu and marijuana and 30 illegal firearms and explosives.</p>
      <p>Those operations likewise led in the arrest of 2, 647 notorious drug personalities who are now facing charges for violation of Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002.</p>
      <p>During the period, a total of 40 barangays in Metro Manila were also declared as ‘drug-cleared’ after passing all parameters issued by the Dangerous Drugs Board.</p>
      <p>Sinas also assured Metro Manila residents that they are conducting their anti-drug operations in accordance with Police Operational Procedures which gives premium on human rights protection.</p>
      <p>“We are sparing no one in this campaign and assures that human rights will always be protected as part of our effort to restore public’s faith in the police force,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Everybody dreams of a drug-free country and a drug-resistant society. Thus, the NCRPO follows the call of President Duterte in continuously identifying, pursuing and arresting drug personalities with the certainty of punishment,” Sinas said.</p>
