      <p>Besides, the watchdog would amend the norms for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/portfolio-managers">portfolio managers </a>wherein net worth and minimum investment requirements would be raised for such entities.</p>
      <p>About the new disclosure requirements on loan defaults, Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi said the objective is to "get more openness to help investors".</p>
