      <p>Rumours have long been swirling about Ubisoft's follow-up to <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/assassins_creed_odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>. Thought to be <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/04/it_sounds_like_the_next_assassins_creed_will_be_all_about_vikings">all about vikings</a>, the supposed codename for the game is Kingdom. However, according to new scuttlebutt doing the rounds online, Assassin's Creed Ragnarok will be the name of the upcoming sequel.</p>
      <p>One or two sources <a href="https://dailygamingreport.co.uk/latest-gaming-news/rumour-assassins-creed-ragnarok-next-gen-vikings/">have shared this information</a> and more. Allegedly, Ragnarok -- if that's even the real name -- will take place around 800 AD, will delve deeper into the First Civilisation storyline, and will feature a map covering Scandinavia and England. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/dxlk8f/assassins_creed_ragnarok_info/">A now-deleted Reddit post</a> tells us you'll play as a male or female viking named Jora who becomes an assassin during the game. It also says the recruitment system from Brotherhood is back, and that there will be mythical locations and characters to discover. Gameplay will apparently be largely the same as Odyssey, including stints of modern day story. Finally, it's said that Ragnarok will be a cross-gen title, releasing a version for both PlayStation 4 and PS5 next year.</p>
      <p>All of this should be taken with a pinch of salt. It's also suggested that the game will be officially revealed early next year, possibly during Sony's inevitable PS5 unveiling. Everything in these rumours sounds pretty plausible to us, but the sources are questionable at best, so don't get too attached.</p>
      <p>What do you think of all this? Is Ragnarok the subtitle for the next Assassin's Creed? Is all of this total baloney? Tell us your thoughts in the comments below.</p>
