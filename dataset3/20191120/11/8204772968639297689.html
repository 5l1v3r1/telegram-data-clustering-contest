      <h2>Status yellow warning in place for Kilkenny, Wexford and Cork</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-20T11:35:22+00:00">20 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/ronan-mcgreevy-7.1837400" target="_blank">Ronan McGreevy</a></address>
      <p>Very heavy rain is forecast for parts of <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Tipperary">Tipperary</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Waterford">Waterford</a> with an orange warning in place for the both counties.</p>
      <p>Accumulations of more than 50mm (two inches) are expected in both counties from 3pm on Wednesday afternoon until Thursday evening at 6pm.</p>
      <p>A status yellow weather warning is in place for the neighbouring counties of Kilkenny, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Wexford">Wexford</a> and Cork for the same timeframe with accumulations of between 25mm and 50mm expected.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Met+%C3%89ireann">Met Éireann</a> forecaster <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Liz+Walsh">Liz Walsh</a> said the heavy rain is being caused by a southeasterly air flow which normally results in wet weather on southern and eastern coasts.</p>
      <p>She said one particular pulse of rain will be dwelling over Waterford and south Tipperary which will feed in heavy showers over a prolonged period.</p>
      <p>A status orange warning is the second highest level of Met Éireann warning. It is described as “infrequent and dangerous weather conditions which may pose a threat to life and property”.</p>
      <p>Ms Walsh said the very heavy rain will be localised. Fortunately rainfall in the area has been below average for the month so there is not a threat of rivers in the area bursting their banks.</p>
      <p>However, there is a possibility of flash flooding in affected areas.</p>
