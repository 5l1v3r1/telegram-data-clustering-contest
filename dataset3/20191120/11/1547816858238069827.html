      <p>Shah Rukh Khan and wife Gauri Khan are parents to three wonderful kids Aryan Khan, Suhana Khan, and AbRam Khan. While the star kids have garnered their fame from a very young age, the trio is popular on the internet. With fans going all crazy with videos and pictures of AbRam, some videos on social media featuring AbRam are too cute. Recently, as the videos of the star kid were shared on social media, the internet is in a frenzy as AbRam brings out the inner artist hidden in him with his skills and understanding.</p>
      <p>Recently, a fan page of <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/tags/abram-khan">AbRam Khan</a> shared adorable videos of the little munchkin enjoying his time at his home Mannat. In the video, AbRam looks endearing as he learns some drawing on a whiteboard. The little munchkin looks too cute as he accompanies his teacher with his intelligence. While AbRam’s teacher helps the little munchkin draw a bearded man on the whiteboard, in the video, the star kid is seen insisting on adding some details to the bearded man drawing. Holding a red marker pen in his hand, AbRam is caught on camera enthusiastically drawing and adding details to the eye-brows and face of the drawing on the whiteboard.

      <p>Another video shared on Instagram featured AbRam making mini placards of his name. While a voice in the video questions the little boy about his cards, AbRam looks lost in his drawing as he writes something holding a marker in his hand. In the video, the little Khan is spotted sitting on a couch, while he is lost in his writing. Dressed in cute white and multi-coloured pajamas, AbRam looks endearing.</p>
