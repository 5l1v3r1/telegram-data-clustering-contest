        <b>A TWISTED killer who murdered a grandmother by stabbing her 47 times said he should be "shot in the head" for his evil crimes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>William Finlay, 57, from Camelon, Falkirk, was jailed for life for slaughtering 44-year-old neighbour Fiona McDonald, also known as Fiona Canning, over a pension row.</p>

      <p>The brute was ordered to spend at least 17 years behind bars for the killing.</p>
      <p>Finlay admitted to the brutal killing in Ms McDonald's flat last November.</p>
      <p>The court heard that he had come back to Falkirk to look after his mother after being made redundant.</p>
      <p>He became friends with Ms McDonald – but their relationship was described as being volatile.</p>
      <p>Defence QC Thomas Ross said: “They had a very complicated relationship. At times they were friends and other times they had violent disagreements.</p>
      <p>“Mr Finlay, who latterly worked as a cleaner in banks and financial institutions, drew a pension payment for £10,000 in March, 2018 and was in debt to the tune of £1,300 by that November.</p>
      <p>“Fiona McDonald had accrued debts and men were turning up at his door looking for money. He believed she had built up debt with drugs using him as credit.”</p>

      <p>Sentencing Finlay at Glasgow’s High Court, judge Lady Stacey said: “Nothing can take away the grief her family feel. Her mother, daughter and grandchildren have been deprived of her company.</p>
      <p>“It is not up to me to decide when, if ever, you will be released, that is up to the parole board.”</p>
      <p>Finlay told police, who questioned him, that he was pushed to his limits and could not apologise enough for killing someone, but said it was “revenge”.</p>
      <p>He said he believed she had been “rinsing him” of his £10,000 pension payment.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Margaret Barron said: “He stated to witnesses that she had been 'rinsing him' and was constantly asking for money.”</p>
      <p>The court heard that Finlay, who was covered in blood, turned up at a friend's house and confessed to the shocking murder.</p>
      <p>When Finlay left the house his friend dialled 999.</p>
      <p>Finlay also told neighbours: “I've just murdered Fiona.”</p>
      <p>When they rushed to her flat they saw her seated on a couch “just staring into the sky,” with blood all over her body.</p>
      <p>A small kitchen knife was found near to her body.</p>
      <p>Finlay, when arrested, told police officers: “Junkies bothering me, that's why I got my revenge.</p>
      <p>“I took it out on a poor woman who robbed me for thousands of pounds.</p>
      <p>“I deserve to be shot in the head for what I've done tonight.</p>
      <p>"I apologise for doing it, but you can't apologise for killing someone – this is what happens when you get pushed to the limits.”</p>
      <p>Defence QC Mr Ross said: “It is unusual for someone with no history of violence to behave in such a brutal fashion.”</p>
      <p>He described the attack on Ms McDonald as “brutal and sustained”.</p>
      <p>Finlay showed no emotion as he was led away to begin his sentence.</p>
