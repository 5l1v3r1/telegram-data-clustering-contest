      <p>Amazon is in the midst of ramping up its sales drive as we get closer to Black Friday with plenty of discounts on its own-brand gadgetry.</p>
      <p>We’ve covered several of the best deals on Amazon already through <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/best-amazon-countdown-to-black-friday-deals-today-as-price-slash-continues-11174914/">its ‘Countdown to Black Friday’ sale</a>, but it turns out there are even greater savings to be had.</p>
      <p>The gigantic online retailer is seemingly knocking even more coin off its Fire TV and Echo smart speaker products – as long as you ask Alexa about it.</p>
      <p>Engaging the voice assistant can lead to savings of as much as 40% off the aforementioned products. Specifically, you can bag the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Ultra and the Echo Show 5 smart speaker if you ask Alexa.</p>
      <p>Just say ‘Alexa I want to buy the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Ultra’.</p>
      <p>The product is usually listed at £49.99, but when you head to the checkout, the £20 (39%) discount will have been applied. The same goes for the Echo Show 5.</p>

      <p>You don’t even need to have an Alexa smart speaker to get this discount – you can do it through your phone (iPhone or Android) by downloading and installing the Alexa app for free.</p>
      <p>Obviously, Amazon has a vested interest in getting you to buy heavily-discounted Echoes and Fire TVs as it puts users more firmly into the company’s ecosystem. But if you’ve already committed to this and have an Echo or Fire TV device (not to mention a Prime subscription) then this is an economical way to augment your collection.</p>
