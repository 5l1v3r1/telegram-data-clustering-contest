        <b><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/death-stranding/">Death Stranding</a>. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Death Stranding </i>is the latest game from cult creator, Hideo Kojima, and while its reception is <a href="https://www.cbr.com/death-stranding-early-review-round-up/">receiving mixed reviews</a>, players are picking up the game to make this decision for themselves. As well as its peculiar premise, another big draw is the celebrity cameos that appear in holographic form that can be found hidden throughout <i>Death Stranding</i>.</p>
      <p>Actor Norman Reedus plays Sam, a porter and the main protagonist of <i>Death</i> Stranding, making him less of a footnote -- as the entries on this list are -- and more of the face of the entire game. Reedus is primarily known for his role as Daryl Dixon in <i>The Walking Dead </i>TV series, and he isn't the only Hollywood star in this game. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/death-stranding-early-review-round-up/">It was previously hinted</a> that writer/director, Guillermo del Toro, and actor, Mads Mikkelson would join Reedus as castmates in <i>Death Stranding</i>, and this rumor has turned out to be true. Del Toro's likeness is used for a character called Deadman due to his creepy <i>Frankenstein </i>connection, while Mikkelson plays Clifford Unger, one of the game's mysterious antagonists.</p>
      <p>The other, mostly lesser-known, celebrities who have lent their likeness to <i>Death Stranding</i><i> </i>make for interesting Easter eggs and their presence adds a layer to the existing complexity of the game. If you were on the fence about purchasing a copy of <i>Death Stranding</i>, perhaps these cameos will help seal the deal.</p>
