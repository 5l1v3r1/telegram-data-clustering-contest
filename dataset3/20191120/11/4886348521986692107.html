        <li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 236 points on Wednesday.</li>
        <li>Ratings agency Moody’s issued a ‘recession triggers’ chart with 16 high-risk events.</li>
        <li>The European Central Bank (ECB) also issued a warning over global growth.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) plunged 236 points on Wednesday, extending a second day of weakness on the stock market. As US-China talks disintegrate once again, Moody’s issued a gloomy assessment of the economy going into 2020.</p>
      <p>In a note to investors, Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi revealed a list of 16 events that could trigger a recession. Top of the list, as you might expect, is the ongoing trade war between US and China. If economic stagnation persists, Zandi warned that unemployment will quickly follow.</p>

      <blockquote>Recession risks for next year remain uncomfortably high. The economy is barely growing at its potential, which means unless growth picks up soon, unemployment will begin to rise.</blockquote>
      <h3>Dow in triple-digit plunge</h3>
      <p>The Dow dumped 236 points as of 1.23 pm ET. Wall Street extends <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-falters-as-trump-threats-negate-stellar-us-housing-market-data/">yesterday’s miserable trading session amidst a backdrop of US-China trade war confusion</a>.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell 0.81% and 1.13% respectively. <a href="https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-price/">Bitcoin also traded lower at $8,068</a>.</p>

      <h3>Recession risks, ranked according to risk and severity</h3>
      <p>Zandi ranked the recessionary triggers according to their likelihood and their potential impact on the economy. He ranks <b>global trade war escalation</b> at the top, both highly likely and severe in its impact.</p>
      <p>He added:</p>
      <blockquote>If the president follows through on his threat to raise tariffs again on China in December, a recession next year is likely. However, if the president stands down and provides a clear path to winding down the tariffs, the economy will likely avoid a recession.</blockquote>
      <p>Other likely triggers include a <b>manufacturing recession</b>, <b>escalating violence in Hong Kong</b>, <b>Trump’s impeachment</b> and an <b>equity market drawdown</b>. These events, however, would have low-medium impact on the economy.</p>
      <p>On the other end of the spectrum, the <b>removal of Fed chairman Jerome Powell</b> and the <b>return of a European debt crisis</b> would have a seismic impact on the global economy. However, these events are less likely.</p>
      <p>The most concerning group are those in the middle of the chart; both likely and potential seismic. Zandi puts ‘<b>central bank policy error</b>,’ ’<b>no deal Brexit</b>,’ and ‘<b>oil price shock</b>’ in this bucket.</p>
      <h3>ECB adds more pressure to the Dow</h3>
      <p>If that weren’t enough doom and gloom for one day, the European Central Bank threw fuel on the fire this morning. In a fresh report, the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/ecb-warns-of-further-economic-risks-in-financial-stability-report.html">central bank warned of “persistent downside risks” going into 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>Specifically, the report highlighted the dramatic slowdown in European bank profitability (<a href="https://www.ccn.com/deutsche-bank-stock/">here’s looking at you, Deutsche Bank</a>). The ECB also warned that investors were increasingly taking high risks.</p>
      <blockquote>Downside risks to global and euro area economic growth have increased and continue to create financial stability challenges.</blockquote>
