      <h1>Dubai Airshow: Emirates makes $9-bn order for 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners</h1>
      <h2>Emirates tentatively ordered 40 Dreamliners in 2017</h2>

      <p>Emirates unveiled a $9 billion order for 30 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/boeing">Boeing </a>787 Dreamliners on Wednesday, paving the way for a 16 per cent reduction in orders for the delayed 777X airliner to 126 aircraft following intense last-minute talks during the Dubai Airshow.</p>
      <p>The order shake-up completes a fleet review at the host chairman carrier that also saw Europe's Airbus leave the largest Middle East air show with a mixed result in wide-body orders from the world's largest buyer of wide-body long-haul jets.<br/><br/>Emirates tentatively ordered 40 Dreamliners in 2017 but "tough" talks to finalise the order this week had hinged on negotiations over the fate of a massive separate order for 150 777X after the latter ran into delays.</p>
