      <p>For the 22nd year, Kelowna's Landmark District will shine bright in the glow of the Tree of Hope.</p>
      <p>The 120-foot tree, resplendent with 25,000 LED bulbs, will be lit Thursday evening at 5:45 by Mayor Colin Basran and his family.</p>
      <p>Unlike past years, when the light up has been a community event, due to construction in the area, this year's light up is more low key.</p>
      <p>"We don't really encourage people to come out to the base of the tree. There's no event there, it's a private tenant event," said Dallas Gray, commercial leasing and marketing agent for the Stober Group</p>
      <p>"Last year, there was a market event all weekend, but we just don't have the space to do it this year. Probably in the future, once we get our new building done and our new public events centre on the seventh floor, that changes everything."</p>
      <p>Gray encourages people to enjoy the light up from vantage points around the city, including Dilworth Mountain, Parkinson Rec Centre or the pedestrian overpass.</p>
      <p>This will be the first tree lighting since the passing of Stober Group founder Al Stober.</p>
      <p>"This was kind of his baby, his idea," said Gray.Â "It's definitely very much different this year, for sure."</p>
      <p>A $50,000 donation will again be made to UBC Okanagan's Health and Wellness Study on Youth on behalf of the Landmark tenants, TD Canada Trust and the Tree of Hope.</p>
