      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/turkey.html">Turkey</a>'s defence ministry announced about 200 Syrian <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/refugees.html">refugees</a> have returned home following Ankara's offensive against Kurdish forces in northeastern <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/syria.html">Syria</a>.</p>
      <p>"Close to 200 of our Syrian brothers who had fled the [Kurdish] PKK/YPG ... have voluntarily and safely returned to their homes and lands," it said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Turkey launched its offensive on October 9, aiming to push back what it called "terrorist" elements from the border region east of the Euphrates River and establish a "safe zone" stretching at least 30km (19 miles) into Syria to resettle some of the 3.6 million refugees it hosts.</p>
      <p>Ankara considers the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/pkk.html">PKK</a>), which has waged a decades-long armed campaign against the Turkish state for secession. Tens of thousands of people have died.</p>
      <p>The PKK is designated a "terrorist" organisation by Turkey, the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html">United States</a>, and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/organisations/european-union.html">European Union</a>. But unlike Ankara, Washington and Brussels do not consider the YPG and its political wing - the Democratic Union Party - as "terrorist" groups.</p>
      <p>The defence ministry said the families had taken refuge in Jarablus, a Syrian town to the west of the Euphrates that was brought under Turkish control during an operation in 2016.</p>
      <p>"It is expected that with the re-establishment of peace and security in the Peace Spring operation area, the returns will continue," the ministry said.</p>
      <p>"Within that framework, 70 families consisting of 295 people have taken the road from Jarablus to return to the Tal Abyad area."</p>
