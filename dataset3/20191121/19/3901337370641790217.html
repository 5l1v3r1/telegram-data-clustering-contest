      <h1>Mnqgithi: It Won’t Be Enough Until He Wins...  </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Golden Arrows coach Steve Komphela has an admirer in Manqoba Mnqgithi, the only coach – to date – to have won a trophy with the same team.</p>
      <p>It was in 2009 that Mnqgithi, now assistant coach at Mamelodi Sundowns, brought home to Lamontville the MTN8 trophy and no coach has done it since, though he is desperate to see Komphela succeed at Arrows.</p>

      <p>“But maybe not at our expense first,” said Mnqgithi ahead of Downs facing Arrows at the Sugar Ray Xulu Stadium on Saturday in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout.</p>
      <p>“Steve has natured them, but it will never be enough until he has won something. Whatever he is doing will always be overshadowed by the fact that he has not won a cup with them. But it is very interesting to watch them play” he adds. </p>
      <p>“It’s never easy to win a trophy with teams that don’t predominantly compete to win trophies. One would say I was the lucky one. And Steve can still do it. He has been unlucky – he went to the final with Manning Rangers, twice with Kaizer Chiefs, but he has been unfortunate. Even at Dynamos and Maritzburg United he did well and he was building towards a championship team at Chiefs (before resigning in April last year).” </p>
      <p>Mnqgithi started an academy at Arrows and many of the players in the senior team currently, were only still developing when he left. But he is really only remembered for the trophy he won, following an unforgettable 6-0 victory over Ajax Cape Town a decade ago.</p>
      <p>“Our job is a very thankless job. Up until you can put something on the table, people will not respect you. We will always say this guy is good, but in our society we define success with something on the table. There are many coaches who have won trophies, but have never introduced any player into the game or promoted any young boy to make him a household name. There’s no team where Steve has coached and not done well. He leaves a good legacy, but we stigmatise success with trophies,” said Mnqgithi.</p>
