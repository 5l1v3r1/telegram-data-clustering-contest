      <p>With close to 50 flights to the temple town of Shirdi being hit due to bad weather since November 14, SpiceJet on Thursday announced it would be temporarily shifting its operations to Aurangabad.</p>
      <p>A SpiceJet spokesperson said, “Owing to bad weather conditions resulting in low visibility in Shirdi, flight operations to and from Shirdi airport have been affected for the past one week. To offer connectivity to the temple town and lessen the inconvenience to the passengers and devotees, SpiceJet has decided to shift the flight operations to Aurangabad, which is the nearest airport to Shirdi.”</p>
      <p>SpiceJet operates daily flights to Shirdi from Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bengaluru. Between November 22 and 26, all operations will be shifted to Aurangabad, the airline said. Aurangabad is 124 km from Shirdi and takes about three hours by road.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson said passengers have been informed about the change in their travel itineraries through the medium of e-mails, SMS, call centres and social media. Passengers have also been offered a full refund if they do not wish to travel to Aurangabad during the said dates.</p>
      <p>“SpiceJet is in constant communication with Shirdi Airport authorities and is closely monitoring the weather condition. Passengers will be duly informed on the resumption of services at Shirdi airport as and when the visibility improves for safe aircraft operations,” the spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Shirdi airport director Deepak Shastri said, “There is a constant haze in Shirdi. This has been caused as the soil is wet (from past rainfall) and bright sunshine is leading to evaporation. Adding to this is the fact that there is is no wind blowing and this phenomena is causing low-visibility. The current visibility is up to 3.5 km, while the required visibility for Shirdi is 5 km.” The airport has been in operation since October 2017.</p>
      <p>Besides SpiceJet, Air India and Indigo offer flights to Mumbai, Indore, Bengaluru, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad and Jaipur from Shirdi.</p>
