      <p>The floods that wreaked havoc in the State for two successive years were the theme of the presentation by students of Government Girls HSS, Pattom, in the Mime competition at the festival.</p>
      <p>The landslips in Malappuram and in Wayanad, the fisherman K.P. Jaisal who helped women board a boat by stepping on his back all were depicted by the seven students.</p>
      <p>“We also highlighted the good in mankind through depiction of a man who loses his entire family but puts his grief behind him to take part in relief operations,” say the students.</p>
