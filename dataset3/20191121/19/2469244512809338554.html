      <p>Crow Dawn are making a welcome return to Uffculme next week.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, November 30, they will be at The Ostler Inn Playing rock covers from the 60s to the present day.</p>
      <p>Jim Clancy from the pub said: “Expect to be rocking your socks off to Led Zeppelin, Queen, Deep Purple, Status Quo, The Police, Pink Floyd, Beatles, AC/DC, Muse, Squeeze, Rush and many more.</p>
      <p>“Mike, Rob, Tim and Steve are real entertainers who like to break the usual boundaries between the audience and band – and boy can they play.</p>
      <p>“As usual the music starts at 9:00pm and it’s live and free.”</p>
