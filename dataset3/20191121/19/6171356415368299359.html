      <h1>Google Assistant now works better with G Suite accounts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:18:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>One of the most common complaints we hear whenever a new Google product arrives (besides the pile of "when is it getting shut down" unoriginal jokes) is that G Suite users either can't try the new product at all, or there is limited functionality. Assistant has historically been extremely limited for G Suite accounts, but some of that is changing today.</p>
      <p>"Weâ€™re opening a beta program to allow G Suite users to accomplish more on-the-go with the Google Assistant when logged in with a G Suite account," Google wrote on its G Suite blog. The new functionality includes creating/rescheduling calendar events, sending an email, and dialing into a meeting.</p>

      <p>The beta program has to be enabled by the admin(s) of each G Suite organization, so it's not something individuals can turn on right now. There's also one caveat: if you have both a regular Google account and a G Suite account, Assistant can only answer questions for one of them at a time.</p>
      <p>There's no word on when <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/18/googles-making-it-stupidly-difficult-to-access-the-new-assistant-if-you-use-a-g-suite-account/">G Suite accounts will be able to use the updated Google Assistant</a> that first arrived on the Pixel 4. The post also didn't mention when <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/15/no-google-assistant-reminders-g-suite/">reminders will become available</a>.</p>
