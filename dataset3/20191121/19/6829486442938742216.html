      <h1>6 Legit Money Saving Life Hacks We Learned From Our Favourite TV Shows</h1>

      <p>TV is full of life advice, some better than others. <i>Arrested Development</i> taught us to always leave a note. Michael Scott told us that we miss 100 percent of the shots we don’t take (or was that Wayne Gretsky?). Jean-Ralphio from <i>Parks and Rec</i>… actually, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm9H0X3tHfU">don’t listen to him</a>.</p>
      <p>But when it comes to money, there’s actually a lot of helpful hacks to be found on the small screen, from characters who’ve dealt with the same budgeting woes as us all. Here are the best money-saving tips ripped straight from TV.</p>
      <h3>Make It Instead</h3>
      <p>Pawnee’s resident libertarian Ron Swanson dispensed a lot of wisdom over <i>Parks and Recreation</i>’s seven seasons. But between his takes on breakfast (the best meal of the day), skim milk (it’s just water that’s lying), and clear alcohol (only for rich women on diets) lay a handy financial tip: DIY, baby.</p>
      <p>Once, instead of shelling out for a pair of expensive wedding bands, Swanson forged some himself out of a lamp he ripped from the wall — something “any moron with a crucible, an acetylene torch, and a cast iron waffle maker” could have done.</p>
      <p>Now, we’re not suggesting you actually start liquefying your own metal (please don’t, actually) but, from making homemade face masks out of <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/how-to/a2830/best-homemade-face-masks/">the things in your pantry</a> to learning to fix busted clothes instead of replacing them with new ones, getting crafty really can save you some serious bucks.</p>
      <p>As Ron says: “People who buy things are suckers”.</p>

      <h3>Don’t Pay Full Price</h3>
      <p>Jack Donaghy might be the richest guy on <i>30 Roc</i>k (“Money doesn’t buy happiness, money <i>is</i> happiness,” was a particularly profound moment for the TV executive), but I prefer to take my financial advice from one Liz Lemon. After all, why pay full price for a donut — or anything — when you could wait for it to go on sale?</p>

      <p>Plan ahead and stock up on the essentials during those Boxing Day bonanzas, wait for a lucrative discount code before you buy that new pair of shoes… or just lurk around the bakery at closing time.</p>
      <h3>Get A Side Hustle</h3>
      <p>Even the top selling salesman at Dunder Mifflin needs a second income stream. So do as Dwight Schrute did and get a side hustle (just, um, probably not while you’re meant to be doing your full-time job) that adds a bit of breathing room to your budget.</p>
      <p>Dog walk, drive Uber, build an online business, tutor students… or, if you’ve got a family beet farm at your disposal, consider “agritourism”. Remember, it’s a lot more than just a bed and breakfast: “It consists of tourists coming to a farm, showing them around, giving them a bed, giving them breakfast”.</p>

      <h3>Or Get Entrepreneurial</h3>
      <p>Frugal queens Abbi and Ilana came up with a lot of, ahem, <i>creative</i> ways to make a buck on <i>Broad City</i>. But perhaps their savviest move of all happened after Ilana got hit with a $400 exterminator bill and decided to break even by hosting a cocktail party… which she charged a bunch of random dudes from Tinder $10 to attend. Does it all go to plan? No, not really. Is it funny as hell? You bet.</p>
      <p>Of course, they could have just put the unexpected bill on a low rate, low annual fee credit card and paid it off when they’d had some time to formulate a mildly sensible plan, but then we wouldn’t have all this comedic gold.</p>
      <h3>Always Save 10 Percent</h3>
      <p>Back in 1996, <i>Friends</i> was doling out important money lessons.</p>
      <p>After Monica loses her job at a restaurant and finds herself unable to pay rent, she invites her dad over for dinner with the intention of asking for a loan. Instead, he reminds her of the wisdom he imparted to her as a child: always make sure you’ve got emergency fund.</p>
      <p>“Where does 10 percent of your pay cheque go?” he asks.</p>
      <p>“In the bank,” Monica and Chandler respond.</p>
      <p>Of course, Monica had not been saving 10 percent and ~dramedy~ ensues. Learn from her mistakes, put a bit aside every pay day and you’ll always have a back-up stashed for when you really need it. Thanks, Mr. Geller.</p>
      <h3>Last – But Not Least – Know When To Spend</h3>
      <p>But even the thriftiest among us have to accept that sometimes, cutting corners isn’t the way to go. In one of the best/worst <i>Seinfeld</i> moments ever, George’s stinginess has a body count when he forces his fiancé to buy wedding invites so cheap that they’re laced with toxic glue. She licks a bunch of envelopes and promptly expires on the couch. Again, the savvy use of a credit card really could have helped here.</p>
      <p>RIP, Susan.</p>
