      <h1>Gov't begins massive road construction in Central Region</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:24:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author">Isaac Arkoh, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Cape Coast, Nov. 21, GNA - Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia on Thursday cut the sod for massive road construction works to begin in Cape Coast and other parts of the Central Region.</p>
      <p>Thirty kilometres stretch of roads within the Cape Coast Metropolis and its adjoining communities would be constructed as part of the two-billion-dollar Government of Ghana/Sinohydro Master Project Support Agreement.</p>
      <p>The beneficiary communities are Amamoma, Akotokyir roads and links, English-Arabic, Planned Parenthood Association of Ghana (PPAG) Road, Abura New Market, reconstruction of the Cape Coast Technical University Road and links and Kwaprow link roads.</p>
      <p>Others are Amissano, Bessakrom, Dankwakrom, Ayifua, Kakumdo, Academy Street, Methodist Mission link, Ghana Highway Authority Road, Ecole Francaise, NEST Road and links, Old ATL and Anglican School roads.</p>
      <p>Also, critical bridges and drains would be constructed alongside earth works, bituminous surfacing and asphalt overlay within the Metropolis.</p>
      <p>In other parts of the Region, construction works would soon begin on the Assin-Fosu to Assin-Praso Highway, Winneba-Swedru-Essiam Road and Assin-Fosu to Twifo-Praso Road to be built into an asphaltic carriageway.</p>
      <p>Vice President Bawumia said the commencement of the road infrastructure projects was a manifestation of the strong bilateral ties between Ghana and China.</p>
      <p>He commended Mr Shi Ting Wang, the Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, for working hard to ensure the Sinohydro deal materialised.</p>
      <p>He expressed worry over the bad nature of roads in the country and noted that it was in sharp contrast to the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC’s) claim of unprecedented achievement in the road sector during its reign.</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia assured residents of the Region of government’s commitment to completing all the projects on schedule to enable the people to enjoy their fair share of development.</p>
      <p>He expressed government’s resolve to ensuring that the local content clauses in the Agreement were strictly adhered to in order to create jobs for the indigenes including contractors, artisans and cooks.</p>
      <p>Aside the roads, Dr Bawumia announced that Government was working to build 10 landing sites in Teshie in the Greater Accra Region, Axim and Dixcove in the Western Region, Elmina, Winneba, Mumford, Senya-Bereku, Fetteh-Gomoah and Moree in the Central Region and Keta in the Volta Region.</p>
      <p>These are geared towards supporting fishers to improve their livelihoods, create employment and increase their incomes.</p>
      <p>In addition, through the Coastal Development Authority, government had also procured 5,000 outboard motors to be distributed to fishers in the various fishing communities.</p>
      <p>Dr Bawumia entreated Ghanaians to join hands with the Government to bring progress and prosperity to every part of the country.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwasi Amoako-Attah, the Minister of Roads and Highways, said quality roads were a priority of the Akufo-Addo-led Administration and expressed the hope that their completion would boost socio-economic activities and bring travelling reliefs to all.</p>
      <p>He reminded the Ministry to make sure there was adequate supervision of all the projects to guarantee quality jobs and value for money.</p>
      <p>Mr Amoako-Attah asked for maximum cooperation and collaboration between contractors and the Ministry for smooth implementation of the projects and gave the assurance that people affected by the construction works would be compensated.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwamena Duncan, the Central Regional Minister, pleaded with all to exercise patience and support the Government as it worked to initiate well thought-out programmes and policies to bring economic prosperity to all.</p>
      <p>Dignitaries at the programme included Osabarima Kwesi Atta II, Omanhen of Oguaa Traditional Area, Prof. Joseph Ghartey Ampiah, Chancellor, University of Cape Coast, and party officials.</p>
