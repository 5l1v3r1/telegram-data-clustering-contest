      <h1>Singapore deports Hongkonger over unauthorised protest talk</h1>

      <p>Singapore has deported a Hong Kong YouTube star after he organised a small gathering to discuss the protests convulsing his home city in violation of public assembly laws, police said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The city-state’s elite are increasingly nervous about the unrest in rival financial hub Hong Kong, observers say, as they fear it could inspire demonstrations in the tightly-controlled country where protests are rare.</p>

      <p>Police launched a probe after Alex Yeung, a pro-Beijing restaurateur known for his anti-protest tirades on YouTube, organised the gathering last month in a bar with a handful of people, mostly Hongkongers.</p>
      <p>Organising a public assembly without a police permit in Singapore is punishable by a fine of up to Sg$5,000 (US$3,700). Repeat offenders can be fined up to Sg$10,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months or both.</p>
      <p>But after wrapping up their probe, police decided to give Yeung only a warning and sent him back to Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“Singapore has always been clear that foreigners should not advocate their political causes in Singapore, through public assemblies, and other prohibited means,” said a police statement.</p>

      <p>In a video posted after police launched a probe, Yeung had accused supporters of the protests of setting him up at the gathering.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong has been shaken by nearly six months of increasingly violent demonstrations, with protesters calling for greater democratic freedoms and police accountability.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that Singapore would be “finished” if similar protests erupted there.</p>
      <p>“It will become impossible to govern Singapore, to make and carry out difficult decisions or to plan for the long-term good of the nation,” he said.</p>
