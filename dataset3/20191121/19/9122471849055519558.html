      <h1>ESPN Analyst Rips T.O. For What He Did On First Take</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:54:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>If nothing else, ESPN’s <i>First Take</i> usually produces great theater. It certainly manufactured some of that this morning when Terrell Owens made an appearance.</p>
      <p>In a contentious segment, Owens castigated Stephen A. Smith for <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/nfc-west/san-francisco-49ers/stephen-a-smith-colin-kaepernick-response-criticism-black">his criticism</a> of Colin Kaepernick. In his comments, Owens said <i>First Take</i> co-host Max Kellerman “seemed blacker” than Smith.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Smith did not take that remark too well. Owens later claimed he didn’t mean any disrespect, but Smith clearly felt otherwise.</p>
      <p>You can see the exchange below.</p>

      <p>Well, at least one ESPN personality was unhappy with the whole ordeal. Former NFL offensive lineman and current analyst Damien Woody blasted Owens–and to some extent his own employer–on Twitter.</p>
      <p>“That stunt @terrellowens pulled on First Take was some clown sh*t. Didn’t add anything substantive to the debate but comes on saying that a white man somehow has more ‘blackness’ than a black man…GTFOH,” Woody wrote.</p>

      <p>No matter how you feel about what was said by Owens and Smith, we’re writing (and you’re reading) about <i>First Take</i>. The show did its job.</p>
