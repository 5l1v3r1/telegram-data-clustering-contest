      <h1>CNN Stunt To Disprove Trump’s Speakerphone Remark BACKFIRES Live On-Air</h1>
      <h2>President challenged public to try to understand someone else’s phone call without speaker</h2>

        <b>Chris “Fredo” Cuomo made an ass out of his network Thursday when he tried to disprove President Trump’s statement that it’s near impossible to understand a phone conversation when it’s not being amplified.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In reference to impeachment hearing testimony from David Holmes, a counselor at the US Embassy in Ukraine who on Thursday claimed he could make out details from a phone call he overheard between President Trump and Ambassador Gordon Sondland, Trump urged members of the public to try it for themselves.</p>
      <p>“I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “My hearing is, and has been, great. Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I’ve even tried, but to no avail. Try it live!”</p>

      <p>Cuomo took the president up on his challenge and “tried it live” — only to have it blow up in his face.</p>
      <p>Cuomo attempted to call his mother and have co-host Dana Bash listen in, but the segment went off the rails when the two parties are unable to hear each other.</p>
      <p>Watch the video of CNN doing what they do best, making utter fools of themselves:</p>

      <p>And here’s a great meme from Carpe Donktum mocking the incident:</p>
