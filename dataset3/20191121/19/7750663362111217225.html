      <h1>Atletico Madrid 'eye January move for Nemanja Matic'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atletico-madrid/"><b>Atletico Madrid</b></a> are reportedly weighing up a January move for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nemanja-matic/"><b>Nemanja Matic</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The 31-year-old has only made five appearances for the Red Devils during the 2019-20 campaign, with just three of those coming in the Premier League after struggling with injury in recent months.</p>
      <p>United have the option to extend Matic's current deal - which expires at the end of the season - for a further 12 months but the club are yet to act.</p>
      <p>The Serbia international has been linked with a move to Serie A ahead of the January transfer window, but according to <i>ESPN</i>, Atletico have joined the race for the experienced midfielder.</p>
      <p>The report claims that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-simeone/"><b>Diego Simeone</b></a> views Matic as an ideal signing with the La Liga giants looking to boost their options in the middle of the park ahead of the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>United confirmed earlier this week that the two-time Premier League title winner was back in training ahead of Sunday's trip to high-flying Sheffield United.</p>
      <p>Matic has contributed three goals and three assists in 92 outings for the 20-time English champions.</p>
