      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/table.html">The pair are level on points</a>, although Forest have a game in hand, and both will be keen to bolster their own playoff chances at the expense of the other on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Bristol City have been very steady performers this term, losing just once in the Championship since <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/bristol-city-vs-leeds-united_game_92956.html">a 3-1 defeat to Leeds United</a> on the opening day of the season.</p>
      <p>A 10-match unbeaten run followed before newly-promoted Luton Town provided <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/luton-town-vs-bristol-city_game_93160.html">an unlikely bump in the road</a>, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lee-johnson/"><b>Lee Johnson</b></a>'s side have continued in the same vein since, going unbeaten in their last four league fixtures.</p>
      <p>It has been a very gung-ho approach from City, who are the league's third-highest scorers but have shipped 21 goals in the process - the worst record in the top nine.</p>
      <p>However, that has not mattered greatly, and the Robins find themselves just three points away from the automatic promotion places.</p>
      <p>Nottingham Forest have also proved their own promotion credentials this term and have had a strong campaign to this point.</p>
      <p>They are level on points with their hosts on Saturday but superior goal difference sees them place higher, thanks in part to the joint-second best defensive record in the league.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sabri-lamouchi/"><b>Sabri Lamouchi</b></a>'s side had been on a 10-game unbeaten run of their own before back-to-back defeats stunted their progress.</p>
      <p>However, Forest have won their last two as they return to form, including <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/championship/nottingham-forest-vs-derby-county_game_93243.html">a 1-0 win over bitter rivals Derby County</a> last time out.</p>

      <p>Bristol City boss Johnson is definitely without long-term absentees <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jay-dasilva/"><b>Jay Dasilva</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/benik-afobe/"><b>Benik Afobe</b></a> ahead of this clash - two important players to the squad.</p>
      <p>However, he could be boosted by the returns of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/korey-smith/"><b>Korey Smith</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jack-hunt/"><b>Jack Hunt</b></a> from injury after both made good progress over the international break.</p>
      <p>Forest manager Lamouchi has a number of players on the cusp of a return from injury, but it remains to be seen which will be able to feature on Saturday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alfa-semedo/"><b>Alfa Semedo</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/samba-sow/"><b>Samba Sow</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-dawson/"><b>Michael Dawson</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/yohan-benalouane/"><b>Yohan Benalouane</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/carl-jenkinson/"><b>Carl Jenkinson</b></a> are all closing in on comebacks and will be assessed ahead of this clash.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tendayi-darikwa/"><b>Tendayi Darikwa</b></a>, however, is a long-term absentee and will not be available.</p>
      <p><b>Bristol City possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Bentley; Kalas, Williams, Baker; Hunt, Brownhill, Nagy, O'Dowda, Rowe; Watkins, Weimann</p>
      <p><b>Nottingham Forest possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Samba; Cash, Figueiredo, Worrall, Ribeiro; Watson; Lolley, Yates, Silva, Ameobi; Grabban</p>

      <h3>We say: Bristol City 2-1 Nottingham Forest</h3>
      <p>This is likely to be a close-run affair, but Bristol City may just edge this encounter at home. Expect an entertaining clash from two very consistent performers.</p>
