      <h1>CITU opposes Major Ports Authority Bill</h1>
      <h2>‘It will deprive employees of job security’</h2>

      <p>CITU leaders in a general body meeting on Thursday opposed the Major Ports Authority Bill.</p>
      <p>They demanded that the wage revision agreement reached in June last year and a committee report on the classification and categorisation be implemented. They also wanted that the restrictions on the trade unions in ports imposed by the Shipping Ministry in 2014 be lifted.</p>
      <p>CITU leader B. Jagan said that the Major Ports Authority Bill was opposed all along, but the Centre wanted to pass it in the winter session of Parliament. “If the Bill, in its present form, is passed it would deprive employees of job security, pension and gratuity,” he alleged.</p>
      <h3>Port Hospital</h3>
      <p>The leaders also opposed the move to privatise the Port Hospital and urged that the Visakhapatnam Port Trust (VPT) upgrade it into a super speciality hospital.</p>
