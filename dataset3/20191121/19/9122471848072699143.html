      <h1>ESPN Addresses The Big 12’s College Football Playoff Hopes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:48:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, the College Football Playoff committee released its rankings following Week 12 of the college football season.</p>
      <p>LSU held on to the top spot, while Ohio State, Clemson and Georgia rounded out the top four.</p>
      <p>One of the most interesting story-lines following the release of the rankings was where the Big 12 sits. Oklahoma came in as the conference’s top-ranked program at No. 9.</p>
      <p>It’s a bad spot for the Sooners, who are well outside of the top four and don’t really have a way to get back into the conversation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/gamedaykickoff191121/college-football-playoff-committee-biggest-debates-alabama-oregon-others">ESPN college football analyst Heather Dinich</a> broke down the Big 12’s chances of making the playoff.</p>
      <blockquote>“If beating undefeated Baylor on the road wasn’t enough to give the No. 9 Sooners a significant boost during the regular season, why would beating a one-loss, No. 14 Baylor in the Big 12 title game be worth much more? Oklahoma remains the Big 12’s best hope at a semifinal spot, but it’s going to need some chaos to go along with a conference title.”</blockquote>
      <p>Her comments are in line with what much of the national conversation is. Oklahoma needs massive chaos to have any chance of making the playoff this season.</p>
      <p>Can the Sooners win-out and get some luck along the way?</p>
