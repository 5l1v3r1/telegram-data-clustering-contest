      <p><b>Best answer:</b> At a minimum, you'll want at least 5 Mbps to stream Disney Plus (Disney+). However, if you want to get that 4K glory on offer for some of the content, you are going to need 25 Mbps.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>The need for speed</h4>
      <p>If you're like me, then you've been anxiously awaiting the launch of Disney's streaming service, Disney+. There are so many franchises and stories that are under the Disney umbrella that it's hard not to be hyped. Not only can we rewatch all our favorites, but they will also get further explored through this service. Everything from Marvel to Star Wars and more are getting original content that will let us dive deeper into the worlds we love.</p>
      <p>Now that Disney+ is finally here, we need to make sure that all of our ducks are in a row to stream away without hiccups.</p>
      <p>Part of that process is knowing what internet speed requirements are going to be necessary to use the service. Disney has provided us with a nice simple breakdown of the recommended speeds to get started streaming.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>5.0 Mbps</b> - Recommended for HD quality (1080p)</li>
        <li><b>25 Mbps</b> - Recommended for Ultra HD quality (4K)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Should you have less than ideal internet speeds that keep you from being able to properly stream, consider <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-download-videos-disney-android">downloading your shows</a> possibly overnight or when you have a better connection. This way the speed, or lack there of, won't hinder your enjoyment of the Disney magic.</p>
      <h4>Can I improve my speeds?</h4>
      <p>Most of the time, if you are at home or on Wi-Fi somewhere, you'll get speeds high enough to get at least SD quality streaming. Aside from better speeds typically found via Wi-Fi, the signal is generally more stable, which keeps buffering to a minimum.</p>
      <p>When Wi-Fi isn't available, and you're pulling signals in on your mobile device to stream, you're going to want to be sure you're on LTE. While you may be able to get by with a strong 3G connection, you'll get lower quality video and far more stutters in your stream. If you seem to have a stable internet connection, but there's still buffering, you can do a speed test through <a href="https://fast.com/">Fast</a> and see what you are currently getting. You can also check with your internet service provider (ISP) to see what plan you are on and what speeds you can expect.</p>
      <p>With Disney+ out in the wild, it's good to know these speed benchmarks to get started enjoying the magical world of Disney. There are so many fantastic <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-movies-does-disney-plus-have">movies</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-tv-shows-does-disney-plus-have">TV shows</a> that Disney+ is streaming, from Iron Man to Captain Marvel and The Mandalorian to WandaVision — so I hope you have enough popcorn.</p>

      <p>I 'Tink' this is going to be fun</p>
      <p>Disney+ is the first service that will have everything Disney offers in one place. We're talking Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, Pixar, Disney Channel, and more.</p>
