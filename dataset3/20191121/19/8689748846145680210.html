      <p>According to Fuse ODG who was speaking on Shatta Wale’s recent outburst about being nominated for Grammy’s awards, as long as Beyonce’s Lion King Album was nominated for Grammy’s it automatically means Shatta Wale was nominated as well because his track is also on the album.</p>
      <p>After Beyonce’s Lion King Album was nominated in the Best pop vocal Album category for the 2019 Grammy Awards, there’s been a lot of controversy and discussion on social media on whether Shatta Wale is allowed to say he is a Grammy Awards nominee, via his co-writing/ performance in the “Already” song featured on the album.</p>
      <p>Responding to this, Fuse ODG explained that he was awarded a Grammy’s award via the same means for co-writing Ed Sheeran’s “Divide” album which won the best vocal pop album at the 2018 Grammy Awards hence he sees no sense in why Ghanaians are discrediting Shatta Wale.</p>
