      <p><b>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</b> - A south Charlotte man claims he nearly ate a scorpion last week after bringing home blackberries he bought from a local grocery store.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/charlotte-man-says-he-found-scorpion-in-berries-bought-at-local-grocery-store/1010576339">Tim Fox said he made</a> the disturbing discovery last Tuesday evening, and he’s not happy with how the store where he said he purchased the fruit handled his complaint.</p>
      <p>He said it happened while eating his snack at work at a car dealership in Rock Hill.</p>

      <p>"When I went to put one of the berries in my mouth, it was kind of hanging from it,” he said.</p>
      <p>Fox said he didn’t realize what it was at first and immediately threw it in the trash.</p>
      <p>“I went back, and I looked in the trash and I picked this scorpion up and it was dead,” he said. “I put it on my desk at work and I had about four coworkers around me, and we were like, ‘Oh my God.’”</p>
      <p>Fox, who lives in Ballantyne, said he buys berries from the Harris Teeter almost every week. He purchased the MegaBerryes brand blackberries two days before eating them.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/charlotte-man-says-he-found-scorpion-in-berries-bought-at-local-grocery-store/1010576339">The day he opened the fruit and saw the scorpion</a>, Fox said he called the Harris Teeter and asked a manager to remove the packages from the produce section before actually going to the store to speak with the manager face-to-face.</p>
      <p>“I showed him what I had, and he didn’t really act like he cared, and didn’t really say a whole lot about it,” Fox said.</p>
      <p>He said the manager showed him about 10 packages he removed from the shelf, but Fox thinks more should have been done.</p>
      <p>“They should have immediately taken every single blackberry in that store and went through every single package,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/charlotte-man-says-he-found-scorpion-in-berries-bought-at-local-grocery-store/1010576339">Fox gave the manager his phone number</a> and asked for a call from the grocery chain’s corporate office, but said he called the corporate office last Wednesday after he didn’t get a call back right away.</p>
      <p>He said the company offered him a $500 gift card, but he turned it down. Fox said he would like something more substantial.</p>
      <p>“I just think that they need to understand that they need to be more careful,” he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/charlotte-man-says-he-found-scorpion-in-berries-bought-at-local-grocery-store/1010576339">WSOC contacted Harris Teeter</a> and a communications manager responded to the request for comment in an email, writing:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Harris Teeter is conducting a thorough investigation. Harris Teeter and its vendors are committed to the absolute highest standards in regard to quality. We regret this shopper’s experience did not reflect those standards.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>MegaBerryes, the Texas-based company listed on the package of blackberries, was also contacted but has not yet responded.</p>
