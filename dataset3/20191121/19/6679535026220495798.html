      <p>Benny Behanan, MP, told the Lok Sabha on Thursday that the move to disinvest five major PSUs, including BPCL, would plunge the country into severe economic recession.</p>
      <p>This was tantamount to selling off India, he said, terming it as the result of a frightening stance on the part of the Centre to place the enterprises — BPCL, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, THDCIL and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation — at the feet of big corporations.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the CITU Ernakulam district committee will organise a human protection chain at 4 p.m. on Friday between Chithrapuzha and IRDP gate at Ambalamedu to protest the Centre’s decision to sell its stake in BPCL. CPI(M) leader M.V. Govindan will inaugurate a public meeting to be held later.</p>
