      <p>WILLIAMS, AZ â€” The Williams Ranger District of the Kaibab National Forest will begin burn piles Thursday due to recent wet weather.</p>
      <p>The fires will begin in the Hardy project area, approximately 10 miles northeast of the City of Williams. Fire personnel plan to burn about 546 acres of piles beside Country Road 141 east of Spring Valley.</p>
      <p>The brush pile burns are a part of forest restoration projects to lower forest fuels and improve overall forest health.</p>
      <p>Nearby residents can expect no road or trail closures.</p>
      <p>Piles typically burn quickly and omit less smoke for a shorter amount of time than larger prescribed broadcast burns.</p>
      <p>Although, the Williams Ranger District expects minimal to light smoke and air quality will be monitored closely.</p>
      <p>Fire managers will continue to seek opportunities throughout the winter to conduct pile burns as conditions allow.</p>
