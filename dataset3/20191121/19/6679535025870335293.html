      <p>Kochi Metro Rail Limited (KMRL) has begun the initial pile load test for the metro corridor between Petta and SN Junction, the first major work being directly executed by KMRL on the stretch.</p>
      <p>The load test is being conducted to validate the safe pile capacity considered for design. “The initial reports are positive. It is a matter of great pride for KMRL, and we are going ahead with the work,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, managing director, KMRL.</p>
      <p>The agency is expected to complete the metro viaduct on the stretch in 24 months. The contract was awarded in August 2019.</p>
      <p>The test load is 1,075 tonnes, which is 2.5 times the safe load of 430 tonnes considered in design.</p>
      <p>During the test, load is transferred to the pile using three 600-tonne capacity jacks in increments of 20% of test load (86 tonnes) and is maintained for around two hours. The settlement of the pile is measured every 15 minutes using dial gauges attached at four locations on the surface of the pile. KEC-CCECC will execute the viaduct and station work.</p>
