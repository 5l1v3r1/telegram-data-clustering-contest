      <h2>It was the third attempted break in at the store</h2>

      <p>A shop that was targeted by ram raiders this morning has reopened to customers.</p>
      <p>Police said that the raiders used a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/local-news/thugs-driving-coach-ram-co-3561174">coach and a telescopic handler to ram into the front of the Moira Co-op</a>, in Shortheath Road, in the early hours of this morning, Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>They had apparently been trying to steal the cash machine from the store.</p>
      <p>However, they left empty handed and abandoned the coach and telescopic handler at the scene.</p>
      <p>Now, despite suffering significant damage, the store has reopened.</p>
      <p>A post on social media from a member of staff at the store reads: "Moira Co-op will be open this evening.</p>
      <p>"We do not have a cash machine due to the damage it sustained.</p>
      <p>"Everything in store is safe, including the colleagues, which is our priority.</p>
      <p>"I would like to personally thank everyone in the community for their support."</p>
      <p>Anyone with information should call Leicestershire Police on 101, quoting reference 19*623150.</p>
