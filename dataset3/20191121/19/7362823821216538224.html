      <p>Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/nikki-haley-embracing-trump-but-not-too-tightly-as-she-maps-her-political-future">Nikki Haley</a> told the "<a href="https://radio.foxnews.com/podcast/fox-news-rundown/">Fox News Rundown</a>" Thursday that congressional <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">Democrats</a> have not reached the threshold proof necessary to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeach</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, despite wanting to do so "really bad."</p>
      <p>"There is nothing that is impeachable there," Haley said. "There is no secret he wanted an investigation opened up. There was no aid withheld."</p>
      <p>"I know the Dems want this really bad, but there is nothing impeachable there," she added. "And they would have maybe a slight bit of, you know, credibility had they not been trying to impeach the president since his very first day [in office]."</p>
      <p>The former South Carolina governor compared impeachment to a political "death penalty" and said Democrats are unsure of where to go next.</p>

      <p>"I think impeachment, I have said it is the death penalty for an elected official," she said earlier in the interview.</p>
      <p>"It's the highest, highest offense you can do against someone. And I just think it's hard to find where the Democrats are trying to go with this because if you just look at the facts, there's nothing impeachable there."</p>
      <p>Haley also said she has already started helping Trump with his 2020 reelection campaign and plans to assist GOP Senate candidates as well.</p>

      <p>"I'll be out there. I've already started doing events for the president. I'll be campaigning for him," she said. "I'm campaigning for senators that are running for office that I think we need to keep the Senate. We want to see us get the House back. And so I'll be involved doing those things."</p>
