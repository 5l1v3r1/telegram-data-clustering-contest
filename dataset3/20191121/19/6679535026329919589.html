      <p>Senior scientists who participated in a seminar here on ‘Western Ghats and Dam Management’ have called for concerted efforts to tackle climate change and advised an integrated approach to hazard monitoring and mitigation.</p>
      <p>The one-day event was organised at the National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) in connection with the Swasraya Bharat, Kerala Science Fest - 2019. N.H. Ravindranath, Professor, Centre for Sustainable Technologies, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, said it was high time climate change projections began to be incorporated in the planning process.</p>
      <p>Many of the environment-related issues such as land degradation were “silent killers”, he said, calling for sincere efforts to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.</p>
      <p>For Kerala, the generation of flood hazard models is the need of the hour, N. Purnachandra Rao, Director, NCESS, said referring to the recent flood disasters in the State.</p>
      <p>The post-flood scenario in 2018 had thrown up the fact that instrumentation and monitoring were practically non-existant in the State, he said.</p>
