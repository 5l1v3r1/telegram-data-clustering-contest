      <h1>Retaining top slot in Flute for fourth time</h1>

      <p>She is following in her father’s footsteps. Daughter of flautist Kudamaloor Janardanan, Kalyani J. Iyer bagged first A grade in the Flute event at the Revenue District School Arts Festival for the fourth time in a row.</p>
      <p>A Plus Two Humanities student of Government Girls HSS, Pattom, Kalyani played the krithi Sree Rama Saraswathi to cement her place at the top. Having secured the first A grade at the State School Arts Festival the past three years, Kalyani hopes to make it fourth in a row before she bids adieu to her school life this year.</p>
      <h3>Since Class 8</h3>
      <p>It has not been very long since Kalyani started playing the flute religiously. Her father is her guru. “It was with a ‘Happy birthday’ tune on the flute to her father that Kalyani started playing the flute when she was in Class 8,” says her mother Ramya who is employed with a firm at Technopark.</p>
      <p>Though he does tell Kalyani to practice early in the morning to get her breathing right, there is no strict regimen.</p>
