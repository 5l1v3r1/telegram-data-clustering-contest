      <p>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>VIENNA — Saudi Arabia has emphasized that Iran has used its economic revenue from the nuclear deal to trigger unrest in the region.<br/><br/>Addressing the session of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) here, Prince Abdullah Bin Khalid, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Austria, said that Iran’s enrichment at Fordow reactor is a form of blackmail and a threat to the international community.<br/><br/>Heading the Saudi delegation to the IAEA meeting, Prince Abdullah said that reports released by the IAEA on Iran’s violations of the nuclear agreement in terms of enrichment of uranium, the quantity produced from it, the installation of advanced centrifuges, halting all its obligations with regard to research and development, and its recent uranium enrichment at the Fordow facility, amount to blackmailing of and threats to the international community.<br/><br/>“It also underlines the shortcomings of this agreement, and reinforces doubts about the intentions and peacefulness of Iran’s nuclear program,” he said.<br/><br/>Prince Abdullah considered that Iran has misused the economic return from the nuclear agreement in provoking internal unrest in neighboring countries, in light of its insistence on the development of ballistic missiles, supporting terrorist groups in the region, threatening international navigation and maritime straits and destabilizing the security and stability of the region in particular.<br/><br/>“Iran pursues this instead of using that revenue to serve its internal development and improve the situation of the Iranian people and that was reflected by the current internal unrest in Iran, where the Iranian people are fed up with the ideology of its expansionist regime at the expense of its capabilities and needs,” he said.<br/><br/>Prince Abdullah called on the Saudi delegation to take all deterrent measures towards Iran, in order to ensure the maintenance of international peace and security, and to limit Iran’s actions and its aggressive behavior over the past 40 years in the region and the world.</p>
