      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Borderlands 3's latest patch today increases your bank space to 100 slots, which upgrades available up to 300 slots.</li>
        <li>The patch also adds a new Mayhem 4 modifier that boosts the challenge even further.</li>
        <li>All bosses have been updated with new loot pools and dedicated legendary loot.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It finally happened. Gearbox has increased the amount of bank space players can have to store their items on Sanctuary III. The <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-21-borderlands-3-patch-hotfixes-nov-21/">latest Borderlands 3</a> patch brings this welcome change and a host of others to the table which players should he happy to hear as they were common complaints.</p>
      <p>Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite is here, one of Borderlands 3's first big free content drops aside from the Bloody Harvest Halloween event. The Maliwan Blacksite is balanced for 4 players at level 50, and respawning will be disabled. Make sure you get those Second Winds.</p>
      <p>All existing Bank SDUs on Sanctuary III will be upgraded to 100 slots, with additional options to upgrade it it even further at Marcus' shop for a total of 300 if you have the money in-game. This has been a long time coming, especially for those who bought the game after it first released. Legendaries were a bit more common back then before Gearbox nerfed their drop rates, and a lot of players found themselves with too many legendaries and way too little bank space — myself included.</p>
      <p>Gearbox is also adding a Mayhem 4 modifier to crank it up a notch. Mayhem 4 adds "another increase to enemy health, increases the loot drop chances, and adds a set of new legendaries." This Mayhem mode will only roll one positive modifier for the player and one enemy bonus modifier to compensate for the increased health values.</p>
      <p>Additional vending machines have also been added to the following environments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Athenas</li>
        <li>Atlas HQ</li>
        <li>Lectra City</li>
        <li>Jakobs Estate</li>
        <li>Voracious Canopy</li>
        <li>Tazendeer Ruins</li>
        <li>The Pyre of Stars</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rest of the patch focuses on endgame character balancing and general stability of the game.</p>

Why is the November 2019 Update so small, and how does it differ from previous Windows 10 feature updates? You have questions, and we have the answers. Version 1909 is a new type of Windows 10 feature update for Microsoft, as all its features are actually already built-in to the previous version of Windows 10, but are off until you install version 1909.</a>
