      <h1>Zayn Malik ‘Doesn’t Care’ About Harry Styles Shading Him In His SNL Monologue – Here’s Why!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:26:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:26</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>As fans know, Harry Styles did not shy away from shading fellow former One Direction member Zayn Malik while on Saturday Night Live but many also want to know how he reacted to it! As it turns out, one insider report claims to know Zayn couldn’t care less and he is also not planning on clapping back anytime soon.</p>
      <p>During his SNL monologue, Harry shaded Zayn by pretending he did not remember his name.</p>
      <p>But that is not even all as, when he did ‘remember’ he referred to him as ‘Ringo’ who, just like Zayn, was the first member to leave his band – The Beatles.</p>
      <p>‘I love those guys. They’re my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis, and, uh…Ringo,’ he said, upsetting many die-hard Directioners who were really hoping their feud was over.</p>
      <p>Previously, reports claimed Harry did not regret taking a shot at his former friend but it seems like it doesn’t matter anyway since Zayn simply doesn’t care.</p>
      <p>‘Zayn was never close to Harry, and towards the end of their time with One Direction, it was definitely toxic, so he does his best to ignore Harry all together. Zayn also did not watch Harry on SNL, and he has no plans to,’ one source tells HollywoodLife.</p>
      <p>That’s not to say the joke hasn’t reached him, because it has, but apparently, ‘he really doesn’t care. He’d rather not see his name in a headline with Harry’s ever again, but he’s not losing sleep over this. Zayn’s mind is on much bigger and better things, mainly Gigi. He’d love to get her back.’</p>
      <p>Indeed, this comes amid speculations that Zayn and Gigi Hadid are in touch once more following her brief romance with Tyler Cameron.</p>
