      <p>Police said earlier one protester was killed near Baghdad's Sinak bridge and one near the adjacent Ahrar bridge.</p>

      <p>Three more were killed later in the day, including two by live fire near the Ahrar bridge.</p>
      <p>Hospital sources said some of the wounded protesters had injuries sustained from live ammunition and others were wounded by rubber bullets and tears gas canisters.</p>
      <p>Protesters are still holding ground, controlling parts of three major bridges in central Baghdad, which lead to the city's fortified Green Zone, where government buildings and foreign embassies are located.</p>
      <h3>Weeks of unrest</h3>
      <p>At least 325 people have been killed and thousands have been wounded since the unrest in Baghdad and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/iraq.html">Iraq</a>'s mainly Shia south began in early October, the largest since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.</p>
      <p>The leaderless movement seeks to dismantle the sectarian system and unseat the government, including Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators said they were against government <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> and lack of basic services despite Iraq's oil wealth.</p>
      <p>Deadly use of live ammunition, tear gas and stun grenades against mostly unarmed demonstrators have stoked the unrest.</p>
      <p>The protests are an eruption of public anger against a ruling elite seen as enriching itself off the state and serving foreign powers, especially Iran, as many Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs, healthcare or education.</p>
