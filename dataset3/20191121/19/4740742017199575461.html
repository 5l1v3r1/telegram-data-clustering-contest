      <h1>David Rodigan, Hot Chip and more announced for New Year events at Boomtown's Area 404</h1>
      <h2>The new venue is hosting events on both New Year's Eve and New Year's Day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:55:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:55</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>There will be plenty of cracking events in Bristol on New Year's Eve, with the city's best clubs hosting parties to see out the year in style.</p>
      <p>One of the most highly anticipated NYE nights this year takes place at Area 404, the sprawling industrial space headed up by the team behind <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/booktown-ticket-prices-sale-information-3469701">Boomtown Festival</a>.</p>
      <p>The 3,500-capacity venue launched with an almighty bang at the end of October - <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/boomtown-bristol-area-404-review-3495344">which we reviewed</a> - and its New Year's Eve knees-up is likely to be absolute belter.</p>
      <p>Better still, the new St Philips festival-inspired club will also open its doors on New Year's Day for those who want to make it a boozy start to 2020.</p>
      <p>Here's everything you need to know about the two events, including the headliners for each one, who have just been announced.</p>

      <p>The four launch nights at Area 404 took the inventive spirit of the Hampshire festival and distilled them into a dystopian industrial landscape, where ticket holders were invited into a crazy immersive indoor party.</p>
      <p>That theme, with guests taking on the roles of survivors of a nuclear event and actors mingling with the crowds, will be extended into New Year’s Eve, with ticket holders encouraged to dress for the occasion.</p>
      <p>Entertaining ticket holders on New Year’s Eve will be legendary reggae <b>DJ Rodigan</b>, the multiple award-winning artist who has graced radio stations across the UK and beyond, known for his incendiary live sets.</p>
      <p>Also helping AREA 404 guests celebrate the start of 2020 will be French trip-hop act <b>Chinese Man</b>, who will blend hip hop, funk, dub, jazz and reggae in a DJ set.</p>
      <p>Complementing the headliners will be AREA 404’s multiple rooms with techno, drum &amp; bass, reggae and disco on offer with a fresh sound around each corner.</p>
      <p>Area 404’s New Year’s Eve event will finish at 4am, before the NYD gets underway...</p>

      <p>From 2pm on January 1 the music will start up again, this time with a different flavour.</p>
      <p>House, disco, techno and cabaret will be the themes of the New Year’s Day event, which will finish at midnight.</p>
      <p>New Year's Day at Area 404 will be headlined by a DJ set from the legendary <b>Hot Chip</b>, who earlier this year released their <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife/hot-chip-bristols-o2-academy-3467799">critically acclaimed seventh album, A Bath Full of Ecstasy</a>.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere the promoters of iconic London LGBTQ+ night and festival collective <b>Little Gay Brother</b> will join forces with Bristol’s own LGBTQ+ event <b>Bitch, Please!</b> for what will be a hugely glamorous event.</p>
      <p>Dancefloor fillers <b>Viva La Disco</b> will also be there to ensure the day - and night - comes with an infectious soundtrack.</p>
      <p>More than 10,000 people got to experience AREA 404’s two launch weekends, which brought the theatrical magic of Boomtown back to the city where the festival was created 11 years ago - creating Bristol’s biggest venue in the process - and many more people will be keen to get in on the action at New Year.</p>
