      <h1>Bristol City's Nathan Baker reveals how Robins plan to stop Lewis Grabban</h1>
      <h2>The Reds and Robins are locked together on 28 points in what's shaping up to be a gripping promotion race</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Cooper</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City will pay close attention to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> striker Lewis Grabban when the two clubs meet in a play-off showdown at Ashton Gate, with just goal difference separating the two clubs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/lewis-grabban">Grabban</a> is one of the Championship’s most potent marksmen already having seven goals to his name this term, and Nathan Baker has revealed just what detail the Robins have paid to the experienced finisher, although he refused to be drawn on suggestions the 31-year-old is the best in the division.</p>
      <p>“It's hard to say,” Baker responded when asked.</p>
      <p>“He's got a good goal-scoring record obviously, but at the end of the day it comes down to that 90 minutes on the Saturday.</p>

      <p>“<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/dangerous-bristol-city-coach-issues-3556364">We'll do our best to try and stop him from scoring</a>.”</p>
      <p>Baker says Lee Johnson and his coaching staff will leave no stone unturned when it comes to preparing for Grabban, and doing their best to stop him being given the chances he thrives on snaffling up, just like his most recent strike in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-demanding-better-nottingham-3550768">the win over Derby</a>.</p>
      <p>"Yeah, we'll study him across the week and we'll get little clips of him and stuff,” said Baker in conversation with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/nathan-baker-nottingham-forest-injuries-3555358">Bristol Live</a>.</p>
      <p>"Weaknesses and strengths and that kind of stuff.</p>
      <p>“You try and keep him down to his weaknesses as much as you can.”</p>
      <p>Fifth will take on sixth in Bristol, with Forest a place above the Robins by virtue of a better goal difference, though Baker doesn’t believe it’s a six-pointer at such an early stage of the campaign.</p>

      <p>“It's very early days but that's what we want to try and do.</p>
      <p>“We want to be promoted - as long as we're picking up points we'll be happy.</p>
      <p>"I think any team in this league is hard to come across at the moment so we'll try and get as many points as we can,” said Baker, who played a pivotal role in helping his side beat Cardiff last time out.</p>
      <p>“It’s great at the moment and coming off the derby win with the clean sheet, from a defensive point of view, it’s been really good.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we can continue on Saturday.”</p>
