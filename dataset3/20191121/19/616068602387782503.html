      <p>The push is on to get those affected by the permanent closure of Kelowna’s Tolko sawmill back in the workforce.</p>
      <p>“They’re starting to look in other places for work, and a lot of them aren’t going back into our industry, which is sad,” United Steelworkers Local 1-423 Kelowna president Pat McGregor says.</p>
      <p>“They see that the industry is changing, and I don’t believe it is. I just think it’s cyclical at the best of times, and we just need a little bit of help that nobody seems to be providing.”</p>
      <p>Nearly 200 workers, including some who are third- and fourth-generation mill employees, are now beginning the tough task of finding new careers after the announcement two weeks ago that the Kelowna mill was closing permanently.</p>
      <p>The union, Tolko and the provincial government are all playing roles in that, but some laid-off union members are hearing that Tolko is not contributing towards transition money.</p>
