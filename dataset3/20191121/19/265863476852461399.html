      <p>Country singer <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/heres-how-sam-hunt-inspires-his-wifes-love-every-single-day-136156/">Sam Hunt</a> – who is well-known for his hits <i>Body Like A Back Road, Drinkin’ Too Much,</i> and <i>House Party</i> – found himself in jail Thursday morning after Nashville police arrested him for drunk driving. Hunt was reportedly driving the wrong way down a road in East Nashville, and he was swerving in and out of his lane.</p>
      <p>According to <i>WJHL NewsChannel 11</i> in Johnson City, Tennessee, Hunt was driving south in the northbound lanes of Ellington Parkway when officers were called to the scene and proceeded to pull Hunt over. According to police, when they encountered the driver – identified as Hunt – he had bloodshot and watery eyes and smelled of alcohol. Hunt also had two empty beers in his vehicle.</p>

      <p>In the court affidavit, it states that Hunt – who has won an American Music Award and a CMT Award – was having “difficult staying in the lane of travel and crossed the center divide several times before a stop was initiated.”</p>
      <p>Police conducted a field sobriety test before arresting Hunt and charging him with driving under the influence and having an open container. The arrest warrant states that Hunt had a blood alcohol level of .173, more than twice the legal limit, and he showed “numerous signs of impairment on all tests conducted.”</p>
      <p>According to the law in Tennessee, a person is prohibited from driving or being in control of a vehicle if they have a blood alcohol content of .08 or greater, or if they are “under the influence of any intoxicant, marijuana, controlled substance, controlled substance analog, drug, substance affecting the central nervous system, or combination thereof.”</p>

      <p>The report also indicates that when officers asked Hunt for his driver’s license, he tried to give them his passport and a credit card while his license sat on his lap. Police also claim that Hunt admitted he had been drinking alcohol “recently.”</p>
      <p>After the Grammy nominee was booked on the charges, officers released Hunt from jail at 9 a.m. – about two-and-a-half hours after his arrest – when he posted the $2,500 bond.</p>
      <p>Sam Hunt is scheduled to be in court to face the charges on January 17, 2020.</p>
