      <p>Thursday was a time for celebration as 41 new Canadians took the oath of citizenship in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>More than 120 family members and friends attended the event at the Okanagan Innovation Centre, as well as MPs and council members.</p>
      <p>Citizenship judge Carol-Ann Hart spoke about the cherished rights and freedoms Canadians enjoy, the responsibility to be loyal and faithful to Canada and being an active contributing member of the community, before leading the group through the citizenship ceremony, finishing with a rendition of O Canada. </p>
      <p>It was an emotional day for some, including one man whose parents flew over from the Netherlands to surprise him before the ceremony. Another new citizen was on the phone trying to buy a house and put down roots.</p>
      <p>Andre, his wife and two sons moved from South Africa six and a half years ago. His son Hugo says it’s a special feeling to receive citizenship in the country they love for its snow, beauty and sports. </p>
      <p>“It’s really cool to be a Canadian citizen at last. When we left South Africa, we were leaving a lot of people and we weren’t sure if it was going to work ... these six years have been hard, but we finally made it.” </p>
      <p>Deputy mayor Mohini Singh offered her congratulations and advice, speaking from her personal experience immigrating, and receiving her Canadian citizenship in 1989. </p>
      <p>"My advice to you is this – serve your community. Serve your country with your heart and your soul, however big or small that is. Anything you do, do it with an open heart, and your country will serve you well.</p>
      <p>"No bias... but you've chosen the best city and best province and best country to live in. I’m Indian, and I can tell you one of the best things about this country is that you can celebrate your traditions here, while also upholding the responsibility of Canadian citizenship.” </p>
      <p>The new citizens were welcomed with open arms and reminded by Judge Hart that strength and unity are found in diversity.</p>
      <p>"This is a place where you can be who you are – and we welcome who you are."</p>
