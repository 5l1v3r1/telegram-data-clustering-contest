      <p>BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia’s opposition parties failed to reach agreement on forming a “coalition of change” on Thursday ahead of February’s general election, complicating their goal of replacing the ruling three-party government led by the leftist Smer party that has dominated politics for the past decade.</p>
      <p>Smer has seen a slide in support since last year’s murder of an investigative journalist and his fiancee that triggered mass protests over corruption and ousted long-time prime minister Robert Fico.</p>
      <p>But his ruling coalition has survived, let by his hand-picked successor Peter Pellegrini, and the socially conservative Smer remains favorite for next year’s election.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls put at least three opposition parties just above the 5% threshold needed to get into parliament. A possible union with stronger opposition parties would increase their chances, but such a broad coalition of socially liberal and conservative groups would be volatile.</p>
      <p>Former president and leader of a new centrist party For the People Andrej Kiska was the first to announce the failure of the negotiations on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Coalitions make sense only if the support for such coalitions would be higher than the combined support for individual parties,” he told reporters, adding that some voters might see such a disparate grouping as unconvincing.</p>
      <p>The liberal Progressive Slovakia/Together, second in opinion polls, said it was disappointed with the decision by Kiska, whom they see as a natural partner after the Feb. 29 vote.</p>
      <p>Opposition parties and voters fighting what they saw as tainted system got a huge boost with the victory of a liberal, pro-EU lawyer, Zuzana Caputova, in the presidential election last year but it is far from clear this can be repeated in the parliamentary election.</p>
      <p>The opposition has ruled out cooperation with Smer or its junior coalition partners, while all parties including Smer have ruled out a coalition with the far-right People’s Party-Our Slovakia, currently the third or fourth strongest group in polls.</p>
      <p>That might lead to a post-election stalemate, leaving the likely winner, Smer, without partners to form a government.</p>
