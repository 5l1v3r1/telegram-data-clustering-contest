      <h1>The story of Frank Lampard’s season as Derby manager: from loaning Mount and Tomori to Spygate</h1>
      <h2>In our latest end of the decade piece, a look at the key moments of the Chelsea head coach’s campaign in charge at Pride Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <p>As learning curves go, it was a steep one. When Frank Lampard was appointed Derby County manager on May 31 2018, he inherited an ageing squad that had fallen short of promotion on several occasions.</p>
      <p>Something needed to change and although the Rams would endure more play-off heartache come the end of his solitary campaign at Pride Park, Lampard’s shrewd dealings in the loan market and a style of play that suited fast attackers willing to press hard paid dividends.</p>
      <p>For most external observers Derby’s 18-19 campaign will be remembered for the rivalry with Leeds United, stemming from the infamous Spygate controversy and ending with a quite amazing play-off semi-final tie.</p>
      <p>But there were other notable moments too, not least how he nurtured young players like Harry Wilson and, more importantly, the Chelsea pair of Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori.</p>
      <p>While Wilson and Mount earned more external plaudits, it was Tomori who ended up with the club's player of the season award. Seasoned observers were impressed by his ability to get team-mates out of tricky situations.</p>
      <p>Having been appointed early in the summer, Lampard was allowed plenty of time to prepare before the players started pre-season and when the campaign started properly the team immediately looked sharp.</p>
      <p>They won four of their opening six games, losing heavily to Leeds and narrowly away to Millwall, but there was a clear style of play and a sense of positivity was building.</p>
      <p>The first statement win, albeit on penalties, arrived at the end of September when the Rams went to Old Trafford and knocked Manchester United out of the Carabao Cup. They were 2-0 down before Harry Wilson scored a stunning free kick and Jack Marriott brought the game to extra time and eventually a shootout that the visitors won 8-7.</p>
      <p>Inevitably the next round saw Derby drawn away to Chelsea and Maurizio Sarri's side won 3-2 thanks to own goals from Tomori and his centre back partner Richard Keogh, but by that point a play-off push seemed inevitable.</p>
      <p>Or so supporters thought. Derby continued at pace until early December when a blip, unaided by injuries to key players, threatened to derail their play-off push.</p>
      <p>The Spygate controversy came in early January, a member of Marcelo Bielsa's staff at Leeds caught watching Derby train before their second meeting of the campaign (again won by United), midway through a run of three wins in 13.</p>

      <p>The lowest point arrived on March 2, when Aston Villa not only inflicted a third consecutive defeat but put four without reply past a seemingly rudderless Derby. "There will be a few strong words now but we have to turn it around and make it positive," Lampard told reporters afterwards.</p>
      <p>Yet the team went up another gear following that defeat and they lost just one of the final dozen games to seal a sixth-place finish, a 6-1 hammering of lowly Rotherham United among the highlights.</p>
      <p>And so to the play-offs. Leeds had suffered a dramatic collapse to finish outside of the top two and were, of course, paired with Derby.</p>
      <p>The first leg at Pride Park was keenly fought, with eight yellow cards shown by referee Craig Pawson, but the Yorkshire side brought an advantage home thanks to Kemar Roofe’s goal early in the second half.</p>
      <p>At Elland Road four days later, the success-starved Leeds fans were primed for a party. When Stuart Dallas put Bielsa’s team in front they were celebrating as if it was a done deal but Derby would not quit and Marriott, just on as a substitute, started the comeback with a helping hand from Leeds keeper Kiko Casilla. Mount and Wilson made it 3-1 on the night and 3-2 on aggregate before Dallas found the net again until Marriott’s second goal in the 85th minute sealed the Rams' unlikely progress to Wembley.</p>
      <p>Derby’s celebrations were wild and when it came to facing Villa, who had beaten West Bromwich Albion in the other semi-final at Wembley, they were second best. Dean Smith’s team won 2-1, Derby’s goal coming from Marriott late on and the fans had to soak up some more play-off misery.</p>
      <p>When Derby were approached by Chelsea in late June there was a feeling or resignation. There was a sense that the head coach was upwardly mobile before the play-off final regardless of which division Derby would be playing in and once Maurizio Sarri finally left Stamford Bridge for Juventus, the East Midlands side were powerless to stop Lampard from heading home.</p>
