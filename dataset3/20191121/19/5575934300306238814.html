      <p>Bretman Rock is asking fans to respect his privacy as he copes with the loss of his father.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the YouTuber asked his fans on Twitter to stop visiting his home in the hopes of getting a photo with him. He also addressed people who attended his father’s funeral without being invited.</p>
      <p>“Can people just let me be sad for onces,” Rock wrote on Twitter. “I’m here in the Philippines for my dad who just passed, don’t come to my house and ask me for pictures.. so many people showed up to my dads funeral uninvited and started taking pics of my dad and my family.. Like why? It’s common sense.”</p>

      <p>According to Reddit users, Rock <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/dun115/bretman_rock_is_the_pcas_beauty_influencer_of_the/">confirmed that his father had died</a> in an Instagram story that disappeared after 24 hours. His sister also shared <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4idbcxA4NG/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">an Instagram post</a> about their dad.</p>
      <h3>Multiple YouTubers have previously spoken out against fans visiting their homes and personal events</h3>
      <p>In January, the Dolan Twins asked their fans to stay away from their late father’s wake and funeral after hashtags like #SeanDolanMeetUpParty and #seandolanfuneralparty began popping up on Twitter.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6625079/YouTuber-stars-Ethan-Grayson-Dolan-beg-fans-not-come-fathers-funeral.html">the Daily Mail</a>, some people who used the hashtags actually wished to attend, while others were attempting to mock the YouTubers.</p>

      <p>David Dobrik also used social media to urge fans to stay away from his home. In June, the YouTuber appeared in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyEf4EBXe8o">a video for Architectural Digest</a>, in which he said he’s had to nail doors shut to keep uninvited guests out.</p>
      <p>“I’m trying to open this door actually because we have a lot of break-ins,” Dobrik said in the video. “We put a nail here so it doesn’t open, but it also ruins the aesthetic of the house.”</p>
      <p>The YouTuber also used his Instagram story to document what happens when fans arrive unannounced. The clips have been <a href="https://youtu.be/aGsUNTnMAZk">reshared by Awesomeness TV</a>.</p>
      <p>“Guys this is scary plz don’t come here,” Dobrik previously wrote over a video of uninvited fans. “Please stop coming to my house guys.”</p>
