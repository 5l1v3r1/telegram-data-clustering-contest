      <h1>Poll: Biden and Sanders tied nationally, followed by Warren</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:02:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are leading the Democratic presidential primary field in a new national poll, with Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) following in third place.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/november-national-poll-support-for-impeachment-declines-biden-and-sanders-lead-democratic-primary">Emerson poll</a> released Thursday found Biden and Sanders each with the support of 27 percent of Democratic primary voters, with Warren following at 20 percent support. No other candidate received double-digit support in the poll.</p>
      <p>South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> (D) was supported by 7 percent of registered voters in the poll, and entrepreneur <a href="https://thehill.com/people/andrew-yang">Andrew Yang</a> was supported by 4 percent.</p>
      <p>Sanders's support increased by 2 percentage points since October in the poll, and Warren's support decreased by 1 percentage point, while Biden's remained steady.</p>
      <p>“Biden and Sanders continue to hold their bases, which should concern Warren, as she has waited for one of the front runners to slip these past few months — yet, their support seems to be crystalizing,” Emerson Polling Director Spencer Kimball said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Sanders in recent weeks has secured key endorsements from progressives including Reps. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> (D-N.Y.), <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ilhan-omar">Ilhan Omar</a> (D-Minn.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rashida-tlaib">Rashida Tlaib</a> (D-Mich.). Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/ayanna-pressley">Ayanna Pressley</a> (D-Mass.) broke from the group of freshman lawmakers to endorse Warren.</p>
      <p>Researchers surveyed 468 Democratic primary voters Nov. 17–20. The results have a margin of error of 4.5 percentage points.</p>
      <p>More than a dozen people are vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.</p>
