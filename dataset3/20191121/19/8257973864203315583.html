      <h1>Hubble catches gamma-ray burst with highest energy yet-recorded</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:19:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:19</time> by <a rel="author">Brooks Hays</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- With the help of the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists have characterized the gamma-ray burst GRB 190114C, which featured the highest energy ever recorded.</p>
      <p>The record-setting gamma-ray burst was first spotted in January by several telescopes, including NASA's Swift and Fermi telescopes. Shortly after its discovery, several other powerful telescopes, including space-based observatories like Hubble, set out to image the powerful object in greater detail.</p>
      <p>Earlier observations suggest material ejected during the gamma-ray burst explosion reached speeds of 99.999 percent the speed of light. As this material passed through gas surrounding the collapsing star, a shock wave was produced. The shock wave triggers the burst of gamma rays measured by observatories on Earth.</p>
      <p>The newest Hubble images -- described this week <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1754-6">in the journal Nature</a> -- are helping scientists begin to figure out exactly how the collapsing cores of dying massive stars produce such high energy gamma rays.</p>
      <p>"Hubble's observations suggest that this particular burst was sitting in a very dense environment, right in the middle of a bright galaxy 5 billion light years away," study author Andrew Levan, a scientist with the Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics and Particle Physics Department of Astrophysics at Radboud University in the Netherlands, said in a news release. "This is really unusual, and suggests that might be why it produced this exceptionally powerful light."</p>
      <p>Levan and his colleagues were able to compliment Hubble's observations with those of the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope and the Atacama Large Milimeter/submilimeter Array, or ALMA.</p>
      <p>Together, the observations of the powerful observatories helped scientists confirm that the gamma-ray burst was located within an especially dense region of space -- within the so-called nuclear region of a massive galaxy. Most gamma-ray bursts are found in more sparsely populated regions of space, and scientists suspect the unusual positioning of GRB 190114C may have facilitated its record-setting energies.</p>
      <p>"Scientists have been trying to observe very-high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts for a long time," study lead study author Antonio de Ugarte Postigo of the Spain's Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia. "This new observation is a vital step forward in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts, their immediate surroundings, and just how matter behaves when it is moving at 99.999 percent of the speed of light."</p>
