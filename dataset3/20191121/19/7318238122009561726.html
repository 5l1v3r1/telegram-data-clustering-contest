      <h1>Greta Thunberg doppelgänger photo from 1898 sparks online frenzy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:03:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:03</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Hurst</a></address>
      <p>Greta Thunberg already has an impressive CV for a 16-year-old: inspiring millions to join her mission to combat climate change and telling off world leaders for not doing more.</p>
      <p>Now she's been (jokingly) credited with time travelling.</p>
      <p>A photo of Greta's double in an 1898 photograph was discovered in the archives of the University of Washington.</p>
      <p>It shows three children working on a mine in Canada.</p>
      <p>The photo quickly went viral on social networks, where some were quick to suggest shes must have time-travelled to save the world.</p>

      <p>The odd coincidence of Greta Thunberg having a doppelgänger from 1898 is only adding to the global attention she has garnered as she traverses the planet to attend climate summits, without using environmentally damaging planes.</p>
      <p>The activist is currently crossing the Atlantic on a catamaran to attend the Climate Summit in Madrid on December 2.</p>
      <p>The young activist has commented that in recent days have had to slow down the pace of the crossing due to bad weather.</p>
