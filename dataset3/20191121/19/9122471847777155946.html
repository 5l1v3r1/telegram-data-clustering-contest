      <h1>Tim Tebow Shares Heartbreaking Goodbye To His Dog</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:10:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Having a pet is one of life’s greatest pleasures, but having to say goodbye to them when they pass away brings unbearable sadness. Millions of people can empathize with what Tim Tebow is going through right now.</p>
      <p>Tebow posted a gut-wrenching video of Instagram of him spending some final minutes with his dog Bronco. Bronco crossed the ‘Rainbow Bridge’ yesterday, and was undoubtedly a very good boy.</p>
      <p>Here’s the message Tebow shared about his pup.</p>
      <blockquote>One of the toughest goodbyes. Wanted to make a special tribute to the sweetest boy ever – thank you for all the joy you brought and all the memories. Aunt Patty, thank you for loving him, and thank you to all the other people including Miss Shea and Miss Mindy for sharing so much love with Bronco. If you had the pleasure of meeting Bronco, one of the best dogs ever, I would love to hear your story.<br/><br/>Also, thank you for taking care of him every time he was sick – SEVO-Med, Blue Pearl Vet and UF Small Animal Vet Hospital (Go Gators)</blockquote>
      <p>In the video below, Tebow is visibly upset. It’s tough to watch, especially if you own a pet.</p>

      <p>Our thoughts and prayers are with Tebow, who is hurting badly right now.</p>
      <p>Rest in peace, Bronco. All dogs go to Heaven buddy.</p>
