      <p>A Colorado school district has closed 40 schools to stem the spread of two unidentified viruses that cause vomiting and fever, reports <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/us/colorado-school-district-closed-virus-outbreak/">CNN</a>. "</p>
      <p>Onset of symptoms for both types of viruses, including vomiting, is incredibly fast. The second version also causes fever in several cases," Mesa County Valley School District 51 said in a <a href="https://www.d51schools.org/news/what_s_new/all_district_51_schools_closed_nov__21-22?fbclid=IwAR0mpfESWYkzYvMxXfduKvUQ9zmjIZ5bEykZc5BCm5u5-7rbuhaBfq7UqRk">statement</a>. From the article:</p>
      <blockquote>It's the first time the Mesa County Valley School District 51 has had to close all schools due to illness, the district said Wednesday.<br/><br/>"We are taking this highly unusual action because this virus is extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools," Nursing Coordinator Tanya Marvin said in the statement.<br/><br/>More than a dozen schools in the state's 14th largest district reported increased absences "due to illness and several incidences of vomiting in public areas of the schools," according to the Mesa County Public Health Department.</blockquote>
