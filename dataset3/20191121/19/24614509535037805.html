      <p>Let’s take a closer look at the most recent Macy’s earnings report.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusted earnings per share are 74.07% worse than the 27 cents reported during the same time last year.</li>
        <li>Revenue is down 4.26% from $5.40 billion in the third quarter of 2018.</li>
        <li>Operating income of $52 million is 64.63% worse YoY from $147 million.</li>
        <li>The Macy’s earnings report also includes a net income of $2 million.</li>
        <li>That’s a 96.77% drop from net income of $62 million in the same period of the year prior.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jeff Gennette, Chairman and CEO of Macy’s, says this about the Q3 M stock earnings.</p>
      <blockquote>“After seven consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth, we experienced a deceleration in our third quarter sales. While we anticipated a negative comp as we were lapping a very strong third quarter last year, the sales deceleration was steeper than we expected.”</blockquote>
      <p>More bad news from the Macy’s earnings report comes in the form of a guidance update for 2019. The company now expects adjusted per-share earnings to range from $2.57 to $2.77 with revenue down 2.50% to 2%. Wall Street is expecting earnings per share of $2.79 for the year.</p>
