      <h1>Adobe Announces Feature Roadmap for Photoshop for iPad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:05:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/andrew-orr/" target="_blank">Andrew Orr</a></address>
      <p>Just in time after my <a href="https://www.macobserver.com/reviews/quick-look/review-photoshop-for-ipad">negative review</a>, Adobe has announced a feature roadmap for Photoshop for iPad. Here are features coming in 2019: Access all Adobe Fonts on iOS; Select Subject using machine learning; Cloud documents that will only save incremental changes to speed up the process. Here are features coming in the first half of 2020: Refine Edge; Curves and Adjustment Layer options; Brush sensitivity and Rotate Canvas; Lightroom integration.</p>
      <blockquote>Your experience, your feedback and your point of view has always been a critical part of our process, and we take that very seriously as we chart a path forward with the iPad.</blockquote>
      <p>Adobe font integration is great, but I’m not able to install fonts from outside their ecosystem.</p>
