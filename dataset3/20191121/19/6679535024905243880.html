      <h1>Sanskrit and Arabic win her laurels at Kerala Kalotsavam</h1>

      <p>Aleena M.H. is adept in both Arabic and Sanskrit. At the Revenue District School Arts Festival on Thursday, she topped with A grade in Arabic recitation and scored a first A grade in Sanskrit elocution in the higher secondary category.</p>
      <p>A Plus Two Bio-Maths student of Government Girls HSS, Cotton Hill, Aleena has been learning Sanskrit in school since Class 5. “We had the option to select Malayalam or Sanskrit in school. I went for Sanskrit so that I could learn one more language,” says Aleena, daughter of Mohammed Haneefa and Subaida, both government employees.</p>
      <p>This is not the first time that Aleena has participated in the festival. In her high school years, she had taken part in Sanskrit drama and Samasya Pooranam events. Reading school texts thoroughly and teachers’ explanations in class have helped her tremendously, not to mention her appearances in the Samasya Pooranam events. “It is not easy at first. But constant practice pays,” she says.</p>
      <p>Shifting to elocution too involved written practice. Teachers too lent essay books to increase her vocabulary.</p>
      <p>As she sets forth to pursue career goals, Aleena can look back fondly at the rewards of the hard work she put in.</p>
