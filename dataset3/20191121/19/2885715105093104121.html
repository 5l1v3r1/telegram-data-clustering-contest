      <h1>Bankers expect many suitors for DHFL; stock climbs 5%</h1>
      <h2>State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters that many suitors are expected for DHFL as “it’s a good franchise”.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:54:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/ens-economic-bureau/" target="_blank">ENS Economic Bureau</a></address>
      <p>A day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) superseded the board of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) and initiated bankruptcy proceedings, bankers said the firm is likely to attract many suitors for the takeover of the debt-ridden firm.</p>
      <p>DHFL shares, which had plunged 92 per cent over the last year, rose 5 per cent to Rs 21.15 on Thursday, with markets speculating on the interest of some big corporate houses to take control of the company through the bankruptcy process.</p>
      <p>State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters that many suitors are expected for DHFL as “it’s a good franchise”. However, he did not name any particular corporate house. “There is a 330-day timeline that is also extended timeline. Otherwise, normally it should happen in 180 days that is the intent of the (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) process. So, let us hope that those timelines are adhered to and let us hope for the best,” he said. SBI has an exposure of Rs 7,000 crore in DHFL.</p>
      <p>However, bankers said a clear picture will emerge only when the financial position of the housing finance firm emerges through the IBC process in the coming days. “The liabilities of DHFL are huge. It is to be seen whether suitors will come forward with a proposal which is suitable to the lenders. How much haircut the lenders will accept is also to be seen,” said a banking source. “There was speculation in the market that the Adanis, Piramals and Apollo would be interested in DHFL,” said a dealer with a brokerage house.</p>
      <p>Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi had said mutual funds would also join the resolution process of DHFL, which would be done under the framework of the insolvency law. DHFL owes more than Rs 38,000 crore to banks towards long-term, short-term loans and NCDs. What is worrying bankers are reports about fund diversion by DHFL. Audit firm KPMG, which carried out the forensic audit of DHFL, has reportedly found instances of fund diversion of over Rs 19,000 crore of bank loans to DHFL’s related entities. While DHFL promoters, the Wadhawans, hold 39.21 per cent stake in the company, foreign investors hold 9.48 per cent stake.</p>
      <p>RBI on Wednesday said it would take the company to the National Company Law Tribunal to chalk out a rescue package or liquidation for DHFL which defaulted on repayments to banks, mutual funds and retail investors.</p>
      <p>“The Reserve Bank also intends to shortly initiate the process of resolution of the company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 and would also apply to the NCLT for appointing the Administrator as the Insolvency Resolution Professional,” the central bank said.</p>
      <p>The RBI, which stepped in after the lenders and the company failed to work out a resolution plan to bring the firm back on the rails, appointed R Subramaniakumar, former MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank, as the administrator to run DHFL’s affairs.</p>
      <p>“The statutory inspection of DHFL conducted by the National Housing Bank (NHB) under Section 34 of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 with reference to its position as on March 31, 2018 revealed serious deterioration in its financial position,” the RBI said in its order. “DHFL has defaulted in its payment obligations in respect of bank borrowings and market borrowings, which reveals serious concerns about the conduct of the affairs of the company,” it added.</p>
      <p>DHFL had a loan portfolio of Rs 91,930 crore as on March 31, 2018. Incorporated in 1984, DHFL is among the large size housing finance companies in India with total asset size of Rs 1,07,436 crore as on March 31, 2018.</p>
