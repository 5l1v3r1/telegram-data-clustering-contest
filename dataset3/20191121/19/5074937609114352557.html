      <h1>Ghanaians must know more about District level elections</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:53:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:53</time> by <a rel="author">Khareema Thompson GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 21, GNA - Ghanaians need to know more about the December 17 polls and referendum before they can make informed decisions, Mr Frank Amoah has stated.</p>
      <p>“Even before the election day, two different political parties have taken entrenched positions and this is the thing to guard against to deepen our democratic credentials,” He added.</p>
      <p>Mr Amioah, who was speaking to the Ghana News Agency on the forthcoming elections and referendum for future election of MMDCEs said there was the need for government to step up education on the exercise.</p>
      <p>The upcoming Local Level Election on December 17, per the 1992 constitution requires about 40 percent of qualified Ghanaian voters. And out of the 40 percent, 75 percent of voters agreeing to the yes or no will affirm the amendment of the clause.</p>
      <p>The referendum is for the citizenry to decide if whether district-level, districts assemblies or lower local governments units elections must be based on partisanship or not.</p>
      <p>“The yes or no vote today, will determine how the subsequent elections of the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) will be.</p>
      <p>“The debate on the referendum is that ‘are you in favour of the bill to amend Clause 3 of Article 55 of the 1992 Constitution to allow political parties to sponsor the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) candidates at election stage,or not.”</p>
      <p>Mr Amoah said there was no need to vote against the referendum and “I am certain the political affiliations will straighten up development and prevent delays in some challenges we face in the community” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Joseph Ashong, a student of UPSA said,“ If district election is going to be on a partisan basis , I believe development will turn to be shallow to the state and enrich politicians rather. We don’t want this kind of law”, So Iam not in support of the yes”.</p>
      <p>John Oquaye, a trader said; “If the MMDCES will now be sponsored by political parties, it will allow policy makers to demonstrate, to the state what they are competent in doing. This might in the early stages, call for some confrontations, but we can get a better side of it through good policies”.</p>
      <p>Some complained, they were not aware of the coming referendum, while others had no understanding of the referendum.</p>
      <p>The Ghanaian fundamental law, Article 243 (1) of the 1992 constitution bill states that, the President is to appoint Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) to Parliament.</p>
      <p>In relation to that, amending Article 55 (3) would also pave the way for political parties to sponsor candidates for elections of the MMDCEs and the Assembly Members.</p>
