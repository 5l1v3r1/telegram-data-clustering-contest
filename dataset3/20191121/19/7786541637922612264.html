      <p><b>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP)</b> - University students in Venezuela have staged a protest calling for an end to President Nicolás Maduro's rule.</p>
      <p>A few hundred students on Thursday marched several blocks from the Central University of Venezuela campus in Caracas, but a National Guard blockade cut short their goal of reaching the city's main military base.</p>
      <p>Opposition leader Juan Guaidó has called for sustained demonstrations to pressure Maduro from power. The opposition has failed to create momentum and draw large numbers.</p>
      <p>Students are calling on the military to abandon Maduro and join their fight to end the nation's economic and political crisis.</p>
      <p>The march Thursday ended peacefully with student leaders handing a petition to military commanders.</p>
      <p>Maduro's ruling socialist party held its own rival student march.</p>
