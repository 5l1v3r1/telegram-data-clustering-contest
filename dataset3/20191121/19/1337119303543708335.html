      <h1>Apple removes customer reviews from its online store</h1>
      <h2>It happened over the weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:34:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters" target="_blank">Jay Peters</a></address>
      <p>Apple has removed customer reviews from its online store, as first <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/21/apple-pulls-all-customer-reviews-from-online-apple-store">reported by <i>AppleInsider</i></a>, and we’ve confirmed this to be the case. <i>AppleInsider</i> got a tip from a reader that the reviews had been removed from the US, UK, and Australian Apple Stores (which we have also confirmed).</p>
      <p>If you want to see the changes for yourself, you can look at the Wayback Machine archives for the original Apple Pencil for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191116152646/https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0C2AM/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation">November 16th</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191117213629/https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0C2AM/A/apple-pencil-1st-generation">November 17th</a>, as found by <i>AppleInsider.</i> On the November 17th capture, you can see that the “Ratings &amp; Reviews” section is gone.</p>
      <p>Apple’s choice means that customers can’t provide useful feedback on the products available on Apple’s store — especially if a product might be bad. There were at least 735 one-star reviews for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191029120649/https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMX62AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter">the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack adapter</a>, for example, but now you can’t tell if it’s good or not just by looking at that page.</p>
      <p>We’ve asked Apple for comment and will update this story with anything we hear back.</p>
