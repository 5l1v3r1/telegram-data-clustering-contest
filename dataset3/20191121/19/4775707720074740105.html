      <h4>Darksiders III</h4>
      <p>Darksiders III is an action-adventure game about FURY, a mage and one of the Four Horsemen. Her task is to eliminate each of the Seven Deadly Sins, who are rampaging around Earth and threatening Armageddon. FURY has various forms, each of which equip her with new moves and weapons, and she'll need them; to get to the Seven Deadly Sins, she has to go through their servants.</p>

      <h4>Subnautica</h4>
      <p>Subnautica is a sandbox survival game. Your Life Pod has crashed into the ocean of an alien planet; you have to find food, (drinkable) water, and all the equipment you'll need to stay alive; but to do that, you need to venture out into the ocean. Oxygen levels make each expedition tense, and there are creatures in the dark waiting for you to drop your guard.</p>

      <h4>Vambrace: Cold Soul</h4>
      <p>Vambrace: Cold Soul is a roguelite RPG. It's sort of similar to Subnautica in that each journey from underground to the dangerous city surface of Icenaire have to be methodically planned, but there the similarities end. The King of Shades is responsible for the curse on the city, keeping it permanently frozen. The dead have risen again as an army of Wraiths, and those that survived must look for shelter underground. The player-character is Evelia Lyric. She and her Aetherbrace must journey into Icenaire and take down the King of Shades.</p>

      <h4>Munchkin: Quacked Quest</h4>
      <p>Munchin: Quacked Quest is an action game, and a bizarre one at that. Ducks are collected, people are thrown into sacrifice pits whether they're your friends or not, and a wide range of enemies abound, including reanimated skeletons and the Plutonium Dragon. There's also a weapon called the Rat-on-a-Stick.</p>

      <h4>The Red Strings Club</h4>
      <p>Did I say Munchkin Quacked Quest was bizarre? In The Red Strings Club, you'll be going up against the Supercontinent Ltd, a corporation looking to brainwash everyone with Social Psyche Welfare; a system which will apparently remove depression, anger, and fear. It sounds a little like the Joy in We Happy Few. And you'll apparently be doing this through a mix of pottery, bartending, and impersonation. Of course.</p>

      <h4>Life is Strange 2 - Episode 4</h4>
      <p>The fourth episode of Life is Strange 2 is about Sean. He wakes up in hospital in Nevada, under arrest, and with no idea where Daniel is. He has to find a way to get to freedom, and to begin looking for Daniel. The fourth episode has a completion time of about 2-3 hours, according to our site, and nine achievements for a total of 190 Gamerscore.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres â€” when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
