      <p>The fifth edition of the ‘Vizag Going Pink’ run, popularly known as ‘Pinkathon’, will be organised on Beach Road on December 8. The women-only run aims at creating awareness on women’s health and promoting a healthy lifestyle for prevention of diseases.</p>
      <p>Actor and fitness enthusiast Milind Soman, who is the ambassador for the ‘Pinkathon’, was in the city on Thursday to promote the event that will be held in 3km, 5km and 10km categories. ‘Pinkathon’ was started in Mumbai in 2012 and subsequently moved to other cities such as Bengaluru, Chennai and Visakhapatnam.</p>
      <p>“It is a memorable journey which inspired thousands of women to choose a healthy lifestyle. Running makes the mind stronger and drives out negativity,” Mr. Milind told the media here on Thursday.</p>
