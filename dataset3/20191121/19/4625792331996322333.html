      <h1>'When the hell are they going to f---ing call on me?': Yang furious at MSNBC over speaking time</h1>

      <p>Democratic presidential contender <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/meet-the-44-year-old-democrat-whos-running-for-president-to-stave-off-unemployment-riots">Andrew Yang</a> ripped into MSNBC for the amount of speaking time he got during the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-democratic-presidential-debate">fifth Democratic primary debate</a>.</p>
      <p>"It felt great," Yang said about the Wednesday night debate before taking aim at the network. "But then it felt like when the hell are they going to f---ing call on me? The hypocrisy of MSNBC in a way just makes us stronger."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/who-is-andrew-yang">Yang</a>'s campaign has accused MSNBC of being biased against his campaign as the network regularly will leave him off graphics showing 2020 candidates, despite being a top-six candidate in polling, according to RealClearPolitics.</p>
      <p>The tech entrepreneur came in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/20/us/elections/debate-speaking-time.html">last</a> place in speaking time during the 10-person debate with less than seven minutes of speaking time. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren got the most speaking time with 13.5 minutes. Yang did not get a question in the debate until 30 minutes into the two-hour event.</p>
      <p>Fellow 2020 contender Tulsi Gabbard took aim at MSNBC on Twitter for not giving Yang more time. "So much for the promise of equal time for all candidates, @AndrewYang got half the time as the usual media favorites. Typical," the Hawaii representative said.</p>
