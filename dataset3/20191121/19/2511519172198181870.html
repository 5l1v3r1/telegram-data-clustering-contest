      <p>The RSPCA’s “loneliest” cat is facing a second consecutive Christmas alone after no one adopted him in 2019. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/findapet/details/-/Animal/TOBY/ref/BSA2084946/rehome">Toby</a>, an 11-year-old black and white cat, has spent 322 days with the RSPCA after being taken in by their Canterbury branch on Christmas Eve 2018. </p>
      <p>It normally takes just 28 days for a cat to be rehomed. </p>
      <p>Toby was rescued from a home of 46 cats, of which 15 were cared for by the RSPCA.</p>
      <p>However, while his former housemates were adopted,Toby has not been so lucky, partly due to his shy nature.</p>
      <p>“Toby’s former housemates were re-homed quite quickly,” explained Beth Hixson from the RSPCA Canterbury branch.</p>
      <p>“But poor Toby didn’t cope well with being in the cattery so hid away and wouldn’t come out to see people when they came to choose a cat. </p>
      <p>“We found a foster home for Toby where he has proven to be a sociable, friendly and interactive cat,” she added.</p>
      <p>“He loves to snuggle up on the bed at night and spend sunny days exploring the garden, he just needs to find a home where he can enjoy doing this for the rest of his days.”</p>
      <p>The RSPCA typically takes in more than 1<a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/winterappeal">0,000 vulnerable animals</a> during the winter.</p>
      <p>In 2018, there was a 28 per cent increase in calls to the charity’s cruelty line on Christmas day, with<a href="https://news.rspca.org.uk/2019/11/12/rspca-received-more-than-2200-calls-about-needy-animals-in-wales-last-christmas/"> 934 reports made</a> - the highest figure recorded since 2014.</p>
