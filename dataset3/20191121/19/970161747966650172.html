      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lucifer/">Lucifer</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tom-ellis/">Tom Ellis</a> hinted that Lucifer and Chloe are going to get their happily ever after.</p>
      <p>Season four saw the pair confess their feelings for each other, and despite being ripped apart once more, Deckerstar shippers are going to get their wish.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.etonline.com/lucifer-tom-ellis-and-lauren-german-on-if-a-lucifer-and-chloe-wedding-is-coming-in-season-5-136545">In an interview with Entertainment Tonight</a>, Tom, who plays the titular character, hinted at a ‘happy ending’ for the lovebirds.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘I think my favorite stories have always been stories that the message at the end is hope, and so we’re pushing towards that on this.’</p>
      <p>Lucifer’s fifth and final season <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/lucifer-season-5-confirmed-split-two-fans-essentially-get-season-6-fighting-11001702/">will be split into two 8-episode parts</a>, essentially giving Lucifans the sixth season they so desperately wanted.</p>
      <p>One episode that’s sure to be a standout <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/lucifer-star-tom-ellis-gives-off-singin-rain-vibes-teases-season-5-musical-episode-bts-vid-10991187/">is a musical episode</a>, set in an alternate universe from the 1940s and shot entirely in black and white.</p>

      <p>‘I would say on this episode, we take a trip down memory lane with Lucifer,’ Tom spilled to Entertainment Weekly about the musical. ‘We tell a story that answers the question a lot of fans have been asking actually.</p>

      <p>‘The lovely thing about this episode is you see a lot of our regular characters in a different light. There’s an element to Lucifer where he seems to be from the Oscar Wilde period. And to see the other characters fall back into that style is quite interesting.’</p>
      <p>There’s also a chance that none other than singer Kelly Clarkson might make an appearance, as she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/lucifer-superfan-kelly-clarkson-visits-tom-ellis-set-teases-season-5-surprise-10973127/">recently spotted on set</a> and is a massive fan of the show.</p>
