      <p>Everyone deserves to feel welcome and celebrated in their community. </p>
      <p>That's the idea behind the Dragonfly Pond Family Society's annual Uniquely Fashionable Fashion Show, running next week. </p>
      <p>The show features not professional models, but kids and youth with disabilities or complex care needs, getting the chance to shine on the runway and aiming to show them the community of Penticton loves and accepts them. </p>
      <p>"The entire family is supported and uplifted by this event," said program coordinator Tricia Hernes. "This year, we have 43 models, some of them are children or youth and also siblings as well that are participating."</p>
      <p>The society fundraises during the year to pay for the event, to purchase the clothes for the models and book the space so that the families can participate at zero cost. They also work with The Bay to have a try-on night, where the kids get to shop and pick out the outfit they want to model. </p>
      <p>"I think for a lot of the parents, when they go out in the community, they feel a little judged or self-conscious," Hernes. "So it's an incredibly uplifting night for those parents because they feel that love and that warmth from the community, which is something they don't always feel." </p>
      <p>The kids also get a special experience. </p>
      <p>"It's incredible, sometimes you see these kids and they're so shy, and they're in a shell, and they get on that stage and see everyone lighting up and cheering them on and clapping, and they come out of that shell," Hernes described.</p>
      <p>"They'll throw down a move to the music that's playing for them and they just have light from within, it's so incredible to see them blossom in this environment."</p>
      <p>The event takes place Thursday, Nov. 28 at the Lakeside Resort, and involves a cocktail reception, silent auction, raffle, dance show and the fashion show. </p>
      <p>Tickets are $25 each and are available online <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/the-uniquely-fashionable-fashion-show-tickets-71408281091?aff=ebdssbdestsearch">here</a> or by contacting Hernes at 250-490-3305 or dragonfly@vip.net.</p>
