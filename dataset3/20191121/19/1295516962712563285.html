          <b>WARNING: This article contains major spoilers for "Prochnost," the latest episode of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/arrow/">Arrow</a> Season 8.</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>For a while now, we have known that although <i>Arrow</i> may be reaching its conclusion after eight seasons, the title superhero's legacy will live on in a spinoff series. <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/green-arrow-and-the-canaries/"><i>Green Arrow and the Canaries</i></a> will see Oliver Queen's daughter Mia Smoak take the mantle from her father, and fight alongside Laurel Lance and Dinah Drake as the protectors of Star City.</p>
      <p>Recently, executive producer Marc Guggenheim confirmed the <a href="https://screenrant.com/arrowverse-characters-deserve-spinoff/amp/">spinoff series</a> would take place in the year 2040, where Mia hails from. Furthermore, it's been confirmed that <i>Arrow</i>'s penultimate episode will work as a sort of backdoor pilot, and focus on Mia, Laurel, and Dinah.</p>

      <p>However, that hasn't stopped <i>Arrow</i> from setting the stage for the upcoming <i>Green Arrow and the Canaries</i>. In fact, in the series' latest episode, "Prochnost," Oliver prepares his daughter to take on the Green Arrow mantle -- they just don't know it yet.</p>

      <p>In Season 7 of <i>Arrow</i>, we learned that Mia Smoak was trained by Nyssa Al Ghul in both hand-to-hand combat and archery. She used the skills she learned in 2040, as she fought alongside her brother, Connor and more heroes to save Star City from a grim fate. But while Mia is certainly a capable fighter, she's no superhero. At least, not yet. However, all of that changed when the Monitor plucked Mia, William, and Connor from the future and dropped them into the present, where they met their parents.</p>
      <p>Now, in "Prochnost," Oliver begins to teach Mia everything he knows, from his skills to his tricks, to help her become a better vigilante. It all starts when he introduces her to a crucial exercise: shooting bouncing tennis balls with arrows. Fans of the series know that this particular move has been a signature of sorts for <i>Arrow</i> ever since its pilot. With this classic move, Oliver refines his daughter's technique, accuracy, and skills. Then, he continues by showing her the vast array of trick arrows at his disposal. From explosive projectiles to rope arrows that can subdue enemies, Mia begins to use these weapons in the field as practice through a series of montages.</p>

      <p>And it doesn't stop there. Later, Oliver spars with his daughter with fighting sticks, much in the same way that he learned from Slade Wilson on Lian Yu. Oliver kept this particular training exercise going with John Diggle, and now he's passing on that skill to his daughter.</p>
      <p>Throughout the episode, Oliver shows Mia every major technique the Green Arrow uses. To them, it's just father and daughter spending time together, and helping her become a more refined fighter. But we fans know the truth: Oliver is grooming her to become his successor, even if he doesn't know it yet.</p>
      <p>This way, when Mia becomes the star of her own series, she will have all the building blocks that made her father the superhero that he was. Better yet, these techniques will help keep the spirit of <i>Arrow</i> alive -- as well as Oliver's legacy.</p>
