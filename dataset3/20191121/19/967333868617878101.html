      <p>A cute shiba inu, aptly named Charmy, has been filmed while being brushed by her owner on the head. Evidently, the brush hit the right spot, as the doggy <a href="https://sputniknews.com/videoclub/201911191077348581-head-massage-anyone-shiba-inu-enjoys-high-tech-relax/">is seen</a> in an extremely blissful state, squinting with its eyes in pleasure.</p>
      <p>Charmy was also lucky enough to have her chest and belly brushed, which was seemingly equally enjoyable for her, as she is seen with her mouth wide open, smiling happily.</p>
