      <h1>Mustang Mach-E Gets The Ken Block Treatment In New Video</h1>
      <h2>Sadly, it's not the silent Gymkhana 11 preview we were hoping for.</h2>

      <p>Did you hear the news? <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/">Ford</a> has a new electric crossover called the<a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mach-e/"> Mustang Mach-E</a>. Okay, you <i>probably</i> heard that news, and if you watched <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/382695/ford-mustang-mach-e-livestream/">Ford’s livestream of the historic reveal </a>ahead of the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/auto-show/la-auto-show/">LA Auto Show</a>, you saw a short clip featuring some notable Ford-friendly celebrities sampling the Mach-E. Among them was <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/ken-block/">Ken Block</a>, who recently released a very different Ford-themed video featuring his twin-turbocharged, 914-horsepower<a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/383048/ken-block-climbkhana-two-video/"> F-150 Hoonitruck climbing a mountain in China</a>.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, this clip isn’t nearly as exciting. It does, however, offer an interesting behind-the-scenes look at the new Mach-E through the eyes of someone who most decidedly has one of the most radical Mustangs ever built. Block visited Ford’s Dearborn Proving Grounds a few weeks ahead of the Mach-E’s debut for some PR work, and while he was there, he took a close look at a couple of the prototypes. More importantly for our purposes, he drove one of the prototypes. And what does Ken Block usually do behind the wheel of a car?</p>

      <p>Despite the question posed in the video title, Block is <i>not</i> allowed to hoon the Mach-E. The Ford buzzkills gave him explicit instructions to not even generate any tire noise, never mind get sideways. That’s too bad, because right now enthusiasts around the world – and especially Mustang fans – are blowing a gasket over this four-door crossover bearing the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/mustang/">Mustang</a> name. What better way to address those detractors than to let Mr. Hoonigan himself rip some smoky donuts in the Mach-E?</p>

      <p>The GT Performance version of the Mach-E should be capable of such tomfoolery. Ford says it will develop 459 horsepower and turn all four wheels, sending the crossover to 60 mph in the mid-three-second range. The downside? The GT is still a long way off – it won’t arrive until later in 2021 – and it will cost over $60,000.</p>

      <p>Block ultimately gives his approval to the Mach-E, though with Ford being one of his major sponsors it’s hard to imagine him saying anything <i>bad</i> about it. As for the rest of the world, there’s a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/383490/mustang-expert-petition-change-mach-e/">petition to change the Mach-E’s name</a> with thousands of signatures in less than 24 hours, and the controversy over the Mustang branding seems to overshadow the fact that this looks like a legitimately good crossover.</p>

      <p>Did Ford make a mistake calling this a Mustang, or is it a smart, gutsy move? Only time will tell.</p>
