      <p>The Coimbatore District (Rural) Police have formed seven teams to investigate the burglary in which 63 sovereigns of jewellery and ₹ 6.3 lakh were stolen from the house of a contractor near Thudiyalur on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The police said the fingerprint bureau managed to develop two fingerprints that were suspected to be that of the burglars from a shelf and a door of the house.</p>
      <p>The burglary took place in the house of K. Kanagaraj at Luna Nagar between 3.30 p.m. and 7.30 p.m. when the family had gone out.</p>
      <p>The police said the house had many advanced security features including anti-theft alarm system and surveillance camera network. “The anti-theft alarm system did not operate as it was not connected to power at the time of the burglary. The burglars took away the digital video recorder of the surveillance camera network,” said a police officer who is part of the investigation.</p>
      <p>A sniffer dog ran for around 300 m north-west of the house and stopped in front of an apartment.</p>
      <p>The special teams collected feeds from road facing surveillance cameras in the locality on Thursday.</p>
