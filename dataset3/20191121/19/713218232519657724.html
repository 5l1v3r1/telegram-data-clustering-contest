      <p>The Dorrigo Visual Arts Group has again been delighted with the outstanding quality of work presented for the 2019 show on November 20. The annual show is the culmination of not only the artists' work but also by the many DVAG members and supporters who now work as a well-oiled team.</p>
      <p>A large crowd of about 100 people attended the evening event. Problems with bushfires and smoke no doubt made some hesitant to venture out but within the crowd the mood reflected a need to socialise and be with others in difficult times.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, our judge Barbara Mckay was unable to drive to Dorrigo as the road near Ebor had been closed by RFS. However, two of our local artists, Sandra Pitkin and Peter Mortimore, stepped up to the challenging task of judging then providing feedback to the artists during the evening prize giving.</p>
