      <p>Learn about the stories behind the buildings of Bampton with a new exhibition at Tiverton Museum.</p>
      <p>The Tiverton Museum of Mid Devon Life begins the exhibition following collaboration with the Bampton Heritage and Visitor Centre. The exhibition features research by Bampton Heritage Centre and photographs and archives from Tiverton Museum’s collection.</p>
      <p>Earlier this autumn, the Heritage Centre produced a series of exhibition boards celebrating the town’s historic buildings.</p>
      <p>The Bampton project, known as ‘Our Buildings’, was partly funded by a grant from the National Lottery Heritage fund and was undertaken over the previous year by some of the Heritage Centre’s volunteers. They researched when, why and how some of the town’s most interesting buildings were built.</p>
      <p>Appeals were made in the Tiverton Gazette for old photographs and memories of people who recalled buildings such as the Methodist Church and the White Horse Inn. Outcomes of the project also include a printed church guide, oral history recordings and a self-led family town trail quiz which are available from the Bampton centre, based inside the town’s church.</p>
      <p>Katrina Munro, the chair of the Bampton Heritage Centre said: “After a well-received exhibition in Bampton during September and October, we’re delighted that the displays can now be shared with a wider audience – the visitors to the Tiverton Museum.</p>
      <p>“We have many attractive and historic buildings here, and we hope that the exhibition will encourage people to come to our town to see all that it has to offer and increase their understanding of architectural styles and local history. Once a month we hold guided Bampton town trails, but there is also now a fun self-led family town trial quiz which can be found on our website.”</p>
      <p>Pippa Griffith, Director of Tiverton Museum, said: “We are delighted to host this fascinating exhibition which contains a wealth of information about the history of Bampton. We greatly enjoyed looking through our collection and adding Bampton items to the exhibition. We have also compiled a digital screen featuring about 90 historic photographs of the town</p>
      <p>The temporary exhibition has free entry and is at Tiverton Museum until January 25.</p>
