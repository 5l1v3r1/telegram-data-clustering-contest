      <h1>If a 49-inch super-wide monitor is too big, try this 43-inch model on for size</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:16:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/paul-lilly/" target="_blank">Paul Lilly</a></address>
      <p>Not everyone has room for a 49-inch super-wide monitor, so Philips has come out with a 'smaller' <a href="https://www.philips.co.uk/c-p/439P9H_00/brilliance-3210-superwide-curved-lcd-display">43-inch version</a>. Problem solved!</p>
      <p>Okay, maybe not—if you're short on space, a 43-inch monitor is probably still too big. But for those who can fit one onto their desk (or wherever else), the new 439P9H brings a super-wide (aka, doublewide) form factor into the fold at a slightly less massive scale than the crop of 49-inch monitors, including the 492P8 that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/philips-is-giving-its-insanely-wide-49-inch-monitor-a-resolution-bump/">Philips introduced last year</a>.</p>
      <p>The smaller 43-inch model is also touting a curved (1800R) VA panel like its bigger sibling, albeit with a 3840x1200 resolution (32:10 aspect ratio). It's also somewhat fast, boasting a 100Hz refresh rate (with adaptive sync support) and 4ms gray-to-gray response time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Panel type—VA</li>
        <li>Panel size—43.4 inches</li>
        <li>Resolution—3840x1200</li>
        <li>Refresh rate—100Hz</li>
        <li>Response time—4ms (GtG)</li>
        <li>Brightness—450 nits</li>
        <li>Contrast ratio—3,000:1 typical, 80,000,000:1 dynamic</li>
        <li>Viewing angles—178 degrees vertical, 178 degrees horiztonal</li>
        <li>Color gamut—105 percent NTSC, 123 percent sRGB, 91 percent Adobe RGB</li>
        <li>HDR—DisplayHDR 400 certified</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This monitor is DisplayHDR 400 certified, meaning it meets the requirements for VESA's entry-level HDR certification tier. With a brightness rating of 450 nits, though, it's not likely to deliver anywhere near the same HDR experience as a monitor with a 1,000 nits brightness capability (which is where HDR content really shines on LCD panels).</p>
      <p>While not built specifically for gaming, Philips definitely has gamers in its sights.</p>
      <p>"Gaming shouldn't be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any framerate with adaptive sync technology, smooth quick refresh, and ultra-fast response time," Philips says.</p>
      <p>Beyond the marketing spin, the 100Hz refresh rate and 4ms response time are certainly respectable. The high color gamut also stands out.</p>
      <p>Connectivity options include two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, an HDMI 2.0b port, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C ports (one upstream and one downstream with power delivery up to 90W), four USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, a headphone jack, and a GbE LAN port. The extra ports and Ethernet are because the display can act as a single connection docking station.</p>
      <p>The Philips 439P9H monitor will be available later this month for £879. There's also no word on when it will ship in the US or how much it will cost when it does. Either way, we don't expect there to be any <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday deals</a> featuring this specific models (though there will be on other monitors, as there is every year).</p>
