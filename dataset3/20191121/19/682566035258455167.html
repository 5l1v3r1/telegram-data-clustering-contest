      <p>New Delhi - <b>Indian</b> cricket captain <b>Virat Kohli</b> will return to lead the team for three Twenty20 internationals and three ODI matches against the West Indies starting next month, national selectors announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>Besides star batsman Kohli, fast bowlers Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and spin-bowling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja have also made a comeback to India's T20 squad.</p>
      <p>Wicketkeeper-batsman Sanju Samson and pacers Khaleel Ahmed and Shardul Thakur, who were part of India's squad against Bangladesh, were left out.</p>
      <p>Senior batsman Rohit Sharma captained the Twenty20 team in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in Kohli's absence.</p>
      <p>Many critics expected Indian selectors to make several other changes in the squad including Samson getting an extended run.</p>
      <p>Samson, a wicketkeeper and top-order batsman, is seen by many as a possible replacement for India's out-of-form wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant.</p>
      <p>India and West Indies will play their first match on December 6 in Mumbai.</p>
      <p>The final game of the tour will be played in Cuttack on December 22.</p>
      <p>India are expected to try many new line-ups in the shortest format of the game over the next few months to prepare their squad for the T20 World Cup next year.</p>
      <p><b>T20 squad: </b>Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma (vice-captain), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant (wicketkeeper), Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Deepak Chahar, Mohammed Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar</p>
