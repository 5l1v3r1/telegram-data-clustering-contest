      <h1>Update On T.Y. Hilton Ahead Of Tonight’s Game vs. Texans</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:58:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>T.Y. Hilton has missed the Colts’ last three contests due to a calf injury. But things are trending in the right direction for Hilton – and it looks like there’s a strong chance he plays against the Texans on Thursday Night Football.</p>
      <p>James Palmer of NFL Network reports Hilton <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesPalmerTV/status/1197595337772478467">“believes he’s good to go”</a> against Houston tonight. This would be a massive boost for the Indianapolis offense.</p>
      <p>According to Palmer, the Colts “don’t have any issue with him not practicing and playing.” Houston is also expecting Hilton to play tonight.</p>

      <p>We’ll have to wait and see until later tonight whether or not the receiver will be available to play. Indianapolis is hoping Hilton can play against the Texans.</p>
      <p>Tonight’s contest is a pivotal AFC South Division match-up. The Colts are currently in first place in the division and have the No. 3 seed in the AFC Playoff picture. But Houston is not so far behind.</p>
      <p>In fact, both the Texans and Colts share the same record at 6-4. But Indianapolis holds the tie-breaker due to their 30-23 victory over Houston in Week 7. The Texans can take the division lead on Thursday night with a win.</p>
      <p>Texans-Colts kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET on FOX and NFL Network.</p>
