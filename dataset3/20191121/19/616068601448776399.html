      <p>Thursday was a time for celebration as 41 new Canadians took the oath of citizenship in Kelowna.</p>
      <p>More than 120 family members and friends attended the event at the Okanagan Innovation Centre, as well as MPs and council members.</p>
      <p>Citizenship judge Carol-Ann Hart spoke about the cherished rights and freedoms Canadians enjoy, the responsibility to be loyal and faithful to Canada and being an active contributing member of the community, before leading the group through the citizenship ceremony, finishing with a rendition of O Canada. </p>
