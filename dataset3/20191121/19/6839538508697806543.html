      <p>The royal family is reportedly not speaking to Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, despite them opening up about their struggles in a new documentary.</p>
      <p>A source has told <a href="https://people.com/royals/prince-harry-and-meghan-markles-relationship-with-royal-family-remains-tense-after-documentary/"><i>People </i></a>magazine that “No one” in the family is “checking in, texting or speaking to” the couple.</p>

      <p>“Nothing has changed. They don’t speak, no one is checking in, no one is texting,” the source said.</p>
      <p>It comes after the royal couple opened up in a documentary last month about their struggles with constant media attention.</p>
      <p>When asked if she was OK during the documentary, Meghan gave a heartbreaking answer.</p>
      <p>“Not many people have asked if I’m OK … it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes,” she said. “It’s not enough to just survive something, that’s not the point of life. You have got to thrive.”</p>

      <p>Prince Harry went a step further and confirmed speculation of a falling out with his brother, Prince William, saying “we are on different paths at the moment”.</p>
      <p>Prince William and his wife, Kate, reportedly checked in after the documentary aired to make sure the couple was OK but the People source says they have now gone back to not communicating.</p>
      <p>“There hasn’t been this complete 180,” they said.</p>
      <p>Prince Harry and Meghan commenced a six-week break from royal duties earlier this week and will spend thanksgiving and Christmas with the duchess’ mother, Doria Ragland.</p>
      <p>Despite initial suggestions that Princes William and Harry would become a sort of royal “fab four” with their wives, Prince Harry and Meghan left the Royal Foundation the quartet had establish earlier this year to set up their own charitable foundation.</p>
      <p>It came after Prince Harry and Meghan moved out of Kensington Palace, where Prince William and Kate live and into Frogmore Cottage.</p>
