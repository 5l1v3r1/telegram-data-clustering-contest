      <p>The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will focus on the city's rejuvenating efforts following recent disasters.</p>
      <p>After a morning visit to a marae - or Maori meeting house - the trio will head to Cashmere High School, which lost three students in the March 15 mosque attacks, to meet with staff and pupils.</p>
      <p>They will then attend a reception at Christ Church Cathedral, the striking city centre building almost damaged beyond repair in the 2011 earthquakes and since then has become Christchurch's beacon of regeneration.</p>
      <p>Cantabrians will have the chance to meet their royal highnesses in a public walk around Cathedral Square, before the pair split for afternoon activities.</p>

      <p>The Duchess will take in the newly-opened Riverside Market and a Salvation Army group, while the Prince gives an environmental address at Lincoln University.</p>
      <p>Despite the tumult surrounding the royal family, which has intensified this week with Charles' brother Andrew taking an indefinite back seat from public life, the tour has taken place without drama or incident.</p>
      <p>A far smaller group of New Zealanders have engaged with the royal visitors compared with trips by his sons Will and Harry, who brought wife Meghan, in the past 14 months.</p>
