      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a>'s side have amassed 34 points from the 36 on offer so far this term, with a <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-ruthless-liverpool-overcome-man-city-at-anfield_378576.html">3-1 triumph</a> over champions Manchester City earlier this month leaving them <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">eight points clear</a> of their closest challengers.</p>
      <p>Only one team in Premier League history has ever enjoyed a bigger lead at this stage of a season, and Liverpool will be favourites to continue their winning streak against a Palace side that has picked up only one point from their last four games.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how the Reds could line up for the trip to Selhurst Park.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Liverpool could be without two key players this weekend, with both Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson nursing ankle injuries which forced them out of international duty during the recent break.</p>
      <p>There was a positive update on their fitness on Thursday as both players took part in training, but they are still considered major doubts and Klopp is unlikely to take any risks with an important Champions League tie against Napoli to come on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Should they miss out then <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/james-milner/"><b>James Milner</b></a> could fill in at left-back and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/divock-origi/"><b>Divock Origi</b></a> could come into the front three, forcing a slight reshuffle which may result in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sadio-mane/"><b>Sadio Mane</b></a> switching to the right.</p>
      <p>The likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/"><b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/naby-keita/"><b>Naby Keita</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/adam-lallana/"><b>Adam Lallana</b></a> are also options for the attacking trident, although they may be forced to settle for places on the bench again this weekend.</p>
      <p>Joel Matip is another major doubt who is expected to miss the game due to his ongoing knee troubles, but there is better news with captain Jordan Henderson, Joe Gomez and Xherdan Shaqiri, all of whom are on course to be available.</p>
      <p>Henderson could start again in an unchanged midfield trio which also includes <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fabinho/"><b>Fabinho</b></a>, fresh from his goal against Man City before the international break, and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/georginio-wijnaldum/"><b>Georginio Wijnaldum</b></a>, who scored a hat-trick for Netherlands on Tuesday.</p>
