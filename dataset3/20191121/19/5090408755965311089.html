      <p>Investors should buy newly public <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/spce-stock">Virgin Galactic</a> because of its “near-term monopoly” in the budding space tourism industry, Credit Suisse analyst wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Our bullish view reflects the near-term monopoly SPCE offers in an industry (commercial space tourism) where public investment opportunities are scarce,” the firm wrote. “We view this as a classic tech-driven high demand, low supply story with high barriers to entry.”</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse initiated coverage of Virgin Galactic with an “outperform rating and $12.43 price target. That figure represents around a 39% premium from where shares traded on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The lack of current offerings for space tourism enables “sticky pricing,” as well as the potential for price discrimination, the analysts found. That dynamic – in combination with low-operating costs thanks to the firm already having invested in the required infrastructure – creates strong economics for its business model.</p>
      <p>“With no near-term competition, growth should be fueled by expanding supply,” the analysts wrote.</p>
      <p>The firm determined its price target for Virgin Galactic through a blended valuation including an equally-weighted enterprise multiple and discounted cash flow.</p>
      <p>The valuation also includes a 5% weighting for a potential catastrophic event such as a fatal crash, which was assigned a dollar-value of zero.</p>
      <p>According to the bank’s forecast, Virgin Galactic could generate $278 million in EBITDA in 2024 on revenue of $576 million.</p>
      <p>“Losses should dissipate rapidly as flight activity rises. Per flight ticket revenue is around 3x variable mission cost, which would drive very attractive incremental margins,” the analyst added.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse is the second firm behind Vertical Research Partners to initiate coverage on Virgin Galactic. Vertical Research has a $20 price target and “buy” rating on the stock, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
      <p>Virgin Galactic became the first publicly-traded <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/space-tourism-company-virgin-galactic-will-go-public-on-monday-2019-10-1028628607">space tourism</a> company in late October by merging with Social Capital Hedosophia, a venture capital firm run by Chamath Palihapitiya.</p>
