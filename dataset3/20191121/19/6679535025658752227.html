      <p>Mumbaikars can now see a massive replica of a part of the moon at Nehru Planetarium in Worli. The installation, Lunar Dome, which was unveiled on Thursday, is the Nehru Science Centre’s tribute to the Indian Space Research Organisation’s (ISRO) Chandrayaan missions.</p>
      <p>The dome, created using 2,500 bamboo shoots and 200 litres of paint, is an artistic rendition of the southern hemisphere of the moon and one of the biggest lunar domes in the country.</p>
      <p>The project was conceptualised by Sideways, a creative consulting outfit, and was executed in collaboration with Asian Paints and St+art India Foundation.</p>
      <p>“We chose to represent the southern hemisphere because that was where Chandrayaan 2 was supposed to land. Though the attempt was unsuccessful, we are proud of our scientists at ISRO and we wish them luck for the next Chandrayaan mission in November 2020,” Rahul Jain, an associate with Sideways, said.</p>
      <p>The project was completed within two-and-a-half months, Mr. Jain said. “The artist behind this, Ghulammahmad Bukhari a.k.a. Sharad, had only two weeks to complete the dome because of the untimely rain. So, although the idea was given around two months ago, he and his team completed 80% of the work in two weeks.”</p>
      <p>Chandrayaan 2 was the second lunar exploration mission developed by ISRO after Chandrayaan 1. It comprised an orbiter, lander and rover to explore the unexplored South Pole of the moon. It was inserted into the lunar orbit on August 20, but ISRO lost communication with it. The space research organisation recently announced the deadline for Chandrayaan 3 as November 2020.</p>
      <p>Arvind Paranjpay, director of Nehru Planetarium, said, “Nehru Planetarium has been hosting astronomical events to spark people’s interest in science and space for decades, making it the perfect site for moon landing. I am amazed to see such a magnificent artwork come up in such a short time. It is a unique tribute to ISRO.”</p>
      <p>A viewing gallery has been set up for visitors and will be open from 11 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. Entry is free.</p>
