      <p>Stephen A. Smith has caught more than his normal flack after his most recent take on the Colin Kaepernick situation. Pro athletes from across the sports spectrum privately reached out to Stephen A. condemning him for taking the side of the NFL, according to Smith. One such person was Pro Football Hall of Famer Terrell Owens who appeared on Smith's <i>First Take</i> show on Thursday. </p>
      <p>During their exchange on Kaepernick, T.O. riled up Stephen A. after he playfully quipped that Smith's stance on this matter makes his co-host Max Kellerman seem "blacker" than him. </p>
