      <p>A great-great grandmother from Derby celebrated her 106th lap around the sun today with a glass of whiskey in her hand.</p>
      <p>Gladys Gunn is thought to be the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/people">city's oldest resident</a>.</p>
      <p>She said the key to longevity is "to take each day at a time and to have a drop of whiskey each day in your coffee."</p>
      <p>During her birthday celebrations at her sheltered housing <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/alvaston">accommodation in Alvaston</a> she needed help blowing out her birthday candles but saw the funny side.</p>
      <p>Gladys has two children, six grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandson.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two has lived through both World Wars and reminisced about the time she arrived home from work to her address in Findern Street, to find two soldiers in her porch.</p>
      <p>She then took them in and looked after them for a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>For all of her life she has loved dancing, both old time and modern dance, saying that it used to be "her life".</p>

      <p>She used to dance with her husband Bill who passed away in 1967.</p>
      <p>She chuckled: "His (Bill's) mother was a teacher in old time dancing. I tried to teach him modern but he wouldn't do it!"</p>
      <p>She was born in 1913 in Northampton and met Bill while on holiday in Derby - which she said looks exactly the same as it did when she first visited.</p>
      <p>The lovebirds worked together at an off-licence in Bainbridge Street, Normanton.</p>
      <p>Gladys' eldest daughter, Glenyce Corns, 74, said her mum had various jobs but stopped working when she had her two daughters.</p>

      <p>She worked in Derby's knitting mills, as a home help and as a cook at St Christopher's Orphanage, to name a few.</p>
      <p>When working at the orphanage she would regularly invite one of the children back to her home, a girl called Valerie Hills, whom still visits her now.</p>
      <p>In her 60s Gladys did college courses in pottery and flower arranging.</p>
      <p>Her youngest daughter, Celia Houghton, 71, said they often went on railway trips as a family to the seaside.</p>
      <p>The gene for long life runs in the family as Gladys' great-grandmother reached the ripe old age of 104.</p>
