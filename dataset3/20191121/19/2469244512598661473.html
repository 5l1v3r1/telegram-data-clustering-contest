      <p>Charities across Devon are being invited to apply for a share of £2,000 to help the homeless this winter.</p>
      <p>Baker Estates is asking homeless charities to come forward across Devon, Cornwall and Dorset so that the money can be allocated to help the most in need in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Collection points have been organised at all its sites for local people to donate items that homeless people desperately need at this time of year.</p>
      <p>Ian Baker, managing director of Baker Estates, said: “We are appealing for charities to come forward so that we can put this money to good use. We also hope that people living near to our sites will donate unwanted clothing and essential items to make homeless people more comfortable this winter.”</p>
      <p>Annie Williams, head of sales at Baker Estates, added: “If members of the public have spare clean towels, underwear, coats, hats, gloves, torches, toiletries, blankets, waterproofs, please drop them into one of our sales and marketing suites. We will then arrange delivery to charities who can distribute these items to those who will need them most as the weather gets colder.”</p>
      <p>Anyone wishing to help can contact 080 81699116 or visit <a href="http://www.bakerestatesltd.co.uk/">bakerestatesltd.co.uk</a> for a full list of development locations and contact details.</p>
