      <p><b>Ben Mitchell (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) faced quite the dilemma in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tv-soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a>, as boyfriend Callum ‘Halfway’ Highway (Tony Clay) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/eastenders-spoilers-callum-highway-has-a-huge-proposition-for-ben-mitchell-10961927/">asked him to give up his life of crime</a>. Given that Ben has built quite the reputation being an orchestrator of dodgy deals, he wasn’t so keen, but with the prospect of losing Callum becoming more likely, he was left uncertain of what to do for the best</b>.</p>
      <p>Tonight, he attempted to make amends with Callum — who was in the middle of a meeting with Jack (Scott Maslen) about getting the ball rolling in regards to his police career. After putting his foot down in previous episodes, Callum remained steadfast in his position, and refused to let Ben talk him out of his dream.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t just Callum’s anger that Ben was on the receiving end of either, as Martin (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) and Kathy (Gillian Talyforth) reminded him of how unlikeable a human being he was becoming — and Ben finally started to see it for himself when he realised just how much Martin detested working for him.</p>

      <p>After making a successful sale at the car lot, Ben realised that he actually does have what it takes to go legit — but the question remained whether he wanted to or not. Mind you, with Callum on the line, he soon realised what he needed to do.</p>

      <p>Yes, Ben finally did the right thing and agreed to put an end to the arrangement he had with Martin. Additionally, he let Karen (Lorraine Stanley) off with her repayments, before handing the money-lending operation over to Tubbs full-time.</p>

      <p>An overjoyed Callum heard what Ben had done, and rushed to ask him whether or not he was doing this for him. In typical Ben fashion, he denied such a thing, but his reasons for going legit were incredibly apparent as he took hold of his man and gave him a passionate kiss.</p>
      <p>It appears as if love really can conquer all, eh?</p>
      <p>No, you’re crying.</p>
