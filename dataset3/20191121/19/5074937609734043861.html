      <h1>Four districts in WR benefit from UNFPA sponsored education on cancers for boys/men</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:25:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author">Mildred Siabi-Mensah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Agona-Nkwanta (WR), Nov. 21, GNA - About 200 boys and men were on Tuesday tutored on male related cancers and early warning signs to mark International Men's Day.</p>
      <p>The UNFPA-UNICEF joint programme on "empowering adolescent girls through access to comprehensive sexuality education and rights based quality sexual Reproductive Health Services in Ghana", funded the education organised by the Regional Department of Gender.</p>
      <p>Ms. Maribel Akuokor Okine, Acting Regional Director of the Department of Gender, said adolescent boys and young men often faced a number of reproductive health needs that needed to be addressed.</p>
      <p>She said currently, the Department with the support of the UNFPA was implementing a comprehensive sexuality education in four districts namely; Ahanta West, Wassa Amenfi East, Wassa East and Nzema East.</p>
      <p>She said the reproductive age of boys and young men though associated with sexual activeness, lacked knowledge about their new development, hence the education.</p>
      <p>"Adequate integration of their care is often lacking," she added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Muntari Goro Iddrisu, of the UNFPA said the growth of cancers among male population especially prostate cancer called for massive teachings on the disease condition for the necessary action to be taken.</p>
      <p>Male reproductive disorders may develop during various life phases and therefore the need to create the needed awareness.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Henrietta Eyison, the Ahanta West Municipal Chief Executive described the occasion as a laudable one to shed lights on male conditions that were often not talked about.</p>
      <p>She urged the young men not to indulge in promiscuous acts that could affect their development and a brighter future.</p>
