      <h1>Baker Mayfield Reacts To Myles Garrett’s ‘Racial Slur’ Allegation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:33:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>We have our first report of what took place during Myles Garrett’s appeal process. According to ESPN insider Adam Schefter, the Browns defensive end accused Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/myles-garrett-accuses-mason-rudolph-of-using-racial-slur-before-fight">of using a racial slur prior to their brawl</a>.</p>
      <p>Garrett received an indefinite suspension from the NFL for his role in Thursday night’s melee.</p>
      <p>In an effort to have his punishment reduced, Garrett met with league executives in New York on Wednesday. He’ll know his fate at some point this week.</p>
      <p>As of right now, the latest racial slur allegations from Garrett are taking the league by storm.</p>
      <p>It’s not too surprising that players on the Steelers are denying these claims. On the flip side, players on the Browns are also shocked by this development.</p>
      <p>Baker Mayfield revealed that he never heard of any racial slur remarks prior to today.</p>

      <p>Sheldon Richardson also admit that he didn’t hear about this until this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Once the news broke about a potential racial slur being used on the field, <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/mason-rudolphs-agent-has-fired-back-at-myles-garrett">Rudolph’s agent quickly denied the allegation</a>.</p>
      <p>In an official statement, Timothy M. Younger of Younger &amp; Associates/QB Limited said Garrett lied about Rudolph using a racial slur.</p>
      <p>We’ll find out soon enough how the NFL will handle all of this.</p>
