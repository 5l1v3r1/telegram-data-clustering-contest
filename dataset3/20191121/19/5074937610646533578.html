      <h1>NADMO inaugurates District Disaster Management Committee</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:05:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:05</time> by <a rel="author">Opesika Tetteh Puplampu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sege, (GAR) Nov. 21, GNA - The National Disaster Management Organisation (NADMO) has inaugurated the District Disaster Management Committee for Ada West, Ada East and Ningo Prampram Districts.</p>
      <p>The Committee is chaired by the District Chief Executives and includes heads of agencies at the district level.</p>
      <p>Mr. Seji Saji, the Greater Accra Regional Deputy Director General, Technical and Reforms charged the Committee Members to look at disaster risk reduction to help society fight the problem.</p>
      <p>He said the formation of the Committee was to put the new law of NADMO which is Act 927that mandated that every district should have a disaster management Committee.</p>
      <p>The Committee’s mandate is to draw out disaster management plans for the year and roll out an action plan.</p>
      <p>Mr Seji Saji said it is the responsibility of the Committee to draw a plan and come out with the measures to minimise the risks that disasters bring.</p>
      <p>"We can't prevent disasters, but can minimise its risk through our human activities. This Committee largely will look at disaster risk reduction rather than even responding to disasters as organization.</p>
      <p>“We are focusing more on disaster risk reduction, identifying the risk, coming out with measures to reduce the risk and at the end of the day. If disaster occurs, the whole district, respond together,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr A. L. Akrofi, DCE for the Ada West District who chaired the inauguration said that, it was necessary for the district to manage or control the disasters as they have been reoccurring.</p>
      <p>Most of these disasters are caused by the human factors.</p>
      <p>“We choke the gutters through the throwing of refuses indiscriminately, water has to find a different way if you block its way this accounted for the flooding in our homes,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said,“people really know the water ways, yet they build their homes on it and I want to state that it is about time that we enforced every by–law of the district assembly without fear or favour and also sensitise the public well on these issues.</p>
      <p>“I want to encourage all citizens to embrace and work with this committee so that we can together minimise the risks that come out of thes disasters”.</p>
      <p>Major I. K. E. Amoah, Second In Command (2IC) to the First Infantry Battalion of the Ghana Army told journalists that the Army were ever ready to partner in any National Development.</p>
      <p>"This Committee has become necessary due to the recent disasters we had especially flood. We all know that most of the problems we all have these days are people building in water ways, blocking streams, and other river bodies from using their normal ways.</p>
      <p>“This must also be tackled because aside the throwing away of garbage and refuse into gutters, the major issue that had to be dealt with is people building in water ways.</p>
      <p>“I hope that the committee will come out with a plan to channel this water ways to the appropriate gutters or get buildings that are not situated at the right places out if not, we will continue forming Committees, talking and nothing will be done at the end so we hope that something good will come out of this committee,” he said.</p>
      <p>Major Amoah said the military will support the police and the civil authorities to deliver anytime.</p>
      <p>Also present at the inauguration were: Ms Serah Dugbakie Pobee DCE for Ada East; Mr Jonathan Teye Paa Nii Doku, DCE for Ningo Prampram District; DSP George Aboagye, Sege Police Commander; Chief Superintendent George Andrew Kumah, Ada Divisional Police Commander, Madam Cynthia W. Aku Gbadago, the Ada West Educational Director and other heads of Departments.</p>
