      <p>A new Sainsbury's Local opening in Lyde Green will create 24 jobs for the area.</p>
      <p>The supermarket giant is throwing open the doors of its new store just in time for Christmas shoppers.</p>
      <p>Opening at 7am tomorrow (Friday), the shop will offer customers fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products, an in-store bakery and other convenience products.</p>
      <p>Residents in the small <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire </a>village currently only have a small bakery to buy their food items. However, nearby Emerson's Green already homes a huge Sainsbury's superstore.</p>
      <p>Jamie Ahearne, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury’s</a> Lyde Green Local store manager said: “We are delighted to be opening a brand new Local store in Bristol, providing residents and shoppers with a convenient place to pick up their favourite grocery products at great value.</p>
      <p>“The new store looks fantastic and we have a great team of colleagues who are really excited to welcome and serve customers.”</p>
      <p>Opening between 7am to 11pm,  the shop also has its own car park.</p>
