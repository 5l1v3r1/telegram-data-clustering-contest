      <p>WINNIPEG/MONTREAL, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Shippers scrambled to shift freight onto trucks on Thursday as a strike at Canada's biggest railroad, Canadian National Railway Co, entered its third day and left the critical fuel propane and other goods stranded.</p>
      <p>Some 3,200 unionized employees, including conductors and yard workers, hit picket lines on Tuesday in the biggest such action in a decade. The strike over working conditions has slowed output at industrial plants making chemicals, canola oil and other products.</p>
      <p>It has also held up deliveries of propane, used to heat homes in some provinces and to fuel crop dryers for farmers.</p>
      <p>Quebec Premier Francois Legault told reporters that the province only had a 4-and-a-half day propane supply. He urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government to impose back-to-work-legislation if the two sides failed to agree.</p>
      <p>Trucks waited more than six hours in Sarnia, Ontario, the closest propane pickup location to Quebec, said Canadian Propane Association Chief Executive Nathalie St-Pierre.</p>
      <p>"It's something that's never been experienced," she said, adding that the government should deem propane as an essential product for railways to move without interruption.</p>
      <p>Farmers cannot wait any longer for propane, with crops harvested wet from the field and needing to be dried, said Markus Haerle, chairman of Grain Farmers of Ontario.</p>
      <p>Shippers eager to reach customers are tapping other options.</p>
      <p>Major retailers and pulp and paper companies have started hiring trucks from Montreal-based Fuel Transport, even though they cost more than rail, said President Robert Piccioni. Others are just waiting for the strike to end.</p>
      <p>"When things like this go off the rails, we can ramp up and give (customers) the extra capacity. But as soon as rail comes back, it’s gone."</p>
      <p>While Piccioni was speaking to Reuters, he was notified of a customer ordering 50 trucks to haul food-grade liquids.</p>
      <p>That will require more tanks than Fuel Transport owns, but Piccioni said he would buy or rent the additional equipment.</p>
      <p>"There’s immense pressure on my team to get this done," he said.</p>
      <p>Alberta trucking firms have seen a modest pickup in work, as short-haul jobs they would normally handle turned into longer trips, said Jude Groves, chairman of the Alberta Motor Transport Association.</p>
      <p>"Everyone’s hedging their bets a bit. Generally, the impact of rail strikes is widespread and short-lived."</p>
      <p>CN Rail Chief Executive JJ Ruest said in a statement on Thursday he regretted that customers were inconvenienced and was committed to finding a solution.</p>
      <p>The railway has proposed binding arbitration, an option that the Teamsters Canadian Rail Conference union has rejected.</p>
      <p>The union's concerns center on fatigue, safety and ensuring that workers' breaks are not reduced.</p>
      <p>Lyndon Isaak, president of the union, told Reuters that workers were "extremely happy" with Trudeau's government for allowing the sides to continue negotiations.</p>
      <p>Isaak said the contract dispute was over working hours, not money.</p>
      <p>"They want to work our conductors longer and make them perform more duties over that period."</p>
      <p>Canada relies on CN and Canadian Pacific Railway to move crops, potash, coal and manufactured goods to ports and the United States.</p>
      <p>The strike has curbed oil shipments by rail during a period where full pipelines have already forced Alberta to curb production. Provincial inventories have surged and are approaching last year's peak, Eight Capital analyst Phil Skolnick said.</p>
      <p>Credit Suisse highlighted the impact on Hudbay Minerals Inc from the strike in a note, saying its sales would lag and inventory would pile up if the strike continued.</p>
      <p>The company's stock fell 2.9%.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Canada's transport minister said the talks were making progress. A spokesman said on Thursday there was no further update.</p>
      <p>CN shares dropped 0.6% in Toronto, continuing a four-day slide of 3.4%. (Reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal and Rod Nickel in Winnipeg; additional reporting by Kelsey Johnson in Ottawa and Denny Thomas in Toronto; Editing by David Gregorio and Lisa Shumaker)</p>
