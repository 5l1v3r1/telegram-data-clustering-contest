      <p>Tamale (N/R), Nov. 21, GNA - The Ghana Integrity Initiative (GII) has organised a two-day anti-corruption workshop in Tamale, to elicit the support of Religious and Faith Based Organisations (FBO) to respond to corruption.</p>
      <p>The workshop was informed by the vision of Ghana's National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP) to create a sustainable democratic society, found on good governance with high ethics and integrity.</p>
      <p>It constituted activities of a DANIDA supported project titled "Speak Up, Resist and Report Corruption" with the objective of seeking the support of religious leaders and the media in creating awareness, reporting and addressing corruption and it related issues in the country.</p>
      <p>The training, which was dubbed, "Enhancing the role of faith based and civil society organisations in the fight against corruption", had 50 participants from 10 districts within the Northern region, to be sensitised on their roles in making corruption a high risk, low gain activity.</p>
      <p>Mr Charles Ayamdoo, the Director of Anti-Corruption at the Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) said the government, private sector and civil society should collaborate to fight corruption and bring credibility, effectiveness and sustainability in administering state and non-state institutions in the country.</p>
      <p>He admonished FBOs to lead the response against corruption and related elements and said the power of religion placed them in a better position to help curb the phenomenon, because they exerted influence in society.</p>
      <p>Mr Ayamdoo said there was the need for Civil Society Organisations to adhere to strict principles of transparency and accountability in their daily operations.</p>
