      <p><b>SAINT-ÉTIENNE, FRANCE: </b>A zoo in central France is searching for a runaway red panda which took advantage of heavy snowfall that brought down trees to climb from branch-to-branch out of its enclosure.</p>
      <p>The hopes of the zoological park in Saint-Martin-la-Plaine in central France of recovering the furry mammal, which resembles a raccoon, were boosted after a motorist on Wednesday spotted the animal and alerted the police.</p>

      <p>The three-year-old male escaped a week ago, “taking advantage of the damage caused by snowfall,” the zoo’s director Pierre Thivillon said.</p>
      <p>Its female partner did not follow it out of the enclosure.</p>
      <p>“People who see it must warn us and try not to let it out of sight so that we can capture it,” said Thivillon.</p>

      <p>The driver spotted the animal some 10 kilometres (six miles) from the zoo but the police and zoo staff have been unable to locate it.<br/>Red pandas are unrelated to the more famous giant pandas. They are not bears and have their own taxonomically unique family called Ailuridae.</p>
      <p>The shy creatures spend most of their time in trees and are not considered dangerous.</p>
