      <h1>Steelers Players React To Myles Garrett’s “Racial Slur” Allegation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:17:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier Thursday afternoon, Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett alleged Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/myles-garrett-accuses-mason-rudolph-of-using-racial-slur-before-fight">Mason Rudolph called him a racial slur</a> before last Thursday night’s brawl.</p>
      <p>According to a report from ESPN, Garrett brought up the alleged slur in his meeting with the NFL regarding a potential appeal to his suspension.</p>
      <p>Rudolph’s agent released a statement denying the allegation.</p>
      <p>Now, his teammates have weighed in. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkKaboly/status/1197589981616918530">Pittsburgh insider Mark Kaboly</a>, several Steelers players “aren’t happy with the news,” and called the allegations “bogus.”</p>
      <p>Steelers star defensive lineman Cam Heyward also came out in support of his quarterback.</p>
      <p>“I know Mason didn’t say that,” Heyward said.</p>

      <p>Even some of Garrett’s teammates said they were surprised to hear of the allegations. Browns reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/Jake_Trotter/status/1197587995001528320">Jake Trotter</a> spoke to Baker Mayfield and Sheldon Richardson, who both denied hearing anything about a slur until today.</p>
      <p>Garrett failed to mention a racial slur in his post-game press conference. It’s possible he decided to wait until his meeting with the NFL before revealing what Rudolph said to him.</p>
      <p>The star defensive end received an indefinite suspension after he hit Rudolph with his own helmet. He appealed the suspension and is awaiting the NFL’s decision.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
