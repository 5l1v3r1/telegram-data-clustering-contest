      <p>The filing with the Federal Election Committee means the media mogul is able to raise funds for a White House campaign, but an aide said no final decision has been made on whether he will run.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg has made a series of moves towards a potential bid for the presidency, and has already registered to appear on the ballot in Alabama, Arkansas and Texas.</p>
      <p>A separate advisor told Reuters that Bloomberg has also filed to be on the ballot in Georgia and Michigan.</p>
      <p>The 77-year-old has indicated that he plans a late entry in the Democratic primary, where there is already a field of nearly 20 candidates.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg would likely bypass some of the earlier voting states, where other candidates have been campaigning for months, and instead focus on the so-called Super Tuesday primaries held in Alabama, Arkansas and Texas.</p>
      <p>The tycoon, whose final term as New York mayor ended in 2013, has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump and has lobbied for an end to his trade war with China, saying it cost jobs and slows innovation.</p>
