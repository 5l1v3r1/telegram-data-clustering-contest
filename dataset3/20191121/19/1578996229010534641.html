      <h1>Pete Davidson Has One Final Thing to Say About Ariana Grande One Year After Their Split</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:37:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:37</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Pete Davidson is <i>Paper</i> magazine's <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-pete-davidson-2641400317.html?rebelltitem=32#rebelltitem32">second Break the Internet cover star</a> (BTS was <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-bts-2641354203.html">their first</a>), and the <i>SNL </i>star shared a lot about what he's learned from his relationships with Tommy Dorfman, the friend tapped by <i>Paper</i> to interview him. Dorfman asked Davidson at the end of the interview whether he wanted to talk about Ariana Grande. The two had a <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g21273661/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-relationship-timeline/">whirlwind romance</a> last spring, got engaged in May 2018 and broke up in October 2018. It's been a year since, and Davidson has since dated Kate Beckinsale, Margaret Qualley, and now allegedly Kaia Gerber.</p>
      <p>Davidson did have a diplomatic last word. He said, "I don't ever make public statements about relationships 'cause I just don't think it's right, you know? I usually express how I feel about anything through work. So, I hope she's well. I hope she's very happy. And that's pretty much it. And print doesn't usually age well."</p>
      <p>Generally, Davidson spoke about love language and the past issues he's dealt with when people he has dated haven't been able to cope well with his intensity.</p>
      <p>"I do all that shit!" Davidson said when asked what his love language is. "My love language, when I'm in a relationship, is I treat the person I'm with like a princess. I try and go as above and beyond as possible, because that's what you're supposed to do? If you're in a relationship with someone, you're just supposed to make that person feel as special as possible. But sometimes when you put so much on someone, it overwhelms them, and then they don't know if they could come close to that."</p>
      <p>He added that his pampering, "it's very off-putting to some. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't, and then it sometimes makes me feel bad about myself because I'm like, 'I did all this stuff and...'"</p>
      <p>But one of his biggest lessons from his past relationships is that they're his, not the public's. "It's nobody's business," he said. "I think when you first get in a relationship and you're on television, you don't realize that when you post a photo of you and your girlfriend, you're pretty much announcing to the world your relationship. I didn't know that because I know couples that are together that I followed that, you know, are my homies that work at Best Buy, and when they post each other's picture all the time and there are no articles written about it or they're not followed around, you forget that you have to approach it differently, which is really difficult for both [people in the relationship], because the second [the public] knows you're together, it's already against you. You're losing. Because now they know you're together, if you're not [seen together], they know something went wrong. As opposed to like... people date. People date and are friends."</p>
