      <p>The Halcyon Quartet are heading back to Devon by popular demand.</p>
      <p>The string quartet bowled over residents in Morebath in the summer and will be returning to the church on Sunday, December 1 at 2:30 pm.</p>
      <p>Among their snippets of Haydn and Mendelssohn, there will be the chance to sing carols, led by the players.</p>
      <p>Penny Adie, who is organising the event said: How often does one get the chance to air the seasonal vocal cords in such a classy manner?</p>
      <p>“Not any old - or young - foursome string players, these girls are highly polished and are rapidly climbing the ladder to become a force to be reckoned with in the world of high-class classical music.</p>
      <p>“For those who will feel deprived of listening to serious string quartets, they will be performing Beethoven’s famous Op 18 No 1 later in the afternoon.</p>
      <p>“Their programmes are not stiff. Their music is full of life and exuberance. They appeal to all ages. They talk about the music. They have the ability to put across the message that music is fun and to be enjoyed.</p>
      <p>“All in all, their appeal is across the board.</p>
      <p>“To make this event even jollier, there will be a scrumptious cream tea. So do come along.</p>
      <p>“The concert is remarkably good value at £10 ticket. So do come; and not just for the cream tea.”</p>
      <p>Tickets are £10, and cream teas are £4.50. Contact Penny Adie on 01398 331492 or email  <a href="mailto:adie.exmoor@btinternet.com">adie.exmoor@btinternet.com</a> .</p>
