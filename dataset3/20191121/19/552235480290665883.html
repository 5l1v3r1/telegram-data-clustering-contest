      <p>The cost of fixing Scotland’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/more-1000-additional-potholes-stirlings-20552738">pothole-blighted roads</a> has reached £3billion, according to a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/holyrood-urged-get-grip-young-20328907">Holyrood</a> committee.</p>
      <p>More than a third of local streets and 13 per cent of major <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/major-roadworks-begin-busy-horsely-20665421">roads</a> need work done, the rural economy and connectivity committee found.</p>

      <p>In a letter to Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, convener Edward Mountain wrote: “The committee is concerned that there is an estimated £1.2billion backlog for maintenance of trunk roads and around £1.8billion needs to be spent to bring the local roads network up to a satisfactory standard.”</p>
      <p>Mountain cited Audit Scotland reports that show there has been a 26 per cent decline in spending on local roads over five years.</p>
      <p>He said the committee “is agreed that a new approach is needed to make significant inroads into addressing the accepted maintenance backlogs”.</p>

      <p>Tory MSP Jamie Greene said: “After 12 years of Nationalist neglect, Scotland has £3billion of repair backlogs and 150,000 potholes.</p>
      <p>A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We are making significant efforts to maximise every penny that is spent on maintenance. The budget for maintaining roads Transport Scotland looks after has increased by £33million in 2019-20.”</p>
