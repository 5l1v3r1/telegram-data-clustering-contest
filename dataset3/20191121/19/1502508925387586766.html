      <p>Blaming <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation">demonetisation </a>and the “ill-implemented” goods and services tax regime for the current economic slowdown, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/west-bengal">West Bengal </a>Finance Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/amit-mitra">Amit Mitra </a>(pictured) on Thursday hit out at the central government for delaying GST compensation to states, claiming it has hurt their finances.</p>
      <p>“It is not a cyclical correction but a structural slowdown. The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/demonetisation">demonetisation </a>decision hit businesses across the country. A few months later, another blow came in the form of the ill-conceived GST rollout,” Mitra said in a press conference.</p>
      <p>India’s GDP growth fell to 5 per cent in the first quarter of the current financial year and is estimated to have dipped further in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Mitra highlighted an increase in the cash in the economy and suspicious transactions after demonetisation, and how the badly implemented GST led to a rise in incidents of frauds, causing leakages.</p>
      <p>Suspicious transactions reports (STR) increased 14 times in 2017-18, as compared to the year prior to demonetisation, he said citing government data. He said of over 1.4 million STRs received, only 82,595 were processed.</p>
      <p>“GST frauds at least to the tune of Rs 1 trillion have taken place so far, if we include states’ data,” said Mitra. He said discontinuation of invoice matching through GSTR 2 had given rise to incidents of fraud.</p>
