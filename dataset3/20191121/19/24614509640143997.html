      <p>U.S. equities are under pressure on Thursday as Washington criticizes China for its protest crackdown in Hong Kong. This, in turn, is threatening to undermine chances of a U.S.-China trade agreement after months of near-constant hints and teases that a deal was coming. As a reminder, the United States is set to impose another tariff hike on imports from China in December without a deal.</p>
      <p>And while President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to salvage optimism — with reports this morning that tariffs could be held back even without a trade deal — the nagging concern is that a deal just doesn’t happen before the 2020 presidential election. Beijing is likely betting that Trump is going to be replaced by a democrat more willing to pen a deal favorable to them.</p>
      <p>But until then, stocks are feeling the heat with selling focused on areas like retailers heading into the critical holiday shopping season. Here are six popular retail stocks that are being sold hard:</p>
