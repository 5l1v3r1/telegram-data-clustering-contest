      <p>There’s a “little” competition happening between KyCine and SethDrea, the love team of Kyle Echarri and Francine Diaz and Seth Fedelin and Andrea Brillantes, respectively. The onscreen tandems are asking their fans to vote via a Facebook poll that runs until tomorrow.</p>
      <p>“It’s just a friendly competition. It’s up to the fans whether or not they want to see our movie first. But both movies are good. It’s just a matter of which movie will be seen by the audience depending on the result of the poll,” says Kyle who is starring opposite Francine in Silly Red Shoes.</p>

      <p>The digital movie revolves around sweet and shy Chuck (Kyle) and simple and good-hearted Ashley (Francine). Planning to revive his family’s worn-out shoe business, Chuck asks for the help of Ashley to model a new pair of shoes for a contest. Insecure of her “alien feet,” which change sizes every day, Ashley finds a reliable and determined shoemaker in Chuck.</p>
      <p>As the two grow closer, they discover a secret behind a mysterious pair of red shoes that seem to be too perfect for Ashley.</p>
      <p>Directed by James Mayo and co-produced by Dreamscape Entertainment and Spring Films, Silly Red Shoes also stars  Anna Luna, Karen Reyes,  and  Herbert Bautista.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in SethDrea’s  Wild Little Love, Sam (Andrea) is a spoiled, rich girl forced to attend a public high school as punishment for her wild, chaotic behavior. Having a hard time adjusting to her new environment, she gets help from hardworking chick magnet Jake (Seth), who teaches her the ways of the simple life.</p>
