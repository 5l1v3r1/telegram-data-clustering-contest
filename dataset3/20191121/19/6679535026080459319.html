      <h1>Rape cases against minors on the rise, most offenders known to them: report</h1>
      <h2>Of the total number of victims in 2018-19, 69 were below six years old</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T19:36:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 19:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Dhairya-Gajara-91151/" target="_blank">Dhairya Gajara</a></address>
      <p>Most victims of rape cases registered in the previous financial year were minors, with over 90% of the offenders being known to them, said a report released by Praja Foundation on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The annual report on the state of policing and law and order in Mumbai also highlights the shortage of police personnel in the city and the large number of cases pending for investigation and trials in 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the report, which compares the statistics of each financial year, 69% of rape cases registered between April 2018 and March 2019 were against children. Further, it states that 2,358 cases of molestation were recorded in 2017-18, which increased by 7% to 2,533 in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>However, there was a slight fall in rape cases, with 784 in 2018-19 as compared to 792 in 2017-18.</p>
      <p>Nitai Mehta, president, Praja, said out of all the sexual offences against children, 69 victims were under the age of six. “As in 90% of these cases, the offender is known to the victim, it is not a law-and-order problem but a matter of introspection for us as a society.”</p>
      <h3>Increase in murders</h3>
      <p>In other crimes, murder cases increased by 43% to 165 cases in 2018-19 from 115 cases in 2017-18.</p>
      <p>The report states that in 2018-19, the highest number of cases have been reported in north central Mumbai, which includes Vile Parle, Kurla, Bandra and Chembur with 739 cases of molestation, 211 cases of rape and 46 cases of murder, whereas 244 rape cases, the highest number, were registered in northwest Mumbai.</p>
      <p>According to the report, there is a deficiency of 41% for the post of assistant police inspector in the Mumbai Police, and 28% for police sub-inspector posts.</p>
      <p>The highest shortage was recorded in the police control room at 51%, while the Crime Branch recorded a 41% deficiency.</p>
      <p>The report also has a survey of 22,845 households, commissioned to Hansa Research, which revealed that 59% respondents who witnessed crime and 43% who faced them, reported it to the police station.</p>
      <p>Milind Mhaske, director, Praja Foundation, said, “The most common reason the respondents gave for not registering cases are that they felt speaking to police officials is a painful task or that they were unwilling to get into trouble. Around 9% of people who witnessed crimes and 6% who faced crimes said they don’t have faith in the police or legal system.”</p>
