      <p>The prestigious TM Forum has cited Globe as one of the 13 top telcos and vendors which are supporting the new Open API and Open Digital Architecture Manifesto that is focused on enabling a plug-and-play information technology (IT) and business architecture.</p>
      <p>Globe along with Accenture, Axiata, China Mobile, China Unicom, CSG, Etiya, MyRepublic, Openet, Orange, Sigscale and Vodafone, have agreed to support and lead the industry towards a radical uplift in IT agility and software architecture. The 13 firms likewise are strongly promoting zero touch, interoperability and partnering.</p>
      <p>"We at Globe are committed to a future that is open, transparent across the digital ecosystem, which then allows us to meet the needs of our customers of the future -- all digital, easy, fast and suited to the modern lifestyle of the Filipino," Gil Genio, Globe Chief Technology and Information Officer and Chief Strategy Officer, said.</p>
      <p>By signing the TM Forum manifesto, Globe is committed to deliver a range of growth and efficiency opportunities including agility across its business and customers by providing a flexible, modular architecture enabled by the Open Digital Architecture; significantly reduce time-to-market; digital customer interactions; operate highly automated (zero-touch) operations and end-to-end management of complex services across digital ecosystems and deliver high quality services at lower costs among others.</p>
      <p>The TM Forum has been successful in designing, standardizing and promoting architectures and APIs for Communication Service Providers (CSPs), providers and integrators. It helps its members benefit from the latest evolutions being driven by the dynamic, software-based flow of new technologies, services and platforms.</p>
      <p>Since its launch three years ago, the TM Forum, 53 of the world’s leading CSPS and technology ecosystem participants have signed the Open API Manifesto and in the process have publicly known their support of the Forum’s suite of more than 50 Open APIs.</p>
