      <p>The newest and biggest FamilyMart in the country is truly one-of-a-kind in more ways than one. From the expansive food offerings to the cozy dining and working spaces, this one redefines the ‘konbini’.</p>

        <b>1. Co-working Space</b>
      </p>
      <p>Productivity and convenience go hand-in-hand as this FamilyMart offers a co-working space that’s conducive to studying, reading, and, basically, getting what needs to be accomplished on your computer done--all while enjoying any of the goodies in the store. For a minimum purchase of only P250, customers enjoy free Wi-Fi and a cozy corner in the exclusive co-working area, which looks out to the zen garden.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Zen Garden</b>
      </p>
      <p>That’s right, this FamilyMart has its very own zen garden! Thoughtfully located next to the co-working space, it provides busy bees a calming view for when taking a break from their screens. The landscape, reminiscent of scenes from a Japanese manga, is just what anyone needs for a breather.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Function Rooms</b>
      </p>
      <p>Further setting itself apart from other FamilyMart stores, this one has two function rooms called Osaka and Tokyo, accommodating 8 and 12 persons, respectively. Each is equipped with audio-video facilities, making such spaces ideal for meetings and brainstorming sessions--best done, of course, over some of the store’s delectable food items and some caffeine boost courtesy of FamilyMart Coffee Creations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Ramen</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is not a drill. The iconic noodle dish is now available in a FamilyMart in Manila. This one has a dedicated ramen station where Tonkotsu, Tantanmen, and Miso varieties are served hot. For only P165, any fan of the beloved Japanese delicacy can enjoy a bowl, which even comes with a complementing drink. The rich, flavorful broth alone is crave-worthy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Restrooms</b>
      </p>
      <p>There’s nothing like the convenience of having a clean restroom within your reach when the call of nature comes. Thankfully, this store has two for when bathroom breaks are in order between meetings with colleagues and catch-up sessions with friends. There’s even an Insta-worthy mirror above the communal sink!</p>
      <p>
        <b>6. Onigiri, Donburi, and other Japanese specialties</b>
      </p>
      <p>The beloved rice triangles are now here! Complete with the signature three-step unwrapping process, Salmon, Tuna Mayo, Tori Mix, Spam, or Tinapa is wrapped in a hefty layer of Japanese rice and blanketed with fresh nori for a delectable, filling snack or complete meal. Meanwhile, unlike other FamilyMart stores where donburi meals come in Filipino food-inspired variations, this one offers the Japanese rice bowl with more faithfulness to its origins. Pork Yakiniku, Gyudon, and Katsudon are laid on top of a hefty serving of Japanese rice, making each serving perfect for a satisfying lunch or dinner. Meanwhile, the chiller holds other Japanese favorites, including Maki, and an array of bento meals featuring Pork Tonkatsu, Yakiniku, and Tempura.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Beer Room</b>
      </p>
      <p>Liquor drinkers are in for a treat with this store’s walk-in chiller stocked with a variety of local and imported beers and other liquors. What’s even better is, these drinks can be enjoyed from 7pm onwards in the dining area or in one of the function rooms. A six-pack, consumed with some of the signature food items would be the perfect way to end any workday.</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Wider dining space and more variety of breakfast and healthy food items</b>
      </p>
      <p>With the capacity to accommodate up to 40 diners, FamilyMart UDENNA Tower is most certainly a dining destination. Whether it’s around one of the round tables or perched on one of the bar stools, the place has enough space for customers who wish to enjoy their treats inside the store. Some of such delicious items could be from the expanded menu of breakfast choices including tapsilog and yang chow meals, as well as healthy options, like a variety of fresh vegetable salads and wraps. For those looking to indulge, however, there’s the thin-crust pizza (supremo, hawaiian, four cheese, pepperoni), another item exclusive to this branch.</p>
      <p>Visit FamilyMart Udenna Tower when it opens today, November 20, at the Ground Floor of the Udenna Tower, Rizal Drive corner 4th Avenue, Fort Bonifacio Global City, Taguig City.</p>
