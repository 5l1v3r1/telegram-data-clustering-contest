      <p>Nadine Coyle has been getting to grips with life in the jungle in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> – kicking her time on the show off <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">with a terrifying skydive</a> as well as spilling gossip <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-reveals-why-shes-not-friends-with-girls-aloud-anymore-11183751/">on her fellow Girls Aloud stars while in camp.</a></p>

      <p>Just who is Jason and what happened between the pair of them?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Who is Nadine Coyle’s ex-partner Jason Bell?</h3>
      <p>Jason is an American football star who’s played for the Dallas Cowboys, Houston Texans and New York Giants.</p>

      <p>Nadine and Jason began dating in 2008 when they met in the US <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-nadine-coyle-accent-11177185/">after the singer moved there for work.</a></p>

      <p>They got engaged in 2010 but split up a year later – albeit briefly, before reconciling – with Nadine later revealing that she got cold feet after deciding she was too young to be married.</p>
      <p>I got with Jason when I was 23 and [got] engaged, and I suddenly thought: ‘Hang on. I can’t get married, I’m only 25,’ she told Fabulous magazine in 2018.</p>
      <h3>Do Nadine and Jason have children?</h3>
      <p>Nadine and Jason are parents to a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2014/02/10/its-official-theres-a-baby-aloud-cheryl-cole-leads-the-congratulations-as-nadine-coyle-gives-birth-to-baby-girl-4298976/">daughter, Anaiya, who was born in February 2014.</a></p>
      <p>At the time, Nadine announced: ‘I am overjoyed to let you know our little girl is here. She is amazing! I love being a mammy &amp; will fill you all in soon.’</p>
      <p>It’s been reported that she and Jason will co-parent their now five-year-old daughter following their split.</p>
      <h3>Why did Nadine and Jason split?</h3>

      <p>‘Although Nadine and Jason were never married, they lived as a close family unit and remain good friends as they co-parent their young daughter,’<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/9857028/girls-aloud-nadine-coyle-splits-american-football-jason-bell/"> an insider told The Sun at the time.</a></p>
