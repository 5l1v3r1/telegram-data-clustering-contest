      <h1>Mason Rudolph’s Agent Has Fired Back At Myles Garrett</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:48:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The brawl that broke out between Browns DE Myles Garrett and Steelers QB Mason Rudolph has forced Garrett to speak to the NFL and appeal an indefinite suspension. During that appeal, Garrett reportedly alleged that part of the confrontation stemmed from a racial slur Rudolph directed at him.</p>
      <p>In the wake of this allegation of racial language, Rudolph’s agent has responded.</p>
      <p>In an official statement, Timothy M. Younger of Younger &amp; Associates/QB Limited stated flat-out that the allegation that Rudolph used a racial slur is a lie.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full statement:</p>
      <blockquote>According to ESPN, in his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur towards him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason’s uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension. This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing, and conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett. The malicious use of this wild and unfounded allegation is an assault on Mason’s integrity which is far worse than the physical assault witnessed on Thursday. This is reckless and shameful. We will have no further comment.</blockquote>

      <h3>While one can accuse Younger of showing favoritism to his client, he does make a potentially interesting point.</h3>
      <p>If Garrett heard Rudolph use the slur at the time of the incident, it’s odd to only be hearing that part of the story from him now.</p>
      <p>But it’s also not the first time this has been suggested. Prior to deleting the tweet, ESPN’s <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/myles-garrett-mason-rudolph-helmet-josina-anderson-tweet">Josina Anderson suggested that Rudolph might have used a slur</a>.</p>
      <p>“I would bet Myles Garrett will say he heard Mason Rudolph call him something egregious. Never seen Garrett act like that, ever,” she wrote before deleting the tweet.</p>
      <p>This giant mess of a story just got another, possibly uglier layer to it.</p>
