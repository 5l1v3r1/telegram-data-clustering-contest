      <h1>Railways restores original track at Kulashekara</h1>
      <h2>It has also built temporary protection walls</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:04:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>With memory still fresh of the disruption of train services owing to landslips on a short stretch of the Mangaluru-Mumbai track near Kulashekara, Railways has begun permanent restoration works on the stretch.</p>
      <p>As a first step, the Palakkad Division of Southern Railway has restored the landslip-affected track a couple of days ago and began operating trains on the restored track of about 200m.</p>
      <p>The division had built a new line adjacent to the affected stretch of the track as a temporary measure since slurry was constantly getting deposited on the track following incessant torrential rain.</p>
      <p>Besides restoring the track to the original alignment, Railways has also built temporary protection walls abutting the affected hillock.</p>
      <p>Train services between the north and the south were affected between August 23 and 31 as earth from the adjacent hillock caved in on the track.</p>
      <p>Railwaysâ€™ estimate that it was a minor landslip that could be cleared within a day proved otherwise as loose soil continued to get deposited on the track in the form of slurry owing to heavy rains.</p>
      <p>While it was easy to clear soil, Railways found it very hard to clear the slurry getting deposited on the affected track. Consequently, it thought of laying a new track parallel to the existing one that was on a little higher elevation and free from slurry deposits. The work got completed on August 31 and train services resumed thereafter.</p>
      <h3>Permanent protection</h3>
      <p>Senior officials in the Palakkad Division told <i>The Hindu</i> that after restoration of the track and temporary protection works, permanent protection works are being taken up. Gabion walls would be constructed along the affected stretch to prevent further landslips in the coming days.</p>
      <p>Also, works on stabilisation of the slopes of the hillock are underway while hill cuttings are being regularised, the officials said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, work on track doubling at the stretch is also going on simultaneously, officials said. The stretch falls under the Mangaluru Junction-Panambur section of the SR where track doubling and electrification work is underway.</p>
