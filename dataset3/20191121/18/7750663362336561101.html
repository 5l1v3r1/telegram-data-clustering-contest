      <p>The Uruguay international has made 65 appearances for the Gunners since arriving from Sassuolo in the summer of 2018, contributing four goals and five assists in the process.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium during the summer, though, and there remains speculation surrounding his future.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, both Milan and Napoli want to sign the South American in the January transfer window on an 18-month loan with a view to future transfer.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Torreira remains 'unsettled in the Premier League' and will consider any offers that arrive for his services in the early stages of 2020.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has scored twice in 15 appearances for the Gunners during the 2019-20 campaign, including once in nine Premier League outings.</p>
