      <p>A security company has released a decryption tool for a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-an-executive-guide-to-one-of-the-biggest-menaces-on-the-web/">new ransomware variant</a> which places its ransom demand over the PC's desktop wallpaper.</p>
      <p>Emsisoft, which has <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/34716/emsisoft-releases-a-new-decryptor-for-hakbit-ransomware/">build the decryption tool</a>, said that the Hakbit ransomware has hit home users and businesses in the US and Europe, demanding $300 in bitcoin from victims, while warning them how many files they stand to lose. <br/><br/>It's a newly discovered strain of ransomware, but as well as changing the victim's desktop wallpaper into a ransom note (these are more usually posted as text files), this variant also includes a QR code pointing to the bitcoin address where it wants the victim to send money, a feature which has not been seen in ransomware for several years. <br/><br/><b>SEE: </b><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/topic/a-winning-strategy-for-cybersecurity/"><b>A winning strategy for cybersecurity</b></a><b> (ZDNet special report) | </b><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/whitepapers/a-winning-strategy-for-cybersecurity-free-pdf/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b"><b>Download the report as a PDF</b></a><b> (TechRepublic)</b><br/><br/>Hakbit encrypts its victims' files using AES-256 and appends with the extension ".crypted", Emsisoft said.</p>
      <p>On installation, Hakbit attempts to conceal its presence by randomly naming its executable to one of the following: lsass.exe, svchst.exe, crcss.exe, chrome32.exe, firefox.exe, calc.exe, mysqld.exe, dllhst.exe, opera32.exe, memop.exe, spoolcv.exe, ctfmom.exe, or SkypeApp.exe.<br/><br/>Ransomware has been a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-security-warning-ransomware-is-growing-fastest-and-just-got-harder-to-tackle/">growing menace in recent years</a>. In particular it has become more of a problem for business as ransomware crooks have decided that they can make more from targeting whole networks of computers rather than individual home PCs. </p>
      <p>Earlier this week Emsisoft published a <a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/34636/emsisoft-releases-new-decryptor-for-jigsaw-ransomware/">free decryption tool for Jigsaw</a> ransomware which can currently unlock 85 variants of the malware.</p>
