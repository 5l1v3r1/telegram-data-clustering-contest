      <h1>'Carnage' - What really happened in that footballers' VIP box at Cheltenham Festival</h1>
      <h2>Former Aston Villa pair Samir Carruthers and James Collins were involved as Bristol City players came under fire for their antics at the Cheltenham horse racing festival three years ago</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:30</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Former Bristol City striker Aaron Wilbraham has revealed what really went on at Cheltenham racecourse in that infamous episode.</p>
      <p>Wilbraham was attending the races along with Luke Ayling - now of Leeds United - and former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> pair Samir Carruthers and James Collins.</p>
      <p>The players had a private box at the 2016 <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/cheltenham-festival">Cheltenham Festival</a> and were joined there by reality TV stars from popular show Love Island and famous models.</p>
      <p>It got so out of hand that police stopped people from re-entering the box if they left to use the toilet, for example, leading to some players deciding to urinate into plastic cups.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And Wilbraham has revealed the inside story of the fateful day when <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> got onto the front pages as well as the back.</p>
      <p>"We went there and my agent had a box,” Wilbraham told the <a href="https://audioboom.com/channel/undr-the-cosh">Undr The Cosh</a> podcast as reported by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-cheltenham-festival-urinating-3560021">BristolLive</a> .</p>
      <p>“I remember all the Love Island girls were coming in and one of them had told the paparazzi what box we were all in and she flashed her t**s.</p>
      <p>“None of the lads knew she was going and a few of them got photographed as they were looking,” he added.</p>

      <p>“It was online straight away. It was carnage in this box, my agent had probably invited too many people.</p>
      <p>“It was a free bar and before you knew it, this box was rammed,” he added.</p>
      <p>Naturally, once the players had sunk a few pints of ale nature started to take its course.</p>
      <p>There was moral outrage at the time that players had been pouring their urine onto members of the public below, but that turned out not to be the case.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“They (the stewards) needed people to get out for health and safety but no one wanted to leave, so every time someone went to the toilet they weren't letting you back in," he continued.</p>
      <p>“The lads were dying for a p*** so they were pi****g in pint glasses on the balcony.</p>
      <p>"They weren't throwing them they were just laying them down.</p>
      <p>“They didn't want to go because they wouldn't get back in the box for the free bar.</p>
      <p>“The papers it was made out that they were p***ing and throwing it but that wasn't it,” he added.</p>
