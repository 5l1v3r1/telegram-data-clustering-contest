        <b>A high-level business delegation from MEDEF (the largest French business leader’s association) is set for Kampala to identify business opportunities and potential local partners.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The business delegation of more than 25 companies will be led by Momar Nguer, Chairman of the Africa Committee of MEDEF International and President Marketing &amp; Services and member of the Executive Committee of Total.</p>
      <p>President Yoweri Museveni is scheduled to meet the delegation after they hold business to business meetings and conclude site visits. The delegation will be in the country from 25th to 26th November 2019.</p>
      <p>According to a statement from the French embassy, the delegation will encompass the major opportunities and challenges at stake in Uganda. “The French companies are eager to develop their activities, partnerships, and investments in Uganda,” the embassy said.</p>
      <p>The delegation includes firms like Omexom Major Projects, Ponticelli Frères, Ragni SAS, Société Générale, Sogea Satom, Suez International, Thalès, Total marketing &amp; services, Vinci Concessions, Airbus Helicopters and BRL Ingénierie.</p>
      <p>They represent a large range of sectors: transports, infrastructure, industrial projects, aeronautics, utilities, logistics, energy (including renewable energy), ICT, water management, banking and financial services, service to government, among others.</p>
      <p>While speaking to the press at his residence, Jules-Armand Aniambossou, the Ambassador of France to Uganda said where need arises, the French firms can set up new firms to service unserved needs in Uganda which they have expertise in, in partnership with local players.</p>
      <p>“Trade between Uganda and France can definitely to better. We (France) do not believe that there can be development in Africa without SMEs, however, we should not forget the big companies,” Aniambossou said.</p>
      <p>Aniambossou revealed that the embassy is planning a day and a half return visit for Ugandan firms to meet and benchmark the very best French firms in Agriculture and Tourism at the sidelines of the 2020 Africa- France summit in Bordeaux. </p>
      <p>Stephen Kaboyo, the chairman of Total Uganda’s advisory round table and chairman of the Presidential Advisory Group said that the visit of MEDEF is a clear indication that Uganda is among Frances priority countries in Africa.</p>
      <p> “The MEDEF visit is a stamp of approval on the business climate in Uganda. This is an indication to the investors from around the world that Uganda is open for business,” Kaboyo said.</p>
      <p>He noted that there is a lot of room to improve Uganda’s imports from France of $40m and exports of $6.4m. </p>
      <p>In 2017, the MEDEF mission gathered 36 French firms of different sectors, particularly ICT, energy &amp; renewable energy, public works, infrastructure, transports, health, agri-business, petrochemical, and international trade among others.</p>
      <p>Ugandan’s fast developing economy, with growth at 6% in 2018 and its fast growing population were highlighted in the embassy’s statement as major factors for the interest of French companies in Uganda.  </p>
      <p>“The French companies are convinced of Uganda’s economic potential and investment opportunities,” the embassy said.</p>
      <p>“They are committed to initiate more and strong win-win partnership opportunities between French and Ugandan companies and to contribute to achieving long-term development objectives and growth,” it added.</p>
