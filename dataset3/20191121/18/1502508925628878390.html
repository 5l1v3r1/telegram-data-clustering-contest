      <p>Bollywood star <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sunny-leone">Sunny Leone </a>has bought a stake in the Leicester Galactos team of IPL Soccer, a celebrity-owned seven-a-side indoor football tournament held in the UK.</p>
      <p>Sunny's team is co-owned by Jaz Dhami.</p>
      <p>Sunny said: "Sports speak a global language and it's my pleasure that I get the chance to encourage emerging talent. IPL <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/soccer">Soccer </a>gives the right kind of exposure, facilities and platform to the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/soccer">soccer </a>players.</p>
      <p>Former England football star Micheal Owen brand ambassador of the league.</p>
      <p>"Sport is one of the few institutions that can break down barriers and stereotypes. Providing fully inclusive opportunities for all are at the core of the IPL <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/soccer">soccer </a>Programme," said Owen.</p>
      <p>The "Mastizaade" star recently posted the video of her kicking the ball at a goalpost, alongside the caption, "What's my name.. what's my name?"</p>
      <p>IPL Soccer founder Sany Supra expressed his joy on having <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/sunny-leone">Sunny Leone </a>on board.</p>
      <p>"Football and the Entertainment world together to showcase across the globe," he stated.</p>
      <p>The tournament helmed in UK will flag off in June 2020.</p>
