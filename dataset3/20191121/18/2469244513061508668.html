      <p>The Westcountry’s two biggest universities have been awarded the highest national honours for their pioneering work on plastics pollution.</p>
      <p>Today’s Queen’s Anniversary Prize for Higher Education – the top honour that can go to an academic institution – recognises the University of Exeter for the pivotal role it has played to expose the devastating effect of plastics pollution on the health of humans and wildlife.</p>
      <p>And the University of Plymouth is awarded the Queen’s Anniversary Prize for its ground-breaking research on microplastics pollution in the oceans.</p>
      <p>The honours have been approved by The Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>Sir Damon Buffani, the chairman of The Royal Anniversary Trust, said: “The Prizes are granted every two years by the Queen and are the most prestigious national honour awarded to UK universities and colleges for their work. </p>

      <h3>The plastic on your plate</h3>
      <p>Exeter’s pioneering research into microplastics pollution in the oceans has focused on a series of in-depth studies into the global impact plastics of micro and nano-plastics – small plastic particles less than 1mm in length – which are increasingly contaminating the natural environment.</p>
      <p>This pollution can have implications for the rest of the food chain, including humans.</p>
      <p>The work has been led by Professors Tamara Galloway, Brendan Godley, Lorna Harries and Dr Ceri Lewis.</p>
      <p>The research project has played a leading role in shaping the worldwide blueprint, not only for reducing the use of microbeads in cosmetics, but also directing a clarion call to action to tackle the modern “throwaway culture” which has led to vast floating islands of plastic waste plaguing many of the world’s oceans.</p>
      <p>The impact on human health has most recently been shown in one strand of the research project that showed that 86 per cent of Devon teenagers have traces of bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical compound used to make plastics, in their body.  Measurable levels of BPA, an endocrine-disrupting chemical, were found in the urine of the vast majority of the 94 17-19 year olds tested. These results supported calls for better labelling of packaging to enable consumers to choose BPA-free products.</p>
      <p>Prof Galloway, one of the world’s leading experts in microplastics research, said: “ It feels wonderful to be a part of this prestigious award. I’m passionate about protecting the environment and am constantly amazed at the positive global reception our research has had.</p>
      <p>“I’m so proud of all the researchers in my team whose hard work has been recognised and grateful to our many, many collaborators, locally and from all around the world, for their fantastic support.’</p>
      <p>Prof Lorna Harries, an expert in the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals on gene expression and regulation, said: “I am delighted that our work in this area has been recognised.  It is so good to see that by doing what we love, we may be able to make a contribution to the health of our population and our planet.”</p>
      <p>The University of Exeter last won the award in 2007 in recognition of its expertise in transforming the lives of hundreds of diabetes sufferers. In 1996,  the Dean of the then Peninsula Medical School, Professor John Tooke, won a Queen’s Prize for work on diabetes research, while in 1998 the university also secured an award for its research into children’s health and exercise.</p>
      <p>Professor Sir Steve Smith, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Exeter, said: “The whole of the university is honoured and delighted to win this prestigious award.</p>
      <p>“The pivotal research carried out by our world-class team of experts in this field has already had a crucial impact in showing just how detrimental plastics and  microplastic pollution is to the natural environment.</p>
      <p>“It has also played a significant role in challenging us all to think about how we use plastic in our everyday lives, and find ways to reduce its use. We congratulate the whole team for their success with this richly deserved award.”</p>

      <h3>Lost at Sea - how Plymouth woke the world</h3>
      <p>The University of Plymouth as been at the centre of nearly two decades of world-leading research which has</p>
      <p>resulted in repeated scientific breakthroughs and influenced national and</p>
      <p>international legislation.</p>
      <p>The work has been led by Professor Richard Thompson, who was made an OBE for his services to marine science in 2018, and was this week named once again among the world’s most highly cited researchers by the Web of Science Group.</p>
      <p>Prof Thompson said: “The work we have done has had a really major role in raising awareness of the topic, acting as a tipping point for the academic community, as well as for industry, policy and the general public.</p>
      <p>“Many people, past and present at the university, nationally and internationally, have made an invaluable contribution to the work we have done over nearly 20 years, and the Queen’s Anniversary Prize is reward for our endeavours, achievements and commitment.”</p>
      <p>It is the third time that the University of Plymouth has been given a Queen’s Anniversary Prize. The last occasion was in 2012 when the university was recognised for the breadth and excellence of its marine and maritime research, teaching and training.</p>

      <p>Professor Judith Petts, the Vice-Chancellor, said: “The award is a huge honour for the university and recognises the pioneering role that it has played in not only defining a global environmental issue, but working to find solutions to it.</p>
      <p>“Challenges on this scale require a coordinated response at a societal level, and what really sets the institution apart is its willingness to engage with all parties in a bid to stimulate change.</p>
      <p>“Richard Thompson and his team’s work in microplastics, indeed defining the very problem itself, is part of the university’s wider and globally renowned marine and maritime research, which addresses some of the world’s most pressing issues.”</p>
      <p>Microplastics first came to the world’s attention after a 2004 paper published in the journal <i>Science</i> , in which Professor Thompson and his team showed that levels of microscopic plastic debris in plankton had been rising since the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The paper, Lost at Sea: Where is all the Plastic? was the first to answer the question of why, even though the amount of plastic waste generated was rising  exponentially, there was no clear increase in plastic debris in the environment.</p>
      <p>The paper attracted global media coverage, and inspired a new field of scientific enquiry, with Professor Thompson and his team at the forefront.</p>
      <p>Since then they have shows that  microplastics are being distributed around the globe, including in the Arctic and the deep ocean, and they are eaten by fish and other marine life.</p>
      <p>The team has also investigated the role that textiles and wastewater play – with a single wash of clothing releases more than 700,000 microfibers; and some facial scrubs could contain up to 2.8 million microbeads.</p>
      <p>The university’s interdisciplinary International Marine Litter Research Unit also considers public attitudes and behavioural aspects in relation to plastic and the marine environment.</p>
      <p>The University of Plymouth has influenced new legislation in the UK, Europe and Canada, including the ban on microbeads in cosmetics.</p>
