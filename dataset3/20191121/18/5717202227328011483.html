      <h1>Jose Mourinho builds up youngster Japhet Tanganga in first Tottenham training session</h1>
      <h2>The Portuguese boss does not have much of a reputation for developing young talent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:45:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>New Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho does not have a great reputation for developing young talent in his previous jobs.</p>
      <p>It something he has already sought to address in his first days in charge, with the<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7707747/Jose-Mourinho-vows-develop-Tottenham-young-players-happier.html"> Daily Mail</a> quoting him saying: “There’s not one manager in the world that doesn’t like to play young players and to help young players to develop.”</p>
      <p>And now a clip has emerged on Twitter of Mourinho talking up 20-year-old defender Japhet Tanganga to a fellow coach on his first day of training.</p>
      <p>Mourinho brought up the fact the defender marked Cristiano Ronaldo and was heard saying ‘make him known’ during his first session.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Tottenham could do with another young defender but Mourinho tends to prefer experience</h3>
      <p>With Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld’s contracts expiring at the end of the season, Tottenham need new defensive blood coming through to replenish their backline.</p>
      <p>Davinson Sanchez and Juan Foyth should form part of the defensive plans for the future and Tanganga showed in pre-season that he has the talent to do the same.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho’s history indicates he will prefer the experience of the Belgian duo, and perhaps look into renewing their contracts, rather than promoting youth.</p>
      <p>Tanganga should be enthused by the fact that Mourinho has clearly looked into his past and taken an interest in him, but time will tell whether Mourinho furthers his career.</p>
