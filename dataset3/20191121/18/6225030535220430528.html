      <p>Officials for Santa Anita Park were told at Thursday’s California Horse Racing Board meeting that the track must agree to three conditions before being granted a license to conduct its winter-spring meet that traditionally opens the day after Christmas.</p>
      <p>Dr. Greg Ferraro, who earlier in the meeting was elected new chairman of CHRB, notified acting Santa Anita boss Aiden Butler the track must agree to not allow racing or training in inclement weather, card no claiming races under $10,000, and bar horses who have received corticosteriod injections in the fetlock from racing for 30 days or training for 10 days.</p>
      <p>These requirements of Santa Anita were outlined during the meeting of the CHRB in Del Mar that attracted several anti-horse racing protesters during the public comment periods. Shortly after a lunch break, the CHRB also voted to postpone to the next meeting on Dec. 12 any action on proposed rule changes for the use of riding crops in the state.</p>
      <p>When laying out the conditions for Santa Anita’s license, Ferraro told Butler he “expects” Santa Anita to return in December with “instructions into how that is actually going to be implemented.</p>
      <p>“The board will hear those specific parameters and clearly they will have to be acceptable. Is that agreeable?” Ferraro asked.</p>
      <p>“Absolutely,” Butler replied.</p>
      <p>With that, the board voted to approve Santa Anita’s racing license contingent on meeting the stated conditions.</p>
      <p>Ferraro, a longtime racetrack veterinarian and former director of the UC Davis Center for Equine Health, noted politicians in the state capital have a close eye on horse racing and following these requirements are key.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of pressure from Sacramento,” Ferraro said. “But I can tell you based on my conversations with Sacramento that if these procedures and protocols are put in place and enforced, the governor has no reason to not allow racing to continue. But It’s very important that we continue forward with the protocols we have discussed.”</p>

          <u>Whip Rules</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>There are two proposals being considered by the CHRB that would limit the use of riding crops in racing and training. However, largely because of the announcement this week of the new Thoroughbred Safety Coalition, which includes various industry stakeholders, the board voted to take no action.</p>
      <p>In explaining his vote to postpone, Commissioner and Hall of Fame jockey Alex Solis said he is concerned the rules for riding crop usage in California could get too far out of line with other jurisdictions.</p>
      <p>“I feel with the Thoroughbred Safety Coalition, we need to work with them,” Solis said. “All be in line and have the same rules in every state.</p>
      <p>Among anticipated reforms for the Coalition -- which includes The Stronach Group and Del Mar, among other entities that host 85% of American graded stakes -- is to "adopt a uniform riding-crop rule, limiting crop use and defining crop specifications."</p>
      <p>“This industry’s survival is dependent on betting,” Solis said later. “And we all know a gambler needs very little excuse not to bet on a racetrack for whatever reason. If we go to do something nobody else is doing, it’s going to cost a lot to the industry and it’s going to cost a lot of revenue to the state of California. We have to keep that in mind too.”</p>
      <p><b><u>In Other News<br/></u></b>• Ferraro succeeded the recently-retired Chuck Winner as chairman of the CHRB. He was appointed to the board in June by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Ferraro, who is widely respected in the horse racing industry, said the CHRB’s focus will be on making the sport safer.</p>
      <p>“Health and safety is the No. 1 mandate from the governor,” Ferraro said. “I intend to fully carry out that mandate.</p>
      <p>“We have made several important new regulations and changes. There are many more to come. The ones that are destined to come are going to be more difficult than the ones we’ve passed.</p>
      <p>“The days of permissive medication are over,” Ferraro continued. “We will gradually eliminate medications and keep them from racing days and training. We expect opposition, but we intend to carry them out in the best interest of horses and jockeys.”</p>
      <p>• Commissioner Oscar Gonzales, who joined the board in September, was elected vice-chairman.</p>
      <p>• The board passed a rule requiring trainers and assistant trainers to complete 12 hours of continuing education every 36 months. Non-compliance would result in the non-renewal of a racing license.</p>
      <p>“We have certainly relied on the art of training horses, but I think it’s time we demand the understanding of the science of training horses as well,” said Dr. Rick Arthur, equine medical director of the CHRB.</p>
      <p>• The board also delayed acting on a proposal that would require the medical records of a claimed horse to be sent to the new attending veterinarian. The decision to delay follows a proposal from The Stronach Group that calls for a more comprehensive exchange of medical records than is currently proposed.</p>
      <p>• In his final executive director’s report, outgoing Executive Director Rick Baedeker said that to date there have been 23 fewer daytime racing programs in the state than last year and wagering is down 10.2% from a year ago.</p>
