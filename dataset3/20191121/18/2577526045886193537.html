      <h1>Half-Life: Alyx Takes Place Between Half-Life 1 And Half-Life 2</h1>

      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, you might be dismayed to learn, is definitely not <i>Half-Life 3</i>. But it is a new “full-length” <i>Half-Life </i>game, Valve said today, and it’ll be out in March.</p>
      <p>In a press release, Valve said the game – <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/19/valve-announces-new-half-life-game">first announced earlier this week</a> to surprise, confusion, and memes <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/19/the-internet-reacts-to-the-announcement-of-a-new-half-life-game">from fans</a> – has been “designed from the ground up for virtual reality,” but is still very much a<i> Half-Life</i> game in that it features “world exploration, puzzle solving, visceral combat, and an intricately woven story that connects it all with the characters iconic to the <i>Half-Life </i>universe.”</p>

      <p>It’s set between the events of <i>Half-Life 1 </i>and <i>2 </i>and stars Alyx, as the title suggests.</p>
      <p>“Alyx Vance and her father Eli secretly mount the resistance to the brutal occupation of Earth by a mysterious alien race known as The Combine,” reads the game’s description. “As Alyx, players take the fight to the Combine to save the future of humanity.”</p>

      <p>Despite ostensibly being a killer app for Valve’s own VR headset, <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/07/02/valve-index-is-luxurious-but-a-hassle">the Valve Index</a>, <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be compatible with “all PC-based VR headsets” when it releases in March 2020. Screenshots thus far depict Alyx having hands, which is something that was technically already canon, but now her hands are your hands, and you get to use items like the enticingly named “gravity gloves.” If they are not somehow involved in a game of fetch with Dog, I’ll eat a Vortigaunt.</p>
