      <p>The Rabbitohs could become a serious player in the market following the retirement of Sam Burgess due to a recurring shoulder injury, but are still waiting to hear from the NRL whether they will receive salary cap dispensation for the English star’s contract which was worth around $1 million per season.</p>
      <p>Radradra has recently been linked with a move to Redfern, while Canterbury expressed interest before he represented Fiji in the Rugby World Cup.</p>

      <p>Radradra met with Bulldogs powerbrokers before the tournament kicked off to express an interest in luring back to the code in 2021 after his deal runs out with French rugby club Bordeaux.</p>
      <p>But France’s cold weather and family reasons are said to be factors in Radradra’s wish to move back to the Southern Hemisphere as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>According to the <i>Telegraph</i>, a third party is acting between Radradra and NRL clubs with the former Kangaroos flyer happy to field offers around $500,000 per season.</p>
      <p>Radradra’s former coach Brad Arthur has also publicly stated he’d be keen to bring the powerhouse player back to Parramatta where he scored 82 tries in 94 games.</p>

      <p>Should Radradra join the Rabbitohs, it would give Wayne Bennett a huge selection headache given the club already boasts a host of outside backs like James Roberts, Dane Gagai, Alex Johnston, Adam Doueihi, Campbell Graham, Corey Allan and Bryson Goodwin.</p>

      <p>When asked about the speculation, Damien Cook told <i>Sporting News</i>: “Apparently Souths are looking at every player but first we’ve got to sort out what the go is with Sam (Burgess).</p>
      <p>“But Semi Radradra is a quality player and he did a great job when he was in the NRL.</p>
      <p>“He’d be a great asset to most clubs.</p>
      <p>“Who knows (what will happen)? We will see how it plays out.”</p>
