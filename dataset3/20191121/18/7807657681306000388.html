      <p>Bing aims to clear confusion and present relevant data to help voters in the U.S. 2020 election. A new Bing 2020 U.S. Elections Experience is now in beta, bringing in facts, quotes, and figures from several news sources and websites. The experience aims to present large amounts of relevant information in a single place that's easy to find. A <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/search/december-2019/The-New-Bing-Elections-Experience?ocid=SCCEducation_soc_bin___Text__BingElections">Bing blog post</a> breaks down the new election experience.</p>
      <p>When you search a candidate on Bing, the search engine gathers information from news articles, official candidate websites, and non-partisan partners like VoteSmart.org. The information is curated into easily digestible blocks of information on the search results page.</p>
      <p>Political elections are a tricky time for people seeking information. Bing's election experience includes candidates' stances on issues "in their own words, from various sources." In addition to quotes and other information, the Bing election experience will show a summary of each candidate's voting record on congressional bills.</p>
      <p>The beta experience is exclusive to U.S. elections at this time, though Microsoft may expand it in the future.</p>

Why is the November 2019 Update so small, and how does it differ from previous Windows 10 feature updates? You have questions, and we have the answers. Version 1909 is a new type of Windows 10 feature update for Microsoft, as all its features are actually already built-in to the previous version of Windows 10, but are off until you install version 1909.</a>
