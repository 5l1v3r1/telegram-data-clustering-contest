      <h1>Tom Brady’s attitude for salvaging Patriots offense</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:02:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jaclyn Hendricks</a></address>
      <p>For Tom Brady, it doesn’t sound like 9-1 is good enough, even after the Patriots won a Super Bowl LII rematch against the Eagles on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“It’s great to be 9-1, but we just have high expectations for what we’re doing as an offense,” Brady said, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2019/11/21/tom-brady-new-england-patriots-offense/4257343002/">according to USA Today</a>. “We’re just trying to figure out how we can do things consistently with dependability. Guys are working hard at it. Sometimes it comes together early, middle of the season, late in the season.”</p>
      <p>Brady was displeased after Sunday’s performance, completing 26 of 47 passes for 216 yards in the 17-10 victory. The Cowboys are the next challenge ahead for the Patriots, who could be without veteran receivers Mohamed Sanu and Phillip Dorsett, <a href="https://www.masslive.com/patriots/2019/11/tom-brady-recognizing-patriots-offense-doesnt-have-to-be-great-just-good-enough-to-compliment-dynamic-defense.html">both of whom missed practice Wednesday</a>.</p>
      <p>“The only thing that matters is this week and trying to beat a really good football team,” Brady said. “I don’t know what shape it’s going to take this particular week.”</p>
      <p>New England has become something of a revolving door for playmakers this season, as Antonio Brown was cut from the team in September amid sexual assault allegations, and Josh Gordon was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/01/seahawks-pluck-josh-gordon-off-waivers/">claimed off waivers</a> by Seattle in November. Tight end Rob Gronkowski recently silenced comeback chatter <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/19/gronk-is-heading-to-miami-for-super-bowl-2020/">with the announcement of a Super Bowl bash</a> in Miami for February.</p>
      <p>With a possible playoff run ahead, Brady believes it’s all hands on deck.</p>
      <p>“The goal is the same — as an offense, go out there and score points and not go out there and run a bunch of plays and be ineffective,” he said. “We’re working hard to try to be as effective as we can.”</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if the seventh-ranked Cowboys defense will pose as a formidable threat.</p>
