      <p>"Everyone has been in full training and that is testament to the medical and sports science team buying into my methods.</p>
      <p>"It is perfect timing to have a clean bill of health in the squad.</p>
      <p>"We are about to come into our busiest period of the season. These next two to three months are hectic."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Monk continued: "There are games everywhere and everyone is going to have to be ready. There could be injuries or suspensions so everyone is going to be called upon. Everyone's job is to be ready.</p>
      <p>"We have done some good, hard work over the international break and to come through it with a clean bill of health bodes for the coming period.</p>
      <p>"Decisions are part of the job. You always make decisions that you feel are best for the team and that game.”</p>
      <p>Wednesday head into the game in eighth position, eight points behind West Brom in top spot.</p>
