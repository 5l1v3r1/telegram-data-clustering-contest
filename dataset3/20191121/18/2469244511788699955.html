      <p>Freemasons have donated £25,000 to support charities and organisations across Devon.</p>
      <p>Each Spring and Autumn Freemasons from Devon meet to support organisations and charities who require financial assistance, amongst those included are schools, youth centres and charities including hospices, hospital services and cancer charities.</p>
      <p>The money is raised through the ‘WAKE FUND’ a trust conceived by Right Worshipful Brother William Alexander Kneel, the Provincial Grand Master of Devonshire from 1970 to 1984, the late owner of Kneels laundry and dry cleaners - now Johnsons. Since the idea was initiated, the Devonshire Freemasons have donated £2million, from which the trustees distribute the income generated, currently £50,000 each year.</p>
      <p>Since the first disbursement in 2001 almost £770,000 has been given to over 868 non-masonic organisations and charities throughout Devon, selected by members of the 131 Masonic lodges based throughout the county.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Rt. W. Bro. Ian Kingsbury, JP. Provincial Grand Master for the Devonshire Freemasons presented cheques to 20 causes at the meeting held at The Masonic Hall, St. Andrews Road Exmouth.</p>
      <p>The charity representatives accompanied by a member from their nominating lodge were greeted with reception and buffet as well as a tour of the lodge building and had the opportunity to ask questions.</p>
      <p>Making the contributions, Ian Kingsbury said: “I am delighted that the Freemasons of Devon can continue to contribute to these important local causes many of which are run by volunteers and hopefully these donations will make a real difference to the lives of many people.</p>
      <p>“Among the organisations that will benefit are Street Vets, Plymouth, Shekinah Mission Plymouth, Ivybridge Community Transport Assoc, Plymouth Raiders Wheelchair Basketball Club, Exeter Gateway Centre, No.17 Exeter Foyer, Exeter Saracens Under 11 Rugby Team, Veterans with Dogs Exeter, Sid Vale Memory Cafe, Exmouth Gateway Club, Axmouth Playground Assoc.
