      <h1>'Different' - Preston boss Alex Neil offers his take on Derby County struggles</h1>
      <h2>Derby County latest - The Rams have endured a tough start to the season and this weekend go up against a high-flying Preston North End</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Kemble</a></address>
      <p>Preston North End boss Alex Neil has described <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Dery County</a> as 'different from last season'.</p>
      <p>Neil's high-flying Lilywhites <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-press-conference-headache-3561686">take on the Rams on Saturday afternoon at Pride Park</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/preston-north-end-fc">Preston</a> head into the clash high in confidence, sitting second in the table, just two points behind leaders West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Derby are down in 16th and with just one win from their last three games.</p>
      <p>The transition has proved difficult for the Rams after the arrival of new boss Phillip Cocu in the summer, and they look a long way from the play-off final side of last season.</p>

      <p>But why have they struggled? Preston boss Neil had his say during his press conference this week.</p>
      <p>He said: "They are different from last season, they have lost a lot of their loan players which was always going to make it difficult for them.</p>
      <p>“I think if they had the same players they had last year they would be higher up in the league now.”</p>
