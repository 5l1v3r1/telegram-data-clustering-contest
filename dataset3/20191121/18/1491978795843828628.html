        <i>Brexit party leader tells evangelical Christian TV channel of threat from ‘globalists’ and mass migration</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nigel-farage">Nigel Farage</a> has faced renewed criticism for discussing tropes and conspiracy theories associated with the far right and antisemitism after it emerged he said migration would “imperil the future of our civilisation” and called Goldman Sachs “the enemy”.</p>
      <p>In an interview earlier this year with a tiny UK evangelical Christian TV channel, Revelation TV, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/brexit-party">Brexit party</a> leader alleged that banks and multinational corporations were trying to created a dictatorial world government.</p>
      <p>The discussion, uncovered by the group Hope Not Hate, saw Farage single out Goldman Sachs, the investment bank founded by Jewish immigrant to the US that is often the focus of antisemitic conspiracy theories.</p>
      <p>Farage also repeatedly used phrases such as “globalists” and “new world order”, which regularly feature in antisemitic ideas.</p>
      <p>Discussing the necessity of preventing migrants who cross the Mediterranean into Europe from entering the UK, Farage said: “If we allow it to continue, we will actually, through our compassion, imperil the future of our civilisation.”</p>
      <p>The notion that European countries will have their cultures superseded by mass immigration is a repeated element of far-right ideas, such as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/05/great-replacement-theory-alt-right-killers-el-paso">so-called “great replacement” theory</a>.</p>
      <p>Farage has talked little about immigration or culture during an election campaign in which coverage of the Brexit party has largely focused on his decision to not stand for a parliamentary seat and to withdraw hundreds of candidates from Conservative-held seats.</p>
      <p>However, the emergence of the footage, from an interview broadcast by Revelation TV, has reignited criticism of Farage’s judgment, and his willingness to engage in discussion of conspiracy theories associated with the far right and antisemitism.</p>
      <p>In May, Farage was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/06/nigel-farage-under-fire-alleged-antisemitic-tropes-far-right-us-talkshow-alex-jones">criticised by the UK’s leading Jewish organisations</a> after it emerged he had repeatedly taken part in interviews with a far-right US talkshow host, openly discussing similar conspiracy theories about a plot for a global government.</p>
      <p>Farage undertook six interviews with Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/17/alex-jones-sued-infowars-sandy-hook-parents-defamation">sued by bereaved parents</a> after claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook US school shooting was faked.</p>
      <p>He later faced renewed criticism from Jewish groups and others after it emerged he also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/12/farage-criticised-for-using-antisemitic-themes-to-criticise-soros">repeatedly used themes associated with antisemitism</a> to criticise the financier George Soros.</p>
      <p>The Brexit party leader has previously declined to engage with the criticisms, with a party spokesman having called the accusations “pathetic”. Farage’s representatives were contacted again for comment.</p>
      <p>The latest interview, broadcast in February, was with Revelation TV, which has previously faced criticism from Ofcom for anti-Islam content, and fined by regulators in Spain, where it also airs, over homophobic comments.</p>
      <p>Introducing the interview, one of the channel’s hosts described Brexit as “a divine miracle, God-inspired, God-initiated”.</p>
      <p>In the discussion, Farage argued that “the globalists” were trying to thwart Brexit and Donald Trump, among others, and that multinational businesses were seeking to introduce a world government with no democracy.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs, Farage said, “actually see the European Union as, basically, the forerunner of global government. That’s what these people are pushing for. It’s pretty clear who the enemy is, as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Hope Not Hate, which campaigns against the far right, called Farage’s comments “disgusting”.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s not dog-whistle racism if you’re just coming out and saying it. This talk of ‘imperil our civilisation’ is the language more commonly heard from Farage’s far-right allies in Germany and Italy.”</p>
      <p>David Lammy, the Labour candidate for Tottenham, said: “It is shocking but unsurprising that Nigel Farage has been caught out spreading far-right conspiracy theories on an Islamophobic and homophobic TV channel.</p>
      <p>“Farage has a long history of casual racism and xenophobia. However, this interview proves beyond doubt that these were not slip-ups, but the result of an ideologically racist worldview.”</p>
      <p>Wes Streeting, standing for Labour in Ilford North, said: “No one should be in any doubt that Nigel Farage has serious form when it comes to peddling conspiracy theories and stoking prejudice for political gain. People should think twice before rewarding this ugly politics with their vote.”</p>
