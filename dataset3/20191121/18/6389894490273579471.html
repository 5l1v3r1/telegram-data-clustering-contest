      <p>The social media giant today said it had agreed a takeover of the London-based startup, which provides a cross-platform advertising command centre, for an undisclosed sum.</p>
      <p>Announcing the deal, Twitter’s vice president of revenue product Bruce Falck said his company was “very impressed with their [Aiden’s] forward-looking team and the innovative technology their platform houses”.</p>
      <p>“This technology is a first step in helping us better unlock Twitter for small businesses as we improve our self-serve offerings over time for our customers,” he added.</p>
      <p>The acquisition highlights Twitter’s efforts to tap into potential advertising revenue from the millions of small businesses using its platform.</p>
      <p>It also marks the expansion of Twitter’s team in London, as the tech giant attempts to decentralise its business.</p>
      <p>Aiden was founded in Fitzrovia in 2016 by Marie Outtier and PJ Camillieri and secured an initial $750,000 (£581,000) seed round led by Kima Ventures.</p>
