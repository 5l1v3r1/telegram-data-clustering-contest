      <h1>Iowa Football Releases Awesome Senior Day Graphic</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:03:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>This weekend, Iowa’s football program will honor the seniors on its roster when it hosts Illinois. With kickoff still a few days away, the Hawkeyes posted an awesome graphic on social media for their upperclassmen.</p>
      <p>Iowa is coming off its biggest win of the season. Last Saturday, Kirk Ferentz led the team to a statement victory over previously undefeated Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Next up for Iowa is a clash against Illinois on senior day.</p>
      <p>The Hawkeyes made a graphic for their seniors which depicts them as members of The Avengers.</p>
      <p>Since there are 19 seniors on the roster this season, it definitely took time for the program’s social media team to put this together. Fortunately for Iowa, there are a lot of Marvel characters to choose from.</p>
      <p>Here’s the graphic for senior day:</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Out of all the illustrations on this graphic, it’s hard to find a better one than Nathan Stanley as Stan Lee. This isn’t just a play on words by the Hawkeyes, they’re paying tribute to the leader of their football team.</p>
      <p>Iowa will need to keep its emotions in check on senior day in order to avoid an upset loss to Illinois.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. ET from Kinnick Stadium.</p>
      <p>Fans can watch Iowa’s seniors take the field on the Big Ten Network.</p>
