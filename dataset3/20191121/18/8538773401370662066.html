      <p><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/77653/Gareth-Bale">Gareth Bale</a>'s agent has told ESPN FC he has "no worries" about how Real Madrid fans will react to his <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog-the-toe-poke/story/3993496/gareth-balewales-teammates-hold-up-walesgolfmadrid-banner-after-qualifying-for-euro-2020">"Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" flag celebration</a>.</p>
      <p>Wales captain Bale was pictured laughing with teammates while posing with the fan-made banner after his country qualified for Euro 2020 on Tuesday <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/match?gameId=528848">with a win against Hungary</a>.</p>
      <p>The image has been met with an angry reaction in the Spanish media -- <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/real-madrid/story/3994362/sources-gareth-bale-flag-celebration-a-bad-joke-real-madrid">with the club calling it a bad joke</a> -- but the player's representative Jonathan Barnett told ESPN FC he's not concerned about the reception for Bale at the Bernabeu on Saturday when Madrid host Real Sociedad.</p>
      <p>The flag and celebration were "meant for the media" rather than being aimed at the club or its fanbase, he said.</p>
      <p>Members of the Madrid squad have told ESPN FC they were amused by the image, but believe it could damage Bale's relationship with fans.</p>
      <p>The front-page headline of Spain's biggest-selling sports newspaper Marca on Thursday read "Disrespectful. Misguided. Ungrateful. In that order" in reference to Bale's celebration.</p>
      <p>Madrid-based newspaper AS's front-page claimed that "the club and [coach Zinedine] Zidane fear the reaction of the fans."</p>

      <p>Bale returned from international duty to take part in full training with his Madrid teammates at the club's Valdebebas training ground on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He is expected to feature at the Bernabeu on Saturday having not played for Madrid since October, when he was injured playing for his country.</p>
      <p>Last week Bale admitted to feeling "more excitement playing for Wales" than he does for Madrid.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month Zidane dismissed the possibility of Bale leaving in January, saying he's counting on his involvement "until the end of the season."</p>
      <p>The former Tottenham player has been linked with a return to the club amid UK and Spanish media reports that new Spurs' boss Jose Mourinho sees <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/blog-transfer-talk/story/3994802/live-transfer-talk-jose-mourinho-aims-to-bring-gareth-bale-back-to-tottenham">Bale as a top target for the 2020 summer window</a>.</p>
