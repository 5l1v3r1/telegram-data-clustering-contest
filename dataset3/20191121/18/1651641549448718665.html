      <p>Windows 10 <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/november-patch-tuesday-update-is-here-heres-whats-new-for-windows-10/">Cumulative Update KB4524570 for Windows 10 November 2019 Update(Version 1909)</a> seems to have introduced a couple of fixes that are not even listed in the official changelog. We’ve recently reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/windows-10-users-are-experiencing-problems-when-trying-to-install-the-latest-cumulative-update-kb4524570-and-here-is-how-to-fix-them/">addressed the installation bug in the Cumulative Update KB4524570</a>, but apart from that, there is another fix that Microsoft forgot to mention in the changelog.</p>
      <p>Microsoft’s Windows 10 KB4524570 update has a fix for the Deferral settings bug. For those unaware, Deferral settings can be found in the Advanced Update options pane and it helps users block Windows 10 Update(including cumulative update) from installing a new version of Windows 10 for the specified number of days. The Windows 10 May 2019 Update(Version 1903) reportedly made the Deferral settings disappear from the Advanced Update options pane.</p>
      <p>“They have an odd bug with the deferal settings that was introduced in 1903 (mine is actually the opposite currently, I can see the setting for Feature Updates but not Quality Updates). Essentially it seems that you can pick that setting once, after you do so the setting item in the GUI will disappear entirely. It can be manually fixed by editing the registry key for it, but I have no idea why it hasn’t been patched yet,” a user wrote on Reddit.</p>
      <p>“I gave up on update deferral settings in the settings app and just set it with the group policies under “Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update &gt; Windows Update for Business”. I prefer it over setting the keys in the registry,” another user said.</p>
      <p>The bug has finally been fixed in the Windows 10 KB4524570 update, so if you’re one of those who like to delay Windows update will now be able to do so without any issue.</p>
