      <h1>Tema General Hospital takes hand washing a notch higher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:50:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author">James Amoh Jnr, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Tema, Nov. 21, GNA – The Tema General Hospital has taken the lead in hygienic hand washing by advocating and insisting on patients and clients to wash their hands each time they visit or exit the hospital premises.</p>
      <p>Hand washing with soap, practised regularly, is the single most effective way of preventing the spread of infectious diseases and the promotion of healthy living. </p>
      <p>During a visit by the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Tema, it was observed that the main entrance of the hospital, where individuals walked in and out daily, a paramedic clad in an all-white uniform, was seen demonstrating the simplicity and value of clean hands to some clients who were exiting.</p>
      <p>Two coverable buckets, connected with hand faucet and spaced in an interval has; disinfectant soaps, hand sanitizers, tissues for wiping washed hands and a receptacle for collecting used tissues at both ends.</p>
      <p>Madam Faustina Boadu, a paramedic in her early 50s, was spotted with a smile passionately educating some persons who were exiting the hospital premises, on the need to efficiently wash their hands thoroughly with soap and running water on entering the hospital and immediately after leaving.   </p>
      <p>The life-saving initiative by the hospital, she indicated was meant to reduce and ultimately prevent the spread of infections.</p>
      <p>According to her, good hand washing included; using an adequate amount of disinfectant soap, robbing the hands together to create friction and rinsing properly under running water to prevent disease transmission.</p>
      <p>Madam Boadu, said regular hand washing, was non-negotiable and there was urgent need for an intensified education in basic schools to teach pupils the importance of clean hand.</p>
      <p>Chairman of Community Score Card, a participatory and community based monitoring outfit, Mr Bob Amiteye, speaking to the GNA after queuing to wash his hands, said the initiative was commendable as that would curtail cross contamination and transmission of infections.</p>
      <p>He however indicated that a foot operated or censor powered taps would be more appropriate to serve the purpose rather than hand faucet, which had the tendency of spreading infections due to the pressure on the facility.</p>
      <p>He said that even though the facility was phenomenal, it was not disability friendly, which posed as a challenge, explaining that “an improved facility to give access to physically challenged persons was the way to go”.</p>
      <p>Mr Boadu indicated that Community Score Card was a tool primarily meant to monitor service providers to deliver quality service and to ensure accountability and transparency at all levels.</p>
