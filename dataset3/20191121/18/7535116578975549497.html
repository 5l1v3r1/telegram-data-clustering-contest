      <p>Looks like there may be another contraceptive method for us soon! The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has announced that they have successfully completed clinical trials of the world‚Äôs first injectable male contraceptive and this could be available for mass production in just six months.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-closer-to-world-s-first-male-contraceptive-injection/story-o3lTFLnCkKHpuEDNNqrEnO.html">Hindustan Times</a>, <b>this contraception is effective for 13 years and is supposed to be a replacement for surgical vasectomy.</b> Currently, surgical vasectomy is the only male sterilisation method available in the world and this new method is done through an injection to the genitals.</p>
      <p>ICMR has sent the results over to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) and is now waiting for approval. ‚ÄúThe product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending with the Drugs Controller. The trials are over, including extended, phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side-effects. The product can safely be called the world‚Äôs first male contraceptive,‚Äù said Dr RS Sharma, senior scientist with ICMR, who has been leading the research.</p>

      <p>This is slated to be the first in the world as other male contraceptives are still under development. There was previously a male contraceptive that showed promise in 2016 but was stopped because it produced side effects such as acne and mood changes. Meanwhile, these side effects are similar to those experienced by women on female contraceptives.</p>
      <p>This contraceptive can be injected under local anaesthesia and is described as a polymer, known as reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG) made of a compound called Styrene Maleic Anhydride. A registered medical professional will inject it at the sperm-containing tube near the testicles (vas deferens) and <b>the polymer will block the tube so no sperm is delivered to the penis.</b></p>

      <p>This polymer has been extensively developed and researched since the 1970s. The effects will slowly wear off in 13 years and Dr Sharma says that this can be known as the first male contraceptive. VG Somani, the drug controller general of India said that they have to be extra careful as it‚Äôs the first of its kind.</p>
      <p>They want to make sure that it‚Äôs of good quality and waiting for all approvals to be granted before they proceed to mass manufacture it. <b>This will likely take about six to seven months before it is approved to be manufactured.</b> This product has been in research since 1984 and it looks like it may hit the shelves sooner than you expect!</p>
