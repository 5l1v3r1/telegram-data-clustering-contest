      <p>A rabid Ohio animal rights activist previously busted for trying to hire a hitman to kill a stranger wearing fur is now accused of stabbing a woman inside a church — because she too was wearing a pelt coat, officials said.</p>
      <p>Meredith Lowell, 35, was charged with attempted murder and assault in connection with the slashing Wednesday at Fairmount Presbyterian Church in Cleveland Heights, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/crime/2019/11/animal-rights-activist-stabbed-woman-inside-cleveland-heights-church-because-she-was-wearing-a-fur-police-say.html">Cleveland.com reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Police said Lowell allegedly attacked a babysitter who was dropping off children at the church for choir practice.</p>
      <p>The babysitter was waiting for the kids’ practice to begin when Lowell “suddenly appeared” and assaulted her, a witness <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/oh-cuyahoga/woman-who-allegedly-stabbed-woman-inside-church-was-charged-in-2012-for-hiring-hitman-to-kill-fur-wearer">told news station WEWS</a>.</p>
      <p>Officers arrived to find the victim on the ground in a pool of blood, while another churchgoer restrained Lowell, according to the report.</p>
      <p>A yellow kitchen knife was recovered from the ground near the activist, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The babysitter was brought to the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center with two stab wounds to her arm and one in the abdomen, Cleveland.com reported.</p>
      <p>Lowell was booked at Cleveland Heights City Jail, where she’s awaiting her first court appearance, the outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Police said they believe Lowell was provoked by the victim’s fur coat, since she was previously arrested for attempting to hire a hitman in 2012 on Facebook to kill a random fur-wearer.</p>
      <p>The charges were dismissed a year later because it was ruled that she was incompetent to stand trial, WEWS reported.</p>
