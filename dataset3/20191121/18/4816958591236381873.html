      <h1>Prince Andrew: I’m innocent because I can’t sweat. Dermatologists: Oh, really?</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew said a 'peculiar medical condition' arising from the Falklands War refutes Virginia Giuffre's claim he was 'dripping from sweat' when they danced in 2001</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:36:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:36</time> by <a rel="author">Bryan Meler</a></address>
      <p>In an interview on Saturday with BBC’s Emily Maitlis, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/world/in-wake-of-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-prince-andrew-to-step-away-from-public-life">Prince Andrew</a>, spoke about the allegations that  he had sex with then 17-year-old Virginia Roberts.</p>
      <p>The sexual encounter was <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2895735/The-account-masseuse-centre-explosive-Prince-Andrew-sex-slave-drama-telling-truth.html">allegedly forced upon Roberts</a> by the now deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a long time friend of Prince Andrew. </p>
      <p>During the interview, Prince Andrew described as false both the accusation and Roberts’ claim that Prince Andrew was<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/11343993/Diary-of-Virginia-Roberts-reveals-details-of-her-contact-with-Duke-of-York.html"> “dripping from sweat”</a> when they danced in London’s Club Tramp in 2001.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew said this couldn’t possibly be true because during at time in his life, he couldn’t sweat:</p>
      <p>“There’s a slight problem with the sweating. I have a peculiar medical condition … I didn’t sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at, and I simply — it was almost impossible for me to sweat. And it’s only because I have done a number of things in the recent past that I am starting to be able to do that again. So I’m afraid to say that there’s a medical condition that says that I didn’t do it.”</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew served on the British aircraft carrier HMS <i>Invincible </i>as a Sea King helicopter co-pilot during the Falklands War after Argentina invaded the British protectorate on April 2, 1982.</p>
      <p>The National Post spoke to two Canadian dermatologists familiar with sweat related problems to find out whether there’s any validity to Prince Andrew’s assertion. </p>
      <p>Dr. Mark Lupin, a dermatologist who acts as a clinical instructor at the University of British Columbia, said he was skeptical.</p>
      <p>“It is implausible to the point of being impossible that an ‘overdose of adrenaline’ could cause a persistent inability to sweat; there are no human studies nor is there reasonable science to back up this claim,” said Lupin in an email to the Post. “The claim that an overdose of adrenaline has led to the inability to sweat does not make sense.”</p>
      <p>There are medical conditions that can cause reduced sweating (hypohidrosis) and absent sweating (anhidrosis). But a reduction in sweat is usually caused by medications such as antidepressants, illnesses such as diabetes, or autonomic dysfunction and neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s Disease. Most of these cases are also rare, says Nowell Solish, the former president of the Canadian Society of Dermatologic Surgery.</p>
      <p>“If you have surgery or trauma to the nervous system, it can cause areas not to sweat properly. It can happen where you damage a nerve and now you don’t sweat from your arm,” said Solish. </p>

      <p>“If (Prince Andrew) is saying he doesn’t sweat anywhere in his whole body, that’s the central nervous system, that’s from brain damage, and that’s from rare neurological conditions…. If he had a major neurological disease, why wouldn’t he say that? You’d also be able to notice because there are other factors associated with it.”</p>
      <p>Lupin said that if being “shot at” is considered a trigger for shutting down the ability to sweat, then the shot would have had to injure the autonomic nervous system, while causing grave and permanent neurological damage, “which appears not to be the case here.”</p>
      <p>Lupin also mentioned that increased adrenaline is instead associated with increased sweating. And if Prince Andrew is making a point related to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), another state of heightened anxiety and stress, then it’s still more likely that it would lead to an increase in sweat, rather than a decrease.</p>
      <p>Solish explains that there is a small group of people who suffer from idiopathic illnesses, which are spontaneous and their cause is unknown. But he’s never heard of it ever being associated with an adrenaline rush.</p>
      <p>There also are genetic syndromes, such as anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, but that’s present at birth and is not an acquired condition, Lupin said. A disease such as anhidrosis can also be hereditary and, even though <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/11/prince-andrew-says-he-once-didnt-sweat-is-that-possible/602227/">Queen Elizabeth is known for her ability to stay calm and collected in the heat</a>, it hasn’t been reported that it’s a disease she suffers from.</p>
      <p>Solish says that if Prince Andrew did have this condition where he couldn’t sweat, it would be very dangerous for him to be out in hot climates and temperatures because his body wouldn’t be able to properly regulate its core temperature, which could lead to hyperthermia.</p>
      <p>That means it would especially be alarming if Prince Edward were to stay at Epstein’s residence in sunny <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/16/uk/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-bbc-interview/index.html">Palm Beach, which he’s confirmed to have done in the past.</a></p>
      <p>Solish says that it’d be easy to prove someone has an inability to normally sweat. But Prince Andrew’s claim that he’s “done a number of things in the recent past” to allow him to sweat, brings up other perhaps unproven claim, since anhidrosis in itself can’t be cured. </p>
      <p>“I’ve never heard of treatment to make your body sweat more,” said Solish. “I don’t know of anything you can do to make you sweat. Usually, the treatment is figuring out how to control it, how to cool yourself down and stay out of environments that can be dangerous for you.”</p>
