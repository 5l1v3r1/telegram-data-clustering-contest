      <p>Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been charged on allegations of corruption after an investigation found he received lavish gifts from billionaires including James Packer.</p>
      <p>Capping a three-year investigation, Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit charged Mr Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three different scandals.</p>
      <p>It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.</p>

      <p>According to the indictment, Mr Netanyahu accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher and used his influence to help a wealthy telecom magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>The indictment does not require Mr Netanyahu to resign but is expected to raise pressure on him to step down.</p>

      <p>Mr Mandelblit was set to issue a statement later today, as was Mr Netanyahu, who has called the allegations part of a witch hunt, lashing out against the media, police, prosecutors and the justice system.</p>
      <p>The most serious charges were connected to so-called “Case 4000,” in which Netanyahu is accused of passing regulations that gave his friend, telecom magnate Shaul Elovitch, benefits worth over $US250 million ($367 million) to his company Bezeq.</p>
      <p>In return, Bezeq’s news site, <i>Walla</i>, published favourable articles about Mr Netanyahu and his family.</p>

      <p>The relationship, it said, was “based on a mutual understanding that each of them had significant interests that the other side had the ability to advance.”</p>
      <p>It also accused Mr Netanyahu of concealing the relationship by providing “partial and misleading information” about his connections with Mr Elovitch.</p>
      <p>Two close aides to Mr Netanyahu turned state’s witness and testified against him in the case.</p>
      <p>The indictment also said that Mr Netanyahu’s gifts of champagne from billionaires Arnon Milchan and<a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/9e193d11dc4ffb2af24c89b2ae5b3cfd"> James Packer </a>“turned into a sort of supply line.”</p>
      <p>It estimated the value of the gifts at nearly $US200,000 ($A294,000).</p>
      <p>The indictment said Mr Netanyahu assisted the Israeli Milchan, a Hollywood mogul, in extending his US visa.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear what, if anything, Mr Packer received in return.</p>
      <p>Both Mr Milchan and Mr Packer denied any wrongdoing and face no charges.</p>
