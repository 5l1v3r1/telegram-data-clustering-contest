      <h1>A Black Market Baby Yoda Gift Guide</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:46:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author">Jen Chaney</a></address>
      <p>If you visit the official Disney store, you will find some <a href="https://www.shopdisney.com/search?q=the+mandalorian&amp;lang=default">merchandise inspired by the Disney+ series <i>The Mandalorian</i></a>: a few T-shirts, a Mandalorian Funko Pop, a MacBook sleeve featuring an image of the Mandalorian riding a blurrg. But there is not one single piece of merch devoted to the breakout star of <i>The Mandalorian</i> and the most blatantly merch-friendly character in the whole series: Baby Yoda. I emailed a rep for Disney+ and was told there is “nothing to share at this time” regarding potential Baby Yoda products. If I hear differently, this article will be updated.<i> (Update: Since the publication of this article, CNBC has </i><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-apparel-accessories-toys-and-plush-are-coming.html"><i>reported</i></a><i> that there will indeed be official merchandise soon.)</i></p>
      <p>Perhaps Disney decided to keep a lid on Baby Yoda stuff because they wanted to keep all spoilers about America’s New Jedi Sweetheart totally locked down. After all, we still don’t know Baby Yoda’s actual name or identity, and perhaps Disney is holding out on its rollout of products until all that is revealed. Or perhaps the corporate monolith made a colossal error on par with the Not Enough Adequately Cute Porg Merchandise Crisis of 2017. </p>
      <p>In any case, when corporate America leaves a vacuum, other Americans fill it. If you search the internet for Baby Yoda merchandise, you will find plenty of items, especially on Etsy, that are here to serve all your Baby Yoda holiday gift-giving needs, as well as your personal Baby Yoda needs — which, of course, we all have. </p>
      <p>As such, here is our black market Baby Yoda gift guide, featuring 15 of our favorite Baby Yoda items for sale. </p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Baby Yoda Plush Doll, Option 1</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-gift-guide/baby-yoda-gift-guide-16.w570.h570.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Clearly what everyone wants most is a fuzzy little Yoda to call their own. At the moment, the plush Baby Yoda arena is a seller’s market, as there are few available. This one, which takes Baby Yoda to the next level by giving us Swaddled Baby Yoda, is back in stock after selling out once already. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/754124309/baby-yoda-plush"><b><i>$25 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      <h3>Baby Yoda Plush Doll, Option 2</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>There are only five of this option in stock on Etsy as I type, so it may be gone before you can grab it. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/739850274/baby-yoda-inspired-felt-plush?gpla=1&amp;gao=1&amp;&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=shopping_us_b-toys_and_games-toys-stuffed_animals_and_plushies-other&amp;utm_custom1=ab3f7e28-e3b6-4e04-aafd-6d757c4af49f&amp;utm_content=go_1844178614_71423553002_346398451861_pla-314760243326_c__739850274&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oeixxMF2AQizjrM6iEC1f6uv0bHnA-jRS02ZLRBcVvTIS97rEgvvkXoaAkCdEALw_wcB"><b><i>$25 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is a tiny, crochet Baby Yoda that seems kind of expensive at $35? On the other hand, how fun would it be to carry around a li’l Baby Yoda in your pocket?? <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/476648338/baby-yoda-crochet-yoda-star-wars?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda+plush&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-27&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;frs=1"><b><i>$35 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>Speaking of Baby Yoda and pockets, there are a few Baby Yoda pocket tees floating around the internet, including this one, which has a Christmas theme. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/740557516/baby-santa-yoda-pocket-tee"><b><i>$20 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>This shirt, meanwhile, focuses on Baby Yoda’s frog-hunting hobby. <a href="https://www.teepublic.com/t-shirt/6783344-hunting-frogs"><b><i>$13 at Teepublic.</i></b></a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>This T-shirt doesn’t have a pocket, but its celebration of Baby Yoda’s age — like Sally O’Malley from <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, he’s <i>50</i>! 50 years old! — provides extra flair. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/738964206/zerobriant-mw-and-kids-sizes-slayin-50?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sc_gallery-1-3&amp;plkey=9b8e595e53b96ee915b3542239b150c1457227ba%3A738964206&amp;pro=1&amp;col=1"><b><i>$22.35 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      </figure>
      <p>Think only adults can have a fashion-oriented take on Baby Yoda’s age? No! Your own baby can prove they’re the coolest infant in day care with a onesie that provides its own commentary on the most badass 50-year-old in the galaxy. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/738798704/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-baby-bodysuit?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-33&amp;organic_search_click=1&amp;cns=1&amp;col=1"><b><i>$16 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      <p>This T-shirt features the name of an actual <i>Mandalorian</i> episode, one that basically implies that Baby Yoda is the one and only child that matters at this moment in time. And that is true. Well, unless you’re a parent, in which case maybe your child/children matter more to you, personally. But if we’re being honest … you’ve probably thought more about Baby Yoda in the past week than you have about your own offspring. <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/shop/p/42528194.FB110.unisex-tee-w?grid_pos=2&amp;rbs=08768b53-aab3-434e-b8ee-9fcc949c1154&amp;ref=shop_grid&amp;searchTerm=baby%20yoda"><b><i>$17.36 at RedBubble.</i></b></a></p>

      <h3>Baby Yoda Christmas Ornament</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-gift-guide/baby-yoda-gift-guide-07.w570.h712.jpg"/>

      <p>Far be it from me to tell anyone how to celebrate the holidays. That said: If you have a Christmas tree and don’t have a Baby Yoda ornament hanging from it, you should return all the gifts, tell Santa not to bother showing up, then burn the tree to the ground. Fortunately, thanks to this Etsy ornament of Baby Yoda hangin’ out in his levitating crib, none of that will be necessary. Added bonus: You can paint the ornament yourself, which will give the kids something to do during the one hour each day when they aren’t watching Disney+. <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/740487394/christmas-tree-ornament-baby-yoda?show_sold_out_detail=1&amp;frs=1"><b><i>$20 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>

      <h3>Baby Yoda for President Ornament/Magnet</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-gift-guide/baby-yoda-gift-guide-03.w700.h467.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You can also opt for this ornament, which can be turned into a magnet if you prefer. Yes, I know. Baby Yoda is supposed to be the nonpolitical figure we need right now. But there’s no question that if he joined the Democratic race for president, he’d immediately become the front-runner. Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris: I mean, they’re great. But none of them can use the Force. (Well, maybe Warren can.) <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/741097400/baby-yoda-for-president-ornament-or?ga_order=most_relevant&amp;ga_search_type=all&amp;ga_view_type=gallery&amp;ga_search_query=baby+yoda+earrings&amp;ref=sr_gallery-1-3&amp;organic_search_click=1"><b><i>$7.99 at Etsy.</i></b></a></p>
