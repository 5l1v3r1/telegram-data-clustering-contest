      <p>Spurs, alongside Manchester United, were strongly linked with the Portugal international throughout the summer but neither club could come to an agreement with Sporting.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has again been in impressive form for his Portuguese club this season, scoring nine times and contributing six assists in 17 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Independent</i>, Mourinho wants his new club to secure a move for Fernandes when the winter transfer window opens for business at the start of 2020.</p>
      <p>Spurs are preparing to enter a new era with Mourinho swiftly being named the team's new head coach following the sacking of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The capital giants will be looking for just their fourth Premier League win of the campaign when they travel to West Ham United on Saturday afternoon.</p>
