      <h2>Alyx could just be the start</h2>

      <p>Today, Valve finally unveiled <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, its first full-fledged VR game and, more importantly, the developer’s long-awaited return to the <i>Half-Life</i> series. The game will be out in March 2020, and it marks the first new <i>Half-Life</i> title since <i>Episode 2</i> in 2007. And according to Valve, we might not have to wait another decade to see the series continue — but that depends on the success of <i>Alyx</i>.</p>
      <aside>“We’ve had to explore new ways to tell stories with these characters and this world.”</aside>
      <p>“It’s probably no surprise that many people at Valve have been wanting to get back to the <i>Half-Life</i> universe for a long time, and this experience has only reinforced that,” Valve’s David Speyrer tells <i>The Verge</i>. “In the process of creating <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, we’ve had to explore new ways to tell stories with these characters and this world, and we’ve discovered a lot of new gameplay experiences that go beyond what we’ve been able to do before. Of course, we’ll have to wait and see how people react to <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> once it’s out, but we’d love to continue pushing forward.”</p>
      <p>The new VR game is something of a prequel, taking place before the events of <i>Half-Life 2</i>, and Speyrer says that people should play through <i>Episode 2</i> before hopping into the new game. But he also notes that it’s not just a short tech demo or spinoff, as is typical with VR games. “It’s not a side story, nor an episodic one — it’s the next part of the <i>Half-Life</i> story, in a game around the same length as <i>Half-Life 2</i>,” he explains.</p>
