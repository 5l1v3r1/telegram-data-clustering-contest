      <p>Facebook is currently seeking entries for its second Community Action Grants programme in Meath, where its Clonee Data Centre is located, to support local community projects. The Community Action Grants programme is implemented in every community in which Facebook has developed a data centre and this is the second year the company will be inviting grant applications for projects in Meath. </p>
      <p>The scheme will be inviting applications that address community needs by putting the power of technology to use for community benefit, improving local STEM education or connecting people on or offline. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, 15 organisations benefitted from the Facebook Community Action Grants programme. As a result, communities were able to buy much needed equipment such as whiteboards, computers, projectors tablets and lab tools. This enabled schools to focus on STEM, older people were able to update their digital skills and youth groups availed of the chance to update their ICT skills and systems.</p>
      <p>Clonee Data Centre Site Manager, Aoife Flynn said:  “At Facebook, we are committed to playing a positive role and investing in the long-term vitality of the local community here in Meath. We’re delighted to be opening our annual Community Action Grants program for the second year. Last year we were honoured to support the work of multiple local schools in STEM, robotics and creative coding, local community centres through technology upgrades, and community groups of all ages from Youth Reach to Third Age. We’re very excited to see what applications come forward from local community groups in Meath this year.”</p>
      <p>Facebook’s Clonee Data Centre, which became operational in September 2018, is part of the highly-advanced infrastructure that helps bring Facebook apps and services to over 2 billion people every day. </p>
      <p>The Clonee Data Centre is supported by 100% renewable wind energy and is one of the most advanced and energy-efficient data centres in the world. Facebook worked with Brookfield Renewables to tap into their wind energy assets in Ireland, to not only power the data centre but also the international headquarters in Dublin. Facebook recently announced that in 2020, the company’s global operations will be supported by 100% renewable energy. </p>
      <p>In 2019 Facebook awarded community grants worth over €150,000 to fifteen organisations in Meath. Funding was granted to a range of community organisations and schools to support their work connecting people both on and off line and improving STEM education. Granted projects included major ICT upgrades in the classrooms of Meath schools, digital access and integration projects for teens in direct provision, robotics and digital equipment for community groups including Coder Dojo, the Enfield Fairy Trail and the Dunboyne Community Centre. </p>
      <p>Facebook has been very involved in the local community in Meath since opening in late 2018. Working with Prosper Meath, a charity of adults with intellectual disabilities, they supported the build of a new Sensory Community Garden in Trim which was opened in May 2019 and won the Community Age Friendly Initiative award in September of this year. Facebook is committed to creating opportunities for the community in Meath and recently partnered with Code Dojo to present two local 'train the trainer' workshops for community organisations and schools. </p>
      <p> For further details on the criteria and how to apply, please visit the Clonee Data Center Facebook Page. The closing date is 3rd December.</p>
