      <p>Bad news for transparency and for foes of Trump.</p>
      <p>Attempts by California lawmakers to force Donald Trump to release his tax returns before he can qualify to run for re-election in 2010 ended today. The California Supreme Court on Thursday ruled unanimously that the Democrat-sponsored legislation violates a state constitutional requirement to include all “recognized” presidential candidates on the primary ballot.</p>

      <blockquote>The state law, the first of its kind in the nation, “is in conflict with the Constitution’s specification of an inclusive open presidential primary ballot,” said Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye. The ruling came just 15 days after the court heard arguments in the case.<br/><br/>Trump is the first president in more than four decades to refuse to disclose his income tax returns. A federal judge in Sacramento blocked enforcement of the California law last month, in suits by Trump and other Republicans, saying the law probably violated thee rights of voters as well as candidates and conflicted with a less-demanding federal financial-disclosure law.</blockquote>
      <p>No appeal is likely.</p>
