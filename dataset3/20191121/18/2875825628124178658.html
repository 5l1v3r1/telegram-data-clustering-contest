      <h1>Serial winner Jose Mourinho promises to build something special at Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho's opening press conference contained messages for his new squad at Tottenham and reflections on the one he left behind at Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:47:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:47</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>His charm offensive over, it is now down to business for Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>His opening press conference contained messages for his new squad at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and reflections on the one he left behind at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>There is still a top four place, an FA Cup and a Champions League knockout place up for grabs. Mourinho is energised to target them all. What he wants from his squad is the work ethic of an NBA superstar.</p>
      <p>“I read one quote from Kobe Bryant,” he said. “And if you have to speak about some examples of professionalism and serial winners, Kobe is a great example. He says: 'People say that I'm difficult but I'm only difficult for the ones that don't share my principles.'</p>

      <p>“So all the colleagues that share his principles, they just love him. The ones that don't like him are the ones that don't share the principles.</p>
      <p>“With me it's basically the same. For me everything is about the team, it's not about selfish people. For me, everything is about the group and professionalism and commitment and respect for the club, respect for the mates, respect for the fans.</p>
      <p>“I cannot run away from this so if there is somebody that doesn't share these principles with me, then we have a problem and we will always have a problem because this is the way I think football has to be.</p>
      <p>“The players are only big when they make the others better. You cannot be a big player if you just think about yourself.</p>
      <p>“That's another principle. To be a big player, you have to make others big. If I have players that think they are big and they just care about themselves, and forget to help others to be big, we are always going to have a problem.”</p>

      <p>The likes of influential Harry Kane will have no issue with all that. It might just touch a nerve, however, with a number of players at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>In case there was any doubt, Mourinho added: "Sometimes you have to work with people you don't love and work well. I have principles that I cannot change and one of those is that I don't think I can change."</p>
      <p>That said, the Portuguese was adamant that the past year out - since being sacked by United last December - had given him time to look at himself and analyse where he’d gone wrong.</p>
      <p>“These 11 months were months to think, to analyse, to prepare and anticipate things,” he said. “I think you never lose your DNA, you never lose your identity, what you are.</p>
      <p>“Don't ask me what are the mistakes but I realise that during my career I made mistakes. I’m not going to make the same mistakes, I’m going to make new mistakes.</p>

      <p>“I’ve had time. I think I am stronger. When I say I'm stronger I'm not saying I'm fitter, I've always been fit, but I think I'm stronger. From an emotional point of view I'm relaxed, I'm motivated, I'm ready and I think the Spurs players they’ve felt that in these two days.”</p>
      <p>Addressing a packed Spurs press conference at their Enfield HQ, Mourinho was adamant that he won’t need to dip into the January transfer market and that the squad he has is already the Christmas present he could have hoped for.</p>
      <p>”Its the best gift for me, I don't need players," he said. "I am happy with the ones I have. I just need more time with them. I know them well from playing against them, but you never know them well enough.”</p>
      <p>He has put them on notice, however, that he does not do glorious failure.</p>
      <p>"When I don't win I cannot be happy and I cannot change that," Mourinho added. "That is my DNA.</p>
      <p>"I hope I can influence my players, because if you are happy losing football matches it is very hard to be a winner.”</p>
