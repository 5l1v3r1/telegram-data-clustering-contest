      <p>One post he shared said: "I get told on a daily how much I'm punching... trust me I know... so proud of you and can’t wait to have you back home".</p>
      <p>And another one gushed: "She's gone back to Hong Kong but had the most amazing birthday weekend with my girl I love you and thank you for all the presents xxx".</p>
      <p>As if the trips away aren't enough, Roman and Anne-Sophie also attend the BAFTAs and film premieres across the city, as well as fun nights out together.</p>

      <p>Revealing a different side to the Capital presenter, his partner explained how romantic Roman went to great lengths to ensure she won't be forgotten about while he's in Australia.</p>
      <p>"He's left me a two minute video for every day that he can't speak to me," Anne-Sophie revealed. "I'll get to watch one of them every morning.</p>
      <p>"He filmed them before he left and put them on a USB stick so I'll have to try and keep it to just one a day," she added.</p>
