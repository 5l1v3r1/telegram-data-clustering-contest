      <p>Netanyahu told the families that he is committed to bringing back the soldiers and civilians being held by Hamas. He updated the families on the latest developments and the open and covert efforts being carried out by the Israeli government to return their sons.</p>
      <p>National Security Council Chairman Meir Ben-Shabbat, the Prime Minister’s Military Secretary Brig.-Gen. Avi Bluth and a Foreign Ministry representative also attended the meeting.</p>
