      <h1>Glitch delays British Airways flights amid looming 27-day rail strike</h1>

      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Technical issues prompted British Airways to cancel or delay dozens of international flights headed for London, officials said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The carrier said <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/british-airways-flight-delays-ba-heathrow-gatwick-a9211646.html">unexplained technical issues</a> interfered with flights from numerous locations, including the United States and the Caribbean, and kept them from landing at London's Heathrow and Gatwick airports.</p>
      <p>"Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue ... and we have rebooked customers onto alternative flights and offered hotel accommodation," the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/british-airways-flights-disrupted-by-technical-issue-11866078">airline said</a>. "We are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans."</p>
      <p>Some flights from the Caribbean and Mexico to Gatwick faced delays as long as 22 hours. Other travelers from Barbados, Antigua, Bermuda and New York City also saw hours-long delays.</p>
      <p>An official at Gatwick <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50500760">told BBC News</a> the problem was in the airline's flight planning system.</p>
      <p>Trouble with Britain's national carrier wasn't the only transportation-related issue Thursday. The Rail, Maritime and Transport union authorized a 27-day labor strike against South Western Railway next month after negotiations broke down. At issue are details about the presence of guards on trains.</p>
      <p>"Throughout these â€Žtalks, [South Western Railway] has not shown any intention of moving the issues at the heart of the dispute forwards despite verbal assurances in earlier discussions," RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said <a href="https://www.rmt.org.uk/news/rmt-action-on-south-western-railway-goes-ahead/">in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>"As a result of the [SWR] attitude all planned action remains on and the union is committed to ensuring the safest possible method of operation."</p>
      <p>SWR Managing Director Andy Mellors promised there will continue to be guards on all trains.</p>
      <p>"We believe that these promises deliver what the RMT has been asking for, so these strikes are unnecessary."</p>
      <p>The strikes are set for three stints -- from Dec. 2-11, from Dec. 13-24 and from Dec. 27-Jan. 1.</p>
