        <b>Al Pacino is taking on the bad guys and fighting literal Nazi’s in the intense first look at new series, Hunters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hunters, which will air on Amazon Prime Video in the new year, will see Pacino in 1977, recruiting a ragtag team of Nazi Hunters in New York City.</p>
      <p>Discovering that hundreds of high-ranking officials of the Nazi Party have made their way into the city, the team set out to stop them from bringing about a new genocide.</p>
      <p>As the enemy prepares to create a Fourth Reich, and set out to continue their bloody quest set in place back in World War II, Pacino’s Mayer Offerman collects a group of individuals to help bring them to justice.</p>
      <p>Speaking in the trailer, which cuts through the different lives of the New York City residents, we see how prejudice lies hidden in plain sight as Al warns the others of what’s to come.</p>

      <p>‘There comes a time where we all must choose between the light and the darkness,’ he said. ‘But when there is great darkness in this world, perhaps the choice is made for us.’</p>
      <p>‘You know, for aeons, people like us have been degraded and exterminated. But no more,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>Warning that evil is not natural, but grows from the bottom, he tells the hidden faces: ‘It becomes a scourge and we can’t know such evil until it strikes.</p>

      <p>‘So the time to act is now, before everything that’s dear to us is destroyed. This is not murder, this is mitzvah.’</p>
      <p>Who does he find? Well to start off a clueless looking Jonah Heidelbaum (Logan Lerman,Perks Of Being A Wallflower) who takes centre stage among his fellow hunters.</p>
      <p>Then there’s Lonny Flash (Josh Radnor, How I Met Your Mother), who has managed to lean into the 70s vibe with a leather jacket, garish shirt and one of the most glorious tash’s we’ve ever seen on screen.</p>

      <p>In real life we’d love them in our corner, but in character on this show? They’re definitely not high on our list on who to go to in the midst of a force.</p>
      <p>Get Out creator Jordan Peele has helped bring the new series to life, acting as executive producer on the perfectly twisted tale.</p>
      <p>Sign. Us. Up. We’re completely sold.</p>
