      <h2>Children's author David Walliams has bagged himself a nine-figure cash injection after becoming one of the top-earning British authors</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:07:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:07</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Bryant, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/tom-bryant/</a></address>
      <p>David Walliams has joined Harry Potter writer JK Rowling in the £100million league of top-earning British children’s authors.</p>
      <p>The Britain’s Got Talent judge has made the nine-figure sum in 11 years since his first book The Boy In the Dress was published in 2008, claimed the Bookseller trade magazine.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old comedian, whose latest book The Beast of Buckingham Palace was published yesterday, is estimated to have made more than £17million last year alone.</p>
      <p>His bestseller is Gangsta Granny, which spent 21 consecutive weeks as the children’s No1 in 2013 and has sold 1.35 million copies in paperback alone. Others include 2016 hit The Midnight Gang, 2017’s Bad Dad, and last year’s The Ice Monster.</p>
