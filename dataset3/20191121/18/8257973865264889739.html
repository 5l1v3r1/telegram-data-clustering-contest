      <h1>Lockheed contracts for two solid state radar SPY-7 sets for Aegis Ashore Japan</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:46:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author">Christen McCurdy</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Lockheed Martin announced Wednesday that it has contracted with the Japanese Ministry of Defense to produce two solid state radar antenna sets for Aegis Ashore Japan.</p>
      <p>The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System is a U.S. program designed to provide missile defense against short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles.</p>
      <p>The system is designed to detect, track and engage ballistic missile threats and engage multiple targets simultaneously. The Aegis system was recently designated by the federal government as AN/SPY-7(V)1, and provides several times the detection range and sensitivity of previous Aegis systems.</p>
      <p>Japan decided to deploy its own Aegis missile defense system in June 2017 and <a href="https://www.upi.com/Defense-News/2019/01/30/Japan-approved-for-215B-buy-of-Aegis-Ashore-missile-defense-systems/7771548858507/">spent $2.15 billion</a> to purchase two Aegis systems at the beginning of this year.</p>
      <p>Japan's defense minister, Takeshi Iwaya, has argued Japan needs Aegis Ashore for national security. But the program has been controversial.</p>
      <p>In June, Japan's defense minister admitted the government's decision to deploy the missile defense program, and its chosen locations, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/06/06/Flaws-in-data-for-Aegis-Ashore-deployment-rile-Japans-politicians/1891559837436/">had been based on faulty data</a>.</p>
      <p>Japanese lawmakers and residents of the Akita prefecture, where the interceptors are set to be deployed, <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2018/06/14/Plans-for-Aegis-Ashore-met-with-opposition-in-Japan/4931528991639/">have also expressed concerns</a> about the effects of the program's radar on the health of the city's 330,000 residents.</p>
      <p>Variants of the SPY-7 radar will also be utilized through partnerships with the U.S. Government, Spain and Canada. To date, the technology has been selected for a total of 24 systems.</p>
