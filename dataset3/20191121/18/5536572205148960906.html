      <h1>BREAKING: Myles Garrett Claims Mason Rudolph Called Him A Racial Slur Before TNF Brawl</h1>

      <p>When Myles Garrett ripped off Mason Rudolph’s helmet and smashed him over the head with it, many called for the Cleveland Browns’ star pass rusher to be to be handed a lengthy suspension. And he was.</p>
      <p>The NFL hit Garrett with an indefinite suspension that will last for at least the remainder of the 2019 season and playoffs, and possibly even longer. Garrett visited with the NFL on Wednesday to appeal their decision, and during his appeal, an interesting tidbit of information regarding what led to the brawl was revealed.</p>
      <p>According to Garrett, Rudolph had previously called him a racial slur.</p>
      <p>Here’s the report from Adam Schefter:</p>

      <p>If this is true, it would explain why Garrett was hellbent on smashing Rudolph’s head open. As for whether or not this will help Myles get his suspension reduced, we should find that out soon enough.</p>
