      <p>The Gallagher Premiership leaders maintained their strong domestic form by flattening Zebre 59-21 in their Pool Four opener but Brive are more dangerous opponents than the underpowered Italians.</p>
      <p>"It's a massive game because with all teams fighting on both sides, us getting a win over there would be huge for our ambition," director of rugby <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pat-lam/"><b>Pat Lam</b></a> said.</p>
      <p>"Not only do we want to win our group but also get a home quarter-final and a home semi-final.</p>
      <p>"I've made no secret of the fact that I wasn't happy with how we played against Zebre, but I've been so pleased with the training we've had since.</p>
      <p>"It's been superb and guys have been on the money as far as attitude goes."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/steven-luatua/"><b>Steven Luatua</b></a> recovers from a hip injury to lead Bristol, while the return of former England lock <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dave-attwood/"><b>Dave Attwood</b></a> is also one of eight changes made for the trip to Stade Amedee-Domenech.</p>
