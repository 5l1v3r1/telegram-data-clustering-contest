      <p>He might look cuddly but this nine-week-old Belgian Malinois puppy is the newest weapon in crime-fighting for WA Police.</p>
      <p>If he makes the cut, Joker will be one of WA Police’s unique dual-trained police dogs — able to track and catch offenders and detect drugs.</p>
      <p>“Other police forces around Australia are looking at our program here, some of them quite enviously, and they’re seeing the benefits of dual-trained dogs,” Police Minister Michelle Roberts said.</p>

      <p>Seven-year-old PD Whiskey will be the first dual-trained dog to help to fight crime when he is deployed in Kalgoorlie with his handler, First Class Constable Barry McDonald later this year.</p>
      <p>“You need a really close bond, but he also needs to know that I’m in charge,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We work in dangerous environments so I need to know that he’s got my back and I’ve got his.”</p>
