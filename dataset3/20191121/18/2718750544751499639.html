      <h1>Pete Davidson Says He Masturbated to Leonardo DiCaprio’s, Uh, Acting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:18:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Haylock</a></address>
      <p>“I’m not attracted to them, I just think they’re talented” is a slippery slope and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/01/pete-davidson-returns-to-stand-up-after-suicide-scare.html">Pete Davidson</a> is its latest victim. The comedian happily got personal with <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/05/13-reasons-why-netflix-tattoos.html"><i>13 Reasons Why</i>’s Tommy Dorfman</a> for <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-pete-davidson-2641400317.html?rebelltitem=27#rebelltitem27"><i>Paper </i>magazine</a>, revealing his No. 1 celebrity crush when he was younger: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/leonardo-dicaprio-movies-ranked.html">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. Davidson totally gets why his own fans find him attractive, because he’s been that kind of fan, too. “Well, I used to jerk off to Leonardo DiCaprio …” he said, before backtracking. “Uhh, like, his acting.” Mm-hmm. Acting. Continue.</p>
      <p>“I used to have a <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/01/when-leonardo-dicaprio-went-from-twink-to-twunk.html">HUGE crush on Leonardo DiCaprio</a>,” the <i>SNL</i> cast member went on. “I had this huge poster of him from <i>The Beach </i>in my room, and there used to be, like, ‘Leo love books’ … Do you remember? Like, right when <i>Titanic </i>came out [when I was] in like third or fourth grade, he was just like, ‘teen milk.’ There were love books and I had all of them. He was the coolest.”</p>
      <p>No one can blame Davidson for having a crush on literally the most crushable heartthrob of all time. But we can blame him for the fact that his current love interest, Kaia Gerber, wasn’t born until a year after <i>The Beach </i>came out. Guess Pete Davidson really was inspired by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/leonardo-dicaprio-likes-euphoria-with-zendaya-jacob-elordi.html">DiCaprio</a>.</p>
