      <h1>New research shows one-third of South Korea pollutants come from China</h1>

      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- South Korean climate experts said Thursday ultrafine dust from China has declined, a day after a joint research report on long-range transport pollution was released in Seoul.</p>
      <p>According to the report that includes Chinese, Japanese and South Korean research, ultrafine dust known to cause respiratory problems persists in three major Korean cities: Seoul, Daejeon and Busan, Yonhap reported.</p>
      <p>The study said 51 percent of pollutants originated from within Korea, 32 percent from China and the remaining 2 percent from Japan, with the rest originating from <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/North_Korea/?tps=1">North Korea</a>, Mongolia and Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>Kim Soon-tae, a professor of environment and safety engineering at Ajou University, said Thursday at a Seoul climate conference Chinese pollutants have declined since 2013, when the world's second-largest economy began tackling fine dust.</p>
      <p>Within China, fine dust emissions declined by 50 percent since 2013. Chinese-origin pollutants fell by 30 percent in South Korea, Kim said, referring to simulation tests he conducted as part of his research.</p>
      <p>Fine dust pollution resulting from local power plants and pollutants floating from China have been described as a disaster in Seoul; on Thursday Kim said South Korea must do more to tackle domestic pollutants.</p>
      <p>The joint report on transnational pollution is under scrutiny by other analysts, however.</p>
      <p>Jang Jae-yeon, a professor of preventive medicine at Ajou University who studies environmental pollution, said there may have been a "political compromise" between the South Korean and Chinese governments in arriving at the exact percentages stated in the joint summary, local news network MBC reported Thursday.</p>
      <p>China and South Korea have been in environment-related negotiations, during which Beijing may have agreed to acknowledge at least 32 percent of ultrafine dust originated from China, Jang said.</p>
      <p>Jang also said there were differences among the Chinese, Japanese and Korean findings about pollution origins, according to MBC.</p>
