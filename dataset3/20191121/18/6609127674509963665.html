        <b>A JAILED fiend who raped a woman and preyed on three others during years of horrific sexual abuse has been sentenced to a further six years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gerard Porteous, 59, carried out a sickening domestic abuse campaign on one woman including rape and indecent assault between 1987 and 1993.</p>

      <p>He was convicted on Monday October 1 over the repeated abuse at a house in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>And Porteous, who is already serving 12 years for sex attacks on three other women, had his jail term extended by six years today with an order of lifelong restriction.</p>
      <p>In May 2016, Porteous was caged for sexual offences relating three women in the Airdrie and Paisley areas between 1994 and 2013.</p>
      <p>It followed an investigation by Police Scotland’s Domestic Abuse Task Force in 2014.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Iain Renfrew said: “Gerard Porteous carried out a six year campaign of abuse towards his partner and attacked another woman, which will have no doubt left them deeply affected by the experience for the rest of their lives.</p>
      <p>"I must thank these women for having the strength to come forward and report the abuse they endured, and for the courage they have shown throughout the investigation.</p>
      <p>"I hope today’s outcome gives them some sort of closure and sends a clear message to anyone who thinks it is acceptable to treat people in this way.</p>
      <p>"Gerard Porteous is a serial domestic abuser whose offending behaviour spans 32 years.</p>
      <p>“He must now face the consequences of his horrendous behaviour for the rest of his life.</p>
      <p>"Police Scotland is committed to tackling domestic abuse and no one should ever feel they are alone or in a position of fear.</p>
      <p>"I would encourage anyone to report domestic abuse in any form, as all reports will be thoroughly investigated. We will continue to work with partner agencies to ensure victims of domestic abuse are supported and to ensure their safety and wellbeing."</p>
