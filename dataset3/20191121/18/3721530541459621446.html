      <p><i>Final Fantasy</i><i> 14 </i>producer Naoki Yoshida apparently wants to bring the online role-playing game to PlayStation 5, according to a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/FFUKFans/status/1197254733716770821">a Final Fantasy fan twitter account</a>, but it doesn’t appear to be a done deal just yet.</p>
      <p>Yoshida spoke at the <i>Final Fantasy 14</i> Fan Gathering in London, where he reportedly said that the game is in development for PS5. This isn’t particularly shocking news, as <i>Final Fantasy 14</i> made the transition from PlayStation 3 in 2013 to PlayStation 4 the following year.</p>
      <p>When Polygon reached out to Square Enix for details, a PR representative said, “While not a confirmation, Yoshida-san expressed a hope that <i>Final Fantasy XIV Online</i> may one day appear on the next generation of Sony console.”</p>
      <p>This does potentially mean that PS4 support will end one day for <i>Final Fantasy 14</i>, in the same way support ended for the PS3 version of the MMO. PS3 support for<i> Final Fantasy 14 </i>ended in June 2017, alongside with the release of the <i>Stormblood </i>expansion, several years after the game released for PS4. That being said, PS4 support will likely not be ending any time soon.</p>
      <p>For anyone playing on PS4, don’t fret. Last time Square Enix stopped supporting a console, the company <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e9fbafe97c1042d749b57ca57cfd8ee1cc02518c">provided a free upgrade</a> for anyone with the old license. (Though you still needed the new console to play the game.)</p>
