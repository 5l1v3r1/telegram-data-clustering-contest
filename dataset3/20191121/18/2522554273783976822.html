      <h1>Kodak Black Files Appeal for Nearly Four-Year Prison Sentence</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:05:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xxlmag.com/author/marisamendez/" target="_blank">Marisa Mendez</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/tags/kodak-black/">Kodak Black</a> is looking to fight his sentencing. On Thursday (Nov. 21), <i>XXL</i> obtained documents that indicate Kodak's lawyer has appealed the rapper's <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/kodak-black-prison-sentence-gun-charges/">46-month federal gun charges sentence</a>, which was handed down to him on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>"Notice is hereby given that the Defendant, Bill K. Kapri, takes and enters this, his Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to review the Orders, Judgment and Sentence entered on November 13, 2019," the document reads.</p>
      <p>The news comes days after <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/kodak-black-rehab-prison-sentence/">Kodak's legal team filed documents</a> asking Assistant United States Attorney Bruce Brown to recommend that Kodak get placed in a location that has a Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP). If approved, Kodak would spend a portion of his sentence in rehab.</p>
      <p>As previously reported, Kodak's 46-month sentence for his federal gun charges will end up being just around three years with time served. However, he may be looking at additional time. On Nov. 15, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/kodak-black-prison-sentence-new-gun-charges-30-years/">Kodak was handed two new felony counts</a> of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and he's now facing up to 30 years in prison on each count. It's not clear whether the sentences would run concurrently or consecutively.</p>
      <p>In related news, <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/11/kodak-black-college-degree-prison/">Kodak is looking to earn a college degree</a> while behind bars. According to a recent report, the "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Calling-Spirit-Explicit-Kodak-Black/dp/B07KWFX2ZC?SubscriptionId=AKIAJYPOGEBYCEUS42SQ&amp;tag=xxlmagtsm-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953&amp;creativeASIN=B07KWFX2ZC">Calling My Spirit</a>" rapper wants to take business and marketing classes and plans to register for courses at Miami's Federal Detention Center in the near future.</p>
      <p><i>XXL</i> has reached out to Kodak Black's lawyer for comment.</p>
