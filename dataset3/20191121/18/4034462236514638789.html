      <h1>Hyundai Grandeur Is The Flagship Sedan We Can't Have</h1>
      <h2>The Sonata's wacky looks have found their way to a more luxurious sedan.</h2>

      <p>Hyundai <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/say-goodbye-to-the-hyundai-azera-and-veloster">killed off its full-size sedan</a>, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/azera">Azera</a>, back in 2017. Kia has continued to sell its version of the Azera, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/cadenza">Cadenza</a>, but Hyundai has given no indication that it would bring back the Azera for the US market. In other markets, the Azera continues to be sold under the name Grandeur and Hyundai even<a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hyundai-azera-gets-dramatic-new-look"> teased an all-new model</a> with styling that is clearly influenced by the current <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/hyundai/sonata">Sonata</a>. The all-new Grandeur has just been revealed in Korea as Hyundai's new flagship sedan and we are in love with the design.</p>

      <p>The exterior design is radically different from the last Azera and loosely follows the same design philosophy as the new Sonata. It features a unique grille design with an eye-catching diamond pattern and sharp, triangular headlights. At the back, a connected LED light strip gives off a sporty vibe.</p>
      <p>Inside, the interior is all-new and would not look out of place in a Lexus product. The steering wheel is the same unit found on the new Sonata and the large 12.3-inch touchscreen display looks similar as well. Hyundai has included the same push-button shifter found in the Sonata as well as the digital gauge cluster with clever cameras that activate with the turn signals.</p>

      <p>The model seen in the photos sports a luxurious beige leather interior with a two-tone tan color on the dashboard and steering wheel. The interior also features a 64-color ambient light system to create a more elegant atmosphere in the cabin. Hyundai will offer two trims levels called Premium and Exclusive, the latter of which will include premium options such as a leather-enclosed dashboard, calligraphic trim, quilted Nappa leather, and rear suede neck pillows.</p>
      <p>Three engine options will be available including a 2.5-liter, 3.3-liter, and hybrid but sadly, Hyundai has no plans to offer it in the US.</p>
