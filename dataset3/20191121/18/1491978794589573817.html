      <p>The home secretary, Priti Patel, has said the government is not responsible for poverty in the UK. She said: 'It’s all parts of society and the structures', pointing toward local authorities and education services. During a campaign visit to Barrow-in-Furness, in Cumbria, Patel was questioned about how two in five children in some local areas were born into poverty and said: 'It’s not just people in Westminster – it’s not just at a national level, it’s at a local level'.</p>
