      <p>Maria Dickinson, the chairperson of the An Post Irish Book Awards, <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/news/oconnor-phelan-and-corr-triumph-post-irish-book-awards-1116676">said</a>: “Every year the competition seems to get fiercer, and the bar raised even higher – and this year is no exception, as the quality of the award winners demonstrates. From fiction to non-fiction, poetry to Irish language writing, the winning titles reflect the varied and diverse reading tastes of the Irish public.</p>
      <p>“Many of our winning authors reflect on contemporary or historical issues within Irish society, while others amuse, inspire and enthrall through fantastic story-telling. Both the winning authors and all our shortlisted titles are a terrific testament to the strength and vitality of Irish writing – and long may this continue.”</p>
