      <hr/>
      <p>(ORIGINAL UPDATE Nov 20, 2019): After a 15-year wait, dedicated fans of the legendary <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/half-life"><i>Half-Life</i></a> franchise are finally getting a new installment — titled <i><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> —</i> from the American video game developer <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/valve">Valve</a>.</p>
      <p>The news was first announced by the company on November 19, the anniversary of the release date for the original <i>Half-Life. </i>Unlike what most fans expected, however, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2017/8/half-life-episode-3-reveal">instead of the third game</a> in continuation of the original <i>Half-Life</i> series, the upcoming title will be Valve’s flagship virtual reality game, confirming previous rumors based on leaked transcripts. As of now, there’s not much information about the game aside from its being a VR game, and that it will obviously be on Steam, but if previous rumors hold true, <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be slated for release some time in March 2020.</p>
      <p>For more information about the upcoming game, Valve will be unveiling it on Thursday, November 21 at 10:00 AM Pacific Time, so fans of the franchise should definitely tune in.</p>
