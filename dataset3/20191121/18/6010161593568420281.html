      <h1>Here’s your first look at Half-Life: Alyx, Valve’s virtual reality title</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:05:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:05</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>Valve has released our first look at Half-Life: Alyx, its virtual reality title. It’s coming in March 2020.</p>
      <p>Set between the events of Half-Life and Half-Life 2,<b> Half-Life: Alyx</b> is <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/alyx/">a new full-length game</a> built from the ground up by Valve.</p>
      <p>In it, Alyx Vance and her father Eli “mount an early resistance to the Combine’s brutal occupation of Earth.”</p>
      <p>As Alyx, you will engage in combat, solve puzzles, and explore a world turned derelict thanks to an alien invasion.</p>
      <p>According to Valve, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975423/half-life-alyx-vr-price-release-date-screenshots-trailer-valve-steam">speaking with The Verge</a>, it will be the same length as Half-Life 2, and while it takes place before the game, the studio recommends you play through Half-Life 2: Episode 2 before playing the VR title. The reason will “will become clear” as you progress in Alyx.</p>
      <p>Check out the trailer.</p>

      <p>The game is powered by SteamVR on Valve’s Source 2 engine and can be played on Steam with all PC-based VR headsets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/">You can pre-purchase it now for $59.99</a>, but it’s free for owners of the Valve Index VR headset. If you drop the cash early, you can save 10% up until launch.</p>
      <p>It will also feature extra content for those who have purchased Valve Index by the end of 2019 by handing you the following bonuses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Explore environments from Half-Life: Alyx in your SteamVR Home space</li>
        <li>Alternate gun skins to embellish Alyx’s arsenal</li>
        <li>Special Half-Life: Alyx-themed content for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Dota 2</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A set of Source 2 tools for building new environments will also ship with the game, which will allow you to build and contribute new content for the community.</p>
