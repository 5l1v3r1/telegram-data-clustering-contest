      <h1>‘Shatta Wale Has Not Been Nominated For Grammys’- Blogger Clarifies</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:50:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/ghbase2/" target="_blank">Ghbase New Writer</a></address>
      <p>Contrary to the belief and excitement permeating within the corridors of Shatta Movement following the nomination of Beyonce’s Lion King: The Gift album for 2020 Grammys which technically meant Wale has also been nominated, a new report being propagated by a popular blogger NYDJ says otherwise.</p>
      <p>According to the blogger who also doubles as a radio presenter at YFM, he personally sent an email to the organisers for clarification on the Shatta Wale Grammys brouhaha and reply was sent to him to that effect.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“According to a mail received from the Grammy Awards, only Artists who have worked on over 51% playing time of the pop vocal album would be nominees.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Any featured artist with less than 51% would not be a nominee. That settles it. Shatta Wale is not a Grammy Nominee.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>See below;</p>

      <p>It’s must be noted that this is not an official statement from the board members of the Grammy Awards, just a so-called email received by an individual.</p>
      <p>Until we hear something concrete from the board, we can only regard this statement as hearsay.</p>
      <p>In a related development, UK-based <b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/why-do-ghanaians-hate-supporting-their-own-fuse-odg-quizzes-those-discrediting-shatta-wales-grammy-nomination-video/">Ghanaian Afrobeats star, Fuse ODG</a></b> has expressed his dismay at the blogger and other Ghanaians doing everything possible to discredit Shatta Wale and other artists instead of supporting them in relation to the 2020 Grammy Awards.</p>
