      <p>Nkawie (Ash), Nov 21, GNA - Three small scale miners, who conspired to ambush and rob a colleague of his valuables including 15 pounds worth of gold and GHÂ¢500.00 cash, have been remanded into prison custody by the Nkawie Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Kwadwo Mensah, 34, George Oduro, 17, and Abraham Ampofo, 19, the accused persons, were said to have waylaid Amstrong Abugri, a colleague small-scale miner and pulled a gun on him taking away the booty, as he was driving home in his car with registration number DV2432-19.</p>
      <p>This took place at about 20:00 hours on November 17 this year, at Nkonten near Nkawie in the Atwima Nwabiagya Municipality.</p>
      <p>Their pleas were not taken and would come back to the Court presided over by Mr Michael Johnson Abbey, on December 2, this year.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting, Detective Inspector Anthony Acheampong told the Court that the complainant Abugri and the accused were small scale miners at Nkonteng.</p>
      <p>The accused persons who had ambushed the complainant, emerged from the bush when he reached a section on the road on his way home and one of them (Mensah), pulled a single-barrel gun they wielded on him, ordering him to stop, the Court heard.</p>
      <p>Sensing danger, complainant sped away, but Mensah fired a gunshot and complainant losing control of the steering wheel, run into a ditch in the process.</p>
      <p>Complainant however managed to escape from the car and fled the scene, leaving the car behind.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Acheampong said, complainant later returned to take his car and realized that the items had been taken away by the accused persons.</p>
      <p>Complainant made a report to the Nkawie police and after Mensah was arrested, he led the police to arrest the other accomplices.</p>
      <p>After police preliminary investigations, they were charged and arraigned.</p>
