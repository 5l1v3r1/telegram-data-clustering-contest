      <p>As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/18/20970733/half-life-alyx-vr-release-date-valve-announcement">promised</a>, Valve officially unveiled a new Half-Life game on Thursday: <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, a full-length game designed for virtual reality. Set between the events of <i>Half-Life</i> and <i>Half-Life 2</i>, the VR exclusive will tell the story of Alyx Vance and her father Eli as they form a resistance to take on the invasion of the alien force known as the Combine.</p>
      <p>In other words, <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will not move the Half-Life story forward after <i>Episode Two</i>, but will fill a gap in the story during which protagonist Gordon Freeman was in stasis.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> will be released March 2020 on Steam. The game is powered by Valve’s SteamVR software and is compatible with all PC-based VR headsets, including Valve Index, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality. <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> is priced at $59.99, but will be free for owners of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/6/28/18758877/valve-index-review-steam-vr-headset-virtual-reality-pc">Valve’s Index VR headset</a>.</p>
      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> was “designed from the ground up” for VR, Valve said in an announcement, “and features all of the hallmarks of a classic Half-Life game: world exploration, puzzle solving, visceral combat, and an intricately woven story that connects it all with the characters iconic to the Half-Life universe.”</p>
      <p>Images released for <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> show off environments that will be familiar to anyone who has played <i>Half-Life 2</i>. Alyx will explore the dilapidated Eastern European city known as City 17, which has been overtaken by Combine forces. Environments shown by Valve include rundown City 17 apartment blocks, Combine-infested sewers, and the makeshift labs of resistance allies.</p>
      <p>Alyx herself will also sport some <i>Half-Life 2</i>-inspired weaponry in the form of Gravity Gloves. In screenshots, the gloves appear to be both a tool for battle — a la Gordon Freeman’s iconic Gravity Gun — and a helpful bit of user interface.</p>
