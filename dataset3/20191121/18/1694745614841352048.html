      <p>One serving of pure, swoon-worthy content, comin' right up! Jason Momoa stopped by <b>The Kelly Clarkson Show</b> on Wednesday and was unexpectedly grilled by the talk-show host's kids about all things <b>Aquaman</b>, making for quite the adorable segment. <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/kelly-clarkson-kids-46682928">Kelly's 5-year-old daughter River and 3-year-old son Remy</a>, who are big fans of the DC Comics character, joined Jason on set and fired off some important, hard-hitting questions â€” like whether Aquaman knows the Little Mermaid and where on Earth the superhero goes to the bathroom. Watch the clip above to see <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/family/How-Many-Kids-Does-Jason-Momoa-Have-46366987">Jason go into full-on dad mode</a> while hilariously answering their burning questions.</p>
