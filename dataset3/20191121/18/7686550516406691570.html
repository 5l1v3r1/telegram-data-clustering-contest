      <h2>The former Wales star has been vocal in his disapproval of Willis Halaholo and Johnny McNicholl's call-ups</h2>

      <p>Wales' 2008 and 2005 Grand Slam star <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/gavin-henson">Gavin Henson</a> has doubled down on his criticism of Willis Halaholo and Johnny McNicholl's call-ups.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand-born duo have been named in Wayne Pivac's first Wales squad, to face the Barbarians, having recently become eligible on residency ground.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/gavin-henson-slams-johnny-mcnicholl-17284150">Henson weighed in on the hot topic earlier this week,</a> tweeting on his official Twitter account: "This is so wrong."</p>
      <p>The former centre was then challenged by fans on social media before explaining and expanded on his thoughts after it was pointed out to him nine of Wales' Grand Slam winning squad of this year were born outside the country.</p>

      <p>New Zealander Hadleigh Parkes and Stockport-born Hallam Amos, who moved to Wales when he was nine or 10, both qualified for their adopted country on residency.</p>
      <p>Six - Jonathan Davies, George North, Ross Moriarty, Jake Ball, Tomas Francis and Jonah Holmes - were like Amos born in England with Gareth Anscombe being born in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Exeter Chiefs prop Francis and Leicester Tigers full-back or wing Holmes qualified for Wales through a grandparent and the others via a parent.</p>
      <p>Henson, in a follow-up tweet, wrote: "Parent or grandparent is totally fine. Residency should only count if theyâ€™ve spent a certain amount of time in that country in their childhood."</p>

      <p>It was then put to Henson that he had played with a number of imports - Sonny Parker, Brent Cockbain and Hal Luscombe, for example - during his time in the red jersey.</p>
      <p>"I'd give him (Parker) stick in every session and tell him how wrong it is," replied Henson, before adding that Parker agreed with him.</p>
      <p>The residency rule was debated on this week's Welsh Rugby Podcast. <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/thewelshrugbypodcast">You can listen here.</a></p>
