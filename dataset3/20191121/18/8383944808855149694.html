      <p>Amnesty International alleges the daughter of a senior leader of the Muslim Brotherhood group has been tortured and denied medical treatment in an Egyptian prison.<br/><br/>The London-based rights group released a statement Thursday deploring "inhumane" and "abusive" conditions under which Aisha el-Shater has been detained since her arrest in November 2018.<br/><br/>The statement adds the 39-year-old suffers from a rare blood disease that requires immediate hospitalization.<br/><br/>Aisha is daughter of Khairat el-Shater, long seen as the Brotherhood's most powerful leader. He has been jailed since 2013 after the military coup against Egypt's first and only democratically elected president Mohamed Morsi.<br/><br/>The group says that Aisha has been subjected to severe beating and electric shocks while in detention.<br/><br/>Amnesty International's Najia Bounaim has also urged authorities to end Aisha's solitary confinement.<br/><br/>Egypt has witnessed an unprecedented crackdown on dissent since President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi came to power in 2014. Egyptian authorities have launched a relentless crackdown on dissent, killing hundreds of his supporters and sending thousands to prison for inciting violence. Activists consider the repression the worst in Egypt's modern history.</p>
