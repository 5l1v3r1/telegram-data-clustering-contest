      <h1>Here’s Everything We Know About Harry Styles’ New Album ‘Fine Line’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:24:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:24</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Kelley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>’ highly anticipated sophomore album, <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Harry-styles/Fine-line">Fine Line</a></i> is on the way. Ahead of the drop, he’s already released two singles: <a href="https://genius.com/Harry-styles-watermelon-sugar-lyrics">“Watermelon Sugar”</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/Harry-styles-lights-up-lyrics">“Lights Up.”</a> This will be his first full-length since his <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Harry-styles/Harry-styles">self-titled debut</a> in 2017.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://genius.com/artists/one-direction">One Direction</a> member established himself as a classic rock-indebted soloist with his last outing. His debut was well-received, with 230,000 equivalent album unit sales in its first week, and <a href="https://genius.com/Harry-styles-sign-of-the-times-lyrics">“Sign of the Times”</a> made it all the way to No. 4 on the Hot 100. Now that <i>Fine Line</i> is on the way, Genius rounded up everything we know about the project ahead of its release.</p>
      <p>The Release Date</p>
      <p>The LP will arrive on Dec. 13.</p>
      <p>The Cover Art</p>
      <p>He posted the album cover on his socials:</p>

      <p>The Producers</p>
      <p><a href="https://genius.com/artists/jeff-bhasker">Jeff Bhasker</a>, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/kid-harpoon">Kid Harpoon</a>, and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/tyler-johnson">Tyler Johnson</a> are credited as producers.</p>
      <p>The Promotion</p>
      <p>Last month, mysterious posters that read “Do You Know Who You Are?” <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/looks-like-harry-styles-teasing-new-album-do-you-know-who-you-are-2555811">appeared around the world</a>.</p>

      <p>The phrase also became a <a href="https://doyouknowwhoyouare.com/">website</a> that generates short descriptions about each visitor.</p>
      <p>Styles later took on double duty on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>, where he performed his two singles live.</p>
      <p>The Recording Process</p>
      <p>A <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/harry-styles-cover-interview-album-871568/">Rolling Stone</a></i> profile described his <i>Fine Line</i> material as the “toughest, most soulful songs he’s written.” Styles put it this way: “It’s all about having sex and feeling sad.”</p>
      <p>He told the magazine that psychedelics played a role in the recording sessions at <a href="https://genius.com/artists/rick-rubin">Rick Rubin</a>’s Shangri-La Studios in Malibu. “We’d do mushrooms, lie down on the grass, and listen to <a href="https://genius.com/artists/paul-mccartney">Paul McCartney</a>’s <i><a href="https://genius.com/albums/Paul-mccartney/Ram">Ram</a></i> in the sunshine,” he said. “We’d just turn the speakers into the yard.”</p>
      <p>At one point, he played <a href="https://genius.com/artists/t-rex">T. Rex</a>’s <a href="https://genius.com/T-rex-cosmic-dancer-lyrics">“Cosmic Dancer”</a> over the intercom for a string quartet, using the glam-rock classic as a source of inspiration for a new song.</p>
