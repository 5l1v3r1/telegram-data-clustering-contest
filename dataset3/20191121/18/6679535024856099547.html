      <p>The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), Mangaluru, will showcase the historical contribution of the Saraswat Brahmin community to Mangaluru through a photo exhibition in Mangaluru.</p>
      <p>Titled ‘Tracing the Roots’, the exhibition features over 50 photographs capturing buildings and localities in Mangaluru that were built by the community.</p>
      <p>The photographs will be on display at Kodial Guthu (West), in Ballalbagh from November 23 [Saturday] to 30.</p>
      <p>The exhibition will also show small snippets of the oral history which preserves the memories of the migration of this community from Goa to the coast of Karnataka, said a release here.</p>
      <p>The exhibition will be inaugurated on Friday at 5 p.m. by Kasturi Mohan Pai, doctor and historian, and Subhas Basu, convener INTACH, Mangaluru. Entry to the opening ceremony is open to all.</p>
      <p>The photographs were taken by Deekshith Pai, an alumnus of Nitte Institute of Communication as a part of his final semester Bachelors degree project. Mr. Pai is currently doing his MA at Azim Premji University, Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>“The Saraswat Brahmin community’s migration and settling down in Mangaluru has been narrated from generation to generation to keep the history alive, which is why I wanted to show this through a combination of photographs, recorded history, and snippets of conversation which is oral history,” Mr. Pai said.</p>
      <p>“Major milestones in Mangaluru history including some of the oldest printing presses, mechanised oil mills, hotels, and cinema theatres were built by Saraswat Brahmins, which we have attempted to preserve through photographs,” said Nemiraj Shetty, a curator of this exhibition and founding member, INTACH, Mangaluru Chapter.</p>
