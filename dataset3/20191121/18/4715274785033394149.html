      <p>House of Marley’s (HOM) Liberate Air True Wireless Earphones, made from sustainable materials such as bamboo, recycled silicone, and fabric, are now available in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Liberate Air is the audio brand’s answer to better-for-the-planet alternatives that offer quality audio that doesn’t come at the expense of the environment. </p>
      <p>“We strive to reduce our environmental impact by using materials such as non-toxic silicone, wood-fiber composite resin, and ground plastic. From sustainably harvested materials to upcycled fabrics, our products are eco-friendly, including the packaging,” said Sunil Karamchandani, chief operating officer of Innovee Trading, the exclusive distributor of House of Marley in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Each pair of Liberate Air was engineered with audio systems that deliver HOM’s “signature sound” that highlights the energy, emotion, and detail of every recording. It is resistant to sweat and water droplets, and has a sensor-activated touch control technology feature for easy use.</p>
      <p>The wireless pair’s two-hour charging time offers a nine-hour onboard battery life and an additional 32-hour playtime stored in its case for another two hours of charging. It uses Bluetooth 5.0 that easily pairs with any device with Bluetooth connectivity within a 10-meter range</p>
      <p>Now available at Power Mac Center, Liberate Air is welcomed into the store’s comprehensive list of audio tech offerings through “Sounds Good! Coastal Cleanup,” a 100 percent sustainable event done in partnership with HOM and non-profit organization CORA (Communities Organized for Resource Allocation) Philippines, held at the Las Piñas-Parañaque Critical Habitat and Ecotourism Area.</p>

      <p>“With the recent ‘Sounds Good!’ coastal cleanup, our goal is to not only support HOM and its strong commitment to its advocacy, but also give back for the protection of the environment,” said Joey Alvarez, PMC director of product management, marketing, and space planning. </p>
