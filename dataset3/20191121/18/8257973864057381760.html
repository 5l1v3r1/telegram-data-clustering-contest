      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- A New Zealand woman and an Australian man celebrated their home countries and love of aviation by marrying in the air halfway between their home countries.</p>
      <p>New Zealander Cathy Valliant and Australian David Valliant <a href="https://7news.com.au/sunrise/on-the-show/plane-obsessed-couple-get-married-on-jetstar-flight-between-home-countries-c-567284">took Jetstar Flight 201</a> from Sydney to Auckland and exchanged vows at 37,000 feet when they hit the halfway point between the two countries.</p>
      <p>The ceremony <a href="https://www.facebook.com/JetstarAustralia/videos/544942566063897/?v=544942566063897&amp;external_log_id=68afaae190404079b019e5f16521b814&amp;q=jetstar%20wedding">was officiated by</a> a Jetstar ground crew member.</p>
      <p>The couple said airplanes have always been a big part of their relationship -- they met in 2011 as players of the <i>Airport City</i> computer game and first met in person at the Sydney airport two years later.</p>
      <p>A Jetstar representative<a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/australia-new-zealand-marriage-plane-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"> told CNN</a> "all customers [who had been booked on the flight] received an email beforehand saying there was going to be filming."</p>
      <p>The customers were allowed to change flights without extra charge if they did not want to be on camera.</p>
