      <h1>German Carmakers Fined For Forming Cartel to Fix Steel Prices</h1>
      <h2>Daimler, BMW, Volkswagen accused by competition watchdog</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:45:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-fines-bmw-daimler-vw-over-steel-cartel/a-51356153" target="_blank">DW</a></address>

        <b>Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen were together fined €100 million ($111 million) on Thursday for forming a cartel to fix steel prices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Germany’s competition watchdog, the Bundeskartellamt, imposed the fine, accusing the three companies of engaging in “anticompetitive practices” to buy steel.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the Bonn-based authority said Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW met regularly with steel producers “between 2004 and the end of 2013” to discuss uniform surcharges for purchasing the raw material.</p>
      <p>Unlawful prices resulting from these cartel meetings were in place until at least 2016, the statement added.</p>
      <p>The case refers specifically to “long steel,” a crucial element used in manufacturing car parts such as crankshafts, steering rods and cogs.</p>
      <p>The companies accepted the fine, the watchdog said. Volkswagen is expected to pay €48.7 million. BMW said it would pay €28 million, while Daimler will pay €23.5 million.</p>
      <p>The three carmakers are also under investigation by the European Commission for allegedly agreeing not to compete on emissions reduction technologies.</p>
      <p>The Bundeskartellamt has launched a number of recent probes into price rigging in the steel industry. In July 2018, the authority ordered six stainless steel producers to pay €205 million for price-fixing.</p>
      <p>A separate investigation targeting several producers for “flat steel” price rigging is still ongoing. German media reports have suggested fines in that case could amount to €500 million.</p>
