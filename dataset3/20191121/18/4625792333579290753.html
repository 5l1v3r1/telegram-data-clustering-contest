      <p>A 73-year-old Florida man wearing a “Make America Great Again” shirt robbed a bank but demanded less money after he was given more cash than he asked for, deputies say.</p>
      <p>Sandy Hawkins was arrested Tuesday after the Monday caper. According to a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office affidavit, Hawkins entered a Wells Fargo bank and demanded $1,100 from a bank teller. He implied he had a gun by putting his hand into the waistband of his pants, <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/florida/palm-beach-county/bank-robber-wearing-make-america-great-again-shirt-says-teller-gave-him-too-much-money">according</a> to WPLG.</p>
      <p>“This is a robbery,” Hawkins said. “I have a weapon.”</p>
      <p>The teller then began counting out $100 bills, ending at $2,000.</p>
      <p>“Hawkins told him it was too much and again demanded $1,100,” according to the affidavit.</p>
      <p>The teller complied with his request and handed Hawkins the amount he had originally demanded.</p>
      <p>During the heist, Hawkins was wearing a T-shirt with President Trump’s name and his campaign slogan “Make America Great Again” on the front.</p>
      <p>Hawkins was arrested after the manager of a local bar recognized him from surveillance footage. Deputies found Hawkins sitting near his home and said he quickly confessed to the crime.</p>
      <p>“I will make this easy,” he said and proceeded to take a bank deposit slip from his pocket that read, “Give me $1,000. Now, No Alarms, Hope to get Caught.”</p>
      <p>Hawkins was charged with robbery and is being held on a $50,000 bond.</p>
