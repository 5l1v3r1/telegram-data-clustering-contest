      <h1>Twitter will now let users hide replies worldwide</h1>

      <p>Twitter has been testing a feature which let users hide replies to their tweets. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-is-testing-a-new-hide-replies-feature/">It rolled out in Canada</a> earlier this year, and now the firm is bringing it worldwide.</p>
      <p>When using this feature, it puts control of the conversation back in the hands of the user and lets them put irrelevant replies behind an extra step. They aren’t removed completely, just hidden out of the way.</p>
      <p>“Here’s how it works. Anyone can choose to hide replies to their Tweets. Everyone can see and engage with hidden replies by tapping the grey icon that will appear on the Tweets. This way, you have more control over the conversations you start, but people can still see the entire conversation, <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2019/more-control-over-your-conversations-globally.html">Twitter said this week</a>. “We’re exploring more options around who can reply to or see specific conversations, and are testing engagement changes to see if these lead to healthier discussions.”</p>
      <p>Twitter says it’s rolling this feature out to iOS, Android, Twitter Lite and Twitter.com from today, so you should see it pretty soon.</p>
