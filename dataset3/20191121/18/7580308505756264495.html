      <p>Brendan Rodgers says he has no thoughts about leaving Leicester following reports that Tottenham made tentative inquiries before replacing sacked manager Mauricio Pochettino with Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>Spurs announced Mourinho as their new head coach on Wednesday, just hours after dismissing Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Rodgers moved to Leicester from Scottish champions Celtic in February and has made a huge impact at the King Power Stadium, taking the Foxes to second in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>When asked about links to other clubs during his pre-match press conference on Thursday, the Northern Irishman said he was happy and committed to the project at Leicester.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing to talk about on it. The game is full of gossip and speculation,” said Rodgers, whose side resume their Premier League campaign away at Brighton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“The only thing I will say is I was very happy here at Leicester, I’ve literally just joined the club in February.</p>
      <p>“Everything has been great since we’ve been in. We have a project here that we want to develop over the next number of years.</p>
      <p>James Maddison will be fit for the trip to Brighton after recovering from a minor calf injury that ruled him out of England’s Euro 2020 qualifier in Kosovo.</p>
      <p>The midfielder finally made his debut for England at Wembley in the 7-0 demolition of Montenegro and Rodgers was pleased to see him get his first cap for his country.</p>
      <p>“James is fine. He has trained the last few days and he is OK,” said the Leicester boss.</p>
      <p>“We’re all very happy for James (to make his England debut). He’s shown he’s a big-game player, with his goals scored against Arsenal, Liverpool, Spurs.”</p>
