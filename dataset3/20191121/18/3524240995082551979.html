      <h1>Netanyahu indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:16:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Adesola Ayo-Aderele</a></address>
      <p>Israel’s attorney general indicted Benjamin Netanyahu on a range of corruption charges Thursday, the justice ministry announced, potentially spelling an end to the prime minister’s decades-long political career.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit “decided to file charges against the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for offences of receiving a bribe, fraud, and breach of trust,” a ministry statement said.</p>
      <p>It said a note of the decision and a copy of the charges had been provided to the premier’s lawyers.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, who strongly denies all the charges, becomes the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted while in office.</p>
      <p>Mandelblit is due to give a public statement at 1730 GMT, with Netanyahu expected to respond.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is not legally required to resign, only if convicted with all appeals exhausted, but political pressure is likely to be intense.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu may now ask the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to grant him immunity from prosecution.</p>
      <p>Rightwinger Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009, is Israel’s longest-serving prime minister and dominates the country’s political scene.</p>
      <p>The decision comes as Netanayhu, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, is fighting for his political life.</p>
      <p>Israeli been without a government for nearly a year, with neither Netanyahu nor his centrist rival Benny Gantz able to form a coalition government following deadlocked elections in April and September.</p>
