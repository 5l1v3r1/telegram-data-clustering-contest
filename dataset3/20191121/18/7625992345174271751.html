      <h1>2 killed in aircraft mishap, Oklahoma Air Force base says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:23:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">CBS/AP</a></address>
      <p>Two airmen were killed Thursday in an accident involving two jets at an Air Force base in northwestern Oklahoma, military officials said. Vance Air Force Base <a href="https://www.vance.af.mil/News/Article/2022900/two-air-force-t-38-talons-mishap-news-release-002/">said in a statement</a> that two T-38 Talons, each with two people aboard, were taking part in a training mission when the mishap occurred shortly after 9 a.m.</p>
      <p>The military hasn't released the conditions of the others involved or the names of the deceased. "All we can disclose is that there are two fatalities as a result of the crash," said Airman Zoe Perkins with the base's public affairs office.</p>
      <p>An Air Force team will investigate to determine the cause of the crash, Perkins said. Footage <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/41355332/2-killed-in-aircraft-mishap-at-vance-afb-air-force-officials-say">from CBS affiliate KWTV</a> above the scene shows one aircraft upside down on grass near a runway and the second aircraft upright on the runway.</p>
      <p>The base in Enid, about 65 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, <a href="https://www.vance.af.mil/">said on its website</a> that the T-38 Talon is a twin-engine, high-altitude, supersonic jet used in a variety of jet pilot training roles. It is one of three types of aircraft, along with the T-1 Jayhawk and the T-6 Texan, used for pilot training at the base.</p>

      <p>The crash is the second incident involving a T-38 training jet in Oklahoma in the past 15 months. Air Force officials said an Air Force pilot ejected successfully before a jet trainer crashed in western Oklahoma in August 2018 and was found safe, while the jet crashed and exploded about 70 miles west of the base.</p>
      <p>Investigators said the pilot ejected after the jet developed engine trouble.</p>
