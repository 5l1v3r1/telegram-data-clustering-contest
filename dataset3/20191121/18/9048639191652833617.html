      <p><b>UNION PARISH, La. (KNOE) - </b>A Union Parish woman is accused of leading law enforcement on a car chase Wednesday then ditching her car to escape by jumping in D’Arbonne Lake. Deputies say she was also caught with over seven grams of meth, which she said did not belong to her.</p>
      <p>According to Johnny Gunter, media liaison for the Union Parish Sheriff's Office, it happened like this:</p>
      <p>
        <i>Two Union Parish sheriff’s deputies patrolling Pint Road near La. Hwy. 15 got behind a vehicle that suddenly accelerated to 60 mph. The deputies reported that the driver did not stop at the stop sign at Pleasure Island Road and started traveling at a much higher speed.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Sheriff Dusty Gates said that before the vehicle reached La. Hwy. 15, it ran off Pleasure Island Road, traveled across private property before hitting a guard rail in an attempt to get on Hwy. 15.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The driver, later identified as Cecelia A. Moore, 23, of 309 Pint Rd., Farmerville, exited the vehicle, ran to the lake, jumped in and started swimming.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Gates said the deputies then called for another deputy to bring a sheriff’s department boat to the location. A deputy and a Department of Wildlife and Fisheries’ agent retrieved Moore from the lake.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“As soon as they pulled her from the water she immediately stated “’those drugs aren’t mine,’” the sheriff said.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>A search of the vehicle turned up 7.7 grams of methamphetamine, 5.7 grams of marijuana, two blunts containing suspected marijuana and two Clonazpam pills.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Moore and her passenger, Hayward Kyle Crenshaw, 28, of 131 Swartz School Rd., Monroe, were arrested. Crenshaw also denied ownership of the drugs found in the car.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Both were charged with a misdemeanor count of possession of marijuana and felony counts of possession of meth and Clonazpam and possession with intent to distribute meth.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Moore was additionally booked into the Union Parish Detention Center for aggravated flight from an officer, a felony, illegal lane usage and two misdemeanor counts of resisting arrest.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Bail had not been set Thursday.</i>
