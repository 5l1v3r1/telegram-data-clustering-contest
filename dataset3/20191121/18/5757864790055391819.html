      <p>Things weren't looking good for the New Orleans Saints on the evening of November 8, 1970, during a televised game against the Detroit Lions at Tulane Stadium. Though Saints quarterback Billy Kilmer had managed to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=wickersham_seth&amp;id=5648473">connect</a> with receiver Al Dodd on a 17-yard pass that stopped the clock, New Orleans was still down 17-16 with just two seconds left in the game. Worse yet, they were on their own 37-yard line—leaving 63 yards between them and the end zone.</p>
      <p>Saints head coach J.D. Roberts, who had only been hired the week before, huddled with offensive coordinator Don Heinrich to quickly consider their options. There weren’t any. Suddenly, kicker Tom Dempsey, who had joined the team the year before, materialized. “I can kick it,” Dempsey told Roberts.</p>
      <p>Dempsey would later recall that he didn’t know exactly how far the ball had to travel or that it would be an NFL record if he nailed it. If he had, he said, maybe he would’ve gotten too nervous and shanked it. But kicking the ball was what Dempsey did, even though he was born with only half of a right foot.</p>
      <p>Heinrich sighed. There was no other choice. “Tell Stumpy to get ready,” he said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Dempsey was <a href="http://americanfootballkickinghalloffame.com/project/tom-dempsey/">born</a> on January 12, 1947, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin,</b> and later moved with his family to California. As a student at San Dieguito High School in Encinitas, California, Dempsey appeared unbothered by the congenital defect that resulted in a partial right foot and four missing fingers on his right hand. Dempsey wrestled and ran track. In football, he <a href="https://www.thestoryoftexas.com/discover/artifacts/tom-dempsey-shoe-spotlight-092515">used</a> his burly frame—he would eventually be 6 feet, 2 inches tall and weigh 255 pounds—to clobber opposing players as an offensive lineman. When coaches wanted to send opponents flying, they called in Dempsey.</p>
      <p>After high school, Dempsey went on to attend Palomar Junior College in San Marcos, California, where he played football as a defensive end. At one point, when the team was in need of a kicker, the coach asked his players to line up and do their best to send the ball in the air. None kicked harder or farther than Dempsey, who became the kicker for the team and performed while barefoot, wrapping the end of his foot in athletic tape.</p>

      <p>Playing at Palomar prepared Dempsey for a dual role as both lineman and kicker. But his strength, which made him so formidable on the field, occasionally got him into trouble on the sidelines, and he would eventually be kicked off the Palomar team for punching one of his coaches. After the incident, Dempsey tried out for the Green Bay Packers but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/football/super-bowl-tom-dempsey-former-nfl-kicker-is-dealing-with-dementia.html">found</a> the physicality of professional players a little too much for him to handle. Rather than get into on-field collisions as an offensive lineman, he decided to focus solely on the aptitude he seemed to have for kicking. He eventually earned a spot on the San Diego Chargers <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=smTl55yl83wC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=san+diego+chargers+taxi+squad&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYxbLM2PnlAhWviOAKHb-iAPwQ6AEwAXoECAIQAg#v=onepage&amp;q=san%20diego%20chargers%20taxi%20squad&amp;f=false">practice squad</a> in 1968. There, head coach Sid Gillman decided to encourage his choice of position—with some modifications.</p>
      <p>Gillman enlisted an orthopedist to help <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2010-oct-31-la-sp-crowe-20101101-11-story.html">develop</a> a special leather shoe for Dempsey to wear. The boot had a <a href="https://www.si.com/2014/05/20/nfl-history-in-95-objects-tom-dempsey-boot">block</a> of leather 1.75 inches thick at one end and was mostly flat. Instead of kicking it soccer-style, as most players do today, Dempsey was able to use his leg like a mallet and hammer the ball with a flat, blunt surface.</p>
      <p>The shoe, which cost $200 to fabricate, came in handy when Dempsey joined the Saints in 1969. He <a href="http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/64526706">made</a> 22 out of 41 field goals his rookie year and found himself in the Pro Bowl. But the 1970 season was comparatively dismal, and the Saints were holding a 1-5-1 record when they met the Detroit Lions on that night in November.</p>
      <p>With two seconds left, “Stumpy” (Dempsey found the nickname affectionate rather than offensive) trotted onto the field. At 63 yards, he would have to best the then-record set by Baltimore Colts kicker Bert Rechichar in 1953 by seven yards.</p>
      <p>No one appeared to think this was within the realm of possibility—you could almost <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjqiq4S9bqA">hear a chuckle</a> in CBS commentator Don Criqui's voice when he announced that Dempsey would be attempting the feat. Even the Lions seemed apathetic, not overly concerned with attempting to smother the play.</p>
      <p>The ball was snapped by Jackie Burkett and received by Joe Scarpati, who gave it a quarter-turn. Dempsey remembered advice once given to him by kicking legend Lou “The Toe” Groza: Keep your head down and follow through. He took a step toward the ball and swung his leg like a croquet mallet, smashing into the football with a force that those on or near the field compared to a loud bang or a cannon. It sailed 63 yards to the goal post, which at the time was positioned directly on the goal line, and just made it over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Below, the referee threw his hands in the air to indicate the kick was good, punctuating it with a little hop of excitement. Dempsey was swarmed by his teammates and coaches. Don Criqui’s attitude in the booth quickly switched from amusement to incredulity. The Saints had won, 19-17.</p>
      <p>“I don’t believe this,” Criqui exclaimed.</p>
      <p>Neither could fans. In an era before instant replay, ESPN, or YouTube, you either caught Dempsey’s game-winning play or you heard about it at work or school the next week. Owing to its fleeting existence in the moment, schoolyards and offices filled with stories about how Dempsey’s boot may have somehow been augmented with a steel plate or other modification to boost his kicking prowess.</p>
      <p>No such thing occurred, though that didn’t stop criticism. Tex Schramm, an executive with the Dallas Cowboys and chairman of the NFL’s competition committee, thought the shoe was an unfair advantage that allowed Dempsey to smash the ball like a golf club hitting a dimpled target. In 1977, the NFL instituted the “Tom Dempsey Rule,” which mandates that anyone and everyone has to wear a shoe shaped like a full foot. There would be no more allowances for special orthopedic shapes.</p>
      <p>Dempsey appeared to take it all in stride. Shortly after his victorious kick, he received a letter from President <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/535327/facts-about-richard-nixon">Richard Nixon</a> congratulating him on his inspirational demonstration. Immediately after the game, police officers went in to congratulate him by handing him cases of Dixie beer. Dempsey's girlfriend (and future wife) Carlene recalled that he didn’t come home for days due to rampant partying. When he finally settled down, they got married.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Dempsey spent a total of 11 years in the NFL,</b> playing for the Saints, the Philadelphia Eagles, the Los Angeles Rams, the Houston Oilers, and finally the Buffalo Bills. In total, he made <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DempTo20.htm">159 field goals</a> out of 258 attempts. For the next several decades, he would work as a salesman in the oil industry and manage a car lot before retiring in 2008 and settling down back near New Orleans, where he lives today. Over the years, Dempsey has made several appearances at autograph shows, where he was regularly peppered with questions about the one kick that defined his career.</p>
      <p>Almost as amazing as the kick was its attrition in the record books. While several other men managed to tie Dempsey’s record, it wasn’t until Matt Prater of the Denver Broncos kicked a 64-yard field goal on December 8, 2013, that it was finally <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000294584/article/matt-prater-breaks-fieldgoal-record-with-64yarder">broken</a>—almost 43 years to the day. Some observers note that most of these notable field goals took place in Denver, where the air is thin and presumably more hospitable to kicking for distance. Dempsey managed it in New Orleans—and without toes.</p>
      <p>Curiously, Dempsey’s legendary play was actually foreshadowed one year earlier. On October 5, 1969, he <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/10/15/Tom-Dempsey-A-reluctant-hero/8891435038400/">kicked</a> a 55-yard field goal in Los Angeles. That was just one yard shy of the record he would obliterate the following year.</p>
