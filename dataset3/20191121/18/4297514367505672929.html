        <b>It would take 27 years in the most affordable city in the Lower Mainland</b>
      </p>
      <p>Are you saving up for a house? Well, better prepare yourself because you could be on a budget for more than 200 years.</p>
      <p>That not-so-great news comes from real estate firm Zoocasa, which looked at how long a median income household would take to save up for a new home, based on saving 20 per cent of their salary.</p>
      <p>The firm found that in Vancouverâ€™s West End, a median income household of $65,327, it would take 218 years to afford a whopping $2.9 million benchmark price detached home.</p>
      <p>West Vancouver was the second least affordable area, with a median income of $89,808 and a timespan of 134 years before they could afford to buy a $2.5 million detached home.</p>

      <p>On the other end of the scale, a Maple Ridge household with a median income of $86,178 would only need to wait 27 years before they could afford a $804,200 detached home.</p>
      <p>In Surrey, the fastest growing city in the Lower Mainland, a median household income of $77,494 and benchmark detached home price of $979,767 would leave a family waiting 46 years to afford the place.</p>
      <p>In the more affluent , but also much more expensive South Surrey and White Rock region, a $80,430 median income would entail saving up for 67 years before being able to buy a $1.3 million home.</p>
