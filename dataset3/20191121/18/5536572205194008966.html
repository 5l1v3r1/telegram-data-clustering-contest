      <h1>Tom Brady Explains Why He “Liked” Antonio Brown’s IG Apology To The Patriots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:04:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:04</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>On Tuesday, former New England Patriot Antonio Brown suddenly took to social media and delivered a heartfelt apology for a September tweet he made that took shots at owner Robert Kraft after the team waived him. Brown played just one game and lasted just eleven days with the franchise before he was cut.</p>
      <p>Numerous Patriots that included Stephon Gilmore, Dont’a Hightower, and James White “liked” the post on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Quarterback Tom Brady was another one who ‘liked’ that post, so naturally, reporters wanted to pick his brain about it.</p>
      <p>From the <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2019/11/21/tom-brady-patriots-explain-why-they-liked-antonio-browns-apology-to-robert-kraft/">Boston Herald</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“I liked him. We had a great rapport when we were here,” Brady told the Herald. “I’m trying to support him to be the best person that he can be, that’s all.”<br/><br/>So Brady wasn’t trying to sway Mr. Kraft into bringing Brown back?<br/><br/>“It’s that time of year,” said Brady. “People put a lot of words in people’s mouths. It’s just part of the world we’re living in.”</blockquote>
      <p>Brady continued as he went into more details:</p>
      <blockquote>“For me, I’m just at this stage of my career, I’m 42 years old. I want to help everybody I can that I come across in this locker room, my friends, to be the best they can be. And how I can support them the best way possible,” he said. “I feel like I have a lot of experience. Part of being a leader in this locker room is trying to help people understand the challenges of being in the positions that they’re in. I think that’s a really fun thing for me, as I’ve gotten older, is to embrace that, like Drew Bledsoe did for me, like Lawyer Milloy did for me, like Tedy Bruschi did for me, like Mike Vrabel did for me, like Rodney Harrison did for me. And now, I’m in their position, so, it’s my responsibility to convey to them what it takes to have a great, successful career.”</blockquote>
      <p>Gilmore and Phillip Dorsett told the Herald that they were only reacting to the photo Brown posted with the apology, which was of him celebrating with Brady. It doesn’t look like any of the players want to come out and say they are endorsing his return, but we can clearly read between the lines.</p>
