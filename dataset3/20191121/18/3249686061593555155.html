      <p>It's been three years since <b>Rainbow</b> had disbanded but that doesn't seem to affect the girl's friendship as they all remained close and always come together to celebrate the group's anniversary. </p>
      <p>Well, this year might have been different, even though we are happy to see them hanging out together for celebrating their anniversary. This year the group decided to take a different approach and decided to release a song titled "Aurora" in celebration of their tenth anniversary. Which was dropped last week, I hope you guys have a chance to listened to it, it's a really great song. If you haven't you can check it out here:</p>

      <p>In the photos, you can clearly see Hyungyoung is rocking a yellow plaid dress with matching yellow sunglasses. Her hair is in pigtail hairstyle which goes great along with her dress.</p>
      <p>While her photo is getting praise with positive comments by her fans, one malicious commenter makes a rant on her photo and demanding the former idol to cover up.</p>

        <b>"By posting a photo of yourself that makes it so obvious that you got a boob job, is that your way of telling everyone you a boob job? If it's obvious, you should cover-up".</b>
      </p>
      <p>But nonetheless the idol clap-backed at the malicious commenter with a classy response, she responded saying, </p>
      <p>
        <b>"I'm sorry, but if you didn't write this comment to tell everyone that your brain is empty, I suggest you delete it".</b>
