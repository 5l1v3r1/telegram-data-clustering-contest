        <b>Brighton and Hove Albion manager Graham Potter has provided some positive news on Republic of Ireland international Aaron Connolly after his recent injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old was replaced with a groin complaint during the Seagulls' 3-1 defeat at Manchester United before the international break.</p>
      <p>The Galway man made his senior international bow for Mick McCarthy's senior side in the EURO 2020 qualifying draw against Georgia on October 12th but missed the recent Aviva Stadium ties against New Zealand and Denmark with the injury.</p>
      <p>Connolly had impressed enough in Stephen Kenny's Irish under-21 set-up to earn his full international debut.</p>
      <p>Speaking today ahead of Saturday's Premier League visit of high-flying Leicester City, Brighton boss Graham Potter said this weekend will come too soon for Connolly, but he should be available thereafter.</p>
      <p>"Aaron Connolly will miss the game this weekend with the same groin problem from the Manchester United game, but hopefully he'll be back for next weekend."</p>

      <p>That means Connolly may well be available for selection for Brighton's trip to Anfield to take on league leaders Liverpool on Saturday week, November 30th.</p>
      <p>Potter also gave an update on Shane Duffy, who captained the Republic of Ireland in Monday night's 1-1 draw with the Danes, which leaves them needing to progress through two play-off ties in March to progress to next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>"Shane Duffy and Davy Propper are also back fine. Steven Alzate got back late last night, but he's okay too."</p>
      <p>Lewis Dunk will miss this weekend's match at the Amex Stadium through suspension, having picked up his fifth yellow card of the campaign at Old Trafford last time out.</p>
      <p>The Leicester City game comes too soon forÂ Bernardo and Jose Izquierdo, while there was a more positive update on Belgian international Leandro Trossard and Adam Webster.</p>
      <p>"Leandro Trossard rolled his ankle while he was away - it was more precautionary that he was left out of the Belgian squad.</p>
      <p>"He's trained with us and he's fine for the weekend.</p>
      <p>"Adam Webster has a chance of being fit for the weekend and it's a lot earlier than expected. He's trained today [Thursday] and we'll see how he is tomorrow [Friday]. We have good options in that area of the field."</p>
      <p>Brighton currently sit in 11th position in the Premier League table, with fifteen points from their opening twelve games.</p>
