      <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph denies an allegation from Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett that Rudolph called him a racial slur moments before the two got into a brawl at the end of last week's nationally-televised game.</p>
      <p>Garrett, who is black, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28130757/during-appeal-myles-garrett-accused-mason-rudolph-using-racial-slur">made the allegation </a>during an appeal hearing for his indefinite suspension from the NFL, according to ESPN.</p>
      <p>The two men got into a physical altercation in the final moments of last week's game in Pittsburgh. During the skirmish, Garrett ripped off Rudolph's helmet and hit him over the head with it.</p>
      <p>“Mason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident Thursday night in Cleveland," the Steelers said in a statement to <i>The Washington Examiner</i>. "He will not discuss this accusation any further, and his focus remains on preparation for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.”</p>
      <p>Rudolph, who is white, has not been suspended as a result of the incident, but sources told ESPN a fine is likely.</p>
      <p>Two other players who were involved in the fight were handed down shorter suspensions. Rudolph declined to comment on the incident or Garrett's accusation during a briefing with reporters after practice Wednesday.</p>
