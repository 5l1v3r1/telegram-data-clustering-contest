      <p>Mark Millar, of DIY SOS, helped kickstart an action-packed first day at WorldSkills UK LIVE with a rallying call to young people ready to achieve their potential and be the best of British.</p>
      <p>Mark was appearing at the NEC event, BBC viewers saw his Big Build team transform a Birmingham house on TV on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The presenter said: “Don’t think of it as a day off school, this is a day you can get yourselves concreted into the industry, if you excuse the pun. I can tell you now, it’s the best thing I ever did.</p>
      <figure>

      <p>“When I left school, I wanted to be a chef, then my dad turned up and pushed me forward into this industry, and I have been blessed, absolutely blessed because in this country we have the best tradespeople in the world.</p>
      <p>“We make the best houses, the best properties, the best hospitals and the best homes.</p>

      <p>“The reasons we do it is the skills base is fantastic and we need to keep that going.</p>
      <p>“Don’t shy away from it, don’t think of it as an industry where you work in the cold and the rain.</p>
      <p>“Yes, you will be doing that as well but I have had an amazing chance to go from my toolbox to the camera and meet incredible people with incredible skills</p>
      <p>“Think of this as a day you can find a way in to a brilliant career. This is not about getting up, doing your nine to five and earning your wages, this about getting a skill for life, a skill that you can share.”</p>

      <h3>Virtual rollercoasters and high-tech futures</h3>

      <p>Cutting-edge technology was a key theme at this year’s WorldSkills UK LIVE, with visitors invited to explore the latest virtual worlds in industries crying out for fresh talent.</p>
      <p>The heights that can be achieved by students were demonstrated in breath-taking form at a virtual reality theme park ride where visitors could sit in a moving platform.</p>
      <p>The concept was designed by students at Middlesex University eight years ago and is now ready to be rolled out for disabled guests at Thorpe Park.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The motion driven experience – similar to simulations used in a recent episode of The Apprentice – left a deep impression on young thrill-seekers.</p>
      <p>The simulator blends virtual reality motion simulation showing the rollercoaster ride with replicated physical movement, based on open source technologies available in schools and colleges.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Nia Edwards, 18, of Dudley College, found it an exhilarating experience far removed from the clunky image virtual reality sometimes attracts.</p>
      <p>Nia said: “It was great and a bit scary, when the rollercoaster went fast my heart was racing and I felt like my breath had been taken away. It felt like real life.”</p>
      <p>Nia, from Dudley, wants to be an aerospace engineer and, in her second year attending WorldSkills UK LIVE, has found no shortage of inroads to the industry.</p>
      <p>She said: “There’s always something new to do here, and the event is always growing across the different areas.</p>
      <p>"There are the traditional industries as well as the latest technological stuff. My brother is my main inspiration for wanting to go into aerospace because he was researching the industry.</p>
      <p>"Here you not only get to try the latest technologies but you can talk to people about how to break into the industry as well.”</p>
      <figure>

      <p>Zariah Mlobane, 18, also from Dudley College, gave another vote of approval to the virtual reality simulator after stepping off the moving platform.</p>
      <p>Zariah said: “I wasn’t expecting it to feel so realistic, I was really taken back. There’s so much to explore at WorldSkills UK LIVE that you wouldn’t expect when you walk through the doors. No matter how old you are or what career you are looking to, there’s something to enjoy.”</p>
      <p>The advanced simulator, which is called a ‘motion driven experience’ and requires core tech skills including coding, was overseen by Neil Melton, of Automation at Middlesex University,</p>

      <p>Neil said: “This started as a student project eight years ago to develop a static theme park ride and it developed from there. It just shows what can be achieved.”</p>
      <p>Neil added: “If you can code one of these, you can code industrial robots and there’s a whole sphere of work out there you can tap into.”</p>
      <p>A vast range of other high-tech projects clicked into action on the day, including the latest aviation technology and virtual reality construction tools.</p>

      <h3>Street art blazes way to success</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Striking graffiti art murals brought a Brummie urban flavour to the opening day of WorldSkills UK LIVE – with young people contributing to a collaborative wall design.</p>
      <p>Matt Reeves and David Brown, of Digbeth-based Graffiti Artist, also gave out hundreds of personalised name designs to visitors at their stand.</p>
      <p>The artists, appearing with manufacturers’ organisation Make UK to promote STEM subjects, are creating the ‘mind map’ over two days at WorldSkills UK LIVE.</p>
      <p>Matt, a graphic recorder, said: “We’re working with the kids to drill down what they know about STEM, which stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.</p>
      <p>“They are at the core of so many careers and they open up all kinds of options when you get older, for example mathematics is not just about pure numbers, you can go on to all kinds of things, such as architecture and huge construction projects.</p>
      <p>“The STEM subjects can seem quite dreary to kids and we’re using the graffiti side of it to get them interested and talk to them about what they can go on to achieve.”</p>
      <p>Leading Birmingham street artist David Brown, aka Panda, was in quick-fire mode as he turned around 300 visitors' names into colourful street art designs at the busy stand.</p>
      <p>The finished 'mind map' will be displayed at Make UK's Technology Hub in Aston.</p>
      <p>On a day when street art met highly advanced military technology, many young people found new areas to explore outside their chosen fields.</p>

      <p>Hattie George, 17, of South Bromsgrove High Sixth Form, said: “I was mainly here because I want to go into health and social sciences but I wanted to see what took my interest.</p>
      <p>“There were so much I wasn’t expecting, including the police events where they showed us the police cars and how they take fingerprints, it was really interesting.</p>
      <p>“It’s a massive event but there’s huge variety and everyone’s really friendly.”</p>
