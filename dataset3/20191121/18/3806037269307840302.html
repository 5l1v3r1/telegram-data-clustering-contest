      <h1>D'Angelo Russell Signs With Li-Ning and Way of Wade</h1>
      <h2>Announced by Dwyane Wade himself.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:48:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Dwyer</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a> guard <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/dangelo-russell">D’Angelo Russell</a> has officially signed with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/li-ning">Li-Ning</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/li-ning-way-of-wade">Way of Wade</a>. After Russell’s contract with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike">Nike</a> expired last season, he sported footwear from both <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/puma">PUMA</a> and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/adidas">adidas</a> on the court. However, the 2019 <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nba-all-star">NBA All-Star</a> has worn various Li-Ning silhouettes since the preseason, making his inking of a deal seem somewhat inevitable.</p>
      <p>Long-time Li-Ning endorser <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/dwyane-wade">Dwyane Wade</a> broke the news of the partnership on his Instagram account with a photo that was also quickly shared by Russell. The former #2 overall pick was effusive in his praise for Wade, stating that he grew up admiring the former <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a> guard’s game. Russell will join <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/cj-mccollum">CJ McCollum</a> of the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/portland-trail-blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> as the Chinese sportswear brand’s foremost NBA endorser, and will mainly wear the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/li-ning-way-of-wade-7">Way of Wade 7</a>. As Russell is one of the NBA’s most popular young players, it’s not unrealistic to assume that he’ll receive a signature silhouette in the near future as well.</p>
      <p>Since Wade retired at the conclusion of the 2018-19 NBA season, he’s been taking a more hands-on role in the cultivation of his WoW line. In October, Wade brought fellow Miami-based heavy-hitter <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/rick-ross">Rick Ross</a> into the fold with a two-shoe collection, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/rick-ross-li-ning-way-of-wade-7-essence-wow-release-date">marking Li-Ning’s first artist partnership</a>. Russell’s addition is another milestone, as he’s the first player that Wade has handpicked to represent Li-Ning.</p>
