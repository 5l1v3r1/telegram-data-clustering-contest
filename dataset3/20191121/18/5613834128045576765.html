      <h1>Wes Craven’s Estate Begins Taking ‘A Nightmare on Elm Street’ Pitches [Exclusive]</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>Outside of Jason Voorhees and the <i>Friday the 13th</i> franchise that’s trapped in legal hell, the big horror bads are all making a big comeback.</p>
      <p><b>Bloody Disgusting</b> broke the news of Michael Myers and <i>Halloween</i>‘s escape from Dimension Films, which resulted in Blumhouse aligning with Universal and Miramax to bring the Shape back to the big screen. We also were the first to tell you that Leatherface and the Sawyer family will return in a new <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> from Legendary Pictures and<i> Evil Dead</i> director Fede Alvarez, who will both produce. Bloody also revealed first to our readers that Spyglass is developing a brand new <i>Scream</i> that will resurrect Ghostface.</p>
      <p>But what about<b> Wes Craven</b>‘s <i>other</i> horror icon?</p>
      <p>We <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3584709/the-u-s-rights-to-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-and-freddy-krueger-have-reverted-back-to-wes-cravens-estate/">exclusively told you two months ago</a> that the U.S. rights to <b><i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i></b> have reverted back to Wes Craven’s estate. This also included its red and green sweater/fedora-wearing dream demon, <b>Freddy Krueger</b>.</p>
      <p>Now, <b>Bloody Disgusting can also exclusively report that Craven’s estate has begun work on resurrecting Freddy as they are <i>actively</i> taking pitches for a new <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>.</b> While we don’t know exactly what the estate’s plans are – or if they have any distributor/financial deals in place – we have heard that they are looking for <i>both</i> feature film pitches and also concepts for a possible HBO Max series. Again, we do not know the extent of their plans – and it’s also entirely possible they don’t know what they want either.</p>
      <p>Let’s talk about this for a second.</p>
      <p>The<i> Elm Street</i> situation is less complicated than that of<i> Friday the 13th</i> in that Craven created Freddy Krueger and wrote the original screenplay for the New Line Cinema-produced/released <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>. In layman’s terms, Wes Craven’s estate is the sole owner of the U.S. rights to Freddy and <i>NOES</i>, while New Line Cinema continues to own the international rights.</p>
      <p>Craven’s estate can keep it simple and make a deal with Warner Bros./New Line Cinema and keep it all in the family. Or, a slightly more complicated route would be to align with a different domestic distributor (Sony, Lionsgate, Universal, etc.) that would partner with Warner/New Line, the latter of which would handle the international release.</p>
      <p>What we don’t know is this: does the Craven estate have a deal in place already or are they taking pitches that they’ll, in turn, develop and use to sell to a distributor?</p>
      <p>The good news here is that – unlike <i>Friday the 13th</i> – there’s nothing holding Craven’s estate back from giving Freddy and <i>NOES</i> back to the fans. And by the sound of it, they’re already working diligently to make sure our dreams come true.</p>
      <p>Watch this spot for more info as it comes in. What are you expecting/hoping for from the future of <i>Elm Street</i>?</p>
