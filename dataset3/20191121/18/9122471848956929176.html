      <h1>Myles Garrett Accuses Mason Rudolph Of Using “Racial Slur” Before Fight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:33:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive lineman Myles Garrett has reportedly accused Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph of using a racial slur leading up to last Thursday’s melee between the two teams.</p>
      <p>Garrett slammed his helmet into Rudolph’s head at the end of last week’s Browns-Steelers game. The two players were engaged in a scuffle on the ground with time running out in Cleveland’s win. Garrett has been suspended indefinitely by the NFL.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28130757/during-appeal-myles-garrett-accused-mason-rudolph-using-racial-slur">ESPN is reporting</a> that Garrett accused Rudolph of using a racial slur. This accusation reportedly came during his appeal hearing.</p>
      <blockquote>In an appeal hearing with the NFL on Wednesday, Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett alleged that Mason Rudolph called him a racial slur just prior to last week’s brawl on “Thursday Night Football,” sources told ESPN’s Josina Anderson and Adam Schefter, an accusation the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback strongly denies.</blockquote>
      <p>Rudolph apologized for his role in the brawl on Wednesday, though he denies using a racial slur.</p>
      <p>“Mason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident Thursday night in Cleveland,” a Steelers spokesman said in a statement. “He will not discuss this accusation any further and his focus remains on preparation for Sunday’s game against the Cincinnati Bengals.”</p>
      <p>Rudolph said he should have handled things better while speaking to reporters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“I should’ve done a better job handling that situation,” <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28130757/during-appeal-myles-garrett-accused-mason-rudolph-using-racial-slur">Rudolph said</a>. “I have no ill will towards Myles Garrett. Great respect for his ability as a player. And I know that if Myles could go back, he would handle the situation differently.</p>
      <p>“As for my involvement last week, there’s no acceptable excuse. The bottom line is I should’ve done a better job keeping my composure in that situation and [not] fall short of what I believe it means to be a Pittsburgh Steeler and a member of the NFL.”</p>
      <p>Rudolph’s agent has since accused Garrett of lying.</p>

      <p>Rudolph is not facing a suspension as a result of his role in the incident. Garrett was suspended indefinitely, though he’s appealing to get it reduced.</p>
      <p>The Browns and Steelers will play again in two weeks.</p>
