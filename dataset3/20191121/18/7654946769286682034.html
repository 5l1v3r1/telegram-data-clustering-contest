      <h1>MTA completely floods subway station entrance to test new water blocking gate</h1>

      <p>The MTA made a splash in lower Manhattan when it filled the entrance of a subway station with several feet of water Wednesday to test out a new flood-proofing plan.</p>
      <p>The Broadway station looked more like a kiddie pool than a transit hub for a few hours — due to a water blocking device, dubbed a “flex-gate” — which baffled straphangers.</p>
      <p>“MTA explain yourself,” passerby Kaye Blevgard tweeted at the agency, along with a photo of the water-logged station.</p>
      <p>The agency’s social media team first quipped, “We’re pivoting to submarines” — before explaining the test-run is part of a plan to combat climate change.</p>
      <p>“But actually, we were testing a new ‘flex gate,’ which is a flood barrier that would allow us to seal off a subway entrance. We ‘test flood’ the entrance for four hours to make sure it was installed correctly, which it was!”<a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/1197288322646839297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197288322646839297&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgothamist.com%2Fnews%2Fyes-mta-completely-flooded-subway-entrance-reason"> it tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>The agency later added, “We’re investing in capital projects around the system to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate,” <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/yes-mta-completely-flooded-subway-entrance-reason">according to Gothamist</a>.</p>
      <p>During major storms, MTA workers can unroll the gate and secure it against a metal lip, which runs along the edge of a subway stairwell opening, to keep water from rushing into the underground.</p>
      <p>During Superstorm Sandy, subway stations and tunnels were damaged flood water, and agency is still trying to repair some of them.</p>
      <p>It’s one in a series of steps city and state agencies are taking to try to protect flood-vulnerable Lower Manhattan from the higher seas and more powerful storms brought on by climate change.</p>
      <p>The City Council last week signed off on a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/city-council-approves-1-5b-project-to-weather-proof-lower-manhattan/">$1.5 billion project</a> to help protect the Lower East Side by raising East River Park by eight feet, which will help shield the neighborhood from the nearby East River.</p>
      <p>The MTA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday.</p>
