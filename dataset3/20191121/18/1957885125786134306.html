      <h1>First look at Valve's Half-Life: Alyx</h1>
      <h2>Free to Index VR headset owners.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Valve has now officially announced its next Half-Life game, titled Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
      <p>As we heard earlier this week, Alyx will be set between Half-Life and Half-Life 2. You'll play as the latter's Alyx Vance as she and her father mount a secret resistance to the alien Combine.</p>
      <p>Alyx is set to launch on Steam in March 2020 and be compatible with all PC-based VR headsets.</p>
      <p>It'll cost $60 on its own - or it'll be free if you have shelled out for a Valve Index headset.</p>
      <p>Valve describes Alyx as being in the vein of a "classic Half-Life game" with a focus on exploration, puzzles, combat and story.</p>

      <p>"Everyone at Valve is excited to be returning to the world of Half-Life," Valve founder Gabe Newell said. "VR has energised us. We've invested a lot of ourselves in the technology. But we're also game developers at heart, and to be devoting ourselves to a VR game this ambitious is just as exciting.</p>
      <p>"For that to come in the form of Half-Life feels like the culmination of a lot things we care a lot about: truly great games, cutting edge technology, and open platforms. We can't wait for people to experience this."</p>
