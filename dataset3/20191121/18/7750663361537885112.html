      <h1>Tottenham Hotspur 'have no plans to appoint sporting director'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> reportedly does not have any plans to appoint a sporting director to work above new head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Spurs confirmed Mourinho as their new head coach on Wednesday morning, with the Portuguese taking the place of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a>, who was relieved of his duties on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>There have been suggestions that a revamp could see Levy introduce a sporting director to work above the club's new boss.</p>
      <p>However, according to the <i>London Evening Standard</i>, the capital side are not currently interested in filling the position with Levy set to remain in charge of transfers.</p>
      <p>Mourinho - sacked by Manchester United last December - has signed a contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium until the end of the 2022-23 campaign.</p>
      <p>Spurs will be looking for their first Premier League win since the end of September when they travel to bitter rivals West Ham United on Saturday afternoon.</p>
