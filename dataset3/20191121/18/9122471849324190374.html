      <p>Ohio State is on the verge of clinching a spot in the Big Ten Championship with a win this weekend against Penn State. Ryan Day’s squad probably doesn’t need much motivation heading into this game, but they definitely received a boost this afternoon.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes will have Chase Young back for this showdown. He missed the past two games due to a suspension from the NCAA.</p>
      <p>Penn State enters this weekend as massive underdogs against Ohio State. Nonetheless, these rivalry games usually come down to the wire.</p>
      <p>With only two days remaining until Ohio State takes the field for its last home game of the season, the team released a hype video on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>This should have the Buckeyes pumped to play this weekend at the Horseshoe.</p>
      <p>Most analysts have Ohio State winning this weekend against Penn State, including <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/analyst-score-prediction-for-ohio-state-penn-state">Ralph D. Russo of the Associate Press.</a> He believes the Buckeyes will defeat the Nittany Lions by three touchdowns.</p>
      <p>A victory on Saturday would strengthen Ohio State’s argument for the No. 1 spot in the College Football Playoff rankings.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
      <p>Do you think Ohio State will remain perfect on the season?</p>
