      <h1>Mason Rudolph’s Attorney Responds To Claims That He Used Racial Slur Towards Myles Garrett Before TNF Brawl (TWEET)</h1>

      <p>That was quick.</p>
      <p>We just told you about <a href="https://www.totalprosports.com/2019/11/21/breaking-myles-garrett-claims-mason-rudolph-called-him-a-racial-slur-before-tnf-brawl/">Myles Garrett’s claim</a> that Mason Rudolph used a racial slur towards him before that ugly helmet-swinging incident during last week’s Steelers-Browns TNF contest.</p>
      <p>Garrett made the claim while appealing his suspension on Wednesday, and Adam Schefter revealed the claim today on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Shortly after the claim was made public, Rudolph’s attorney issued his own statement on behalf of his client, claiming that Garrett’s accusations are a “lie.”</p>

      <p>Timothy M. Younger says that, rather than telling the truth, Garrett is simply trying to “mitigate his suspension.”</p>
      <p>Who’s telling the truth? Sadly, we may never know the real answer to that question.</p>
