      <h1>Fifty years later: Hobson heads back to court for Witness for the Prosecution</h1>

      <p>What a difference a decade or five can make.</p>
      <p>In 1970, I was an English and drama teacher at the newly opened Central Memorial High School and was directing musicals at the Jubilee Auditorium for Eileen Higgins’s Calgary Theatre Singers.</p>
      <p>My second musical for Higgins was My Fair Lady, which featured Maureen Thomas as the cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle, and Jack Goth as her wonderfully unorthodox father, Alfred P. Doolittle. Thomas and I were both novices to the Calgary community theatre scene but Goth was one of its most respected leaders who not only acted but directed and produced musicals, dramas and comedies. He had been a mainstay with Dr. Betty Mitchell’s Workshop 14 which morphed into Theatre Calgary in 1968.</p>
      <p>Directing Goth was not an easy task. He’d directed My Fair Lady several years earlier and we had some royal battles so it took me by surprise when he approached me at the final cast party to tell me he was creating a new community theatre called Workshop Theatre. He wanted me to direct its inaugural play, a production of Witness for the Prosecution, Agatha Christie’s masterpiece of suspense, intrigue and deception.</p>
      <p>It was an honour I didn’t take lightly. In fact, I actually needed to lighten up. In his review for the Calgary Herald, arts critic Jamie Portman observed that I had taken myself and Christie’s play far too seriously. He said I missed the humour in it.</p>
      <p>I was baffled. I thought Christie’s Witness for the Prosecution was high drama and, for years, argued the fact with anyone who’d listen. I would point out the audience response was so exuberant that we had to add performances.</p>
      <p>Fast forward 25 years, when the British TV acting duo Simon Oates and Pearl Ann Turner popped over to Calgary to tour their two-hander comedies. At that time, Valerie Pearson and I had found homes for our own company’s dinner theatres at The Glencoe Club, The Winter Club and the Elks Club.</p>
      <p>Oates and Turner approached me after one of my Glencoe plays to ask if I’d direct them in a summer production of Witness for the Prosecution at the Allied Arts Centre. We cast Wes Tritter as the prosecutor, Mr. Meyers, opposite Oates’s lawyer character, Sir Wilfred, who defends the murder suspect.</p>
      <p>It took just a few rehearsals of the courtroom scenes to finally understand what Portman had meant. Oates and Tritter not only saw but milked the humorous rivalry between the two lawyers. The audiences loved the show and we even had to hold it over.</p>
      <p>Here I am, another 25 years later, again directing Witness for the Prosecution to kickoff Workshop Theatre’s 50th anniversary season.  I’m blessed with a cast comprised of the city’s finest community theatre actors who’ve helped me not only find ample humour in this great old chestnut but the dark drama that I always knew was there and loved.</p>
      <p>In October, a revival of Witness for the Prosecution just entered its third year and is one of London’s hottest theatre tickets. I am looking forward to the day Vertigo Theatre’s artistic director Craig Hall will mount a dazzling production as only he knows how. Until then, I invite mystery theatre buffs to come along for a rather wild ride with us.</p>
      <p>Workshop Theatre’s Witness for the Prosecution, starring Rob Hay, Jen LeClare and Ray Dhaliwal, runs in the Pumphouse’s Victor Mitchell Theatre Nov. 22 to 30 at 7:30 p.m. with 2:30 p.m. matinees on Nov. 23 and 30.</p>
