        <b>Limerick hurler Paul Browne has confirmed his inter-county retirement.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bruff clubman was a member of the All Ireland-winning panel of 2018 but missed out on the final stage of that championship campaign due to injury.</p>
      <p>The midfielder won a pair of Munster hurling medals in 2013 and 2019, and added an Allianz Hurling League title to his haul earlier in 2019.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Browne says "the time is right to step away".</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank my club Bruff GAA, fellow club colleagues, coaches and mentors for their support", he added.</p>
      <p>"I hope to repay that support over the coming years. To the teachers and staff in Scoil Dean Cussen and FCJ Bruff I am extremely grateful for their encouragement in my younger years.</p>
      <p>Injuries have played a part in his decision with Browne saying, "Over the course of my playing career I went through several surgical procedures and I would like to thank the Limerick County Board and Senior Medical Team of Mark Van Drumpt, Mark Melbourne and Dr. James Ryan for the care I received.</p>
      <p>"I leave with nothing but wonderful memories and pride from my eleven years playing with Limerick. To have shared the dressing room with all my past team-mates and this incredible panel of players now has been the greatest honour of my life.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to supporting the 2020 panel and management and I would urge all Limerick supporters to do so. There are fantastic times ahead.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank my family and in particular my girlfriend Niamh for their unwavering support and sacrifice during my career."</p>
