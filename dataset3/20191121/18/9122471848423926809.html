      <h1>Tom Izzo Announces NCAA’s Ruling On Transfer Joey Hauser</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:44:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The third-ranked Michigan State Spartans have high aspirations for the 2019-20 season. But those aspirations will be more difficult to accomplish after Marquette transfer Joey Hauser will have to sit out the entire season.</p>
      <p>Hauser was hoping to be immediately eligible to play for Tom Izzo’s Spartans this season. But Izzo announced on Thursday that Hauser’s appeal to the NCAA has been denied.</p>
      <blockquote>“Joey did have a strong case,” Izzo said Thursday, via the <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2019/11/21/michigan-state-basketball-joey-hauser-eligibility-ncaa-appeal/4259356002/">Detroit Free Press</a>. “And I am devastated, if you want to know the truth.”</blockquote>

      <p>Hauser is a huge addition for the Spartans and was expected to make an immediate impact this season. The 6-foot-9 transfer from Marquette averaged 9.7 points per game to go along with 5.3 RPG as a freshman for the Golden Eagles last season. His noteworthy play earned him a selection to the All-Big East freshman team.</p>
      <p>The forward is already one of Michigan State’s best shooters on the team, <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/college/michigan-state/spartans/2019/11/21/michigan-state-basketball-joey-hauser-eligibility-ncaa-appeal/4259356002/">according to Izzo</a>. Hauser’s length and shooting abilities will certainly be missed this season.</p>
      <p>As for the Spartans, they’ve rattled off three straight wins since their season opening loss to Kentucky. One of those three straight victories came against No. 13 Seton Hall last Thursday.</p>
      <p>Michigan State gets back on the court next Monday against Virginia Tech in the Maui Invitational. The game will be televised on ESPN2.</p>
