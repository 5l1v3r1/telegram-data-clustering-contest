      <p>Each woman's body was found decomposed in Daytona Beach with gunshot wounds between late 2005 and early 2006, according to the station.</p>
      <p>Hayes is also suspected of killing a fourth woman, Stacey George, whose body was found in Daytona Beach in early 2008 (and likely killed in late 2007) under similar circumstances, <a href="https://www.wesh.com/article/suspected-daytona-beach-serial-killer-robert-hayes-indicted/29872719">WESH reported</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2016, investigators matched DNA recovered on two of the three Daytona Beach victims with DNA on another South Florida victim, Rachey Bey, to identify Hayes as a suspect, the <a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20191121/daytona-beach-serial-killing-suspect-robert-hayes-indicted-in-3-deaths">Daytona Beach News-Journal reported</a>.</p>
