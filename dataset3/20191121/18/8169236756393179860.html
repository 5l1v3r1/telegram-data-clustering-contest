        <b>Jose Mourinho is reported to have surprised some of his players on his first day as Tottenham manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician is back in Premier League management again after a spell away from the game since he was sacked by Manchester United last December.</p>

      <p>Shortly after the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino, Mourinho was announced as the new Spurs manager on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Known for being one of the game’s real characters, it’s fair to say the former Man Utd and Chelsea boss’ reputation has perhaps taken a turn for the worse after difficulties in his last few jobs.</p>
      <p>Things ended badly for him at Real Madrid, his second stint at Chelsea, and then at United last year, but it seems he’s taken people by surprise at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-have-no-plans-to-make-jose-mourinho-work-under-a-sporting-director-just-yet-a4292816.html?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574336008">Evening Standard</a>, the new manager surprised players by how engaging he was as he took the time to speak to every one of his new players individually, as well as giving a talk to the group as a whole.</p>
      <p>Spurs fans will now be hoping Mourinho can surprise them too, with his appointment in the place of the extremely popular Pochettino not initially going down too well.</p>
