      <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa has snubbed ailing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga in the change of street names across the country.<br/><br/><br/>Chiwenga, a former army general and liberation hero, helped Mnangagwa ascend to power in the 2017 coup that removed the late Robert Mugabe.<br/><br/>In an announcement of change of street names by Tourism Minister Nqobizitha Ndlovu, Chiwenga was a shock exclusion.<br/><br/>In Bulawayo 6th Avenue was changed to Emmerson Mnangagwa Avenue while Fife Street was named after Queen Lozikeyi while other streets were also changed and named after luminaries like Albert Nxele, John Nkomo and others. <br/><br/>Ndlovu said the name changes were meant to celebrate the country's heroes and notable personalities.<br/><br/>Zanu-PF insiders said Chiwenga's exclusion was confirmation of bad blood between the former army general and Mnangagwa. <br/>"With Chiwenga's contribution in the war and his role in the coup, it was expected that a street would be named after him but he was left out," said the source. <br/><br/>"It shows Mnangagwa snubs Chiwenga on street names. It shows you that things are bad between the two leaders."</p>
