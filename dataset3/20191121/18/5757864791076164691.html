      <h1>Rewind Time With This Blockbuster-Themed Party Game</h1>

      <p>With only <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/576279/one-blockbuster-store-left">one</a> Blockbuster location left in the world, the good old days of wandering video rental store aisles and getting chewed out for late fees are definitely a thing of the past—but like so many relics from the '90s, the pull of nostalgia has ensured that Blockbuster (or at least the brand) won't disappear for good. Now the video store is back in the form of a party game from <a href="https://bigpotato.com/">Big Potato Games</a> that is designed to test the movie knowledge of you and up to 11 friends.</p>
      <p>Marketing itself as “a movie game for anyone who has ever seen a movie,” the Blockbuster party game consists of two parts. In part one, players from each team compete head-to-head to name as many movies as they can that fit under specific categories (e.g., movies with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/552947/tom-cruise-running-means-movie-success-math">Tom</a> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66850/11-movies-could-have-starred-tom-cruise">Cruise</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73331/20-epic-facts-about-lord-rings-trilogy">famous</a> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/93918/which-movie-does-not-belong-each-trilogy">trilogies</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/65706/15-high-flying-facts-about-airplane">movies</a> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/71594/14-moving-facts-about-planes-trains-and-automobiles">with</a> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79399/14-slithery-facts-about-snakes-plane">planes</a>). In the second half, two teams face off against each other to test their skills at a game of movie-related charades. The catch? Players can only describe movies in one of three randomly chosen ways: acting out scenes, rattling off a famous quote, or describing the films with one word.</p>
      <p>The real selling point of the whole package is that Big Potato fit all the game cards and buzzer into a box that is virtually identical to the old-school Blockbuster VHS rental cases, right down to its distinct color scheme and shape. All it's missing is the membership card. </p>
      <p>The Blockbuster board game costs $26 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blockbuster-Party-Game-Ages-Plus/dp/B07RHFMHZ7/?tag=mf-art-smart-shopping-20">on Amazon</a> and $20 <a href="https://goto.target.com/AVoA7">at Target</a>. That’s a fair price for getting the chance to rewind time.</p>
