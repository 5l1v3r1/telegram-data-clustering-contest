      <h1>Do not pay any heed to propaganda</h1>
      <h2>PM urges people </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T18:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Unb, Dhaka</a></address>
      <p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has urged everyone not to pay heed to propaganda about shortage of onion and salt in the market.</p>
      <p>“We see confusion is being created carrying out propaganda. I would like to tell you all not to pay heed to such propaganda,” she said while addressing a reception at the Army Multipurpose Complex in Dhaka Cantonment.</p>
      <p>The premier hosted the reception for the family members and close relatives of the Bir Shresthas and other gallantry award-winning freedom fighters on the occasion of the Armed Forces Day 2019.</p>
      <p>Hasina said various types of propaganda was being spread suddenly as if there was no onion, salt or any other item (in the market) and thus efforts were made to confuse the people.</p>
      <p>“I know this would be done. It’s normal. We have to move on facing all these issues. Today, we are self-sufficient in food. Bangladesh is now a food-surplus country.”</p>
      <p>Mentioning that the production of fish and vegetables increased significantly, she said her government pays its due attention to food and nutrition.</p>
      <p>Talking about freedom fighters, the PM urged them to share the stories of the Liberation War with the new generation and local people so that they could know the history.</p>
      <p>“We’re a victorious nation. We achieved victory in the Liberation War. [share the stories of the war] so that our future generations can know how we became a victorious nation.... The Bangalees can never suffer any defeat.”</p>
      <p>Hasina said the government was trying to preserve the massacre spots of the Liberation War.</p>
      <p>She said Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman had engaged himself in rebuilding the war-ravaged country. He developed every force -- Army, Navy, Air Force, BGB, police and Ansar -- and made them fit for an independent country.</p>
      <p>Bangabandhu had realised the recognition of Bangladesh from 126 countries and many international agencies, including the United Nations, OIC and Commonwealth.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the Father of the Nation was killed when he was taking the country towards development with a GDP growth rate of over 7 percent, the PM said. “The man who made huge sacrifices for the country’s independence was killed so brutally.”</p>
      <p>A total of 101 family members of seven Bir Shresthas, gallantry award-winning freedom fighters, and their family members attended the function. The premier handed over cheques of honorarium to them.</p>
      <p>She also handed over “Shantikalin Padak 2018-2019” (peace medals) to 13 members of the armed forces -- eight from the Army, two from Navy and three from Air Force.</p>
      <p>Liberation War Affairs Minister AKM Mozammel Haque, PM’s Security Affairs Adviser Maj Gen (retd) Tarique Ahmed Siddique and the chiefs of the three services were present.</p>
