        <b>By Puja Mehra</b>
      </p>
      <p>RSS sarsanghchalak <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Mohan-Bhagwat">Mohan Bhagwat</a> made a significant admission in his annual speech on Vijay Dashami, the sangh’s founding day on October 8, “…forgetting the swadeshi consciousness while seeking answers to the pressures of the [economic] situation will also lead to loss… We are lagging behind in thinking about this ‘swa’ (self) even decades after attaining Independence.”</p>
      <p>Critics have long said that no coherent economic philosophy can be discerned from the current government’s policy. But this was the RSS chief conceding to the Right’s ideological edifice for guiding economic policy formulation being absent. More importantly, if RSS and BJP are still struggling with their economic thinking, then that leads to the question of which — if any, at all — political party represents the economic right on India’s ideological spectrum.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Make It Private</b>
      </p>
      <p>For long, India’s economy has leaned on government. A right-leaning policy approach would be a move towards a well-defined, but limited, role for the State to play in an economy driven by private enterprise. It’s hard to detect a bias in favour of a markets worldview in the politically right BJP government’s policy prescriptions.</p>
      <p>Rather, reluctance to give up economic controls and, in fact, a drive to reinstate controls that were dismantled in the post-1991 decades can be seen in many of its policies — from bailouts to keeping alive telecom dinosaurs BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd) and MTNL (Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd), to price controls on imported medical devices and formulations, and the stubborn refusal to privatise public sector banks (PSBs) fit for privatisation.</p>
      <p>The goods and services tax (GST) system has ended up replicating many of the complexities of the extant indirect tax system, even as jobs and rent-seeking opportunities for tax administration continues. State finance ministers primarily oversee indirect taxes. Therefore, they stand to lose the meatiest portion of their work allocation if GST were to become smooth and predictable. A simple GST would mean substantially whittled down clout for these politicians.</p>
      <p>Reminiscent of the penchant of planned economies for setting targets, BJP’s 2019 manifesto pledged to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025 and a$10 trillion economy by 2032. It promised Rs 100 lakh of investments in infrastructure by 2024. The budget committed the government to those targets.</p>
      <p>Manufacturers in Vietnam and China are able to make agarbattis at far more competitive prices, resulting in increased imports under the India-Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) free trade agreement (FTA).</p>
      <p>As Indian manufacturers began to hurt, the government’s instinctive reaction was to move raw agarbattis from the ‘free’ to the ‘restrictive’ category. This resulted in incense sticks attracting higher tariffs. India has also, at least for the time being, walked away from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).</p>
      <p>Wherever there is a problem, the standard response in government is to rely upon the policy tool of economic controls. Alternative options for policy action that may accomplish similar goals are not even considered. But the more government expands, the more markets shrink, and scarce administrative resources get spread more thinly.</p>
      <p>The recent clamour for tariff hikes and tax sops demonstrates that, not only politicians and bureaucrats, but also industry and voters don’t entirely reject the expanded role for governments wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No Strings is in Fashion</b>
      </p>
      <p>India’s move from a low-growth to a high-growth economy had happened because of economic reforms and liberalisation. What set India apart from many other growth accelerations, particularly in Asia — as former chief economic adviser Arvind Virmani wrote in an International Monetary Fund (IMF) working paper — is the role played by domestic entrepreneurs and the minimal direct role played by the government, especially post-1991.</p>
      <p>The government’s role in accelerating growth was to lift controls and restriction on entrepreneurs, and give them greater freedom to operate. This contrasts with South Korea and Taiwan, where the State played a much more active role in accelerating growth. In Singapore, foreign direct investment (FDI) was important, although the State continued to play a critical role. China relied on the communist party and the State.</p>
      <p>Ideally, the Indian State should have shifted focus to expanding its role in providing public goods and service, particularly public good infrastructure.</p>
      <p>But it has fallen considerably short of that compared to the fast-growing economies in Asia and elsewhere. The thinking capacity needed for evolving an economic framework, and coming up with proposals, agendas and roadmaps catering to the needs of an economy as large and complex as India is considerable. Unwittingly, Mohan Bhagwat hit the nail on its head on Dussehra while bemoaning ‘swadeshi consciousness’ being forgotten.</p>
      <p>The trouble with BJP, as well as RSS, seems to be the absence of a proper economic cell. The thinking vacuum precludes the thrashing out of a model. Swadeshi Jagaran Manch (SJM), an affiliate of RSS, claims to speak for India’s economic right, but advocates a ‘strong rupee’, not a markets-determined rupee-dollar exchange rate. Surely, it can’t be seriously considered the torchbearer for right-wing, conservative economics.</p>
      <p>Other than rejecting technically trained pro-markets economists and their ideas, India’s political right and its affiliates have no clear idea of what an Indian pro-markets model for economic progress can be.</p>
