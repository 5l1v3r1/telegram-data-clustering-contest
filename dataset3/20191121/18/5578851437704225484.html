        <b>Speaking at an event titled “The Role of NATO in the Afghan Peace Process” hosted by the Afghanistan Institute of Strategic Studies (AISS) in Kabul, NATO’s Senior Civilian Representative Nicholas Kay said“until there is a complete peace agreement” there will be “no comprehensive withdrawal” and a “comprehensive peace agreement would be the product of the Intra-Afghan negotiation.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kay says the Taliban will not win the Afghan war as Afghan defense and security forces have become more capable with the NATO support and the people also don’t want to back to the past dark days.</p>
      <p>“The Taliban will not win, it is as simple as that. The Taliban will not win on the battlefield because the ANDSF are increasingly strong and capable, and they are increasingly strong and capable because of the training, advice, assisting and funding they get from NATO,” said Kay.</p>
      <p>At the same time, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg hopes that the Afghan war will end politically.</p>
      <p>“We welcome the release of the two professors at the American University in Kabul that have been held in captivity by Taliban for some time. We also commend President Ghani for his bold decision that made this possible. These are confidence-building measures. Hopefully they can move us closer to resumption of the peace talks and therefore also lay the grounds for a political, negotiated solution to the conflict, the crisis, in Afghanistan,” said Stoltenberg.</p>
      <p>In less than two weeks, NATO leaders are expected to discuss the Afghan peace and stability process in London.</p>
