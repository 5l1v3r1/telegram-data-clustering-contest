      <p>As part of its dengue prevention campaigns, the Salem Corporation affixed smiley stickers on the premises as a recognition for maintaining hygiene and preventing mosquito breeding.</p>
      <p>Corporation Commissioner R.Sadheesh launched the programme along with City Health Officer K. Parthibhan at R.D. Paul Street near Sooramangalam here on Thursday. Mr. Sadheesh affixed smiley stickers on residences where the premises were found to be clean and appreciated the residents. He also pasted annual calendars on the doors of the residences as part of Corporationâ€™s plan to ensure regular monitoring.</p>
      <p>According to Corporation officials, the calendar has 52 numbered boxes referring to 52 weeks a year and each box has a Yes/No and designated space for signature in it. Field workers appointed for dengue prevention would visit the residence every week and check for presence of mosquito larvae. Workers would make necessary markings in the box and sign. Senior officials would monitor these activities and conduct necessary checks.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sadheesh later conducted inspections in the area and advised public to store water in a hygienic manner. Public were also advised by officials to discard unnecessary plastic and other items. Officials also urged the public to let field workers coming with proper identity cards to conduct necessary inspections in the residences.</p>
