      <p>Back in October, we asked for your questions for Euronews space correspondent and European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut Luca Parmitano. More than a hundred of you sent them in, from all around the internet – Facebook to Twitter, Instagram to Reddit.</p>

      <p>They ranged from the sublime – Juliette, aged 10, asked which of your five senses do you use the most in space – to the ridiculous: “How do you fart in space?”</p>
      <p>Luca has chosen his favourites and will be answering in a weekly series called Ask Our Astronaut.</p>
      <p>First up, a question from France. High school tutor Maarten Das asked: “How can space exploration and science in space help us to find solutions for climate change on Earth?”</p>
      <p>Luca gives us his unique insights into climate change, after witnessing it from an astronaut’s perspective, and talks about what kind of solutions could be found to fight it.</p>
      <p>In the next episode, Luca will tell us all about what frightens an astronaut the most.</p>
