      <h1>Former RBI Governor Rangarajan Says $5-Trillion GDP Target Simply Out Of Question</h1>

      <p>Stating that the economy is in bad shape, former Reserve Bank governor C Rangarajan has said at the current growth rate, reaching the $5-trillion gross domestic product target by 2025 is “simply out of question”.</p>
      <p>The Modi government soon after assuming office for the second term has set a target of taking the economy to $5 trillion over the next five years. But since there have been dark clouds gathering all over the economy leading many to question the maintainability of the target.</p>
      <p>The economy has been on steady decline with growth rate slowing from 8.2 percent in the fiscal year 2016 to 6.8 percent FY19.</p>
      <p>While the first-quarter growth slipped to a <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/india-gdp-growth-crashes-to-six-year-low-of-5-in-april-june-quarter">six-year low</a> of 5 percent, the best forecast for the second quarter is 4.3 percent now. Even Reserve Bank of India has lowered its growth full-year forecast by a full 90 basis points in two months to 6.1 percent in its October policy review.</p>
      <p>“Today our economy is about $2.7 trillion and we are talking about doubling this over the next five years at $5 trillion. The required rate of growth to achieve that level is in excess of 9 percent per annum. Reaching $5 trillion by 2025 is simply out of question,” Rangarajan said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“You have lost two years. This year it is going to be under-6 percent growth and next year it may be about 7 percent. Thereafter the economy may pick up,” he said while addressing a function organised by IBS-ICFAI Business School.</p>
      <p>He also said if at all the GDP becomes a $5-trillion gorilla, our per capita income will go up to $3,600 from the present $1,800, leaving us still in the low-middle income country bracket.</p>
      <p>“The definition of a developed country is the one whose per capita income is $12,000. It will take 22 years for us to reach that level provided we grow at 9 percent per annum,” the former central banker said.</p>
