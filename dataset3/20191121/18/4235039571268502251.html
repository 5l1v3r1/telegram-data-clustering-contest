      <p><b>Apple</b> announced that it has begun construction of a new production and administration complex in Austin, <b>Texas</b>, Reuters reported. At a production facility just a short distance away, <b>Apple</b> is preparing to ship the all-new Mac Pro to customers starting in December the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Building the Mac Pro, <b>Apple</b>’s most powerful device ever, in Austin is both a point of pride and a testament to the enduring power of American ingenuity,” said Tim Cook, <b>Apple</b>’s CEO. “With the construction of our new campus in Austin now underway, <b>Apple</b> is deepening our close bond with the city and the talented and diverse workforce that calls it home. Responsible for 2.4 million American jobs and counting, <b>Apple</b> is eager to write our next chapter here and to keep contributing to America’s innovation story.”</p>
      <p>This announcement came on the same day President Donald Trump was touring an <b>Apple</b> production <b>plant</b> that is manufacturing new Mac Pro computers.</p>
      <p>The company has been criticized by Trump for producing most of its products in China. However, Cook and Trump have established a good relationship. In 2017, Trump said Cook had promised him "three big plants," BTA recalls.</p>
      <p>The new $ 1 billion, 3 million-square-foot manufacturing facility will initially welcome 5,000 employees and expand its capacity to 15,000 and is expected to open in 2022, <b>Apple</b> said. </p>
      <p>Austin is one of the fastest growing American cities with a population of about 1 million people. The University of <b>Texas</b> and other technology companies are located it the state, including Dell Technologies.</p>
      <p>Austin currently employs about 7,000 people for Apple.</p>
      <p><b>Apple</b> also continues its expansion in Boulder, Culver City, New York, Pittsburgh, San Diego and Seattle, it said in the statement.</p>
