      <h1>2017 World Series Wikipedia Page Got An Appropriate Edit To Troll The Houston Astros (PIC)</h1>

      <p>With every passing day, there seems to be even more uncovered cheating that the Houston Astros engaged in, especially during the 2017 season where they won the World Series.</p>
      <p>It seems obvious at this point that the team cheated, so we should expect a punishment who draft picks taken away, fines, suspensions, etc.</p>
      <p>Until that happens, the team and the fan base has to deal with non-stop slander and jokes, which has taken someone to the Wikipedia page for the 2017 World Series and giving it a savage update.</p>

      <p>The World Series MVP is now listed as the “Centerfield cameraman (Houston).”</p>
      <p>It was Astros outfielder George Springer who was awarded MVP honors after the Astros defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games.</p>
