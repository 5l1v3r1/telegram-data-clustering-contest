      <p>If something seems too good to be true, it's probably because it is.</p>
      <p>President Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1194824072011698176">congratulated his eldest child</a> last week for hitting the top of <i>The</i> <i>New York </i><i>Times' </i>bestseller list with his book <i>Triggered</i>. But <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878427/donald-trump-jr-debuts-no-1-bestseller-list--but-theres-catch">as was pointed out at the time</a>, Donald Trump Jr.'s rise to the top of the list was in part due to an unknown number of bulk sale purchases — leading some people to believe he bought his way into the ranks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/1197599033503756288">As <i>Times</i> reporter Nick Confessore</a> noted Thursday, Trump Jr.'s book <i>did</i> in fact get a pretty hefty sales boost — from the Republican National Committee. A Federal Election Commission disclosure reportedly shows the RNC made an expenditure to Books-a-Million totaling $94,800 one week before <i>Triggered</i> was released. The disbursement, which was identified as being for "donor mementos," was reportedly connected to the promotion of Trump Jr.'s book.</p>

      <p>Books-a-Million, which<a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191031005759/en/Books-A-Million-Host-Donald-Trump-Jr.-Author-Event"> held a fundraiser at the beginning of the month</a> for <i>Triggered</i>, is listing copies of the book for $23.09 online, which comes out to a little over 4,000 copies given the RNC's payment.</p>
      <p>An RNC spokesperson previously told Confessore the committee had "not made a large bulk purchase" but was ordering copies of <i>Triggered</i> in order to "keep up with demand."</p>
      <p>As Confessore points out, the situation is a <a href="https://twitter.com/nickconfessore/status/1197601640884396032">sweet deal for both the RNC and Trump Jr</a>. One makes $500,000 off of promotional deals with donors, and the other becomes a <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author.</p>
