      <p>When Kate questioned how many grandchildren she had, Caitlyn said: "20 in December."</p>

      <p>The emotional chat started when Kate remarked that the parents were all a range of ages.</p>
      <p>Kate joked she was officially geriatric being at mum at 38, while Jacqueline became a mum at the age of 22.</p>
      <p>Kate said: "When you are younger, you might feel like you know what you’re doing but actually you feel like that when you’re older. Do you remember holding that little bundle and feeling the pressure that you’re entirely responsible."</p>

      <p>Caitlyn then asked: "Does anyone remember the first time something came out of your mouth that you’re Mother said to you?"</p>
      <p>After everyone laughed, Caitlyn continued: "It’s so scary when you become your parents."</p>
      <p>Adele joked she always tells her nieces and nephews that money doesn't grow on trees, then Caitlyn added: "My daughter Kendall’s response is ‘yes it does, its paper’."</p>
