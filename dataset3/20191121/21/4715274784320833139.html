      <p>Tacloban City—The Department of Public Works and Highways has started the construction of the P50 million worth farm-to-market road projects in various villages in central Leyte.</p>
      <p>Of the nine FMR road projects, seven are ongoing and two have yet to start, Gerald Pacanan, Public Works Leyte 2nd district office chief said.</p>
      <p>Among the ongoing projects are in Cabariwan village in Dagami town; Hibunawon and Sagcahan both in Jaro town; and roads linking Lima to Socsocon, Arabunog to Cancaraja, and Manabanay to Sapsap in Pastrana town.</p>
      <p>The construction of these projects started in the last week of September and early October this year. The target completion is early next year.</p>
      <p>“These projects are expected to help increase agricultural productivity in the area and provide residents better access to basic social services such as health and education,” Pacanan said.</p>
      <p>He said this development will benefit all commuters by providing them smooth and convenient transport from farming communities to commercial centers. </p>
