      <p>A training <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/two-airmen-killed-in-mishap-involving-two-planes-at-air-force-base-in-oklahoma/">accident</a> involving two jets at Vance Air Force Base in Enid, Oklahoma, took the lives of two airmen on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The two T-38 Talons were involved in what officials referred to as a "training mishap" early Thursday morning that left one plane in the grass near the AFB runway and another upside down in the dirt. The identities of the deceased airmen were not released pending notification of their families. Details about the cause of the accident were not immediately clear.</p>
      <p>"We are saddened by the tragic news of the loss of life of two pilots at Vance Air Force Base this morning. My thoughts and prayers are with the pilots’ families and the team at Vance,” said Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. "Today serves as a reminder that our nation’s military make great sacrifices and put their lives on the line everyday to protect our nation. I spoke with the Wing Commander at Vance AFB to communicate the state will offer support in any possible way during this time."</p>
      <p>A training accident at Fort Stewart-Hunter <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/3-soldiers-killed-3-injured-in-training-accident-in-georgia">Army Airfield in Georgia</a> claimed the lives of three soldiers when a Bradley Fighting Vehicle they were operating was involved in an accident. "Today is a heartbreaking day for the 3rd Infantry Division, and the entire Fort Stewart-Hunter Army Airfield community,” Maj. Gen. Tony Aguto said at the time. “We are extremely saddened by the loss of three Dogface Soldiers, and injuries to three more. Our hearts and prayers go out to all the families affected by this tragedy."</p>
