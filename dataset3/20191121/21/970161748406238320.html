      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> woke up in tears in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle as the realisation sunk in of being far away from home.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two got a little bit teary on tonight’s show as she revealed in the bush telegraph that she was missing home.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘I just woke up feeling a bit like “mmmm” when you’re just looking up at pure Jungle and you think ‘wow, I’m so far away from home’.</p>
      <p>‘The thing is, everyone is missing their families, I just feel like it’s too soon to be crying missing your family…and we all smell so bad, we just stink, I stink, the smelliest I’ve ever been in my life.’</p>
      <p>Ian Wright sat next to Jacqueline and comforted her as she was crying, he reassured her and said it would be ok and she won’t always be away from her family.</p>

      </p>
      <p>He even claimed that she might walk from the ITV show before the first half of the series.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline is going to find it really difficult being away from home, she’ll feel incredibly homesick,’ he told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</p>
      <p>‘I’m seeing that she may try to walk out of the jungle in the first half of the series, hopefully the team’s morale and friendships will convince her to stay.’</p>

      <p>Chris goes on to explain that he feels the mum-of-two will be an easy target for the bushtucker trials and that the public will vote for her to do them regularly.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I’m seeing that Jacqueline will be a trial favourite.</p>

      <p>‘The public will vote both her and another female into many of the early trials, a result which will help Jacqueline’s personality to shine through.</p>
      <p>‘I’m seeing that Jacqueline has fears, as we all do, although some are quite strong, possibly leading her to experience a panic attack and subsequently pull out of her first or second trial.’</p>
