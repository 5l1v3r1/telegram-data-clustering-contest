      <h1>3 Teams On “Upset Alert” In Week 13</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:32:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Week 13 of the college football regular season is underway. This weekend, there are a number of important matchups on the horizon.</p>
      <p>We’ve already seen a few big upsets this season (Kansas State over Oklahoma, South Carolina over Georgia, etc.) and if we know one thing about college sports, more could be on the way. If any happen this weekend, they could have major ramifications this late in the game.</p>
      <p>Heading into Week 13, we’re putting three teams on “Upset Alert.” All are up against unranked, but dangerous, conference opponents.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look.</p>
