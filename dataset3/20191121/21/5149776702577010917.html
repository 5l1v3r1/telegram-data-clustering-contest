      <h1>Meet the 'Police Officer of the Year' who hunts down wanted criminals in his spare time</h1>
      <h2>PC James Gill found a man hiding in loft insulation - and wins over criminals' ex partners' with 'an axe to grind'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:55:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:55</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>A Nottinghamshire police officer who hunts down wanted criminals in his spare time has been crowned 'Officer of the Year.'</p>
      <p>PC James Gill, 37, was astonished that more than 40 criminals were still on the loose in the city for crimes including drug dealing, burglary and assault.</p>
      <p>Based in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Arnold</a>, the constable decided that between responding to 999 calls he would set up a 'Wanted Squad' with a colleague, hunting down those who tried to evade the law.</p>
      <p>Since April, the team have managed to reduce the amount of wanted criminals from 42 to 16.</p>

      <p>PC Gill found one crook hiding in an attic crawlspace wrapped in loft insulation while another was hiding out at a Calverton caravan park.</p>
      <p>He said disgruntled ex-partners with "an axe to grind" helped him weed out a few, while known associates were happy to hand out information to "get us off their backs."</p>
      <p>PC Gill, a regular on reality television show <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/">Bodycam Squad</a>, told Nottinghamshire Live: "We identified there were people slipping through the net and extra work that could be done around catching people who were longterm wanted.</p>
      <p>"There were various offenders - some had failed to attend court for criminal damage, assault, burglary and drug dealing. There was a drug dealer that had been outstanding since 2017.</p>
      <p>"Attempts to locate him had come to a grounding halt so we needed different tactics to locate these offenders.</p>
      <p>"Any free moments around 999 calls and ongoing investigations we were knocking on doors. We concentrated on places of work and family members.</p>
      <p>"Ex partners are the best ones - the disgruntled ones have got an axe to grind and they are happy to give up information.</p>
      <p>"If you make it a problem for some of their associates, and are seen buzzing around their patch, it makes it in their best interest to give up information to get us off their backs."</p>
      <p>For the drug dealer on the loose, police had built up intelligence that his daughter was at his mum's address - and that he would visit on weekends.</p>

      <p>They swooped in on the address in the early hours of the morning and arrested him.</p>
      <p>In another incident, police surrounded a caravan in Calverton making it difficult for the offender to try and outrun them.</p>
      <p>"Some of the strangest places were in an attic conversion," he added. "A crawlspace you would not think a human being would fit in.</p>
      <p>"He was hiding and covered in loft insulation. He was wanted for carrying knives.</p>
      <p>"Another sat on the loft hatch so we could not lift it but we knew he was up there," he added. "It took some strong work between us to move him.</p>
      <p>"People will do anything to escape but we don't want to give them that opportunity."</p>
      <p>He said in most cases criminals become wanted when they fail to attend their court appearance.</p>
      <p>Some are found within six hours, but others will go into hiding for years.</p>
      <p>"We are hunting one now that has been on the run since 2008.</p>
      <p>"He is known as 'The Running Man'. We know he has changed his appearance and lives in an area where people do not know him and an assumed identity.</p>
      <p>"He is laughing at the police so we are doing everything to find him."</p>
      <p>He said creating the team is one of his "proudest achievements".</p>
      <p>"It's making these people know their time on the run is over," he added.</p>
      <p>PC Gill, who has worked in the city for nearly 10 years, was one of many officers awarded at the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/crime">Nottinghamshire Police Awards</a> held at Albert Hall on Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>He was crowned Nottinghamshire's Police Officer of the Year.</p>
      <p>Other awards were handed out for bravery, saving people's lives and making significant arrests.</p>
      <p>Speaking about his award, PC Gill said: "Policing is not an individual activity, it is a team.</p>
      <p>"It is because I have been surrounded by good, experienced and motivated officers we have achieved what we have. It is not a solo achievement."</p>

      <p>Neighbourhood Policing Inspector for Gedling Chris Pearson said: "PC Gill is a real role model for the local community.</p>
      <p>"His work has allowed him to locate suspects and that work has been nothing short of relentless and he has been responsible for arresting many people for outstanding offences.</p>
      <p>"I am aware that in just over two months PC Gill along with his colleagues at Gedling have been responsible for arresting a large number of people that had been outstanding for offences or had failed to attend court."</p>
