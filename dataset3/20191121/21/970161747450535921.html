        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/avengers/">Avengers</a> star Chris Hemsworth and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a> star Rupert Grint were spotted jetting in to the same airport.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The duo arrived separately at Narita International Airport in Tokyo, with Chris attending Comic-Con and Rupert being there for a possible film</p>
      <p>Rupert, 31, went for an undercover look as he walked through the terminal in an all-black outfit, long black coat, and black sunglasses.</p>
      <p>He made the look a little more easy-going by adding a dark brown baseball cap.</p>
      <p>Chris, who is Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, opted for a casual ensemble as he walked by throwing peace signs for the cameras.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old donned a loose white t-shirt and black sweat pants to make sure he is comfortable enough for travel.</p>
      <p>Chris was followed by his large entourage which includes his personal trainer Luke Zocchi.</p>
      <p>Before arriving in Japan, Chris had been pictured multiple times just enjoying the beach in his homeland Australia.</p>
