      <h1>The Old Man And The See</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:12:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/rabbi-reuven-chaim-klein/" target="_blank">Rabbi Reuven Chaim Klein</a></address>
      <p>“<i>Zaken</i>,” “<i>seivah</i>,” “<i>yashish</i>,” “<i>kashish</i>,” “<i>yashan</i>,” and “<i>atik</i>” all mean old. <i>Pirkei Avos</i> (5:24) states that a person becomes a <i>zaken </i>at 60 and reaches <i>seivah </i>at 70. Based on this <i>mishnah</i>, <b>Rabbi Avraham Bedersi HaPenini</b> (1230-1300) argues that “<i>seivah</i>” describes someone older than a “<i>zaken</i>” (see also I Samuel 12:2 and Isaiah 46:4).</p>
      <p>Interestingly, <b>Rabbi Eliezer Reines</b> writes in <i>Maftechot HaDamesek </i>that “<i>seivah” </i>is a contraction of “<i>seva yamim</i>” (satisfied with days), which refers to the age of 70 (see Rashi and Bartenuro to <i>Avos</i>).</p>
      <p>The <b>Radak</b> in <i>Sefer HaShorashim </i>cites Job 15:11, which places “<i>yashish</i>” after “<i>seivah</i>,” leading him to conclude that “<i>yashish</i>” indicates a more advanced age than “<i>seivah</i>.” He accounts for the etymology of <i>yashish </i>by explaining that such a person has existed (“<i>yesh</i>”) for a very long time. Interestingly, “<i>yashish</i>” only appears four times in the Bible – all in the Book of Job.</p>
      <p>The <b>Targum</b> translates “<i>yashish</i>” as “<i>kashish</i>.” The only etymological explanation I can find connecting these two words is an unlikely idea proposed by <b>Rabbi Mordechai Tzvi Herzka</b> in <i>Divrei Chachamim</i>. He suggests that <i>aleph</i>,<i> yud</i>, and<i> kuf</i> are interchangeable because, in <i>gematria</i>, they represent the first number in the ones, tens, and hundreds, respectively. Thus, he explains that the <i>yud</i> of “<i>yashish</i>” in Hebrew morphs into the <i>kuf</i> of “<i>kashish</i>” in Aramaic.</p>
      <p>(<b>Rabbi Yehuda Leib Shapira-Frankfurter</b> [1743-1826] writes in <i>HaRekhasim LeVikah </i>that “<i>zaken</i>” is used for people and animals, while “<i>yashan</i>” is used for plants and other flora.)</p>
      <p>The Targumim tend to translate “<i>zaken</i>” as either “<i>kashish</i>” or “<i>sav</i>.” “<i>Sav</i>” is related to the Hebrew word “<i>seivah</i>,” and both these words form the basis of “<i>saba</i>,” which means “old man” or “grandfather.”</p>
      <p>Another word for old is “<i>atik</i>.” The root <i>ayin-tav-kuf</i> in the Bible primarily refers to movement in terms of space (“<i>vayaatek</i>” – see Genesis 12:8 and 26:22). “<i>Atik</i>” is also used to refer to babies who are “weaned” away from nursing (Isaiah 28:9). In later usage, the root came to mean “copy” or “transcribe,” as though one took the information from one document and “moved” it to another.</p>
      <p>“<i>Atik</i>” can also, though, refer to something far “removed” in time, i.e., ancient. Daniel refers to G-d as “<i>Atik Yomin</i> – Ancient of Days” (Daniel 7:9-22). (I used to think that the English word “antique” is a corruption of “<i>atik</i>,” but <b>Rabbi Shaul Goldman</b> told me that linguists parse the word differently: <i>Anti-que</i> is comprised of the prefix <i>ant </i>[“front” or “before”] and <i>uque </i>or <i>okw</i> [“to see”] in the so-called Proto-Indo-European language.)</p>
      <p>Another possibly-related word is “<i>vatik</i>.” It is found in the Talmud in the form of “<i>talmid vatik</i>,” which is a veteran disciple or experienced student. The famous poem <i>Yedid Nefesh</i>, ascribed to Rabbi Elazar Azikri (1533-1600), refers to G-d as “<i>vatik</i>,” which one might connect with Him being called “<i>atik</i>.” We also know that men who rise early to pray at the earliest possible time are called <i>vatikin</i>.</p>
      <p>In all of these cases, one might be tempted to say that “<i>vatik</i>” refers to being old, or at least an older-timer. However, there is a more plausible explanation: Ernest Klein writes in his etymological dictionary that “<i>vatik</i>” is related to the Arabic word “<i>wathuqa</i>” (firm, solid), as one achieves seniority and distinction by acting dependably and reliably. Accordingly, “<i>vatik</i>” actually refers to dependability/seniority in a specific position and not to any specific age.</p>
      <p>A popular folk etymology connects “<i>vatikin</i>” to the Vatican as its leaders also claim to be dependable and reliable. Nonetheless, serious linguists reject this etymology and explain that Vatican is actually derived from the Latin words <i>vates </i>(“soothsayer” or “prophet”) and <i>cano </i>(“sing” or “chant”), and refers to that site previously housing a pagan oracle before it became the center of Christianity.</p>

        <b>Insights from Rabbi Pappenheim</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rabbi Shlomo Pappenheim of Breslau</b> (1740-1814) traces “<i>zaken</i>” to the root <i>zayin-kuf</i>, which refers to the decomposition of physical items and the discharging of their core components. To this effect, he notes that “<i>mezukak</i>” (Psalms 12:7) refers to refined/unadulterated metal that was melted down in order to expel its impurities, “<i>zikim</i>” (Proverbs 26:18) are projectiles ejected from a launcher, and “<i>zikot</i>” (Isaiah 50:11) are rays of light emanating from the sun. Accordingly, “<i>zaken</i>” refers to old age typified by the breaking down of one’s physical form (or a wise man whose wholly spiritual/intellectual endeavors have made his physical faculties almost obsolete).</p>
      <p>Rabbi Pappenheim traces “<i>yashan</i>” to the root <i>shin-nun</i>, which connotes doubling. “<i>Shnei</i>” (two) is derived from this root, thus “<i>mishneh l’melech</i>” (second in command) and “<i>shein</i>” (a tooth – since people grow <i>two </i>sets of teeth: one as a baby and one as a child. Related words are “<i>hishanot</i>” (repetition), “<i>sheinah</i>” (sleep – since the brain rehashes its thoughts during sleep), and “<i>shanah</i>” (year – determined by the sun reaching the same spot as it did before. A <i>yashan </i>is one who has experienced many years.</p>
      <p>The root of “<i>yashish</i>” is <i>yud-shin</i>, which means has, is, or exists. “<i>Ish</i>” (man) is derived from this root because a man – i.e., a mature adult – has everything he needs to be successful in life and stands at the pinnacle of his personal existence. “<i>Yashish</i>,” thus, is a man who has remained in the state of adulthood for a long time and is now on the cusp of old age.</p>
      <p>Finally, <i>seivah</i>’s root is <i>samech-bet</i>, denoting a circular formation, giving way to words like “<i>sivuv</i>” (encircle), “<i>mesibah</i>” (party, where people sit around a table or guest of honor), and “<i>soveh</i>” (drunkard, who circles the streets looking for his next drink). “<i>Seivah</i>” denotes a person who is nearing the completion of his “circle of life.”</p>
