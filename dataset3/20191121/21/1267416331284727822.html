      <p>High schools students in Ontario will now be required to<a href="https://news.ontario.ca/edu/en/2019/11/ontario-brings-learning-into-the-digital-age.html?utm_source=ondemand&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=m"> take two online courses</a> instead of four, which was the previous planned number.</p>
      <p>This new regulation comes following an announcement from Ontario Minister of Education, Stephen Lecce.</p>
      <p>The Ford government previously proposed requiring high school students to complete four courses online. Lecce says the government has backtracked to demonstrate that it is being reasonable.</p>
      <p>This change is meant to “turn Ontario into a global leader of modern and digital education,” according to a government <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/edu/en/2019/11/ontario-brings-learning-into-the-digital-age.html?utm_source=ondemand&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=m">press release.</a></p>
      <p>Beginning September 2020, the mandatory online classes will start to be counted towards graduation requirements for high school students. This means that students who graduate in 2023-2024 will be the first cohort that are required to complete online courses.</p>
      <p>“The world is changing rapidly, and our students need the ability to learn and thrive in a world increasingly disrupted by technology,” said Lecce in the press release.</p>
      <p>Lecce says that online courses offer students with additional course options and more flexibility in terms of their schedule.</p>
