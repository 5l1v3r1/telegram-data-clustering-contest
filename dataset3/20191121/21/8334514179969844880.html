      <p>VALLETTA (Reuters) - Yorgen Fenech, a prominent businessman arrested on Wednesday in connection with investigations into the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, was released on bail on Thursday evening, police sources said.</p>
      <p>Police granted him bail as investigations continue and he will be under round-the-clock police surveillance.</p>
      <p>Fenech was arrested on board a yacht shortly after it left Portomaso marina early on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>A day earlier, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat offered to pardon a suspected middleman in the murder if he provided legally binding evidence of who was behind the killing.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Thursday Muscat said that so far the suspected middleman had not given complete information.</p>
      <p>Under Maltese law, the police had until early Friday morning to either charge or release Fenech.</p>
