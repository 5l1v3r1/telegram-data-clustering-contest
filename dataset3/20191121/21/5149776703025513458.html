      <p>The Scotland international is reportedly attracting the interest of several clubs ahead of the transfer window reopening in the new year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4935824/lawrence-shankland-nottingham-forest-dundee-united-transfer-news/">The Sun</a> reports that Sabri Lamouchi is looking to add another striker in January, but Forest will need to overcome interest from Celtic and Rangers if they are the land the forward.</p>

      <p>But according to <a href="https://tbrfootball.com/burnley-unlikely-to-make-renewed-kalvin-phillips-approach-according-to-report/">reports</a> on Thursday morning, the Clarets are unlikely to make another move for the Whites star.</p>

        <b>Huddersfield eye Non-League star</b>
      </p>
      <p>Huddersfield have been linked with a move for Torquay forward Jamie Reid.</p>
      <p>The striker has scored 15-goals in the National League so far this season, and also netted 29 goals in the National League South last season.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.skysports.com/transfer-centre">Sky Sports</a> are reporting that the forward’s impressive form has alerted the attention of Hudds boss Danny Cowley.</p>
