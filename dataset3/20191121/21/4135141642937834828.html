      <p>For the ninth time in school history, St. Mary’s Springs has been crowned state champions in football.</p>
      <p>The Ledgers defense dominated Regis on Thursday afternoon, holding the Ramblers to 2.8 yards per play en route to a hard-fought 7-0 win.</p>
      <p>Senior running back Marcus Orlandoni led St. Mary’s Springs with 20 carries for 75 yards and a touchdown. David Mueller added 14 carries for 57 yards, a 4.1 average.</p>
      <p>To clinch the state title, the Ledgers recovered a Gus Theisen fumble with under two minutes to play and ran out the clock from there.</p>
      <p>St. Mary’s Springs set the tone with a 10-minute drive to start the game, capped off by a 1-yard rush for a score by Orlandoni. The Ledgers out-gained Regis 167-134.</p>
      <p>It was the Ledgers’ third straight state championship. Last year, the Ledgers defeated Stratford 20-17. And in 2017, St. Mary’s Springs topped Iola-Scandinavia 35-12 at Camp Randall Stadium.</p>
