      <p>Harry Styles eloquently avoided an awkward question during a recent interview.</p>
      <p>While speaking on Australia’s KIIS, Styles was asked about his romantic life.</p>
      <p>“When I think of you I think you’re like Vinnie from ‘Entourage’, Vinnie Chase, you’ve got a couple of friends around, you’re doing your thing there’s women rolling in and out,” the co-presenter Kyle Sandilands said. “Is that what your life is like? Or is it a lot more normal than we think?”</p>
      <p>“I like to split the two terms of working and not working,” the “Watermelon Sugar” singer responded.</p>

      <p>“I’m definitely aware my working life can be extraordinary at times and isn’t the average thing, but I’d say my personal life is pretty normal,” he added.</p>
      <p>The answer wasn’t enough for Sandilands who pressed on. “I thought there’d be models and girls fighting [over you], and you’d be like, ‘ladies please, one at a time.’ It feels like such a waste.”</p>
      <p>“No, I just don’t do that, I’m sorry,” Styles politely, but firmly said while putting an end to the conservation.</p>
      <p>And sure enough, Styles’ fan came to his defence calling out the radio host for making the singer into a “womanizer.”</p>
