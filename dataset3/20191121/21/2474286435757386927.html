      <p>The state's water regulator is helping preserve the dwindling water supply in the Barwon River upstream of Mungindi Weir as well as providing equity of access to water users.</p>
      <p>With water in that section of the river down to a remnant pool, ensuring it lasts as long as possible must be a priority, a Natural Resources Access Regulator (NRAR) spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Director regional water regulation (West-Murray Darling) Graeme White said an order for a temporary water restriction on domestic water take from the junction of the Little Weir River and Barwon River, to Mungindi Weir was put in place by the NSW Government on October 30 to protect town water supplies in Mungindi.</p>
      <p>"NRAR officers are in the area now, monitoring compliance with the restriction," Mr White said.</p>
      <p>"Affected landholders have been sent a letter informing them of the temporary restriction and NRAR's presence.</p>
      <p>"With the state struggling through one of the worst droughts on record, we are taking proactive action to ensure equitable access for water users in Mungindi, regardless of whether they are on town water, have a stock and domestic licence or take water under basic landholder rights."</p>
      <p>The order under section 324 of the <i>Water Management Act 2000</i> restricts the take of water under basic landholder rights and domestic and stock access licences, to the same level of <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6479638/level-four-water-restrictions-for-boggabilla-mungindi-and-weemelah/">restrictions as the township of Mungindi - currently on level four water restrictions</a>.</p>
      <p>The order will apply to about 40 landholders with access to that section of the river.</p>
      <p>Moree Plains Shire Council water services manager Roland Heatley said the council was supportive of NRAR's activities in the area.</p>
      <p>"Council welcomes the Natural Resources Access Regulator's officers to Mungindi as they work to ensure landholders affected by the restriction understand their obligations and comply with them," he said.</p>
      <p>"The temporary restriction order imposes the same rules on these landholders as those on people in town when it comes to domestic water use, which is only fair. This will help make what water is left last longer, which ties in with council's Water Supply Schemes Drought Management Plan."</p>
      <p>Specific details on the water restrictions for Mungindi are on the Moree Plains Shire Council website at <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__mpsc.nsw.gov.au&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=N9aEhCy8U0rJkO1xCZf7rgM9fohfR5qe_N93viZd7O8&amp;r=MJhtwPf3KQ3iKkRFQCP1RdgrLBqnEWH4PAAfImFEvy3-554_wpYMktGISkqaXyYx&amp;m=xzWv-7PrZ6zxObdQ3WdnQHmTmH0U32fvXbGqg5UmiK4&amp;s=cajlOk8Yjb0DkvEzng5M1T5b6yY71ZKlbnhF_tAptqs&amp;e=">mpsc.nsw.gov.au</a>.</p>
      <p>NRAR's investigators and compliance officers travel all over the state's 58 water sharing plan areas, inspecting properties and assessing compliance with water users' licences and the <i>Water Management Act 2000</i>.</p>
