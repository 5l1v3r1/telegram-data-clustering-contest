      <p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) - Gov. Tony Evers has vetoed a bill that would have allowed public schools to release the names of students' parents and guardians in student directories.</p>
      <p>Evers vetoed the measure Thursday, citing privacy concerns.</p>
      <p>Opponents had argued that allowing people to obtain the names of students' parents was an invasion of privacy that could lead to unintended consequences. Supporters argued it was a minor change and it didn't make sense that schools couldn't list the names of students' parents on directories.</p>
      <p>Schools must inform parents of what is considered directory data and provide them an opportunity to opt-out. Directory information currently includes such basic information as students' names, addresses, birthdates and phone numbers.</p>
      <p>The Legislature approved the Republican-sponsored bill on voice votes.</p>
