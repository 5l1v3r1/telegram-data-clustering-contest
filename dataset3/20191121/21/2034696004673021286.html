      <p>Squarepusher has released new material in the years since his last studio album. In 2016 he dropped <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/squarepusher-1193170">anti-Brexit track  ‘MIDI sans Frontières’.</a></p>
      <p>In an accompanying essay, Squarepusher wrote: “This piece of music was written in the aftermath of the referendum and I present it as the basis of an internationalist collaboration with sound makers irrespective of what kind of music they make, where they live, their background, their age -all are invited to participate.”</p>
      <p>Last year, he provided an ambient soundtrack for children’s TV channel CBeebies. His music was used for a show called <i>Daydreams</i>, narrated by Olivia Colman.</p>
