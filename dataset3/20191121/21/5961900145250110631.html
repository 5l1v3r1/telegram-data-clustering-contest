      <h1>Matty J Rinses ‘Bachelorette’ Finalist Ryan &amp; Says Angie Shoulda Picked Timm Over Carlin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:50:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:50</time> by <a rel="author">By Matt Galea</a></address>
      <p>Looks like the lads from this year’s <i>The Bachelorette</i> aren’t the only ones who were suss on old mate <b>Ryan Anderson</b> ‘coz former Bachelor <b>Matty J</b> has also voiced his disdain for the dog trainer.</p>
      <p>Speaking on his new podcast, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-babble/id1486977393?mt=2&amp;app=podcast">The Babble with Nat Bass &amp; Matty J</a>, the new papa said he’s never really trusted the bloke, mostly because of his past.</p>
      <p>“With Ryan I just didn’t like the fact that he won the Cosmo Tinder Bachelor of the Year, he had been DMing Angie but then never got the guts to say hey let’s go for a coffee,” Matty said.</p>
      <p>“Something was just… he just seemed a bit like he was above it all when he was on the show.”</p>

      <p>Johnson also said that one of Ryan’s dates with <b>Angie</b> was so boring that she probz “faked” being seasick just so she could leave.</p>
      <p>And Ryan isn’t the only contender from this year’s <i>Bachie</i> that he’s suss on as he also cast doubt over <b>Carlin Sterritt</b> who won the comp.</p>
      <p>“I’m happy because Angie is happy and she’s found love and that is what’s most important. But a part of me wanted <b>Timm</b>… I love Timm.”</p>
      <p>Jeez, tell us how ya really feel, mate.</p>

      <p>After <i>Bachie</i> wrapped last week, I spoke to Carlin and Angie and got them to <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/entertainment/angie-carlin-slam-trolls/">address their haters directly</a>.</p>
      <p>“From the very beginning, hearing all the criticism about my past marriage and stuff like that was hard,” Carlin said.</p>
      <p>“I was probably a bit naive going into the experience because I’ve never experienced anything like it before.”</p>

      <p>The good news is that dealing with critics (such as Matty) has taught him to grow a thick skin which is bloody great to hear.</p>
      <p>“But ya know what, I’ve become really resilient during the show and it’s all become white noise to me. I know people are going to be biased about who they like and will have nasty things to say but at the end of the day, it doesn’t affect me and my life with Angie whatsover.”</p>
