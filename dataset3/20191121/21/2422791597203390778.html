      <h1>Bars in Quebec town to give free non-alcoholic drinks to designated drivers</h1>

      <p>LAVAL, Que. -- Police in Laval, Que., are fighting impaired driving by teaming up with 24 bars in the city to offer free non-alcoholic drinks to designated drivers.</p>
      <p>The initiative provides a driver -- accompanied by at least two friends -- with a bracelet upon their arrival at the bar allowing them to get free non-alcoholic drinks determined by the bar.</p>
      <p>The drinks are served at the same rhythm as the alcoholic beverages.</p>
      <p>Police in Laval, just north of Montreal, say their target group is people aged between 18 and 25, but the program will be available to all.</p>
      <p>Participating bars received a kit including posters, bracelets and ink stamps to identify designated drivers.</p>
      <p>Laval police Chief Pierre Brochet says the program recognizes the important role of designated drivers and gives them the opportunity to celebrate while keeping roads safe.</p>
      <p>The program, dubbed CoDeBars, began in Sherbrooke, Que. in 2017. Gatineau, near Ottawa, also announced its involvement on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The city's police chief, Luc Beaudoin, says drinking and driving remains a major cause of road accidents.</p>
      <p>"Each year, Gatineau police handle hundreds of impaired driving cases," Beaudoin said in a statement. "Hundreds of cases too many -- despite the social consensus on the dangerousness of driving after drinking, too many drivers take the risk and endanger their own safety and the safety of others."</p>
      <p>Beaudoin says he's confident that programs like CoDeBars will make a difference.</p>
