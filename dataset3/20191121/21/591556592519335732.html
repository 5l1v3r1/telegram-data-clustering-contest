      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1197621020229804054">Twitter announced today</a> that users will finally be able to disable SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) for their accounts, and use an alternative method only, such as a mobile one-time code (OTP) authenticator app or a hardware security key.<br/><br/>Until today, this was impossible.<br/><br/>If users wanted to use 2FA for their Twitter account, they had to register a phone number and enable the SMS-based 2FA method, even if they wished it or not.</p>

      <p>Users who wanted to use an OTP mobile authenticator app or a hardware security key, had to enable the SMS-based 2FA first, and they couldn't disable it.<br/><br/>Even if the user chose to use a security key, the SMS-based 2FA method was still active, and exposed the account to attacks known as SIM swaps.</p>
      <p>Hackers who knew a user's password would perform a SIM swap to temporarily hijack a user's phone number, bypass SMS-based 2FA, and then take over that user's account. <br/><br/>For the past two years, many high-profile accounts have been hacked this way, but Twitter never budged on its decision to make SMS-based 2FA mandatory and an always-on option.</p>
      <p>Everything changed on August 30, this summer, when hackers used a SIM swap attack to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/jack-dorseys-twitter-account-got-hacked/">gain access to the Twitter account of Jack Dorsey, the Twitter CEO</a>.<br/><br/>While hackers didn't bypass 2FA in the case of his account, they did expose the dangers of SIM swapping to the Twitter CEO and his security team.<br/><br/>Starting today, users can finally disable SMS-based 2FA, and opt for a more secure 2FA method.<br/><br/>This also means that Twitter users can now delete the phone number associated with their account, and still be able to use 2FA -- something that was not possible before. This also inherently eliminates scenarios where SIM swappers who don't know a user's password can use the SMS-based password recovery feature to hijack accounts -- effectively plugging the SIM swapping attack vector for an account.<br/><br/>Twitter announced the feature today, but it has been under testing for more than a week, as spotted by a user over the weekend</p>
