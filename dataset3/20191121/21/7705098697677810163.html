      <p>Jean-Luc Picard is the focus of CBS All Access’ upcoming <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-trek"><b>Star Trek</b></a> series, but he won’t be alone on his travels. After a two decade hiatus, the former Starfleet captain will forge new alliances and also reunite with some recognizable faces. Recent trailers have given fans an early look at who these characters are. But now, CBS All Access has debuted some new photos that highlight <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-trek-picard"><b>Star Trek: Picard</b></a>’s supporting cast.</p>
      <p>In these pics, Picard once again cross paths with Jonathan Frakes’ William Riker. Frakes’ behind-the-scenes involvement with the series has been known for some time. In addition to reprising his famous role, Frakes will also direct the second “block” of episodes for the first season.</p>

      <p>We also see a new shot of Dahj, the young woman who comes to Picard for help. In one new photo, she’s sharing a tender moment with Narek, played by Harry Treadaway. Narek is a Romulan who becomes part of Picard’s new team. But Narek won’t be the only one of his species showing up. Evan Evagora will star as Elnor, another Romulan dedicated to Picard’s cause who is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant. Other new stills include Michelle Hurd’s Raffi Musiker and Santiago Cabrera’s Cristobal “Chris” Rios, both of whom are ex-Starfleet officers.</p>
      <p><b>Star Trek: Picard</b> will premiere on January 23 on CBS All Access.</p>
