      <h1>Antonio Brown-Patriots reunion rumors gaining momentum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:49:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Blinn</a></address>
      <p>The Patriots’ offense is scuffling and Tom Brady <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/tom-brady-cant-hide-his-anger-with-the-patriots-offense/">is unhappy</a>. How desperate are they?</p>
      <p>One possible solution being floated around NFL circles is bringing back embattled star wide receiver Antonio Brown.</p>
      <p>Brown, currently under investigation by the NFL and facing a sexual assault lawsuit, recently <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/antonio-brown-apologizes-to-robert-kraft-and-gets-tom-bradys-approval/">apologized to New England owner Robert Kraft</a> for comments made following his September release after just one game with the Patriots. That Instagram mea culpa was liked by Brady and other significant Patriots players.</p>
      <p>That has led to some speculation he could make a return to aid Brady’s sagging offense.</p>
      <p>“If I’m in there with the New England Patriots and the NFL says he’s cleared to play and he’s ready to go… I think you got to kick the tires,” former Patriots linebacker and NFL analyst Tedy Bruschi <a href="https://twitter.com/OMFonWEEI/status/1197304651600801797">told WEEI’s “OMF”</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Christian Fauria, an ex-Patriot and current WEEI radio host, <a href="https://twitter.com/OMFonWEEI/status/1197593734403313670">took it a step further</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“I think they have kicked the tires,” he said. “I know there have been discussions. That’s for sure”</p>
      <p>Brown met with the NFL last week as their months-long investigation seemingly is nearing a conclusion. Any chance the Patriots sign Brown would be dependent on the NFL’s decision.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/antonio-brown-countersues-ex-trainer-who-claims-he-raped-her/">Brown filed a countersuit on Wednesday</a> against Britney Taylor, who is accusing the longtime Steelers star of rape and sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Brown, who has field grievances against New England and the Oakland Raiders to recoup $40 million in salary, contract guarantees and fines, has pushed a Patriots reunion in the past.</p>
      <p>“If you guys follow the Patriots, tell them to call me,” Brown said <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/antonio-brown-has-a-message-for-the-patriots-apparently-still-wants-to-play-for-them/">in an Instagram post in October</a>. “They still gotta pay me, so might as well let me earn it.”</p>
