      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> and Andrew Maxwell had a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-ian-wright-andrew-maxwell-clash-crocodile-feet-footballer-got-bit-snappy-11191939/">disagreement on Wednesday night’s show over who would eat the last crocodile foot</a> – but all is well because they have now kissed and made up.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed over the crocodile foot (which looked like a chicken wing), after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts and Roman Kemp won the camp a luxury meal for collecting 10 stars during the bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>It all began when Jacqueline Jossa offered Ian an extra bit of ‘chicken’ – and the comedian couldn’t help but intervene.</p>
      <p>‘Ian everyone has had some there’s two there, go,’ Andrew added.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Come on seriously Ian.’</p>
      <p>It was when Andrew exclaimed: ‘Jesus the drama’ when Ian got a bit snappy (see what I did there) as he raged: ‘I said I don’t want no more f***ing crocodile.’</p>

      <p>However, after having a good night’s sleep (well kind of) Ian and Andrew resolved their disagreement in the most manly way possible.</p>

      <p>As they relaxed in the camp Ian asked:  ‘Is everything ok because we had a moment with dinner? We cool?’</p>
      <p>Andrew responded: ‘From my perspective, I was cool at the time, 100%, zero bother my end.’</p>
      <p>Afterwards the former footballer exclaimed: ‘Good news man, I don’t want people to have a bad day because of something I’ve said. If you know you’re wrong, say it and move on, don’t let things fester.’</p>
      <p>However it wasn’t long before the comedian clashed with another campmate – only this time it was Jacqueline Jossa.</p>

      <p>Tonight we also saw new campmates Coronation Street star Andy Whyment and actor Cliff Parisi enter the jungle, although they were immediately sent to the jailhouse after winning the camp eight stars for dinner.</p>
      <p>Although in another twist the celebs at the main camp could choose to share their luxury meals with the duo, who were stuck in the jail, but it meant two of the campmates would have to join them in jail.</p>

      <p>Kate Garraway and Ian Wright both agreed to go, but Roman decided the best way to agree fairly would be to draw named water bottles.</p>
      <p>The discussion then got rather heated between Jacqueline and Andrew as the mum-of-two admitted she ‘didn’t want to go’</p>
      <p>Andrew exclaimed:  ‘I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out.’</p>

      <p>James Haskell responded: ‘If she doesn’t want to do it, don’t do it.’</p>

      <p>Andrew continued: ‘It’s an ordeal that has to be shared.  It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything.’</p>
      <p>Adele the added: ‘I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it. If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed.’</p>
      <p>Andrew didn’t understand why Nadine and Jacqueline wouldn’t put themselves up like everyone else.</p>
      <p>The campmates picked out named water bottles out of a bag and the last two remaining were the two to go to the Jailhouse – they were Kate and Andrew.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Jacqueline and Andrew have a heated exchange as the<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-andrew-maxwell-catches-jacqueline-jossa-talking-super-awkward-moment-11193330/"> comedian caught the actress talking about him the day before</a> – awks!</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/who-is-adele-roberts-and-what-has-the-im-a-celebrity-star-done-since-leaving-big-brother-11167584/">Adele Roberts</a> had the first clash of the series over the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">iconic Jane McDonald photo, which Adele brought in as her luxury item.</a></p>
      <p>Talking together in the main camp, Kate Garraway and Roman are talking about the picture, which Adele brought in as her ‘luxury item’.</p>

      <p>While Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness has since cleared up why she brought in the framed photo, the campmates where nonethewiser.</p>
      <p>But Kate saw the plus side, as Kate asked: ‘Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?’</p>
      <p>Admitting she didn’t know any, Adele said: ‘I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Adele then feels cornered by Myles and Roman who laugh at her, with Roman declared: ‘No one knows what she does.’</p>
      <p>As Kate backed up Adele and Jane, Roman put her on the spot, and asked her: ‘She’s a legend is she? Name a song?’</p>
