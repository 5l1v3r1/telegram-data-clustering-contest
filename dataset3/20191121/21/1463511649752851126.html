      <h1>Reps make case for road construction in Imo</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:08:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>The House of Representatives has urged the Federal Roads Maintenance Agency to urgently undertake remedial works on the</p>
      <p>Owerri-Orlu-Ideato-Uga Federal Road in Imo.</p>
      <p>This was sequel to a unanimous adoption of a motion by Hon. Chogozie Obi at the plenary on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Moving the motion earlier, Obi said that the road linked Owerri, the capital of Imo through Uga to Awka, the capital of Anambra.</p>
      <p>Obi said that stretches of the road from Orlu-Mgbee-Umuchima-Obiohia-Urualla have collapsed with devastating gullies on both sides of the road.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said that the Government of Imo State under Senator Rochas Okorocha had executed projects and made appreciable efforts with regard to the road.</p>
      <p>He, however, said that unintended flooding destroyed some of the works to unmanageable proportions.</p>
      <p>According to him, the heavy traffic on the road which links several local government headquarters in Imo could constitute further hazards to communities, villages and hamlets in Ideato Federal Constituency.</p>
      <p>“The grave devastation on the road, includes the collapse of Umuchima-Mgbee bridge as a result of excessive erosion as well as the non-continuation of the expansion and dualisation project on the road.</p>
      <p>“The high death rates from accidents and other minor mishaps, especially on the collapsed bridge linking Mgbee, Orlu and Umuchima, including the ravaging impact of the erosion is becoming a menace,” he said.</p>
      <p>The House, therefore, urged the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing to include the duailisation of the road in the 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>In his ruling, the Deputy Speaker of the House, Idris Wase, mandated the Committees on Works and Housing and Appropriations to ensure compliance.</p>
