      <p>Beaujolais Nouveau wine lovers made merry as this year's first bottles were uncorked, but producers faced the sobering truth of a dip in margins due to new tariffs imposed by the United States, their second biggest export market.</p>
      <p>LYON, France: Beaujolais Nouveau wine lovers made merry as this year's first bottles were uncorked, but producers faced the sobering truth of a dip in margins due to new tariffs imposed by the United States, their second biggest export market.</p>
      <p>Barrels of this season's vintage, a red made from Gamay grapes in the Beaujolais region, were rolled through the streets of Lyon in a traditional torchlit procession.</p>

      <p>As the clock struck midnight on the third Thursday of November, bottles were popped open for late-night drinkers wearing "I Heart Beaujolais" T-shirts.</p>
      <p>This year's Beaujolais Nouveau Day celebrations come a month after the U.S. imposed a 25per cent tax on French wine and other EU goods in response to illegal EU aircraft subsidies.</p>
      <p>"This is going to be a hard blow, we will need to work hard to bounce back," said Jean-Baptiste Duperray a producer of the popular young wine, fermented for just a few weeks before hitting shelves around the world.</p>
      <p>U.S. Beaujolais lovers will see little impact on their wallets, with prices remaining between US$10 to US$15 per bottle as dealers dug into their own pockets to hold prices steady, David Ratignier, vice-president of the Inter Beaujolais Association, said.</p>
      <p>"This is what has enabled us to maintain our volumes, to maintain the Beaujolais Nouveauâ€™s release in the United States. So we can say it's gone pretty well after all," he said.</p>
      <p>The U.S. is the second largest export market for the light-colored red, with 13,337 hectolitres shipped in 2018, accounting for more than 15per cent of total exports and almost 8per cent of production.</p>
      <p>In Japan, the top importer of Beaujolais Nouveau, men and women in straw hats, swimming shorts and bikini tops, and their children in floaters, soaked themselves in a "wine bath" that matched the color of the vintage to mark its 2019 launch.</p>
      <p>Beaujolais Nouveau winemakers said they had little choice but to absorb U.S. President Donald Trump's additional tariff, monitor sales and hope it was short-lived.</p>
      <p>"We realized (U.S. policy) can change in a morning with a simple tweet from Mr Trump. If Trump changes his mind overnight, everything will be ok," Ratignier said.</p>
