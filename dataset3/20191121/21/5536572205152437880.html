      <h1>Baker Mayfield Claims He Never Heard Anything From Myles Garrett About Mason Rudolph Using A Racial Slur</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:40:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:40</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>The allegation made by Browns defensive end Myles Garrett that Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph used a racial slur during the massive brawl on Thursday Night Football threw social media in a complete frenzy.</p>
      <p>It not only caught us off guard, but Garrett’s teammates as well.</p>
      <p>Two Browns players were directly asked by ESPN’s local beat writer, Jake Trotter, if they heard Rudolph say anything or if they had heard anything in their locker room about a racial slur prior to today.</p>
      <p>Neither Baker Mayfield nor Sheldon Richardson had heard anything.</p>
