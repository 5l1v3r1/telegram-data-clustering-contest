      <h1>Katharine McPhee, 35, pokes fun at age difference to husband David Foster, 70, in cheeky Twitter post</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/katharine-mcphee">Katherine McPhee</a> isn’t at all fazed by the fact her husband <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katharine-mcphee-changes-last-name-to-foster-celebrates-honeymoon-with-david-foster-in-italy">David Foster </a>is <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katharine-mcphee-and-david-foster-clap-back-at-relationship-haters-we-understand-each-other">double her age</a>.</p>
      <p>The former “American Idol” standout made it a point to poke some fun at the pair’s age gap in response to a fan who mentioned how McPhee was absent from the 16-time Grammy-winning Foster’s 1992 Christmas album.</p>
      <p>“Am I playing #DavidFoster 's 1992 xmas album for my entire office? Yes. Do I have no shame? Yes. The only downside is no @katharinemcphee on this album,” one Twitter user wrote, tagging McPhee in the post.</p>

      <p>“The recording schedule for this conflicted with my 3rd grade homework, unfortunately,” McPhee <a href="https://twitter.com/katharinemcphee/status/1196915689979666432">bantered</a>, spurring a slew of memes praising the “Waitress” Broadway performer for her witty remark.</p>

      <p>The pair has previously defended their age difference with McPhee calling their love “genuine,” adding that they “respect each other and have for a very long time.”</p>
      <p>“There are just a lot of things when you look at the history of our relationship, neither of us could have written it,” she told <a href="http://people.com/music/katharine-mcphee-david-foster-open-up-about-their-love/">People</a> in September 2018. “I would never have imagined that this would be our future together.”</p>

      <p>“We understand each other,” Foster, 70, said.</p>
      <p>“He has things to learn from me and I have a lot of things to learn from him. So I think we have a nice yin and yang," McPhee concluded. “It doesn’t make sense to a lot of people, but it does to us."</p>

For her very special day, McPhee <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katharine-mcphee-wedding-dress">wore a custom-designed strapless gown</a> by American designer Zac Posen.
