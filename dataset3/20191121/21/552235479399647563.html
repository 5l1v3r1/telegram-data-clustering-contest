      <h2>Elizabeth Mary O'Sullivan left her three pet cats at her old property without food or water when she moved home.</h2>

      <p>A callous woman whose abandoned, dying <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">cat</a> was forced to eat two other <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cats">cats</a> to survive has been <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/court">jailed</a> for 20 weeks.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Mary O'Sullivan, 52, selfishly left behind her three <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/pets">pet cats</a> at her old property when she moved home in March.</p>
      <p>JPs heard when local authority housing officers attended on May 16 they came across the remains of two black and white cats and found another one barely alive.</p>
      <p>Shocked RPSCA inspectors attended the property in Moseley, Birmingham and were shocked to find the dismembered remains of the two animals on the lounge floor.</p>
      <p>Another collapsed cat was in a critical condition having only survived without food and water for several weeks by eating the remains of the others and drinking from the toilet.</p>
      <p>RPSCA Inspector Jonathan Radcliffe took the cat for emergency veterinary treatment where the decision was made to put him to sleep to end his suffering.</p>
      <p>O'Sullivan was traced to a nearby address 10 days later and was arrested by police but she failed to appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on two occasions.</p>
      <p>She was tried and found guilty in her absence last Friday of causing unnecessary suffering to three cats contrary to the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>
      <p>O'Sullivan was arrested two days later and brought before JPs for sentencing on Monday.</p>
      <p>Magistrates described the case as "appalling" as they banned her from keeping animals for life and ordered her to pay a Â£150 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>Inspector Radcliffe said: "The flat was filthy and the remains of two dismembered cats were on the living room floor.</p>
      <p>"There was also a cat which was barely alive collapsed nearby.</p>
      <p>"It appears this cat had survived for weeks without food and water by eating the remains of the other two pets as they had died from starvation and dehydration.</p>
      <p>"There was no food and water in the flat - but the toilet seat had been left up so the cats may have been able to drink from this, however, as they became weaker they would have been unable to access this water.</p>
      <p>"It is incomprehensible to think the suffering these pets must have endured and how terrified they must have been for such a long period of time before dying of starvation.</p>
      <p>"It must have been awful for the remaining cat to watch as the others died in front of him and then he was forced to eat their remains in a desperate attempt to survive.</p>
      <p>"Sadly this cat was too ill to recover from his ordeal."</p>
