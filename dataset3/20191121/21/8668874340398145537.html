      <h1>Rumoured French tour to Japan should worry All Blacks and Wallabies fans but might spark good news for Pacific Islands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:32:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:32</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Vinicombe</a></address>
      <p>If rumours out of <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> are anything to go by, then <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> could be in for underwhelming Test schedules in 2021.</p>
      <p>French newspaper <i>L’Équipe</i> has reported that France will embark on a two-game tour to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/japan">Japan</a> in 2021. The last time that France and Japan clashed was in 2017, with the two sides recording a draw.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/rugby-world-cup">Rugby World Cup</a> showed that the Brave Blossoms are more than capable of footing it with the tier-one teams around the world. England have <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/england-set-for-japanese-return-eight-months-after-world-cup-final-loss/">already locked in a tour to the Land of the Rising Sun in 2020</a>, giving Japan two exceptional July series over the next two years.</p>
      <p>Japan’s gain could be Australasia’s loss, however, with quality Northern Hemisphere opposition likely to be hard to come by thanks to the British and Irish <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/lions">Lions</a> tour.</p>
      <p>The Lions will travel to <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/south-africa">South Africa</a> in 2021, which will gut England, Ireland, Wales and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> of a number of key players. That leaves France as the only European powerhouse who will have a full contingent available.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>In 2017, during the previous Lions tour to New Zealand, France travelled to South Africa for a three-match series.</p>
      <p>Australia, meanwhile, played in a quasi-tournament with Fiji, Scotland and Italy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> and Wallabies will now be looking at similar schedules for 2021, if it does come to light that Japan are hosting France.</p>

      <p>A match between New Zealand and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/italy">Italy</a> could be on the table, with the Italians last travelling to New Zealand in 2009. The two nations were supposed to duke it out in this year’s World Cup but <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/world-rugby-reacts-to-shock-all-blacks-cancellation-claim/">the game was famously called off due to Typhoon Hagibis</a>.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the Pacific Island sides could have the most to gain.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/fiji-set-for-massive-clash-at-beginning-of-2020-test-season/">Fiji will play the Wallabies next year</a> and are understood to have already secured a game against the All Blacks in 2021. With few other appealing opposition on offer, NZR could look to line up matches against other Pacific Nations sides – and Rugby Australia will likely try something similar.</p>

      <p>France will almost certainly add one additional game to their July schedule, which could see them travel to one of the Antipodean nations for a final game.</p>
      <p>One way or another, the best Test rugby on offer will be coming out of Africa, with the world champion Springboks hosting what promises to be an exciting Lions side.</p>
