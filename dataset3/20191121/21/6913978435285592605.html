      <p><b>WASHINGTON —</b> Embattled office sharing startup WeWork will lay off 2,400 employees worldwide as the it struggles to reorganize amid mounting losses, the company announced Thursday.<br/><br/>The painful job cuts underscore the rapid decline of what had been one of America's most celebrated startups, that has left a mammoth footprint in the commercial real estate of major cities around the globe but recently had to cancel its IPO.<br/><br/>The layoffs which began "weeks ago" were necessary "to create a more efficient organization," a WeWork spokesperson said in a statement.<br/><br/>The dismissed workers "will receive severance, continued benefits, and other forms of assistance to aid in their career transition."<br/><br/>"These are incredibly talented professionals and we are grateful for the important roles they have played in building WeWork over the last decade," the spokesperson said.<br/><br/>The company told shareholders earlier this month it lost almost $1.3 billion in the third quarter, more than twice the losses recorded in the same period a year earlier.<br/><br/>As investors and analysts questioned the company's value, WeWork in September scrapped plans for its Wall Street debut, forced out chief executive Adam Neumann and took a bailout from Japan's SoftBank Group, a major investor.<br/><br/>Neumann stepped down from the board of directors with a $1.7 billion exit package while the company's value was slashed to $8 billion — a far cry from its $47 billion valuation at the start of this year and just a fraction of the sum envisioned as part of the failed IPO.<br/><br/>A source told AFP that Neumann will get $1 billion for his SoftBank shares, $500 million for reimbursements of personal debts and $185 million in consulting fees.<br/><br/>The unconventional entrepreneur had faced simmering questions over his management style, loose approach to corporate governance and allegations of self-dealing — not to mention a Wall Street Journal expose which laid out Neumann's drug and alcohol use and his aspiration to become the world's first trillionaire.<br/><br/>A former employee, Maria Bardhi, filed a labor a grievance in New York accusing Neumann of pregnancy discrimination, saying he referred to her maternity leave as "vacation" and "retirement."<br/><br/>The company also allegedly paid Bardhi's temporary replacement twice her salary, and fired her six months after her return.<br/><br/>The WeWork debacle contributed to woes at SoftBank, which earlier this month announced its largest quarterly loss ever at $6.4 billion.<br/><br/>Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's chief executive, expressed remorse and acknowledged having misjudged both ride-hailing giant Uber and WeWork.<br/><br/>"My investment decisions were in many ways poor. I regret them deeply," he said.— AFP</p>
