      <h1>Animal rights activists unswayed by new racing safety initiatives</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:03:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/mike-brunker/" target="_blank">Mike Brunker</a></address>
      <p>Efforts to improve safety of racehorses are gaining momentum, but there is no indication that the new measures will assuage animal rights activists who insist that horse racing has no place on the sporting landscape.</p>
      <p>Further evidence that the outcry over horse deaths at Santa Anita Park and Del Mar is being heard far outside California came this week with the announcement of the creation of the Thoroughbred Safety Coalition.</p>
      <p>The initiative was announced by the Breeders’ Cup and major U.S. racetrack owners — Keeneland Association Inc., the New York Racing Association Inc., Del Mar Thoroughbred Club and The Stronach Group.</p>
      <p>The group’s stated goal is “to unify and enhance existing protections and work together to develop new reforms to ensure the safety of the sport’s equine and human athletes.” It aims to accomplish that by adopting best practices and stricter guidelines for allowable medications, enacting uniform standards for riding crop use, encouraging greater transparency and tracking of veterinarian exam records, and committing to the creation of new positions to implement and enforce the reforms.</p>
      <p>“With this coalition nothing is off the table,” Breeders’ Cup President Drew Fleming told me this week. “We are interested in immediate change and immediate positive reforms.”</p>
      <p>The formation of the new group drew statements of support from other racing groups, including the Jockey Club and the HBPA, the national horseman’s group. That’s no small feat, given that disputes among various industry players have stalled efforts to pass the Horse Racing Integrity Act, which is currently awaiting congressional action.</p>
      <p>Racing fans and horse lovers of all stripes can thank animal rights activists for spurring the industry to act on something it should have addressed long ago. But as a testy meeting Thursday of the California Horse Racing Board demonstrated, they aren’t satisfied with a safer sport. They want it gone.</p>
      <p>“Santa Anita has proven time and time again that they cannot keep horses safe,” one speaker said at the meeting, during which board members conditionally approved Santa Anita’s traditional winter meeting starting on Dec. 26. “… There is no turning back the clock for this archaic so-called sport. You are beating a dead horse.”</p>
      <p>That and other comments at the meeting lay bare the long-term goal here, which is an outright ban of the sport. And given the attention their PR war has gotten so far, that doesn’t seem anywhere near as unlikely as it did at this time last year before Santa Anita’s disastrous winter meet began.</p>

        <b>Ellis Starr’s Red Smith Stakes analysis</b>
      </p>
      <p>In this year’s Red Smith, one of the things which appears certain is a contested pace scenario, as <b>Tiz a Slam</b> and <b>Glorious Empire</b> (IRE) have earned nearly all their wins when leading from the start. European import <b>Petit Fils</b> (FR) shows the comment line “straight to lead” in two of his most recent races as well. With that in mind, the horses which can stalk the pace in third through fifth appear to have the best chance to succeed.</p>
      <p><b>Marzo</b> tops that list. He was claimed by trainer Mike Maker for $62,500 in August and two races later won the Sycamore Stakes at the marathon distance of 1 1/2 miles on turf. Maker, who has a knack for finding horses who can become stakes winners in long races on grass, appears to have found another gem as Marzo earned a career best 109 Equibase Speed Figure off the claim when beaten a neck before earning a 106 figure in the Sycamore. Answering the question as to whether Marzo can run another “A” race good enough to win the Red Smith, a STATS Race Lens query on Maker’s record with horses having won back-to-back in stakes races reveals Maker has a 10-for-42 record over the past five years, which suggests Marzo can win his second grade 3 stakes race in a row.</p>
      <p><b>Red Knight</b> is proven in stakes and in marathon races like the 11 furlong Red Smith. A winner of seven of 14 career turf races, Red Knight won the H. Allen Jerkens Stakes last December at the distance of two miles and in his most recent race he won the Point of Entry Stakes at a mile and one-half. Earning a 110 figure in the Point of Entry, Red Knight matches up nicely with the best in the Red Smith field and appears to be a strong contender to win.</p>
      <p>On Class alone, <b>Sadler’s Joy</b> must be respected. Although having won just one race in 11 starts in 2018 and 2019 combined, Sadler’s Joy faces easier than in his last two races when beaten a neck in the Sword Dancer Stakes with a 113 figure and when beaten a half-length in the Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Stakes with a 117 figure. Other than the class drop, Sadler’s Joy has one more factor in his favor and that is he won his only previous try at this mile and three-eighths distance on the Aqueduct turf, back in November, 2016.</p>
      <p>The rest of the Red Smith field (excluding the horses entered for the main track only), with their best Equibase Figures in representative races: <b>Dot Matrix</b> (105), <b>Glorious Empire</b> (IRE) (118), <b>Have At It</b> (112), <b>Mokheef</b> (95), <b>Nakamura</b> (110), <b>Postulation</b> (112), <b>Petit Fils</b> (FR) (112), <b>Red Right Hand</b> (108) and <b>Zumurdee</b> (112).</p>
