      <p>Last year, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/brands/maharishi">maharishi</a> partnered with legendary graffiti writer <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/teach">TEACH</a> for a <a href="https://www.maharishistore.com/products/9065-teach-stay-human-t-shirt/Black">“Yeah of the Pig”</a> capsule collection that launched alongside the British artist’s <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/12/maharishi-teach-exhibition-soho-london-store">“They Taste Yeah Yeah” exhibition</a>. The duo are teaming up again for a limited edition print, entitled ‘Each One Teach One.’</p>
      <p>The hand-screen printed artwork features TEACH’s signature script in contrasting blue, red and white colors. The words, emboldened by a thick black outline and surrounded by paint-like drips, give the 420 x 594 mm print a sense of depth. <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/12/maharishi-teach-exhibition-soho-london-store">maharishi explains</a> the importance of its ongoing collaborations with the graffiti artist: “TEACH, who has been active since the ’90s and a member of London’s infamous DDS crew, the Kings of the London Underground, has influenced a whole generation of younger writers from his ethos on the culture to his hand style, throw-up’s, trains and consistency.”</p>
      <p>Available in an edition of 30, TEACH’s ‘Each One Teach One’ print is available to purchase now for £75 (approx. $95 USD) on <a href="https://www.maharishistore.com/products/teach-each-one-teach-one/Screenprint">maharishi’s website</a> and at its store location in London. Each print is signed and numbered by the artist.</p>
      <p>For more art drops, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/devin-troy-strother-print-them-all-heavy-is-the-head-that-wears-the-afro-lithograph-release-info">Devin Troy Strother released his ‘Heavy Is The Head That Wears The Afro’ lithograph in collaboration with Print Them All</a>.</p>
