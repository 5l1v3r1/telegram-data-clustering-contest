      <p>Amy Schumer may have just won Instagram with an iconic photo of herself posing alongside Phoebe Waller Bridge, J-Law and David Byrne.</p>
      <p>That’s right, the four legends could be seen huddled together for the picture, where they all beamed down the camera lens – and we grinned right back.</p>
      <p>But what are they plotting?</p>
      <p>Giving nothing away in the caption, the 38-year-old sent her 9.4million followers into a frenzy as she simply wrote: ‘I guess that this must be the place.’</p>
      <p>And right on cue, fans flocked to the comments section where they pondered over what the gathering of A-listers might entail.</p>

      <p>‘Omg please tell me y’all are filming??!?’ one wrote while another said: ‘Dream dinner party line up right there.’</p>
      <p>Someone else appeared to be in agreement, as they added: ‘What! To be a fly on the wall…’</p>

      <p>But while Amy couldn’t wait to dish up her evening on her socials, her newfound squad has remained quiet over the meeting.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Lawrence and Amy go way back with the mother-of-one attending her fellow actress’s wedding early this year.</p>

      <p>Sharing a picture from the big day, she wrote: ‘Chris and I had the best time #balmain.’</p>
      <p>Jennifer wed Cooke Maroney on Saturday 20 October in a lavish ceremony in Newport, Rhode Island.</p>
      <p>Other celebrity guests at the ceremony included Keeping Up With the Kardashians star Kris Jenner and 21 Bridges actress Sienna Miller.</p>
      <p>Then, of course, there was also the 29-year-old’s ultimate celebrity BFF, Adele.</p>
      <p>Jennifer, who won an Oscar for Best Actress in 2012 for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, reportedly wore a Dior gown for the wedding.</p>
      <p>After saying their vows, the newly-weds hosted a reception at the swanky Belcourt of Newport.</p>
