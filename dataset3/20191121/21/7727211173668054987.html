      <p>The landlord of a country pub turned into a brutal murderer after fearing his web of lies and seedy affair would be exposed.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/helen-mccourt-simms-killer-prison-10831854">Ian Simms</a> is set to be released from prison after 30 years behind bars for killing 22-year-old <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/breaking-helen-mccourt-killer-simms-17294216">Helen McCourt</a> in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/st-helens">St Helens</a> , in 1988.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/breaking-helen-mccourt-killer-simms-17294216">never told police where he disposed of her body</a> despite her family repeatedly appealing for him to do so.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/parole-board-explain-reasons-freed-17294424">parole board controversially</a> said that Simms could be released as he did not represent a significant risk to the public.</p>

      <p>The country was outraged at the decision and many questions are still being asked about the murder that rocked Merseyside.</p>
      <p>With Helen's body still not recovered, people are asking what could lead a supposed "family man" to kill, theories believe it was his own sordid behaviour.</p>

        <b>Web of lies about to unravel</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two days before Helen's disappearance, Helen got into a row with another woman in a pub called the George and Dragon - now the Billinge Arms.</p>
      <p>Ian Simms, 31, was the landlord of the pub at the time and lived there with his wife and two small children.</p>

      <p>After the argument between the two women, Simms banned Helen from the pub and a number of customers witnessed him shouting about her and using obscene language about.</p>
      <p>He reportedly also said he "hated" Helen but it soon came to light that he had previously made sexual advances towards the 22-year-old insurance clerk and she rejected him.</p>
      <p>At the time, Simms was also having an affair with a 21-year-old mistress and he believed Helen knew about it.</p>
      <p>Many people believe that Simms killed Helen because she rejected him and was worried she would reveal his affair to his wife.</p>

      <p>On the day of her murder, Helen McCourt spoke to her mum Marie on the phone about an hour before she left work.</p>
      <p>She was planning to go out for the evening with her new boyfriend and wanted her tea ready earlier so she had time to wash her hair.</p>
      <p>As Helen got off her bus at around 5.30pm she began walking home, a route that took her past the pub.</p>
      <p>Within minutes, a man getting off another bus heard a loud scream coming from the pub that was cut short.</p>
      <p>Helen has never been seen or heard from since that night.</p>
