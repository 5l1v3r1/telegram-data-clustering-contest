      <p>Nordstrom Inc. rose in late U.S. trading after quarterly sales and profit beat analysts’ predictions, bucking the weakness in the department-store sector going into the crucial holiday season.</p>

      <p>• Nordstrom’s new Manhattan flagship, a 320,000-square-foot store opened last month, drew reflected a strong customer response with 85,000 visits during the first weekend. Executives have called the new location the biggest bet in Nordstrom’s 118-year history.</p>
