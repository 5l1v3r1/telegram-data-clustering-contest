      <h2>Attack the wings.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:25:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/author/Asher%20Madan" target="_blank">Asher Madan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-launches-xbox-one">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> is an Xbox One, PC, and PlayStation 4 game that features exploration and a lot of Dark Souls-like combat. There are a lot of challenging bosses in the game, but Gorgara on Dathomir is one of the worst. It's a massive, crazed, bat-like monster that packs quite a punch. You have to dodge again and again, as well as double jump to avoid its shockwave and echolocation attacks. This is quite possibly one of the hardest fights in the game.</p>
      <p>Luckily, there's a great way to defeat Gorgara. Keep in mind that it's useless to attack its body, you have to keep on hitting the wings. Additionally, don't lock onto it because that limits your range of motion. Eventually, Gorgara does a stab attack where its wing gets lodged into the ground. If you keep on hitting it, then the second phase triggers where he stabs the ground with the other wing. If you do enough damage to both wings, it staggers, and you can Force Pull it to the ground and hit it in the head a few times.</p>

      <p>This is the only way to do massive amounts of damage. You have to keep on dodging its attacks and repeating this process to be successful. While this boss fighting takes patience, only attack Gorgara if you can hit its wings. Don't even bother attacking the legs or posterior because it can one-hit-kill if you if your health isn't full. The video tells you exactly what you need to do.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, there are two parts to this fight. After you've almost killed Gorgara the first time around, it'll run away and a few minutes later when you're climbing the wall in the next section, it'll chase you. Just climb the wall as fast as you can, jump if you have to to reach the top. Once there, you'll have to skydive onto Gorgara. Luckily, this portion is quite forgiving so it's a breeze to get through. It's mostly an interactive cutscene.</p>
