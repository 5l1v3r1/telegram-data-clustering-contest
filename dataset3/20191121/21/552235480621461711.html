      <h1>Young mum who died during Brazilian butt lift op in Turkey 'may not have known risks'</h1>
      <h2>Leah Cambridge, 29, died from an embolism after fat was accidentally injected into her veins, triggering three heart attacks.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:20:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Dailyrecord.co.uk</a></address>
      <p>A mother-of-three who died during a £6,500 Brazilian <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cosmetic-surgery">butt lift</a> operation may not have been properly told of the risks of the surgery, an inquest heard.</p>
      <p>Simon Withey, an expert consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, said the operation that killed Leah Cambridge is "at least ten times riskier" than the next most dangerous <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/cosmetic-surgery">cosmetic surgery</a> .</p>
      <p>Ms Cambridge, 29, died from an embolism after fat was accidentally injected into her veins, triggering three <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/heart-attack">heart attacks</a> on the operating table.</p>
      <p>Mr Withey told the court that patients undergoing the surgery are often vulnerable due to a "frenzy of excitement" and that he doubted whether Ms Cambridge was properly told of the risks associated with her operation.</p>
      <p>He said he felt Ms Cambridge was not given enough time to read documents put before her in the hospital prior to her surgery or told of the risks involved.</p>

      <p>He said: "She was a willing participant, but as to whether she was informed appropriately, I have my doubts.</p>
      <p>"At that time, you're not going to change your mind, you don't have time to think about it or to sleep on it.</p>
      <p>"This is a challenging read at the best of times."</p>
      <p>Mr Withey quoted figures from US research that suggested the procedure has a mortality rate of between 1 in 2,600 and 1 in 6,000.</p>
      <p>According to the research, the next most risky operation, the tummy tuck, had a death rate of between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 30,000, he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Withey told Wakefield Coroner's Court he believes the figures could be even higher as many doctors "over estimate the number of operations they perform and underestimate the number of complications".</p>
      <p>He said the vast majority of deaths that occurred during the butt lift, which extracts fat from other areas of the body to be re-injected into the buttocks, were due to injections into veins.</p>
      <p>The former president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) told the court the organisation issued a moratorium, or temporary halt, to the butt lift being performed in the UK just months after the mother-of-three's fatal operation.</p>
      <p>He described BAAPS as a charity that represents patients, which around 70-80 percent of plastic surgeons working in the UK are signed up to.</p>
      <p>He said: "We were talking about it beforehand, it just happened that this death was reported shortly before a meeting we had and it focused everyone's mind.</p>

      <p>"Surgeons who know what they are doing and do things very safely will still have deaths.</p>
      <p>"It is not performed in the UK to anywhere like the same extent as it is in America.</p>
      <p>"We are the only country to have a moratorium. We represent the patients as a charity.</p>
      <p>"This is an operation which has a mortality rate at least ten times the next riskiest operation.</p>
      <p>"Until further work is done to understand how to do the operation more safely, we felt surgeons should not do this operation."</p>
      <p>Beautician Ms Cambridge, 29, lived in Leeds, West Yorkshire, with her partner Scott Franks and three young children.</p>
      <p>She flew out to Izmir in Turkey in August 2018 after arranging a package with Elite Aftercare.</p>
      <p>She tragically died on the operating table after fat that had been removed from her stomach was injected too far into her buttocks and entered her blood stream, causing an embolism in her pulmonary artery.</p>
      <p>The inquest continues.</p>
