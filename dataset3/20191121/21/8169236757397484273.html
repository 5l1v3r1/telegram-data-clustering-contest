        <b>Jose Mourinho is reportedly considering a move to sign Zlatan Ibrahimovic on a free transfer for his new club Tottenham.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 38-year-old forward is available after recently leaving LA Galaxy, and is a player well known by Mourinho after playing under him at both Manchester United and Inter Milan.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/21/declan-rice-tottenham-transfer-battle-with-man-united/">Jose Mourinho instructs Tottenham to rival Manchester United for potential £38.5million transfer</a></h3>
      <p>Spurs could perhaps do with more cover for Harry Kane up front after the departure of Fernando Llorente during the summer, and the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/tottenham-linked-veteran-forward-zlatan-ibrahimovic-following/">Telegraph</a> claim they could swoop to sign Ibrahimovic.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen if the Swedish veteran will choose Tottenham over other clubs, with the Telegraph explaining he could have a number of other options in Serie A.</p>
      <p>While Ibrahimovic may not have long left at the highest level, he proved a useful short-term signing for Man Utd and could well have contributed even more if not for a bad injury towards the end of his first season at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>He’s since come back very strongly in his time in the MLS and surely still has the natural ability to make a difference in Premier League matches.</p>
      <p>After a difficult start to the season, the combination of Mourinho and Ibrahimovic could really make for great entertainment for Tottenham fans.</p>
