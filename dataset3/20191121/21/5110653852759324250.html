      <h1>Nikita Kucherov injury update: Tampa Bay Lightning star will not play Thursday due to upper-body injury</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:52:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>Tampa Bay Lightning superstar Nikita Kucherov <a href="https://twitter.com/NHLdotcom/status/1197625733239078912">will not play against the Chicago Blackhawks</a> Thursday due to his upper-body injury.</p>
      <p>Kucherov, 26,<a href="https://twitter.com/BBurnsNHL/status/1197009600618336256">left Tuesday's game against the St. Louis Blues</a>late in the second periodafter he was hit by Brayden Schenn. Tampa Bay head coach Jon Cooper said that the injury is not concussion-related, but no more specific are known about the forward's condition as of Nov. 21.</p>
      <p>Schenn issued Kucherov a blindside hit as the Russian goal-scorerbackhanded the puck at theTampa Bay blue line during Tuesday'sgame.</p>

      <p>A crowd gathered around Schenn after the hit and Tampa Bay's Erik Cernak was ultimately issued two roughing penalties for seeking retribution on Schenn. Schenn himself was given a two-minute minor for roughing Kucherov on a late hit.</p>
      <p>Head coach Jon Cooper said after the game that Kucherov's injury was not related to a concussion, but Kucherov was not able to return after he skated off the ice on his own.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old has 18 points in 18 matchups after Tuesday's game.</p>
      <p>Losing Kucherov, the reigning Hart Memorial Trophy and Art Ross Trophy winner, would prove a major blow to a Tampa Bay team still on the wrong side of the Eastern Conference's playoff picture.</p>
      <p>The Blues defeated the Lightning 3-1 on Tuesday.</p>
