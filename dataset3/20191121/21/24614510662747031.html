      <p>Now let’s take a more in-depth look at the current Intuit earnings report.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adjusted per-share earnings for the quarter are up 41.38% from 29 cents in the same period of the year prior.</li>
        <li>Revenue is sitting 14.71% higher than the $1.02 billion reported in fiscal Q1 2019.</li>
        <li>INTU reported operating income during the quarter compared to an operating loss in the fiscal first quarter of 2019.</li>
        <li>The Intuit earnings report also has net income coming in at $57 million.</li>
        <li>This is a 67.65% increase from the company’s net income of $34 million reported during the same time last year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sasan Goodarzi, CEO of Intuit, has this to say about the most recent INTU stock earnings.</p>
      <blockquote>“This was a strong quarter across the company. We continue to make progress on our strategy of becoming an A.I.-driven expert platform. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 35 percent, exceeding our target to grow 30 percent or more.”</blockquote>
      <p>Despite the strong results, the Intuit earnings report includes a poor outlook for its fiscal second quarter of 2020. That includes adjusted earnings per share ranging from $1.00 to $1.03. This is below Wall Street’s estimate of $1.15 for the period.</p>
      <p>INTU stock was down slightly in after-hours trading on Thursday. The stock closed out the day down almost 1%. However, it’s up 40.63% since the start of the year.</p>
