      <p>The go-home show for <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">WWE NXT</a> before TakeOver: WarGames and Survivor Series kicked off with the return of RAW Women's Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/becky-lynch">Becky Lynch</a> to Full Sail University after almost four years. The Man had a few harsh words for NXT Champion <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/shayna-baszler">Shayna Baszler</a> and her fellow Horsewomen cronies and asked them to come out to the ring.</p>
      <p>Her challenge was instead met by <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rhea-ripley">Rhea Ripley</a> who came out to the ring and asked Lynch to prove how much of a man she is by backing it up inside the ring with her. Unfortunately for the first-ever NXT UK Women's Champion, her dream match with Lynch ended abruptly when The Queen of Spades along with Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir stormed the ring in an attempt to take down Lynch and Ripley. However, The Man and The Nightmare stood tall at the end after they drove all three MMA Horsewomen out of the ring.</p>
      <h3>The Man and The Nightmare's Twitter exchange</h3>
      <p>After the show concluded, Ripley took to Twitter to express that she wants to have another match with Lynch somewhere down the line.</p>

      <p>Lynch got back to Ripley with a cheeky statement by saying that Ripley must have felt nice to be in the ring with a real champion.</p>
