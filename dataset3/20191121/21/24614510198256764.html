      <h1>Dow Jones Today: Trade War and Split Retail Views Weigh on Stocks</h1>
      <h2>It was another day of modest losses, but Exxon Mobil remains a positive Dow story</h2>

      <p>It has been a familiar theme for several days now, but mixed messages on the trade front weighed on stocks Thursday, as did some diverging signals from retail earnings reports.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The <b>S&amp;P 500</b> lost 0.16%</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average</b> declined 0.20%</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>The <b>Nasdaq Composite</b> dropped 0.24%</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Exxon Mobil </b>(NYSE:<b><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/xom-stock-quote/"><u>XOM</u></a></b>), the largest domestic oil company, jumped 2.46%, making it the Dow’s best-performing name today</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As he’s prone to do, President Trump threw a curveball at the trade talks. Congress recently passed legislation backing the Hong Kong protesters, a group not in favor in Beijing, and the president is mulling signing that bill. That news comes as one of China’s trade negotiators expressed some optimism over the talks.</p>
      <p>To go along with the geopolitical issues, investors had to contend with the retail sector today. <b>Target</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tgt-stock-quote/"><b><u>TGT</u></b></a>), in modest fashion, followed through on yesterday’s post-earnings epic gain, but <b>Macy’s </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/m-stock-quote/"><b><u>M</u></b></a>) faltered after <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/macys-earnings-dip-m-stock/">revealing a gloomy outlook</a>. Neither stock is a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>
      <p>Overall, it was a day of split decisions and that much was reflected in 15 of the Dow’s 30 components being higher in late trading, while 15 were in the red.</p>
      <h3>Exxon Excellence</h3>
      <p>Oil giant Exxon has seen some play in this space this week and with good reason. As I noted yesterday, XOM stock traded higher, perhaps surprisingly so, after Moody’s Investors Service expressed concern <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/dow-jones-today-investors-desperate-for-a-trade-deal/">about the company’s ability</a> to conserve cash.</p>
      <p>Exxon, widely viewed as <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/exxon-is-a-solid-oil-name-but-it-may-awhile-before-it-rewards-investors/">a value/high dividend play</a>, may or may not have acknowledged those concerns from Moody’s, but the company did say today it’s looking to sell up to $25 billion of oil and gas fields in Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>
      <p>That $25 billion figure is well above the $15 billion in divestments the company was expected to do by the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>“The new plan would also see Exxon significantly pare back operations in Southeast Asia with the sale of its assets in Indonesia and Malaysia, the sources said,” <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-exxon-steps-assets-sales-144323602.html">according to <i>Reuters</i></a>. “In Africa, Exxon wants to sell its operations in Chad, Equatorial Guinea as well as parts of its Nigerian assets.”</p>
      <h3>Disney Again</h3>
      <p><b>Disney </b>(NYSE:<b><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/dis-stock-quote/"><u>DIS</u></a></b>) was one of the losers on the Dow Jones today, but that isn’t likely to be an ongoing condition. As was noted last week, the company’s new Disney + <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/disney-is-set-up-for-streaming-dominance-but-theres-more-to-like/">streaming service signed up 10 million</a> subscribers on its first day.</p>
      <p>Many came by way of <b>Verizon </b>(NYSE:<b><a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/vz-stock-quote/"><u>VZ</u></a></b>), giving the service away for free to its customers for a year. Disney hasn’t commented on exactly how many of the 10 million are actually paying for Disney + right now.</p>
      <p>Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger isn’t getting caught up in that speculation and raised his price target on Disney shares to $137 from $130 today.</p>
      <p>“In the very extreme case, one could go so far as to argue that, basically, everybody who will ever be interested in signing up for Disney+ will do so in the first couple of years (which would be a massive initial burst of subscribers),” <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/what-do-disney-10-million-subscribers-really-mean-51574357615?mod=hp_LEAD_2">he said in a note cited by <i>Barron’s</i></a><i>.</i></p>
      <p>For those long Disney stock wanting more near-term catalysts, <i>Frozen 2</i> debuts tomorrow, potentially representing another box office smash for the company.</p>
      <h3>Rare Microsoft Miss</h3>
      <p>Fortunately, I’m not talking about <b>Microsoft </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/"><b><u>MSFT</u></b></a>) missing earnings or revenue targets. However, the company did say today that the launch of its new Surface Earbuds will be postponed until spring 2020.</p>
      <p>That means the product won’t be available for the holiday shopping season. That’s definitely a missed opportunity and one that’s good news for <b>Apple </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/aapl-stock-quote/"><b><u>AAPL</u></b></a>), the dominant name in the wireless in-ear audio market.</p>
      <p>Shares of Microsoft traded slightly lower on the news.</p>
      <h3>Bottom Line on the Dow Jones Today</h3>
      <p>The past couple of days haven’t been great for stocks, but the losses haven’t been alarming, either, suggesting the environment could still be ripe for some risk taking.</p>
      <p>“Putting it all together, we are becoming increasingly comfortable with incremental risk positioning during the fourth quarter,” <a href="https://www.blackrockblog.com/2019/11/20/investors-prepare-for-greater-dispersion/">said <i>BlackRock</i> in a note out earlier today</a>. “Specifically, we like upside equity convexity, relative to pervasive negative sentiment, and think that corporate buybacks are still so powerful.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.</i>
