        <b>Gardaí have said over 600 motor insurance policies will be cancelled as a result of insurance fraud.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They are carrying out a "comprehensive investigation" into insurance fraud through so-called ghost brokering.</p>
      <p>It is liaising with the Insurance Federation of Ireland, and numerous insurance companies.</p>
      <p>It said any person with concerns about the credentials of their insurance policy should contact their insurance company directly and verify if their motor insurance is valid.</p>
      <p>It said as a result of operations over the past number of months, more than 600 motor insurance policies will now be cancelled.</p>
      <p>It comes after a group representing brokers in Ireland called on consumers to be more alert to the dangers of fraudsters.</p>
      <p>Brokers Ireland said people should remember if an insurance quote seems too good to be true, it almost certainly is.</p>
      <p>The organisation, which represents 1,250 brokers registered with and regulated by the Central Bank, also called on consumers to always check the authenticity of any person or company selling or administering insurance policies.</p>
      <p>Cathie Shannon is the director of general insurance at Brokers Ireland.</p>
      <p>She said that this can be done with relative ease.</p>

      <p>"The easiest and cost-free first step would be to check the Brokers Ireland website: brokersireland.ie because all our insurance brokers are listed there.</p>
      <p>"Our website has a handy search facility, which will also enable a consumer to find an insurance broker in their local area.</p>
      <p>"Second, consumers can also check with the Central Bank, the website of which provides a search facility to enable consumers check whether the person or company purporting to sell insurance or administer policies is a regulated entity."</p>
      <p>Ms Shannon said anyone who purchases insurance from a fraudster has not actually purchased a valid insurance policy.</p>
      <p>"In the event you need to make a claim, the consequences of being left without insurance cover can be catastrophic."</p>
      <p>Those who purchase car insurance from a fraudster will be driving without insurance, which is a criminal offence.</p>
      <p>"What makes matters worse is that they are often targeting young or vulnerable consumers, often foreign nationals who are not clear on how the insurance market works in Ireland," she said.</p>
      <p>"While conducting business over the web is now the norm, the web is also a great marketplace for fraudsters.</p>
      <p>"Consumers need to be alert at all times. Think twice before purchasing insurance from sources such as social media sites and carefully check any insurance documentation for accuracy," Ms Shannon added.</p>
