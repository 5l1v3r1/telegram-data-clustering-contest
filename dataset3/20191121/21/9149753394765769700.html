      <h1>This 144Hz FreeSync monitor from LG is just $130 today only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:42:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>If you're on the hunt for a new <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-gaming-monitor/">gaming monitor</a>, you might not have to wait until <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/black-friday-deals-2019-gaming/">Black Friday</a>. One of LG's 144Hz screens is just $129.99 right now from B&amp;H Photo, a 48% savings from the original MSRP, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-Ultragear-24GL600F-B-FreeSync-Technology/dp/B07NHSJ1RF">$20 cheaper than the current Amazon price</a>.</p>
      <p>The specs on this monitor include a 23.6-inch LCD screen, a 1080p resolution (93 ppi), a matte finish, and a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz with AMD FreeSync. It's not compatible with HDR, and it also uses a Twisted Nematic (TN) panel instead of a nicer IPS or *VA screen, but both of those are expected trade-offs at this price.</p>
      <p>This display isn't on the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/">official list of G-Sync compatible monitors</a>, though I was able to find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LIWGP95ILI3X/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B07NHSJ1RF">one report</a> that manually enabling G-Sync mode works well. Your mileage my vary.</p>
