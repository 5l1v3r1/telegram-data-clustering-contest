      <p>Gearbox is adding an extra tough way for people to play <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/borderlands-3/40522"><i>Borderlands 3</i></a> — Mayhem 4 — plus a bunch more bank slots, something fans will be excited about.</p>
      <p>The new way to play, added in a Nov. 21 patch, increases enemy health to make the game a lot tougher. In exchange, players can earn better rewards, like “a new set of Legendaries,” <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-21-borderlands-3-patch-hotfixes-nov-21/">Gearbox said</a> in its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/9/20852642/borderlands-3-review-pc-ps4-xbox-one"><i>Borderlands 3</i></a> patch notes. Players can earn new Legendary weapons and class mods that Gearbox said “will contribute to new builds and new ways to kill enemies.”</p>
      <p>Mayhem 1-3 remain unchanged, but Mayhem stations are slightly different. “Players will activate Mayhem through the center pillar and increase or decrease Mayhem levels by using the pillars on each side,” Gearbox said. The developer said it’ll monitor Mayhem 4 “closely” ahead of Mayhem 2.0, which “will add brand new gameplay additions to Mayhem Mode in the future.”</p>
      <p>Likewise, <i>Borderlands 3</i> is getting new content in the form of Takedown at the Maliwan Blacksite, where players will have to “destroy a top-secret weapon Maliwan has been developing at their Blacksite.” It’s a level-50 challenge for four players, and it can be accessed on Sanctuary III after beating the game.</p>
      <p>It’s a mode that has “special rules not found in the rest of the game,” like respawn being disabled. “If you do die, you’re not out permanently! Die during the first half, you’ll get to rejoin your team if they defeat the Valkyrie Squad,” Gearbox said. “If you’re out the second half, but your team manages to defeat Wotan The Invincible, you’ll get to respawn to enjoy the rewards you didn’t completely earn!”</p>
      <p>Players are probably excited to hear that <i>Borderlands 3</i>’s latest patch increases bank slots — existing Bank SDUs will give a total of 100 spaces, with “an additional 10 Bank SDUs” available in Marcus’ Sanctuary III shop. (Likewise, all characters will start with 20 bank slots instead of 10 now.) If you’re not keeping count, that means a total of 300 bank spaces to keep all your precious stuff.</p>
      <p>Lastly, Gearbox adjusted balance for character in the endgame. Here are the notes, straight from the developer:</p>
