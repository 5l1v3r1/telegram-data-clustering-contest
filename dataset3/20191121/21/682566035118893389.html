      <p>Milan - Italian club<b> Verona's</b> partial one-match stadium closure for racist chants directed at Brescia striker <b>Mario Balotelli </b>in a Serie A game earlier this month was suspended on appeal Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Italian Football Federation's (FIGC) disciplinary commission had ordered Verona to host Fiorentina on Sunday with the "Poltrone Est" section of their Bentegodi Stadium closed.</p>
      <p>It followed racist chanting directed towards Italian international Balotelli during his team's 2-1 defeat on November 3 in Verona.</p>
      <p>Despite denials of abuse from Verona, a video published on Twitter by a fan showed a number of supporters abusing Balotelli before the forward kicked the ball at them in the stands and threatened to walk off the pitch.</p>
      <p>But the FIGC's appeals court on Thursday said they had suspended the sanction, pending further investigation.</p>
      <p>"We are satisfied, we have highlighted various inconsistencies and we look forward to the outcome of the investigation, naturally hoping for a final favourable decision," said Verona's Operations Director Francesco Barresi, adding that it had been "an absolute injustice to blame an entire sector".</p>
      <p>"We are waiting for all our fans on Sunday at the stadium with the additional support of almost 1,000 children from the School Project, as has happened on previous occasions.</p>
      <p>"These little fans will be present with banners and slogans against all discrimination."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Balotelli was sent home from training on Thursday after a bust-up with new Brescia coach Fabio Grosso, according to reports in Italy.</p>
      <p>Ex-World Cup winner Grosso, who took over after Eugenio Corini was sacked following the defeat by Verona, was reportedly angered by Balotelli's lazy start to training.</p>
      <p>Balotelli headed straight for the dressing room, before driving away from the training centre, Gazzetta Dello Sport reported.</p>
      <p>Brescia are bottom of the Serie A table and travel to Roma on Sunday looking for their first win in two months.</p>
