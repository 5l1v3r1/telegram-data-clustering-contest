      <h1>The Bella Twins Want To Return To The WWE!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:30:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Nikki Bella was stopped in her tracks when she was forced to retire from the WWE due to injury. Meanwhile, Brie Bella voluntarily bowed out in order to have a second baby.</p>
      <p>It turns out that the twins are thinking seriously about a comeback. The women’s division of the WWE is doing things bigger than they’ve ever done before.</p>
      <p>The women’s revolution that was introduced just a few years ago was spearheaded by the Bella Twins and other female wrestlers that have caused the company to revamp the way they treat the girls of the WWE.</p>
      <p>From the word ‘Divas’ being removed from the championship titles to the first all women’s pay-per-view event — the wrestling brand isn’t what it used to be ten or even five years ago.</p>

      <p>That’s actually a great thing and is what Brie and Nikki stood for during their time on Raw and Smackdown. Now they want to properly be a part of it but there’s one thing standing in their way: Brie’s desire for baby number two.</p>
      <p>During the last episode of Total Divas, the mother of one told her sister: ‘I feel like, our whole career, you and I always wanted the tag titles.’</p>
      <p>To which Nikki responded: ‘I would love to be, at least once in my life, a tag team champion with you. They just really want us to help make the tag team championships mean something. Retirement in the WWE means you have a great story when you come out of it.’</p>
      <p>Brie seemingly wanted to say yes but explained that she has to speak to her husband, Bryan Danielson, before committing.</p>
      <p>‘I also have to think about Bryan, because I have been trying for a baby. My husband is super excited. So, if he says no because of trying for baby number two, I’m gonna respect that.’</p>
      <p>Do you think the twins can pull off a comeback?</p>
