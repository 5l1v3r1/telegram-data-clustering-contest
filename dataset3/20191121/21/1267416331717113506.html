      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:02:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Fizz has confirmed to <i>MobileSyrup</i> that the telecommunications company has lowered the price of its 1GB, 2GB and 4GB mobile plans.</p>
      <p>The company sent out emails to customers on November 21st notifying them of the change in prices.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FizzMobile/comments/dzmlsx/fizz_lowered_the_price_on_some_plans/">user on Reddit</a> shared an email he received from the telecommunications company noting that the 1GB Canada-wide plan has been reduced from $30 per month to $26 per month.</p>
      <p>Another user noted that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FizzMobile/comments/dzmlsx/fizz_lowered_the_price_on_some_plans/">4GB plan has been reduced</a> from $44 per month to $37 per month.</p>

      <p>The email notes that the price change is subject to go in effect on November 22nd and that the cost has already been updated in customers’ account.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that it seems that the price has not changed for customers who are on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FizzMobile/comments/dzmlsx/fizz_lowered_the_price_on_some_plans/">beta or stabilization</a> pricing.</p>
