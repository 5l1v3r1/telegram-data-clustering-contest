      <p>If you can get past the lack of a full-frame sensor, the <a href="https://www.adorama.com/ifjxt3b.html?kbid=67085">Fujifilm X-T3</a> and <a href="https://www.adorama.com/isoa6600.html?kbid=67085">Sony a6600</a> are two of the most compelling and full-featured mirrorless cameras on the market today. So while everyone is arguing over full-frame mirrorless, <a href="https://theslantedlens.com/2019/fujifilm-x-t3-vs-sony-a6600/">The Slanted Lens</a> decided to do a little APS-C shootout to see which of these cameras is the better performer.</p>
      <p>Right off the bat, it’s worth noting that both of these cameras sell for between $1,300 and $1,500 for the body-only depending on the sale you happen to run across, so price is more-or-less the same. Of course, that doesn’t mean that there’s no difference in terms of performance, and therefore value.</p>
      <p>That’s why Jay P Morgan and Kenneth Merrill put both cameras through a series of tests to see which performed best in terms of: overall image quality, autofocus, dynamic range, ISO, video quality, and ergonomics &amp; usability.</p>

      <p>We don’t want to give away the farm—there’s <a href="https://theslantedlens.com/2019/fujifilm-x-t3-vs-sony-a6600/">a good written overview</a> over at <i>The Slanted Lens</i> website if you prefer that to video—but the conclusion goes something like this:</p>
      <p>In most categories, these cameras are neck and neck. Fuji’s colors SOOC are just a bit more pleasing, Sony (unsurprisingly) edges out a win in autofocus tracking, Sony wins the dynamic range shootout for stills but looses the same comparison when shooting video, and they’re neck and neck in terms of high ISO performance.</p>
      <p>Ergonomics is really a matter of preference between the Fuji’s retro looks and beefier grip and the Sony’s modern aesthetic and smaller form factor.</p>
      <p>Check out the full comparison up top or <a href="https://theslantedlens.com/2019/fujifilm-x-t3-vs-sony-a6600/">on the Slanted Lens website</a> to see the results for yourself. In the end, you really can’t go wrong with either of these systems. When it comes to video, the Fuji should be your pick hands down, but if you’re primarily a stills shooter (like most of our readers) you’ll want to pick the one that best suits your hands and your workflow.</p>
