      <h1>Frank Ntilikina’s new ‘f–k it’ attitude behind resurgence for Knicks</h1>

      <p>About that infamous French meeting.</p>
      <p>Last week, Knicks coach David Fizdale revealed French point guard Frank Ntilikina came into his office a few weeks ago and stated he wants also to be known as “<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/knicks-frank-ntilikina-shows-hes-a-dog-in-best-way-possible/">a dog</a>’’ – a familiar phrase characterizing many of the 2019-20 Knicks’ new players.</p>
      <p>Fizdale said there was more to their talk. It’s been evident in Ntilikina’s play — <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/knicks-blow-big-second-half-lead-in-loss-to-76ers/">underscored Wednesday night</a>. The once-hesitant Ntilikina looked free as an eagle in Philadelphia, dancing into pick-and-rolls, firing up clean shots from mid-range and the 3-point line.</p>
      <p>When a reporter asked Fizdale after the game, point-blank, if Ntilkina just doesn’t give a f–k anymore, the Knicks coach smiled.</p>
      <p>“I told you about the meeting we had,’’ Fizdale said. “It was basically: “F it.’’ I’m not going to be worried about all that stuff anymore. I think he’s cut back on what he’s reading and helped him keep a clear head. I like the way he’s managing the game and going about attacking.’’</p>
      <p>He was 6-of-8 from the field and – lo and behold – his shooting percentage is now up to 40 percent. Last season, Ntilikina heard his name being bandied about on the trading block, even on draft night in June.</p>

      <p>His sound play for France at the World Cup helped his confidence this summer. Now any uptick in offense for Ntilikina, who is averaging 6.1 points, is cause for celebration for his cult following, who would like to see a statue in French marble erected after any double-figure scoring outing.</p>
      <p>Ntilikina posted 17 points in the Sixers loss, one below his career high. He’s shooting 33.7 percent from 3, which is below the NBA average but not by much.</p>
      <p>“He’s getting <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/frank-ntilikinas-long-awaited-knicks-rise-has-massive-impact/">better, better and better</a>,’’ Fizdale said. “More confident. We’ve gone through so much noise, he and I together. I’m just so proud of him with the way he’s handled everything and now he’s just not even thinking about it. I think you can see that he’s just out there playing and having fun. All of the team, we just have a lot of confidence in him.”</p>
      <p>It was only a little more than three weeks ago in Orlando when Fizdale <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/frank-ntilikina-is-knicks-only-point-guard-hope-for-now/">refused to start Ntilkina</a> even though every single point guard on the roster was unavailable — Elfrid Payton (hamstring), Dennis Smith Jr. (family leave), Kadeem Allen (knee). Fizdale started RJ Barrett at the point instead and inserted Wayne Ellington, who has since fallen off the map, as starting shooting guard.</p>
      <p>When the Knicks resume play vs. San Antonio Saturday, Ntilikina will make his 10th straight start. Maybe the $6.3M rookie-contract option the Knicks exercised in October for next season settled his mind.</p>
      <p>“(I’m just) working the game, getting easy shots and taking what the defense gives to us,’’ Ntilikina said. “We felt more comfortable moving the ball and that’s the work that we’ve put in since training camp.’’</p>
      <p>Ntilikina’s value as a defender and ball-mover is evident, perhaps amplified by how the club looks when he’s not on the floor. Wednesday, the Knicks blew a 17-point late third-quarter lead – much of it frittered away when Ntilikina was on the bench for Dennis Smith Jr.</p>
      <p>The 4-11 Knicks are a minus-0.6 when he’s on the court per game. When the Frenchman is off the court, the Knicks are minus-6.3 per game.</p>
