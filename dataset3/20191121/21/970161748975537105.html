      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! viewers were left in hysterics after Andrew Whyment fangirled over the show.</p>
      <p>The Coronation Street star couldn’t believe his luck as he got to watch his fellow campmate Cliff Parisi take part in a Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>And while he looked on from afar and cheered his newfound friend on, the 38-year-old had a pinch-me moment as he joked it was like being in front of the television.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t help it, sorry Cliff,’ he said while trying to control his laughter: ‘It’s just making me laugh, I feel like I’m watching the TV at home.’</p>
      <p>As Andrew was giggling away in the sidelines, the EastEnders actor had to put his hand into covered boxes in order to retrieve a number of stars for the original group.</p>

      <p>Each box was full of either critters, creepy crawlies and reptiles with others loaded with fish guts.</p>

      <p>Poking his hand in one, the 59-year-old squirmed: ‘What’s in here, whatever it is it’s dead.’</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec called over: ‘Fish guts,’ which set Andrew off again.</p>
      <p>Laughing along with the hosts, he mimicked their words as he splurted out: ‘Fish guts!’</p>
      <p>Once the trial was over, Dec explained Andrew’s reaction to Cliff, and said: ‘He thought he was back on the sofa watching the telly!’</p>

      <p>He then asked the pair: ‘How do you feel after your first experience in the jungle?’</p>
      <p>And to no surprise, Andrew said with a huge grin on his face: ‘I loved it. Eight stars, I’m very happy, I think the camp will eat well, so I’m alright with that.’</p>
      <p>Viewers at home were quick to take to Twitter where they were left in stitches as the newcomer.</p>
      <p>‘I love Andy, he’s loving life,’ one wrote while another added: ‘Hahahaha Kirk got a front-row seat to his favourite show.’</p>
      <p>Someone else said: ‘Andy having a fangirl moment through this trial… laughing his head off and then “I love this show!”‘</p>
