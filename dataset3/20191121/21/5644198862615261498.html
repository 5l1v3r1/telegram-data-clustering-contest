      <p>Daimler plans to sell luxury Maybach brand's first sport-utility vehicle, its China chief executive, Hubertus Troska, said on Thursday, joining other luxury brands that offer SUV models to attract customers from China and the United States.</p>
      <p>GUANGZHOU, China/SHANGHAI: Daimler plans to sell luxury Maybach brand's first sport-utility vehicle, its China chief executive, Hubertus Troska, said on Thursday, joining other luxury brands that offer SUV models to attract customers from China and the United States.</p>
      <p>Daimler plans to roll out the Mercedes-Maybach GLS model, which is based on the Mercedes GLS-Class SUV, in the second half of 2020, Troska said, adding China is Mercedes-Maybach’s biggest market.</p>

      <p>The move comes one day after James Bond's carmaker of choice, Aston Martin , rolled out its first SUV model, the DBX. Luxury carmakers from Rolls-Royce to Lamborghini launched ultra-luxury SUV models in the past year to boost their brand's overall profitability.</p>
      <p>In 2012, Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz brand, stopped making Maybach's iconic long limousines after the vehicles, which were based on a unique design and cost around US$380,000, failed to sell heavily enough.</p>
      <p>At the time, Maybach vehicles were marketed as a separate brand from Mercedes-Benz. Among the owners were oligarchs, rap stars, and royals including Russia’s Roman Abramovich, musician Jay-Z and King Juan Carlos of Spain.</p>
      <p>When the joint Mercedes-Maybach brand was launched in 2014, Ola Kaellenius, then the Mercedes-Benz executive responsible for marketing and sales, said the brand was expected to sell well in China, the United States, Russia and Japan.</p>
      <p>At the Shanghai autoshow this year, Daimler's Troska said demand for Maybachs was more than 600 a month in China.</p>
