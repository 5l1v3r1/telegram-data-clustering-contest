      <h1>Why reports on whistle blowing dropped — FG</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:21:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:21</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Mohammed Dikwa, the Permanent Secretary, Special Duties in the Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning says there has been a reduction in reported cases of whistle blowing due to some challenges.</p>
      <p>Dikwa said this at a national workshop to discuss the draft bill of the whistle blowing policy in Abuja on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He explained that some people that wanted to blow whistle were no longer comfortable with the new arrangement put in place.</p>
      <p>According to him, the arrangement entails one fills forms as part of process to document their claims.</p>
      <p>He said that lack of legislation was also a major challenge hindering the success of the policy.</p>
      <p>Dikwa said that improper coordination among stakeholders was a major problem confronting the policy.</p>
      <p>“The reported cases of whistle blowing or the tips used to come frequently on daily basis when we just introduced it in November, 2016.</p>
      <p>“When we started, we received 2,000 reported cases monthly but it has gone down drastically.</p>
      <p>“We have instituted some measures to avoid situation where people will come and give false information and go with it.</p>
      <p>“With what we are putting in place now, we will make sure anyone that gives information that has to do with recovery of money is rewarded.</p>
      <p>“The same measure will ensure that those who give fake information to undermine anybody are duly punished,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dikwa expressed the determination of the present government to give the policy a legislative backing for smooth implementation.</p>
      <p>He said the aim of the workshop was to discuss with relevant stakeholders on the draft bill on the policy.</p>
      <p>Dikwa said that the step was taken to have a bill that would be acceptable by all and sundry.</p>
      <p>The permanent secretary disclosed that between 2016 and 2018, N594.08 billion had been saved by the government from tips, adding that 50,000 ghost workers were removed from payroll.</p>
      <p>He said within the period under review, 800 staff involved in collection of double salaries and 400 personnel who left civil service and still collecting salaries for two years were discovered. </p>
