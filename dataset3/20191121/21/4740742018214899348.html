      <h1>The 11 big issues in Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party manifesto</h1>
      <h2>The Labour party will increase pay for public sectors workers and will tax oil and gas giants to tackle climate change</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:30:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Bristol Post</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn launched the Labour party's manifesto in Birmingham today (November 21), in which the leader made big promises on climate change, nationalisation and pay.</p>
      <p>The leader insisted that the programme, called 'It's time for real change" was fully costed and would not result in tax increases for 95 per cent of the population.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the most eye-catching proposals in the manifesto.</p>
      <h3>1. Environment</h3>
      <p>Labour will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies, which it says will go towards covering the costs of climate change.</p>
      <p>It will also create a National Transformation Fund of £400 billion to meet environmental targets. £250 billion of this will go towards transitioning to a green economy through renewable and low-carbon energy and transport, biodiversity and environmental restoration.</p>
      <p>The fund will provide an expected £11 billion support package for nearly 37,000 oil and gas workers, the 126,000 people in jobs dependent on the sector and their communities to make the transition to a clean economy, Labour says.</p>
      <p>A National Investment Bank will provide £250 billion of lending for enterprise, infrastructure and innovation over 10 years.</p>
      <h3>2. Workers' rights</h3>
      <p>Labour has unveiled a package of measures in its manifesto designed to bolster workers rights, including the "rapid" introduction of the real living wage, which would be set at £10 an hour for workers aged 16 and over.</p>
      <p>The party would also cut the working week to 32 hours, or four days per week, within the decade, with no loss of pay. Four new bank holidays would be introduced and controversial zero-hours contracts would be banned. </p>
      <p>These measures would be overseen by a Ministry of Employment Rights, with the relevant minister able to attend top meetings at Cabinet. </p>
      <p>In a swipe at the gig economy, workers will be given full employment rights on the first day of their job and acquire the stats of "worker" to end what Labour calls "bogus" self-employment, a reference to recent claims by the likes of Uber and Deliveroo that it's workers are self-employed and therefore not entitled to features such as holiday and sick pay.</p>
      <p>Labour also says it would repeal "anti-trade union" legislation under the Tories and roll out collective bargaining across the country. This would allow there to be legal minimum standards on pay and hours, Labour says. </p>
      <h3>3. Pay rise for workers </h3>
      <p>The party will increase pay for public sector workers by five per cent.</p>
      <p>"Our most valuable assets are the dedicated people who work in our public services, but under this government their pay has been cut in real terms," the manifesto read. "Labour will restore public sector pay to at least pre-financial crisis levels (in real terms), by delivering year-on-year above-inflation pay rises, starting with a five per increase, to reward and retain the people who do so much for us all."</p>
      <p>The breakdown for pay rises is as follows:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Newly qualified nurses: more than £1,200</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Firefighters: more than £1,800 on average</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Teachers in state-funded schools: almost £2,000 on average</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Junior doctors: almost £1,400</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Police constables: almost £2,000</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Army sergeants: more than £1,700</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Civil servants: more than £1,300 on average</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Council workers: more than £1,200 on average</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4. Health and social care</h3>
      <p>More money will be pumped into the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> under Labour, according to its manifesto.</p>
      <p>The budget for the health service will rise by 4.3 per cent on average per year, which according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, would amount to an additional £3.2 billion in real terms over four years (£3.5 billion in cash terms), reaching £143.5 billion in 2023/24.</p>
      <p>The party says it will reverse privatisation in the health service. </p>
      <p>On social care, there will be a "lifetime cap" on the amount people have to pay for social care, while free personal care for those aged over 65 will be provided, with the ambition to extend this provision to all "working-age adults" who need it.</p>
      <p>Carers will see an increase in their allowance while those being cared should experience longer visits from staff, as Labour end 15-minute visits.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> would also introduce free annual dental check-ups and free prescriptions across England. Car park charges for patients, staff and visitors will be scrapped</p>

      <h3>5. Housing</h3>
      <p>Labour has promised to tackle the housing crisis by building 100,000 council homes a year by the end of its first parliament. A further 50,000 that Labour describes as "genuinely affordable" would be built each year through housing associations.</p>
      <p>Councils would be given powers and funding to buy back homes from private landlords, and Right to Buy, which allows council tenants to buy their homes at a discount, would go.</p>
      <p>Labour has also proposed to introduce rent caps to control "runaway rents". Rent would be capped in line with inflation and cities would be handed powers to cap them further if they thought necessary.</p>
      <p>Renters' rights would be bolstered thought a new union. </p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/homelessness">homelessness</a> would be tackled through a tax on second homes used as holiday homes. </p>
      <p>New "renters' unions" will be created for tenants to defend their rights under a Labour government as the party cracks down on rogue landlords, who would receive "tougher sanctions" for breaking rules. </p>
      <h3>6. Education and childcare</h3>
      <p>Labour would scrap tuition fees, currently set at £9,000 per year, but it would not write off all existing student debt. It would also bring back maintenance grants.</p>
      <p>Schools in England would see a spending boost of £10.5 billion by 2022/23, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies said translates into a 15 per cent real terms increase per pupil over the next three years.</p>
      <p>The party has also imposed a class size of 30 in schools and teachers will be funded for "non contact" time for preparing and planning lessons. </p>
      <p>Labour has also pledged in its manifesto to cut tax breaks for private schools. </p>
      <p>"We will close the tax loopholes enjoyed by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children, and we will ask the Social Justice Commission to advise on integrating private schools and creating a comprehensive education system," it said, leaving the door open to a ban on private schools all together. </p>
      <h3>7. Crime </h3>
      <p>The manifesto says Labour would hire 2,000 more frontline police officers that the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Tories</a>, while the number of prison officers would be restored to 2010 levels. Private sector contracts to run jails would be brought to an end. </p>
      <p>The party has also vowed to reverse cuts to legal aid and the courts, as well as bring in "hundreds of community lawyers".</p>
      <p>Neighbourhood policing would be brought back and a Royal Commission would be convened on substance abuse to focus on harm reduction. </p>
      <p>Legal aid and court cuts would be reversed and "hundreds of community lawyers" would be recruited under Labour, the document adds. </p>
      <p>Labour is sceptical against short prison sentences.</p>
      <p>"We will set new standards for community sentences and introduce a presumption against prison sentences of six months or less for non-violent and non-sexual offences," it said in the manifesto. </p>
      <h3>8. Welfare </h3>
      <p>Universal Credit, the scheme that was brought in by the Tories to try to simplify the benefits system, would be scrapped and Labour would create its own system. </p>
      <p>The two-child limit for benefits and the welfare cap would also be scrapped. </p>
      <p>Labour said it would also introduce a "right to food" to end "food bank Britain", pledging to halve their usage within a year and remove the need for them altogether in three years. </p>
      <p>The party said it would stop "dehumanising" work capability and personal independence payment assessments for those with a disability and the retirement age would not be raised beyond 66.</p>
      <h3>9. Nationalisation </h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Labour will extend the remit of the state hugely if it wins power. </p>
      <p>Rail, mail, water and energy would be brought back into public ownership while the party would also deliver full-fibre broadband to everyone in the country. </p>
      <h3>10. Brexit</h3>
      <p>Labour says it will get <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> sorted in six months by giving people the final say in a second referendum, with a choice between a "sensible leave deal or remain". It will implement the result of the decision, which will be legally binding. </p>
      <p>The party is ambiguous on free movement. If the UK remains in the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/european-union">EU</a>, freedom of movement would continue. If it leaves, it will be "subject to negotiations",  the manifesto reads. Labour goes on to say that it recognises the "social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad – and we will seek to protect those rights" </p>
      <h3>11. Tax</h3>
      <p>The manifesto outlines plans to review business rates, which could result in an extra tax on property landlords to protect UK high streets. </p>
      <p>Labour will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies, which it says will go towards covering the costs of climate change. </p>
      <p>Labour will raise corporation tax - currently due to fall to 17 per cent next April - to 21 per cent from April 2020, 24 per cent from April 2021 and 26 per cent from April 2022. </p>
      <p>Small businesses with a turnover of less than £300,000 a year will face a 21 per cent corporation tax rate by 2022.</p>
