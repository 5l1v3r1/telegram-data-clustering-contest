      <p>Dead Cells was announced as part of the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/dead-cells?hmb_source=search_bar">new Humble Fall Sale</a> on November 21, 2019.

The game doesn’t show any sign of slowing down anytime soon, and as long as the fans continue to play, it will likely stay that way.</p>
