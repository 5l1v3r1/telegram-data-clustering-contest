      <p>Locals are fuming over their town council’s plans to sell a medieval copy of the Magna Carta.</p>
      <p>The charter of rights is just one of seven in existence and was presented to the Kent town of Faversham in 1300.</p>
      <p>After caring for the document for more than 700 years, Faversham Town Council have revealed plans to sell the manuscript, which was signed and sealed by King Edward I.</p>
      <p>The precious document is worth an estimated £20m and could be sold to fund refurbishing the council officers or an exhibition space, town leaders say,</p>
      <p>The announcement has been branded ‘outrageous’ by locals who are keen to preserve the town’s history.</p>
      <p>Former journalist Mark Gardner said it was an act of of ‘incredible irresponsibility’ to ‘sell the town’s birth right’.</p>
      <p>The 80-year-old said it was something that ‘should be and is prized by all of Faversham’s residents.’</p>

      <p>The Magna Carta, first issued in 1215, was a charter of rights agreed to by King John of England, as a peace treaty between him and rebel barons.</p>

      <p>Its core principle said no one was above the law – including the King.</p>
      <p>The Faversham copy is held in a vault and has only been put on display on a number of occasions.</p>
      <p>The town council has confirmed that if the precious charter cannot be permanently displayed in Faversham, other options – such as selling or leasing it to museums – will be considered.</p>
      <p>The revelation came as part of a consultation into the future use of the Faversham’s Town Hall.</p>
      <p>The council purchased the building in 2016 and planned to create a permanent exhibition space for the Magna Carta and Faversham’s other historic charters.</p>
      <p>However, the cash-strapped council have struggled to find grant money to put the document safely on display.</p>

      <p>Councillor Kris Barker said the authority is considering selling the document, as well as other options.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘The question about whether we want to sell the Magna Carta I think we need to defer until after we’ve made a proposal about what we’re going to do with this building.</p>
      <p>‘I think it’s a very valid question. There are also very similar options where we lease it to places like the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
      <p>‘I think we could explore all of those, but we would need to engage the town with what we’d end up doing with it, but at the moment I just think it’s worth making sure we run through these options, and if this isn’t a space we utilise for historic exhibitions and the display of Magna Carta, then we can look at other options.’</p>

      <p>Two copies of Magna Carta – both from 1297 – have been sold.</p>
      <p>One was bought by the Australian government for £12,500 and the other was sold to US businessman David Rubenstein for $21.3 million in 2007.</p>
