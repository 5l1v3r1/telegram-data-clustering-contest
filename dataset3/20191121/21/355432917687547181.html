      <h1>Maloney says Hill endured 'epic mansplaining' from GOP lawmaker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:11:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) told Fiona Hill, the former National Security Council senior director for Europe and Russia, that Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/michael-turner">Mike Turner</a>’s (R-Ohio) “epic mansplaining” was inappropriate.</p>
      <p>“Dr. Hill, first of all I thought that was some epic mansplaining that you were forced to endure by my colleague Mr. Turner and I want you to know some of us think it was inappropriate,” Maloney said Thursday during Hill’s public testimony as part of the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“But I appreciate your forbearance.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the hearing Turner had told Hill she provided “probably the greatest evidence before us to illustrate the problem with hearsay.”</p>
      <p>Turner called out Hill for her opening statement remarks in which she disputed Republican claims that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election.</p>
      <p>“You said based on questions and statements I have heard some of you on this committee — that’d be us — appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country,” Turner said, and then held up a report on Russian active measures that “was voted on by all of us.”</p>
      <p>“A little small, like, effort on your part Dr. Hill and you would've known that what you said was not true,” Turner added.</p>
      <p>Turner’s remarks during his time were not framed as a question and Hill did not respond.</p>
      <p>During her opening statement Hill said, “I have heard, some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia and its security services did not conduct a campaign against our country—and that perhaps, somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.”</p>
      <p>“This is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the Russian security services themselves,” she added. </p>
