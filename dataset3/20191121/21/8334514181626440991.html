        <figcaption><b>Billionaire Michael Bloomberg files paperwork to run for U.S. president<br/></b>Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Thursday to run for president of the United States as a Democrat, the latest sign he is joining the crowded Democratic field, after reportedly weighing a White House bid for weeks.

      <p>The filing allows Bloomberg to raise money in a bid for the White House, but an aide said on Thursday that no final decision on whether he will run has been made.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg, 77, has signaled that he plans a late-entry in the Democratic primary, suggesting he feels the field of nearly 20 candidates is vulnerable. If he enters, he will likely forgo the early states where potential rivals have been visiting for months.</p>
      <p>Bloomberg had already registered to appear on the ballot in Alabama, Arkansas and Texas.</p>
      <p>A separate advisor said on Thursday that Bloomberg also filed to be on the ballot in Georgia and Michigan.</p>
