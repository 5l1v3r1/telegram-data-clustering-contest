      <p>According to DailyTrust, the man took the action over Mohammed’s absenteeism from the UBE Primary School, Tunga in Minna, and refusal to attend Islamic school.</p>
      <p>According to Malam Abubakar, he took the action not with the intentions to torture his son but as a corrective measures because the son, Mohammed is fond of absconding from school and keeping late nights, adding that all efforts to correct and restrain Mohammed from wandering about failed.</p>
      <p>Malam Abubakar added that he only chained and locked Mohammed up on Wednesday morning after he went for the early morning prayers and did not see him in the mosque.</p>
      <blockquote>“<i>We looked for him everywhere but couldn’t find him. In fact, he apparently did not sleep at home; so I went to where they normally hang out with his friends and saw him sleeping.<br/></i><br/><i>I took him home and decided to use chain to prevent him from going anywhere until I returned from a naming ceremony but when I got back, I learnt some people from the human rights have taken him,” he explained.</i></blockquote>
