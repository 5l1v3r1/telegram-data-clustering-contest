      <p>Stephen A. Smith, the hot-take artist known for his sharp criticism of athletes, now finds himself under constant scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Smith is being criticized for his opinions of Colin Kaepernick’s workout Saturday, in which the former 49ers quarterback changed the location of the NFL-organized workout following a dispute over a liability waiver.</p>
      <p>Smith has railed against Kaepernick’s reasoning in recent days and one former player got under his skin on Thursday when he turned the discussion to race on “First Take.”</p>
      <p>Terrell Owens not only defended Kaepernick, the social-justice warrior some believe has been blackballed by the league, but said Smith’s co-host Max Kellerman seems “blacker” than Smith. Kellerman is white.</p>
      <p>“I’m in the streets, Max almost seems blacker than you Stephen A,” Owens said.</p>
      <p>Smith responded angrily, saying Owens “crossed the line” and believes Owens and others are trying to “bait” him. He said Owens asked to come on the show and wasn’t invited.</p>
      <p>Panthers safety Eric Reid, a confidant of Kaepernick’s, wrote on Twitter that Smith is “tap dancing for the NFL.” That led to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/espns-stephen-a-smith-eric-reid-feud-over-colin-kaepernick-workout/">Smith unloading on Reid on Twitter.</a></p>
      <p>Smith believes Kaepernick doesn’t really want to come back to the NFL and is more interested in being a martyr. That take has not been met kindly by backers of the quarterback.</p>
