      <h1>HBO may be sitting on a mysterious ‘Game of Thrones’ alternate ending</h1>

      <p>When you think about it, the alternate ending to <i>Game of Thrones</i> — the existence of which was confirmed by actor Kristofer Hivju, who played Free Folk raider Tormund Giantsbane — has something in common with the actual ending to the controversial final season of the HBO series: One of those endings was judged unworthy of being aired. And the ending that did end up on TV was criminally unworthy of the airing that it got.</p>
      <p>Hivju told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/">UK news outlet <i>Metro</i></a> that some number of <i>Thrones</i> actors actually ended up shooting an alternative conclusion to the final season (with the actual ending attracting so much criticism that more than 1.8 million people have signed a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/hbo-remake-game-of-thrones-season-8-with-competent-writers/u/24558787">Change.org petition</a> demanding that the season be re-shot with new writers). “That was mostly for fun,” Hivju said about the alternate ending, “but I don’t know if I’m allowed to tell you about that.”</p>
      <p>The fact that the series’ ending still engenders such intense reaction among fans, which runs the gamut from outright approval to regarding it as a massive dumpster fire, no doubt factored into HBO’s decision to keep the franchise alive by green-lighting a 10-episode prequel series, <i><a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/29/house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones-prequel/">House of the Dragon</a></i>. <i>Game of Thrones</i>‘ final season also helped bring in a record 32 Emmy Award nominations this year, including Emmys for “outstanding writing” for showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss (an award the pair didn’t end up winning).</p>
      <p>About the mysterious ending that was apparently shot and which we’ll no doubt never see, an HBO spokesman added a bit of extra intrigue when reached for comment by <i><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/entertainment/kristofer-hivju-got-ending/index.html">CNN</a></i>. Hivju, the spokesman speculated, may have been joking.</p>
      <p>One thing he apparently wasn’t joking about is his amazement at all the different theories that were circulating about how things would wrap up as the series drew to a close. “The funny thing is after Season 7, I had my theories, fans had theirs, everybody, the cast had their theories, so there were thousands of theories,” he told <i>Metro</i>. “To choose one path would be difficult to say but there were many things I didn’t see coming. There was the element of surprise, which I liked.”</p>
