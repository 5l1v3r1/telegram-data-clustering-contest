      <p>U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower on Thursday, as mixed signals on trade and a row between Washington and Beijing over the Hong Kong protests fanned concerns about the timing of a deal to end their prolonged tariff dispute.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: U.S. stock index futures were slightly lower on Thursday, as mixed signals on trade and a row between Washington and Beijing over the Hong Kong protests fanned concerns about the timing of a deal to end their prolonged tariff dispute.</p>
      <p>A report on Thursday said China had invited top U.S. trade negotiators for a new round of face-to-face talks in Beijing, soothing investor nerves after Reuters reported on Wednesday that the trade deal could slide into next year.</p>

      <p>A U.S. bill in support of Hong Kong, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law, also dulled the mood as China vowed strong measures to safeguard its sovereignty and security.</p>

      <p>Apple Inc , on the other hand, edged up 0.4per cent, as Trump said he was considering whether to exempt the iPhone maker from tariffs on imports from China.</p>
      <p>The next round of tariffs are due on Dec. 15 on Chinese goods, including holiday gift items such as electronics and Christmas decorations.</p>
      <p>At 7:27 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 26 points, or 0.09per cent. S&amp;P 500 e-minis were down 3 points, or 0.10per cent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 11.25 points, or 0.14per cent.</p>
