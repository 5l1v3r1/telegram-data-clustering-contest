      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut has withdrawn from the Davis Cup Finals after the death of his father on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bautista Agut played in Spain’s victories over Russia and Croatia but left the team and returned to Castellon after the health of his father Joaquin deteriorated.</p>
      <p>Bautista Agut, who reached this year’s Wimbledon semi-finals, lost his mother suddenly in 2018.</p>
      <p>Hosts Spain play Argentina on Friday at Madrid’s La Caja Magica for a place in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>Feliciano Lopez, Marcel Granollers and Pablo Carreno Busta are Spain’s other options to share the singles load with world number one Rafael Nadal.</p>
