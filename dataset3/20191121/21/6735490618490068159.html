      <p>The world was shocked when Cyrus was spotted making out with Brody Jenner’s ex Kaityln Carter, right after the announcement the “Malibu” singer’s split from Hemsworth after less than a year of marriage. Pataky, who is married to “Avengers: Endgame” star Chris Hemsworth, opened up to <a href="https://us.hola.com/celebrities/2019112130208/chris-hemsworth-elsa-pataky-liam-miley-cyrus-breakup/"><i>Hola!</i></a> magazine about the breakup.</p>

      <p>“My brother-in-law, well… After a relationship that you’ve dedicated ten years to, he’s a little bit down, but he’s coping well,” she shared. “He’s a strong boy and he deserves the best, I think he deserves much better.”</p>
      <p>Hemsworth and Cyrus were romantically involved as early as 2009. They met on the set of “The Last Song” and dated on-and-off for three years. In 2012, they announced their engagement before calling it off the next year.</p>

      <p>Cyrus confirmed in Oct. 2016 that they got re-engaged. The couple tied the knot on 23 December 2018 at their home in Nashville, Tennessee. Cyrus announced their separation on August 10 and Hemsworth filed for divorce 11 days later, citing irreconcilable differences.</p>
