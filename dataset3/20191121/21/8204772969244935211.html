      <h2>Departments of Health and Justice have agreed changes designed to address staffing crisis in out-of-hours GP services</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:08:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/paul-cullen-7.1837476" target="_blank">Paul Cullen</a></address>
      <p>The Departments of Health and Justice have agreed changes designed to address the staffing crisis in out-of-hours GP services. The loosening of regulations applying to many overseas locum doctors will make it easier for out-of-hours co-ops to hire GPs, particularly for night cover.</p>
      <p>The changes relate to the 2015 Atypical Working Scheme as it applies to locum doctors from outside the European Economic Area (EEA), and follows criticism from co-ops that the way the scheme was being enforced was discouraging locums from staying in the system.</p>
      <p>Minister for Justice <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Charlie+Flanagan">Charlie Flanagan</a> and Minister for Health <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Simon+Harris">Simon Harris</a> said the changes would make it possible for doctors to take up consecutive contracts and also to leave the State during their time working here.</p>
      <p>At present locums have to remain in Ireland for 90 consecutive days, and have to leave for 30 days before applying to work here again.</p>
      <p>Under the changes announced on Thursday the locums may reapply immediately after the 90-day period has elapsed, though they still have to be outside the State to do this.</p>
      <p>In addition, they will be allowed “intermittent” travel as part of their permission, up to a maximum of 14 days per period. This leave has to form part of their contract, and evidence of compliance will be required where a doctor seeks a second atypical permission with 12 months of the previous one.</p>
      <p>Mr Harris said the agreement would help to provide clarity around the obligations of non-EEA doctors without imposing “undue restrictions” on them.</p>
      <p>GP co-ops covering rural areas in particular have been struggling to recruit locum staff in recent months.</p>
