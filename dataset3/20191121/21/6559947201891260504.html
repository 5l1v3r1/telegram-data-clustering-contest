      <hr/>
      <p>The Simplehuman Sensor Mirror Hi-Fi does more than show your reflection. With a variety of customizable light settings, you can use an app on your phone to dial in exactly the right level of light for flawless makeup application. And it doubles as a surprisingly competent <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smart-home/92422/the-best-smart-speakers">smart speaker</a> with Amazon Alexa compatibility. It's an attractive addition to your vanity, though at $400, a very expensive one.</p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>The Sensor Mirror Hi-Fi has a sleek, modern design that's versatile enough to fit in with just about any bathroom or powder room decor. Both the base and back of the mirror are made of brushed stainless steel, while the mirror itself is glass with an aluminum coating. The base measures 9.1 inches wide and 4.1 inches high, and the mirror itself is 15 inches around.</p>
      <p>While the mirror itself is larger than the one I normally use, when combined with the base it's actually more compact than many other options out there. It doesn't take up a lot of space on my makeup table, even with tons of organizers and drawers surrounding it.</p>

      <p>Around the mirror is an LED light that ranges in brightness from 100 to 800 lux. In automatic mode, a sensor at the top triggers the lights whenever your face is near. In manual mode, you can touch the sensor to turn the light on and off. The right side of the mirror has a light control bar that allows you to adjust the brightness by swiping it with your finger.</p>

      <p>The base is also home to a speaker with a 2.5-inch acoustic driver, covered by gray fabric to match the mirror. The side holds controls to adjust volume and to play, pause, and skip songs. The back has a microphone on/off switch, a Bluetooth button, and an auxiliary audio port.</p>
      <h3>Setup and App</h3>
      <p>To connect the mirror to your phone, download the Simplehuman app (available for Android and iOS) and follow the prompts to create an account. Press the Bluetooth button on the back of the mirror until the app recognizes it, then connect it to your Wi-Fi network to complete the setup.</p>
      <p>Once it's connected, you can use the app to customize a variety of different settings. Tap on the mirror icon to register or remove it from your account, set up Amazon Alexa (Google Assistant isn't supported), and get access to documentation and video on how to use it.</p>

      <p>The sun icon gives you access to light settings, where you can adjust the color temperature. Depending on the environment you'll be in (or are currently in, if you prefer), you can choose from one of five presets: candlelight, sunlight, overcast, restaurant, or office. There's also the option to customize your own and save it in a list of presets. Underneath is a slider for brightness control, which you can adjust manually or set to automatic. A night shift mode triggers the candlelight setting at a certain time, which is ideal for your nighttime skincare routine, as the soft light won't wake you up before bed. You can create a custom schedule for it turn on and off at specific times.</p>
      <p>A sensor setting lets you choose whether you want the light to turn off after five, ten, or 30 seconds when it doesn't sense movement.</p>
      <p>There's also a button in the app for audio control. You can turn dynamic proximity audio on and off, as well as adjust the tone of the speaker including bass, mids, and treble.</p>
      <h3>A Better Morning Routine</h3>
      <p>While mornings are hectic, there's one part of my routine that never changes: listening to my favorite podcast while doing my makeup in front of the mirror. If the natural light in my room is good enough, I use my regular makeup mirror and listen on a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/google-home-mini/91458/review/google-home-mini">Google Home Mini</a>. If it's too dark, I use the bathroom mirror and my phone as the speaker.</p>
      <p>That said, I'm reluctant to use the mirror in the bathroom, since the bright vanity lights flush out my pale skin, resulting in makeup that can look overdone. The Simplehuman Sensor Mirror made this portion of my day a lot easier and more reliable, since the speaker is built in and the lighting is always perfect. Using the app, I tapped on the preset I made for specifically for my room. The light itself feels natural, and just right so that I can apply my makeup evenly, without feeling like it's too dark or too light.</p>

      <p>I also like that the mirror features up to 5x magnification. When you sit up close to it, you get a normal view of your face. The farther back you move, the more it magnifies a specific area. At full magnification, you can see everything, from minor blemishes to flakes of dry skin and even clogged pores. It isn't exactly a pretty sight, but it's nice to be able to take a close look from time to time.</p>
      <p>In terms of sound quality, the speaker isn't particularly crisp, but it's fairly impressive for the form factor. It gets louder than Amazon's third-generation <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/smart-home/117941/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-generation">Echo Dot</a> ($50), though of course, it can't come close to competing with dedicated speakers in the $400 range...or far less, for that matter. Ultimately, the speaker is here for listening to podcasts and music while you're getting ready, not for powering your next party.</p>
      <p>Alexa voice control works as expected, and is a welcome addition when your have powder in one hand a brush in the other.</p>
      <h3>Conclusions</h3>
      <p>The Simplehuman Sensor Mirror Hi-Fi makes it a joy to do your makeup while listening to your favorite music or podcasts. Whether that's worth $400, however, depends on how good the lighting is in your home and how much you value your morning routine. Most traditional vanity mirrors sell for anywhere from $30 to $150, and you can get a good smart speaker for as little as $50. Add a <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/lighting/41566/the-best-smart-light-bulbs">smart light bulb</a> and you'll still spend less far less than you will on the Sensor Mirror Hi-Fi. But the beauty of the Sensor Mirror is that it takes all of these seemingly disparate elements and wraps them into one attractive package. And it has certainly made my mornings a heck of a lot nicer.</p>
