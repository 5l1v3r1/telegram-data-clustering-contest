      <p>LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) — JaQuan Lyle scored 24 points, Carlton Bragg made two free throws with 43.9 seconds, and New Mexico held on to beat New Mexico State 78-77 on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Lyle made 9 of 14 from the field and Bragg finished with 14 points on 5-of-6 shooting and four steals. JJ Caldwell added nine points — all in the second half — and seven assists for the Lobos (5-1).</p>
      <p>Trevelin Queen scored six points during a 12-4 run that gave New Mexico State a 75-73 lead with 2:22 left in the game when he capped the spurt with two free throws. Corey Manigualt answered with a dunk 13 seconds later and, after the Aggies missed a 3-point shot, Caldwell converted a three-point play to give New Mexico a one-point lead with 90 seconds to go. Terrell Brown made a driving layup before Bragg’s foul shots put the Lobos in front for good.</p>
      <p>The teams combined for four turnovers over the next 35 seconds before New Mexico State’s Jabari Rice missed a clean look for 3 from the left corner. The Aggies fouled and Caldwell missed the front end of a 1-and-1 before Shunn Buchanan missed a potential winner at the buzzer.</p>
      <p>Queen had 23 points and nine rebounds for the Aggies (2-3). Rice added 13 points and Ivan Aurrecoechea scored 12.</p>
      <p>New Mexico takes on Auburn on Monday. New Mexico State matches up against Colorado State on Monday.</p>
