      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, -0.20% lost 54.8 points</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The S&amp;P 500 SPX fell back 4.92 points.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The Nasdaq Composite index COMP dropped 20.52 points. </b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>US benchmarks slipped again in a continuation of the downside corrections,  losing ground for a third consecutive losing session. Investors were subjected to forever conflicting trade- deal headlines with some reports saying that China is confident of a Phase-One deal and even had invited Washington's negotiating team to Beijing for face-to-face talks despite the Hong Kong bill. Then, in other reports, headlines came quite to the contrary, suggesting China will not do a deal if the HK bill passes into law.</p>

            <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-today-dxy-testing-98-on-conflicting-us-china-trade-headlines-201911212114">Forex today: DXY testing 98 on conflicting US/China trade headlines</a>

      </ul>
      <h3>Investor appetite soured by South China Morning Post headlines</h3>
      <p>The news came from the South China Morning Post, in an article entitled, "<i>China watching Donald Trump’s response to US Hong Kong bill as it threatens to become new barrier to trade deal</i>," and bullet points as follows: </p>
      <blockquote>   •  One source says Beijing may decide to ‘fight and talk alternatively’ and is now closely monitoring the US president’s next move following the vote by Congress<br/>   •  China reacted angrily to the proposals, accusing Washington of interfering in its internal affairs, and may feel obliged to respond.</blockquote>
      <p>As a result, stocks closed modestly lower with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, DJIA, losing 54.8 points, or 0.2%, to 27,766.29 while the S&amp;P 500 dropped back 4.92 points, or 0.2%, to 3,103.54. The Nasdaq Composite index fell 20.52 points, or 0.2%, to 8,506.21 having closed at its highest levels at the start of the week. </p>
