      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> Get Me Out Of Here! saw more tension between <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a>.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline and Andrew butted heads in the episode over who got to do bushtucker trials.</p>
      <p>After new campers Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi won eight stars for their camp in The Frontier of Fear, the other celebs had to decide whether to feed Andy and Cliff with their share of the food.</p>
      <p>The catch is that if they decided to be nice and share, they would have to send two campmates to join them as outlaws in the Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>In order to choose they decided to draw named water bottles, which Jacqueline felt was ‘scary’.</p>
      <p>When Kate Garraway and Ian Wright suggested that she could rule herself, she added: ‘Yeah but it’s not very heroic.’</p>
      <p>Andrew appeared to agree, and said: ‘I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out.</p>

      <p>‘It’s an ordeal that has to be shared. It’s not back to Snake Rock, it could be anything.’</p>

      <p>Adele Roberts chipped in: ‘I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it. If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed.’</p>
      <p>Things began to get heated and ended with Jacqueline and Nadine Coyle choosing not to take part.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the bush telegram, Andrew said he didn’t understand why the women got to rule themselves out.</p>
      <p>‘Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and erm…that’s the end of that…’ he recalled.</p>
      <p>Eventually – are tensions rose yet again – Kate and Andrew agreed to go to the Jailhouse.</p>
      <p>The latest falling out came after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebritys-andrew-maxwell-catches-jacqueline-jossa-talking-super-awkward-moment-11193330/">Andrew overheard Jaq talking about him in a seriously awkward moment</a>.</p>
