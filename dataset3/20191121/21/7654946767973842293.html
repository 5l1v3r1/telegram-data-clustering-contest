      <h1>Meteor showers, explosions threaten ‘9-1-1’ responders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:36:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:36</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Rorke</a></address>
      <h4><a href="https://www.fox.com/9-1-1/">9-1-1</a> | Monday, 8 p.m., Fox</h4>
      <p>The residents of an apartment building in LA find themselves dialing 911 when a meteor shower rains down debris on them in Monday night’s episode. The hit series has taken time away from mainly staving off disasters this season, to showing the toll that the job sometimes takes on first responders. EMS worker Henrietta Wilson (Aisha Hinds) is being investigated for her role in a car accident with an ambulance she was inside.</p>
      <p>Executive producer Tim Minear tells The Post about the intricacies of this episode as well as “Lone Star,” the series’ spinoff that will take “9-1-1’s” time slot when the show goes on Christmas break.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You’ve had earthquakes and tsunamis, why a meteor shower?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Because sometimes you think the universe is out to get you when it’s really trying to get your attention. It might do that by putting a hole through your roof and cauterizing it. I’m quoting a line from the script.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where is the apartment building?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The apartment building is in West Los Angeles. We held traffic on the street to film. It’s mainly the fire department and EMS. The only person who is not there for that call is Hen (Aisha Hinds), who is waiting to be cleared for an accident at the end of the last episode.</p>

      <p>
        <b>This isn’t the usual sort of emergency dealt with by the first responders. How do they learn about it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>They just respond to one person who has been struck by space debris. There’s emotional fallout and radioactive fallout. The characters are Maddie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) and Hen and Eddie (Ryan Guzman) have all been mandated to meet with a therapist who works with first responders. First responders experience some degree of trauma. That could be anybody from police officers to firefighters to a 911 operator.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did you use the Third Street tunnel in Downtown for another scene where a truck crashes in a tunnel?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We went downtown and used the tunnel, but we built our own version of the tunnel on location for the pyrotechnics. There’s a tractor-trailer and also a pickup truck that jackknifes and slams into the back of the trailer. The cargo swings into the opposing traffic lane.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“9-1-1” will go on hiatus in December to make way for “Lone Star,” a Texas-based spinoff which stars Rob Lowe and Liv Tyler as first responders. Can you tell us a little bit about the new show?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The show will take over our time slot for 10 episodes. It’s the same three-legged stool, police, fire and dispatch, as “9-1-1.” I call it “Barbecue-flavored 9-1-1.” It has a metropolitan feel, with the hipster vibe of Austin, Texas, and the underground music scene. In the same way that there are many flavors in LA, there are many flavors here, too. Rob Lowe plays a fireman who is a survivor of 9/11 and a New York transplant. Liv Tyler plays a very interesting character with some mystery to her. It took a lot for her to come to do this.</p>

      <h4><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80175798">The Irishman</a> | Wednesday, Netflix</h4>
      <p>“I hear you paint houses.” This ominous sentence, uttered a few times in Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” does not refer to a Benjamin Moore shade with an eggshell finish, but rather to the arterial spray left behind after hired gun Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro) rubs out mob enemies. The film <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/27/the-irishman-review-scorsese-de-niro-and-pesci-triumph/">is a flashback</a> of Sheeran’s many dark deeds and details his evolving relationship with Teamster president Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). The nearly four-hour saga is the last great gangster movie you are likely to see. With Joe Pesci, Ray Romano and “Boardwalk Empire’s” Stephen Graham.</p>
