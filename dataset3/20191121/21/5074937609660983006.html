      <h1>Christian Voice Ministry donates to Children with Cerebral Palsy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:02:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:02</time> by <a rel="author">Eunice Hilda Ampomah, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 21, GNA – The Women’s Fellowship of the Christian Voice Ministry, a Church in Abossey Okai, Accra, has donated assorted items worth GH¢10,000.00 and a sum of GH¢1,000.00 to children with cerebral palsy through the Givers Never Lack Foundation.</p>
      <p>Givers Never Lack Foundation is a not-for-profit Non-Governmental Organisation that promotes and advocates the welfare of persons especially children with cerebral palsy.</p>
      <p>The items included; packs of sanitary tissues, detergents, washing and bathing soaps, rice, gallons of cooking oil, packs of potable water, drinks, biscuits and clothes.</p>
      <p>Mrs Elizabeth Awuah, the President of the Women’s Fellowship, explained that her fellowship was touched by the plight of parents of children with cerebral palsy, which often left most of them in poverty.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the condition of the illness, most parents of such children are unable to work because the children need full attention on a day and it is difficult for someone else to accept to cater for them, even for a payment,” she said.</p>
      <p>She disclosed that an encounter with the Givers Never Lack Foundation brought to their notice, how some parents with such children ran away leaving the children with their other spouses due to frustration and inability to withstand the ‘uncomfortable’ condition again.</p>
      <p>“By this, we were touched to support the children in our small way because the parents don’t work and find challenges in taking care of the children,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mrs Awuah appealed to other benevolent individuals, churches, associations, and Non-Governmental Organisations to support the Foundation, which was striving hard to give hope to families with cerebral palsy conditions.</p>
      <p>Mr Edward Amankwah, the Founder of the Givers Never Lack Foundation, who is a parent of a cerebral palsy patient expressed gratitude to the Church for the support.</p>
      <p>The plight of cerebral palsy children and their parents, he said, could not be explained explicitly with words until people witnessed what they went through.</p>
      <p>“Such children always need to use diapers because they can barely talk if they want to ease themselves. If it is not love and the fear of God, one may give up taking care of them. But with supports like these, the parents are encouraged to have hope,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Amankwah appealed to well-meaning individuals and groups to help to put a smile on the faces of such children especially in the upcoming Christmas festivity.</p>
      <p>Cerebral Palsy is a congenital disorder of movement, muscle tone or posture and occurs when one has an abnormal brain development, often before birth.</p>
