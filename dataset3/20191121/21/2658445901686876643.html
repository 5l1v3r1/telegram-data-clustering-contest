      <p>House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila has called for the amendment of the constitution to ensure full autonomy for local governments.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the 12th Annual Conference of the Chartered Institute of Local Government and Public Administration of Nigeria in Abuja on Thursday, he said autonomy for local governments was the only way people at the grass roots could enjoy the benefits of government.</p>
      <p>The theme of the conference was: “Local government autonomy as the bedrock of rural development.’</p>
      <p>The Speaker, represented by the member, representing Lagos Mainland Federal Constituency Lagos State, Jide Jimoh, said: “I know for sure the issue of autonomy has to be taken from the constitution itself. There is nowhere in the whole world where you have the listed number of local governments in their constitution except in this country. Ab initio that is a failure on our part as a result because of the military decree that established that constitution and it is subject to be amended. By the time we want to amend it, we should take it off completely from local government and make sure we have democratically elected local government in place without putting the list of the number of local governments in the constitution. Therefore there would be freedom, there would be independence, people would vote for people of their choices and the result would be made available.</p>
      <p>“In order for us to do that, there is need for us to amend the constitution of this country, take away the issue of putting local government names in our constitution. Take it off completely. Allow the local government to be embedded in the constitution as an establishment on its own without numbering of 774 local government areas. If you do that, you have restricted the number of local governments to be created. You have restricted the power of people. You have restricted the power of people, you have restricted the control people, therefore the independent cannot be absolute. In order not to allow that to happen, what you need to do is to ensure that there should be an established local government in place which shall be controlled by democratically elected governments and there would be freedom for them’’.</p>
      <p>The institute’s President, Prof Kunle Awotokun, said local governments must be ready for accountability, if granted autonomy.</p>
      <p>According to him, states have abused the joint account with the local governments by hijacking money meant for the local governments.</p>
      <p>“The state governments have embarrassed the whole nation by hijacking money meant for local governments through the instrumentality of states, local government, joint accounts. They have abused it, there is no doubt about it. If they had not abused it, the previous arrangement would have been okay as a matter of protocol, decency and courtesy, that you don’t reach a local government directly from the federal, when are not running a unitary system of government. Since 1999 almost the state governments have abused the state, local government joint account and that is why, Mr President is trying to look at it from other perspectives,” he said.</p>

      <p>The Registrar, Dr Uche Okereke, said they were about creating value to local government and public administration in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>“Over the years, the local government system and public administration system has not been properly professionalized, but we thank the President of the Federal Republic last year, he assented to the Bill establishing this Institute making it the only professional body exclusively for local government employees and public administration.</p>
      <p>“Without the local government system in Nigeria, the country would not move forward as expected. Most of the problems being faced today in Nigeria is as a result of problems we have in the local government. With an effective local government system, politically, security wise, financially, we would have a strong government.</p>
      <p>“So government at the grassroot is the bedrock for rural development and that is why are championing local government autonomy. They should have independence from the state and federal and get their allocation straight from the federation account and manage it. Also there has to be political freedom. The election at the local government has to be conducted by INEC so that we would have a general election, not a governor waking up and dismissing local government chairmen for one thing or another. We want a situation where local governments would have full autonomy,” he said.</p>
