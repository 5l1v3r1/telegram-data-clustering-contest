      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Actor Sir Tony Robinson, 73, admits the best thing about his knighthood is it gets him hotel upgrades and from people who think he's incredibly important</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:31:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Jefferies, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/mark-jefferies/</a></address>
      <p>Sir Tony Robinson says the best thing about his knighthood is it gets him hotel upgrades from Americans who think he is incredibly important.</p>
      <p>The 73-year-old actor, best known as servant Baldrick in Blackadder, was knighted in 2013.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s great when you’re in the States because when you’re a Sir people think you’re related to the Queen.</p>
      <p>"So you get better service and probably an upgrade everywhere in North America.”</p>
      <p>Explaining how his 2013 knighthood has altered things, he said: “People hardly ever address me like that, I’m not the kind of person people would address as Sir.</p>
      <p>“When people do, I think ‘Oh yes, I’d forgotten about that.’ It’s just not an issue.</p>
      <p>"If people say would you rather I called you Sir Tony I say no but that’s as far as it goes."</p>
      <p>Speaking at a National Lottery event to celebrate their 25th anniversary, Sir Tony added: “They think I probably own Downton Abbey.”</p>
      <p>He also said his ambition was to act in a “sustained drama”.</p>

      <p>Tony said despite a varied career he still had TV and film ambitions left</p>
      <p>He said: “I would like to do a sustained drama on a big screen because virtually all the work I do is with a very small crew and when I go into do a comedy show it’s normally 5-6 scenes rather than having to take the responsibility for the whole thing on my shoulders.</p>

      <p>“I love what I do. I’m a passionate sort of person so it’s easy for me to find the adrenaline to do a job like this.” </p>
