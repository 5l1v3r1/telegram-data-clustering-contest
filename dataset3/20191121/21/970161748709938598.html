      <p>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK has crowned The Vivienne has the show’s very first drag race superstar.</p>
      <p>The Liverpudlian queen beat out Divina DiCampo and Baga Chipz to the top spot after eight weeks of acting, shade and a whole lot of sequins to come out on top.</p>
      <p>The final three were put through their paces in the last mega challenge, which saw them learn dance routines from Strictly’s AJ Pritchard and Love Island brother Curtis Pritchard, as well as appear on RuPaul and Michelle Visage’s podcast, What’s The Tee?</p>
      <p>Finally they had to come up with their own lyrics to RuPaul’s Rock It [To The Moon].</p>
      <p>Speaking after being given the crown, The Vivienne, real name James Lee Williams, put on her Donald Trump voice one last time and said: ‘It’s been absolutely great. It’s been tremendous. Thank you!’</p>

      <p>They later told the confessional: ‘I’m made up! I’ve just won the first ever season of Drag Race UK!</p>
      <p>‘And that crown is gorgeous,’ she laughed. ‘You’ll see me there washing the dishes in it!’</p>
      <p>Baga Chipz was the first of the three to be eliminated, leaving Divina and Baga in the top two to lip-sync for the crown to, amazingly, I’m Your Man by Wham!</p>

      <p>‘The Vivienne has it all, she can serve a look, deliver a line, she is without doubt a terrific drag queen, drag act,’ Graham Norton said in the final deliberations.</p>
      <p>Alan Carr agreed and said: She’s got that trademark wit. When she was Trump, oh my God, it was the best Trump I’ve ever seen. It was a comedy masterclass.’</p>
      <p>Then RuPaul herself declared: ‘The Viv is a perfect example of a 21<sup>st</sup> century British Queen. I think she is a great representative of what this competition can turn out.’</p>

      <p>During the chat with Ru and Michelle on the podcast, The Vivienne opened up about his past struggles with party drug ketamine, revealing a four-year spiral ended in him moving to Spain and getting sober.</p>
      <p>‘I struggled with addiction, and I’m two years clean now. It was breakfast, dinner and tea. I could have three bags of it just putting my face on,’ he explained.</p>
      <p>‘I just had to stop, it was a case of doctors telling me I was going to be dead by the time I was 30. I was getting evicted from apartments.</p>

      <p>‘I was on good money, I was in drag six nights a week, but I was living like a poor person.’</p>
      <p>Now happily sober and engaged, The Vivienne said that they hoped to help others in the gay community who struggle with drug addiction.</p>
      <p>As the winner of the show, The Vivienne has been given an all expenses paid trip to Los Angeles, creating her own YouTube series with production company, World of Wonder.</p>
