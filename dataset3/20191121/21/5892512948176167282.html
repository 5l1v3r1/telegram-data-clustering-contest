      <h1>Joanna Jedrzejczyk anoints herself female BMF — ‘Show me a better, cleaner fighter in UFC’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:04:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:04</time> by <a rel="author">Jesse Holland</a></address>
      <p>Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) women’s strawweight champion, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, operates on a level that most mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters could never understand, outside of ex-women’s bantamweight champion, Ronda Rousey.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/10/20909018/joanna-jedrzejczyk-still-champ-even-if-i-dont-have-belt-physically-mma">Just ask her, she’ll tell you</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s why Jedrzejczyk believes she is the best candidate for the female “BMF” — or “baddest mother fucker” title, originally created for Jorge Masvidal <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/11/20959933/ufc-nick-diaz-bmf-title-belongs-me-jorge-masvidal-baptize-brother-nate-diaz-mma">after he defeated Nate Diaz</a> in the UFC 244 pay-per-view (PPV) main event earlier this month in New York.</p>
      <p>“People used to call me violent, savage,” Jedrzjecyzk told <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/martial-arts/mixed-martial-arts/article/3038534/ufc-joanna-jedrzejczyk-says-she-deserves">South China Morning Post</a>. “Jorge just won the belt – the baddest mother fucker belt. I want to be the female BMF. These girls can make it, they can win the belt, but there’s nobody like Ronda Rousey, like me. People can doubt me, and they’ll do that forever, but show me a better, cleaner fighter in the UFC or in general.”</p>
      <p>No doubt critics will disqualify her from the “BMF” running based on <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/9/11/20861339/ufc-tampa-zhang-joanna-jedrzejczyk-not-good-when-she-was-champion-mma">her recent struggles inside the cage</a>. Once considered to be one of the top pound-for-pound fighters in UFC, Jedrzejczyk is 0-3 in her last three title fights, including her UFC 231 defeat to longtime rival Valentina Shevchenko.</p>
      <p>While nothing is official at this time, Jedrzejczyk is expected to fight current champion, Weili Zhang, for the 115-pound strap at some point in early 2020. “Magnum” captured the crown with her destruction of Jessica Andrade in the UFC Fight Night 157 main event last August.</p>
