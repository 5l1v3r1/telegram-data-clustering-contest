      <p>There's rarely a dull moment on I'm A Celebrity and the entrance of two late arrivals into the jungle sparked some serious tension.</p>
      <p>After the rest of this year's lineup have had a few days to settle into jungle life, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> new arrivals Andrew Whyment and Cliff Parisi were thrust onto the show with Bushtucker Trial The Frontier of Fear.</p>
      <p>And while they won a terrific 8 stars for camp, their excitement was short-lived as they were sent straight to Jungle Jail.</p>
      <p>The news of their arrival was broken to main camp as James and Kate brought a Jungle scroll into camp that had Andy and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-cliff-parisi-im-celebrity-17292507">Cliff’s</a> faces on as Outlaws.</p>
      <p>Kate read the scroll out to camp “You now have the opportunity to be good, bad or downright ugly.  So we can keep all the food ourselves, or we can choose to feed the outlaws with our share of food, however if we choose to feed them we will have to send two campmates to join them as outlaws in the Jailhouse.”</p>
      <p>Andrew and James both said they were happy to go, Kate and Ian also said they were happy to go.  Ian suggested they draw straws, which prompted a heated discussion, <i><b>as you can see in the video above taken from ITV.</b></i></p>
      <p>Jacqueline said “I think that’s scary.”  <i>(Referring to drawing names)</i> . Kate asked if she’d rather not go and Ian said she didn’t have to go.  Jacqueline said “Yeah but it’s not very heroic.”</p>
      <p>Andrew said “I think it has to be everyone in, I don’t think it’s fair to count yourself out.”</p>
      <p>James said “If she doesn’t want to do it, don’t do it," but Andrew wasn't having any of it, retorting“It’s an ordeal that has to be shared."</p>
      <p>Adele added “I think it’s just anybody that’s up for it.  If anyone wants to stay they should be allowed.” </p>
      <p>Tensions began to rise and Jacqueline and Nadine both expressed they didn’t want to take part and would prefer to remain in Main Camp.</p>
      <p>Talking in the BT, Andrew said “Jacqueline and Nadine said they didn’t want to go and erm…that’s the end of that…”</p>
      <p>Andrew didn’t understand why Nadine and Jacqueline wouldn’t put themselves up like everyone else.</p>
      <p>The campmates picked out named water bottles out of a bag and the last two remaining were the two to go to the Jailhouse – they were Kate and Andrew.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline said James didn’t mind going if Kate wanted to stay, more tension followed until the campmates all agreed to continue as discussed and Kate and Andrew would go.</p>
