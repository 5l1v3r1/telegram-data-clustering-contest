      <p>A beloved family puppy who went missing after its Chilliwack family dropped him off at a dog sitter is back home, nine days later.</p>
      <p>The Levinsky family pit bull puppy that went missing on Nov. 11 and was found by a Chilliwack Canada Post letter carrier on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Off in Mexico on vacation, Dan and Kim Levinsky were left worrying from afar while friends searched the streets of Chilliwack for their beloved family pet.</p>

      <p>Signs were put up all over the downtown area. Frankie’s story was shared on social media. And people were out looking for the 10-month-old dog.</p>
      <p>But on Wednesday, local letter carrier was doing her route when she spotted Frankie on Indigenous reserve land near Ashwell Road. She took a photo, it was shared, someone got in touch with the Levinskys, who confirmed the dog was theirs. Another woman brought Frankie home.</p>
      <p>Dan Levinsky posted on Facebook on Wednesday that the dog had no visible injuries, and that she’s at the veterinarian having a bath and food and would spend the night there.</p>
      <p>The family used Rover.com, a Seattle-based online marketplace for people to buy and sell pet care services including pet sitting, dog boarding and dog walking.</p>
      <p>It’s described by some as the Uber for dogs or Airbnb for pets.</p>
      <p>Within 30 minutes of being dropped off at a home in the downtown area, she jumped a fence and bolted.</p>
      <p>The Levinskys will be back from their holiday today and will reunite with Frankie, who — if only she could talk — would certainly have stories to tell of her adventures.</p>
