      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> taught <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> how to dance to a Girls Aloud song on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here – and it’s the best thing to have happened on the show so far.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline Jossa started dancing to The Promise by the girl band, and as she did Nadine taught her some of the moves.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn then asked if Nadine had danced on stage and Nadine said yes, Caitlyn smiled and said ‘I love that.’</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, Nadine, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> and Jacqueline all stood up to form their own girl band and Nadine taught them the moves to the song.</p>
      <p>Talking in the hut afterwards Nadine explained: ‘I taught the girls a little bit of The Promise routine, Jacqueline and Adele knew most of it already.</p>
      <p>‘Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we’ll teach her Sound of the Underground next.’</p>

      <p>All the camp cheered as the girls finished the dance routine, Nadine joked ‘We’re ready for the stage, send us in.’</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/11/caitlyn-jenner-liberated-after-gender-reassignment-surgery-and-admits-she-was-tired-of-tucking-it-in-all-the-time-6566938/">who had gender reassignment surgery in 2017</a> also discussed with her fellow campmates about being a parent, when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> candidly asked her what her children called her.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn responded: ‘My kids all call me dad, Kendall asked me first and I said “dad”, I’m your dad and I’ll always be your dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>‘But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it.’</p>
      <p>Kate asked if Caitlyn felt like their father, Caitlyn continued: ‘Bruce raised them and Caitlyn is enjoying their life with them.’</p>
