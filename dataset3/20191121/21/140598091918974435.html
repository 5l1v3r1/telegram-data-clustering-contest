      <h1>Metal detectorists found guilty of concealing £3m of Viking treasure</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:03:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/phoebe-southworth/" target="_blank">Phoebe Southworth</a></address>
      <p>Metal detectorists who pretended it was just a rumour that they had discovered £3m of Viking treasure have been found guilty of thieving the priceless trove.</p>
      <p>George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, failed to tell the UK authorities they had found coins and jewellery<b> </b>dating back 1,100 years to the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/only-in-britain/legacy-of-king-alfred-the-great/">reign of King Alfred the Great</a>.</p>
      <p>They came across the historic items while digging up Herefordshire farmland which did not belong to them on June 2, 2015.<b> </b></p>
      <p>Realising they would be the envy of fellow collectors across the world, they had planned to sell them off bit by bit for millions of pounds on the black market.</p>
      <p>They insisted that the only coins they found were declared to the National Museum Wales in Cardiff, and talk of any other items was just a rumour.</p>
      <p>But their plan was foiled when police discovered photographs of the haul on Davies' phone. </p>
      <p>All treasure found in the UK belongs to the Crown and a Treasure Valuation Committee decides how it should be shared among the finder and the landowner or tenant.    </p>
      <p>Powell had only handed over three coins to the owner of the land and those were "not particularly valuable", Worcester Crown Court heard during their seven-week trial.</p>
      <p>Among the treasure, much of which dated back to Anglo Saxon times,<b> </b>was a ninth-century gold ring, a dragon's head bracelet, a silver ingot, a crystal rock pendant dating to the fifth century and up to 300 coins - just 31 of which have been recovered.</p>
      <p>Five are examples of the exceptionally rare Two Emperors penny, valued at up to £50,000 apiece.</p>
      <p>Expert analysis of all the jewellery and coinage recovered to date and now held at the British Museum returned a valuation of at least £581,000.</p>
      <p>Police traced several coins that had been sold on to private collectors, hidden away or left with expert valuers. </p>
      <p>The court heard that some of the items had been wrapped in kitchen roll - a sign of "utter disrespect".</p>

      <p>During the trial, prosecutor Kevin Hegarty QC said:<b> </b>"Over 1,100 years ago, before the Norman Conquest, jewellery, coins and ingots were concealed in the ground near Eye Court Farm near Leominster, Herefordshire.</p>
      <p>"They remained there undisturbed for many hundreds of years until June 2015. Powell and Davies were out with their metal detectors on farmland at Eye Court Farm.</p>
      <p>"They were both experienced at metal detecting and they found jewellery, coins and ingots. And they knew when they found them that this was no ordinary find.</p>
      <p>"They soon learned it was not simply treasure but a hoard of very valuable coins. Such a quantity of coins of this kind would attract collectors from all over the world.</p>
      <p>"They decided to treat the find as theirs and not to declare it to the landowner, the tenant farmer and the coroner. In short, they stole it."  </p>
      <p>Addressing the whereabouts of the items never recovered, Mr Hegarty told jurors:<b> </b>"They have not been found. They must be concealed in one or more places or by now having been concealed have been dispersed never to be reassembled as a hoard of such coinage again."</p>
      <p>Powell, of Newport, and Davies, of Pontypridd, were found guilty of theft and conspiring to conceal the treasure.</p>
      <p>Their two accomplices, Paul Wells, 60, from Cardiff, and Simon Wicks, 57, of Hailsham, East Sussex, were convicted of conspiring to conceal the treasure.</p>
      <p>Wicks, Powell and Davies were also found guilty of converting their ill-gotten gains into cash.  </p>
      <p>All four men will be sentenced on Friday.</p>
