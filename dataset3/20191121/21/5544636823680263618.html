      <p>The UN Special Representative for West Africa and Sahel, Amb. Mohammed Ibn-Chambers has restated commitments to support Nigeria to combat insurgency in the northeast and Lake Chad Basin.</p>
      <p>Ibn-Chambas made the pledge on Monday when a delegation of the UN and European Union (EU) officials paid a courtesy visit to Maj.-Gen. Olusegun Adeniyi, the Theater Commander, Operation Lafiya Dole (OPLD) in Maiduguri.</p>
      <p>He said that he would mobilize global partnership to support Nigeria in the campaign against insurgency.</p>
      <p>Ibn Chambers said that the visit was in pursuance to the UN Council resolution 2049 of 2017; which seek to promote partnerships between international actors and Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) States.</p>
      <p>“In this context we have been very supportive of the individual efforts of the LCBC member states to combat, defeat and eliminate terrorism in whatever form or shape it manifested itself in the region.</p>
      <p>“Let me also underscore the strong support of the UN for the gallant efforts the Nigerian Armed Forces, to totally eradicate Boko Haram and any terrorists group which may be operating in Borno or any other state of the northeast and the Lake Chad Basin.</p>
      <p>“The UN has from its inception strongly supported the Multi National Joint Task Force (MNJTF).</p>
      <p>“We all know the negative, nefarious and wicked intention of Boko Haram, its criminal aspect, destruction and killings it brought to several armless civilian population,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ibn Chambers noted that the UN condemned terrorism in its entirety globally, adding that the fight against Boko Haram was not for Nigeria alone but rather a global campaign that required support from international community.</p>
      <p>He added that terrorism in the region was a manifestation of international terrorism and stressed the need for collaborative effort to ensure its defeat.</p>
      <p>The UN representative underscored the need for synergy between the military; international community, humanitarian actors, development organisations and governments to end insurgency.</p>
      <p>“We want to assure you of our desire to cooperate in the very difficult and challenging task you have as Armed Forces to create space for humanitarian and development organisations to be able to undertake their activities without fear or hindrance.</p>
      <p>“Your victory is our successes because you will create opportunities for our humanitarian workers and our other colleagues to be able to reach out to communities that are suppressed,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also Speaking, Amb. Francois Fall, the UN Special Representative for Central Africa, called for international community support to states affected by the insurgency.</p>
      <p>Fall noted that urgent measures were necessary to address the humanitarian crisis caused by insurgency.</p>
      <p>He disclosed that the team had visited the four LCBC States and interacted with MNJTF’s commanders in each of the countries visited.</p>
      <p>“The importance of this is the solidarity; the UN, EU and all partners without their efforts, your work will be ineffective.</p>
      <p>“The proof of this solidarity is our presence here today. The EU has been supporting your effort from the very beginning with the famous 55 million Euros given through the African Union (AU).</p>
      <p>“So far, 61 vehicles have also been given, 5 ambulances, communication equipment, provisions of lubricant and other infrastructures to enhance your operations. There will still be few other projects that would be approved,” Fall said.</p>
      <p>While commending the military over its contributions in the campaign, Fall reiterated the commitment of the EU to support Nigeria to combat terrorism.</p>
      <p>In his response, Adeniyi, thanked the team for the visit, adding that it would boost troops’ morale.</p>
      <p>Adeniyi described the support of the UN, EU and international community as “strong behind the military”.</p>
      <p>“I want to assure you that all the talks going round that the northeast will fall to Boko Haram will not happen.</p>
      <p>“I disassociated myself as the commander of this operation and my officers from the talk of what Boko Haram will do, very soon they will continue to crumble.</p>
      <p>“I want to continue to solicit your support that our nation is enjoying, Borno, Yobe and Adamawa are enjoying in the course of these operations, let it continue and we promise you we will not fail you,” Adeniyi said.</p>
      <p>He stressed that the military was executing the war in accordance with the Rules of Engagement and international human right laws.</p>
      <p>According to him, the military was professional in the discharge of its duties and would not condone abuse and other forms of misdemeanour by troops.</p>
