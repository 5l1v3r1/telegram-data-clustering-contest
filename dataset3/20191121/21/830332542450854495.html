      <p>MADISON, Wis. - A Verona woman convicted of reckless homicide nearly a decade ago is asking a Dane County judge to grant her a new trial.</p>
      <p>In 2009, Jennifer Hancock was sentenced to 13 years in prison for the death of a baby boy at a day care she ran out of her home.</p>
      <p>A judge at Dane County court listened to new evidence in the case on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The doctor who performed an autopsy on Lincoln Wilbur 12 years ago said he no longer can say abuse was the only possible cause of death.</p>
      <p>Hancock is represented by the Wisconsin Innocence Project, which filed a motion for a new trial in February. The clinic argued that the medical testimony in the 2009 trial was flawed, leading to the prosecution's lead medical expert changing his own opinion.</p>
      <p>Dr. Michael Stier testified originally that a subdural hematoma seen on the baby was a sign of abuse, but in court, he cited research showing that other infants with similar conditions died by means other than abuse.</p>
      <p>"So for that reason and other reasons embedded in my original examination and autopsy report of Lincoln Wilbur, I no longer can state to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Lincoln died from a non-accidental trauma," Stier said.</p>
      <p>Thursday was the first of four hearings where a judge is listening to new evidence and must decide whether to grant Hancock a new trial.</p>
      <p>That decision is not expected to be made for at least a month.</p>
      <p>Hancock also argues that her original defense attorney, John Hyland, now a Dane County judge, did not perform to the best of his abilities.</p>
      <p>Hyland is also testifying this week.</p>
