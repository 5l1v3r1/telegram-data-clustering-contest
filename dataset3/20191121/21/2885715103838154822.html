      <h2>When image matters more than substance, why blame a con man for wanting perks of a pilot without putting in the work?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:30:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/editorial/" target="_blank">Editorial</a></address>
      <p>Rajan Mahbubani decided to dress for the job he wanted. For over a year, the 48-year-old consultant from Kolkata passed through airport security, dressed in a pilot’s uniform he had stitched in his hometown, and availed all the perks his sartorial deception offered: He was upgraded frequently to business/first class, “talked shop” with pilots to gain access to the cockpit and generally received preferential treatment. And, Mahbubani told the police after he was finally caught and arrested, the uniform helped him impress women on <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a>, TikTok and in person. In addition to a pilot, Mahbubani has also pretended to be an army colonel, uniform and all.</p>
      <p>But, the justified criminal charge of cheating against him notwithstanding, let’s be honest about what lies beneath the pilfering pilot’s high-altitude con. The problem was best articulated by Renee Zellweger’s character in Jerry Maguire: “First-class used to be a better meal, now it’s a better life.” Mahbubani presented an image of himself that was aspirational, and falsified a biography. But at the root of his crime is the desire to be “special”, a successful person in uniform, a VIP — not just another middle-aged face standing in queue at the boarding gate.</p>
      <p>It is not yet known if Mahbubani was inspired by Steven Spielberg’s Catch Me if You Can. In the film, Leonardo DiCaprio’s character impersonates a pilot, like Mahbubani, to make money and travel the world. The character struck a sympathetic chord because most ordinary people wish to cheat the system, to be the ones others look up to and to sit in the better lounge at the airport. Mahbubani didn’t want to fly a plane or serve in the Indian armed forces, he just wanted the perks. In times such as these, he may have been the one who was caught, but he is not a lonely figure, he has company.</p>
