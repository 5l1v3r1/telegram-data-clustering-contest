      <p>Do you have a turkey in your freezer that you're preparing to cook for Thanksgiving? Depending on the size of the turkey, it might be about time for you to begin thawing the bird.</p>
      <p>Here is a general rule of thumb on when to move your turkey from the freezer to the refrigerator, according to the USDA:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 to 12 pounds — 1 to 3 days</li>
        <li>12 to 16 pounds — 3 to 4 days</li>
        <li>16 to 20 pounds — 4 to 5 days</li>
        <li>20 to 24 pounds —5 to 6 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But let's say you missed the deadline, does that mean you'll have to wait until Thanksgiving to cook the turkey?There is a way to thaw the turkey using water, but it does require some labor. <br/>According to the USDA, after placing the turkey in a water-tight bag, submerge the wrapped turkey in cold tap water. Then, change the water every 30 minutes until thawed.</p>
      <p>Here is how long it takes to thaw a turkey using water.:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>4 to 12 pounds — 2 to 6 hours</li>
        <li>12 to 16 pounds — 6 to 8 hours</li>
        <li>16 to 20 pounds — 8 to 10 hours</li>
        <li>20 to 24 pounds — 10 to 12 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once a turkey is thawed, the USDA says that a turkey must be cooked within one to two days before becoming contaminated.</p>
      <p>Here are some other tips from the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/turkeytime/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention </a>for preparing a turkey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Safely Handle Your Turkey</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although turkey is a popular entree this time of year, it is also easy to improperly cook a turkey. And while it would be easy to leave a turkey in the oven for a long period of time, it could also cause a turkey to dry out and lose flavor.</p>
      <p>Bacteria from raw poultry can contaminate anything that it touches. Follow the four steps to food safety – cook, clean, chill and separate – to prevent the spread of bacteria to your food and family.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Safely Stuff Your Turkey</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Cook stuffing in a casserole dish to make sure it is thoroughly cooked. If you stuff the turkey, do so just before cooking. Use a food thermometer to make sure the stuffing's center reaches 165°F. Bacteria can survive in stuffing that has not reached 165°F and possibly cause food poisoning. If the stuffing is inside a whole turkey, take the bird out of the oven and let it stand 20 minutes before removing the stuffing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Safely Cook Your Turkey</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Set the oven temperature to at least 325°F. Place the completely thawed turkey with the breast side up in a roasting pan that is 2 to 2-1/2 inches deep. Cooking times will vary depending on the weight of the turkey. To make sure the turkey has reached a safe internal temperature of 165°F, check by inserting a food thermometer into the center of the stuffing and the thickest portions of the breast, thigh, and wing joint.</p>
      <p>Let the turkey stand 20 minutes before removing all stuffing from the cavity and carving the meat. Learn more about safe minimum cooking temperatures and how to use and calibrate a food thermometer for turkey and other foods.</p>
