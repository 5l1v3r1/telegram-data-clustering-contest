      <h1>NFL Issues Statement On Myles Garrett’s Accusation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T21:22:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 21:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this afternoon, Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett alleged Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/myles-garrett-accuses-mason-rudolph-of-using-racial-slur-before-fight">Mason Rudolph called him a racial slur</a> before last Thursday night’s brawl.</p>
      <p>According to a report from ESPN, Garrett brought up the alleged slur in his meeting with the NFL regarding a potential appeal to his suspension. Rudolph’s agent released a statement denying the allegation.</p>
      <p>Not long after the allegation leaked, the NFL upheld Garrett’s suspension.</p>
      <p>Now we know why. According to a statement from Brian McCarthy, PR person for the league, the NFL “found no such evidence” of a racial slur levied by Rudolph against Garrett.</p>

      <p>Garrett received an indefinite suspension after he hit Rudolph with his own helmet. The NFL’s ruling means the star defensive end will miss the rest of the 2019 season. He can file for reinstatement after this season concludes.</p>
      <p>In regards to the allegations, Rudolph’s teammates – obviously – came to his defense.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkKaboly/status/1197589981616918530">Pittsburgh insider Mark Kaboly</a>, several Steelers players “aren’t happy with the news,” and called the allegations “bogus.”</p>
      <p>Steelers star defensive lineman Cam Heyward also came out in support of his quarterback. “I know Mason didn’t say that,” <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-north/pittsburgh-steelers/steelers-players-react-to-myles-garretts-racial-slur-allegation">Heyward said</a>.</p>
      <p>Cleveland and Pittsburgh face off again in just two weeks. Neither Garrett nor Steelers offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey will be on the field.</p>
