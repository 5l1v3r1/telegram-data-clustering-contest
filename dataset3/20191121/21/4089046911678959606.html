      <p><b>PIKE COUNTY, Ky. (WVLT/WYMT) --</b> A Kentucky man works to preserve the legacy of men and women who fought for America in his own special way.</p>
      <p>Keith Long, the owner of Long's Exterior Washing in Pike County, said he's grateful for the opportunity to do what he can to keep veterans' memories alive in Kentucky.</p>
      <p>Long told WYMT, "They're not forgotten to me." Long pressure washes veterans' headstones for free in his community.</p>
      <p>"I was just thankful I was grateful to be here because without these guys I wouldn't be here. I wouldn't have all these opportunities that's just been handed straight in front of me. There's just no way," said Long.</p>
      <p>Long said he was an addict for more than 10 years, and pressure washing is how he got back on track. "Last time I got arrested it was like I'm just so tired of this. There's gotta be a better life," said Long.</p>
      <p>A call from a community member sparked his own personal restoration.</p>
      <p>"Somebody called me to come wash their house or something like that, and it just took off so I mean I've just not looked back," said Long.</p>
      <p>Long said he's been clean for almost two years, and he now owns his own business.</p>
      <p>"I just want to give back to the community that's just given so much to me," said Long. To do that, he cleans veterans' headstones at the Annie E. Young Cemetery.</p>
      <p>"It's just nice that they're not forgotten about. That's kind of the whole reason behind it is that nobody is forgotten about," said Long.</p>
