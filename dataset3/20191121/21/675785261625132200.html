      <p>Pictures show a wall of fire across a major motorway after a lorry filled with chocolate exploded into flames.</p>
      <p>The fireball erupted after the lorry filled with the sweet treat burst into flames and sparked a major blaze.</p>
      <p>Emergency services rushed to the scene on the A556 towards the M6 in Cheshire and firefighters are working at pace to get the blaze under control.</p>
      <p>All lanes have been closed on the busy road, reports <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/chocolate-lorry-bursts-flames-fireball-17297385">the Liverpool Echo</a>, and traffic is being disrupted.</p>
      <p>The lorry was driving near the M56 at Knutsford and was "laden with chocolate", according to a spokesman for the North West Motorway Police.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Police said the road was blocked just before the motorway.</p>
      <p>Thankfully the driver appears to be uninjured.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "@HIGHWAYSNWWEST and police currently dealing with an HGV fire on the A556 near to the M56 towards the M6.</p>
