      <p>BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia’s finance minister Sinisa Mali plagiarized parts of his Ph.D. thesis, the University of Belgrade said on Thursday, after his work was challenged by scholars prompting long-standing opposition demands for his resignation.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the university, the largest and most prestigious in the country, said Mali, a trusted ally of President Aleksandar Vucic, “copied texts, or entire paragraphs, from the writings of other authors without mentioning their names, thus violating university’s ethical code”.</p>
      <p>The university’s dean, Ivanka Popovic, said that its ethics board had unanimously decided to nullify the degree Mali had earned with his 2013 thesis on restructuring and privatization.</p>
      <p>“The Board for Professional Ethics will deliver its final ruling to the Senate of the University for the ... annulment of (Mali’s) diploma,” she said.</p>
      <p>Mali, who has repeatedly denied accusations over his diploma, said he would continue working.</p>
      <p>“I am more focused on Serbia’s budget which is the job for which I am paid by Serbian citizens,” the state-run Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying.</p>
      <p>The scandal over Mali’s thesis had prompted calls for his resignation from Serbia’s fragmented opposition and students who for almost a year have staged weekly protests against Vucic’s rule they see as corrupt and authoritarian.</p>
      <p>Mali previously served as the mayor of the capital Belgrade.</p>
