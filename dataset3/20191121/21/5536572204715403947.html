      <h1>Steelers’ Cameron Heyward Calls Out Myles Garrett Using Racial Slur Allegation Against Mason Rudolph (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Cameron Heyward is not going to sit around and let his teammate get slandered.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, it was reported that Browns defensive end Myles Garrett alleged that Steelers QB Mason Rudolph directed a racial slur at him.</p>
      <p>The Steelers defensive lineman defended his teammate.</p>
      <blockquote>“He is being villainized by it,” Heyward said, via video from Brooke Pryor of ESPN. “He said, ‘I’m going to be labeled as that.’ I just don’t think that’s right. That’s my teammate, and I’m going to fight for him.”</blockquote>

      <blockquote>“I think we’ve just got to open up to our mistakes as men and move on,” Heyward said. “For [the slur allegation] to be a part of the appeal is stupid to me because that doesn’t get you out of what you did. And we’ve got to move forward and he’s got to own up to his actions.”</blockquote>
      <p>Rudolph was initially scheduled to speak to the media on Thursday, but the team decided to release a statement instead.</p>
