      <p>Following closely behind Sonos offering use of free Spotify accounts, Amazon Echo speakers now share the same functionality. This is a big shot in the arm for current Echo speaker users as well as those considering investing in the platform.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-11-20/spotify-free-users-you-can-now-stream-music-on-amazon-alexa-sonos-and-bose-speakers/%E2%80%9D">Spotify blog</a> gives some further insight into the expanding options for use of Spotify free accounts.</p>
      <blockquote>Free users in Australia, New Zealand, and the U.S. will, for the first time, be able to ask Alexa to play Today’s Top Hits, their Discover Weekly, or a custom-made playlist on their Amazon Echo or Fire TV.</blockquote>
      <p>Clearly this update is aimed at enticing more buyers to the Amazon Echo platform, but with the same option to use Spotify Free on Sonos and Bose streaming speakers they’re in for some stiff competition.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Given the option, which streaming platform and speaker would you use?</i>
