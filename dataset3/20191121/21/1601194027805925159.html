      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">WWE NXT</a> has beaten <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/all-elite-wrestling">AEW</a> Dynamite in the 'Wednesday Night Wars' on the measurement on television ratings for the first time since the pair went head to head for midweek wrestling supremacy.</p>
      <p>This week, WWE's black and gold brought in a whopping 916,000 on the go-home show heading into a weekend of NXT TakeOver: WarGames and WWE Survivor Series, while AEW finished up just 23,000 viewers below on 893,000.</p>
      <p>While the numbers aren't too far apart, NXT managed a monumental increase from the 750,000 achieved last week with a star-studded show which saw <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a>, Drew McIntyre, Cesaro and many others appear on the show, while RAW Women's Champion Becky Lynch would compete against Rhea Ripley, and The Revival would put on a clinic against The Undisputed Era.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, AEW were very slightly down on last week, with Dynamite featuring a chaotic, but immense main event featuring Jon Moxley and Darby Allin, and Nick Jackson would compete in a rare singles match against Rey Fenix.</p>

      <p>It'll be very interesting to see whether NXT can keep up this momentum, and how AEW will react. Is Dynamite plateauing? Is NXT still in flux? Well, one thing is for sure, both shows are certainly thriving, and it'll be incredibly exciting to see what happens next week!</p>
