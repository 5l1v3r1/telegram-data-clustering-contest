        <b>Struggling Italian giants AC Milan have offered Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic a six-month deal to come to their aid, according to Italian media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 38-year-old striker confirmed his departure from Los Angeles Galaxy last week following the club’s elimination from the Major League Soccer playoffs.</p>
      <p>Gazzetta dello Sport and Sky Sports Italia reported that the former seven-time European champions have now made contact with the player’s agent Mino Raiola.</p>
      <p>The US-owned club want the former Swedish international for six months and are prepared to pay him six million euros ($6.6 million) if he remains for 18 months in total, Gazzetta claimed.</p>
      <p>Milan finished fifth last season, missing out on a return to Champions League football by just a point to city rivals Inter.</p>
      <p>They have had a poor start to this campaign and are 14th after 12 games before they host last year’s runners-up Napoli on Saturday in the San Siro.</p>
      <p>Ibrahimovic played for two seasons between 2010 and 2012 with AC Milan, helping them to their last Serie A title, and scoring 42 goals in 61 league appearances.</p>
      <p>He also won three league titles with Inter Milan, and two with Juventus, which were both revoked following the ’Calciopoli’ match-fixing scandal.</p>
