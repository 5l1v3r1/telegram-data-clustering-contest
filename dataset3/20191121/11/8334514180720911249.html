      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party released its election manifesto on Thursday, including plans for higher taxes on London’s vast financial services industry.</p>
      <p>Below are some of the policies:</p>
      <h3>FINANCIAL TRANSACTION TAX</h3>
      <p>Labour will expand Britain’s existing financial transaction tax on shares to trading on other assets, including foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives and commodities.</p>
      <p>The party said the tax would be based on who does the trade rather than where the transaction takes place.</p>
      <p>Labour said the tax may raise 8.8 billion pounds ($11.4 billion) in 2023-2024 and will reduce trading volatility.</p>
      <h3>CORPORATION TAX</h3>
      <p>Labour said they will increase corporation tax by 1 pence per pound next year raising an extra 2 billion pounds.</p>
      <p>The party will also review corporate tax reliefs with a view to reducing them by 4.3 billion pounds.</p>
