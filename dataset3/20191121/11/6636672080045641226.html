      <h1>Semiconductor revenue declines but UK bucks the trend</h1>

        <b>European semiconductor distribution revenues fell by 8.9% in Q3 2019, reports <a href="http://www.dmass.com/">DMASS</a>, a non-profit organisation which monitors the European semiconductor distribution industry. Yet the UK is bucking the trend with – albeit a modest – growth of 1.6% in the same period.</b>

      <p>The largest market, Germany’s semiconductor distribution revenue dropped 12.9% to €618m, Italy’s fell by 13.1% to €168m, France’s declined by 15% to €132m and the Nordic countries recorded smaller decreases (3.7% to €183m) in Q3, yet the UK realised revenues of €159m, an increase of 1.6%. Eastern Europe also grew, by 0.5% to €380m.</p>
      <p>This follows a relatively stable market in 2019, where total European revenues for semiconductor distribution were around €2.3 for 2018, yet fluctuated more this year, rising sharply to €2.5m in Q1 2019, reverting to €2.3 in Q2, and falling again in Q3.</p>
      <p>Georg Steinberger, chairman of DMASS, remained optimistic, saying this was not unforeseen: “A slowdown in customer bookings throughout the year now materialised in a not surprising revenue decline,” he said. He believes the mix of factors driving a slowdown, mixed with caution in the market will prevail for a while but added “We think that the opportunities for technology are still great. We expect the market to return during 2020.”</p>
      <p>Countries, principally in eastern Europe, with a large share of contract manufacturing remain stable or show growth, as they benefit from a shift by OEM-driven markets. “The most surprising aspect of this quarter is the resilience of the UK against the current Brexit frenzy,” said Steinberger.</p>
      <p>The breakdown of product categories is 11.7% decline for MOS micros, 8.65% fall for analogue products, optos fell by 7.5%, power discretes dropped 2.6% and other logic revenues fell by 0.6%.</p>
      <p>Steinberger remained optimistic: “What is hard to estimate is the impact of suppliers taking business from distribution direct. We know that areas like analogue, programmable logic or MOS micros are affected by it and will be more so in the future, he said. Referring to new and emerging technologies, he added: “We believe that we will see more disruptive innovation in the next few years and more opportunities for distribution.”</p>
