      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have appointed Jose Mourinho as their new manager, and Jamie O’Hara believes that Harry Kane will be happy under the Special One in North London.</p>
      <p>Ex-Spurs man, O’Hara, asks why Kane would want to leave under Mourinho, a manager who wins trophies wherever he goes.</p>
      <p>He goes as far to say that, with Jose in charge, Kane could win a Champions League title. This comes after Spurs finished second in the European competition last season, with Kane having to make do with a runners-up medal.</p>
