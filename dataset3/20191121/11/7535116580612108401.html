      <p>Some people are genuinely kind and want to help others while there are people who pretend to be helpful but actually have an ulterior motive. That’s why we should always be on our guard even if a good Samaritan appears when we’re in trouble as it never hurts to be careful!</p>

      <p><b>This 50-year-old man thought he could trust a “kind soul” who appeared to help him, but in the process, he unknowingly lost RM200,000 in cash to the man.</b> The incident happened on Tuesday (November 19th) when the victim went to a bank in SS15 with his colleague around 1.20pm, <a href="https://sjecho.com.my/crime/good-samaritan-runs-off-with-rm200k-from-victims-car/?fbclid=IwAR3DiObVZgJ9VofIbX7c_rPK1eWRZnNt_VZ-lg2Ct3i67OlpajmrCgQXBGU">SJ Echo</a> reported.</p>
      <p>He had withdrawn RM200,000 from the bank and got into his 4WD before heading towards USJ via Persiaran Kewajipan. Along the way, while passing by SS13, the man noticed that his right tyre at the back had suffered a flat, so he pulled over near a petrol station to check it out.</p>

      <p>The man and his colleague got down from the car to inspect the flat tyre when another man appeared, ostensibly to “help” them out. <b>He offered to help them change the tyre but during the process, he quietly opened the back left door where they had put a brown bag with the RM200,000 inside. </b></p>
      <p>The victim did not realise what had happened until later but by then, it was too late as the “good Samaritan” had escaped in a red Toyota Vios. They lodged a police report and investigations are ongoing. Meanwhile, netizens were shocked by the audacity of the man and suspected that the thief had already targeted the man when he saw him withdraw the RM200,000. They even said that the thief had most probably caused the flat tyre so that he could snatch the RM200,000.</p>

        <i>Remember to always be on alert even when someone is trying to help you because it’s better to be safe than sorry!</i>
