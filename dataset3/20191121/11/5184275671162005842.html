      <p>Speaking to Pinkvilla in a recent interview, Neha opened up about having no film offers coming her way. The <i>Chupke Chupke</i> actress said, “Firstly, I believe that you cannot wait for work to come to you. We all have our platforms today and we all have shops. Secondly, when you become a mum, yes, there is a perception. The last thing I did before pregnancy was <i>Tumhari Sulu</i>, for which I won an award. But despite that, I did not get any offers as far as movies are concerned, post-pregnancy. I did not get any offers after I gave birth either. Now, I am in talks for a web show, so let’s see about that.”</p>
      <p>Neha, who is not someone to mince her words, lashed out at body shamers who trolled her for putting on weight post-pregnancy. “I did not have insecurity when I was pregnant. I started facing body image issues was after I gave birth. I am not saying that people need to lose weight, being perfect is everyone’s own version. But, what happens mentally is that everything acts up together. I remember I was trolled very badly where a female journalist wrote something on my weight, and I wrote back. It is not fair to trouble a new mum over her body weight.”</p>
