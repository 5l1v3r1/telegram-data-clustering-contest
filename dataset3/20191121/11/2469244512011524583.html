      <h1>Coldplay will not tour for two years due to environmental concerns</h1>
      <h2>'Our dream is to have a show with no single-use plastic and have it largely solar-powered'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:49:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:49</time> by <a rel="author">Howard Lloyd</a></address>
      <p>Coldplay have announced they will not go back on tour for the next two years until their concerts are more environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p>Lead singer Chris Martin, <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/chris-martin-exeter-coldplay-dropped-3461066">who grew up in the Exeter area</a>, says it is the band's dream to 'have a show with no single-use plastic and have it largely solar-powered'.</p>
      <p>"We’re taking time over the next year or two to work out how our tour can be not only sustainable but actively beneficial," the 42-year-old singer said.</p>
      <p>"All of us in every industry have to just work out what the best way of doing our job is.</p>
      <p>"How can we harness the resources that our tour creates and make it have a positive impact? Our dream is to have a show with no single-use plastic and have it largely solar-powered.</p>
      <p>"I think it is a question of accepting you have to do your best and not be over-zealous of criticising others because everyone will catch up if you prove that it is easy to do it the right way."</p>

      <p>The band - who are currently in Jordan performing - hit the headlines last month after unveiling the track listing for their latest album "Everyday Life" in a series of local newspapers, including <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/whats-on/music-nightlife/coldplay-post-advert-todays-express-3460299">the Express &amp; Echo</a>.</p>
      <p>The album is due for release tomorrow.</p>
      <p>The ad, which appears on page 50 of Thursday’s paper, shows a list of tracks underneath the two sections of the new album.</p>
      <p>Chris was educated at Hylton School and Exeter Cathedral School, which is where he found his passion for music, and keeps close ties to the area.</p>
