      </p>
      <p>Ian replied: "I really honestly don't want no more. [James Haskell] needs it more than I would."</p>
      <p>Andrew pointed out: "There's two Ian," to which Ian said: "He can have another one if he wants. I don't want no more."</p>
      <aside>I think Ian will quit by the end of the week.</aside>
      <p>Andrew said: "Jesus, the drama. Just eat some!" to which Ian snapped: "I said I don't want no more [expletive] crocodile bruv. I don't want no more!"</p>
      <p>In the Bush Telegraph, Ian said: "There's nothing more frustrating then when you're saying no to something and someone continues to ask you. It's annoying."</p>
      <p>Andrew said in the Bush Telegraph: "I felt bad that I was pressurising [him] too much into eating it. He came back at me but I get it."</p>

      <p>Ian added: "It's only four days in and it's already like that so we're going to have to see how it goes because tensions and frustrations will creep in.</p>
      <p>"That is where the test is going to come as well for me if people start to get on my nerves. Up to this point no-one has done that but it's early doors."</p>
      <p>Viewers were divided over the spat and some people reckon he'll quit the show.</p>
      <p>One person said: "I think Ian will quit by [the] end of [the] week #imaceleb."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Idk why but I can see Ian quitting."</p>
