      <h1>Tottenham fans will love what Rafael van der Vaart has said about 'our club' and Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Former Spurs star has been talking about Mauricio Pochettino's sacking and Jose Mourinho's appointment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author">Lee Wilmot</a></address>
      <p>Rafael van der Vaart was a hugely popular figure at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman only spent two years in N17, but was a firm fans' favourite in that time.</p>
      <p>His transfer to Spurs came almost out of the blue, with no one having any inkling of a move until transfer deadline day in 2010.</p>
      <p>Van der Vaart had spent two years at Real Madrid before being told he could leave for north London...by Jose Mourinho, who had just arrived at the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is now in charge of Tottenham, having taken over the club on Wednesday, just 11 hours after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked.</p>
      <p>And while van Der Vaart was loved by the Spurs fans, the affection has always gone both ways, with the Dutchman holding the club close to his heart, despite just two years there.</p>
      <p>Tottenham fans will love what van der Vaart has said about the future under Mourinho too.</p>
      <p>There is concern about the former Chelsea and Manchester United boss taking over in some sections of the fanbase, but van der Vaart has moved to reassure anyone with any doubts.</p>

      <p>In a passionate series of tweets, he said: "Football is so crazy at times. We all know that, fans, players, staff. I was as shocked as everyone. Poch has done a tremendous job at Spurs, and it won’t be easy to top his team performance and passion for our club.</p>
      <p>"In football nothing is certain, but one thing is: Mourinho will stir things up, so let’s see what happens. He is a phenomenal coach, straightforward and ambitious and so are our boys. So <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23COYS">#COYS</a> heads up, chest out."</p>
