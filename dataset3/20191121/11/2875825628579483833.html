      <h1>Slovakia travel guide for Republic of Ireland fans ahead of Euro 2020 play-off semi-final</h1>
      <h2>Thousands of Irish fans will descend on the Slovakian capital in March</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:14:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author">Trevor Quinn</a></address>
      <p>Ireland's crucial clash against Slovakia in the Euro 2020 play-off semi-final will see the capital Bratislava flooded with fans on March 26.</p>
      <p>And it’s not the first time Irish supporters have travelled to the Central European country.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/republic-of-ireland-football-team">The Boys In Green</a> have taken on their rivals five times before, winning one and drawing four.</p>
      <p>But here the Irish Mirror looks at the vital off-the-pitch details about what you can expect in Slovakia, from the price of a pint to the cost of hotels and flights.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Population</b>
      </p>
      <p>Slovakia has a population of 5.45 million, about 600,000 more people than in Ireland.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Where is it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Slovakia, officially the Slovak Republic, is bordered by the Czech Republic to the north-west, Hungary to the south, Austria to the west, Poland to the north and Ukraine to the east.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do I need a visa to visit Slovakia?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, not if you are Irish. Slovakia has been part of the EU since May 2004. A passport or a valid ID will be fine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What time zone is Slovakia in?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Slovakia uses the Central European Time like Italy, Germany or France and it is one hour ahead of us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How much will a flight cost and how long will it take?</b>
      </p>

      <p>One of the return flights from Dublin to Bratislava yesterday evening cost €195. They take off March 25, the day before the match, and return two <br/>days later.</p>
      <p>However, there were many alternatives available to nearby Vienna and Budapest with connecting buses to Bratislava priced at just €5.</p>
      <p>The outgoing 12-hour flights to Bratislava with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ryanair">Ryanair</a> and Wizz Air have two stopovers.</p>
      <p>The Irish carrier departs <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dublin">Dublin</a> at 8.05am arriving in Frankfurt, Germany, at 11.05am.</p>
      <p>There is a four-hour wait before catching a Wizz Air flight at 3.10pm to Sofia which arrives at 6.30pm.</p>
      <p>A further two-hour wait is needed before catching a second Wizz Air flight at 8.35pm to Bratislava and that arrives at 9.10pm.</p>
      <p>The return journey is a two Ryanair flights from Bratislava to Dublin via Eindhoven lasting five hours and 25 minutes. It takes off at 8.05am with one stop in Eindhoven before arriving in Dublin at 12.30pm.</p>

      <p>Thousands of thirsty Irish fans, who saw Ireland draw against Denmark in the qualifiers on Monday, are expected to travel. And the good news for most of those who enjoy a tipple is an average pint in Bratislava will cost about €1.60.</p>
      <p>Drinks will be even cheaper in nearby Trnava.</p>
      <p>Beer prices ranges from €1 to €3 while a glass of wine will set you back from €2.50 to €10 while cocktails are priced at around €5 to €9. Bars don‘t charge entrance fees and a large number of the clubs don’t have fees either.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hotels and eating out</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rooms are very reasonable and can be snapped up for about €15 to €25 per person a night. Standard meals usually cost from €6 to €10 in Bratislava and will be a few quid cheaper in Trnava.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who are the best Slovak players?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Defensive rock Milan Skriniar has 31 caps for his country and plays as a centre-back for Inter Milan. The 24-year-old was recently linked with Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Marek Hamsik, 32, captained his nation in the 2010 World Cup during their first appearance in their history and the midfielder has scored 25 international goals in 120 appearances.</p>
