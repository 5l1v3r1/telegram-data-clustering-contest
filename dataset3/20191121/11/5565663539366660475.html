      <p>Riot police armed with baton sticks and tear gas used force to disperse opposition MDC supporters who had gathered at the party headquarters to listen to a speech by party leader Nelson Chamisa. <br/><br/>The police charged the crowd with batons and fired tear gas which caused a stamped. It is shocking that to this day, armed police and military must use force to disperse unarmed civilians who are demonstrating peacefully which is worse than the during colonial times, stated APF. <br/><br/>This is all a show of President Emmerson Mnangagwa brutality in trying to install fear to the people of Zimbabwe. He is literally adopting the heavy-handed tactics of his late predecessor, Robert Mugabe. This act shows how the government is afraid of its citizens.</p>

      <p>The President has failed to keep his promises of a new dispensation but rather it is getting worse for an average Zimbabwean citizen to live in the country. <br/><br/>The economy is in shambles with food and fuel shortages continuing to increase. It is time for this regime to realise that they cannot rule a country with a stick. All anti-government protest was banned creating a very tense environment abusing the human right act.<br/><br/><i>Rangarirai Kudakwashe Chivaviro<br/>Human rights activist</i></p>
