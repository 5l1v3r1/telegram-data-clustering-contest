      <p>On her biggest challenge in her life she had to overcome, the actress said ” For me, it is a tie between a huge, public divorce that I went through with my ex husband and my breakup with another African celebrity that had too much press behind it. I am a private person when it comes to my personal affairs so those two moments were a bit uncomfortable for me. Those experiences I also spoke about in my book “A Toast to Life” because I needed to let people know more about who I am as a woman outside of the paparazzi headlines and how I struggled and survived it all”.</p>
