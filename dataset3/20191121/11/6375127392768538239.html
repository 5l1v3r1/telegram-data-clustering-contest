      <h1>Leaving the Eagles’ lair as big winners</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:13:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/theodore-p-jurado" target="_blank">Theodore P. Jurado</a></address>
      <h3>ATENEO’s scintillating 16-0 season wouldn’t be possible without the seniors who worked hard to make history.</h3>
      <p>Thirdy Ravena, twins Mike and Matt Nieto, Isaac Go and Adrian Wong will leave the Eagles’ lair not only as champions but also as part of one of the greatest teams in UAAP men’s basketball history.</p>
      <p>“They have grown as leaders,” said Ateneo coach Tab Baldwin, describing the five players.</p>
      <p>Ravena, a three-time Finals MVP, was the glue that made this band of Eagles stick together.s.</p>
      <p>“Thirdy is an incredible competitor, he’s a fighter, he’s impetuous, he’s emotional. He can go the wrong way as easily he can go the right way. Fortunately for us, he so often goes that just by weight of numbers, he goes the right way a lot,” said Baldwin.</p>
      <p>“Mike is probably a natural leader. Mike is a communicator. Mike is a thinker. This guy right here (Matt) , he’s something between a brother and a son, certainly a friend. You can just put a W on his head. He’s a winner. He wins all the time,” he added.</p>
      <p>Go, whose clutch baskets in the post-season two years ago jumpstarted Ateneo’s three-peat, simply embraced his role to the team.</p>
      <p>“As we go through this group, George (Go) is a guy that I didn’t expect a lot from George from the beginning. I knew he was intelligent. But what he has in terms of the context of our team, he has respect from everybody, including all the coaches, for a person who gives everything he has to give, and we want more,” said Baldwin.</p>
      <p>One of the most underappreciated players in the squad, Wong was also solid for the Eagles all-season long and for Baldwin, his presence inside the court will be sorely missed.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really have a lot to say because I really didn’t think that I was gonna lose him. I thought he was gonna stay for another year. I told him I will support him in whatever he did. I haven’t told him this but it hurt when he told he was leaving. I hate losing him,” said Baldwin of Wong.</p>
      <p>Ateneo may have swept University of Santo Tomas, but Baldwin had commanded high respects on his counterpart Aldin Ayo in a duel of the league’s brightest coaching minds.</p>
      <p>Though the Kiwi-American had outwitted the Sorsogon native for the second straight Finals, Baldwin was all praises for Ayo.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t easy. It was extremely difficult and I think I’ve said enough times Aldin and his team they come at you hard,” said Baldwin.    </p>
      <p>It won’t be a surprise if Baldwin and Ayo will meet again in the league’s biggest stage.</p>
      <p>For the meantime, the Eagles can finally celebrate this remarkable feat and for Ravena and company to relish the moment after  months of hard work.</p>
