      <h1>Twelve years later, how do you feel about the first Kindle?</h1>
      <h2>Take a look back at what the Amazon e-reader did right (or wrong) with a user review.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/amber-bouman" target="_blank">Amber Bouman</a></address>
      <p>This past Tuesday marked the 12-year anniversary of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/Amazon/kindle/1st-gen/">first Amazon Kindle</a>, which was praised at the time as an evolutionary step forward for e-readers thanks to its high-contrast screen, SD slot and built-in 3G or WiFi. However, now it just seems clunky and cluttered in comparison to this year's <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/04/10/amazon-kindle-review-2019/">minimalist, streamlined version</a>.</p>
      <p>With a weight of 10.3 ounces and a height of 7.5 inches, the original Kindle was a beast compared to the 6.1 ounces and 6.3 inches of this year's model. But there was still plenty to adore about the first-generation Amazon e-reader -- if you loved yours, we want to hear why in a user review. Tell us all the details about your experiences with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/Amazon/kindle/1st-gen/">first Kindle</a>, what worked, what was disappointing and how you feel about it compared to more modern e-readers. Remember, your retro review could be included in an upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/08/samsung-galaxy-buds-user-reviews/">user review roundup</a> so don't leave anything out!</p>
