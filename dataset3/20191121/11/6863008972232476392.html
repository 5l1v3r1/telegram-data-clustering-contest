      <p>Ukraine marks the sixth anniversary of the Revolution of Dignity on November 21, 2019. The end of November is when the Orange Revolution started in 2004 and the Revolution of Dignity in 2013.</p>
      <p>These events have changed Ukraine's history. One of the most tragic events for Ukrainians was the struggle for justice, which began six years ago with protest rallies on Maidan Nezalezhnosti, or Independence Square, in the center of Kyiv. Later, the rallies grew into the Revolution of Dignity and Freedom. The protest in downtown Kyiv was called Euromaidan, and the most active participants were students. A few days later, a peaceful rally turned into a brutal massacre at night. The Revolution of Dignity and Freedom has become one of the most tragic pages in the history of modern Ukraine and forever changed the country and the nation.</p>
