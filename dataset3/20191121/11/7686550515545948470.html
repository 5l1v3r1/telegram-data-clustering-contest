      <h1>Labour is promising to build 100,000 council houses but the Labour Welsh Government built just 57 last year</h1>
      <h2>Labour has been in power in Wales since devolution</h2>

      <p>Labour has promised to build 100,000 council homes if it is elected into Government at next month's election.</p>
      <p>It's one of the promises made in the party's manifesto - to "scale up council house building so that we are building 100,000 council homes a year by the end of the parliament, a more than 3,500% increase".</p>
      <p>The homes would be built to "cutting edge design and green standards" and cost £75bn over five years.</p>
      <p>However, it has been criticised because last year in Wales - where <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> runs the Welsh Government - just 57 council houses were built.</p>
      <p>Housing is an area which is devolved to Wales.</p>
      <p>Only six council houses were built between April and June of this year.</p>
      <p>In the same period, 367 new homes for social landlords were built.</p>

      <p>Jeremy Corbyn has said that housing "should be for the many, not a speculation opportunity for dodgy landlords and the wealthy few".</p>
      <p>"I am determined to create a society where working class communities and young people have access to affordable, good quality council and social homes.</p>
      <p>"Everyone knows someone affected by the housing crisis. Labour is offering real change to fix it."</p>
      <p>Welsh Labour, which has a different position to the main party on Brexit, will publish a separate manifesto.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/plaid-cymru">Plaid Cymru</a> has criticised the pledge, saying it would take 100 years for Labour to deliver the promise.</p>
      <p>Liz Saville Roberts, standing for re-election in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-candidates-dwyfor-meirionnydd-16933294">Dwyfor Meirionnydd,</a> said: "The figures speak for themselves. Here in Wales, where Labour is in government, only 57 new council houses have been built in the last year. At this rate, actually delivering this pledge would take almost 100 years.</p>
      <p>"Sadly, we in Wales know all too well that what Labour says and what Labour does are two very different things. We’ve had 20 years of Labour government here and their record is clear: very little style, and even less substance.</p>
      <p>"Whether it’s council housing, social care, or protecting the NHS, Labour has failed to do in Wales what it promises elsewhere. Labour just can’t be trusted to do what it says it will do, so it’s time to put our trust in Plaid Cymru – Wales’ party – to solve our challenges and transform our country."</p>
      <p>Welsh Labour and the Welsh Government have both been contacted for comment.</p>
