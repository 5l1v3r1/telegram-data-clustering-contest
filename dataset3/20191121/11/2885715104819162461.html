      <p>T-Series head honcho Bhushan Kumar and wife, actor Divya Khosla Kumar celebrated the success of T-Series’ latest single “Yaad Piya Ki Aane Lagi” on Wednesday. The single is a recreation of Falguni Pathak’s iconic 1999 song.</p>
      <p>While the song has taken the internet by storm, it has also received some flak.</p>
      <p>Talking about the criticism, Bhushan Kumar said, “We launched this song three-four days ago and it has more than thirty million views (on YouTube). Today, many people criticize the trend of song recreation. Lalit Sen (music composer of the original song performed by Falguni Pathak) praised the re-composition. He is the best judge. If he is appreciating it, then it means that we have done a good job. So people who are criticizing the song should stop as we have made it for this generation. The original song released a long time ago, and people enjoyed it then as well. Now, we have revisited it, and many people including the original composer Lalit Sen and Falguni (Pathak) are happy about the recreation. Many people have criticized it, but there is a large audience that we cater to. So I am really happy with the kind of response the song has been receiving. I am very thankful to my audience.”</p>

      <p>Divya Khosla Kumar, who was also celebrating her birthday, reminisced how the 1999 song with Falguni Pathak was her first “big break”.</p>
      <p>She said, “I was cast in a Falguni Pathak video which was the first big break for me. And again I have done a video of a Falguni Pathak song. I want to thank Falguni for being so generous. I am thankful for all the positive wishes she has given. She has supported the decision of recreating her song for the new generation. I am very happy with the response the video has received.”</p>
      <p>Composer Lalit Sen, who was present at the success bash, added, “I am a T-Series baby and Gulshan (Kumar) ji gave me the chance. I have done a lot of albums for them. I am fortunate that Vinay (Sapru) ji and Radhika (Rao) ji have directed this song again and Tanishk (Bagchi) has done a beautiful job. He has added more value to it. I really liked the recreation. Usually as a critic, I always look out for errors or loopholes, but this song is complete entertainment.”</p>
