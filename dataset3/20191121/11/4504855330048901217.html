      <p>Cheetah is partnering with volunteers of Rodriguez Charities to provide the 3,000 turkeys.</p>
      <p>“In efforts to extend this offer to as many people as possible, they are limiting one turkey per household on a first come first serve basis, while supplies last,” the club wrote on Instagram.</p>
