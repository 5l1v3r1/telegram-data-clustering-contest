      <p>Opening the ceremony at Shrewsbury's Shirehall was Local Policing Chief Superintendent Tom Harding, who said it was 'an honour to be able to present awards to not only our officers and staff who have gone above and beyond their duty, but also members of the public who have put other people before themselves to help protect someone from harm'.</p>
      <p>“These awards have been given for the extraordinary efforts individuals and teams have gone in displaying bravery, commitment and dedication to protect people from harm and make our communities even safer," he said.</p>
      <p>"They are incredibly well deserved and behalf of the Chief Constable and the whole force I would like to congratulate and thank everyone who has been presented with an award and am delighted to be able to recognise these achievements.</p>
      <p>"The work of those who have been recognised is an example of the work officers and staff carry out 24/7 365 days a year to ensure we deliver the best possible service to our communities and protect people from harm.”</p>
      <p>Some of the Chief Superintendent Commendations presented included:</p>

      </ul>
