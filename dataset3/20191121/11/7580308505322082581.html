      <p>Nigerian singers, Danny Young and Tiwa Savage have settled their legal battle out of court.</p>
      <p>We reported earlier that<a href="https://guardian.ng/life/danny-youngs-n200m-suit-against-tiwa-savage-marvin-records-gets-court-date/"> Danny Young filed a N200 million copyright suit against Savage</a> for her 2018 song, ‘One’, which he claimed she copied from his 2009 single, “Oju Tiwon”.</p>
      <p>In the suit, he sought a declaration that by copying, performing, and distributing literary work and music lyrics authored and owned by him without lawful authority, the defendants have infringed on his copyright.</p>
      <p>He also sought an order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants, whether by themselves or their agents, from further copying, performing, recording, reproducing, or communicating to the public, his musical composition.</p>
      <p>In the suit that was filed in February, Danny Young also joined Tiwa Savage’s former record label, Mavin Records, owned by Don Jazzy.</p>
      <p>In an update to the story, Danny Young has revealed that they have settled out of court. He made this known today on his Instagram page.</p>
      <p>In a statement signed by his lawyers, the singer commended Tiwa’s management “for committing in good faith, time and efforts towards finding an amicable resolution to the dispute.”</p>
      <p>The statement reads in part:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“Mutual efforts in this regard have been successful and our client and the defendants, Tiwa Savage and Mavin Records, have come to a common understanding and agreed on the terms for the discontinuation of the suit. Therefore we shall no longer be proceeding with the court action.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>According to Young’s lawyer, Justin Ige, the decision to settle out of court stemmed from the respondents (Tiwa Savage &amp; Mavin Records) reaching out to his client and requesting that the case be settled out of court.</p>
      <p>Both parties considered an out-of-court settlement for the first time at a Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos on November 6.</p>
