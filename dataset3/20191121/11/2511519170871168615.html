      <h1>Poundland is no longer a pound shop as it ditches £1 price promise</h1>
      <h2>Items can now cost up to £10 - but there's more on offer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:25:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">Moya Lothian-McLean</a></address>
      <p>Poundland dropped their familiar slogan of “Everything’s £1” after <a href="https://www.talkingretail.com/news/industry-news/poundland-introduces-simple-pricing-time-christmas-20-11-2019/">changes to their pricing structure</a> means everything is no longer £1.  </p>
      <p>Instead, Poundland stores across the UK will see items priced between 50p and £5 from Thursday, although selected items could cost up to £10. </p>
      <p>The move comes after a successful trial across 24 West Midlands store in August, which saw products like 75p toothpaste and £2 shampoo go on sale. </p>
      <p>At the time, Poundland managing director Barry Williams <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/13/poundlands-new-pricing-structure-means-youll-be-asking-how-much-is-that-10561266/">said the store</a> was moving from poundshop to “simple price retailer” in line with changing customer demand</p>
      <p>Although the retailer has previously offered special deals on products priced above £1, this is a permanent change. </p>
      <p>The new pricing structure means 75 per cent of items will retain their £1 price tag but a wider range of goods can be offered to consumers.</p>
      <p>“Our shoppers love the amazing value we provide and now we can begin bringing that value on wider ranges that they now can find in stores for the first time,” said <a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2019/11/poundland-rolls-simple-pricing-offer-nationwide/">Barry Williams in a statement</a>.</p>
      <p>“Our team of talented buyers has moved heaven and earth to bring these ranges to store in time for Christmas and I’d like to thank them for all their hard work.”</p>
      <p>Poundland’s decision arrives after a particularly tough year for the British high street, in which <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=5795&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/11/retailers-call-for-action-as-high-street-store-closures-soar">16 shops closed their doors every day</a> during the first half of 2019. </p>
      <p>Business owners blame factors online shopping and high business rates for the record numbers of empty stores found on UK high streets. </p>
      <p>Over 50 retailers - including John Lewis and Harrods - <a href="https://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2019/08/chancellor-sajid-javid-cold-shoulder-business-rates-reform-plea-brc/">wrote to Chancellor Sajid Javid</a> in August, calling for “fundamental” reform of sky high business rates. </p>
      <p>Conservative election pledges by Boris Johnson to “review” rates have <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/tory-business-rates-review-fails-to-convince-sz2n5g8hz">come under criticism</a> for not going far enough. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50459541">say they will</a> scrap rates altogether, while Labour have promised to reform the rates, with leader Jeremy Corbyn citing the "damage they're currently doing to our high streets and communities".</p>
