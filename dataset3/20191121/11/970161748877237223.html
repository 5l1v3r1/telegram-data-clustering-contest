      <p>Samuel L Jackson’s new movie The Banker’s world premiere has been pulled following allegations about the producer and son of the main character in the film, Bernard Garrett.</p>
      <p>The Banker is Apple’s first major film release, starring Jackson, Nicholas Hoult, Anthony Mackie, Nia Long and Jessie Usher, and was set to have its world premiere at the closing of AFI Fest tonight.</p>
      <p>However, the screening has been cancelled following allegations from Cynthia and Sheila Garrett, who claim they were sexually molested by their half-brother Bernard Garrett Jr – whose father is played by Mackie in The Banker.</p>
      <p>A statement from Apple read: ‘We purchased The Banker earlier this year as we were moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy.</p>

      <p>‘Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.</p>

      <p>‘In light of this, we are no longer premiering The Banker at AFI Fest.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/apple-canceled-banker-premiere-sexual-abuse-claims-real-life-subjects-son-1256695">According to The Hollywood Reporter,</a> Garret Jr’s half-sisters, who are 15 years his junior, have made Apple aware of their claim that they were sexually molested by him when they were children.</p>
      <p>They also allege that the timeline of The Banker was changed to leave the girls and their mother out of the story, saying that scenes featuring Garrett Sr’s first wife happened after he had divorced her in real life.</p>
      <p>Garrett Jr was credited as a co-producer on The Banker, and appeared on stage with director George Nolfi at an entertainment industry event on 5 November.</p>

      <p>However, his credit is no longer in publicity material for the film, and an attorney for Romulus Entertainment told THR that Garrett Jr stepped down as producer to avoid taking attention away from his father’s story.</p>
      <p>The Banker is based on the true story of Bernard Garrett (Mackie) and Joe Morris (Jackson), who enlist a white man (Hoult) to pose as the face of their business as they attempt to build an empire.</p>
      <p>It has been replaced by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson’s Marriage Story at AFI Fest.</p>
