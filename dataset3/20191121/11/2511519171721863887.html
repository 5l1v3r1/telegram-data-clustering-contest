      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/matilde-hidalgo">Matilde Hidalgo</a>, the pioneering <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/doctor">doctor</a>, poet and women’s rights activist, is being honoured with a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/google_doodle">Google Doodle</a> today to mark what would have been her 130th birthday.</p>
      <p>Born in the Ecuadorian city of Loja on this day in 1889, she was the youngest of six children raised by her mother Carmen Navarro, a widowed seamstress.</p>
      <p>At a time when girls were expected to finish their education at the age of 11, Hidalgo spoke of her desire to be allowed to continue her studies at high school.</p>
      <p>Although her request was granted, Hidalgo faced prejudice in her community and was ostracised by her peers, with mothers telling their daughters not to befriend her.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless she persevered with her studies and graduated with honours in 1913, also became a published poet, writing about topics including science, nature and love.</p>
      <p>She went on to study medicine at university and made history by becoming <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Ecuador">Ecuador</a>’s first female doctor.</p>
      <p>After earning her degree, Hidalgo turned her attention to politics and became a passionate campaigner for women’s suffrage.</p>
      <p>She announced her intention to vote in Ecuador’s 1924 presidential election by adding her name to the country’s electoral roll.</p>
      <p>After being challenged by the government, Hidalgo pointed out that Ecuador’s constitution made no mention of gender as a requirement for voting, only citizenship, age and literacy.</p>
      <p>She was then granted the right to cast her ballot, becoming the first woman in any <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/LatinAmerica">Latin American</a> country to vote in a national election, paving the way for universal suffrage.</p>
      <p>In 1941 Hidalgo again wrote her name into history as Ecuador’s first female elected official, when she became a public administrator in Loja.</p>
      <p>After her death in 1974 her hometown established a museum in her honour, while she was awarded two prestigious titles by the government, the Medal of Merit and the Medal of Public Health.</p>
