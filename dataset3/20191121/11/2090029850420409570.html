      <p>A group of Primary school boys have melted the hearts of many after they were photographed spending time with their friend in the hospital.</p>
      <p>The school boys and friends too permission from the school authorities to visit the hospital where one of their friends who was involved in a motorbike accident on his way to school was being treated.</p>

      <p>The boys were seen sitting around their friend who had sustained injuries to his leg who needed crutches to walk around easily. This obviously made the boy emotional as his friends were starring at his injured leg with sadness in their faces.</p>
      <p>The picture taken was shared by a social media user, Shariff Yeng and it is fast going viral. He shared the picture with caption;</p>
      <blockquote>I came across these boys discussing stuff and laughing all around at the hospital-TTH. I asked what happened and i was told the boy in Red was knocked down by a motorbike on his way to school. So his friends took permission from school to come see him and have a moment with their friend. It was just so beautiful and it showed me what friendship should beüòç</blockquote>
