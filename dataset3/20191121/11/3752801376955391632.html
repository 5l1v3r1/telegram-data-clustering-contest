      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:40:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Azarrah Karrim</a></address>
      <p>The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (the Hawks) has arrested 10 people in connection with collusion allegations involving Amathole District Municipality funds.</p>
      <p>They are expected to appear in the East London Magistrate's Court on Friday on charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>"The operation follows a complaint by the national Treasury after it transpired that the suspects allegedly colluded in accessing the Amathole District Municipality funds through the flaunting of procurement processes. Afterwards, they were awarded a contract for ventilated, improved toilets in the Eastern Cape," Hawks spokesperson Colonel Katlego Mogale said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mogale added: "The Hawks' preliminary investigation discovered that over R600m was to be awarded for the contract, of which R286m [ was already] paid to the suspects."</p>
      <p>The arrests were made after a multi-disciplinary team, which included Crime Intelligence and SA Police Service detectives, conducted several raids across the country, including in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal.</p>
