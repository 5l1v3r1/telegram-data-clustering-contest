      <h1>Mixed reaction to Glasgow's appointment of Wilson as Rennie's successor</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:44:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:44</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Raisey</a></address>
      <p>Glasgow Warriors always faced a challenge replacing a coach of the calibre of Dave Rennie when he left.</p>
      <p>So when it was announced this week that he would be leaving last season’s PRO14 runners-up to take over <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/australia">Australia</a> at the end of this season, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/rather-than-check-out-the-market-glasgow-have-already-opted-to-promote-from-within/">the Warriors were quick to appoint </a><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/scotland">Scotland</a> forwards coach Danny Wilson, but this has not been universally popular.</p>
      <p>Wilson has an impressive resume, having had successful spells with both <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> under-20 and Cardiff <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/blues">Blues</a> in the past, leading the latter to the Challenge Cup in 2018. He also guided Wales to a third-place finish in the under-20 World Championship.</p>
      <p>Given the success that he had in Cardiff, many <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/glasgow">Glasgow</a> fans back Wilson to have more success at Scotstoun as he is inheriting a better squad (if both teams are based on last season’s performance alone).</p>
      <p>Wilson is also thought of very highly by those from Cardiff, who recognise what a success his time at Cardiff was, helping the Blues return to the Champions Cup after a four-year exile.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, many Glaswegians are hoping that with funding and backing from the club, something he may not have received with Cardiff, he can maintain the side’s growth which they have shown over the past few years.</p>
      <p>However, there are those that are a bit more sceptical about this deal. Ultimately, being a two-time <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> winner, Rennie was always a hard act to follow.</p>
      <p>Moreover, some fear that the brand of rugby that the Kiwi has established in Glasgow will now go with the arrival of someone that may be less expansive.</p>
      <p>That may come down to who Wilson has in his coaching team, however, and does not mean that the Warriors will lose their high-tempo style of play.</p>

      <p>What has concerned Glasgow fans as well is the performance of Scotland’s forwards since Wilson joined Gregor Townsend’s coaching team in 2018. If anything, some have accused the Scotland team of regressing, which does not look encouraging.</p>

      <p>What is clear is that there is a fairly mixed reception to this news, but Wilson will arrive at the Warriors already with an understanding and relationship with many of the players from his time with the national team. That may make the process of acclimatising much easier.</p>
