      <h1>Harry Redknapp suggests Chris Wilder and Eddie Howe as potential Arsenal bosses</h1>
      <h2>Current Gunners boss Unai Emery is coming under serious pressure right now.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:15:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has named Eddie Howe and Chris Wilder as options to manage Arsenal as Unai Emery comes under increasing pressure.</p>
      <p>Wilder, 52, led Sheffield United to a 1-0 win over Arsenal at Bramall Lane last month, while Howe has been impressing in the Premier League with Bournemouth since 2015.</p>
      <p>In the<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7706395/Harry-Redknapp-blasts-Unai-Emery-letting-poor-group-players-decide-Arsenals-captain.html"> Daily Mail, Redknapp said</a>: “I’ve got to be honest, I don’t think Emery can turn things around. What amazes me, every time a top managerial job comes up, you have to go to someone big. That about the kid at Sheffield United, [Chris] Wilder, what about Eddie Howe? These kind of people.</p>
      <p>“You haven’t got to be a genius to look at Arsenal and go hang on, they need a couple of central defenders and they need a midfielder player, but they keep buying forwards.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Wilder or Howe would do a better job of offering an identity and fixing Arsenal’s weaknesses</h3>
      <p>Howe’s Bournemouth side have had a clear identity for a number of years and are now working on the defensive side of their game.</p>
      <p>Emery’s Arsenal do not have a clear idea of what they’re trying to do, in either attack or defence, unlike Wilder’s Sheffield United side, who were superior in every aspect back in October.</p>
      <p>That said, it’s unlikely they will be on the shortlist whenever Emery is removed from his post, because they will seek European experience because the club wants to get back into the Champions League.</p>
