      <p>The king of romance – Shah Rukh Khan has given his fans many memorable films. From <i>Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</i> to <i>Don</i>, the actor has donned many new avatars that people have fallen in love with. Amongst the many characters he has essayed on the bug screen, his double role in <i>Duplicate</i> is still considered as one of his best performances.</p>
      <p>But did you know that Kajol, who we all love to see SRK with, had a cameo in his film! Yes, you read that right. It was a scene where Shah Rukh Khan Shah Rukh goes to drop Farida Jalal at the station.</p>

      <p>The scene begins with Shah Rukh dropping his mother – Farida Jalal at the station and being upset because of her departure. While Farida is busy instructing a coolie and telling him where to keep her bags in the train, Shah Rukh Khan is busy whining about her leaving.</p>
      <p>He says, ” It is okay if you want to leave. I will also not eat food, will not express himself and will marry an ugly girl.” And just as he finishes his monologue, Kajol passes by him. The iconic song from <i>Dilwale Dhulania Le Jayega</i> plays and Shah Rukh asks her, “Behenji Kya Aap Mujhse Shaadi Krengi?” Kajol’s replies with a hilarious answer. She says, “Chee. No.” and leaves the scene shouting Raj’s name.</p>

      <p>Well, that is a very pleasant throwback and only makes us wish to see the duo on the screen again. The two were last seen in Rohit Shetty’s Dilwale.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Shah Rukh Khan is yet to announce his next project. However, he is a part of Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt, Amitabh Bachchan starrer Brahmastra. Shah Rukh will appear in a cameo role in the film. As for Kajol, she will be seen in <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> starring Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan.</p>
