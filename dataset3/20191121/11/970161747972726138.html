      <h1>Tories' £15,000,000 for rape cases 'doesn't go far enough'</h1>

      <p>Campaigners have welcomed the Conservatives’ £15 million pledge to boost rape cases, but warned victims are still getting ‘nowhere near enough’ support.</p>
      <p>The Tories announced the funding to support police and the Crown Prosecution Service in handling rape cases and speeding up prosecutions should they win next month’s election.</p>
      <p>While the promise of much-needed funding was welcome, there are calls for all political parties to address what they will do to reform a system that is ‘not fit for purpose’.</p>
      <p>It comes amid the latest in a series of law and order proposals, including increasing stop-and-search powers for police to tackle knife crime and making child murderers serve whole-life sentences.</p>
      <p>A ‘root-and-branch review’ of the parole system would include allowing victims and the media to apply to attend parole hearings.</p>
      <p>The reforms are intended to make the system more transparent following controversy over the case of John Worboys, whose parole was challenged by victims.</p>

      <p>The package includes £10 million to speed up charging decisions, a double in funding for the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Fund and £2 million to increase the number of independent sexual violence advisers.</p>

      <p>It would also include a previous funding pledge of £5 million that has yet to kick in.</p>
      <p>Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the funding boost would help those who have been through ‘horrific and harrowing experiences’.</p>
      <p>‘They may have had their lives ripped apart because of physical, emotional or economic abuse,’ she said.</p>
      <p>‘These plans will help to ensure that the system is working for them, not against them, and that they can always count on receiving the justice and support that they deserve.’</p>
      <p>Sarah Green, Director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, greeted the pledge.</p>
      <p>But she cautioned it is ‘critical’ the money is not ‘swallowed up by setting unhelpful targets on cases to speed them along, or by scrolling through reams of digital evidence without consideration of whether that evidence is necessary’.</p>
      <p>She also called for an end to the ‘misconceptions and prejudice in the system’ which ‘leads to cases being dropped’ and radical reforms to the way rape is investigated and prosecuted.</p>
      <p>‘While the announcement is significant, the fact is that rape is an extremely common crime and we are nowhere near either the levels of support needed or the leadership required on challenging attitudes towards, and excuses for, rape,’ Ms Green said.</p>
      <p>‘The system at present is not fit for purpose and we have the effective decriminalisation of rape.</p>

      <p>‘In addition, many thousands of survivors of sexual assault in childhood and as adults never get the support which can really make a difference and which should be there as a right.’</p>
      <p>Richard Atkins QC, Chair of the Bar Council, which represents all barristers in England and Wales, said any investment into the ‘massively underfunded criminal justice system’ is welcome.</p>
      <p>But he questioned whether targeting one particular type of crime is sustainable.</p>
      <p>‘The reality is that more police officers are required to investigate all crimes,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘More Crown Prosecution Service lawyers and staff are required to make charging decisions and to put the cases together.</p>
      <p>‘More courts and court rooms need to be open to cut the backlog of cases that are currently clogging up the system and leading to cases being heard many months or years after the alleged offence was committed.</p>
      <p>‘There needs to be better care of all victims of crime.’</p>
      <p>Ms Green also urged each political party to ‘set out clearly what they will do to make this a priority from day one’ and set out their intentions for the Domestic Abuse Bill.</p>
      <p>It was introduced with cross-party support by Theresa May’s government in July and proposes the first Government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour.</p>

      <p>Another bill set to be revived in a Tory Queen’s Speech is the Prisoners (Disclosure Of Information About Victims) Bill, known as Helen’s Law, which would make it a legal requirement for the Parole Board to take into account a killer’s failure to disclose the location of their victim’s remains when considering them for release.</p>
      <p>It is named after Helen McCourt, whose body has never been found after she was killed in 1988.</p>
