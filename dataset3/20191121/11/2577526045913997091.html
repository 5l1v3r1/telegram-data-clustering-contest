      <h1>Sea of Thieves' Fiery New Update Lets You Unleash Your Inner Pyro</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:40:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Things are quite literally heating up in <i>Sea of Thieves</i>, as the game’s latest update - The Seabound Soul - introduces a whole bunch of different ways to set fire to things. As well as new cosmetics and the next Tall Tale, players will soon be able to lob firebombs at one another.</p>
      <p>Firebombs can be loaded into cannons and shot at other players’ ships, where they have a pretty destructive impact if left unchecked. If you fancy getting a little more up-close-and-personal, however, they can also be thrown directly at people, molotov-cocktail style. Fires start small, but over time can engulf entire ships in roaring flames and belching smoke. You can put those smaller fires out with relative ease (larger conflagrations will be a little trickier to manage), but you might want to make sure you have a bucket of water close at hand.</p>

      <p>The Seabound Soul also introduces the first Tall Tale since April’s inaugural adventure. This time out, players will be working alongside the legendary Captain Pendragon to uncover the mystery of the ghostly Ashen Dragon. More importantly, however, your inner pyromaniac will be even better served, thanks to your new-found ability to build campfires: perfect for cooking on-the-go.</p>
