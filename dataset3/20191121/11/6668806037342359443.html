      <p>Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan has been ruling our hearts for more than three decades now. The actor not just has a massive fan following in India but all over the world. Interestingly, what makes him a lot more special is the love he sends out to his fans time and again.

      <p>It all happened when SRK took to his social media handle to congratulate one of the acid attack victims associated with his organisation as she tied the knot.  The 54-year-old actor wrote, “Congratulations and my love to Anupama as she starts on this new journey of life. May it be filled with love light and laughter. U r the man Jagdeep...and may u both have double the reasons to be happy with this union.</p>
      <p>Along with this he even shared some pictures with the lovely lady. Take a look.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, on the work front, the actor will begin shooting for Atlee’s directorial in March 2020. Touted to be an out-an-out-action film, it will feature King Khan in a never-seen-before avatar. When asked about working with SRK, the filmmaker told a leading daily, “I have a huge amount of love and respect for SRK sir and he also loves my work. Soon, hopefully, we will do something about it.”</p>
