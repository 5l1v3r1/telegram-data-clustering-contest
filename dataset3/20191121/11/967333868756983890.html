      <p>Russian mixed martial arts fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov has shared his feelings about the iconic victory over his Irish rival Conor McGregor last October.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a Q&amp;A session with fans, the Dagestani confessed that he had mixed emotions.</p>
      <blockquote>"What was going on in my head when I was declared winner? Don't you remember? I was at a locker room at that moment. Guarded by 300 security personnel. Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin called me and asked me how I was doing. And I told him: 'I'm in the facilities under the stands surrounded by 300 guards - I don't know, they are probably going to beat me, I guess'. Overall, I had some mixed emotions at that moment", the 31-year-old fighter said.</blockquote>

      <p>He also dismissed McGregor's <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201910241077133932-conor-mcgregor-holds-press-conference-in-moscow---video/">recent statements</a> of a rematch, saying it is unlikely that the Irishman is actually seeking to face him again.</p>
      <blockquote>"I don't honestly think that he wants a rematch. He was beaten and strangled for four rounds. He also threw some punches and he wanted for this to be over", the champion concluded.</blockquote>
      <p>Nurmagomedov vs McGregor was the highlight of UFC 229 in Las Vegas in October 2018. Russia's fighter triumphed in the 4th round. </p>
      <p>However, both men <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201911011077201456-mma-star-conor-mcgregor-convicted-of-punching-man-in-dublin-pub-issued-thousand-euro-fine---report/">engaged in a brawl</a> outside the octagon that saw McGregor suspended for six months while Nurmagomedov was handed a nine-month suspension.</p>
