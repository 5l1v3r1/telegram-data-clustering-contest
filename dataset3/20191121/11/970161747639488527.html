      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caroline-flack/">Caroline Flack</a> looked chuffed as pie to land back in Blighty after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> filming in Cape Town, as she was greeted with a big ol’ smooch from boyfriend Lewis Burton.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caroline-flack-heads-cape-town-filming-winter-love-island-officially-begins-11181828/">presenter had been in South Africa</a> as prep for the winter version of the reality show kicked into gear, with a whistlestop tour of her latest office.</p>
      <p>Rolling a suitcase through the arrivals terminal in Heathrow this week, Caroline was flanked by her crew as she sported a bright grin on her return to London.</p>
      <p>Perhaps she’d just seen who was waiting for her on the other side of passport control?</p>
      <p>Chilling with the chauffeurs, tennis player Lewis was patiently awaiting the return of his love as he embraced Caroline, who was dressed for the chill in a green coat, tights and boots.</p>

      <p>Hey, who cares who’s watching when you’re in love, right?</p>
      <p>The star began dating her model beau earlier this year, with the pair going strong as they enjoyed a romantic getaway to Ibiza.</p>

      <p>And even though they’ve not been shy in showing off their love,<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/06/caroline-flack-100-not-engaged-boyfriend-lewis-burton-everyone-can-calm-11054156/"> they are ‘100% not engaged’</a>, you got it?</p>
      <p>After the two <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/02/caroline-flack-tennis-player-lewis-burton-go-instagram-official-kissing-ibiza-10507606/">made their relationship Instagram official back in August</a>, a source told The Sun: ‘Caroline and Lewis were introduced through mutual friends and have really hit it off. They’ve been on several dates now and are getting on really well.</p>
      <p>‘Lewis has been a true gent to Caroline and has patiently waited to see her.’</p>
      <p>Burton is the first guy Caroline has been linked to since her brief fling with Danny Cipriani ended, as the TV presenter confirmed she was ‘dating’ following her split last year from fiance Andrew Brady.</p>
      <p>She told OK! magazine: ‘I’m dating. Even though I’ve had ups and downs in my love life, I do still adore love.’</p>
      <p>Hear hear!</p>
      <p>You know what she probably doesn’t love right now? The inside of an airplane.</p>

      <p>Only two days ago the presenter revealed she was overseas as we prepared for the next season of the ITV smash to hit screens.</p>

      <p>While the series isn’t scheduled to hit screens until early next year, Caroline recently confirmed she was already working on her part – which included some rather heinously-long 13-hour flights to South Africa.</p>
      <p>The flagship summer series is based in Spain, only a couple hours flight away, where Caroline can easily dip in and out of the villa, do some classic slow-motion walks and hair flicks, while also hosting the regular Aftersun programme.</p>

      <p>That’s all a little more complicated now she’s got a longer commute ahead of her.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/caroline-flack-dreading-juggling-winter-love-island-in-south-africa-and-uk-aftersun-as-filming-kicks-off-this-weekend-11091430/">Speaking to Metro.co.uk</a> at the recent ITV Palooza in London, the ever-positive Caroline explained her jam-packed schedule.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a 13 hour flight [to South Africa],’ the Flack Attack said.</p>
      <p>’I’ve got to go back and forth the whole time to do Aftersun over here.</p>
      <p>The former X Factor host also shared that it’s ‘a long old flight just to do that walking’,  but at least that’s the optimum time to binge-watch The Crown, right?</p>
      <p>Winter Love Island will see the famous villa in Majorca swapped for the sunny shores of South Africa as another group of British singletons fly out in the hopes of finding true love.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>The new series is not without its controversies, however, as former contestant Yewande Biala is convinced the winter version of the show will actually flop.</p>
      <p>‘Because it’s once a year, you can’t miss it, you have to watch it [while] on Twitter,’ she said. ‘Everyone is so hooked because you don’t want to miss that day. Whereas if it’s all the time, you’re like “It doesn’t matter, there’s going to be another one in two months’ time”.’</p>
      <p>Eh, don’t be so sure! We cannot wait.</p>
