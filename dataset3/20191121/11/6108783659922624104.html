      <h1>Google Stadia data usage more than 7GB/hr in 1080p: report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:36:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:36</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wright</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/stadia/">Google Stadia</a> has been released in several regions around the world, and as such outlets are able to assess its real-world data usage.</p>
      <p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/11/19/google-stadia-data-usage/">VentureBeat</a> has calculated that <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/red-dead-redemption-2/"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></a> uses more than 7GB per hour while streaming in 1080p. The figure was attained by tethering Stadia controller and a Chromecast to an Android smartphone, then using the Android’s in-build data reporting feature. That method says <i>RDR2 </i>uses 1.55GB of data over 13 minutes, streaming in 1080p at 60 frames-per-second.</p>
      <p>Google has yet to comment on the report, but one thing’s for sure: if you’re using Stadia with a data cap, you’d best be careful.</p>
      <p>There’s no word yet as to when Aussies will be able to get there hands on <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/stadia/">Stadia</a>.</p>
