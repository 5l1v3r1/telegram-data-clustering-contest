      <p>Want-away forward, Gareth Bale, has intensified effort to force a move away from Real Madrid after the Welshman celebrated his country's Euro 202 qualification with a controversial flag, fueling his strained relationship with the Spanish giants.</p>
      <p>Bale gave football fans a glimpse of his brilliance after the 30-year-old put in a vital impressive performance as Wales demolished Hungary 2-0 to clinch Euro 2020 ticket in style.</p>
      <p>But the winger courted controversy to himself and fueled the friction between him and his employers after he was seen with flag bearing a controversial inscription "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."</p>

      <p>Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane was reported to have been angered by Bale's utter disrespect for the club but he would not penalize him for the behaviour, Sportbible reports.</p>
      <p>The former Tottenham star has been neck-deep in volatile whirlpool of controversy since falling down the pecking order with Spanish giants management.</p>
      <p>Bale is reportedly seeking a January move from the club after his massive money transfer was truncated by Real Madrid during the summer transfer.</p>
      <p>Zidane is reportedly willing to overlook Bale's controversy to avoid more strained relationship with the winger.</p>
