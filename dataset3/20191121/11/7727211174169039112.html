      <p>With match fishing winter leagues well under way this month, there’s a notable excitement flowing across over the region today as competitors recognise that the door is still open towards possible success as their respected competitions get interesting.</p>
      <p>It’s understood that match fishing at every level always involves a great deal of preparation and a constant examination of the use of particular techniques for a venue.</p>
      <p>Wherever that venue may be, developing a strategy with a positive mental attitude is crucial towards being successful.</p>
      <p>Understanding the importance of tackle to be used and the precise information on what baits are to be required and when to use them, essentially these are natural questions we have to ask ourselves before setting out anywhere.</p>
      <p>On the canal scene this weekend, with a cold early morning frost greeting us on both days, as expected many anglers had already switched towards winter mode with Hall Lane, Maghull the venue for the L&amp;DAA open.</p>
      <p>On his return to the canal scene at Liverpool, it was great to see one of Liverpool’s most experienced and popular matchmen revisiting for hopefully targeting his favourite sport, fishing for roach using punched bread.</p>
      <p>Dennis Peterson has a wealth of knowledge on the many canals across the north west and with a history of success within some of the best match outfits in the north, his decision on how to tackle Hall Lane on Sunday needed no questioning when looking at his approach.</p>
      <p>With roach abundant, a punched bread tactic was chosen by Peterson in this one. Choosing to stay on the small stamp of fish he was catching throughout the match, never leaving them and successfully adding them by the minute, Peterson weighed in a winning 9.7.0. Taking second place was Maghull’s Alan Coppull. Again punch tactics saw Coppull on a ‘fish a chuck’ to record 7.14.0.</p>
      <p>Rob Porter took third place with 5.4.0 also consisting of roach on the bread punch.</p>
      <p>On the Wigan Winter League up at Parbold on Sunday, this is a league that is getting more exiting by the week.</p>
      <p>This third round event of six saw Liverpool AS make some ground on the leaders, finishing third on the day with a score of 42. Saints won it with 34 and Wigan Match 36 second. With it all to go for, LAS are in fourth position behind Preston Innovations, Saints and Wigan respectively.</p>
      <p>Over at Carr Mill the third round of the St Helens T&amp;B took place on Sunday seeing 25 teams of two battling it out in tough conditions that saw the fishing difficult everywhere.</p>
      <p>St Helens rod Martin Topping took the individual Honours with 7.14.0. Paul McCarthy took second place with a close 7.6.0.</p>
      <p>McCarthy and his partner Kevin Hall took the day’s pairs honours with a total 12.12.0. Jim Evans and yours truly took second place with 10.13.0.</p>
      <p>Readers may be interested to note that Cadence Fishing UK are holding a North West Open Evening at the MCA (L31 2JH) at Maghull on Tuesday, November 26. Doors open at 7pm-9pm.</p>
