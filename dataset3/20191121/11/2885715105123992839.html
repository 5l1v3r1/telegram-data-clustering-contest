      <p>A Mumbai autorickshaw driver has been turning heads and making headlines, after he turned his three-wheeler into what he claims is the city’s first ‘home system auto-rickshaw’.</p>
      <p>Satyawan Gite’s autorickshaw is equipped with facilities like a washbasin, mobile phone charging points, plants and a television screen among other conveniences.</p>
      <p>A sticker on the back of the vehicle asks passengers to, “Take aeroplane ride experience”.</p>

      <p>“You can charge your phone in my auto, there is purified drinking water, there is washbasin. I also don’t charge senior citizens for rides up to 1 km. The reason I did this is because I wanted to provide better services to passengers,” Gite told <i>ANI</i>.</p>

      <p>The rickshaw has fans, passengers can enjoy music on a Bluetooth speaker, or watch something on a television screen using their mobiles.</p>
      <p>Many were impressed by the facilities being offered, and some said the vehicle qualified to be classified as a “101% 1RK auto” given the cost of buying a home in Mumbai.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, a Pune auto-rickshaw driver was hailed on the internet for giving his vehicle a green makeover, by planting plants and flowers on his vehicle.</p>
      <p>In 2015, another auto-rickshaw driver from Mumbai created a buzz by providing commuters with free wifi and other facilities.</p>
