      <p>The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has described the President Muhammadu Buhari government as corrupt, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that ASUU claimed that the Buhari-government does not obey the laws of the land.</p>
      <p>ASUU’s remark was due to the Federal Government’s directive to its officials to move to campuses to start the enrolment of university workers on the Integrated Personnel Payroll and Information System (IPPIS).</p>
      <p>According to ASUU, University of Ibadan Chairman, Deji Omole, the union would not be intimidated by those who love to break the laws of the land.</p>
      <p>Omole lamented that breaking the country’s laws is the highest form of corruption, describing the failure of the Buhari government to negotiate with ASUU as worrisome.</p>
      <p>“The government’s pronouncement to forcefully enrol university workers is an act of violence against the university system,” Omole noted.</p>
      <p>“It is worrisome for a government under democratic dispensation to resort to force rather than dialogue.</p>
      <p>“If not, why is the government afraid of negotiations. We are not perturbed by the directive. A government claiming to be fighting corruption should not break the law.</p>
      <p>“The university Autonomy Act is very clear on university administrators. There is no greater corruption than those breaking the law of the land.”</p>
      <p>He added that “Breaking of existing laws with impunity is the greatest corruption anywhere in the world; we refused to be harassed or intimidated. We are not strangers in this country.</p>
      <p>“We are veritable stakeholders. We cannot be harassed. We have told them what to do. Let the government come back to negotiation’s table and let’s discuss the grey areas.</p>
      <p>“Forceful enlistment will not solve the problem. We are not disturbed but we are worried, government is getting dictatorial. A supposedly democratic government is getting dictatorial.”</p>
