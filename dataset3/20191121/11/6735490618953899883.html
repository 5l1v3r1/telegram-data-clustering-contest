      <p>Ryan Reynolds finds a hilarious way to plug his Aviation Gin in the middle of an ad for Samsung <i>and</i> his upcoming action film <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/541032/ryan-reynolds-takes-a-wild-tour-of-italy-in-new-6-underground-trailer/">“6 Underground”</a>.</p>
      <p>With Samsung partnering with Netflix to promote watching the Michael Bay-directed film on a bigger, better screen, Reynolds plugs the product before the video rolls to an Aviation Gin ad.</p>
      <p>“How’d that get there?” he sheepishly asks as the commercial director comes on set to ask the Canadian actor what is going on.</p>

      <p>“I bought mid-roll ad placement,” he informs her.</p>
      <p>“You bought an ad for your gin within an ad for your movie within an ad for Samsung TV?” the director asks in the special “director’s cut” of the commercial.</p>
      <p>Reynolds’ “6 Underground” arrives on Netflix on December 13, which the actor would presumably like you to watch at home on a Samsung QLED TV while sipping some Aviation Gin.</p>
