      <p>Tamil film superstar and aspiring politician Rajinikanth, who recently said he was open to working with actor-politician Kamal Haasan “in the interest of Tamil Nadu” on Thursday said if such an eventuality occurred, the Chief Ministerial candidate would be decided based on prevailing circumstances.</p>
      <p>The actor, when asked about aligning with Mr Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam for the 2021 Assembly polls and who among the two will be the Chief Ministerial candidate, said in Chennai: “That has to be decided based on the situation at that time. It has to be decided when we start a party and after discussions with our party members. Till then, I am not ready to discuss this issue.”</p>
      <p>The people of Tamil Nadu will definitely enact a miracle and wonder in the 2021 Assembly elections, he told journalists.</p>
      <p>“The people of Tamil Nadu will 100% percent enact a miracle, a wonder in politics in the 2021 Assembly elections. That is 100% sure,” the actor who returned from the International Film Festival of India, where he was honoured with the Icon of Golden Jubilee award on Wednesday, said at Chennai airport.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said the AIADMK will not be affected by any such alliance between the two actors while Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar said the potential alliance will be ‘decimated’.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, the Makkal Needhi Maiam vice president R. Mahendran, in a release, said Mr Haasan would be admitted to a hospital to undergo a surgical procedure on Friday concerning an implant placed in his right leg in 2016 after he suffered a fall.</p>
      <p>“Due to his very busy schedule in political and film commitments, there had been a postponement in the removal of the implant. However, now upon his doctors’ advice, Dr. Kamal Haasan will be getting admitted in the hospital for the surgical procedure on November 22, 2019 to remove the implant. Furthermore, he has been compelled to take a break for the next few weeks to physically recoup,” he said.</p>
