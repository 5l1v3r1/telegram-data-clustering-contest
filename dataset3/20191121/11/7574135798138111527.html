      <p>Smashing Pumpkins frontman <b>Billy Corgan</b>‘s new album <i><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/william-patrick-billy-corgan-releasing-new-double-lp-cotillions-this-month/">Cotillions</a></i> comes out Friday (11/22), and he wrapped up his <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/billy-corgan-announces-fall-solo-tour/">solo tour</a> previewing it at NYC’s Gramercy Theatre on Wednesday night (11/20). It was his third night in a row at the venue (we caught <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/billy-corgan-began-his-3-night-nyc-run-pics-video-setlist-announced-new-wrestling-series/">night one</a>), and like the previous two nights, his sets included new material, classic Pumpkins cuts, and some covers. One of those covers, <b>Sharon Van Etten</b>‘s “Every Time the Sun Comes Up,” he debuted on the tour’s <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/billy-corgan-covered-sharon-van-etten-played-new-material-at-tour-opener-video-setlist/">first night</a> earlier this month, and he hasn’t played it since until last night. We didn’t have video from night one at the time, but a fan-taken clip of the LA performance has surfaced, and you can watch it below. Interestingly, Billy changes one of the song’s key lines – instead of “I washed your dishes, but I shit in your bathroom,” he sings, “but I <i>spit</i> in your bathroom.”</p>
      <p>As <i><a href="https://www.alternativenation.net/smashing-pumpkins-billy-corgan-threatens-quit-touring/">Alternative Nation</a></i> pointed out, Billy told an Instagram commenter, “after tonight it is doubtful” that he’d do more solo touring after reportedly being heckled by audience members at the Covington, KY stop on his tour over his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=800063933450619">shapeshifter story</a> and 1996 appearance on season seven of <i>The Simpsons</i>. “It’s a problem everywhere,” he wrote, “but U.S. seems to have it worst.” According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashingPumpkins/comments/dziuor/billy_on_broadway/">Reddit user</a>, he addressed the possibility of more solo touring again at night three in NYC, saying that the Gramercy Theatre crowds had made him rethink his no more solo tours moratorium, and had given him another idea: doing a Broadway show. Will that happen? We’ll see.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, The Smashing Pumpkins announced their first 2020 tour date: they’re one of the headliners of Atlanta, GA festival <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/shaky-knees-2020-lineup-pumpkins-strokes-black-keys-yyys-stereolab-jawbox-more/">Shaky Knees</a>.</p>
