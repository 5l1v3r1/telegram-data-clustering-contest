      <h1>Prince Andrew urged to cooperate with US over Epstein</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:40:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:40</time> by <a rel="author">Phil HAZLEWOOD (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew was urged Thursday to speak to lawyers representing victims of paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, after the royal announced he was quitting public life because of the scandal.</p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth II's second son, 59, has faced days of outrage since a television interview in which he defended his friendship with the disgraced US financier.</p>
      <p>Andrew denies claims he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured by Epstein, who was found dead in a New York prison in August while awaiting charges of trafficking minors.</p>
      <p>As a growing number of organisations distanced themselves from the royal and his pet projects, he said he was cancelling public engagements because of the backlash.</p>
      <p>He said he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required".</p>
      <p>US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents five women allegedly assaulted by Epstein, told the BBC that Andrew should speak to everyone probing the allegations -- including her.</p>
      <p>"All of the staff who work for Prince Andrew should come and give information and evidence and the documents should be turned over -- emails, texts, calendars, phone logs, travel logs -- so we can get to the bottom of this," she said.</p>
      <p>Bloom did not rule out approaching the prince directly to secure a sworn statement.</p>
      <p>"We believe that nobody is above the law and that everybody should have to answer questions if they have relevant information -- and he clearly does have relevant information."</p>
      <p>- 'Much worse to come'? -</p>
      <p>Andrew's announcement, which he said was approved by his mother and in which he belatedly expressed sympathy for Epstein's victims, dominated British media for a fifth day.</p>
      <p>Several newspapers said the former Royal Navy officer's reputation was in tatters and speculated about whether he could ever return to formal royal duties.</p>
      <p>Tabloid daily The Sun called the statement "a desperate attempt to fix the appalling failures of his TV interview over the Epstein scandal".</p>
      <p>"But if Andrew thinks this will draw a line under it all, he is delusional. His woes, we fear are just beginning," it added in an editorial.</p>

      <p>The Daily Mail said the claims, which have long cast a shadow over his duties, including as a special government trade representative, could do "serious damage" to the royal family.</p>
      <p>"As it unravels, there may be much worse to come," it added.</p>
      <p>Andrew's decision to step down was taken after "crisis talks" between the monarch herself and her eldest son and heir, Prince Charles, several newspapers reported.</p>
      <p>But as well as potentially having to be quizzed by US investigators, some cast doubt on some of Andrew's claims.</p>
      <p>They include that he had stayed at the residence of Britain's consul-general to New York on one of the three occasions when he had allegedly had sex with his accuser.</p>
      <p>Another is whether he actually met Epstein several years earlier than he claimed.</p>
      <p>- Torrid year -</p>
      <p>The Epstein affair shows no sign of going away, as the BBC is expected to air more revelations from one of his victims in the coming days.</p>
      <p>The scandal tops a torrid year for the royal family marked by strained relations with the media and an apparent lack of direction in terms of control of its public image.</p>
      <p>In October, Andrew's nephew Prince Harry was criticised for giving an interview in which he complained about media coverage of his wife, Meghan.</p>
      <p>He then announced legal action against several tabloids for breach of privacy and phone-hacking, setting up a potentially explosive court confrontation.</p>
      <p>The queen, now 93, described 1992 as her "annus horribilis" after heir to the throne Charles and Andrew separated from their respective wives, and her only daughter, Anne, got divorced.</p>
      <p>Her favourite Windsor Castle residence was also partially destroyed by fire.</p>
      <p>Commentators said the latest scandal could see a repeat and the withdrawal of a senior royal from public life had no precedent since king Edward VIII's abdication in 1936.</p>
