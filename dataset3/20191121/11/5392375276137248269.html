      <p>Realme 5 is making way to Europe, retails for €169<br/>3 (60%) 4 votes</p>
      <p>The Realme 5 which was released back in August this year is finally making its way to Europe. <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Realme">Realme</a> is the fastest-growing company in 2019, and one of the <a href="https://twitter.com/realmeeurope/status/1197462347629113345">major players in India</a>. However, with so many good offerings, there’s no reason to keep smartphones isolated to select markets.</p>
      <p>The Realme 5 Pro is coming in Crystal Purple and Crystal Blue colors options. Worth noting that Realme is offering it only in the 4GB/128GB configuration for €169. Interestingly enough, Realme will be available for €10 less from November 27 to December 2.</p>

      <p>Realme is a solid mid-range handset boasting a Snapdragon 665 chipset. That’s the natural evolution of the good and old Snapdragon 660 with low energy consumption and above than average performance. The handset features a 6.5-inch HD+ display with a waterdrop notch serving as a house for the 13MP selfie snapper.</p>
      <p>Around the back, we can find a quad-camera setup that comprises 12MP main, 8MP ultrawide, 2MP macro and 2MP. The handset has a cool looking diamond pattern and draws power from a massive 5,000mAh battery. The Realme runs ColorOS 6.0 which runs on top of Android 9 Pie. At least one major update for Android 10 should arrive in the form of ColorOS 7.0.</p>
      <p>After releasing their first flagship aka Realme X2 Pro in Europe, the Realme 5 seems like a good offering for the value-for-money range.</p>
