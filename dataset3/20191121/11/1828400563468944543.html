      <h1>Dining out: Beachside Restaurant, The Boulevard Hotel, Blackpool</h1>
      <h2>The construction of new hotels in Blackpool is great to see - and it's not just holidaymakers who are benefitting.</h2>

      <p>Most venues boast a restaurant and the chance to dine in them is not exclusive to staying guests.</p>

      <p>Local residents are also welcome to book a table, which is why we found ourselves at the Beachside Restaurant at The Boulevard Hotel - the latest multi-million pound investment by the Pleasure Beach.</p>
      <p>Our first challenge was finding the entrance, which is tucked away off the Promenade, with the steel tracks of the Big One overhead.</p>
      <p>If first impressions count, this certainly provides the wow factor.</p>
      <p>Money has been spent on creating an impact but comfort has not been sacrificed in the name of style.</p>

      <p>If I was to mark this restaurant on its chairs it would easily get a 10. They were the most relaxing I have ever had the joy of settling into, enfolding you in comfort.</p>
      <p>Another Pleasure Beach restaurant, The White Tower, also has comfy chairs - so it must be their thing!</p>
      <p>While we perused the menu, our drinks order of a bottle of Pinot Grigio was taken and a jug of water brought to the table.</p>
      <p>We also ordered a plate of olives to share.</p>

      <p>The evening a-la-carte menu offers sharing platters or starters ranging from soup to scampi.</p>
      <p>My husband Clive opted for the goats cheese which was presented on a bed of sliced tomatoes and garnish.</p>
      <p>My choice of deep fried salt and pepper calamari was served with a jalapeno, lime and coriander mayonnaise.</p>
      <p>The batter hit the right level of crispiness while the dip supplied enough flavour to complement the squid.</p>
      <p>There is a good selection of mains to choose from, with steaks, lamb chops or spatchcock chicken from the grill.</p>
      <p>While for vegetarians there are risotto, gnocchi and tangine options.</p>
      <p>Clive chose pan fried fillets of seabass which came with Thai stir-fried vegetables and coriander basmati rice.</p>
      <p>This was a more novel way to serve seabass and adding the Thai flavours to the dish added extra piquancy.</p>
      <p>The Boulevard Fish Pie, stacked with smoked haddock, salmon, cod and king prawns also sounded tempting.</p>
      <p>But in the end I was swayed by pan roasted chicken breast accompanied by duck fat potato and braised leeks.</p>
      <p>This was well presented, and the chicken was moist while the potato beneath the crispy skin was delicious.</p>
      <p>We both cleared our plates, but not feeling ready to leave our table (it must have been those chairs!), we decided there was room for dessert.</p>
      <p>While Clive went for the ice-cream, the Eton mess with fresh fruit caught my eye.</p>
      <p>The meringue, it has to be said, was too chewy which was disappointing, but the fruit and cream hit the spot.</p>
      <p>Service throughout was efficient, friendly and informative.</p>
      <p>It is good to see the Pleasure Beach investing in a quality dining experience, while for those wanting a less formal lunch there is a separate day-time menu.</p>
      <p>This includes lighter bites and pizza, so will also appeal to families.</p>
      <p>Our bill, including drinks, came to Â£81.</p>
