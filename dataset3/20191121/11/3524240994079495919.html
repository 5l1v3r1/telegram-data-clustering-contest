        <b>Ademola Babalola, Ibadan</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Oyo State Police Command on Thursday confirmed the killing of a driver attached to the Commissioner of Lands, Housing and Survey in the State, Mr. Abdulraheem Abiodun.</p>
      <p>The police spokesman, Mr. Gbenga Fedeyi told <i>The PUNCH</i> that the fleeing assailants who attacked the commissioner at Academy area of Ibadan, the State capital also shot the police orderly attached to the Commissioner.</p>
      <p>Fadeyi said, “The incident occurred around 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday and the police commissioner has directed that the fleeing armed men be apprehended.</p>
      <p>“They killed the driver and also shot the police orderly attached to the Commissioner for Lands. They will be tracked and arrested to face prosecution,” Fadeyi added.</p>
      <p>A government source said, “The sad development would be thoroughly investigated especially coming 24hours after Governor Seyi Makinde launched 100 vehicles to aid security patrol in the State.”</p>
      <p>An eyewitness also confided to our correspondent that the Commissioner with a team of sympathisers rushed the deceased to the Accident and Emergency Unit of the University College Hospital on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“I saw the Commissioner making calls to the governor, on what happened to him and his aides. The governor ordered the security adviser to immediately proceed to the UCH because it was not quite long after the call, that he (adviser) arrived.</p>
      <p>“The motive behind this attack could not be ascertained “as these armed men after attacking the convoy reportedly took away the gun belonging to the wounded police officer,” he added.</p>
