      </p>
      <p>“People are starting to realise that in return for the sovereignty they so desperately wanted, they’ll have to change their lifestyle,” says one character in Nino Haratischvili’s third and latest novel, The Eighth Life. You could be forgiven for believing this is a dig at Britain’s present moment. In fact, the year is 1991, the country, Georgia, and the scene, the turbulent aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It was a time of civil war: Soviet loyalists and Georgian nationalists were at loggerheads over the direction of the country; uprisings in the Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia were being backed by Russia; the first leader of the newly independent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/georgia-news">Georgia</a> was forced to flee. The rule of law had been all but abandoned: shootings in broad daylight and overnight queues for bread were everyday events.</p>
      <p>When Haratischvili set out to describe the Tbilisi of the 90s that she remembered from her childhood, she quickly discovered that she needed to address everything that had led the country to that point. “I didn’t plan to write such a huge story,” says Haratischvili, who moved to Germany in 2003 and has been living there since. But the resulting 936-page novel, so hefty that her English publishers gave all staff a day off to read it, goes much further back. It chronicles the story of one Georgian family from 1917 to the present day, time-stamped by the Russian Revolution, the second world war and the Prague Spring, and is full of Soviet trappings: white Ladas, <i>Mishka Na Severe</i> chocolates and Red Moscow perfume. Though it is narrated by Niza, a Georgian émigré living in Germany in 2006, it is not autobiographical; Haratischvili describes the novel as personal, an extension of a reality she experienced. The Eighth Life, taking a numerical figure that resembles an infinity sign for its title, is largely about the inescapable patterns of history.</p>

      <p>It is also the 36-year-old author’s first serious engagement in her fiction with Georgia. “Maybe I didn’t want to open the door,” she says, “because somehow I knew that when I opened it once, I would be blown away.” In doing so, Haratischvili’s work represents a literary confrontation with the country’s Soviet past. Having lived in Germany for 16 years, she has seen a nation collectively examining its history, but feels that has yet to happen in Georgia: “When I was taught history at school, I learned for years and years about the medieval ages and David [IV of Georgia] … and only one chapter about the Soviet Union – it was absurd.”</p>
      <p>South of Russia and north of Turkey, and wedged between the Black and Caspian seas, Georgia is the bellybutton of Eurasia, its geopolitical significance meaning that the country has lived under Arab, Persian, Byzantine and then Russian rule, with only a short self-governing period in the middle ages. Under the Soviet Union, the Georgian-born dictator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/joseph-stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> made no allowances for sentimental patriotism; his murderous shadow hangs over the country, though a museum dedicated to him still stands in the town of Gori despite countless efforts to either abolish or rethink the space.</p>
      <p>“I never understood how Georgians could be proud of Stalin,” says Haratischvili. While researching for The Eighth Life, one Georgian told her: “Stalin was a really big man because he forced this huge country Russia to fall down on [its] knees,” words she found shocking, but illuminated a macho, nationalistic thinking that persists in places.</p>

      <p>Stalin and his notorious executioner Lavrentiy Beria, also from Georgia, are left nameless in The Eighth Life, replaced with “Generalissimus” and “Little Big Man”, the latter a playful wink to Beria’s initials. “It felt right to avoid these names,” says Haratischvili. They are not named until the final pages in a joke, a quietly disarming move. “Everything that’s funny loses its power,” she says.</p>
      <p>While Stalin-nostalgia is unshakeable for some, Haratischvili wants to confront the scale of the atrocities that took place under his leadership. “I cannot write about this century and not write about these cruelties,” she says. She does so using the classical literary technique of the curse, here taking the form of a secret hot chocolate recipe passed down through the family that, once drunk, is believed to lead to ruin. In the face of torture, exile, blackmail, surveillance and state killings, it was perhaps easier for victims to blame myth over human agency.</p>
      <p>Haratischvili writes in German, a language that gives her authorial control over a charged subject. “It creates a distance, and I needed distance to be able to describe things,” she says. Only a handful of Georgian writers (Aka Morchiladze, Ana Kordzaia-Samadashvili, and Otar Chiladze among them) have been translated into English. So while there is a noticeable energy surrounding what publishers have called “the Georgian War and Peace”, it’s unusual that it is a German-language book bringing Georgian literature to the English-reading world’s attention.</p>
      <p>Georgia’s future, as pro-EU sentiment, Soviet nostalgia and Georgian nationalism compete for space, is hard to predict. The country faces big economic and social problems, high unemployment and contains a capital city where the need for development is at odds with severe pollution levels. Meanwhile, the disputes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia – “crawling border problems” according to Haratischvili – remain unsolved. The latest chapter in what she describes as Georgia’s “ticking-bomb” relationship with Russia – when a Russian MP chaired a session in the Georgian parliament – saw mass anti-Russia protests in Tbilisi that resulted in police firing rubber bullets and tear gas into crowds.</p>
      <p>Fighting familiar battles for the last 30 years, there’s a sense that Georgia is stuck in its own holding pattern, looking for a way out. Vladimir Nabokov once wrote: “In the spiral form, the circle, uncoiled, unwound, has ceased to be vicious; it has been set free.” The Eighth Life evokes this spirality in its structure, signalled by a blank chapter on the very last page, titled “Brilka” – the name of the youngest family member and the narrator’s listener throughout. “I knew I wanted to end this book with an empty page,” says Haratischvili. “There is hope that maybe [Brilka] is going to make it, is going to write this page in a different way.”</p>
      <p>She believes the “sense of civil society” shown by Georgia’s younger generations means the mentality is changing. Her own, on the other hand, is not so much changing, as crystallising. “The more I live in Germany,” she says, “the more Georgian I become.”</p>
