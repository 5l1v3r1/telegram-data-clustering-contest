      <p>The Duke of York is to continue working on his flagship project Pitch@Palace but will do so without the support of Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Despite saying in a statement that he would “step back from public duties for the foreseeable future”, Andrew is examining ways of continuing the successful mentoring scheme for tech start-ups and entrepreneurs which he founded in 2014.</p>
      <p>It would become a private initiative separate from the public work he has relinquished temporarily amid a backlash following a TV interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>High-profile business sponsors KPMG, Standard Chartered and Inmarsat, a British satellite telecommunications company, have all said they will not renew their financial support for Pitch.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: “He will continue to work on Pitch but will look at how to do that outside and entirely separate from the palace.”</p>
      <p>It is thought the duke will not have any involvement with the dozens of charities, organisations and military units he is associated with as patron or in other roles.</p>
