      <h1>Steve Bruce: I thought I'd have more time at Aston Villa</h1>
      <h2>Steve Bruce believes he should have been given longer at Aston Villa, ahead of his return to B6 with Newcastle on Monday night.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:46:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/luke-hatfield/" target="_blank">Luke Hatfield</a></address>
      <p>The now-Toon boss was sacked by Villa last season before being replaced by Dean Smith, who guided the club to promotion following their historic late run to the play-off final, in which they beat Derby 2-1.</p>
      <p>But Bruce believes he should have got longer at the club to mount a second promotion push after failing in the 2018 play-off final.</p>
      <p>"It's like always when you got back to a club. I had the privilege to manage it." he said.</p>
      <p>"It was a great club. You're always disappointed when it ends. Of course, I thought I would have a bit more time but that was not the case after a difficult period at the club.</p>
      <p>"Financially, it was in a difficult place. We nearly got there - lost in the play-off final - but overall, looking back on it, I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
      <p>"It's a great club with great tradition, great history. I want to go back and beat them - simple as that!"</p>
      <p>Monday will mark the first time Bruce will be back managing at Villa Park since his departure, but he may need to do so without another former Villan on the pitch - with defender Ciaran Clarke a doubt for the encounter after picking up an injury during the international break.</p>
      <p>"Ciaran Clark is our biggest worry after coming on with Ireland. He's got a knock. We'll see how he is."</p>
      <p>Matt Ritchie and Jamaal Lascelles will both miss the game through injury, whilst Bruce has been boosted by news that Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune are available for selection and in contention to start.</p>
