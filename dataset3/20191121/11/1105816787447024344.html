      <h1>China ready to 'fight back' over US Hong Kong bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:06:34+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>BEIJING: </b>China warned on Thursday that it was ready to take measures to “resolutely fight back” after the US Congress approved legislation supporting pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>The Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act passed the House of Representatives by 417 to 1 on Wednesday, one day after the Senate unanimously passed the measure.</p>
      <p>The bill requires the US president to annually review the favourable trade status that Washington grants to Hong Kong, and threatens to revoke it if the semi-autonomous Chinese territory’s freedoms are quashed.</p>
      <p>The White House has not threatened to veto the measure and President Donald Trump is expected to sign it, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
      <p>“We strongly condemn and firmly oppose the passage of relevant Hong Kong-related bills,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang said at a regular press briefing.</p>
      <p>Geng warned the United States against interfering in Hong Kong and China’s internal affairs.</p>
      <p>“If the US side is determined to act alone, China will take effective measures to resolutely fight back,” he said, without giving more details about what action Beijing might take.</p>
