      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/lewis-capaldi-gets-top-celebrate-20920507">Lewis Capaldi's</a> recently released new song was inspired by the heartbreak his family endured after his aunt tragically took her own life.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/lewis-capaldi-nominated-grammy-award-20922436">singer</a> unveiled Before You Go to the world at 5pm on Tuesday evening, telling fans it was his 'most personal track to date'.</p>
      <p>Bathgate native Lewis revealed he was just a young boy when he suffered the devastating loss, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/lewis-capaldis-new-song-tells-20926849">according to The Mirror</a> .</p>
      <p>His lyrics reflect on the "aftermath of people blaming themselves" in the wake of a loved one's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/suicide">suicide</a> .</p>
      <p>Speaking to Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio, the chart-topper told how a chat with his mum about her range of emotions helped him write the song's lyrics.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lewis said: "The song’s kind of, it comes from a place of … it’s about suicide and it’s about not necessarily the act of it itself obviously, but people after it happens, the aftermath of it and people blaming themselves or starting to think, what could I have done to help that person? Or whatever.</p>
      <p>"When I was about five or six I think, my aunt committed suicide and just remember recently speaking to my mum about their feelings, her feelings about going through that sort of rigmarole in your head of, 'What could I have done here? Could I have done anything?' Sort of thing.</p>
      <p>"But she said it was the thing of, at first you’re angry. You’re obviously upset and then you kind of get angry at them, and then you get angry at yourself. She said it was this whole kind of … it’s very, very strange."</p>
      <p>Lewis also told his Instagram followers that it is "one of the most personal songs" he has penned.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He wrote on the social media sight: "Seriously one of the most personal songs I’ve ever written. this song means a lot to me, but it will mean even more if it becomes successful."</p>
      <p>The star accompanied the message with a video of himself listening to the song as he stripped his T-shirt off.</p>
