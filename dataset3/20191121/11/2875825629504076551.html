      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> sister show Extra Camp saw Alison Hammond and Adam Thomas give one of the eating challenges a whirl.</p>
      <p>Both have been in the jungle during previous series, but even life among the creepy crawlies couldn't have prepared them to chow down on the likes of vomit fruit, cow teat and turkey testicles.</p>
      <p>DJs Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts managed to earn a mighty 10 stars when they were forced through the ordeal last night, and the Extra Camp lot thought they'd have a crack at it to prove it ain't so tough.</p>
      <p>Alison struggled to keep it down as she was presented with the vomit fruit during their challenge, Just Desserts, while Adam was left gagging from the fish eyes.</p>

      <p>Last night saw Roman and Adele take on the horrific challenge, with Roman's dad and Spandau Ballet star Martin revelling in the punishing scenes.</p>
      <p>The 58 year old took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to laugh at his lad's misfortunes, writing: "Just voted for my boy to eat Kangaroo B******s...That'll show him!! @romankemp."</p>
      <p>He commented throughout Roman's ordeal, laughing: "...@romankemp how was the penis...what just asking!!!"</p>

      <p>Later he chuckled: "A ranking of best romantic movies: 1) The Notebook 2) Notting Hill 3) Roman and a Bull's Willy."</p>
      <p>Roman's been making waves in camp so far, especially with his impressions of I'm A Celeb hosts and iconic Geordie duo Ant and Dec.</p>
      <p>"Absolutely nothing like us!" Ant cried after the DJ mocked them.</p>
      <p>Twitter disagreed, with one fan writing: "I could quite easily watch an hour of Roman Kemp doing impressions of Ant and Dec each night for the next 3 weeks."</p>
      <p>Another offered: "Funniest bit tonight was Ant and Dec's impression of Roman's impression of them! hilarious."</p>
