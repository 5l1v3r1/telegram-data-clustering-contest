        <b>FBI warns …</b>
      </p>
      <p>FSR also disclosed that the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a warning to banks on a new type of fraud known as the ATM Fraud or ATM Cloned Card fraud.</p>
      <p><b>What it means</b>: It involves hackers accessing bank systems or payment card processors and altering data in order to withdraw large sums of cash within a short period.</p>
      <p>
        <b>High profile victims</b>
      </p>
      <p>By the end-December 2018, various cyber-attacks had been carried out on high profile entities like the Central Bank of Bahamas, Marriot Hotels, Google plus, Arik Air, British Airways and UK NHIS. This led to the loss of customers’ private information, revealing the vulnerability of all classes of organizations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>CBN moves in</b>
      </p>
      <p>To curb the incidence of attacks in the financial system, the apex bank released cybersecurity framework and guidelines for banks and payment service providers.</p>
      <p><b>The framework stipulates</b>, amongst other requirements, the establishment of Cyber-Threat Intelligence (CTI) programmes to proactively identify, assess and mitigate potential cyber-threats and the appointment of a “Chief Information Security Officer” (CISO) to oversee and implement a bank’s cyber-security programme.<br/>In line with good practice, the Bank also appointed a Chief Information Security Officer to oversee its Cyber-security programme.<br/>Operational costs of banks increased at end-December 2018, reflecting increased fuel expenses as well as the 14 per cent hike in electricity tariffs</p>
      <p><b>Back story</b>: Nairametrics had reported that the apex bank had directed financial institutions to resolve customers’ complaints in 72 hours.</p>
      <p><b>Fund Transfer and card related issues</b>: The <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/07/13/cbn-gives-banks-72-hours-ultimatum-to-resolve-customers-complaints/">Central Bank</a>, in a series of tweets educated bank customers on the procedures to lodge their complaints when faced with card-related and fund transfer issues.</p>
      <p><b>Excess charges</b>: Also, CBN informed bank customers to contact the central after a complaint has been tabled to their respective banks on excess bank charges. The tweet reads:</p>
      <p><b>Bank account management</b>: On the case of bank account management, the Central Bank noted that 14 days ultimatum shall apply, after which the customers can contact the apex bank through emails.</p>
      <p><b>Consumer complaint tracking number</b>: Furthermore, the Central Bank accentuated the need for bank account holders to lodge complaints to the apex bank to enable them to do a follow-up. Customer, after lodging complaints, must insist on getting the Consumer Complaint Management System (CCMS) tracking number from the banks.</p>
      <p><b>Why this matters</b>: It means that there is security on the finances of account holders, and the fear of irregular and excess charges from the deposit money banks can be reduced to the barest minimum.</p>
      <p>This move made by the Central Bank has been lauded by many people, who stated that the commercial banks’ regulator is on the road to instilling regularities and transparency in the financial services sector.</p>
