      <h2>Tottenham make big changes after Jose Mourinho is hired to replace Mauricio Pochettino less than 24 hours after his sacking</h2>

      <h3>This weekend’s London derby away at West Ham United will be Jose Mourinho’s first game in charge of Tottenham Hotspur.</h3>
      <p>The former Chelsea FC manager took over from sacked Mauricio Pochettino, who left the north London club after more than five years, without winning a single trophy.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to believe that the north London team is languishing in 14th place in the table after Pochettino guided his team to last year’s Uefa Champions League final before finishing as runners-up to Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Spurs have already lost four times and only recorded three wins in 12 games this term.</p>
      <p>Saying that the Lilywhites have <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/19/tottenhams-crisis-continues-fortunate-draw-home-watford/">endured a crisis</a> since the start of the season doesn’t even begin to tell the full story.</p>
      <p>For a team that is used to winning against the bottom 12 teams, we have witnessed a far from convincing display in the Premier League since February.</p>
      <p>This was the catalyst to the demise of the Pochettino era at Spurs, as his team were a shadow of the side we have become so accustomed to over the past five years.</p>
      <p>No doubt Mourinho could sure use some <a href="https://www.footballbettingtips.com/">free football tips</a> in order to improve his new side’s performances for the remainder of this season. A top-four finish for Mourinho’s new team in the Premier League is a must after they spent £1b on their new stadium.</p>
      <p>The fans have a desire for another decent run in the Uefa Champions League and a possible run in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Constant speculation regarding senior players’ contract extension stalemates has cast a very dark shadow over the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>Indeed, this dark shadow is refusing to go away well into this season barring a couple of Uefa Champions League matches against Red Star Belgrade, with Spurs scoring nine goals without reply.</p>
      <p>However, the uncertainty around players’ futures at the club no doubt played a part in the Spurs squad’s application during Pochettino’s last year in charge.</p>
      <p>For a team that was well-known for its high press and intensive playing style, <a href="https://www.thesportreview.com/topics/tottenham-hotspur/">Spurs</a> now appear to be retracting back with very few counter attacks, as was displayed against Sheffield United in a recent league game.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see how the players will line up for Mourinho, who is renowned for his defensive tactics to get the results desired.</p>
      <p>One can easily argue that Pochettino may have lost the dressing room, or perhaps he lost his passion after over five years at the club. Either way, it seems that this parting of company was the right thing to do for both Spurs and the Argentine coach. Spurs now need to string together a run of victories.</p>
      <h4>Goal Aggregate</h4>
      <p>For this to materialise, a few things must happen first. The back four and goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga must start to keep clean sheets after already conceding 17 goals this season in the Premier League – that’s an average of 1.4 goals per game.</p>
      <p>Added to that, their forwards must score more goals after only managing to net 18 goals so far this season. Chelsea FC have also conceded 17 goals so far but the top-four contenders have scored 28 goals. This tells you that Spurs are a team that is struggling to create goals.</p>
      <h4>Players Out</h4>
      <p>This January, Spurs must try to sell the players that are refusing to extend their contracts at the club, even if it’s for a cut price, these players include: Christian Eriksen, Jan Vertonghen, Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose. Should they refuse to go or not have any suitors, a spell on the bench is needed until they go.</p>
