      <p>Ali wasn’t ready to settle down yet, he decided to continue his battle until he proved her guilty and filed a defamation case against her. In the same attempt, Ali achieved a victory of some sorts already when Meesha’s manager revealed some details about the whole incident to a leading newspaper.</p>
      <p>One of Meesha’s witness – her manager, Syed Farhan Ali revealed to Daily Times that the accusation implied on Zafar were totally false. Syed Farhan Ali denied witnessing any sexual harassment incident from the singer’s side during the jamming session. “I was present in the jamming session held in the house of the plaintiff, Ali Zafar. I didn’t see any act of sexual harassment by the plaintiff as alleged by the defendant,” said Syed.</p>
      <p>Syed also talked about why Meesha went ahead with her false allegations and revealed, “Prior to the shooting of second season show, the management told us that Ali Zafar stood replaced for Atif Aslam. On the same night, Ms Meesha informed me that she would not work with him,” continued Syed Farhan Ali.</p>
      <p>The manager even revealed that Meesha blackmailed Ali Zafar and asked him to withdraw his contract. According to Syed, Meesha even threatened the multination beverage brand Pepsi of dire consequences. For the uninitiated, Ali Zafar had replaced Atif Aslam as one of the co-judges with Fawad Khan and Meesha on Pepsi’s battle of bands show.</p>
      <p>Syed further added, “Meesha not only blackmailed Ali but also the multinational beverage company to extort more money from them and drop Ali Zafar from the recording. However, Ali refused to be threatened or blackmailed so she went ahead with the false allegation.”</p>
      <p>“Now I don’t know what happened between Ali and her, but what I do know is that she has the capability to blackmail and malign one’s reputation. Without hard evidence, I would take everything she says with a ton of salt,” concluded Meesha’s former manager.</p>
      <p>Well, with these shocking revelations, we are sure Meesha doesn’t have any case to fight for. Let us wait and see how the singer reacts to these new revelations.</p>
