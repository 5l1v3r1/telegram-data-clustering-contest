      <p>LONDON: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/British-Airways">British Airways</a> said some flights were delayed on Thursday due to an unspecified technical issue which forced it to cancel some flights a day earlier.</p>
      <p>The airline has suffered three major computer failures since 2017, the latest of which seriously disrupted operations in August.</p>
      <p>"We plan to operate a full flight schedule today. There may be some knock-on delays to flights and we are advising customers to check ba.com for the latest flight information," the airline said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We are sorry for the disruption to customers who have been affected."</p>
      <p>British Airways in July was fined $230 million for a huge customer data breach and in September was hit by its first ever pilot strike.</p>
      <p>Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Brem said that he did not know the details of the latest outage but passengers should not be worried about technical issues at the airline.</p>
      <p>"A lot of airlines have occasional outages. Part of the 6.5 billon pounds investment is going on revamping our IT systems end to end -- commercial systems, operational systems, everything," he told Reuters at an event to launch the Airbus A350 on the London-Tel Aviv route.</p>
      <p>He adding that he was hopeful for progress in resolving a dispute with pilots union BALPA.</p>
      <p>The union, which currently has no industrial action planned, in September held a 48-hour strike which grounded 1,700 flights.</p>
      <p>"I am cautiously optimistic that we will come to an agreement. In a sense, no news is positive news," he said.</p>
      <p>"I hope we will be able to announce in the not to distant future we have come to an agreement."</p>
