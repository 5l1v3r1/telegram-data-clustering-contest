      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:16:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, Pippa Crerar, Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/pippa-crerar/, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn today unveiled Labour's election manifesto by pledging a windfall tax on oil companies.</p>
      <p>The levy would be applied to polluting giants if <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> gets into government as part of a huge shake-up to British politics - even more radical than the 2017 manifesto.</p>
      <p>The last manifesto had already pledged to nationalise mail, rail, water and energy.</p>
      <p>This time Labour's <a href="https://labour.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Real-Change-Labour-Manifesto-2019.pdf">105-page 'Time for real change' dossier</a> pledges nationalised broadband, free NHS prescriptions, free dental checks, free hospital parking and six years' free adult education in England.</p>
      <p>The radical programme would be funded by £82.9billion a year in tax hikes or reforms mainly targeting the richest in society.</p>
      <p>At its heart would be Income Tax hikes on people earning more than £80,000 a year - raising £5.4bn a year by 2023/24.</p>
      <p>A new Income Tax band would hit earnings over £80,000 with a further "super-rich" rate hitting earnings over £125,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Corporation Tax would be hiked from 19% back to 26% after years of Tory cuts - eventually raising £23.7bn a year.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> said the manifesto would bring reforms "the political establishment has blocked for a generation".</p>
      <p>And he said the fully costed document could be funded with no increase in VAT or National Insurance or Income Tax for anyone earning less than £80,000 a year - 95% of earners.</p>
      <p>He told the launch in Birmingham: "Over the next three weeks, they're going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible. That it's too much for you. Because they don't want real change in this country.</p>
      <p>"Why would they? The system is working just fine for them! It's rigged in their favour!"</p>
      <p>The manifesto was unveiled today by Mr Corbyn and his shadow Cabinet in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>It revealed: "We will introduce a windfall tax on oil companies, so that the companies that knowingly damaged our climate will help cover the costs.</p>
      <p>"We will provide a strategy to safeguard the people, jobs and skills that depend on the offshore oil and gas industry."</p>

      <p>The manifesto also pledged to reverse George Osborne's cuts to inheritance tax after they mainly benefited the better-off.</p>
      <p>Today's manifesto said taxes will also be hiked on financial transactions by extending stamp duty reserve duty - raising £8.8bn a year by 2023/24.</p>
      <p>Capital gains tax will also be massively hiked from the current 20% or 28% to the rates of Income Tax - bringing it to 40% or higher for the richest. Labour estimate this move would raise £14bn a year by 2023/24.</p>
      <p>And £5.2bn a year would be raised by reversing inheritance tax and bank levy cuts, forcing private school fees to be subject to VAT, introducing a second homes tax and scrapping the Married Persons Allowance.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said: "We will go after the tax dodgers, the bad bosses, the big polluters, so everyone in this country gets a fair chance in life.</p>
      <p>"That's why they throw everything they've got at us - because they're scared of real change."</p>
      <p>He said the rich "own the Conservative Party" but "they don't own us... the people own the Labour Party".</p>
