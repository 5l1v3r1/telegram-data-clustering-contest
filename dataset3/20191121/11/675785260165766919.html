      <h2>Prince Andrew was seen smiling as he appeared in public for the first time since the Queen forced him to resign amid the fallout of his disastrous BBC Newsnight interview about paedophile Jeffrey Epstein</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:01:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Kitching, Russell Myers, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/russell-myers/</a></address>
      <p>Humiliated <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew</a> has been seen in public for the first time since the Queen effectively sacked him from royal duties.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York, 59, was pictured smiling and waving behind the wheel of his car less than 24 hours after he was summoned to Buckingham Palace and forced to step back from public life.</p>
      <p>It came as the scandal-hit prince faced criticism and calls to co-operate with the FBI after his "car crash" BBC Newsnight interview about his paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein and claims he had sex with a 17-year-old trafficking victim.</p>
      <p>Andrew, wearing a suit and tie, was snapped leaving his home in Windsor on Thursday morning as the fallout from the Royal Family's unprecedented crisis continued.</p>
      <p>American lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims have blasted the Duke over his latest statement and hinted that the Queen's son could be subpoenaed to force him to answer questions under oath.</p>

      <p>Solicitor Lisa Bloom said she had "the right" to seek a statement from individuals she deemed to have "relevant information".</p>
      <p>She told BBC Breakfast: "It's not going to be easy to subpoena someone like Prince Andrew, he's obviously not walking down the street where a process server can just hand him a piece of paper, it's a lot more complicated.</p>
      <p>"If he refused to come, we may have a diplomatic situation between (the UK) and (the US). I hope it doesn't come to that.</p>
      <p>"I take him at his word that he says he is going to co-operate, and I hope that's what's going to happen."</p>
      <p>Asked if an FBI investigation into Epstein could reach to the UK, Ms Bloom said: "It certainly could and it should."</p>

      <p>Her comments come in response to the Duke saying in a statement that he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required".</p>
      <p>Andrew is preparing to give formal evidence to the US criminal investigation into disgraced financier and paedophile Epstein, the Telegraph reported.</p>
      <p>British police have been urged to reopen their investigation into allegations involving Epstein.</p>
      <p>The report emerged along with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-queens-sacking-prince-andrew-20926614">new details about what went on behind the scenes</a> before the Queen's second oldest son was forced to step back from royal life four days after the disastrous BBC interview.</p>
      <p>Following Saturday night's interview, Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's alleged victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the pervert, who killed himself in a New York prison while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Andrew has repeatedly denied claims that he had sex with Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre (nee Roberts) on three occasions when she was a teen.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre, now 36 and living in Australia, claims she was groomed and forced to have sex with Epstein and his friends.</p>
      <p>Andrew claims an alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen, as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>

      <p>The Duke said he had no recollection of meeting Mrs Giuffre.</p>
      <p>Ms Bloom's mother and fellow lawyer Gloria Allred, who also represents alleged victims of Epstein, said Andrew's statement was not clear.</p>
      <p>Ms Allred asked on the BBC's Newsnight programme: "Is he insisting that he be served with a subpoena to testify, or is he willing to speak to law enforcement without being legally required to do so?</p>
      <p>"My clients who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein have spoken to law enforcement without being 'required' to do so."</p>
      <p>She flagged two possible next steps, saying: "One is the criminal justice investigation, to see if charges should be filed in reference to anyone who might have knowingly conspired with Mr Epstein to recruit and to sex traffic underage girls to him."</p>

      <p>The other option was the pursuit of civil lawsuits, like that which she filed on behalf of a woman known as Jane Doe 15, who alleged assault by Epstein when she was aged 15.</p>
      <p>It has emerged that the Queen, 93, summoned Andrew - said to be her favourite son - to Buckingham Palace in central London from his home, the Grade II-listed Royal Lodge, on Wednesday as the scandal deepened.</p>
      <p>She had held crisis talks with future king Prince Charles, 71, who is said to have lobbied for his younger brother to be removed.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Wales, who is on a tour of New Zealand with wife Camilla, reportedly spoke to Andrew by telephone.</p>
      <p>At Buckingham Palace, Andrew issued a grovelling apology to his mum - on her 72nd wedding anniversary with husband Prince Philip - as she forced him to step down.</p>
      <p>The monarch - reported to be "disappointed" and "unhappy" following the BBC interview - then informed the wider Royal Family before the palace issued a bombshell statement on behalf of the scandal-hit prince.</p>

      <p>A source told the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-quits-public-life-prepares-give-evidence-epstein/">Telegraph</a> it was the Queen's decision to force Andrew to step back from public life, adding: "The Duke was summoned from his home, Royal Lodge Windsor, to see the Queen personally at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>"Effectively he was told to bow out gracefully.</p>
      <p>"They agreed he could release a statement saying it was his decision but it was the Queen who told him to do it."</p>
      <p>The Queen is said to have given Andrew approval for the interview before he sat down with journalist Emily Maitlis at Buckingham Palace on November 14.</p>
      <p>Andrew will no longer receive his £249,000 royal allowance which is taxpayers' money from the Sovereign Grant and he has been ditched by a number of companies and charities.</p>
      <p>Andrew has been forced to step back from his more than 200 charity patronages.</p>

      <p>A senior Palace source confirmed to the Mirror that the Duke had vowed to “not return to public life until the Epstein case is closed or he has cleared his name”.</p>
      <p>The palace insider said “that could be a considerable amount of time”.</p>
      <p>The reality means he will have to rely on handouts from his mum from her Duchy of Lancaster money, which made £21million in profits last year.</p>
      <p>Senior palace aides told humiliated Andrew the furore over his Newsnight appearance and shameful excuses for staying at Epstein’s house were damaging the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Before he was forced to step back, the Duke had reportedly planned to fly to Bahrain this Saturday for a Pitch@Palace charity event despite the crisis.</p>
      <p>Andrew will continue working on his Pitch@Palace project, which allows young tech entrepreneurs to compete for backing and funding in front of a live audience, but it will be done privately without the support of Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>A palace spokeswoman said: "He will continue to work on Pitch but will look at how to do that outside and entirely separate from the palace."</p>
      <p>It is reported that Andrew will still be seen with other senior royals on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on big occasions such as Trooping the Colour.</p>
      <p>The future of Andrew’s private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, is also in the balance after reports she helped convince Andrew to do the interview.</p>
      <p>A cloud of uncertainty also now hangs over Andrew’s eldest daughter Beatrice’s wedding next year.</p>
