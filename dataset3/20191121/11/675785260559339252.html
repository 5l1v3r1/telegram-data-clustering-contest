      <p>A selfless doctor saved an elderly passenger's life mid-flight by sucking 800ml urine out of his bladder.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on a China Southern Airlines plane that departed from Guangzhou, southeast China on November 19.</p>
      <p>It was six hours away from the destination, New York, when the pensioner asked for urgent assistance as he was unable to urinate.</p>
      <p>Cabin crew found the elderly man breaking out in a cold sweat so they made an emergency announcement asking for any doctors on board.</p>

      <p>Dr Zhang Hong, who is head of vascular surgery at the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, identified himself and offered to help.</p>
      <p>Hainan People’s Hospital vascular surgeon Xiao Zhangxiang was also present, according to <a href="https://www.chainnews.com/articles/425610264226.htm">China News</a> .</p>
      <p>Dr Zhang assessed the situation and said: "The pensioner's abdomen was bloated, he could not sit still and was sweating a lot.</p>
      <p>"He was going into shock and may have suffered a risk to his life if we didn't tend to him urgently.</p>
      <p>"His family said he had a history of prostate enlargement, so we suspected this was causing urinary retention."</p>

      <p>The pensioner's bladder was at risk of rupturing and urgently needed a solution to pass the urine out of the body.</p>
      <p>The doctors improvised a makeshift catheter using a plastic tube from a portable oxygen cylinder, a syringe from the plane’s first-aid kid, a plastic straw from a milk carton, and some tape.</p>
      <p>With consent from the patient's family, Dr Zhang inserted the device into the bladder but soon discovered that the syringe needle was too thin and could not extract the urine.</p>
      <p>Risking infection, Dr Zhang decided to suck out the patient's urine using his mouth and the tube.</p>

      <p>He repeatedly spit the urine into the empty wine bottle during the life-saving procedure.</p>
      <p>He spent 37 minutes and extracted roughly 800ml of urine from the patient.</p>
      <p>Dr Zhang: "There was no other way. I didn't think too much about it.</p>
      <p>"I only wanted to help him extract the urine retained in his bladder.</p>
      <p>"Saving lives is a doctor's instinct."</p>
