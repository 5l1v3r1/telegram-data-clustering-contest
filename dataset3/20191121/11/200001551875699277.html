      <h1>Tottenham duo could sign new contracts with Spurs after Jose Mourinho’s arrival</h1>

      <p>Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen haven’t signed new contracts at Tottenham Hotspur and the two could leave the club as free agents after this season.</p>
      <p>After being ‘bored’ under Mauricio Pochettino, the Spurs players have an opportunity to get things going again, claims <a href="https://www.hbvl.be/">Het Belang van Limburg.</a></p>
      <p>The Belgian newspaper believes Jose Mourinho’s arrival in north London could mean the Belgium duo sign new contracts.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed Mourinho’s arrival will have a ‘liberating effect’ on the two defenders.</p>
      <p>At 30, Alderweireld will have more options next summer if he decides to leave, but its unlikely be the case with his compatriot Vertonghen, who will turn 33 in April. Therefore, the latter could listen to possibly extending his stay with Spurs.</p>

      <p>There are no sporting objections for Alderweireld and Vertonghen with Mourinho’s preferred style of football and the report also mentions the manager tried to sign the former when at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>It’s a contrast to what they’re saying in Denmark about Christian Eriksen, with it being thought there that Mourinho’s arrival makes an exit likelier.</p>
