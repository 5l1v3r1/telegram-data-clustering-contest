        <b>Engineers Without Borders UK has launched the 2020 cycle of the Engineering for People design challenge, in partnership with the organisation’s South Africa and USA chapters.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The competition calls on first and second-year university students to consider the social, economic and environmental impact of their engineering and tasks them to propose a solution that could be applied to a “real-life problem affecting people on a global scale”.</p>

      <p>Over nine years, the challenge has reached over 34,500 undergraduate students to date. Its 2020 instalment has been extended to more than 7,000 students over three continents. EWB notes there is still time remaining for more students to get involved.</p>
      <p>The 2020 challenge focuses on Makers Valley, a suburb of Johannesburg, South Africa. As a result of rapid population growth and economic inequality, the area is facing housing shortages, inconsistent access to electricity and water and problems with waste collection.</p>
      <p>Students taking part in the challenge will design a potential solution that addresses one of the region’s key issues and is an appropriate fit for the economic, environmental and social context of the community.</p>
      <p>Academics from each institution will review their students’ submissions with the top five from each university advancing to be judged by industry volunteers.</p>
      <p>The best team from each participating university will be invited to present their solutions at a grand finals event in London for the chance at the grand prize: a £2,000 educational bursary. The runner-up and the people’s prize winners will also receive £500 each.</p>
      <p>Emma Crichton, head of engineering at Engineers Without Borders UK, said: “We are thrilled that our award-winning Engineering for People design challenge is reaching a wider audience with students participating from South Africa, UK, Ireland, UAE and the USA.”</p>
