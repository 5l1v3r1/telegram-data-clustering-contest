      <p>Alex Salmond denies trying to rape a woman at the official residence of the first minister of Scotland during the independence referendum campaign.</p>
      <p>The former first minister, 64, is said to have kissed and groped the woman at Bute House during the historic vote in 2014.</p>
      <p>He is then alleged to have pinned her against a wall before pulling at her clothes, stripping his own off and attempting to rape her on a bed.</p>
      <p>Salmond appeared at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/high-court/">High Court</a> in Edinburgh on Thursday where he denied 14 offences against 10 women.</p>
      <p>They include a charge of attempted rape, 11 of sexual assault – including one with intent to rape – and two of indecent assault dating between 2008 and 2014, with one assault said to have taken place in the month of the referendum.</p>

      <p>Both incidents were said to have taken place between the date of the Edinburgh Agreement in 2012 and the day of the independence vote in September 2014.</p>
      <p>The first of the charges involved incidents where Salmond is said to have indecently assaulted a woman by kissing her mouth and groping her on various occasions around Glasgow in the summer of 2008.</p>
      <p>He is also accused of sexually assaulted a woman on various occasions between 2011 and 2013 at the Scottish Parliament, Bute House and other locations by touching her bottom and stroking other parts of her body.</p>
      <p>Several charges involved the accused allegedly groping women, including one incident at the Ubiquitous Chip restaurant in Glasgow in the spring of 2012.</p>
      <p>Salmond – who was Scotland’s first minister from 2007 to 2014 – is also said to have taken off a woman’s shoe and trying to kiss her foot in late 2013.</p>
      <p>He is also accused of grabbing a woman by her shoulders at Bute House in 2014, repeatedly kissing her face, trying to kiss her lips and touching her leg.</p>
      <p>Gordon Jackson QC, representing Salmond, said he denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>Judge Lady Dorrian continued the preliminary hearing until January 22 and set a trial date for March 9, which is expected to last four weeks.</p>
      <p>Speaking outside court after the hearing, Mr Salmond said he would defend himself ‘vigorously’ during the trial.</p>

      <p>‘The only proper place to answer criminal charges is in this court and that is exactly what I intend to do next spring,’ he said.</p>
