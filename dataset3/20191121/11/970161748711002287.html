      <p>If you’re looking for a cheap <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/xbox-one/">Xbox One</a> during Black Friday 2019 you’re not going to get a much better deal than at Lidl.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> is still more than a week away but you’re going to be lucky if there’s a better bargain then the Xbox One S All-Digital Edition for just £129.</p>
      <p>For that you get the Xbox One S, which is the base model of the Xbox One that doesn’t have a disc drive, and three games: Minecraft, Sea Of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 3.</p>
      <p>It’s basically the same deal as Microsoft officially revealed for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/pre-black-friday-xbox-one-s-deal-200-three-games-11043758/">£199.99 a few weeks ago</a>, which was considered a pretty good price on its own.</p>

      <p>The downside is that this doesn’t look like being an online offer and so you’ll actually have to go in-store on Friday, 29 November to pick one up, which will likely be… busy.</p>

      <p>A deal like that is likely to run out fast, so if you’ve got a store nearby that stocks consoles you might want to bear that in mind.</p>
      <p>Because there’s no disc drive that means all the games have to be digital downloads, although with <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass Ultimate</a> available now for just £1 that’s not much of a hardship.</p>
      <p>The standard Xbox offer gives you three months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for just £1, which includes over 100 games now and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/xbox-game-pass-gets-50-new-games-including-witcher-3-final-fantasy-11148170/">50 more over the next few months</a> – including big name titles such as The Witcher 3 and a whole raft of Final Fantasy games.</p>
