      <p>Pan-Africanism can contribute to successful initialization of zero emission technology in Nigeria, a Nigerian-American serial entrepreneur, Adetola Anifalaje, has said.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a chat with The Nation, Anifalaje said, Pan-Africanism advocates for self-reliance of Africans and strengthens the bond between indigenous and diaspora groups to discuss issues on furthering technology in Nigeria or other African nations.</p>
      <p>She explained that Pan-Africanism can be successful through the combined knowledge and expertise of professionals in Africa and in diaspora in the field.</p>
      <p>“Their coming together would help introduce a significant approach to targeting corporate consumer in a niche industry. This would provide zero-emission advanced solutions with intricate knowledge from the design, development, and deployment of the most effective and advanced energy solutions The energy solutions includes battery packs or power walls for numerous applications including portable nuclear power supplies.”</p>

      <p>According to her, batteries have endless applications in space, military, defense, and automotive industry, noting that it can be used to invent machinery to aid in the development.</p>
      <p>She said Nigerians need to re-prioritize and reevaluate what is needed to promote change, lamenting that the economy currently depends on petroleum which is going to go extinct soon.</p>
      <p>She added that for Nigeria to get out of her current plight of economic crisis, there must be a proposed solution, deals must be secured with developed nations and the agricultural sector must be fully tapped into.</p>
      <p>She urged youths to understudy developing countries with the view to develop the economy.</p>
      <p>“Sustainable energy would thrive through a stem summit that would create an opportunity for networking, education, and mentorship from experts both in Africa and diaspora in the field,” she added.</p>
