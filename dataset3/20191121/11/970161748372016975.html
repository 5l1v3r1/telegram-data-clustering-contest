      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> seemed more than a little concerned on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> as she was informed that the world’s smartest robot could turn evil.</p>
      <p>Holly and Phil were joined by Sophia, the self-styled world’s smartest robot, on the show and it certainly made for a very interesting interview.</p>
      <p>Sophia was sat with one of her co-creators, scientist David Hanson, but it seemed that Holly only had one question on her mind.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> had joked before the interview that the robot could end up ‘replacing’ the duo in a few years.</p>

      <p>This seemed to have Holly rattled, and she seemed to stare at the robot almost in disbelief. Could she be looking at her This Morning replacement in a few years?</p>
      <p>She put the question to Hanson if Sophia, theoretically, could turn against the humans and go rogue. The answer probably wasn’t what she was hoping to hear.</p>
      <p>‘Could she…turn on us?’ Holly asked the scientist, grimacing and definitely trying not to make contact with her possible future robot overlord.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t think so,’ Hanson replied before Holly shot the camera a very worrying look.</p>
      <p>‘You don’t <i>think</i> so?’ she said. Safe to say by the look on her face, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dancing-on-ice/">Dancing on Ice</a> presenter did not look convinced.</p>
      <p>To prove her intellectual prowess even further, however, the AI machine presented the morning TV duo with their very own portraits – drawn by the robot herself.</p>
      <p>A robot that can draw? That’s not creepy at all. She knows what you look like now Holly – run while you still can!</p>
