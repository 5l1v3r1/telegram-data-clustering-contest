      <h1>This code unlocks a stunning Black Friday deal on Surfshark VPN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:09:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/joseph-green/" target="_blank">Joseph Green</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Surfshark VPN is on sale for £1.41 a month with the code <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b4u6">surfsharkdeal</a>, saving you 85% on list price.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In the never-ending quest for the very best deals, sometimes all it takes is a code. This humble collection of letters can unlock all manner of discounts and offers.</p>
      <p>With a little help from the code <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b4u6">surfsharkdeal</a>, you can now subscribe to Surfshark VPN for as little as <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b4u6">£1.41 a month</a>. This two-year plan also includes an extra three months for free, meaning you're protected for 27 months in total. </p>
      <p>This impressive deal is discounted by 85% on list price, and by the end of the contract you end up saving over £200. It's also fully refundable for 30 days, which covers you in case you don't like the service or you find a better deal elsewhere. We think that's unlikely, though.</p>
      <p>Surfshark VPN allows you to connect an unlimited number of devices to the service, with fast content delivery. It also boasts strong levels of security and privacy, and has a no logs policy to protect your data. If you have any questions, you can always fall back on the around the clock customer support. It's a comprehensive service that should appeal to anyone with an online presence.</p>
      <p>There are already plenty of <a href="https://mashable.com/uk/shopping/best-black-friday-cyber-monday-vpn-deals-uk">Black Friday</a> deals on VPNs, but we reckon this might be the best of the bunch.</p>
