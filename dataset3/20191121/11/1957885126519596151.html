      <h1>Pokémon Go's December Community Day recap weekend detailed</h1>
      <h2>Got a brand new Bagon.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:01</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Pokémon Go is bringing back all of its 2019 Community Day creatures for a recap weekend on 14th and 15th December.</p>
      <p>The game did this last year, too - it's a smart way to catch up on any you missed.</p>
      <p>All <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-21-pokemon-go-community-day-time-list-moves-6002">Community Day exclusive moves</a> previously offered when evolving will once again be available, including all 2018 Community Day moves.</p>
      <p>So, if you have a Larvitar, Beldum or Bagon sitting ready to evolve - now is the time. Each will get meta-defining attacks when you evolve them up over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The Community Day weekend will run from 9am to 9pm on both Saturday 14th and Sunday 15th December. During that time, all 2019 Community Day Pokémon will appear more frequently in the wild.</p>
      <p>This means: Totodile, Swinub, Treecko, Torchic, Mudkip, Ralts, Slakoth, Trapinch, Bagon, Turtwig, and Chimchar.</p>
      <p>All past Community Day exclusive moves will be available while evolving during this 12-hour window, and a range of past Community Day Pokémon will appear in raids and eggs.</p>

      <p>Within that 12-hour window, a normal Community Day three-hour window will <i>also </i>run on each day. This will offer <i>even greater</i> spawns of specific species. If you're after a specific Shiny for your collection, this will likely be the optimum window in which to hunt.</p>
      <p>Saturday 14th December between 11am and 2pm will be the best time to find Totodile, Swinub, Treecko, Torchic, Slakoth, and Bagon.</p>
      <p>Sunday 15th December between 11am and 2pm will be the best time to find Mudkip, Ralts, Trapinch, Turtwig, and Chimchar.</p>
      <p>Both 11am-2pm windows will also grant you double Catch Stardust and XP plus half egg hatch distance.</p>
      <p>Now, how soon in 2020 do we get a Gible Community Day?</p>
