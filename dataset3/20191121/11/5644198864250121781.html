      <p>LONDON: Players in the top two divisions of Dutch football will standstill for the first minute of matches this weekend as a protest against racism, the top flight Eredivisie has said.</p>
      <p>An anti-racism message will be also displayed on scoreboards during the opening minute at Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie games and an extra minute will be added to first-half injury time.</p>

      <p>The move comes after Excelsior forward Ahmad Mendes Moreira was racially abused by a section of FC Den Bosch supporters last weekend, with the game suspended for half an hour after the referee decided to take the players off the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Dutch football association has said it would investigate the incident and look into possible sanctions against Den Bosch and its supporters.</p>
      <p>A series of racist incidents has tainted European football recently.</p>
