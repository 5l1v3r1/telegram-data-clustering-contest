      <h2>Liverpool face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in the Premier League on Saturday as they begin a run of 12 games in 40 days across four different competitions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:46:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:46</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Sadio Mane has total belief in Jurgen Klopp as the German gets set to guide Liverpool through their most chaotic period of his stewardship.</p>
      <p>The Reds return to action in their Premier League clash at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday, with that match kicking off a relentless period of 12 matches in 40 days across four different competitions.</p>
      <p>That run includes the playing of two games in two days as Liverpool plot to split their squad for the Carabao Cup quarter-final at Aston Villa on December 17 and the Club World Cup semi-final in Qatar the following day.</p>
      <p>Even after the run ends with a Premier League game at home to Sheffield United on January 2, Liverpool will face an FA Cup third round tie before huge league contests against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>

      <p>But having pulled eight points clear at the top of the table with a 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> before the international break, Mane firmly believes that Klopp is the man to guide the Reds during the tough schedule.</p>
      <p>“I would struggle to describe just how successful he has been for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ," the Senegalese star told the Official Liverpool Monthly Magazine.</p>
      <p>“Everybody can see what he has done for this club, for this city and the quality he has as a manager.</p>

      <p>“There are a lot of good managers in Europe but what I can say is that our manager always has the right words and the right things to manage his team, especially knowing how to deal with his team.</p>
      <p>“I would always trust his influence on the team. He is a winner and I would say he is the best in the world.”</p>
      <p>Mane is set to feature at Selhurst Park on Saturday having come through two internataional matches unscathed, but there are doubts over the fitness of both Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson.</p>
