      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield has sold over 6m units globally in its first week, becoming the fastest-selling Switch game ever.</p>
      <p>This figure includes both digital and physical sales, <a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/corporate/PostImages/b1b2b7b4ea55eef149f2bc849c194eea958c68c6.pdf">The Pokémon Company has announced</a>, doubling that of Pokémon Let's Go's last year which sold 3m in its first week.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-18-pokemon-sword-is-the-biggest-single-format-release-this-year">Pokémon has already been dominating the UK game charts this week</a>, with Sword taking up the top spot, Shield in third, and the Dual Edition coming up in seventh.</p>
      <p>While Sword and Shield may be the fastest-selling Switch title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-11-28-pokemon-sun-and-moon-are-nintendos-biggest-uk-launch">the record for fastest-selling Pokémon game still belongs to Sun and Moon</a>, which reportedly sold 7.2m in its first week.</p>
      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield is available on Switch right now, and if you're still put off by the whole #Dexit thing, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-18-modders-are-already-adding-cut-pokemon-into-sword-and-shield">there are already modders on the case trying to port the missing 'mons into the games</a>.</p>
