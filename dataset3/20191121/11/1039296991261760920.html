      <h1>Next-gen Hyundai Tucson previewed as Vision T Concept</h1>

      <p>The Hyundai Vision T SUV features a plug-in hybrid drivetrain; unveiled at Los Angeles Auto Show 2019.</p>
      <p>Hyundai has showcased a futuristic SUV concept called the Vision T at the ongoing Los Angeles Auto Show 2019. This new concept actually previews the next-gen Tucson SUV that is expected to make its world debut later next year. </p>
      <p>The Hyundai Vision T Plug-in Hybrid previews an ‘eco-focused’ SUV designed for dynamic driving, according to Hyundai. The machine is the seventh in a series of concept cars developed by Hyundai’s Design Centre to showcase its ‘Sensuous Sportiness’ design language. Hyundai said the Vision T is intended to “be on the cutting edge of the most dynamic SUV designs”.</p>
      <p>The Vision T SUV concept features a bold grille, with LED headlights are incorporated on the sides, a stretched bonnet and a coupe-style roofline. Measuring 4,610mm long, Hyundai says the SUV concept has a long wheelbase - 2,804mm - and short overhangs to maximise its dynamic character.</p>
      <p>The grille features a Parametric Air Shutter concept, which means that it is closed and static when the Vision T is stationary. Once the SUV is in motion, individual grille cells move in a set sequence, which Hyundai says adds to the machine's “dynamic character”, while also controlling airflow to the hybrid powertrain to optimise aerodynamics and fuel efficiency. It also features a glass roof with a pattern embossed into it, along with a dark chrome Hyundai badge that glows green and red when illuminated.</p>
      <p>Hyundai has not given any details of the Vision T’s plug-in hybrid powertrain. The charging port is located on the rear quarter panel, and a blue light illuminates when it is charging. A circular light cluster shows the charge level of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>While this new concept will preview the next-gen Tucson, India is yet to get the <a href="https://www.autocarindia.com/cars/hyundai/tucson-facelift"><b>mid-cycle update for the current-gen Tucson</b></a> that went on sale globally long ago.
