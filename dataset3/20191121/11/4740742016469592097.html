      <h1>Bristol Rovers fans speculate over takeover bid as chairman departs club</h1>
      <h2>He has left after three and a half years at the Gas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:12:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:12</time> by <a rel="author">David Byrom</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Rovers fans have been reacting to the news that chairman Steve Hamer has left the club.</p>
      <p>Hamer had been at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">the Gas</a> since the al-Qadi family took charge of the club in February 2016, but has now departed <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-rovers-chairman-steve-hamer-3561377">the club following a brief statement on their website.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/exclusive-former-arsenal-england-star-3409789">With plenty of talk over a potential takeover</a> at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers</a> , it has fuelled fan speculation that something could well be in the offing - although it is fair to say there is no love lost from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Gas</a> supporters towardsÂ  the departing Hamer.</p>

      <p><b>Holmz:</b> Oh no! Who will be doing all the non-executive chairman type stuff now?!</p>
      <p><b>Chris Walden:</b> Didn't realise he was even at the club anymore.</p>
      <p><b>Mark Connell:</b> To be honest I thought he had already gone. Is this the sign of the new takeover?</p>
      <p><b>Harley Hatcher:</b> Forgot about this bloke.</p>
      <p><b>Simon:</b> Forgot he even existed to be honest.</p>
      <p><b>Patrick Temple:</b> Good riddance.</p>
      <p><b>Wendi Williams:</b> Another statement without any explanation. The rubbish communication from the club to the fans continues.</p>
      <p><b>Matty White:</b> Good. What was his role anyway?</p>
      <p><b>Paul Edwards:</b> Clearing the decks for a new owner?</p>
      <p><b>Dawn Talbot:</b> Oh no! I liked Mr Hamer.</p>
