      <h1>Mo Salah posts indoor training pic ahead of Crystal Palace game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:47:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>Mo Salah looks unlikely to face Crystal Palace on Saturday, considering he’s still not training outside with his Liverpool team-mates.</p>
      <p>The Egyptian posted a picture of his indoor gym work last night, and while it’s great to see him out of his protective boot, it looks like we’ll have to do without him at Selhurst Park – sadly.</p>
      <p>He has an ankle problem which was originally picked up v Leicester and then exaggerated in the victory over Manchester City – despite our no.11 staying on the field and putting in a superb performance.</p>
      <p>Salah didn’t play for Egypt during the international break and has been at Melwood doing his rehab in order to get fit ahead of the manic run of fixtures we have before the New Year.</p>
      <blockquote>⚽️ <a href="https://t.co/lnp0Xzg2OY">pic.twitter.com/lnp0Xzg2OY<br/></a>— Mohamed Salah (@MoSalah) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoSalah/status/1197241571327930368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2019</a></blockquote>
      <p>We’ve won every game this season in the Premier League that Salah has started in – although failed to beat Manchester United when he was absent with an injury.</p>
      <p>Without him, Jurgen Klopp will have to decide between Divock Origi as a wide-forward, or potentially Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain on the left.</p>
      <p>The Englishman has traditionally done quite poorly in this role for us – but he’s in such good form it’s maybe worth a shout.</p>
