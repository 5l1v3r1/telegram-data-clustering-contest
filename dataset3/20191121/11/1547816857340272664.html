Post his elimination, the actor confessed that he loves Rashami and would want to re-enter the show just to propose her for marriage. So do you think he should be brought back on the show?</b>

      <p>When<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-rashami-desai-s-rumoured-boyfriend-arhaan-khan-marks-his-grand-entry-on-salman-khan-s-show/5dbc3fb187fb571eff7e34b1"> Arhaan Khan was entering Bigg Boss 13 as wild card</a>, tongues were wagging that the actor is entering the show for his rumoured girlfriend Rashami Desai. However, in an <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/tv-interviews/bigg-boss-13-wild-card-arhaan-khan-i-will-confront-arti-singh-for-wrongly-accusing-rashami-desai-of-spreading-sidharth-shukla-and-her-link-up-rumours-exclusive/5dbd243887fb571eff7e34d8">exclusive chat with SpotboyE.com, Arhaan had vehemently denied the same</a> stating that he’s doing the show only for his mother.<br/><br/>Even when inside the house, he didn’t try to get too close to Rashami, when in fact, the <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-rashami-desai-confesses-she-likes-arhaan-khan-reveals-she-is-planning-settle-in-matrimony-next-year/5dce3c4887fb571eff7e3e4e">actress confessed to Paras Chhabra in one of the episodes that she liked Arhaan</a> and wishes to settle down with him next year.</p>

      <p>Before their equation could grow stronger in the house, Arhaan was evicted due to less votes. His elimination left Rashami teary-eyed and one could see the connection.<br/><br/>The actor who stayed mum all this while, finally confessed in a Bombay Times interview post his exit, that <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-evicted-contestant-arhaan-khan-on-rashami-desai-i-am-in-love-want-to-go-inside-to-propose-to-her/5dd2433687fb571eff7e4004">he is in love with Rashami and wishes to go back</a> to the house only so that he could propose her for marriage.<br/><br/>So that brings us to our question- Do you think Bigg Boss makers should indeed listen and bring him back on the show?
