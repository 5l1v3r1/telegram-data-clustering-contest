      <p>Rumours of lucrative rematches with Manny Pacquiao and Saul “Canelo” Alvarez have been rife, raising fans’ hopes of a comeback for the 12-time world champion. But Mayweather, who last fought in 2017 when he beat MMA star Conor McGregor, said: “I’ve got calls to get back into the ring, but my health is my wealth.</p>
      <p>“Boxing is a very, very brutal sport. In the last few years a lot of fighters have died inside that squared circle. You have got to know when to hang it up. I had a great career.”</p>
      <p>Mayweather has retired twice in the past, first in 2007 and then again in 2015, but returned to the ring on both occasions. However, the 42-year-old says his only future fights will be exhibitions, like the one in January which saw him demolish Japanese kickboxer Tenshin Nasukawa in less than three minutes.</p>

      <p>“I’ll still travel and do exhibitions,” said Mayweather. “I make great money doing exhibitions – between $10 and $30million.</p>
      <p>“I think I make more doing that than most fighters make fighting.”</p>
      <p>Mayweather, who takes an unblemished 50-0 record into retirement, says he is keen to focus on other projects, such as his chain of boxing gyms and his promotion company. — <b>Sky Sports.</b></p>
