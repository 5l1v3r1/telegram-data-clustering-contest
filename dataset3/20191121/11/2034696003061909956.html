      <p>Bernie Sanders has surprised <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> by turning up to watch one of her concerts.</p>
      <p>Ahead of a Democratic debate that Sanders was attending in Atlanta yesterday (November 20), the Senator attended Grande’s concert at the State Farm Arena.</p>
      <p>Later, Grande shared some images capturing the moment on Twitter, along with a note showing her support for the 78-year-old politician.</p>
      <p>“MY GUY,” Grande wrote, adding: “Thank you Senator Sanders for coming to my show, making my whole night and for all that you stand for!” Grande revealed in the post that over 20K young people had already registered to vote at her shows.</p>
      <p>She continued: “also I will never smile this hard again promise.” You can see the post below:</p>
