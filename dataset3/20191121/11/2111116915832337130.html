      </ul>
      <p>It’s been an interesting year for even the best Apple Watch apps. In the spring it seemed as if the Watch had lost its sparkle, with many big-name apps either languishing or being pulled from the Watch altogether. The problem wasn’t that Apple Watch apps are a bad idea, though. </p>
      <p>Far from it, as our selection here demonstrates. It was that sometimes, apps were designed to answer the wrong question: “could we make a Watch app?” but not “should we?”</p>
      <p>Now, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/watchos-6-release-date">watchOS 6</a> is set to bring an App Store to your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/which-apple-watch-should-i-buy">Apple Watch</a> for the very first time. That may encourage app developers to take the Apple Watch more seriously, so 2019 may be a big year for great new apps on your wrist.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-watch-4-review"><u>Apple Watch 4</u></a> is proving pretty popular too, and that's why you're probably here checking out the new apps. In fact, it's one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/best-smart-watches-what-s-the-best-wearable-tech-for-you-1154074">best smartwatch</a> options out there, though it has been overtaken by the new <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apple-watch-5-review">Apple Watch 5</a>.</p>

      <p>Our favorite apps, the apps that are still here after a bumpy year, both should and could have been made. They exist because they’re useful, or because they’re entertaining, or because they make your life that little bit better. </p>
      <p>In this round-up you’ll find apps for podcasting and procrastinating, for getting fit and getting stuff done, for messing around and for sorting stuff out. </p>
      <p>Before you get into our list remember to head into the Apple Watch main app on your iPhone - that's where you'll see a list of the apps already installed on your phone that can also be transferred to your Watch. If you see any you like the look of here, you'll need to download them to your iPhone first.</p>
      <p>And make sure to check this article weekly, as we'll add a new app each week, highlighted below.</p>
      <h4>Apple Watch app of the week: Productive – Habit Tracker</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCyzLmqoqxgHKvza4N6SiV.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: Apalon Apps)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Productive – Habit Tracker</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free (in-app purchases)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Productive is an alternative to the popular Streaks app, and like Streaks it’s designed to help you get things done by establishing regular habits.</p>
      <p>Those habits might be to make time for reading or to keep yourself hydrated, to do your morning workout or to strike items off your to-do list. The app enables you to create and track chains of habits, so for example you might want to remind yourself to drink water 8 times a day or meditate 3 times a week.</p>
      <p>Where many apps like this are designed with workplace productivity in mind – and Productive can handle that stuff just fine – the emphasis here is more on your whole life: the marketing images prefer to show tasks such as reading a good book and going out for a nice meal rather than hard-charging corporate ladder-climbing.</p>
      <p>The app has been designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, and that extends to the Apple Watch companion too. The Watch app enables you to see what tasks you want to achieve today, reminds you when it’s time to do them, and enables you to either mark a task complete or skip that particular instance.</p>
      <p>The data then goes back to the iPhone app, which pulls the stats together to let you see how well you’re doing and compare your achievements to your intentions.</p>
      <h4>Best Apple Watch apps for fitness and running</h4>
      <p>There's no denying that the main thrust of the Apple Watch since the second model is for fitness: it's packing GPS, heart rate, water resistance and improved sensors to make the most of the fact people like to work out with this thing - it even connects to gym equipment.</p>
      <p>This list of Apple Watch fitness, running, wellbeing and health apps are nearly all must-have - if you're going to do one thing with your new Watch, use it to become a healthier you in mind and body.</p>
      <h4>Hole19 Golf GPS &amp; Scoring</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8eCi8vnzD2MoDCuyVxeq3B.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: Stat Track Technologies Lda.)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Hole19 Golf GPS &amp; Scoring</li>
        <li>Free (in-app purchases)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Hole19 claims to be the most-used golf GPS range finder in the UK, with more than 10 million rounds registered, and it claims to be as accurate as a real caddie – although it doesn’t specify which one.</p>
      <p>As is usually the case with sports apps the bulk of the work is done by the iPhone app, with the Apple Watch companion providing just the essential features and information you need while you’re on the green.</p>
      <p>The main app offers two key tools: GPS range finding so you can see how far you are from your goal as well as any hazards, and a digital scorecard that you can use to track your stats over time.</p>
      <p>On your watch, it shows you the distance to the front, center and back of the green; swipe and there’s an input screen where you can track your performance. It’s all very simple and straightforward, enabling you to track your playing without distracting you for too long.</p>
      <p>The usefulness of the app depends mainly on whether it knows about the course(s) you want to play. Hole19 knows over 42,000 courses in 201 countries, so yours should be covered, but the app’s free to try so you can make sure it’s right for you before signing up for a subscription.</p>
      <h4>Gymatic Workout Tracker</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ijwjJBtAM5wioR7AyLZwCX.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: Vimo Labs Inc.)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Gymatic Workout Tracker</li>
        <li>Free (in-app purchases)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>How’s this for a sales pitch: Gymatic delivers “data and insights not visible to human eyes”. How do you read it, then? Bad marketing copy aside, the app is a powerful and comprehensive workout tracker that can automatically log your workouts and count your reps.</p>
      <p>The app also promises more accurate calorie tracking than its rivals because it can identify exactly what kind of exercise you’re doing and calculate your calorie usage accordingly.</p>
      <p>Gymatic has been designed and tested with a wide range of exercise regimes including but not limited to CrossFit, bodybuilding and weightlifting, HIIT workouts, kettlebell training, calisthenics and machine exercises, and it also automatically tracks running, cycling, rowing and stair climbers.</p>
      <p>It’s extremely comprehensive. The Apple Watch app provides key stats when you’re running or guidance when you’re doing barbell squats; if you’re doing the latter you’ll see your rep counter, the barbell weight, your current heart rate, and how many sets you need to do. There’s even a little image showing how to do it.</p>
      <p>As with almost all fitness apps, the free version is really just a taster: for the full range of features and tracking you’ll need to take out a Premium subscription, which is currently $49.99 / £48.99 / AU$79.99.</p>
      <h4>RocketBody</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CTjCbaSfs2wCJKNfoi32yZ.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: RocketBody, Inc.)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>RocketBody</li>
        <li>Free/IAPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Designed for people who take their fitness seriously, RocketBody doesn’t just record what you do. It also predicts your recovery, enabling you to make plans to maximize the effectiveness of future workouts or sports sessions. That’s because of its intelligent algorithms, which combine ECG monitoring (from your Watch, if it’s a Series 4 or better) with other inputs such as your calorie expenditure during workouts and your food intake.</p>
      <p>The main app has been around for a while but the Apple Watch app is new – and surprising, because RocketBody began with the goal of producing a wearable fitness and nutrition tracker. That project appears to have been abandoned and the firm is now focusing largely on software.</p>
      <p>The Watch app enables you to control the app’s workout tracking from your wrist, displaying your total elapsed time, your calorie expenditure and your current heart rate in a simple, easy to read format.</p>
      <p>As with most health apps, RocketBody is a freemium app: to benefit from all of its features you need a subscription. But the price of a yearly subscription seems to vary, so if the app appeals it might be wise to time your purchase carefully.</p>
      <h4>Heart Analyzer</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mx8v8ovJ4Ydo9GHeXszxMT.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: Helix Apps LTD)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Heart Analyzer</li>
        <li>Free/IAPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your Apple Watch does a good job of tracking your heart rate, but it doesn’t do such a great job of doing useful things with the data it records. Enter Heart Analyzer, which takes the measurement data and combines it with other data sources to help you develop a much clearer picture of your health and fitness.</p>
      <p>This is the seventh version of the app, and its data can now produce monthly PDF reports (via your iPhone). It also has a new Heart Home screen where you can view personalized metrics such as cardiac exercise levels, VO2 max and maximum and minimum heart rates, and compete them against typical values for your age and biological sex.</p>
      <p>The bulk of the work happens on your phone, but the Apple Watch bit does some interesting things too. It has a constantly updating graph of your heart rate, and for Series 4 or above you can see the graph as a complication without having to open the app. The Watch app also enables you to see key data when you’re doing a workout, combining heart rate information with calories burned and distance traveled. It does an excellent job of presenting a lot of information without being overwhelming or intimidating.</p>
      <h4>Meditation by 10% Happier</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5SWdP5WKQwrvb4usrhsKiV.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: 10% Happier Inc.)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Meditation by 10% Happier</li>
        <li>Free/IAPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some apps promise to change your life. Not this one: it just says it can probably make you 10% happier. Meditation By 10% Happier is a former Apple award winner, offering guided meditations, videos, talks and even content to play as you drift off to sleep. It also provides little nuggets of wisdom you can dip into when you’ve got a moment in your busy day, and the content is updated weekly to stave off familiarity.</p>
      <p>The title comes from the best-selling book and life coaching site Ten Percent Happier, in which ABC news anchor Dan Harris decided to change his life after an on-air panic attack. It’s designed to distil the things Harris found on his journey from skeptic to, well, 10% happier.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect, the bulk of the content is for your phone, but it makes good use of your Apple Watch by reminding you when it’s time to chill and enabling you to play audio meditations from your wrist.</p>
      <p>As with most apps in this genre, the core app is free but most of the content requires a subscription. That’s $99/£87.99/AU$139.99 a year or $9.99/£5.99/AU$11.99 a month, and you can try the app for 7 days before paying.</p>
      <h4>Seven - 7 Minute Workout</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xBDQ9b5UaqrQZ4wgqAT34i.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: Perigee)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Seven - 7 Minute Workout</li>
        <li>Free/IAPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What can you do in seven minutes? You could listen to one and a half pop songs. You could watch one-tenth of an episode of Game of Thrones. Or you could change your life. That’s what Seven promises. It’s an app based on the idea that anybody can get much fitter if they can spare just seven minutes a day. No gym memberships, no equipment, just you and your Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>We’d recommend starting with the phone, though: it shows you how to do each exercise properly, something the Apple Watch’s screen isn’t big enough for. There’s no point knocking yourself out for your seven minute stretch if you’re doing it wrong and causing more harm than good. Once you know what you need to do though you can rely on your Watch to time your exercises and breaks and to record your activity.</p>
      <p>The app is easy to use, packed with useful exercises and provides good visual feedback and motivation. You can compete with your friends or just earn in-app achievements, and if you sign up for the $9.99/£9.99/AU$14.99 monthly subscription you get access to over 200 exercises to keep your regime interesting. By enabling you to exercise anytime, anywhere, Seven might just help you get the exercise habit.</p>
      <h4>Swing Tennis Tracker</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D9EufdKkYU62bnocuxEppE.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>(Image credit: Mangolytics Inc.)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Swing Tennis Tracker</li>
        <li>Free/IAPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Built for serious tennis players under the guidance of Andy Roddick and James Blake, Swing Tennis Tracker is designed to analyze your swings as well as record your stats. It isn’t just a solo app: it can also sync scores with other Apple Watch users on the court. There’s excellent Siri integration for starting matches and practice, integration with the Activity and Health apps, and excellent visual feedback to show you how hard you’re hitting.</p>
      <p>The Watch component concentrates on the recording and feedback, while the phone app takes care of scores, stats and video, as well as providing action advice after each hit. It’s a great app for individual players but it can also be used by parents, coaches and in teams, to track others’ performance too.</p>
      <p>There are two subscription plans, the $4.99/£4.49/AU$7.99 per month Premium and the $9.99/£9.49/AU$15.49 Pro. The former unlocks historical statistic graphics, head-to-head records against non-Swing users and unlimited analysis graphs for each session, while the Pro subscription adds video lessons from tennis pros and intelligent analysis of your performance that identifies key areas for improvement after each session.</p>
      <h4>Start With Yoga</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YG6DEMALsjEwsp74UksYA4.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Image credit: I/O Assembly (Image credit: I/O Assembly)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Start With Yoga</li>
        <li>$2.99/£2.99/AU$4.49</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Start With Yoga does exactly what the name suggests: it’s designed to help you get started with Yoga. It was designed partly out of frustration with other yoga apps, which didn’t come with independent Apple Watch apps. As the developer told us: “Most yoga apps need you to look at your phone, which doesn’t really work for yoga.” Hence this yoga app for your Apple Watch, which enables you to stay far away from the distractions of your iPhone.</p>
      <p>It’s very simple, and that’s part of its charm. You get five pre-defined routines to begin with, and you can use the iPhone part of the app to create your own custom ones from the clear and cute illustrations. Tell the app how long you want to hold a position for, and it will monitor each stretch, moving on to the next one when it’s time.</p>
      <p>The emphasis is very much on yoga beginners here: while the app doesn’t include some of the more advanced positions more experienced practitioners might expect, there’s nothing here that’s likely to put your back out either - although as with any exercise app, always get expert advice if you have any health or fitness issues that might affect your ability to exercise.</p>
      <h4>Tag Heuer Golf</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/epgSTPQgZ6GpFBX9dASq4k.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Tag Heuer Golf</u>
        </li>
        <li>$39.99 / £37.99 / AU$62.99 per year</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may know Tag Heuer for its reassuringly expensive timepieces, but you might not know about its prowess in making smartwatches for golfers. With the new Golf app, the company brings its golfing talents to your Apple Watch.</p>
      <p>The main iPhone app is free, but the Apple Watch companion is only available to subscribers. If you subscribe, you get most of the features of the firm’s smartwatch: maps of nearly 40,000 courses worldwide that tell you where the hazards are, shot distance measurement and real-time statistics. You can track not just your own scores but those of up to three friends too.</p>
      <p>As you’d expect, the companion iPhone app is well designed and makes good use of the information from your Watch: it can show you not just how well you performed today, but how well you performed in your last 20 rounds or all time. It’s packed with stats: the best score to par, the longest shot, the putts per hole… there’s probably a section rating the garishness of your trousers too.</p>
      <p>The price might seem steep but golf doesn’t come cheap – and when you consider that you’re getting much the same feature set as a watch that can cost four figures, it does represent comparatively good value for money.</p>
      <h4>ActivityTracker Pedometer</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YzwotHkpvusxqELikaMrQV.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>ActivityTracker</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free / In-app purchases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We’ve covered ActivityTracker before, and it’s had some significant updates since we last looked. In addition to support for the Apple Watch 4, the latest iPhones, iOS 12 and watchOS 5, it boasts four new complications for the new Infograph watch face and an updated engine to more accurately record activity times.</p>
      <p>As before, the main app is designed to track your activity without using your phone or watch’s GPS features, so it’s less demanding on battery life. It uses your device’s motion processor to record and calculate steps taken, stairs climbed, calories burned, distance traveled and active time, and you can see how well you’re doing on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.</p>
      <p>You can also import your historical data from Apple’s Health app so you’re not starting from a clean slate of data.</p>
      <p>If you subscribe to the Pro version for a modest $4.99 / £4.99 / AU$7.99 it offers complications for instant stats on your Apple Watch and synchronization of steps between iPhone, Watch and the Health app. Pro users can also move data from one iPhone to another. Whether you subscribe or not the Watch app gives you an overview of the last hour, day and week in the form of attractive and effective graphs.</p>
      <h4>Slopes</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FykMKpZwcaK7etRdRyHapd.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Slopes</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free (in-app purchases)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Late in 2018, Apple introduced improved snowboarding and skiing tracking for the Apple Watch Series 3 and later. That’s been a boon for snow apps such as Slopes, which can use the improved APIs to gather more useful information than ever before.</p>
      <p>With Slopes you can track your speed, vertical, distance, lift vs trail time and more, getting the information you need right now on your wrist and sharing that data with the iPhone so you can analyze it later.</p>
      <p>Slopes is very clever. It automatically detects runs and lifts, it can replay your runs in 3D with heat maps showing your speed on each bit of the run, and it even integrates with your photo library to automatically display photos you took on your skiing or snowboarding trips. The app also integrates with the Apple Health app, recording details of your workouts and the calories you’ve burned.</p>
      <p>As with many sport apps the core version of Slopes is free but there’s also a premium subscription that introduces extra features. Here that means live run-by-run breakdowns, unlimited run and lift stat breakdowns, premium maps and even virtual 3D mountains to show you where you’ve been. An annual pass is a very reasonable $19.99/£12.49/AU$17.99.</p>
      <h4>Strava</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JHf3RZoYWGR9AFn2hYfMYA.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Strava</li>
        <li>Free / in-app purchases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Strava is one of the most popular running and cycling apps around, but it’s always required you to have your phone or a non-Apple smartwatch to track your travels and record your vital statistics. Not anymore.</p>
      <p>If you have an Apple Watch 2, the Strava Apple Watch app can use its GPS to record your run without requiring you to strap a phone to anything. The interface isn’t as pretty as the iPhone app’s interface, but when you’re running or cycling that doesn’t matter: the information you need is presented cleanly enough and the app is simple and straightforward to use.</p>
      <p>The main app is free and offers essential features including distance, pace, speed, elevation and burned calories, and there’s a premium service for $5.99/£5.99/AU$9.99 per month or $59.99/£54.99/AU$89.99 per year that offers more detailed post-exercise analysis, live performance feedback and personalized coaching - although not through the Watch.</p>
      <p>However, if you’re someone who uses the premium features like Beacon on the main app, you might not find Strava on the Apple Watch to your liking compared to using it on the phone.</p>
      <h4>Nike Run Club</h4>

        <li>Free</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The ongoing love-fest between Nike and Apple continues to bear fruit: the latest iteration of the Nike Run Club app introduces some welcome improvements. </p>
      <p>It now integrates with Siri Suggestions, which means the app can now suggest good times for a run based on your previous runs (the feature is off by default so it won’t nag you if you don’t want it to), and there are new Apple Watch complications including one for the Infograph face that shows how far you’ve run this month.</p>
      <p>There’s hardly a shortage of running apps in the App Store but Nike’s budget is a bit higher than most, so the app feels a lot more premium than many others. It tracks and stores all your runs thanks to your Watch’s built-in GPS, enables you to listen to audio guides as you run, offers a range of challenges to keep you motivated and has good social sharing features, so you can turn your friends into cheerleaders. </p>
      <p>It’s very well designed and the Watch app doesn’t sacrifice substance for style: while visually it’s very attractive it also shows all the information you actually need as you’re pounding the pavements. It’s a really good running app.</p>
      <h4>Nike Training Club</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LWeieqyVAkGjaCEbZmGGE.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Nike Training Club</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Nike and Apple are best friends forever, so it’s not a huge surprise to see Nike unveil another Watch app. This one’s really good, too. Describing itself as “your ultimate personal trainer”, Nike Training Club has more than 180 workouts covering strength, endurance, mobility and yoga, and they’re all free. There are daily personalized picks based on your previous activity, flexible training plans to help you achieve your fitness goals, and tips from top trainers.</p>
      <p>The app splits jobs between phone and Watch. The former is where you do the planning and tracking; the latter is what you wear while you’re actually working out. By necessity as well as design that means focusing only on the information you really need right now, such as your heart rate and how many reps you still have to do before you can undo all your efforts with some cake and beer.</p>
      <p>The app is by no means unique in its combination of Watch and workout tracking, although it does have Nike’s immediately recognizable and individual visual style. But what’s significant about this app is that none of its many workouts are hidden behind in-app purchases or pricey subscriptions. Everything in the app is free.</p>
      <h4>Headspace</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHMr9UGWWbHiSyGDMhAwKB.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Headspace</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free + in-app purchases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you’ve ever felt that life is just that bit too busy or stressful, Headspace could help. It’s based around mindfulness, which is all about getting you to feel calmer without too much effort. In fact, it’s the opposite of effort: mindfulness is about taking a break from the rush.</p>
      <p>The Apple Watch app is part of a wider offering for iPhone and iPad: it acts as a reminder and a coach, urging you to pick an exercise and focus on it for the allotted time. It also has an SOS mode for when things feel too much and you need help instantly. But it’s the main app that does most of the work, with daily mindfulness exercises and sessions designed to help with everything from workplace stress to sleep problems.</p>
      <p>It’s very well done but one thing that might raise your stress levels is the cost: while the app is free to try it really needs a subscription to unlock its most useful features, and that subscription is $12.99/£9.99/AU$19.99 per month or $94.99/£74.99/AU$149.99 per year. That’s an auto-renewing subscription too, so you need to disable that in iTunes if you don’t want it to recur automatically.</p>
      <h4>WebMD</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UYDeD6dPLpVELXYBACVEif.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>WebMD</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Medical apps don’t just exist to persuade you that your mild headache is terminal brain cancer. They can help keep you healthy too. While WebMD does indeed let you compare your symptoms with various illnesses and conditions to scare yourself silly, that’s not the most interesting thing about it or its Watch companion app.</p>
      <p>WebMD enables you to detail your medication schedules, with dosage information and the option to be reminded of what you need to take and when you need to take it. This can be in the form of a notification, or you can have it as a Watch face Complication so it’s right there in the middle of the display.</p>
      <p>It can also remind you of any prerequisites, such as whether you need to take your medicine with food or on an empty stomach. It’s the sort of simple but very useful thing the Apple Watch does well.</p>
      <p>Over on the main iPhone app there’s plenty more to discover. You can read up on the side effects and precautions of specific pills or patches, find out if you need to go hiding from the flu or just catch up on the latest health and wellbeing news from various credible sources.</p>
      <h4>WorkOutDoors</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qsqqbvDWKvuKkbmSSrnV2k.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>WorkOutDoors</u>
        </li>
        <li>$2.99/£2.99/AU$4.49</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your idea of good exercise involves going far from the madding crowds, you’ll like WorkOutDoors. It’s a workout app that’s based around vector maps that you can easily rotate and zoom, tracking your location and your progress.</p>
      <p>It uses the Watch’s GPS (if you have a GPS-enabled Watch) so there’s no need to take your phone on a hike, cycle or snowboard run, and features such as breadcrumb tracking, custom points of interest and customizable stats displays enable you to make the app truly your own.</p>
      <p>In a nice touch you can export your workouts from the iPhone app in GPX format, which can be imported into many other workout apps and sites.</p>
      <p>It’s very, very well thought out. For example, something as simple as the stats display is available in a variety of sizes to suit different kinds of activity (not to mention different levels of eyesight).</p>
      <p>It makes good use of color-coding to make routes crystal clear, waypoints can provide extra information such as directions, and the map automatically rotates as you move so you’re always sure of the right direction. It’s a brilliant app for pretty much any outdoor activity.</p>
      <h4>Streaks</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FuUwMt7CctxnptFUsxEyAZ.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Streaks</u>
        </li>
        <li>$4.99/£4.99/AU$7.99</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The trick to living better isn’t to damn near kill yourself on a treadmill and then give up after a few weeks. It’s to make smaller, lasting changes to your life, changes that you can and will actually stick to. And that’s what Streaks offers.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re trying to eat more healthily, exercise more or break a smoking habit, Streaks enables you to track positive and negative habits. It offers a range of reporting tools so you can see exactly how well you’re doing, and you can track up to 12 different tasks at once.</p>
      <p>They needn’t be exercise or eating tasks: you can remind yourself to walk the dog, study, take vitamins or practice a musical instrument. It’s good to see wheelchair users included in the default tasks list too.</p>
      <p>Where Streaks really shines is in its integration with the Health app, which enables it to pull data to use for monitoring suitable targets you’ve set. That reduces a lot of the form-filling of similar apps, and it’s particularly effective if you’re trying to work on good healthy habits or eliminate unhealthy ones, or both.</p>
      <p>There’s a Complication too, so that you don’t forget your goals, and the whole thing is customizable so that you can get it just-so.</p>
      <h4>MyFitnessPal</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29932a17be76ece77e9c73ad0c87cbed.jpg"/>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>MyFitnessPal</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free + IAPs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Information is power and if you're trying to lose weight, calorie tracking is a good way to stay focused. MyFitnessPal works out a daily calorie allowance based on how much weight you want to shed. Eat a meal and your allowance is spent, take exercise and you earn credit.</p>
      <p>The Watch gives you a running total of remaining calories and how that breaks down into protein, carbohydrates and more. It can integrate with your steps total so you don't have to add those manually. It's simple but convenient and helpful.</p>
      <h4>Walkmeter GPS Pedometer</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ef2daf56dd4645ef2797411677186b70.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Walkmeter</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free +  $9.99/£9.99/AU$14.99 IAP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If walking's your thing, Walkmeter helps track your every step, showing your perambulations on a map and generating detailed graphs. The Watch app has clear data reporting and you can start and stop a walk from your wrist using the Watch's Force Touch actions.</p>
      <p>Apple's own Workout app does a lot, but this app has more detail and the mapping detail on the iPhone is great. The app is free but for full Watch performance you need to upgrade to the Elite version for $9.99/£9.99/AU$14.99. There's a lot here, including training plans and announcements as you hit targets or distances.</p>
      <h4>CARROT Fit</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zCY3dyvrDUu9q8ebHtcDDS.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>CARROT Fit</u>
        </li>
        <li>$3.99/£3.99/AU$5.99</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You may know CARROT from its weather app, which combines Dark Sky-style weather forecasting with sarcasm and lies. But CARROT wants to make you unhappy in many other ways - and what’s better for a sadistic AI than being in control of a fitness app?</p>
      <p>Enter CARROT Fit, which takes a somewhat unusual approach to motivating you to get healthier and lose weight.</p>
      <p>CARROT promises to “get you fit - or else”. To achieve that it offers a dozen punishing exercises (more are available via in-app purchases) accompanied by threats, ridicule, bribes and the occasional compliment.</p>
      <p>It’s rude, crude and much more entertaining than trying to complete the rings on Apple’s own activity tracker, and we’re pretty sure it’s the only fitness app that rewards progress with cat facts. But there’s a proper fitness tracker in here too: it’ll track your steps and weight loss, remember your workouts and add data to Apple’s health app.</p>
      <p>Most of the personality is in the main iPhone app, but the Watch alerts include such cheery prospects as “seven minutes in hell”. If you find getting fit or losing weight a little bit tedious, CARROT might be the, ahem, carrot that you need to get motivated.</p>
      <h4>Lose It!</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cjZVXZW6pYx6kREYnaxfUH.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Lose It!</li>
        <li>Free / in-app purchases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If your Watch strap is feeling a little more snug than it used to, this app may be the answer: it’s designed to help you achieve your weight loss goals “without the unsustainable gimmicks, fad diets, restrictive foods, on-site meetings, or large price tags of other weight-loss companies.”</p>
      <p>It tracks the calories you’ve consumed and the goals you’ve set, focuses on nutrition as well as overall calorie intake, works happily with other fitness apps and trackers and provides an online peer group where everybody encourages each other to achieve their ideal weight.</p>
      <p>It also enables you to set exercise goals and focus on general wellness, so it’s not just about losing weight.</p>
      <p>The Apple Watch app doesn’t replace the phone app completely - for example, you’ll need your phone handy if you want to use the barcode scanner to automatically record what you’re eating, and the team-based features such as group challenges are phone-based - but it’s a great way to focus on your goals, monitor your progress and keep your motivation no matter how sorely tempted you may be.</p>
      <p>The program is $39.99/£29.99/AU$62.99 per year but you can explore the app for free without signing up.</p>
      <h4>Mount Burnmore</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DZgdwPZX96VTpK9J699kK9.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>Mount Burnmore</li>
        <li>Free / in-app purchases</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Fitness fanatics look away now: for those that find exercise really boring, and their get up and go often gets up and goes while they stay sedentary. Mount Burnmore could be the answer to that lethargy: it turns fitness into a game.</p>
      <p>The concept is quite clever. Mount Burnmore depends on “active energy”, which it pulls from the Health app: the more calories you’ve burned, the more active energy you have in the game.</p>
      <p>When you have sufficient energy you can attempt to solve the game’s puzzles, which involve finding routes around the titular mountain, collecting in-game items and smashing things with a pickaxe.</p>
      <p>There’s a Complication that enables you to see your progress without launching the full game, and the app makes good use of the Digital Crown to help you navigate around larger levels later in the game. There are also leaderboards to compare with other players and in-game challenges to win freebies.</p>
      <p>It’s bright, breezy and a bit brash, and we suspect it’s best suited to older children rather than grown-ups - although if you do give this one to the kids you might want to disable in-app purchases, as they can be used to buy in-game items.</p>
      <h4>Happier</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JYkeS6HTDohhPPoUSCZHUi.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <u>Happier</u>
        </li>
        <li>Free</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mindfulness, the art of focusing on being present and aware in the world instead of being constantly distracted by things and thoughts that don’t matter, isn’t something you’d associate with the Apple Watch. If you aren’t careful with your notification settings your Watch pings away merrily all day, interrupting countless trains of thought.</p>
      <p>But the Happier app hopes to use the Watch to make you feel better, not more harassed.</p>
      <p>The app itself is free, but it’s designed as a gateway to paid-for mindfulness courses. If you don’t go for them you can still take advantage of the app, though. You can tell the app how you’re feeling - we suspect “meh” is the most-used option - and it then responds with uplifting quotes to help you feel a bit more optimistic.</p>
      <p>It can pop up to remind you to take a meditation break, and you can dictate a positive thought to a private journal or to the Happier community. That’s not as daft as it sounds: there’s some evidence that keeping a journal of positive things can boost your mood over time.</p>
      <p>Just be careful what and how you share: one iTunes reviewer says that they were able to locate their private journal with Google.</p>
