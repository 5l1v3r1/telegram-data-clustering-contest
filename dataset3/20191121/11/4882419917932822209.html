      <p>Real Zaragoza have made a new attempt to land Riqui Puig. The club are desperate to add the talented youngster to their ranks and is someone the coach, Victor Fernandez, has personally asked for. Everyone at Zaragoza wants to make this deal happen.</p>
      <p>Currently in LaLiga 2, pushing for promotion to the first division, Zaragoza are drawing up names of players who could strengthen their squad in January. Riqui is at the top of their list.</p>
      <p>The interest from Zaragoza isn't exactly new either. They tried to sign Riqui on loan in August but both Barça and the player turned it down. As everybody knows, Riqui's dream is to play for the first team but after seeing his chances limited this year, he's now more open to a temporary solution.</p>
