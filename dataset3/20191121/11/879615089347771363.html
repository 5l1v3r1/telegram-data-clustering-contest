      <p><b>Zendaya Wanted Her Tommy Hilfiger Collab to Fit the Women In Her Family (<a href="https://www.allure.com/story/zendaya-cover-interview-2020">Allure</a>)</b><br/>“I’m not going to make clothes my sister or my niece or any of the women in my family can’t wear,” Zendaya recently said of her Tommy Hilfiger collab. “A lot of the clothes were for tall people too. For my mom, this is the first time that she can wear pants and not get them altered — she’s six feet four.”</p>
      <p>Zendaya also went on to describe how her familial connections inspired some of her acting in <i>Euphoria</i>. “It was written in the script that Rue had this big hoodie,” she explains. “You can tell when she’s having a good day or feels good because her hoodie is not covering her entirely, and then when she’s not feeling it, she’s basically hiding in this giant hoodie. When I was 11, my grandfather passed, and we had all his old clothes. I thought it would be cool if we made [it clear that] the hoodie was Rue’s [late] dad’s hoodie. [I wanted to capture] that attachment that you have to inanimate objects when somebody passes.”</p>

      <p><b>Employees Claim Hearst Is Trying to Union Bust (<a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/hearst-is-urging-employees-to-withdraw-their-union-cards.html">Intelligencer</a>)</b><br/>Last week, Hearst employees announced their <a href="https://fashionweekdaily.com/hearst-staff-union-instagram-removes-likes/">intention to unionize</a>. Now, staffers claim that the company is characterizing the union “as a threat to Hearst’s company culture and values.” Apparently, executives are urging employees to withdraw their union cards, and management is not likely to voluntarily recognize the union.</p>
      <p>“They told me, verbatim, that if I didn’t trust them, I didn’t have to work there,” an anonymous staffer told <i>Intelligencer.</i> “They’re playing really, really nasty in a way that is very upsetting to a lot of people because we work very, very hard for the company.”</p>

      <p><b>Slick Woods Reveals Chemotherapy Treatments (<a href="https://www.papermag.com/slick-woods-cancer-chemo-2641412963.html?rebelltitem=8#rebelltitem8">Paper</a>)</b><br/>Slick Woods revealed on Instagram that she is going through chemotherapy treatments. “How I feel about chemotherapy, shout out to everyone that gotta go through it.” She wrote, adding: “#atleastimalreadybald.” While Woods has not disclosed the nature of her illness, she is clear that she doesn’t want people to pile on with sympathy. In a second post (presumably a reference to the first), she writes: “Stop treating me like a victim.”</p>
