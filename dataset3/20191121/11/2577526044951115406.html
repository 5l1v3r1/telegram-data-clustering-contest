      <h1>Yu Suzuki Says He Wants to Make Shenmue 4</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:27:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/20/shenmue-3-feels-like-a-90s-throwback-for-better-and-for-worse">It took 18 years for <i>Shenmue III</i> to finally grace our screens</a>, but director Yu Suzuki is already promising to deliver a sequel. In a message hidden in the game's credits, Suzuki said he would "never give up" on the series.</p>
      <p>In that message (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yu-suzuki-pledges-to-try-to-make-shenmue-4-via-in-game-letter-to-fans/">VGC</a>), the director says that "For as long as there are those who wish to see Shenmue live on, I will never give up on my own personal journey to complete its story. As with <i>Shenmue 3</i>, the Shenmue story is with you. I sincerely hope that, together, we can continue to spin the tale of Ryo and his adventures in <i>Shenmue 4</i>."</p>
      <p>That's a pretty big statement of intent when it comes to the next game in the series, but perhaps it should come as no surprise. Suzuki has previously made clear that the new release only gets us about 50% of the way through the full Shenmue arc, so with that in mind, one could extrapolate that into two or three more follow-ups. Going on the series' current release cadence, Suzuki would be in his late 90s by the time a fourth Shenmue game was ready for release, so let's hope he's aiming for a slightly quicker turnaround this time.</p>
