      <p>Coldplay’s new track Champion Of The World pays tribute to Scott Hutchison after his tragic death.</p>
      <p>The band are honouring the Frightened Rabbit frontman for his birthday (20 November).</p>
      <p>The musician, who inspired Coldplay frontman Chris Martin with his track Los Angeles Be Kind, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/05/11/scott-hutchison-confirmed-found-dead-police-7538616/">sadly took his own life back in May 2018 after struggling with depression and anxiety.</a></p>
      <p>Chris has explained that the new song from the band’s upcoming album Everyday Life is inspired by the track, which Scott wrote as part of his solo music project Owl John.</p>

      <p>‘Scott had a song called Los Angeles Be Kind, which I love,’ Chris said. ‘When I first heard it, I thought it was going to go one way – but it went another. Anyway Champion Of The World is the song that came from following the other path, and that’s why Scott is a co-writer on this song.</p>

      <p>‘Today is also his birthday. So happy birthday Scott and thank you for your beautiful music, wherever you are.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Scott’s Frightened Rabbit bandmate Simon Liddell described the Coldplay track as ‘a beautiful song’.</p>
      <p>‘Hopefully through Coldplay, more people will discover the Owl John, and the Frightened Rabbit back catalogue,’ he <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-champion-of-the-world-daddy-scott-hutchison-owl-john-interview-2569888">added to NME</a>. ‘Earlier this year, Coldplay got in touch again, having recorded a sister version of the song.</p>

      <p>‘The Coldplay camp have been amazing – keeping us in the loop on the track’s progress at each stage. We’re grateful to have played a part in that.’</p>
      <p>Scott was confirmed dead back in May last year at the age of 36 after going missing.</p>
      <p>In his final tweets, he said: ‘Be so good to everyone you love. It’s not a given. I’m so annoyed that it’s not. I didn’t live by that standard and it kills me. Please, hug your loved ones.’</p>
      <p>At 4.09pm, he wrote: ‘I’m away now. Thanks.’</p>
      <p>Hutchison was celebrated for being open about his struggles with his mental health in his music,<a href="http://metro.co.uk/2018/05/11/scott-hutchison-talked-suicidal-thoughts-final-interview-body-found-search-frightened-rabbit-star-7537749/"> with the star talking about being ‘consumed by the negatives’</a> in an interview just weeks before his death.</p>
