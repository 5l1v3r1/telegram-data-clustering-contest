      <p>The iconic Fireman's Arms pub in Buitengracht Street in central Cape Town was damaged in a fire in the early hours of Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>Owner Kevin Phelan told News24 that the damage was limited to the beer garden and the pub's structures escaped harm.</p>
      <p>"There was an electrical fire in the bar outside," he said.</p>
      <p>"We are closed for today but we will let people know when we are open again."</p>
      <p>The City's Fire and Rescue Services spokesperson Jermaine Carelse said they responded to an emergency call of the building alight at 02:51.</p>
      <p>"Two fire engines, a rescue vehicle and 12 staff were on scene. The fire was extinguished at 04:24," he said.<br/><br/>"The entire outside serving area, consisting of tables and chairs was destroyed. The exterior of the building was only slightly damaged by the fire."</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported and the fire service was investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
      <p>Dean Ryan took a video of the fire while on his way to work. The video, which is trending on social media, shows the outside seating area in flames.</p>
      <p>The pub is one of the oldest in Cape Town, established in 1864 as a local drinking spot for sailors and locals.</p>
      <p>According to the website, it changed its name to the Fireman's Arms in honour of steamship coal stokers who frequented the joint.</p>
