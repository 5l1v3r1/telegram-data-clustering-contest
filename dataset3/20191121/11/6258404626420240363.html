      <h3>Google Pixelbook Go: An Affordable Windows Laptop Alternative</h3>

      <p>Google's new <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/pixelbook-go">Pixelbook Go</a> is a bit of an anomaly in the company's line of <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/chromebooks">Chromebooks</a>. Neither a folding, swiveling ultra-premium device like the original Google Pixelbook, nor a tablet like the Pixel Slate, the company's newest release is a traditional clamshell design, although one that features a touch-enabled display. It looks, feels, and behaves like a conventional laptop, but with its magnesium chassis, 1080p touchscreen, and quiet "Hush Keys," one that's small, light, feature-rich and well-made. That said, though its premium mobile laptop is fairly conventional, Google's Pixelbook line takes a somewhat unconventional cloud-first approach to computing on the go. </p>

      <p><i><b>Pixelbook Go accessories available from Google - </b><b>purpose-built backpack ($129), fitted sleeve ($49)<br/></b></i><br/>The new machine is also unusual in another way; it's affordable. Well, affordable for a Pixelbook, at any rate. While the original <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/pixelbook-">Pixelbook </a>lists for $999 and can be found on the street for <a href="https://amzn.to/2qo9Qmr">as little as $899</a>, with the Pixel Slate for <a href="https://amzn.to/2CVEWEA">as little as $775</a>, you can snag the entry-level <a href="https://amzn.to/35f005p">Pixelbook Go for $649</a>.<br/><br/>But then things get confusing, and needlessly so.</p>

      <p>There are actually three versions of the Pixelbook Go. The $649 entry-level machine includes an 8th-gen m3 processor, 8GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and a very sharp, glossy, 16:9, 1080p touch-enabled display. For an additional $200, you get the same beautiful magnesium chassis and display, plus a <a href="https://amzn.to/2XtdTdp">Core i5 processor and 128GB</a> of storage. You can keep going, but, honestly, you probably should consider thees moves carefully. $1000 gets you an additional 8GB of RAM, and a top-of-the-line Pixelbook Go includes a 4K display, Core i7 processor, and 256GB of storage that will run you $1,400. Pro tip: $1,400 is a helluva lot of money for a Chromebook. If you're buying a Chromebook, that is if a Chromebook will do the job for you, you probably don't need to spend the extra money on more storage and higher-end displays. After all, you'll probably be working with fairly mainstream workloads with a Chromebook, and for most such undertakings, the basic Pixelbook Go will more than do the job. <br/><br/>Google sent us the $850 Core i5 / 128GB of storage model, and this evaluation will center on this variant that we feel will satisfy most Chromebook use cases with ease.</p>

      <p>Google's new Chromebook is available in only two colors: There is a jet black unit the company sent us to review and then something Google insists on calling "not pink." (Spoiler: It's pink.)<br/><br/>Weighing in at just a little over two and a quarter pounds, the Pixelbook Go we're testing has 8GB of RAM and a dual-core Intel <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/core-i5">Core i5</a> processor under its hood. Is that enough to get the job done for most of what you'd look for in a Chromebook? Let's look at the experiential side of things next...</p>
      <p>The Pixelbook Go is a bit of an anomaly in Google's Pixelbook line: Neither a folding, swiveling 4-in-1 device like the original Google Pixelbook, nor a tablet like the Pixel Slate, the company's newest release is a traditional clamshell design, although one that features a touch-enabled display. It looks, feels, and behaves like a conventional laptop, but with its magnesium chassis, 1080p touchscreen, and quiet "Hush Keys," one that's small, light, feature-rich, and extremely well-made.</p>

If you're buying a Chromebook, that is, if a Chromebook will do the job for you, you probably don't need to spend the extra money on more storage, a fancier display, etc. After all, you'll probably doing fairly basic things with your Chromebook (not that you’re limited to that; see below), and for most such undertakings, the basic Pixelbook Go will more than do the job. Stick to the $850 version; even the $649 version will more than suffice in most cases. (Google sent us the $850 i5 model, so this review will center on that.)</p>
