      <p>Augustine Nsinga pleaded guilty to one offence of playing unlicensed music after permitted hours and two offences of supplying false information to obtain temporary licenses.</p>
      <p>Wolverhampton Magistrates Court heard that Nsinga, who operates The Coast Afro Cuisine in King Street, was in effect running it as a nightclub – having unlicensed music after permitted hours.</p>
      <p>In addition, she applied for temporary licenses allegedly for family celebrations, but investigations of social media showed that these were to allow known DJs and their followers to use the premises as a venue.</p>
      <p>Police checked the premises in the early hours one weekend in January and discovered unlicensed activity. The information was passed to Dudley Council's licensing team and further investigation found the false application offences.</p>
      <p>On November 14, the court sentenced Nsinga to a fine of £300 on each offence, a victim surcharge of £30 and contribution towards costs in the sum of £500 – adding up to a total of £1,430.</p>
      <p>The case was brought to court by Dudley Council.</p>
      <p>Alan Lunt, deputy chief executive at Dudley Council, said: "This is a great example of the council, police and community members working together to ensure justice is served.</p>
      <p>"It is a reminder to licence holders that they need to ensure they are fully compliant or they too could face the strong arm of the law."</p>
      <p>As a result of the prosecution, The Coast Afro Cuisine is now operating with a new license with strict conditions attached.</p>
