      <h1>General Election 2019: Tax hikes to cover multi-billion-pound spending spree, Labour manifesto reveals</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:39:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:39</time> by <a rel="author">Catherine Neilan</a></address>
      <p>Labour is planning to spend a whopping £82 billion additional on day-to-day spending, which will be paid for additional taxes on wealthy, business and the City.</p>
      <p>Here are a few of the key pledges revealed today</p>
      <h3>Tax</h3>
      <p>Labour says it will pay for its multi-billion pound give-away through a "fairer taxation system, asking for a little more from those with the broadest shoulders, and making sure that everyone pays what they owe".</p>
      <p>This includes reversing cuts to corporation tax - although the manifesto pledges to keeping rates lower than in 2010.</p>
      <h3>'Use it or lose it' tax for developers</h3>
      <blockquote>We will use public land to build this housing, not sell it off to the highest<br/>bidder. Developers will face new ‘use it or lose it’ taxes on stalled housing developments. We will keep the Land Registry in public hands, and make ownership of land more transparent. We will make brownfield sites the priority for development and protect the green belt.</blockquote>
      <h3>Private schools</h3>
      <p>Fee-paying schools will lose their VAT exemption:</p>
      <blockquote>We will close the tax loopholes enjoyed by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children</blockquote>
      <h3>Windfall tax on oil companies</h3>
      <blockquote>...so that the companies that knowingly damaged our climate will help cover the costs. We will provide a strategy to safeguard the people, jobs and skills that depend on the offshore oil and gas industry</blockquote>
      <h3>Brexit</h3>
      <p>On freedom of movement, the manifesto is less emphatic than the position agreed at Labour's party conference last month. It says:</p>
      <blockquote>If we remain in the EU, freedom of movement would continue. If we leave, it will be subject to negotiations, but we recognise the social and economic benefits that free movement has brought both in terms of EU citizens here and UK citizens abroad – and we will seek to protect those rights.</blockquote>
