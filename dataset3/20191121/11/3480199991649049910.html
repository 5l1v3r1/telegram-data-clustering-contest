      <p>Snapchat is aiming to lure more users on to its photo-sharing app with a new filter that allows people to change the age of their appearance.</p>
      <p>The Time Machine feature works as a slider, making faces appear younger from one end and older in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p>Platform owner Snap will be hoping to replicate previous successful filters such as gender swapping, which became popular after a number of celebrities shared their own results on social media.</p>

      <p>According to the firm, more than 70% of its daily users play with or view Lenses every day to transform the way they look.</p>
      <p>In October, Snapchat reported that it had added another seven million daily active users in its latest quarter, while losses narrowed.</p>
      <p>It managed to attract 210 million daily active users in the three months to the end of September, up 13% year-over-year.</p>
      <p>The company continued to operate at a net loss, but edged a step closer to profitability, with losses shrinking to 227.3 million dollars (£176.5 million) this period, compared with 255.2 million dollars (£198.1 million) the three months before.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year FaceApp service went viral again with a similar ageing feature, though there was some concern about the Russia-based company’s privacy policy.</p>
