      <p>Many people often say that the hearts of children are pure until society contaminates it. Well, that seems to be the case of a group of young boys whose touching gesture has melted hearts on social media.</p>
      <p>A Nigerian man identified as Shariff Yeng on Facebook took to the social media application to share the heart-melting thing the young boys did for their friend.</p>
      <p>According to Yeng, the young pupils had assembled at the hospital to visit their school friend who had been involved in a bike accident.</p>
      <p>Yeng wrote: <i>“I came across these boys discussing stuff and laughing all around at the hospital-TTH. I asked what happened and I was told the boy in Red was knocked down by a motorbike on his way to school. So his friends took permission from school to come see him and have a moment with their friend. It was just so beautiful and it showed me what friendship should be</i>”</p>
