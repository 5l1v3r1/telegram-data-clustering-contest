      <h1>Man wants to reunite a best man with the wedding speech he left in a book</h1>

      <p>Due to give a speech and in need of inspiration?</p>
      <p>You might want to go flicking through some old books.</p>
      <p>Reece Wane, 27, was lucky enough to find a best man’s speech – albeit one that’s a tad cringey – stuffed in the pages of a secondhand book</p>
      <p>Reece had ordered a book about the Teutonic Knights for £6.50 from Amazon Marketplace.</p>
      <p>As he was flicking through the pages, two pieces of A4 paper fell out. It turned out those pieces of paper contained a best man’s speech packed with jokes and puns.</p>
      <p>Is it a speech we’d recommend copying? Perhaps not.</p>
      <p>But it could jog your creative juices if you’re staring at a blank page. Next time you’ve got writer’s block, go to a secondhand bookshop and leaf through the pages.</p>

      <p>The speech was written for the wedding of a Tom Fletcher and his wife-to-be Becky (so no, not the guy from McFly).</p>
      <p>Now, Reece hopes to track down the mystery best man and reunite him with his speech.</p>
      <p>The speech starts with a joke: ‘If anyone here feels nervous, apprehensive or queasy… It’s probably because you’ve just got married to Tom Fletcher’.</p>
      <p>Then it compares Tom’s dancing to that of David Brent, jokes about the groom’s work ethic, and says that Becky ‘couldn’t have done any worse’.</p>

      <p>There’s also the classic line of referring to the speech as the ‘worst five minutes of your life’, then saying ‘Becky – your worst five minutes will probably come later tonight’.</p>
      <p>Hotel manager Reece, from Leeds, said: ‘I thought it was absolutely hilarious.</p>
      <p>‘It’s so generic and he’s used so many classic British humour jokes.</p>
      <p>‘There is some real personal stuff in there and you can see he’s properly trying to wind his best mate up.</p>
      <p>‘When I found it me and Molly had such a laugh about it.</p>
      <p>‘I was really surprised because I was just sat there with a brew and it popped out.</p>
      <p>‘I wonder if he popped it in there for safekeeping and just forgot where he put it.</p>
      <p>‘If the wedding hasn’t happened yet then I do want to get it back to him before the big day. There’s a lot of work gone into it.’</p>

      <p>The speech suggests the wedding of Tom and Becky Fletcher will take place on 5 June – but doesn’t say in what year.</p>

      <p>Reece said: ‘We have tried to track down the author but haven’t had any luck.</p>
      <p>‘From one bloke to another I’d like to get it back to him.</p>
      <p>‘It takes a lot of hard work to write a best man’s speech. He probably spent says writing it and now he has lost it.</p>
      <p>‘If I’d lost one I’d be gutted, the wedding might not have even happened yet.</p>
      <p>‘It hasn’t been there for long because the paper is really fresh.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve got his back if he wants to have it returned for sure.’</p>
