      <p>Andy Whyment might be a late arrival to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! jungle but he’s certainly not getting an easy ride.</p>
      <p>In scenes due to air tonight, the Coronation Street star is put through his paces as he’s confronted with his first-ever Bushtucker Trial, which sees him trapped in a shed packed with ‘loads of guts and worms’ and with pigeons thrown in for good measure, because why not?</p>
      <p>Named the Frontier Of Fear, Andy, who’s<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-new-campmates-andy-whyment-and-cliff-parisi-pose-with-aussie-wildlife-ahead-of-jungle-debut-11183275/"> joined the show alongside EastEnders’ Cliff Parisi</a>, was tasked with finding stars around the house of horrors while presenters Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly observe from a safe space.</p>

      <p>‘How does it smell?’ Ant asked from a distance.</p>
      <p>‘Absolutely disgusting,’ replied Andy. ‘This absolutely stinks.’</p>
      <p>‘Everything is covered in offal and fish guts,’ Dec added as a nice little welcome reminder.</p>

      <p>But that wasn’t the only obstacle as there were also birds flying over Andy’s head.</p>
      <p>‘There are 25 pigeons in there with you,’ Ant revealed.</p>
      <p>‘I bet you’re having a right good laugh out there aren’t you?’ Any replied.</p>

      <p>Andy’s challenge comes just one day after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-a-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-uses-the-spirit-of-jane-mcdonald-to-wolf-down-camel-anus-and-vomit-fruit-in-foul-bushtucker-trial-11190226/">Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp faced camel anus and vomit fruit for their Bushtucker Trial</a>.</p>
      <p>Each campmate was presented with a different ‘dessert’ which they had to scoff to win meals for the camp, with Roman taking on a meal of dead cockroaches, crickets and mealworms, eating three of each to gain a star for camp.</p>
      <p>He described the crickets as being like ‘quite cheesy, cheesy eggs’ which sounded pretty grim.</p>
      <p>Adele was then given vomit fruit to eat, and as she gagged and retched, she said: ‘It’s like your dog’s been sick and you have to eat it.’</p>
