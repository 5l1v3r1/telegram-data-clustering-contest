      <p>Three Spanish footballers have gone on trial today accused of a gang sex attack on a 15-year-old.</p>
      <p>State prosecutors are seeking prison sentences totalling 118 years for the trio - 40 for one and 39 for the other two - if they are found guilty.</p>
      <p>The trial, scheduled to last until next Wednesday, will be held behind closed doors to avoid any contact between the defendants and the alleged victim and her family.</p>
      <p>The men, who were playing for third division Spanish side Arandina when they were arrested in December 2017, have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>The alleged victim claims she was sexually assaulted by all three men after accepting an invite to the flat they shared in Aranda de Duero two hours drive north of Madrid.</p>
      <p>She told an investigating judge after the trio were held they had stripped her and forced her to perform sex acts before one of them raped her.</p>
      <p>State prosecutors demanded a 40-year prison sentence for Raul Calvo, 19 when he was arrested, in an indictment presented to the court ahead of the trial at Burgos Provincial Court.</p>
      <p>They are seeking a prison sentence of 39 years each for the other two defendants, Carlos Cuadrado and Victor Rodriguez, who were 24 and 22 at the time of the alleged November 24 2017 crime.</p>
      <p>None now play for Arandina FC after being expelled from the club in the wake of the scandal.</p>
      <p>The players, who were held in prison for three months on remand before being released on bail, have admitted the teenager was in their flat but insist she left without anything happening and they claim she is lying about the sex attack.</p>
      <p>Their defence lawyers have demanded their acquittal.</p>
      <p>Day one of the players’ trial coincides with the last day of the trial of four of the five men convicted of the so-called ‘Wolf Pack’ gang rape of a woman during Spain’s famous Running of the Bulls festival in Pamplona in July 2016.</p>
      <p>They are accused of sexually molesting a 21-year-old in a separate incident after offering her a lift home from an annual festival in the village of Torrecampo near the southern Spanish city of Cordoba.</p>
