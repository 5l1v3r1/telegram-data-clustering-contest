      <p>Christmas Day isn’t complete until you’ve had a full blown fight with your nan about who won the cracker present.</p>
      <p>Those paper hats are also a prerequisite for a festive time, and it’d be a crying shame to nix crackers from the the merriment.</p>
      <p>With people’s eco-consciousness growing, however, you’d be forgiven for wanting to be a bit Bah Humbug about the huge amount of needless plastic included.</p>
      <p>From plastic in the cracker’s outer to the pointless toys that just get thrown away (has anyone ever used those plastic pinging frogs after 25 December?), it’s all a bit wasteful.</p>
      <p>You don’t need to go full killjoy to keep things sustainable, though. There are loads of different options for you right on the UK high street and web.</p>

      <p>Both the crackers themselves and the box for these are made from cardboard, which is easily recycled.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Not only that, the gifts are all made from silver or cardboard (except from a plastic cookie cutter which you can use for ages).</p>
      <p>You could bag yourself a silver bowling game, nail clippers, silver money clip, snap hook, bottle opener, nail file, silver dice, silver whistle, cookie mould, silver notebook, magic trick, or playing cards.</p>
      <p>Get them <a href="https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/waitrose-christmas-holly-crackers/542378-704995-704996?">here</a>. £7 for a pack of 12.</p>

      <p>These crackers have a selection FSC certified tree decorations and are plastic free, so you can impress any eco-conscious guests.</p>
      <p>You’ll get hats and jokes as usual – as well as the all-important snap – but instead of toys and games you’ll find gorgeous tree decorations.</p>
      <p>They’re not suitable for children, but children would probably not appreciate the aesthetic, sustainable gifts anyway.</p>
      <p>They also come in a paper bag, so when you’re done you just sweep the crackers into the bag and pop straight into the recycling.</p>
      <p>Get them <a href="https://www.lovetiki.com/product/plastic-free-christmas-cracker-12pk-copy/?">here</a>. £16.79 for 12.</p>

      <p>There are foil accents on these adorable crackers, so you will have to be careful when recycling.</p>
      <p>However, the real standout is the gifts inside, which are all wildlife themed keyrings.</p>
      <p>The wooden keepsakes are genuinely pretty and usable, so you know they won’t end up in the bin.</p>

      <p>For something a little bit different, try Keepthiscracker.</p>

      <p>They bang when you pull them but don’t tear open, so no waste. As well as this, they come in paper packaging, and even the ribbons are made 100% used plastic bottles sourced from Europe.</p>
      <p>When you do eventually get new ones, they can be recycled as you would any cardboard.</p>

      <p>Aren’t these sprout designs cute?</p>
      <p>The gifts inside these bespoke crackers are also amazing. You can get wooden golf tees, a wooden honey drizzler, a mini whisk, a large wooden die, an egg cup, a salt scoop, a nutmeg grater and mini pencils, mini strawberry jam, luxury tea or wild flower seeds. Dibs on the cute, tiny jam.</p>
      <p>Everything’s recyclable except the bows (which you can use for crafting) and the box doesn’t have that annoying plastic window in it, which is even better.</p>
