      <h1>Pokémon Sword &amp; Shield are the fastest-selling games in Switch's history</h1>
      <h2>Switch duo sells six million copies worldwide in first week of release</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1570" target="_blank">James Batchelor</a></address>
      <p>The Pokémon Company has revealed that Sword and Shield smashed Switch records in its first seven days.</p>
      <p>After one week on sale, the two games have <a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1197447168304537600">sold a combined six million copies</a> around the globe, making them the console's fastest-selling games to date.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-20-pokemon-sword-and-shield-sold-1-36m-retail-copies-in-three-days-in-japan">1.36 million of these were sold in Pokémon's home territory of Japan</a> -- and that was just within the first three days. It's the best opening week for a Nintendo Switch title in the region to date.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a Nintendo of America announcement reveals they sold over two million copies in the first two days in the US.</p>
      <p>Sword and Shield enjoyed the series' <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-17-uk-charts-pok-mon-sword-and-shield-post-huge-opening-weekend-sales">second biggest launch ever in the UK</a>, unable to quite surpass the success of Sun and Moon (in part due to the 3DS having a larger install base, and those games launching two days earlier).</p>
      <p>However, retail data shared with <i>GamesIndustry.biz</i> showed that the launch triggered a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-19-nintendo-switch-uk-sales-spike-30-percent-as-pok-mon-sword-and-shield-sets-record">30% spike in Switch hardware sales</a> -- although not the special edition Sword &amp; Shield model.</p>
      <p>To date, the core entries of the Pokémon RPG series have sold more than 240 million copies worldwide.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Correction: An earlier version of this article reported Sword &amp; Shield were the fastest-selling games in the Pokémon series' history, not Switch as the story should have stated.</i>
