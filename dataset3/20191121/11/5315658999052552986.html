      <p>In the year ended June 2019:<br/>• General government net operating balance reached a $10.9 billion surplus. <br/>• Total operating income increased 7.9 percent, led by a strong tax revenue increase. <br/>• The main drivers for tax revenue growth were strong increases to taxes in income (up 9.8 percent) and taxes on good and services (up 6.2 percent). <br/>• Total operating expenditure increased 6.9 percent as social benefits, employee expenses, and purchases of goods and services rose. <br/>• Net acquisition of non-financial assets increased $0.4 billion to $6.0 billion. <br/>• Net lending was $4.9 billion. <br/>• Net worth was $345.7 billion at 30 June 2019, which was a strong increase from 2018. <br/>• Net debt was $28.5 billion, down $2.0 billion from 2018. Although local government net debt has continued to increase, this was offset by the decrease in central government net debt which has been declining since 2016.</p>
