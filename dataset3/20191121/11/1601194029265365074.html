      <p>It certainly has been a chaotic road to this Sunday’s <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/wwe-survivor-series">Survivor Series</a> PPV, with WWE <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">NXT</a> at the center of this year’s battle for brand supremacy.</p>
      <p>The Black &amp; Gold brand is on the verge of the biggest weekend in its history, as one night before Survivor Series, they also go to war at NXT Takeover: WarGames.</p>
      <p>The build to that event has revolved a lot around the women of NXT, showcasing why the division is regarded as one of the best in all of wrestling. In the midst of that, one lady has taken the chance she’s been presented and grasped it with both hands. That Superstar is Kay Lee Ray.</p>
      <p>The NXT UK Women’s Champion made a surprise appearance at the end of last week’s NXT, revealing herself as the final member of Team Shayna at WarGames. The Scot followed that up this week with an impressive win over Dakota Kai, before getting herself in the thick of the Survivor Series warfare.</p>
      <p>It became evident afterward that her performance didn’t go unnoticed, and one person in particular who watched was Bayley. The SmackDown Women’s Champion was the first to question why Kay Lee was matchless on Sunday</p>

      <p>Why is the NXT UK roster not represented? WWE (particularly Triple H) has put in a lot of effort to establish the UK brand as a major player, as The Game has taken a hands-on approach with TV tapings and TakeOver events, and regularly references NXT UK on his media calls.</p>
      <p>The likes of WALTER, Pete Dunne, and Tyler Bate have been frequent figures on the mainstream NXT show, and have looked strong on many occasions.</p>
      <p>However, when it comes to the main roster shows, it’s not been presented in the same way. This was shown during the Manchester tapings when Imperium had minimum involvement and former NXT UK Tag Champions Mark Andrews and Flash Morgan Webster were comprehensively beaten.</p>
      <p>Survivor Series presents the best opportunity to right this wrong, and Kay Lee is the perfect wrestler to do this. She is extremely talented in the ring, and her work across the UK in the likes of ICW and Pro Wrestling: EVE has proven this tenfold.</p>
      <p>Many WWE fans in the US won’t have seen much of the Superstar aside from her early exit from the Mae Young Classic, and her recent NXT appearances. If given a chance against the likes of Becky Lynch and Shayna Baszler, she will only elevate what already looks to be a show-stealing affair.</p>
      <p>Although Bayley is the one teasing, I would personally love to see Kay Lee and Becky face off. The Queen of Insanity vs The Man, please take my money!</p>
