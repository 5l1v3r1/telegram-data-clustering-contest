      <h3>Apple could be making an iTunes successor specifically for Windows</h3>

      <p>After killing off iTunes for macOS, Apple could be looking to do the same for Windows. The company has posted a job listing seeking a senior software engineer to work on Windows media apps, fuelling speculation that an iTunes successor could be in the works.</p>
      <p>While the job ad doesn't give too much away, it does give a tantalizing glimpse into the future. In the listing, Apple says: "The Media Apps team is looking for a creative senior software engineer to work on the next generation of media apps for Windows. You will help build innovative features that will delight millions of customers around the world."</p>

      <p>Neowin noticed the job posted on LinkedIn, but it can also be seen on the Apple site. In the qualification requirements, Apple says that "experience with UWP is a big plus".</p>
      <p>The apparent embracing of UWP (Universal Windows Platform) means that Apple could well be looking to create a modern follow-up to iTunes that could be used not only on Windows 10 computers, but also on Xbox One consoles and other devices.</p>
      <h4>Work for Apple</h4>
      <p>Apple doesn't mention iTunes by name in the ad, but as the suggestion that the job will appeal "if you love music and you are passionate about writing code" is a pretty strong indication as to what's in store.</p>
      <p>Having split iTunes up into three separate apps – Apple Music, Apple TV, Books and Podcasts – in macOS Catalina, many people thought it a little strange that the app so many people love to hate lived on in Windows 10. Is iTunes finally getting the chop for Windows users? Time will tell.</p>
