      <h1>Congress says ‘complete unanimity’ with NCP, to meet pre-poll allies, Shiv Sena tomorrow</h1>
      <h2>The briefing on the composition of the government and the architecture will happen after this, says Prithviraj Chavan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:37:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sandeep-Phukan-11373/" target="_blank">Sandeep Phukan</a></address>
      <p>Congress leader and former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan said on November 21 that discussions between the NCP and his party were over and that there was “complete unanimity”.</p>
      <p>Both the parties will meet pre-poll allies in Mumbai on November 22, and then the Shiv Sena. The briefing on the composition of the government and the architecture would happen after this, he said.</p>
      <p>Top Congress leaders and core members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) met on Thursday at party chief Sonia Gandhi’s residence over the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ncp-shiv-sena-and-congress-work-out-draft-common-minimum-programme/article29975549.ece">Common Minimum Programme </a>(CMP) to support a Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, <i>The Hindu</i> reported how the use of the word “secularism” was proving tricky for the parties to come to an agreement.</p>

      <p>Sources claimed that the Congress was insisting on the inclusion of ‘secularism’ in the CMP, while the Sena does not want it so.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar is learnt to have suggested that the CMP could simply refer to abiding by the Preamble of the Constitution without explicitly mentioning it.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday’s [Wednesday] meeting was on CMP and leaders of the NCP and the Congress have said the deliberations were positive. In a day or two, the three parties will reach a consensus. Maharashtra will get a stable government led by the Shiv Sena before December,” Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters.</p>
      <p>The formulation on secularism is going to be a crucial one for the Congress as one of its allies in Kerala, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), met Ms. Gandhi over the possible tie-up with the Sena.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, for the first time, the Congress-NCP alliance said that they in-principle agreed to be part of a Sena-led alliance.</p>
