      <h1>Super Lig side to target Norwich City’s Teemu Pukki, official sent last week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T11:33:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/nihat-emre-kocaaslan/" target="_blank">Nihat Emre Kocaaslan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fotomac.com.tr/">Fotomac</a> claim Fenerbahce assistant Volkan Demirel watched Norwich City striker Teemu Pukki in action against Greece last week and was left impressed with what he saw from the Finland international.</p>
      <p>Pukki made an excellent start to the Premier League campaign with Daniel Farke’s side but his form has slipped recently, just like that of his team.</p>
      <p>However, Fotomac report Fenerbahce are interested in signing the 29 year old and that they’ve added him to their shortlist ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to Fotomac, the former Celtic striker could partner Vedat Muriqi in the second half of the season, and Fener will begin their operation to sign the Finn next month.</p>
      <p>Despite the Super Lig side’s interest in the attacker it’s unlikely Norwich City will want to lose a key player midway through the season.</p>

      <p>Pukki’s last Premier League goal came in the mid-September victory against Manchester City and he’s not scored in the last seven games.</p>
      <p>His contract at Carrow Road will expire at the end of June 2022.</p>
