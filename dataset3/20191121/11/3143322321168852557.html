      <h2>Every year, World Antibiotic Awareness Week (WAAW) is celebrated by governments, health facilities, schools and communities across the globe. The campaign highlights best practices among the general public, health workers and policy makers to help stop the further emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.</h2>

      <p>According to the World Health Organisation, this week takes place every November to promote global education on antibiotics, how they should be used, and the growing risks of antibiotic resistance. But for now, global awareness of all these issues remains relatively low.</p>
      <p>This year it is being observed from November 18 to 24 and aims to highlight the best practices among the general public, health workers and policymakers to help stop the further emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.</p>

      <p>According to the South African Department of Health, antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to global health today.</p>
      <blockquote>“It is rising to dangerously high levels in all parts of the world. It is compromising our ability to treat infectious diseases and putting people everywhere at risk.”</blockquote>
      <p>Working together, we can ensure antibiotics are used only when necessary and as prescribed. Antibiotics are a precious resource that we cannot continue to take for granted—we need to handle them with care.</p>
      <p>How do bacteria become <b>resistant to antibiotics? </b></p>

      <p>Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change in some way that reduces or eliminates the effectiveness of drugs, chemicals, or other agents designed to cure or prevent infections. The bacteria survive and continue to multiply causing more harm.</p>
      <p>WebMD suggests that to help fight antibiotic resistance and protect yourself against infection, the following steps can be taken:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Don’t take antibiotics unless you’re certain you need them.</b>
        </li>
        <li/>
        <li> An estimated 30% of the millions of prescriptions written each year are not needed. Always ask your doctor if antibiotics will really help. For illnesses caused by viruses: common colds, bronchitis,  and many ear and sinus infections — they won’t.</li>
        <li/>
        <li><b>Finish your pills</b>.</li>
        <li>

          </figure>
        </li>
        <li>Take your entire prescription exactly as directed. Do it even if you start feeling better. If you stop before the infection is completely wiped out, those bacteria are more likely to become drug-resistant.</li>
        <li/>
        <li><b>Get vaccinated</b>.</li>

        <li/>
        <li>Immunizations can protect you against some diseases that are treated with antibiotics. They include tetanus and whooping cough.</li>
        <li/>
        <li>
          <b>Stay safe in the hospital.</b>
        </li>
        <li/>
        <li>Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are commonly found in hospitals. Make sure your caregivers wash their hands properly. Also, ask how to keep surgical wounds free of infection.</li>
