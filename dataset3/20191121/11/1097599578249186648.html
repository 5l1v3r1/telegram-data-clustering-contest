        <b>Fethard 2-17 Aherlow 6-2</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fethard made it three U-19 A titles in-a-row last weekend as they brought the Tipperary LGFA season to a close with a three-point victory over Aherlow in Sean Treacy Park, Tipperary town, on Saturday afternoon last November 16.</p>
      <p>On a cold but dry afternoon, spectators were treated to an eight-goal feast. Aherlow were forced to field without Anna Rose Kennedy, who picked up an injury during the week. However  Fethard were on top from the throw-in and dominated the first 20 minutes to lead by 1-6 to 1-0 but Aherlow scored 3-1 before half time to go to the break 0-2 ahead, Aherlow 4-1 to Fethard 1-8.</p>
      <p>Aherlow started the second half as they finished the first with yet another goal and a point to go 6 points ahead with 20 minutes left and looked to be in control of the game. </p>
      <p>However the Fethard girls refused to accept defeat and upped their game and went at the Aherlow defence in waves, chipping away at the lead with some excellent points  and a goal to go 0-3  in front. As the game entered the final minute, Aherlow mounted one last attack in search of an equalising goal but the Fethard defence stood firm and were winners by three points at the finish.</p>
      <p>Captain Muireann O’Connell accepted  the John Donovan Cup on behalf of a jubilant Fethard team who have now completed three in- a-row of U-19 A championship wins. Midfielder Alison Connolly received the player of the match award.</p>
