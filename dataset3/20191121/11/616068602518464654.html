      <p>Penticton RCMP say they will be keeping an eye on a review in Kelowna looking into high numbers of police-deemed 'unfounded' sex assaults. </p>
      <p>Recent Stats Canada results show in 2018 Penticton RCMP received <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/269999/women-suffering-in-silence">29 reports of sexual related offences</a>, 11 of which were deemed unfounded, a police term that means "when a criminal offence has been reported and a police investigation has determined that the offence has not occurred or been attempted."</p>
      <p>Kelowna RCMP also has <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270175/unfounded-cases-reviewed">high numbers</a> which are currently being officially reviewed. </p>
      <p>"Although we are not in a position to discuss specific cases, we assure the general public that we take these reports very seriously and remain accountable for our investigations," reads a release from Penticton RCMP Thursday. </p>
      <p>"We recognize that sexual crimes can be a life altering event, and we continue to encourage survivors of sexual assault to report these crimes to police ... Penticton RCMP is monitoring and will pay close attention to the results of the review underway in Kelowna for any trends that may apply."</p>
