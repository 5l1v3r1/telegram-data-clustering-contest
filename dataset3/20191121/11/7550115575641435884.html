        <b>Liverpool announced a fan meeting for the expansion of the Anfield Road end, on the same morning that many experienced difficulty buying tickets.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Frustration with the club’s ticket sale system for members is a common occurrence throughout the season.</p>
      <p>The latest wave of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/premier-league">Premier League</a> tickets were made available this week, with the initial members’ sale on Tuesday being for the clashes with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-united">Man United</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/west-ham">West Ham</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/burnley">Burnley</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a>.</p>
      <p>To purchase tickets for those, members required a record of at least 13 home games attended last season to purchase, with this reduced to four for the meetings with United and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/chelsea">Chelsea</a> from Wednesday.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, all members were able to buy tickets for the fixtures against Sheffield United, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/west-ham">West Ham</a>, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, Palace, Aston Villa and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/burnley">Burnley</a>.</p>
      <p>This tiered system has long sparked issues with fans, who are often forced to wait in online queues for hours, on a weekday, with no guarantee of tickets as the club confirm they are sold on a “first come, first served basis.”</p>

      <p>And with Liverpool <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/373905-residents-invited-to-consultation-on-proposed-anfield-road-expansion">announcing</a> a fan consultation over their plans for the expansion of the Anfield Road end on Thursday morning, complaints on Twitter were prominent:</p>

      <p>There is, of course, an argument that expanding Anfield will aid problems with supporters aiming to buy tickets, with the club’s current plan being to increase capacity to over 60,000.</p>
      <p>But given many fans’ issue is with new memberships being as valid as long-serving, match-going memberships for certain games—such as Sheffield United and Villa—this may only exacerbate the issue.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it should be noted that regardless of the fairness of the members’ system, the same tickets are then being sold on third-party websites immediately after:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It is a difficult process which the club have seemingly attempted to solve with the Fan Update scheme <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/368667-fan-update-now-live-for-liverpool-fc-official-members">introduced</a> last month.</p>
      <p>Liverpool explained that this aimed to “help supporters who currently have more than one official membership or season ticket to clarify who uses the tickets going forward.”</p>
      <p>But the regularity with these complaints highlights a big issue, though addressing this is not the intention of the club’s <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/373905-residents-invited-to-consultation-on-proposed-anfield-road-expansion">Anfield Road end consultation</a>, which will be held at The Kop Bar on Nov 29, Dec 2 and Dec 3.</p>
