        <b>Preston North End’s visit to Pride Park to take on Derby County in September 2006 certainly had an edge to it.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The clash reunited the Lilywhites with Billy Davies, the manager who had departed Deepdale three months earlier to take the Derby job.</p>

      <p>Davies had been followed to the Rams by six members of his backroom staff, it being the nature of their exit which had left a bad taste.</p>
      <p>PNE chairman of the time Derek Shaw refused to sit with the Derby directors, choosing instead to watch the 1-1 draw from the press box.</p>
      <p>Down on the touchline, Davies took plenty of stick from many of the 1,600 North End fans in the away end.</p>
      <p>Briefly, the Scotsman’s new charges were ahead in the Championship contest through Steven Howard’s 44th minute goal.</p>

      <p>But by half-time Danny Pugh had pulled Preston level and that proved sufficient for them to take a point back to Lancashire.</p>
      <p>Paul Simpson had been the man brought in to replace Davies, recruited from Carlisle.</p>
      <p>Their pair stood a few yards away from one another on the touchline and it was Simpson who left the ground the happier of the pair.</p>
      <p>Preston’s matchday squad contained 10 players signed by Davies, with him shaking all of them by the hand in the pre-match warm-up.</p>
      <p>This wasn’t the best game of football in the world, the focus more on Davies than what happened on the pitch.</p>
      <p>North End had headed there following back-to-back home wins over Cardiff and West Bromwich Albion.</p>
      <p>David Nugent, back in the squad after suspension, had to make do with a place on the bench.</p>
      <p>Patrick Agyemang and Danny Dichio were preferred up front, the former after scoring a superb overhead kick against Albion.</p>
      <p>Nugent was to get off the bench before half-time though, when Dichio suffered a deadleg.</p>
      <p>The best of the action was squeezed into a short spell in the run-up to half-time.</p>
      <p>Derby nosed in front when Arsenal loanee Arturo Lupoli was brought down in the box by Sean St Ledger, referee Graham Laws pointing to the penalty spot.</p>
      <p>Howard stepped up to send Preston keeper Carlo Nash the wrong way with the penalty.</p>
      <p>Davies punched the air with delight on the touchline but his joy was relatively shortlived.</p>
      <p>North End equalised in first-half stoppage time. Chris Sedgwick sent a cross into the box which was cleared by the Derby defence.</p>
      <p>The ball fell to Pugh two yards outside the box who made himself a bit of room before curling a right-foot finish past Rams goalkeeper Stephen Bywater into the far corner of the net.</p>
      <p>North End had plenty of defending to do in the second half but held out.</p>
      <p>There were a couple of scares along the way, Nash saving well with his legs from Lupoli in the 50th minute.</p>
      <p>Six minutes from time, a header from Howard came back off the bar and bounced down in the PNE goalmouth before being hoofed clear.</p>
      <p>At the final whistle, Davies and Simpson shook hands, with Preston boss Simpson saying he had no axe to grind with his predecessor.</p>
      <p>His beef was more with the backroom staff who had chosen to follow Davies a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>Said Simpson: “I haven’t got a problem with Billy Davies – it wasn’t him who walked out after two days of pre-season training.”</p>
