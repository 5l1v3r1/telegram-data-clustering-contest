      <p>Aspiring croupiers, cocktail bartenders and even butlers will be trained to compete with the world’s best at Sydney’s newest hospitality training college when it opens in March.</p>
      <p>Crown College International group general manager Shane Thomas said Sydney could not rest on its laurels because Asian cities had superior hospitality personnel.</p>
      <p>“I think the industry could do more, the industry is now competing with Macao,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Up until 10 years ago Macao was just a couple of casinos, now it is huge.”</p>
      <p>Crown College will open in Sydney by July 2020 to train staff in all things from wine tasting to how to make coffee to leadership courses.</p>
      <p>He said there was huge demand for jobs including highly trained chefs who could make good money.</p>
      <p>While Crown College will train regular bar staff and croupiers, it will also seek out a select few to become butlers for its VIP guests.</p>

      <p>“(They would need) years of experience, butlers are a sought after position,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They would come with that ultimate customer service experience and within that we might do wine training, we might do cocktail training, we might do coffee training, we might do sommelier service.”</p>
      <p>Mr Thomas said shows like Masterchef had inspired young people to get into hospitality but we need to change the perception around it.</p>
      <p>“Australia is changing, new hotels, new venues, new styles of food and shows like Masterchef make people think ‘I can be 23 years of age and opening and running my own restaurant’.”</p>
      <p>“It is a competitive market in Sydney, you’re spoiled for choice for high end restaurants and they’re all competing for qualified staff and well trained staff.”</p>
