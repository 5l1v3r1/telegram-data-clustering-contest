      <h1>New tech puts virtual sense of touch at our fingertip</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:09:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Garrett Anderson has never known the pleasure of holding hands with both his children at the same time.</p>
      <p>While deployed in Iraq with the US army in 2005, a bomb blast shot shrapnel through his right arm, severing it just below the elbow.</p>
      <p>Today, the Illinois-based retired veteran wears a prosthetic which allows him to pick up objects and have basic mobility.</p>
      <p>But it cannot duplicate the sense of touch.</p>
      <p>A new second-skin “virtual reality” technology — designed to work with both prosthetics and gaming applications —  may change that.</p>
      <p>The system, developed by researchers at Northwestern University and described in the journal Nature, incorporates 32 individually programmable actuators — a device that emits electric impulses or vibrations — which are embedded into a pliable material made from silicone that adheres to the skin.</p>
      <p>Controlled by a wireless touchscreen such as a smartphone or tablet, each actuator — the size of a small coin — vibrates to create the perception of touch. The user can control the pressure and the pattern of the sensation.</p>

      <p>Anderson tried the system, integrated with his prosthetic. While wearing a patch on his skin, he could feel sensations from his prosthetic fingertips transmitted to his arm.</p>
      <p>Over time, the brain converts that sensation to what researcher John Rogers describes as a “surrogate sense of feeling”.</p>
      <p>The authors say the device could also be used for social interactions, offering a stroke of an arm to a loved one during a video call, or a pat of encouragement to a teammate during a virtual game.</p>
      <p>“Our sense of touch provides the most profound, deepest, emotional connection between people,” Rogers said in a statement.</p>
      <p>In the study, published Wednesday, the authors described a scenario in which a young girl touches her grandmother’s hand during a video call.</p>
      <p>“We are interested in fine touch — a finger stroke across the arm or shoulder, or a pattern of sensation that can reproduce a surrogate of touch,” Rogers told AFP.</p>
      <p>The device is wireless and does not require battery power. It uses the same near-field communication protocols found in smartphone banking applications, such as Apple Pay.</p>
      <p>“With this wireless power delivery scheme, we completely avoid the need for batteries, with their weight, size, bulk and limited operating lifetimes,” Rogers said. “The result is a thin, lightweight system that can be worn and used without constraint, indefinitely.”</p>
      <p>For Anderson, the technology may finally allow him to simultaneously clasp the hands of his children, aged 13 and 10.</p>
      <p>But it will also have practical applications, such as being able to sense how much force he’s applying when gripping a fragile object or touching someone.</p>

      <p>“I remember when I was first injured, I grabbed my mom’s hand and almost broke it because I did not know the amount of pressure I was using,” Anderson told AFP.</p>
      <p>Rogers said his aim is to improve quality of life, and that working with Anderson was “a deeply moving experience.”</p>
      <p>The prototype is only a first attempt, and researchers are working to make the device lighter and slimmer.</p>
      <p>In the future, they would also like to explore thermal inputs, which will allow someone with a prosthetic hand to feel how hot or cold a drink is.</p>
      <p>“When I explain to others how it works they are floored by what people are able to develop,” Anderson said.</p>
