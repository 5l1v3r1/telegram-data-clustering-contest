      <p>T-Mobile says it has <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-data-breach-prepaid-customers/">suffered a data breach affecting some prepaid customers</a>. No financial data, social security numbers, or passwords were accessed, but information associated with users' prepaid wireless accounts was obtained, including names, billing addresses, phone numbers, account numbers, rate plans, and features that users have added to their accounts. TmoNews reports: <i>T-Mobile is in the process of notifying all customers that've been affected by this data breach. If you got a notification, you should update the PIN on your T-Mobile account. T-Mo does say that it's possible that some affected customers may not be notified because their contact info isn't up-to-date, so if that's the case with you, you can contact T-Mobile support for more info by dialing 611 from your T-Mo phone or 1-800-TMOBILE from any phone. There's no word yet on exactly how many customers were affected by this security issue, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/dzmyqa/new_scam_or_real_issue/">some Reddit users</a> have chimed in to say that they've been alerted to the breach by T-Mobile. </i>"We take the security of your information very seriously and have a number of safeguards in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access," T-Mobile says. "We truly regret that this incident occurred and apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you."</p>
