      <p>In one of the funniest instances in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma">MMA</a> world recently, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/darren-till">Darren Till</a> did something that he admittedly regrets on a drunken night. If you remember his post-fight press conference following UFC 244, Till seemed to steer clear of a fight against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/yoel-romero">Yoel Romero</a>.</p>
      <p>However, not too long after, he posted a picture of Romero on social media and called for a fight against him - only for the post to blow up and go viral.</p>
      <p>When speaking to <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYnd41Pd5o">MMAUK</a></i><i> </i>(H/T Credits <i><a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/darren-till-says-he-called-out-yoel-romero-when-he-was-blind-drunk">BJPenn.com</a></i>), Till revealed that his call-out of Romero happened on a night where he was "blind drunk". He said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I was blind drunk. Yes, so my friend opened up a great bar in Liverpool, we got invited to the opening and I was celebrating the win. I was with the guys and I said, I had a few beers and said, ‘watch this.’ So, I went onto Google, I’ll get an image of Yoel, cause he is a scary dude, I said I’ll post that. He was like really bro? I said why not, let’s start a little controversy. So, I tagged him let’s go and it just blew up.”</blockquote>
      <p>He said that he only realized what had happened the morning after, but admitted that his social media tirades are nothing serious and are all fun:</p>
      <blockquote>“I remember the next morning I woke up and my girl was sat on the couch, because I slept on the couch, and she was like you called Yoel out. So, I went onto Google and got the monkey eyes and told my guy to add when you wake up and realize you called out Yoel. Everyone knows when I’m going on a tirade on Twitter it is because I’m having a drink. It is never normal. I’m having fun.”</blockquote>
      <p>Darren Till has since backtracked from his call-out with a couple of memes on social media.</p>
      <p>Till has, however, called out a man who has beaten Romero twice - Robert Whittaker. UFC is set to return to London around March or April of 2020 and Whittaker responded to <i>The Gorilla</i>, accepting the challenge.</p>

      <p>As for Romero, he's expected to challenge Israel Adesanya for the UFC Middleweight Championship despite being on a 2-fight losing skid and having lost 3 out of his last 4. This is, of course, upon the champion's request after Paulo Costa was revealed to be out for a while with an injury.</p>
