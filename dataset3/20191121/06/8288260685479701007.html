      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Layton, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/josh-layton/</a></address>
      <p>A giant emporium of booze and ball games is coming to Digbeth in time for the Christmas party season.</p>
      <p>Roxy Ball Room will bring pool, ping pong, shuffleboard, beer pong and 10 full-sized bowling lanes to Birmingham as the city spills out for the festive season.</p>
      <p>Keeping the action flowing from the afternoon until late in the night, the social gaming concept has already proved popular at venues in Manchester, Nottingham, Liverpool and Leeds.</p>
      <p>The first Roxy Ball Room in Birmingham will launch in mid-December across the huge open planned ground floor. A large part of the floorspace will be taken up by the bowling lanes and there will be a number of mezzanines bathed in glowing lights.</p>

      <p>Festive revellers will be able to slide pucks down full-sized shuffleboard tables and try out Roxy’s signature cocktails, including the Ping Star Martini.</p>
      <p>Private bookings, including tailored Christmas parties with drinks packages, will also be available when the house of balls and beer opens in Heath Mill Lane.</p>
      <p>Situated between Birdies Bar and Drop Shot Digbeth, it’s shaping up to bring something completely fresh to Digbeth, Birmingham’s burgeoning creative quarter.</p>

      <h3>What’s on offer?  </h3>
      <p>Social gaming will be on offer at every turn – with craft beer and cocktails within arm’s reach.</p>
      <p>Ping pong tables will be Olympic-standard, high-performance models from leading manufacturer Butterfly, who make professional equipment for the sport’s elite level.</p>
      <p>Shuffleboard, played with weighted pucks on smooth, full-sized tables, will also be part of the social sports. Though the game has been popular in America it’s said to have originated in Tudor Britain during Henry VIII’s reign, and has been making a welcome return to British pubs.</p>

      <p>Teams compete to get their pucks closest to the edge at the end of a counter - a bit like table-top curling on wood. All of the finely crafted boards are made by Shufl, the UK’s leading brand. Roxy Ballers will also be able to compete on American pool tables made by premier manufacturer Sam Leisure. With an indie and rock soundtrack, the wall-to-wall thrills and spills are completed by a fully-decked bar and beer and Prosecco pong battle stations. American-style food and drink will include a full stone-baked pizza menu. There are also sides, nibbles and sharers. Craft beers will include at least two local varieties among the drops available on draught and in bottles, and there’s a full cocktail menu.</p>
