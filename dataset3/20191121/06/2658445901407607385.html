          <b>Worried by the violence, ballot box snatching and bloodshed that have come to characterise elections in the country, the Senate has initiated fresh moves to address these challenges through a rejig of the Electoral Act, GBADE OGUNWALE reports</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The consensus opinion among key political stakeholders and the informed public is that until the nation gets its electoral process right, elections in the country will continue to record needless human casualties. The sanctity of the ballot, credibility of the electoral process and the integrity of the electoral umpire, have come under intense debate since the present democratic journey began in 1999.</p>
      <p>With six general election cycles down the line, little progress has been recorded in terms of electoral reforms. For the first 16 consecutive years (1999-2015) that it held power at the centre, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) failed to entrench a workable electoral process in the country.</p>
      <p>For the eight years (1999-2007) in the leadership saddle, former President Olusegun Obasanjo failed to initiate any concrete reforms to the delinquent electoral process he inherited from the preceding military regime. Rather, Obasanjo and his PDP chose to progress in error, devising unconventional means to win elections to the chagrin of the opposition parties.</p>
      <p>The first general elections conducted under the Obasanjo Presidency in 2003 did very little to the credibility of the electoral process. Having secured reelection through a flawed process, the former President saw no need to fix the gaping holes in the electoral process. Buoyed by the gains his party recorded in that poll, Obasanjo went ahead to conduct the 2007 elections with greater opportunistic fervour. Through that brigand election, he was able to instal a hand picked successor, the late Umaru Musa Yar ‘Adua.</p>
      <p>However, in a departure from Obasanjo’s vainglorious gloating over his party’s “landslide victory”, Yar ‘Adua, on assumption of office, publicly admitted that the election that brought him in, was indeed flawed. Yar ‘Adua had promised to initiate the necessary electoral reforms that would preserve the credibility of subsequent elections in the country.</p>
      <p>The then General Muhammadu Buhari, who contested the election on the platform of the defunct All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP), had challenged the outcome of the election up to the Supreme Court. Although the apex court did not reverse the victory of the PDP at the presidential level, the various divisions of the Court of Appeal upturned the victory of the PDP in the governorship category in a number of states. Some of the affected statesman were Ekiti, Ondo, Osun, Edo and Anambra states. That accounts for the off season governorship elections in those states.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Uwais committee report</b>
      </p>
      <p>True to his word, Yar ‘Adua had, in August 2007, set up a 22-member Electoral Reform Committee chaired by a former Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Muhammadu Uwais. Far reaching recommendations were made by the committee in its report submitted in December 2008. Some of the highlights of the recommendations required the President to cede the power of appointment of the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to the judiciary. It also made request for the establishment of Electoral Offences Commission to deal with cases of electoral offences. Yar ‘Adua had in 2009, forwarded an edited version of the report to the National Assembly for consideration, but rejected the request to cede the power of appointment of the INEC chair to the judiciary. Upon</p>
      <p>Yar ‘Adua’s death and on assumption of office as President, Jonathan had sent the full report to the lawmakers for consideration in amendment to the constitution. But the lawmakers had similarly rejected the request to allow the judiciary appoint the INEC chairman. In its appraisal of the electoral process in Nigeria, the committee, among others, observed the existence of weak democratic institutions and processes. It also pinned the violent and disruptions in elections to negative political culture, weak legal framework, lack of independence and capacity of the electoral management bodies.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fresh attempt by the Ninth Senate</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Ninth Senate has also listed 13 items and various Sections of the Electoral Act for amendment. The items are contained in Order Paper, an in-house publication of the Senate. The draft emanated from the office of the Deputy President of the Senate, Ovie Omo-Agege, who incidentally is the chairman of the Constitution Review Panel of the two chambers of the National Assembly. The media office of the Deputy President of the Senate said the planned amendments to the Sections would be carried out in good time before the next election cycle. The envisaged amendments covered pre election, election day and post election phases.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h3>The proposed amendments</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Pre election: Conditions for INEC staffing</b>
      </p>
      <p>Section 8 (5) of the Electoral Act which concerns staffing into the commission mandates a person who is a member of a political party and seeks employment into the commission to disclose their partisanship. Failure to do so, attracts minimum of five years, a fine of N5 million or both.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Charges on nominees by political parties</b>
      </p>
      <p>Section 87 of the Principal Act is changed to allow the inclusion of total fees imposed by a political party on an aspirant not to exceed a stipulated amount for the purpose of nomination of candidates for election.</p>
      <p>N150,000 for a Ward Councillorship aspirant in the FCT, N250,000 for an Area Council Chairmanship aspirant in the FCT, N500,000 for a House of Assembly aspirant, One Million Naira for a House of Representatives aspirant, Two Million Naira (N2,000,000) for a Senatorial aspirant, Five Million naira for a Governorship aspirant and Ten Million Naira for a Presidential aspirant.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>National register of voters and voters’ registration</b>
      </p>
      <p>Section 9 of the principal act was amended to include a subsection (1a) for INEC to keep both documents in manual and electronic formats in its National Headquarters and other locations according to its discretion.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Procedure of displaying voters’ register</b>
      </p>
      <p>Section 19 (1) changes the timing in which the commission is expected to display a copy for each Local Government, Area Councilor ward from  a period of not less than 5 days and not exceeding 14 days to not later than 30 days to a general election, appoint a period of 7 days and on its official website or any website established by the Commission for that purpose.</p>
      <p>Noncompliance to this provision attracts imprisonment for a minimum term of 6 months or a minimum fine of N100,000.</p>
      <p>After displaying the documents, an introduced subsection (1A) mandates the Commission to accept and rectify complaints in the voters’ register within 14 days of publishing the register.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Death of a candidate before declaration of result</b>
      </p>
      <p>Section 36 of the Principal Act makes provision for the death of a candidate before the announcement of the final result.</p>
      <p>The new bill inserts a new subsection (3) to allow INEC to suspend the election for a period not exceeding 21 days while the political party whose candidate died, if it intends to continue to participate in the election, conduct a fresh primary within 14 days of the death of its candidate and submit the name of a new candidate to the Commission.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Election day: Video inspection of electoral materials</b>
      </p>
      <p>Before the commencement of election in a polling unit, a new subsection (4A) in Section 43 of the Principal Act allows accredited electoral official to inspect original electoral materials through writing or video recording and noncompliance results to a minimum imprisonment term of one year or a minimum fine of N1 million or both. Also, 20 days before the elections, political parties shall be invited by the commission to inspect it’s identity in electoral materials while the party shall respond within two days on it’s approval or disapproval of the inspection. Non-appearance of party after invitation signifies acceptance.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Smart card reader for accreditation</b>
      </p>
      <p>A new provision in Section 41 allows the use of Smart Card Reader or any other technological device for accreditation of voters.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Electronic transmission of voter accreditation</b>
      </p>
      <p>Also in Section 41, Presiding officers are mandated to transmit the voter accreditation data by secured mobile electronic communication to the collation center to which the polling unit belongs in the constituency and central database of the Commission kept at the National Headquarter of the Commission. If there is a breach in the above provision, the election in the polling unit can be  invalidated by a Tribunal or Court and the Presiding Officer shall be liable, on conviction, to a minimum imprisonment for at least 5 years, without an option of fine.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Electronic voting</b>
      </p>
      <p>An amendment was made to Section 52 (2) which prohibits the use of electronic voting machine to empower the Commission by adopting either electronic voting or any other method of voting with its discretion.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Post election: National electronic register of election results</b>
      </p>
      <p>A new subsection in section 65 introduces this register containing database of all election results, which is to be updated continuously, kept by the Commission at its National Headquarter and can be obtained by any person or political party in printed or electronic format upon payment of reasonable fees determined by the Commission.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Period to shut down INEC database</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another provision in Section 41 mandates INEC not to shut down it’s central database containing the data of accreditation of voters and polling unit results for an election until all the election petitions and appeals are heard and determined by a Tribunal or Court.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Issuance of false result</b>
      </p>
      <p>Any official of the Commission or a State Independent Electoral Commission who issues, endorses or certifies a false report or result in respect of an Adhoc Delegates Election or primaries of a Political Party shall be liable on conviction to minimum imprisonment term of five years, without an option of fine.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Post election: Court order on disqualification of winner</b>
      </p>
      <p>In Section 140 (2) of the principal act, once an election is nullified by an election tribunal or court on the ground that the winner was unqualified to contest the election, the court orders a fresh election but an amendment to this section allows the election Tribunal or Court to declare the person with the second highest number of valid votes cast at the election winner if the candidate satisfies the requirements of the Constitution and remains a member of the political party on which platform he contested the election.</p>
      <p>Also, another new subsection in this provision states that if an election was marred by substantial irregularities or non-compliance, the election tribunal or court shall not declare the person with the second highest votes as elected.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Breach of court orders by INEC</b>
      </p>
      <p>Section 151 (3) has been included to sanction the electoral body where it breaches a tribunal or court order to produce, inspect or take copies of electoral materials. The official to whom the order was directed  will be convicted to imprisonment for at least two years without an option of fine.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Clamour for electronic voting</b>
      </p>
      <p>Calls for electronic voting ahead of the 2023 general elections have been strident among prominent individuals and organisations. Electronic voting requires that the entire registration, accreditation, vote counting, collation and announcement chain would be done electronically.</p>
      <p>Twenty years into the democratic journey, the country still operates manual collation, counting and announcement. The only electronic component of the entire process is the smart card reader, which is being used for authentication and accreditation of voters.</p>
      <p>But the general opinion is that electronic voting will go a long way in checking ballot box snatching and disruption of result collation at the various centres. Once the results had been transmitted to the INEC central server at the commission’s headquarters, the ballot papers would no longer be useful for the purpose of altering results. Speaking at a recent convocation ceremony at the University of Ibadan, former INEC chairman, Prof Attahiru Jega called for the strengthening of the nation’s electoral legal framework in order to achieve credible elections and sustainable democratic development. Jega blamed the political class for taking undue advantage of the loopholes and discrepancies in the Electoral Act to abuse the electoral process. Stressing the need to ensure the integrity of the ballot, Jega said, “Africa will be satisfied when there is periodic elections but there must be integrity in the way elections are conducted to achieve sustainable development.</p>
      <p>“It is generally recognised that fortifying democracy is vital to sustainable development, what is not as widely acknowledged is that improving the integrity of elections is key to democratic development. Deeply embedded unwholesome practices and a range of malpractices and fraudulent activities in the electoral process grossly undermine its utility as a vehicle for liberal democratic development. The less the malpractices, the better the electoral process. The realistic thing is to bring malpractices to the barest minimum”.</p>
      <p>Speaking in similar vein, Dr Jonathan also canvassed electronic voting to ensure that the people’s votes count. The former President who spoke at a book presentation in Port Harcourt a few days ago, said the electorate would be able to elect quality leaders when they begin to vote electronically.</p>
      <p>He dismissed insinuations that most Nigerians have not attained the required technology knowledge to enable them key into electronic voting. According to him, electronic voting would work in Nigeria, owing to the fact that many Nigerians transfer billions of dollars from one bank to the other through electronic means.</p>
      <p>Dr Jonathan lamented the violence that characterised electioneering campaigns for the November 16 governorship campaigns in Kogi and Bayelsa States, saying that the situation could be avoided with electronic voting. Jonathan had said, “Look at what is happening now; we have governorship elections in two states in Kogi and Bayelsa. The signals coming from both are quite disturbing. The use of thugs, shooting guns and our people are already being killed when the voting process has not even started is disturbing. This would not happen if we have got to a point in this country where voter card matters.</p>
      <p>“That is why I have always advocated electronic voting. We must go into electronic voting. If people these days can transfer billions of dollars from one bank to the other, using electronic means, then I believe that we can do electronic voting perfectly and that will ensure that the use of thugs during elections would not come up again.”</p>
      <p>Jonathan further noted that political offices in the country did not change their holders, rather, the people with low integrity were being voted into offices. “When we develop as a nation to the point where our voter cards matter, where the people can vote who they believe in, the behaviour of the politicians would change; politicians would stop recruiting group of boys and feeding them like dogs, calling them thugs to be used for elections while their children attend the best universities abroad”, Jonathan said.</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari had declined assent to the amendment to the Act passed by the Eighth National Assembly two months to the general election. The President had expressed concern that signing a new Electoral Bill close to the 2019 general elections could create uncertainties about legislation guiding the elections. “Any real or apparent change to the rules this close to the election may provide an opportunity for disruption and confusion in respect of which law governs the electoral process”, the President had stated.</p>
      <p>Some analysts however, attributed the refusal of the President to sign the bill to the frosty relationship that existed between him and the leadership of the Eighth National Assembly. Others said some of the amendments effected by the last Assembly were self serving and that they sought to usurp the functions of INEC. This was cited in the amendment that sought to reorder the sequence of elections.</p>
      <p>However, with the cordial relationship between the Buhari Presidency and the Ninth Assembly, it is expected that there would be no friction that could impede progress on either side this time around. And by virtue of his position as the Deputy Senate President, Omo-Agege will be presiding over the next phase of amendment to the Electoral Act expected to kick off anytime soon. Already, an amendment has been made to Section 52 (2) which prohibits the use of electronic voting. However, attached to it is a proviso which gives INEC the discretion to adopt either electronic voting or any other method of voting. Will electronic voting carry the day? Over to Omo-Agege and his team.</p>
