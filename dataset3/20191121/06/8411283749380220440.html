      <h1>Taiwan handset shipments to post single-digit sequential growth 4Q19, says Digitimes Research</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:09:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:09</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Lin, DIGITIMES Research, Taipei</a></address>
      <p>Handset shipments by Taiwan's brand vendors and ODMs are expected to grow by a single-digit rate sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2019 after seeing their combined shipments edge up 3% on quarter to 14.21 million units a quarter earlier, Digitimes Research estimates.</p>
      <p>In the third quarter, Foxconn Group was the top player in unit shipments thanks to a rebound of feature phone orders from HMD Global (Nokia) despite a decline in smartphone ones.</p>
      <p>Brand vendors Austek Computer and HTC both suffered sequential shipment declines in the third quarter but with their rankings remaining unchanged in second and third.</p>
      <p>Compal Electronics stayed in fourth place thanks to orders from Sony Mobile Communications and US-based CAT, while Arima's shipments continued to decline in the third quarter as it has been producing handsets for lesser brands in Europe and emerging markets.</p>
      <p>On a yearly basis, handset shipments by Taiwan's brand vendors and ODMs are expected to tumble 30% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, with vendors rankings to remain unchanged, <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/reports/">Digitimes Research </a>estimates.</p>
