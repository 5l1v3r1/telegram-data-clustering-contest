      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday</a> has come early for the Galaxy S10. Today, you can get either the Galaxy S10 or Galaxy S10+ for $200 off of its regular price (that's $699 or $799, respectively). And you can also get a free pair of Galaxy Buds for that same price.</p>
      <p>These are the same prices that Samsung will offer for the Galaxy S10 and S10+ come Black Friday, but the Galaxy Buds aren't included on Black Friday, technically making this an even better deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/03/samsung-galaxy-s10-review-good-buy.html">The Galaxy S10</a> was Samsung's big flagship smartphone for the early part of the year. Complete with a 6.1-inch 1440p display. Powered by the Snapdragon 855 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>

      <p>Galaxy S10+ has mostly the same specs, but features a larger 6.4-inch display. Still sports the same Snapdragon 855 chipset, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Though if you upgrade to 512GB of storage, it does jump to 12GB of RAM.</p>
      <p>Both smartphones have triple cameras on the back â€“ ultrawide, main and telephoto. While the Galaxy S10+ has a dual front-facing camera and the Galaxy S10 has a single front-facing camera.</p>
      <p>Then there's the Galaxy Buds. This is Samsung's latest pair of truly wireless headphones, and they are actually really good. They offer a lot of the same features as the Airpods, but for Samsung smartphones. Which makes this a great pair.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Open the Galaxy Buds, and it will automatically start pairing with your Galaxy S10. Making it easier than ever to pair them. They also offer up some really good sounding audio, and aren't too large. That's one of the main issues with most truly wireless headphones on the market today.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the <a href="https://geni.us/FI5S">Galaxy S10</a> or <a href="https://geni.us/BxHHKUa">Galaxy S10+</a> and the free pair of Galaxy Buds from Amazon <a href="https://geni.us/BxHHKUa">by clicking here</a>. This sale won't last long though, so you'll want to hurry.</p>
