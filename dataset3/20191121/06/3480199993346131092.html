      </p>
      <p>Llewellyn, Supersad and Bratton went to Jamie Jackson's home on April 7 2018 and attacked him with a rock, knocking him unconscious and breaking his jaw.</p>
      <p>The three denied grievous bodily harm with intent but were found guilty by a jury at Shrewsbury Crown Court earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Following the sentencing, Detective Constable Darren Holmes of Shrewsbury CID said: "We welcome the result and sentencing which reflects the viciousness of the attack on the victim and I hope that it brings some sense of justice to him."</p>
      <p>All three men were also ordered not to contact Jamie Jackson for the next ten years.</p>
