      <p>Warriors interim coach Joey Antipas yesterday sensationally announced that he was departing from the National Football team after leading them to victory against Zambia  in a Total Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Heroes Stadium in Zambia.</p>
      <p>The Warriors won 2-1 through a brace by forward Khama Billiat to register Zimbabwe’s first win over Chipolopolo as Zambia is popularly known as in an Afcon qualifier.</p>
      <p>The two teams had previously met four times with Zambia recording two wins while the other encounters ended in draws.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chronicle.co.zw/updated-antipas-dumps-warriors/">Antipas is leaving the national team</a> after managing them at for six matches in which he recorded three wins, two draws and one loss in three different competitions, posting a 61,12 percent success rate.</p>
      <aside>“I take a bow,”<br/>said Antipas whose local club Chicken Inn is in the hunt for their second league title in five years<br/>“I was only in charge for six games up to December 2019,” he said.</aside>
      <p>With Chan finals getting underway in January next year in Cameroon, Zifa must now quickly find Antipas’ replacement or negotiate with him for possible contract renewal</p>
      <p>Zifa competitions and communications manager Xolisani Gwesela promised to give the association’s position today.</p>
      <aside>“I will only be able to give you our position tomorrow after consultations with my superiors,” he said.</aside>
