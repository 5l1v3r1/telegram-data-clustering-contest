      <p>Gov. Kevin Stitt’s plan to hire a full-time aide in Washington, D.C., has stalled, though Stitt has apparently not abandoned the idea.</p>
      <p>Stitt made a quick trip to Washington this week to testify before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee but did not interview anyone for a job representing Oklahoma interests in the nation’s capital.</p>
      <p>Donelle Harder, spokeswoman for Stitt, said, “The governor’s trip to Washington, D.C., was brief and solely focused on meeting with U.S. Senators who sit on the EPW Committee and testifying on Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.</p>
      <p>“The governor’s office is still looking to hire a public employee to represent the state full time in D.C., but has not yet taken further action towards fulfilling this priority at this time.”</p>
      <p>Stitt envisions hiring one full-time person and renting space in Washington. About 20 states have offices in Washington.</p>
      <p>Harder said in September that she was working on a job posting for the Washington office. The job has not been posted.</p>
      <p>The Oklahoma Transportation Department has been paying a lobbyist in Washington, as have the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University.</p>
      <p>Former Gov. David Walters, a Democrat, established a Washington office in 1991 to capture more federal money and influence policy. Former Gov. Frank Keating, a Republican, closed the office four years later, and there has not been one since.</p>
      <p>Sen. Jim Inhofe, the senior member of Oklahoma’s congressional delegation, praised Keating in 1995 for shutting down the office and told Harder a few weeks ago that a D.C. office wasn’t necessary because members of Congress were elected to represent the state in Washington.</p>
      <p>If the governor wanted to have an aide in his Oklahoma City office to monitor federal agencies, “I would support that,” Inhofe said in an interview in September.</p>
