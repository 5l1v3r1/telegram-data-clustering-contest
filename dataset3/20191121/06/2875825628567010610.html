      <h1>Jim Gavin remaining as Dublin boss because of player pressure says Mick Bohan</h1>
      <h2>Bohan believes that a number of players would have retired if the manager had decided to step down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>Pressure from the players is behind Jim Gavin’s decision to continue as Dublin manager, Mick Bohan reckons.</p>
      <p>Bohan, who was part of Gavin’s coaching team when Dublin won the All-Ireland in 2013, believes that a number of players, led by Stephen Cluxton, would have retired if the manager had decided to step down after seven glory-laden seasons at the helm.</p>
      <p>It was speculated that he would in light of September’s five-in-a-row landmark but he’s back on board for 2020, with only Bernard Brogan and Eoghan O’Gara having stepped down from the playing ranks.</p>
      <p>Bohan said: “He's incredible, isn't he? I'd say he felt under pressure from his group,  without doubt.</p>
      <p>“There's no doubt about it, like, if you look at it, the key man, Clucko, Clucko wouldn't have stayed if Jim had gone. That's one.</p>
      <p>“I don't know how many more would have been in the same boat. I don't know.</p>
      <p>“His burning desire to continue on is… we would certainly have to see ourselves in Dublin as lucky that he's doing that because, as I've said before, his likes are very hard to find.</p>
      <p>“His appetite to go back to the well again is incredible. I would have said, 'What has he got to achieve now?' And what have his group… because they built themselves up for this remarkable achievement. Where do you go then?</p>

      <p>“It's nearly like you've reached the ceiling, what do you do next? Unless the same thing exists in their culture which is just to play the game at the highest level that it can possibly be played for as long as we can. You'd nearly have to say that's what they are doing.”</p>
      <p>Bohan believes that the current Dublin men’s team will be truly appreciated once they are finally knocked off their perch.</p>
      <p>“They've been remarkable and are huge ambassadors for the game. I actually think that when, and the day will come, I don't know when, they are beaten, we'll all look back and thank them for driving the game and the standards of the game to a remarkable level.</p>
      <p>“Because whoever comes next whether it's Kerry or Tyrone are going to have to be unbelievable. And they will be, because Kerry were so close this year but I think the standard of the game has gone to an incredible place now.</p>
      <p>“As coaches now, right throughout, male and female, you look right across the board and think, 'That's our goal, that is our goal, to bring the game to that level'.</p>
      <p>“That makes everybody level of expectation higher, which makes the game more enjoyable, because that's what we go to see.”</p>
