      <h3>RACE 1 (2,400M)</h3>
      <p><b>(6) </b>SHANE needed his last outing and is bred for this distance. He should make a bold bid.</p>
      <p><b>(1) </b>TURF MASTER stays well and could prove hard to catch.</p>
      <p><b>(2) BRAVE DETAIL, </b><b>(3) VOODOO, </b><b>(7) WHIPPING BOY, </b><b>(8) DEAL ME IN </b>and <b>(10) CALLTOTHEBAR </b>are looking for minor money.</p>
      <h3>RACE 2 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(5) DUKE OF YORK </b>has been in the money in all four starts. His consistency can be rewarded.</p>
      <p><b>(3) CRANK IT UP</b> is improving and is a strong stable back-up.</p>
      <p><b>(10) LEPRECHAUN</b> races as a gelding now and could improve heaps.</p>
      <p><b>(11) ORPHELIN NOIR</b> wasn't disgraced on debut and the form has been franked.</p>
      <p><b>(15) VASEEM</b> found problems last start but could win being fresh.</p>
      <h3>RACE 3 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p>Johan van Vuuren has four runners and anyone could win.</p>
      <p><b>(16) SUPREME WIN</b> showed inexperience on debut and gets the nod.</p>
      <p><b>(14) DIFFERENT LIGHT</b> is running well and should be thereabouts again.</p>
      <p><b>(5) MAGNIFICUS</b> and <b>(4) GLADSTONE</b> could feature.</p>
      <p><b>(15) LADY SCARLETINA </b>did well in both starts and should be competitive.</p>
      <h3>RACE 4 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(3) SINGLE RED ROSE </b>has been in the money in all five starts and, if no first-timer finds strong money, should be hard to oppose.</p>
      <p><b>(1) OCEANS PRIDE </b>has done better with blinkers and could get into the money.</p>
      <p><b>(4) TARTAN DANCER</b> could earn being fresh.</p>
      <p>Watch newcomers, especially <b>(15) THAT'S JUST FINE </b>and <b>(16) WYLIE WENCH.</b></p>
      <h3>RACE 5 (1,200M)</h3>
      <p><b>(3) MASAAQAAT</b> has been threatening and should get her just reward.</p>
      <p><b>(9) COSMIC RAY</b> is improving with racing and should challenge.</p>
      <p><b>(14) ROCK YOU</b> wasn't disgraced on debut and will know more about it.</p>
      <p><b>(4) ARABELLA QUEEN </b>should be having her peak run and could get into the quartet.</p>
      <h3>RACE 6 (1,400M)</h3>
      <p><b>(2) TOKYO DRIFT</b> is holding form and should be involved in the finish.</p>
      <p><b>(11) NORLAND </b>is back to best and should be right there.</p>
      <p>Ignore <b>(10) CATEGORY FOUR'S</b> last run. He could turn it around with <b>(5) MOVIE MAGIC</b> on 2kg better terms.</p>
      <p><b>(4) LAZARUS TREE</b> could get into the mix with a 4kg claim.</p>
      <h3>RACE 7 (1,400M)</h3>
      <p><b>(1) HAWWAAM </b>did everything right in a sprint prep last time out. If he behaves again, he should show his class.</p>
      <p>However, he takes on classy <b>(2) CIRILLO</b> who comes off a rest and will take any advantage of a relapse in his behaviour.</p>
      <p><b>(3) ZOUAVES</b> and <b>(4) CAPTAIN ALDO </b>is back over a preferred distance and is looking for minor money.</p>
      <h3>RACE 8 (1,400M)</h3>
      <p>Recent debut winner <b>(15) LAND OF RUBIES </b>could improve more and follow up.</p>
      <p><b>(9) GOLDEN SPIRAL</b> is a form runner and should again give a good account.</p>
      <p><b>(1) SCENT OF EVENING</b> has a hefty weight but needed her last run and could feature.+</p>
      <p><b>(8) SEATTLE TANGO, </b><b>(4) SWEPT OFF MY FEET</b>and <b>(5) ZULU DAWN </b>warrant inclusion in all bets.</p>
