      <p>Two out of three stocks created nearly a decade ago by SandRidge Energy to raise about $1.6 billion in capital have been relegated to over-the-counter trading as the funding program nears completion.</p>
      <p>SandRidge Mississippian Trust I, which had been traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SDT, was removed from the exchange this week.</p>
      <p>A release issued by Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co., its trustee, stated the stock was delisted after it failed to satisfy the exchange’s continued listing compliance standard.</p>
      <p>Under the exchange’s rules, a stock initially is given a six-month curative period to regain compliance with its minimum $1 per share price requirement and can do so by having a closing price of at least $1 on the last trading day of two consecutive calendar months during that time.</p>
      <p>Its curative period ended on Nov. 16, the release stated.</p>
      <p>The delisting of SandRidge Mississippian Trust I comes on the heels of a New York Stock Exchange’s delisting of SandRidge Mississippian Trust II.</p>
      <p>The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co., its trustee as well, announced the stock exchange took that action for the same reason on Nov. 11.</p>
      <p>The second trust’s shares were traded on the exchange under the ticker “SDR.”</p>
      <p>In April 2011, SandRidge raised nearly $340 million from an initial public offering of Trust I, which owned royalty interests in the company's holdings in the Mississippian formation in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas.</p>
      <p>Initially, SandRidge held about 38% of its stock.</p>
      <p>Then in January 2012, SandRidge debuted its plan to raise about a half billion additional dollars by creating its second Mississippian trust, holding royalty interests for wells on about 53,000 net acres in the Mississippian formation in northern Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>
      <p>The Oklahoma City-based company raised nearly $630 million from its Trust II deal.</p>
      <p>Another trust the company created in 2011 that functioned as the same type of cash-raising vehicle, the SandRidge Permian Trust, continues to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Its stock, traded under the ticker PER, opened for trading Wednesday at $1.04 a share. The company raised about $600 million through that stock’s initial public offering.</p>
      <p>SandRidge Mississippian Trust I has 28 million shares, nearly 27% of which are held by insiders.</p>
      <p>Data could not be obtained Wednesday on total shares or insider percentages for SandRidge Mississippian Trust II.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Company challenged</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, SandRidge Energy reported a third-quarter loss of $182 million as both prices for what it produced and the amount it pulled from the ground declined, year-over-year.</p>
      <p>The loss translated to $5.12 a share, compared to a profit of $11.7 million, or 33 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues slipped to $58.4 million, down from $97.7 million one year ago.</p>
      <p>SandRidge produced almost 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent in the third quarter, including 2.2 million equivalent barrels in Oklahoma. That's down from total production of 3.1 million equivalent barrels in the year-ago quarter.</p>
      <p>The company's net realized prices for the period were $53.53 per barrel of oil, $10.11 per barrel of natural gas liquids and 93 cents per thousand cubic feet of natural gas.</p>
      <p>“During the third quarter, we faced a challenging price environment, particularly with regard to NGLs (natural gas liquids), which significantly impacted our results," CEO Paul McKinney said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"We continued to focus our efforts on further reducing our G&amp;A (general and administrative) costs, evaluating various M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) opportunities and reviewing our capital spending plans for the rest of the year.”</p>
      <p>Back when SandRidge created the trusts, it also faced challenges.</p>
      <p>But then, the challenge was to grow production as quickly as it could, and up-front cash was the definite cure.</p>
      <p>Kevin R. White, who in 2011 was SandRidge’s senior vice president for business development, said the company decided to launch to offerings to meet immediate cash flow needs by monetizing the value of its resources.</p>
      <p>SandRidge, he explained, had $1.8 billion capital programs for both 2011 and 2012.</p>
      <p>“Since these programs require more than the cash flow we will generate either year, we needed to raise outside capital,” White said.</p>
      <p>While the company did give up ownership of some of its holdings through those sales, White said it judged the deals as valuable because SandRidge still retained both significant economic interests in the plays and maintained operational control.</p>
      <p>“We view royalty trusts as an efficient, attractive source of capital for SandRidge, and for investors in the trusts, a good alternative owning an attractive cash yielding security,” he said.</p>
      <p>SandRidge Mississippian Trust I shares began trading on the OTC Pink Market, operated by OTC Markets Group, on Tuesday under the ticker “SDTTU.”</p>
      <p>SandRidge Mississippian Trust II shares began trading on the OTC Pink Market under the ticker “SDRMU” on Nov. 12.</p>
