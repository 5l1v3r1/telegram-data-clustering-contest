        <b>Promising young footballers from Japan, Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore will do battle at the fourth edition of the Under-15 International Challenge Cup organised by the Football Association of Singapore from Saturday to Nov 29.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Two locals sides - the Singapore Under-15 team and Singapore Sports School (SSP) - will feature in the competition, which will see two groups of four.</p>
      <p>The foreign teams taking part are three-time champions Promotion Fund for Vietnamese Football Talents (PVF), Malaysia's Johor Darul Ta'zim (JDT), Japan's Matsumoto Yamaga, Indonesia's Garuda Unity and Australia's Melbourne City College and Perth United.</p>
      <p>All matches will be at the Singapore Sports School, except for the semi-finals and final which will be held at the Jalan Besar Stadium.</p>
      <p>Said SSP coach Isa Halim: "This competition will expose the players to different teams and their varying styles of play.</p>
      <p>"Also, it will give my team the chance to compete and understand the demands of international football.</p>
      <p>"I want my players to adapt to these demands and give a good account of themselves by applying what they have learnt."</p>
