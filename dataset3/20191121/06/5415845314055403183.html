      <p>I have thoroughly enjoyed the news coming out of Tottenham Hotspur this week. First, they fire the English media darling Mauricio Pochettino, further confirming that his inability to win anything was unacceptable. Then, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50495686">they hired Jose Mourinho</a>. Fricking amazing! I just love it. But I don’t love some of the reactions coming from <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> fans.</p>
      <p>For instance, imagine my shock when I logged on to Pain in the Arsenal today and saw that my cohort Andy was writing an article that indicated that Pochettino was better than Emery. Now, to be fair, I didn’t read the article (yet). I did the typical consumerism and read the headline, accepted the outrage, and then wrote this.</p>
      <p>But honestly, I do not understand how anyone could conclusively say that Pochettino is better than Emery. And there are a lot of reasons why, but let’s start with what I consider to be the three most obvious ones.</p>

      </p>
      <p>We’ll start with No. 3.</p>
      <h3>3. Pochettino wasn’t following Arsene Wenger</h3>
      <p>Maybe this sounds like a cop-out to some, but it’s anything but that. There is such an added weight added to any manager who has to follow the greatest manager in club history. For 22 years Arsene Wenger built his own brand, his own style, his own culture and infused it into the Arsenal DNA.</p>
      <p>You expect it to be a smooth transition, going from Wenger to anyone else? That’s ridiculous. No one is going to be able to carry on what Arsene Wenger did flawlessly except Arsene Wenger. And while Unai Emery has bumbled a lot of things, the task of following up a legend is a monumental task that should have been foreshadowed by Manchester United. But we shouldn’t even be pulling those comparisons yet, because Emery is still here, and we didn’t cave and hire Jose Mourinho after a year.</p>
      <p>Pochettino didn’t follow up anyone of note, because honestly, Spurs haven’t had anyone of note. They haven’t had a Wenger. Pochettino was supposed to be that guy, but he failed.</p>
      <p>On to No. 2.</p>
