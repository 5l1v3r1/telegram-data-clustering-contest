The actor’s youngest sister, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/arpita-khan">Arpita Khan Sharma</a> is pregnant with her second baby and is due to deliver next month. According to Mumbai Mirror, Arpita and husband Aayush Sharma are planning to welcome baby number two through c-section on Salman Khan’s birthday, on December 27. The actor will turn 54 next month and will reportedly share his birthday with the newborn. Arpita and Aayush are fond of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Salman-Khan">Salman Khan</a> and hence have scheduled the good news for his birthday.</p>

      <p>December will not just be a special month for Salman on the personal front, but professionally too, the actor has a big film lined up for release. A week before Salman’s birthday, his cop drama ‘Dabangg 3’ will hit the screens on December 20. The much awaited film will feature Salman in a younger avatar in the flashback portions wherein he will romance debutante Saiee Manjrekar, while Soanakshi Sinha will reprise in her role of Rajjo.</p>
      <p>Salman Khan usually celebrates his birthday at his Karjat farmhouse, however with some special plans in place it remains to be seen how the actor celebrates the occasion.</p>
