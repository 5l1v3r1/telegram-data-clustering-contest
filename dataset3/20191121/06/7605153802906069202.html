        <b>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa, Nov 20 – Joey Antipas said on Wednesday he was quitting as caretaker coach of Zimbabwe, one day after achieving the best result of his four months in charge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zimbabwe scored a rare victory in neighbouring Zambia on Tuesday with the 2-1 win placing them second behind defending champions Algeria in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying group.</p>
      <p>In other matches under Antipas, Zimbabwe drew with Botswana in the Cup of Nations and recovered from a shock loss in Somalia to beat them on aggregate in a 2022 World Cup eliminator.</p>
      <p>He replaced fellow former international defender Sunday Chidzambwa, who quit after a winless first round exit from the 2019 Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Antipas offered no reason for leaving, saying only that he was “bowing out”, but Zimbabwe have time to weigh options with the next competitive match a 2022 World Cup qualifier in March.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe are ranked 29th in Africa and 117th in the world and have generally underperformed since the country gained independence 39 years ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Burundi officials have defended coach Olivier Niyungeko after losses to the Central African Republic and Morocco in the Cup of Nations.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– ‘Complex’ –</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The problem is not coach Olivier Niyungeko, the problem with the national team is complex,” an official said without giving further details.</p>
      <p>Niyungeko became a national hero last year when he guided the tiny central African country to the biennial continental tournament for the first time.</p>
      <p>But the ‘Swallows’ flopped last week, losing 2-0 away to the Central African Republic and 3-0 at home to Morocco, who punished a series of defensive blunders.</p>
      <p>Already four points adrift of joint leaders Morocco and Mauritania, the odds are stacked against Burundi reaching successive Cup of Nations tournaments.</p>
      <p>Another coach under pressure is Ibrahim Kamara, whose star-stacked Ivory Coast side struggled to overcome Niger, then fell to Ethiopia, a country ranked 95 places lower in the world.</p>
      <p>Despite boasting a squad including Premier League trio Serge Aurier, Nicolas Pepe and Wilfried Zaha, the Ivorians missed a penalty before converting a second spot-kick to edge the Nigeriens.</p>
      <p>After Aurier scored early in Ethiopia, they conceded twice in 10 minutes to lose and leave Kamara feeling uncomfortable while officials privately ponder hiring a foreign coach.</p>
      <p>Before local Kamara was appointed, Ivory Coast hired numerous Europeans, including Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson, Bosnian Vahid Halilhodzic and Frenchman Herve Renard.</p>
