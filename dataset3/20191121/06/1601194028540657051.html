Post the training session, the Islanders presented the SO Bharat team with a Mumbai City FC shirt and a football autographed by the squad as a token of appreciation.</p>

We are glad that we could share an evening and spend some time on the pitch with them. Sports teaches each and one of us that we have to keep going when it gets tough and it's incredible to see the way Special Olympics Bharat is helping the children deal with the rigours of life through sport. On behalf of the club and the entire team, I wish them the best in the future and look forward to meeting them again soon.”</p>
