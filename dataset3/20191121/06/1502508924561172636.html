      <p>The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to hear after four weeks a PIL seeking identification and deportation of all illegal immigrants and infiltrators, including Bangladeshi nationals and Rohingyas.</p>
      <p>A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde took note of the submission of lawyer and BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay that the illegal Rohingya and Bangladeshi immigrants "were taking away bread and butter of citizens here".</p>
      <p>"List it (PIL) for hearing after four weeks," the bench, which also included justices Sanjiv Khanna and Surya Kant, said.</p>
      <p>In his plea, Upadhyay has favoured the Centre's stand to identify and deport to Myanmar around 40,000 illegal <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/rohingya-muslims">Rohingya Muslims </a>staying in India.</p>
      <p>The plea has sought a direction to the Centre and the state governments to identify, detain and deport all illegal immigrants and infiltrators.</p>
      <p>"The large-scale illegal migrants, particularly from Myanmar and Bangladesh, have not only threatened the demographic structure of bordering districts but have seriously impaired the security and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>integration, particularly in the present circumstances," the plea stated.</p>
      <p>It alleged there was an organised influx of illegal immigrants from Myanmar through agents and touts who facilitate Rohingyas' entry into India via Benapole-Haridaspur and Hilli (West Bengal), Sonamora (Tripura), Kolkata and Guwahati.</p>
      <p>"This situation is seriously harming the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>security of the country," it said.</p>
