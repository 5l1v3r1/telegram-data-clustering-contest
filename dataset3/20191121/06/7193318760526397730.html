      <p>Reba McEntire, Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, Brooks &amp; Dunn, Vince Gill and Yolanda Kondonassis are among the musical standouts with Oklahoma ties nominated for the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>In addition, Tuscon, Arizona-based indie rock band Calexico, which includes drummer John Convertino, who grew up in Tulsa, and Iron &amp; Wine, aka singer-songwriter Sam Beam, garnered two nods.</p>
      <p>Also, the Broadway cast recording of the new revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" and bluesman Keb' Mo's album "Oklahoma" are among the nominees.</p>
      <p>The nominees for the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards were announced Wednesday. The show will be broadcast live from Staples Center in Los Angeles Jan. 26 on CBS, with Alicia Keys hosting for the second year.</p>
      <p>A Chockie native, McEntire, who has won three Grammys, earned a nod for best country album for her "real country" release "Stronger Than the Truth."</p>
      <p>“I’m back to my roots, the kind of songs that I sang when I was growing up playing dance halls and rodeos with Pake and Susie when we were kids," McEntire said, referring to her brother and sister in a spring interview with The Oklahoman.</p>
      <p>“I mean, it’s just so much fun to sing hardcore country music again. ... I think it’s the right time for the album, I think it’s the right time for me. I’m ready to hear some stone-cold country music, and if I can’t hear it somewhere else, I’ll just go record it.”</p>
      <p>Also nominated for best country album are the Pistol Annies — Ashley Monroe, Angaleena Presley and Lambert, a former Tishomingo resident — for their third collection, "Interstate Gospel."</p>
      <p>The intriguing country album competition also includes Eric Church's "Desperate Man," which features a title track co-written by Church and Soper native Ray Wylie Hubbard; Thomas Rhett's "Center Point Road," which includes the song "That Old Truck," co-written by Tulsa native Ryan Tedder; and Tanya Tucker's "While I'm Livin'," her first new album in 17 years.</p>
      <p>In addition, Lambert is nominated alongside fellow songwriters Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna and Liz Rose for best country song for penning "It All Comes Out in the Wash," the bubbly lead-off single from her newly released solo album "Wildcard."</p>
      <p>An Ada native, Shelton is nominated for best country solo performance for his intensely swampy smash "God's Country."</p>
      <p>Recent Country Music Hall of Fame inductees Brooks &amp; Dunn — Louisiana native Kix Brooks and former Tulsan Ronnie Dunn — earned a nod for best country duo/group performance for their new rendition of their 1990s hit "Brand New Man" featuring up-and-coming star Luke Combs.</p>
      <p>Already a record holder for most Grammy wins by a male country artist with 21, Gill, who hails from Oklahoma City, is nominated for best Americana roots song for "I Don't Wanna Ride the Rails No More," from his 2019 album "Okie."</p>
      <p>Previously Grammy nominated for her 2008 album "Air," renowned harpist Kondonassis, a Norman native, garnered a nod for best classical instrumental solo on Jennifer Higdon's “Concerto for Harp and Orchestra," conducted by Ward Stare and performed with The Rochester (New York) Philharmonic Orchestra.</p>
      <p>The concerto, which Kondonassis commissioned, also earned Higdon a nomination for best contemporary classical composition. Several orchestras co-commissioned the piece with Kondonassis, including the Oklahoma City Philharmonic, with whom the harpist performed the concerto in January.</p>
      <p>“It’s almost a grassroots commission. … It’s been really cool places that don’t often get a commission, don’t often get to get their name in the score of a major work written by a Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer. So, it’s been really fun. I’m so grateful that Oklahoma City was willing to climb onboard with this one and help make it happen," Kondonassis told The Oklahoman last December.</p>
      <p>Calexico and Iron &amp; Wine garnered a nomination for best Americana album for their collaborative release "Years to Burn," as well as a nod for best American roots performance for the soulful track "Father Mountain."</p>
      <p>Nashville, Tennessee-based bluesman Keb' Mo' also received a nod in the best Americana album category for his new collection "Oklahoma," an homage to the Sooner State's wide-open spaces. The title track was inspired by a visit to the state to play a benefit show with Kenny Wayne Shepherd following the destructive 2013 tornadoes. He collaborated on the album with songwriter Dara Tucker, an Oklahoma native.</p>
      <p>The 2019 Broadway cast recording of the Tony-winning revival of "Oklahoma!" is nominated for best musical theater album. The reimagining Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II's iconic show, which includes among its producers Tulsa-based Square 1 Theatrics, co-founded by Jay Krottinger and Ryan Jude Tanner, swaps the original score's brassy sound for a seven-piece country band. Closing on Broadway in January, the new version of “Oklahoma!” will launch its North American tour in Oklahoma City at the Civic Center Music Hall in fall 2020.</p>
      <p>Other nods of interest to Oklahoma music fans: Vince Mendoza is nominated for best arrangement, instruments and vocals, as the arranger for former Owasso resident Trisha Yearwood's cover of the standard "Somewhere Over the Rainbow," and PJ Morton's "Paul," nominated for best R&amp;B album, features a cover of "Yearning For Your Love," a 1981 hit from Tulsa's The Gap Band.</p>
      <p>Leading nominees for this year's Grammy Awards including Lizzo with eight nods, followed by Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X, who each earned six nominations.</p>
