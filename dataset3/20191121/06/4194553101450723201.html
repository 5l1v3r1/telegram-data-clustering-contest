      <h1>Some LFC fans think Harvey Elliott is doing Guardiola impression &amp; love it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:36:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/biscansboots/" target="_blank">Biscan's Boots</a></address>
      <p>A section of Liverpool fans in a replies section on Twitter are joking that Harvey Elliott has been snapped doing an impression of Pep Guardiola.</p>
      <p>The 16-year-old has already received an FA ban for mocking Harry Kane before he even arrived at the club, but this is by no means offensive and is purely in reference to Pepâ€™s behaviour at Anfield the other weekâ€¦</p>
      <p>The Spaniard was furious on the touchline and did a bizarre â€˜twice, TWICE!â€™ dance which has since gone viral ten times over.</p>
      <p>As a result, some supporters reckon this picture of Elliott putting up his two fingers is in reference to Guardiolaâ€™s meltdown!</p>
      <p>It probably isnâ€™t, of course, but itâ€™s still a nice excuse to watch the video of Pep squirming once moreâ€¦</p>
      <p>We beat Manchester City 3-1 after completely outplaying them, but so bad are they at accepting defeat, Pep and the club wrote to the FA about the (in our opinion impeccable) performance of referee Michael Oliver.</p>
      <p>Their bitterness knows no bounds!</p>
