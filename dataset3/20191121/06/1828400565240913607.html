      <p>The midfielder played the full 90 minutes in Tuesday’s 6-1 defeat by Germany in Frankfurt, his first start in a competitive senior international.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland boss O’Neill said: “I was really pleased with Jordan Thompson. I thought he did really well in the game.”</p>
      <p>However, the new Stoke City manager added that the match showed how Northern Ireland can struggle when below full strength.</p>
      <p>He added; "We probably had three of our first-choice back four unavailable tonight. What that did show is that we don't have the strength in depth to deal with this quality of opposition. It was a tough learning curve for them.</p>
      <p>"We had a double-header against the Netherlands and Germany, and it shows that we need to be at full strength to deal with this quality of opposition."</p>
      <p>His side finished third in their Euro 2020 group but could still qualify via the play-offs. They face Bosnia and Herzegovina in March.</p>
