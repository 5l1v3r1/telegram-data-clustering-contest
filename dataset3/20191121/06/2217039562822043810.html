        <b>If you travel overseas this holiday season, you are bound to feel peckish at some point - at the airport, on a plane, in between destinations or even in your hotel room.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ready-to-eat foods that you can munch on and give you a boost of energy while on the go are the most practical solution.</p>
      <p>So pack some healthy snacks from FairPrice Housebrand's range of cashew nuts that is not only loaded with antioxidants but is also a source of many nutrients to keep hunger pangs at bay.</p>
      <p>For those who prefer the fuss-free original flavour, get the FairPrice Baked Cashew Nuts (150g, $4.30).</p>
      <p>High in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and lower in sodium, the Healthier Choice-certified product is not only a good source of protein, it is also trans fat free and halal.</p>
      <p>For a more premium version, check out the FairPrice Party Snacks - Natural Baked Cashews (400g, $10.95).</p>
      <p>For those who have allergies, it is important to note that the product contains tree nuts and may contain eggs and fish.</p>
      <p>If you prefer variety, the FairPrice Baked Walnuts with Cashews Nuts (150g, $5.25) will surely satisfy.</p>
      <p>Also a Healthier Choice-certified product that is lower in sodium, the hypoallergenic item is naturally cholesterol free and trans fat free.</p>
      <p>Or choose from alternatives such as the FairPrice Baked Cashew Nuts with Almonds (150g, $4.95) or FairPrice Baked Macadamia with Cashew Nuts (150g, $5.65).</p>
      <p>Naturally cholesterol free and trans fat free, it is also a Healthier Choice-certified product that is lower in sodium.</p>
      <p>However, do take note that the product has tree nuts and may contain gluten, crustacean, eggs, peanut and soy.</p>
      <p>For a more fruity version, the FairPrice Snacks - Natural Fruits &amp; Nuts (150g, $4.95) is high in dietary fibre, trans fat free and very low in sodium.</p>
      <p>It contains natural fruits and nuts. Those with allergies should note that it has tree nuts and sulphites.</p>
      <p>Tissue and wet wipes are also a must when travelling.</p>
      <p>After going nutty over these tidbits, clean up with FairPrice Soft Pocket Handkerchiefs ($4.80) or FairPrice Soft Pocket Handkerchiefs - Fruity ($4.80), with 40 x 10 for each pack, made from 100 per cent pulp.</p>
      <p>In addition, they also have the Singapore Green Label, a seal of endorsement on their environmentally-friendly claims to prevent the abuse of green-washing.</p>
      <p>This has proved to be advantageous for Green Label-certified products, which have become more marketable and readily accepted by consumers or businesses when making a purchase.</p>
      <p>They are also certified by non-profit organisation Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), which means that the materials came from responsible forests.</p>
      <p>By choosing products with FSC labels, one is helping to take care of the world's forests.</p>
      <p>For a more thorough wipe down, the alcohol-free and pH neutral FairPrice Anti-Bacterial Wet Wipes ($3.10) - which come in a 3 x 15 pack with an additional free 15 sheets for each pack - are perfect.</p>
      <p>Not only is it softer and stronger to get rid of dirt and germs quickly, the aloe vera ingredient in the product leaves skin feeling moisturised, fresh and soft.</p>
      <p>For a stronger scent, get the alcohol free FairPrice Wet Tissues - Green Tea ($2) or the FairPrice Wet Tissues - Sakura ($2), both of which come in a 3 x 10 per pack.</p>
      <p>Gentle and mild with aloe vera,the wipes are not only hygienic and refreshing, but compact and handy as well.</p>
