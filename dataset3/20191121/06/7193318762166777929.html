      <p>SHAWNEE — A convicted cop killer was verbally, physically and sexually abused as a child and suffers from complex post traumatic stress disorder, a defense witness told jurors who will consider the killer's punishment.</p>
      <p>The witness, a child trauma specialist who interviewed defendant Byron Shepard and his mother, said the abuse, which included domestic violence, drug use and neglect, may have contributed to his criminal behavior.</p>
      <p>"His life started as trauma and it never went away," Michael Gomez told jurors Wednesday in the courtroom of Pottawatomie County District Judge John G. Canavan Jr. "Mr. Shepard has a lot of trauma and the majority of it is by people, by specifically caregivers."</p>
      <p>Gomez told jurors he did not perform a psychological evaluation of Shepard, but relied in part on statements made by friends and family of the defendant, including his mother, described as a drug user.</p>
      <p>The therapist testified about Shepard telling him his mother blamed him for her suicide attempt and later taught him how to cook methamphetamine.</p>
      <p>Gomez also testified he felt Shepard’s mental health issues are treatable.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty as punishment for Shepard, 38, of Okemah. He was convicted Monday of killing Tecumseh police officer Justin Terney, 22, on March 26, 2017, following a traffic stop and foot chase.They allege Shepard poses a "continuing threat to society."</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, prosecutors attacked the credibility of testimony by Gomez and another witness, neuropsychologist Antoinette McGarrahan.</p>
      <p>The prosecutors questioned why reports written by Gomez and McGarrahan relied on interviews with friends and family of the defendant that were conducted by defense investigators and contained inconsistencies.</p>
      <p>"Did you request any information from any other sources?" McGarrahan was asked on cross-examination.</p>
      <p>"I didn't find it necessary," the witness said.</p>
      <p>McGarrahan testified about interviewing the defendant and giving him a series of cognitive and emotional tests that revealed a below-average IQ and impaired problem-solving, planning and reasoning skills.</p>
