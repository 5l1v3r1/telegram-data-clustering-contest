      <p>An alert has been issued for sufferers of thunderstorm asthma, as stormy conditions and pollen levels increase. Here’s what you need to know to stay safe.</p>
      <p>The State Control Centre issued an advice message to the North East district at 12.05pm regarding thunderstorm asthma.</p>
      <p>It advises people may experience asthma symptoms or difficulty breathing due to the combination of thunderstorm activity and high grass pollen levels.</p>
      <p>“If you have a history of asthma or hay fever, or you experience wheezing, breathlessness, a feeling of tightness in the chest or a persistent cough, you should have reliever medication with you at all times today,” the advice message said.</p>
      <p>“Avoid the wind gusts before the storm. Go inside and close your windows and doors before and during the storm.</p>
      <p>“If you’re experiencing any of the above symptoms you may be having an asthma attack.</p>
      <p>“An asthma attack is serious and can be life threatening.”</p>
      <p>Ten people died on this day in 2016 due to the freak event.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has forecast a moderate risk of thunderstorm asthma for Victoria, while Melbourne’s pollen count is rated as extreme.</p>

      <p>With <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/e36642bf457dc0e6295b60b57adcd272">high temperatures, fires and strong winds predicted today</a>, the National Asthma Council is telling sufferers to stay vigilant.</p>
      <p>High pollen counts, smoke haze and thunderstorms can all trigger asthma.</p>
      <p>“People do not need to be in the immediate area of a fire to suffer from the effect of smoke on their lungs,” NAC chief executive Siobhan Brophy said.</p>
      <p>“Wherever smoke haze is visible, it is a threat to those with asthma.”</p>
      <p>Ms Brophy said tragic lessons have been learned about thunderstorm asthma during the last three years.</p>

      <p>“Thunderstorm asthma does not just occur in people with asthma, it affects those who have an</p>
      <p>allergic reaction to the grains in the air,” she said.</p>
      <p>“One in five Australians have hay fever and many do not know they could be at risk of having an asthma attack during a thunderstorm asthma event.”</p>
      <p>At-risk Victorians should avoid being outside during fires and storms, especially during windy</p>
      <p>weather, and should carry their asthma reliever with them at all times.</p>
      <p>The asthma council advises if you are having breathing difficulties but have not been diagnosed with asthma before, you should head to a doctor or pharmacist.</p>
