      <h1>EPF: Malaysia@Work incentives a 'win-win' for employees, employers</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): The Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which is the administrator of the RM6.5 billion Malaysia@Work scheme, said today the initiative's wage and hiring incentives will be a "win-win" for employees and employers.</p>
      <p>EPF chief executive officer Tunku Alizakri Alias said Malaysia@Work, an initiative under the Finance Ministry, "kills two birds with one stone" because it allows employees under the scheme's target groups to have a higher take-home pay, which will prepare them for the future.</p>
      <p>For employers, Alizakri said it will be cheaper for them to hire somebody from target groups under Malaysia@Work, which is also known as #MalaysiaKerja.</p>
      <p>Alizakri said that under Malaysia@Work, employees' statutory EPF contribution will be covered partially or fully by the scheme's wage incentive, instead of being deducted from their monthly salary.</p>
      <p>"The good news is that our graduates and other target segments are being prepared for the future while having higher take-home pay, and for employers, it will be cheaper for them to hire somebody from the Malaysia@Work [target groups]. It kills two birds with one stone.</p>
      <p>"This is about providing opportunities for work, bringing in employers as part of the solution," Alizakri told reporters on the sidelines of the EPF's International Social Well-Being Conference 2019 here today.</p>
      <p>The Malaysia@Work scheme was launched at the event.</p>
      <p>The four components of Malaysia@Work target specific groups. The Graduates@Work component focuses on employment for fresh graduates while Apprentice@Work aims to increase technical and vocational education and training participation among youths.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Women@Work component aims to attract talent among qualified women while Locals@Work is intended to promote dangerous, dirty and difficult, or 3D, jobs to Malaysians.</p>
      <p>To illustrate, Alizakri said an eligible employee under Graduates@Work will be entitled to a wage incentive of RM500 a month while employers are entitled to a hiring incentive up to RM300 a month for each new hire.</p>
      <p>Alizakri said these incentives will cover the employee and employer's respective monthly statutory EPF contributions that go towards the employee's EPF account.</p>
      <p>Thereafter, if there are leftovers from the employee's RM500 wage incentive, the balance will be credited into a special "third" EPF account for employees. Alizakri said the balance can be left in the account as savings, or withdrawn whenever desired.</p>
      <p>The Malaysia@Work incentives are valid for two years. The nationwide programme will commence in stages beginning from the second quarter of 2020.</p>
