      <p>All four Parliamentary candidates for the Ludlow Constituency seat will be involved in the event at the Community College hall in the town.</p>
      <p>Chaired by Edward Owen, the event has been organised by Churches Together, which said it continued a long tradition of holding hustings in the town during the run-up to a general election.</p>
      <h3>The four candidates are:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Philip Dunne - Conservative</li>
        <li>Heather Kidd - Liberal-Democrat</li>
        <li>Kuldip Sahota - Labour</li>
        <li>Hilary Wendt - Green</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Anyone who wants to ask the candidates a question on the night can put the question in a box which will be placed inside Bishop's Castle Town Hall. Organisers say questions can also be asked from the floor of the hall.</p>
      <p>The hustings begin at 7pm.</p>
