      <p>"You cannot be a suburb of nothing," then-Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett told Edmond Rotarians six years ago, touting the benefits of MAPS investments downtown.</p>
      <p>"A strong neighborhood makes a strong city," Parks Director Doug Kupper said Wednesday in remarks on MAPS 4 for business leaders from the Greater Oklahoma City Chamber.</p>
      <p>Nothing captures better the pivot represented by MAPS 4 and its proposals for investments citywide to enhance everyday quality of life.</p>
      <p>Kupper and two other city executives reviewed proposals for parks, transit, sprucing up major traffic corridors, and for new sidewalks, trails, bicycle lanes and streetlights.</p>
      <p>"The elements that are going to improve our neighborhoods will take us to the next level," Kupper said.</p>
      <p>MAPS 4 is expected to raise $978 million over eight years for 16 projects, including NBA arena renovations and expansion, a building for the domestic abuse-fighting Palomar Family Justice Center, and housing to help low-income residents avoid homelessness.</p>
      <p>Voters will decide Dec. 10 on extending the one-cent MAPS sales tax.</p>
      <p>Kupper, transit Director Jason Ferbrache and Assistant City Manager Aubrey McDermid highlighted common themes among the neighborhood-focused projects in their remarks Wednesday. Those were:</p>
      <p>• Connectivity: "With an expanded, robust transit system, we're able to provide that service to the parks," Ferbrache said. "We know there's already consideration of youth centers and how could those be located on bus routes."</p>
      <p>Forty-five percent of transit customers use the system to get to work, he said, but Embark also has partnerships with social service agencies. "We're a vital part of what their mission is, too," Ferbrache said.</p>
      <p>• Strategy: "It really feels like these independent projects have such a tie to each other," McDermid said. "If a community is disconnected from their day-to-day needs and from their quality-of-life amenities, the community is not going to be healthy, the city is not going to succeed, economic development is hard to capture.</p>
      <p>"If you are investing in individuals, the cumulative effect on the community is amazing," she said.</p>
      <p>• Competitive advantage: "We're brown most of the year," McDermid said, in remarks on plans for beautification projects. "We're flat. People call our trees 'shrubs,' they call our rivers 'streams,' they call our mountains 'hills.' We have to work really hard at making it beautiful.</p>
      <p>"MAPS 4 envisions putting that money in strategic locations, in corridors that reach the airport, leaving that first impression, on major districts, gateway entrances to announce, 'This is a place, I want you to remember me,'" she said.</p>
      <p>Proposed spending on parks, sidewalks, bike lanes, trails, streetlights, transit and beautification adds up to $344 million in MAPS 4.</p>
      <p>Another $70 million is allocated to youth centers and $30 million to senior health and wellness centers, serving wider areas but also situated in neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>"It's time for Oklahoma City to look at neighborhoods and put money back into neighborhoods," McDermid said.</p>
