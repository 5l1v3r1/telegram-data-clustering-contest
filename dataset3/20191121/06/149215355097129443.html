      <p>Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) traveled to Europe with three aides from Nov. 30 to Dec. 3, 2018, on a $63,000 taxpayer-funded investigative trip, and Lev Parnas, an <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878835/associates-allege-rudy-giuliani-partner-major-ukrainian-energy-project">associate of Rudy Giuliani</a> arrested <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/870992/giuliani-associates-arrested-before-planned-oneway-flight-prosecutors-say">last month</a> on federal <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/872083/pete-sessions-subpoena-tied-effort-oust-ukraine-ambassador-contemporaneous-campaign-donation">campaign finance</a> and conspiracy charges, helped arrange meetings and calls for his trip, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lev-parnas-helped-rep-devin-nunes-investigations"><i>The Daily Beast</i> reports</a>, citing Parnas lawyer Ed MacMahaon and congressional records. Nunes aide Derek Harvey was involved in the Parnas meeting, and he accompanied Nunes to Europe along with fellow aides Scott Glabe and George Pappas.</p>
      <p>At the time of the trip, Nunes was outgoing chairman of the House Intelligence Committee — he is now the committee's top Republican and <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879699/devin-nunes-face-after-gordon-sondlands-testimony-says-all">lead voice</a> in the public impeachment hearings. Nunes was visiting Europe as part of his investigation into the origins of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russia and President Trump's campaign. During the period Nunes was in Europe, Giuliani was in the middle of his ultimately successful campaign to oust U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Maria Yovanovitch, a plot Parnas and partner Igor Fruman were also involved in, according to the federal indictment.</p>
      <p>Parnas "believed that what he was doing was furtherance of the president's and thus our national interests," said Joseph Bondy, a member of Parnas' legal team. "President Trump's recent and regrettable disavowal of Mr. Parnas has caused him to rethink his involvement and the true reasons for his <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878074/report-giuliani-associate-lev-parnas-discussed-ukraine-trump-during-private-event">having been recruited</a> to participate in the President's activities. Mr. Parnas is <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/876312/rudy-giulianis-ukraine-connection-reportedly-willing-comply-house-impeachment-investigators">prepared to testify completely</a> and accurately about his involvement in the President and Rudy Giuliani's quid pro quo demands of Ukraine." <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lev-parnas-helped-rep-devin-nunes-investigations">Read more at <i>The Daily Beast</i></a>.</p>
