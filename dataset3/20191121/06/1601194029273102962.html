      <p>On tonight's episode of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/pro-wrestling/aew-dynamite">AEW Dynamite</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/darby-allin">Darby Allin</a> and Jon Moxley wrestled each other in the main event of the show, in a barnburner of a match which has been praised by the majority of the wrestling community.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of tonight's Dynamite, AEW EVP <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cody-rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> took to Twitter and had some huge praise for both performers.</p>
      <h3>Darby Allin's quick rise in AEW</h3>
      <p>Having departed from WWN earlier in the year, Darby Allin revealed that he had signed with All Elite Wrestling and became a regular member of the AEW roster. At the Fyter Fest pay-per-view, Allin competed in his debut match for the promotion when he wrestled Cody Rhodes to a time-limit draw.</p>
      <p>After suffering back-to-back losses at Fight for the Fallen and All Out, Allin had a number of wins on Dynamite that led to him being able to challenge for Chris Jericho's AEW World Championship on October 16, 2019 edition of Dynamite. Allin ended up losing the match due to outside interference from Jake Hager.</p>
      <p>However, on last week's episode of Dynamite, Allin accepted Jon Moxley's open challenge, as the latter was on the back of a huge win over Kenny Omega from Full Gear.</p>
      <h3>Cody praises both Allin and Moxley</h3>
      <p>On tonight's edition of AEW Dynamite, Jon Moxley defeated Darby Allin in the final match of the evening, in what turned out to be an outstanding back-and-forth contest between the pair.</p>
      <p>The match was well-liked and praised by almost everyone who tuned in live for this week's Dynamite and AEW EVP Cody Rhodes also took to Twitter to praise both his main-eventers for putting up a clinical performance.</p>
      <p>This is what Cody had to say to Allin:</p>

      <h3>What's next for Moxley following his win?</h3>
      <p>It will be interesting to see if Moxley and Allin will be involved in a long-term feud or if AEW decides to put the former IWGP US Champion in another brand new rivalry on AEW TV.</p>
