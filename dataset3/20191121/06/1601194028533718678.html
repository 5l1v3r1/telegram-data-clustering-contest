      <p>Ben Simmons said it felt good for his hard work to pay off after the Philadelphia 76ers star drained his first NBA three-pointer.</p>
      <p>Simmons ended his long wait for a regular-season three as the 76ers topped the New York Knicks 109-104 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The number one pick in the 2016 draft, All-Star guard Simmons had attempted 17 shots from beyond the arc in the league, with much made about his jump shot and unwillingness to shoot the three.</p>
      <p>Simmons, however, made a three-pointer in the opening quarter against the Knicks – his 172nd game in the NBA.</p>
      <p>"It feels good to put work in in the summer and it pays off," Simmons said post-game in Philadelphia midweek.</p>

      <p>Wells Fargo Center erupted as fans and team-mates celebrated Simmons' maiden three-pointer.</p>
      <p>Sixers head coach Brett Brown added: "Like I've said for a while now, other people get more excited about it than I do. But how can that not be a good thing? And, really, if we're all honest, that's the first legitimate sort of three he's taken.</p>
      <p>"A lot of them have been heaves at the end of periods, and stuff like that. But I think his footwork, his confidence, he rose up and he didn't blink. He looked great."</p>
      <p>There has been plenty of talk about Brown, who is reportedly finalising a deal to coach Australia at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Brown – who spent time coaching in Australia prior to his move to the San Antonio Spurs – previously led the Boomers to the 2012 Olympic Games quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>After sitting out this year's FIBA World Cup in China, Simmons said of Brown: "I'm excited. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>"He's coaching me now, so we have a great relationship. I've known him my whole life. I'm excited to put together a great team."</p>
