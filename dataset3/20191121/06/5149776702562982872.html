      <p>A Nottinghamshire man who lost a leg following a horror crash more than a decade ago has transformed himself competing as a bodybuilder.</p>
      <p>Craig Earley, 40, was hit by a van while riding a motorbike in Queen's Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">Beeston</a>, in 2003.</p>
      <p>It happened near the junction with Dovecote Lane and Mr Earley counts himself lucky to be alive.</p>
      <p>He found himself entangled under the front passenger wheels of the van, breaking his right leg and left arm.</p>
      <p>His left leg was shattered and later had to be amputated from below the knee.</p>
      <p>Mr Earley, who runs alternative gift shop Happy Daze, in Wollaton Road, Beeston, with his wife, went through a dark period after the crash.</p>
      <p>"I got quite depressed, I suppose," said Mr Earley, of Trent Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">Beeston Rylands</a>.</p>
      <p>"I didn't look at life in a nice way. I bloated up to maybe 15-and-a-half stone. All the medication they gave me. I didn't really see a reason to live."</p>
      <p>He got his life back on track when his wife, Alex, 42, fell pregnant with their first son, Elliot, now 13.</p>
      <p>"Something happened. I got up, I pushed myself forward, I went to the Prince's Trust, we opened our business, I started doing the gym and I think my son was the catalyst for me trying to find new avenues to make myself feel better," said Mr Earley.</p>
      <p>He has been going to the gym for several years and has been working for the past few months with personal trainer John Clarke, who launched PF Aesthetics in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/inside-new-gym-lenton-set-3271131">Willoughby Street, Lenton, earlier this year with a colleague</a>.</p>
      <p>With the help of Mr Clarke, Mr Earley is now in prime shape - describing himself as a "fine wine".</p>
      <p>"I got better as I got older," he said.</p>
      <p>He finished fourth last weekend in the qualifying stage of a competition called the UK BFF Sugar's Classic, competing in a category for people weighing less than 70kg in Leicester. "I've been crying for the past two days," said Mr Earley, who weighed in at 10st 8lbs.</p>

      <p>"I wanted to have done better but I realise now I did amazing because the standard of people that were there.</p>
      <p>"There's no way I could have beaten them because they've been training for 28 weeks. I knew about this competition for six weeks."</p>
      <p>The top three have gone through to the finals in October at Nottingham's Theatre Royal where Mr Earley has been invited to pose as a guest.</p>
      <p>Pleased with his body transformation, he said: "The pictures, they speak for themselves. It's there in black and white. It's amazing."</p>
      <p>Mr Earley's wife, Alex, said her husband's depression had 'lifted' since he'd been going to the gym.</p>
      <p>She said: "He feels more confident in his body image and in the way he feels in himself because he's managed to do this transformation."</p>
      <p>She described the journey as 'unbelievable', saying: "I took our youngest on Sunday (November 17).</p>

      <p>"All the time he (Mr Earley) was on stage he (son Isaac, eight) cried. It's such an achievement.</p>
      <p>"As soon as he got on stage he was like 'mummy, I can't stop crying with pride'."</p>
      <p>Personal trainer Mr Clarke, 40, of Carlton, said he knew Mr Earley was "good enough for a competition" after seeing him in a vest, saying he had a "phenomenal physique".</p>
      <p>"It's unbelievable what he's done," said Mr Clarke. "He has not quite realised what he's achieved.</p>
      <p>"He went against the country's best and he actually beat some of them."</p>
      <p>He added: "He brought the house down. Everyone was going crazy.</p>
      <p>"It could not have gone any better. It was just phenomenal."</p>

      <p>Describing the crash, Mr Earley said: "We were at a T-junction at a crossover, I pulled up, I wanted to go straight across the road.</p>
      <p>"There's traffic coming from the left and the right, the car that wanted to come from the right he slowed down, he wanted to turn - in the direction I was going to go - across the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">road</a>.</p>
      <p>"As soon as the traffic from the left was clear he flashed me so I went across.</p>
      <p>"Then a van undercut him and hit me in the middle of the road basically.</p>
      <p>"I went through his windscreen, I came back out, went under his wheels and that's where the damage was done then to my legs."</p>
      <p>He added: "I couldn't actually feel the accident. When I was under the van, loads of people stopped.</p>
      <p>"They tried to pick the van up to get my legs out. You could just see my legs were just hanging like pieces of spaghetti.</p>
      <p>"I remember it all but couldn't feel a thing.</p>
      <p>"Looking back at it, it could have been so, so much worse. The van absolutely hammered me. I came away with a missing leg.</p>
      <p>"I could have come away in a wheelchair to be fair, or dead."</p>
