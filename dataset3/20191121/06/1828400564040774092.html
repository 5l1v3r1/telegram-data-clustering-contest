      <p><b>READ MORE: </b><a href="https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/sport/football/blackpool-fc/competition-win-tickets-for-blackpool-v-scunthorpe-united-in-the-leasing-com-trophy-1-10112239"><b>Win tickets for Blackpool v Scunthorpe<br/></b></a>The skipper’s form has coincided with Blackpool recording four successive wins, including two in League One to lift them to fifth.</p>
      <p>And Spearing believes playing in a more liberated role is bringing the best out of him.</p>
      <p>He said: “The last couple of weeks I’ve kicked on a little bit. I feel I’m starting to bring out what I’m about and the lads around me are helping me to do that.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been given a bit more of a free role from the management, so I’m not solely concentrating on my defensive game.</p>
      <p>“Instead I’m letting the back three do their job and getting involved in the middle of the park, and I seem to be getting the rewards.</p>
      <p>“But with what I’m like, I’m still not happy. I want to keep getting better and improve for the rest of the season. I’m still challenging myself day in, day out because I want to improve constantly.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be 31 next week but I want to kick on and go for as long as I can.</p>
      <p>“The ambition now, with the new owner and the fans being back, is to give them something to cheer about.</p>
      <p>“They’ve been away for a long time. We want them to come back and support us, and we want to give them something back.</p>
      <p>“It’s exciting times but there’s a long way to go. We want to keep climbing up that league.</p>
      <p>“The fans have deserved a lot more than they got over the last few years.</p>
      <p>“They’ve finally got their club back and they deserve every single bit of it. We now have to show them what they were missing.</p>
      <p>“They’re supporting us for 90 minutes and it’s a massive thank you from myself and the players.</p>
      <p>“But we have to keep working hard and keep entertaining them to keep them coming through the gates.”</p>
      <p>Saturday brings a massive test at Portman Road, with title favourites Ipswich currently second but only three points behind leaders Wycombe Wanderers with two games in hand.</p>
      <p>But the Seasiders will not be fazed and Spearing sees no reason why they can’t return home with maximum points.</p>
      <p>“Why not?” he said. “We’ve deserved the four wins from four games but we know Ipswich will be a new challenge.</p>
      <p>“They’re a very good side with good players but we go there with nothing to lose.</p>
      <p>“We believe in ourselves and if we put across the commitment, the desire and the workrate we did against Wimbledon we can hopefully come out with a positive result.</p>
      <p>“Ipswich are up at the top and we want to beat the teams that are up there.</p>
      <p>“AFC Wimbledon (who Pool beat 2-0 last Saturday) might be near the bottom but we have to win those games as well. We can’t treat them any differently.</p>
      <p>“We need to work as hard as we can every week for those three points.”</p>
      <p>“The owner has big ambitions and it’s an exciting club to be at right now.”</p>
