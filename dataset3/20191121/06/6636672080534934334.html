      <p>At St Ives, focus will be placed on making major advances in battery and charger design.</p>
      <p>It will leverage the expertise that the company has built up in mission-critical defence and aerospace applications, and bring this to a wider range of prospective usage models – where heightened levels of reliability, safety and functional longevity are increasingly being mandated.</p>
      <p>Product areas that newly-recruited staff will be working include renewal energy generation/grid balancing, compact and lightweight high-density batteries for use in portable industrial equipment, ultra-reliable back-up power systems, plus lighting and power solutions for the mining industry.</p>
      <p>“The pace at which the energy storage sector is evolving means that ingenious new approaches to battery electronics, software and mechanical design are going to be required,” says chairman Nick Russel, “placing this centre in Cambridgeshire gives us direct access to the wealth of world-class engineering talent that is present there.”</p>
