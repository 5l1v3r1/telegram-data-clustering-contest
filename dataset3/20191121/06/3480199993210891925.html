      <p>Liz Bird, manager of the food bank, said that people in the town were continuing to generously offer food in the run up to the winter period.</p>
      <p>"We're getting more clients," she said. "There are more than last year.</p>
      <p>"It has been steadily rising since October last year.</p>
      <p>"It's down to quite a few things: universal credit, people going from Disability Living Allowance to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to Disability Living Allowance (DLA), bedroom tax and families breaking up."</p>
      <p>Ms Bird said people had already been in touch to find out what they can do to help in the coming moths.</p>
      <p>"People do the reverse advent calendar," she said. "People are asking about doing that already.</p>
      <p>"Last year we had toys donated, some people bought them for the children because we have a lot of families.</p>
      <p>"I did a talk for the knit and natter group at St John's Catholic Church and they're going to knit hats and gloves for us."</p>
      <p>A list of items needed by the food bank is put on their website and Facebook page each week.</p>
      <p>But Ms Bird said some people offer up some luxuries at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"People donate things that others wouldn't normally buy for themselves because they are more worried about food. Things like treats and body lotions.</p>
      <p>"People do donate food, chocolates and special things for the kids, but we get some things from M&amp;S on a Monday morning and quite often there's cakes and things that we hand out to families."</p>
      <p>This week 15 families were helped by Bridgnorth food bank. Five couples also received assistance.</p>
      <p>A total of 12 individuals plus four emergencies were helped.</p>
      <p>They currently need jam, rice, toilet rolls, dog food, biscuits, cook in sauces and squash, as well as milk puddings, soup, tea, coffee and deodorant.</p>
      <p>Strong bags with handles and half dozen empty egg boxes are also needed.</p>
