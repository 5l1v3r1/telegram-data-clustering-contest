      <p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">great bundle right now</a>, which includes the Amazon Fire TV Cube and the Ring Video Doorbell 2, for just $218.99. Normally this would cost you $318.99, so you're saving $100 on this bundle.</p>
      <p>The Amazon Fire TV Cube is basically a Fire TV and an Echo all-in-one. It can control your TV, and play Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and much more. But it also has always listening Alexa, so you can literally use your voice to control your TV. Now that is a really cool feature and definitely one that we'd like to see more of.</p>
      <p>The Fire TV Cube is able to control your TV because it is plugged into the HDMI port. So much like the Sonos Beam can control your TV, so can the Fire TV Cube.</p>

      <p>Then there's the Ring Video Doorbell 2. This is a video doorbell that you can install outside of your home. It'll be great for the holiday season when there are lots of packages coming to your door. This way you're able to see when they get there, and who might be trying to grab them. Since that is a real problem these days.</p>
      <p>With the Ring Video Doorbell 2, you're also going to get notifications when someone is at your door. This works even if they don't ring the doorbell. So you'll know exactly when someone is at your door, even if they are trying to steal a package or two.</p>
      <p>Ring Video Doorbell 2 does also work with Amazon Alexa, allowing you to bring up the video feed onto the big screen, and it can also ring through your Fire TV Cube and other Echo devices, like a traditional doorbell would.</p>
