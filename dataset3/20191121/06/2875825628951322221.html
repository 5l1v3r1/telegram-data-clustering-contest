      <h1>Kieran Fitzgerald not fussed about age as 39th birthday approaches</h1>

      <p>Kieran Fitzgerald doesn’t get too fussed about his age, though he is grateful that he’s not a few minutes older.</p>
      <p>On Sunday he chases a seventh Connacht club title to sit with a staggering 14 county and three All-Ireland club medals that he has won with Corofin as he closes in on his 39th birthday.</p>
      <p>Indeed, Fitzgerald was the very first baby born in Ireland in 1981, arriving just after the stroke of midnight on January 1, 1981, and was the subject of front page national newspaper coverage at the time.</p>
      <p>It meant that, in underage GAA terms, he was a full year older than a child born on December 31.</p>
      <p>“My mother says every year how nowadays they get all the perks, she didn’t get much now to be honest,” he smiles.</p>
      <p>“We played Dublin in an under-21 All-Ireland in 2002 and I remember going around in the parade thinking, ‘There’s nobody older than me here, this has to be some sort of an advantage!’ Yeah, that’s how it fell for me.”</p>
      <p>It goes full circle, of course. Last March, he was the oldest player in the parade for Corofin’s runaway victory over Dr Crokes in the All-Ireland club final, though he entertain thoughts of that at the time.</p>
      <p>“No, no,” he laughs. “It’s gone the other way now, it’s not much of an advantage when you go to the latter stages of your 30s now. Experience maybe might stand to you alright.”</p>
      <p>Of course, it’s not especially unusual for players to go into their late 30s, or even beyond, at senior club level, but perhaps less so in teams that are operating at Corofin’s level. But Fitzgerald says that’s what makes it all the easier to keep going.</p>

      <p>“Loads of people have commented on, ‘Oh you’re whatever age and you’re still playing’. I don’t see it that way.</p>
      <p>“I enjoy it and I feel fit and I’m with a club that’s successful. You want for nothing. You just basically bring your boots and turn up and play football. Everything’s there.</p>
      <p>“The guys that are playing in clubs that are struggling at the other end and they’re 38 and they’re struggling along like, they’re the boys that deserve the credit. They don’t see the likes of these days at all.</p>
      <p>“For me, I think there’s a lot more made of it outside of my group than within. There isn’t really much talk of it at all.”</p>
      <p>While Fitzgerald is wringing every last drop out of his club career, he was happy to finish with Galway at 30, the experience having become increasingly frustrating after winning an All-Ireland 10 years earlier in 2001.</p>
      <p>“I was fed up of it really, to be honest. Just injury-wise, found it very hard to stay fit. The demands were huge. I was working in Athlone. Just lost the gra for it really to be honest with you. I had 11 years done at that stage.</p>
      <p>“It was probably the best thing I did. I got a chance to reset again and clear up a few knocks and niggles.</p>
      <p>“I felt I wasn’t contributing the way I wanted to contribute and didn’t want to become a negative influence in there.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to concentrate on my club really and get back playing football.”</p>
