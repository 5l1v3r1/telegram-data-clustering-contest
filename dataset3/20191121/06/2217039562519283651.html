        <b>BANGKOK : Thailand's Constitutional Court yesterday disqualified outspoken opposition party leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit as a Member of Parliament after finding him guilty of violating election law.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mr Thanathorn, 40, has emerged as the most prominent opponent of a government headed by former junta chief Prayut Chan-o-cha, 65, after the progressive Future Forward Party came a surprise third in an election in March.</p>
      <p>The Constitutional Court found Mr Thanathorn guilty of holding shares in a media company on the date his candidacy was registered for the election to formally end five years of military rule.</p>
      <h3>ASSUMPTIONS</h3>
      <p>In its ruling, the court said the evidence against Mr Thanathorn outweighed that in his favour. The opposition leader had argued that he had disposed of the shares in time.</p>
      <p>After the ruling, Mr Thanathorn said the court had ruled based on assumptions rather than facts.</p>
      <p>"I'm still the leader of the Future Forward party and the party is the journey. The journey never ends," Mr Thanathorn said.</p>
      <p>"The people will move forward together and I'll continue to work on amending the constitution."</p>
      <p>Mr Thanathorn's party had won 80 out of 500 available seats in the Lower House of Parliament in the election.</p>
      <p>After the court ruling, #RIPThailand and #StandWithThanathorn were among the hashtags trending on Twitter in Thailand, along with his name and the party's name in Thai.</p>
      <p>Mr Thanathorn also faces two criminal charges, one for computer crimes for a speech he posted on Facebook criticising the junta last year, and another for sedition for allegedly aiding anti-junta protesters in 2015.</p>
      <p>In all, nearly 30 cases have been brought against Future Forward leaders. - REUTERS</p>
