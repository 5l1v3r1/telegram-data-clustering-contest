      <h1>Democratic debates: Snoozefest has top 4 running in place as other 6 feebly jab</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:24:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:24</time> by <a rel="author">Marisa Schultz and Aaron Feis</a></address>
      <p>ATLANTA — Ten Democratic presidential candidates <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/democratic-debates-arrow-pointing-up-for-a-couple-of-long-shots/">went through the motions Wednesday</a> night in a fifth-round debate long on reheated anti-Trump takes, canned zingers and Biden blunders, but short on guidance for undecided voters.</p>
      <p>The four presumed top contenders — former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg — seemed content to tread water while some among the six likely also-rans feebly tried to vault an ever-widening polling gap.</p>
      <p>In two of the few charged exchanges on a slow-as-a-drawl evening in Atlanta, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard took shots at Buttigieg, who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/buttigieg-rises-to-top-of-new-hampshire-polls-amid-surge-in-iowa-too/">propelled into the evening by surging poll showings</a> in the key battleground states of Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
      <p>“I have actually done this work,” said Klobuchar of navigation through Beltway gridlock, after referring to Buttigieg as a “local official” at the helm of a city that barely cracks 100,000 residents.</p>
      <p>“There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage, and where are we right now as a country?” challenged Buttigieg. “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters.”</p>
      <p>Gabbard tagged in to question fellow military veteran Buttigieg’s judgment for suggesting that US troops help fight the scourge of drug-cartel violence along the Mexican border.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg bristled at what seemed to be Gabbard’s implication.</p>
      <p>“Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico?” he asked, before turning from ­defense to offense.</p>
      <p>“Let’s also talk about judgment,” Buttigieg said to Gabbard. “One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was [Syrian dictator] Bashar al-Assad.”</p>
      <p>The response drew “oohs” from an audience at Tyler Perry Studios that had largely sat on its hands through the debate’s early going.</p>
      <p>California Sen. Kamala Harris previously launched another apparent broadside at Gabbard over the controversial 2017 Syria summit, but was rapped in return by Gabbard for “continuing to traffic in lies and smears and innuendos.”</p>
      <p>Biden — a once prohibitive frontrunner whose campaign has stagnated in recent months, primarily at the expense of Warren and Buttigieg — also drew flak.</p>
      <p>The most memorable shot came from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cory-booker-joe-biden-legal-marijuana_n_5dd609cae4b010f3f1d26de6?ncid=tweetlnkushpmg00000067">dinged birthday boy Biden</a>, who turned 77 Wednesday, for recently calling marijuana a “gateway drug” and opposing its legalization.</p>
      <p>“I thought you might have been high when you said it!” quipped a grinning Booker, in another rare crowd-pleasing line.</p>
      <p>But Biden’s biggest opponent on Wednesday night, as in previous debates, was himself.</p>
      <p>In one particularly cringeworthy moment, the gaffe-prone former veep invoked an unfortunate choice of words while attempting to articulate the importance of combating domestic violence.</p>
      <p>“We have to just change the culture . . . and keep punching at it and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/democratic-debate-joe-biden-says-we-need-to-keep-punching-at-domestic-violence/">punching at it and punching at it,</a>” he said, while ­repeatedly pumping his clenched fist.</p>

      <p>Some among the audience struggled to contain gallows-humor snickers as Biden, apparently oblivious, added, “No, I really mean it. It’s a gigantic issue.”</p>
      <p>Biden also erroneously said that he had secured the endorsement of the only black woman ever elected to the Senate, former Illinois Sen. Carol Moseley Braun — as Harris, another black female senator, stood mere feet from him onstage.</p>
      <p>“I said the first,” Biden later corrected, properly describing Braun’s distinction.</p>
      <p>Others had more anonymous nights, for reasons reflective of their standing in the polls.</p>
      <p>Warren and Sanders largely stuck to the script of their tried-and-true talking points on health care and income inequality, as they took another month to tread water near the top of the field.</p>
      <p>The chestnut slogan of each — Warren’s “I have a plan for that,” and Sanders’ “I wrote the damn [health care] bill” — made an appearance as they sought to stick with what’s worked up to this point.</p>
      <p>Some lower-polling White House aspirants did little to stand out, partly hampered by a distribution of screen time that favored the frontrunners.</p>
      <p>The field’s two outsider candidates, businessman Andrew Yang and billionaire hedge-funder Tom Steyer — making just his second appearance on the debate stage — were largely relegated to the background during the two-hour affair.</p>
      <p>Under limits <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/the-posts-viewing-guide-to-the-fifth-democratic-debate/">imposed by the Democratic National Committee</a> to progressively whittle down the overcrowded field, the polling and fundraising qualifications to make next month’s debate in Los Angeles will become more stringent. Candidates will need to log at least percent in four DNC-approved polls or 6 percent in two surveys — up from 3 and 5 percent, respectively — and register 200,000 unique donors, up from 165,000.</p>
      <p>Even if those rising hurdles drag down some sputtering campaigns, a pair of late entrants could still crash the party less than a year before Election Day 2020.</p>
      <p>Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick declared his candidacy last week, and former three-term New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is widely expected to enter the fray before long.</p>
