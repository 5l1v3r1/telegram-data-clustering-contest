      <p>Cory Sandhagen has been on a big ascent since joining the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a>. He has won 5 fights since joining the organization and has been very active, fighting 3 times in 2019 alone. Rightfully, he sits at #3 in the UFC Bantamweight rankings and could be just one win away from a title shot against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/henry-cejudo">Henry Cejudo</a>.</p>
      <p>He faces his toughest test to date this January as he takes on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/frankie-edgar">Frankie Edgar</a> at UFC Raleigh. It will be <i>The Answer</i>'s 135-pound debut and it's undoubtedly a huge task for the legend as he looks to win a championship in a second weight class.</p>
      <p>When speaking to <i><a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/cory-sandhagen-frankie-edgar-ufc-raleigh-longtime-fan-should-have-retired?fbclid=IwAR0mL1o3pkd0vy1joqBgcX2d3jFajuGLHaYNjp6NwD5hjekzavgk43v0RVA">MMA Junkie</a></i>, Sandhagen expressed a bit of sadness about having to put the stamp on Edgar's career, calling himself a big fan of <i>The Answer</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s a bummer almost for me because I really like Frankie.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“I’ve always been a really big fan of Frankie and I don’t want to be the one who puts the stamp on his career. But that’s kind of what my job is. That’s what I’m going to do. Not to sound arrogant. But he has to fight me on his first fight coming down to 135? That kind of sucks for him.”</blockquote>
      <p>Sandhagen even expressed concern for Edgar when it came to the weight-cutting process of making 135 pounds. He called himself a "nightmare" of a match-up for anyone and thinks that the answer wasn't for Edgar to move down to Bantamweight.</p>
      <p>He said that Edgar didn't look too bad against Holloway, but his post-fight interview was very revealing:</p>
      <blockquote>"I didn’t think he looked too bad against Max. I think the problem with Frankie — and I watched this in his post-fight interviews after Max — he looked really broken and confused as to why he wasn’t winning anymore. He was kind of looking for a solution."</blockquote>
      <p>He showed his respect to Edgar and all his accomplishments in his career but said that it's someone else's time now. He got the feeling after his interview post-UFC 240 that he should retire.</p>
