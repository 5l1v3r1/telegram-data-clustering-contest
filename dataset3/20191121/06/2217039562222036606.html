        <b>LONDON : Twitter said yesterday that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party misled the public by changing the name of one of its Twitter accounts to make it look like a fact-checking service during a televised election debate.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Conservative Campaign Headquarters press office account, followed by nearly 76,000 users, changed its name to "factcheckUK" from its usual "CCHQPress" and switched its avatar to a white tick against a purple background.</p>
      <p>It made the change while Mr Johnson was debating Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn on live television.</p>
      <p>The rebranded account tweeted graphics supporting statements from Mr Johnson as "True" and criticised others from Mr Corbyn.</p>
      <p>"Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election," a Twitter spokesman said.</p>
      <p>"We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action."</p>
      <p>Full Fact, a genuine fact-checking charity, also criticised the Conservative tactic.</p>
      <p>"It is inappropriate and misleading for the Conservative press office to rename their Twitter account 'factcheckUK' during this debate. Please do not mistake it for an independent fact checking service," it said.</p>
      <p>Labour said it was a "scam" that showed the Conservatives could not be trusted in government. However, Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly defended the move.</p>
      <p>"We made it absolutely clear it is a Conservative Party website... checking the claims" of Mr Corbyn, he said.</p>
      <p>The account description during the debate was "Fact Checking Labour from CCHQ". After the debate finished the account reverted to its regular Conservative Party branding.</p>
      <p>Prior to the controversy, Twitter had pledged to make it easier to report misleading information about the voting process in Britain's Dec 12 election.</p>
      <p>It also said last month it would stop all political advertising, making the British election one of the first major tests for the new policy. - REUTERS</p>
