      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> was adjourned on Thursday till noon as opposition parties including the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Congress">Congress</a> protested after the Chair did not allow discussion on the issue of electoral bonds and privatisation of state-owned firms.</p>
      <p>Soon after laying of listed papers by ministers on the table of the House, Chairman M <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Venkaiah-Naidu">Venkaiah Naidu</a> said he has received notices from several members to suspend business and take up discussions on the RBI's objection to electoral bonds, and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/disinvestment">disinvestment</a> of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/PSUs">PSUs</a>.</p>
      <p>"They (the notices) do not warrant suspension of other business and (notices) taken upon priority," he said.</p>
      <p>However, Congress members were on their feet and held protests.</p>
      <p>Naidu said it was the prerogative of the Chair to decide which discussions should be taken or not.</p>
      <p>This did not pacify the protesting Congress and other opposition party members.</p>
      <p>Naidu then adjourned the House till noon.</p>
