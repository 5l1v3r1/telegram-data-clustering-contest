      <p>If you haven’t yet heard about Bear, the koala detection dog, stop what you are doing and get ready for your heart to explode.</p>
      <p>Bear — hardworking doggo and national treasure — is going viral for his work rescuing injured koalas caught up in our catastrophic bushfires.</p>

      <p>More than a million hectares of bush has been destroyed across Australia’s east coast so far, with hundreds of koalas feared dead.</p>
      <p>Bear’s special skills have seen him deployed to the frontlines of the Sunshine Coast’s bushfire disaster, where some of Australia’s most genetically diverse koalas live.</p>

      <p>And in case you missed it, take a look at the adorable little booties he wears to protect his paws from the burnt ground.</p>

      <p>Usually, Bear is used to track down live animals for conservation and research purposes. Most dogs in his line of work are used to detect koala droppings, but Bear is special — he’s the only dog in the country trained to detect live animals.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately the thing that made him such a brilliant detection dog also made him a terrible pet, with his previous owners giving him up after he literally ate their apartment.</p>
      <p>Luckily his talents were recognised and he was picked up by trainers with the <a href="https://www.usc.edu.au/research-and-innovation/animal-and-marine-ecology/detection-dogs-for-conservation/more-about-detection-dogs">Detection Dogs for Conservation</a> program. The program is run through University of the Sunshine Coast and sponsored by the International Fund for Animal Welfare.</p>

      <p>Koalas are a vulnerable species with habitat loss one of their biggest threats, so the bushfires have been particularly damaging.</p>
      <p>Today koala experts met in Brisbane to discuss ways to help the animals, with $3 million available for habitat restoration.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the internet has fallen in love with Bear and his booties.</p>
