      <p>Former Sooner Bobby Evans got his big opportunity in the NFL on Sunday night, and he took advantage of it.</p>
      <p>Evans started at tackle on the Los Angeles Rams' offensive line against the Chicago Bears, replacing the injured Rob Havenstein.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma offensive line coach Bill Bedenbaugh said he didn't get to watch much of the game, but thought Evans did a good job, especially going up against the Bears' defense and guys like linebacker Khalil Mack.</p>
      <p>"The little bit I saw, I thought he looked really good," Bedenbaugh said. "I thought he did a heck of a job."</p>
      <p>Evans had a breakout performance, helping the Rams beat the Bears 17-7. Los Angeles' offense ran for 110 yards, and quarterback Jared Goff threw for 173 yards.</p>
      <p>Fellow Ram and former Oklahoma teammate Ogbonnia Okoronkwo was excited for Evans.</p>
      <p>"I was so happy for Bobby. This whole week, me and him talked about this game." Okoronkwo said in an interview posted by the Rams after the game. "He was really excited. He was a little anxious but in a good way. It was just good to see him get out there and do his thing."</p>
      <p>Bedenbaugh said Evans and the other recent graduates of Oklahoma's offensive line will be good players when they get their opportunities like Evans got Sunday.</p>
      <p>They are all going to be like their former teammate and current Baltimore Ravens' lineman Orlando Brown, Bedenbaugh said.</p>
      <p>"The future of those guys is really bright because they are going to continue to develop," Bedenbaugh said.</p>

        <b>Sooners' offense got rolling after change on O-line</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oklahoma's offensive line made a change against Baylor on Saturday.</p>
      <p>During the first half, R.J. Proctor replaced Erik Swenson at left tackle. A redshirt junior, Swenson has played in every game this season.</p>
      <p>Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said the switch was planned because the coaches wanted to give Proctor some playing time. After struggling at the start, the line, much like the rest of the offense, began to click in late in the second quarter.</p>
      <p>"Eric was fine. We had planned the whole time to play R.J. We thought he’d earned the right to play him some," Riley said. "As R.J. got in there, thought he was playing well and gave him a couple series and then we started to kind of settle a little and got on a roll and so we ended up just leaving him (in)."</p>
      <p>A redshirt senior, Proctor came to OU as a graduate transfer from Virginia. He started six games in three seasons at Virginia.</p>
      <p>"He stayed extremely positive through playing some and then not playing some and some of the back and forth," Riley said. "He’s worked hard at it and put himself in position to really contribute a lot at the end of the season."</p>
