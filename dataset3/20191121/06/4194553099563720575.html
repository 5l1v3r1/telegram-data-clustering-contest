      <p>A clip is making Liverpool fans go berserk on Twitter right now that shows Gerard Pique’s wife Shakira losing the plot during our 4-0 victory over Barcelona last season.</p>
      <p>A programme about Barcelona’s season is coming out soon, that will show inside the dressing room footage from Anfield that famous night – but the not-yet released documentary also went to film the players’ partners as they watched the game on the TV.</p>
      <p>Shakira is sat with her two young sons, one of which is explaining that Barca will still go through with the score at 2-0…</p>
      <p>Then Gini Wijnaldum scores his epic header and Shakira’s tantrum begins!</p>
      <p>We absolutely cannot wait to watch this for real. Bring it on!</p>
