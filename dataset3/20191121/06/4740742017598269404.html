      <p>Ex-<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-transcript-nottingham-forest-3555566">Bristol City</a> forward Aaron Wilbraham has spoken about the time he and Lee Johnson were 'screaming in each other's faces' in the manager's office.</p>
      <p>In a tell-all podcast for Undr the Cosh, Wilbraham has spoken about life at City, his relationship with the Robins boss much more.</p>
      <p>He was a big favourite at Ashton Gate, helping City achieve promotion to the Championship in 2014/15 and going on to captain the side.</p>
      <p>He won the League One title and the EFL Trophy while winning the hearts of City fans.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aaron-wilbraham-how-crackers-lee-3556498">In the podcast, Wilbraham describes</a> a time he and Johnson fell out over the actions of his agent towards academy graduate Joe Bryan.</p>
      <p>Johnson wasn't happy with the way Wilbraham facilitated a chat between the two, and accused him of 'touting' the youngster.</p>
      <p>Wilbraham said he Johnson got into a heated exchange over the situation, but did admit that he was a 'good coach'.</p>

      <p>Johnson joined City in 2016, the year before Wilbraham left the club.</p>
      <p>In the podcast, Wilbraham said: "He's another manager who is younger than me. He was probably a little bit wary.</p>
      <p>"He's alright. I had a few arguments, we clashed a few times over stupid little things.</p>
      <p>"My agent wanted to have a chat with Joe Bryan. He said to me 'you've got Brentford away tomorrow night, you're in the hotel, IÂ  might come down and have a chat with Joe'.</p>
      <p>"I said to Will (the agent), don't do that the day before a game, managers don't like that. He said alright but said to ask Joe if he was interested.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to Joe myself and said Will wants a chat. Joe said potentially, when it's the right time.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't touting him up, I'm not getting anything if he wants to have a chat with my agent."</p>
      <p>Wilbraham said his agent tried to have a chat with Joe at a later game.</p>
      <p>He said: "We played Cardiff away and my agent was at the game and said he'd have a chat with Joe after.</p>
      <p>"We were getting on the bus after the game and my agent walked up to Joe and had a five minute chat.</p>
      <p>"We get back to the training ground and Johnson said he wants a word. He's fuming because we've been beaten.</p>
      <p>"He told me the club pays me a lot of money to play football, not to tout our young lads to agents.</p>
      <p>"I said: 'Hang on gaffer. I'm with Will, you know him. He's asked me if he can come to Brentford last week and I've said no, because you won't like it. I've been professional enough to say no'.</p>

      <p>"I said: 'What can I do if he's at the Cardiff game and he just wants to have a chat with Joe'?</p>
      <p>"Johnson said Joe had told his (current) agent, and now his agent was ringing the chief executive and the chief exec was going at him (Johnson).</p>
      <p>"Joe ended up bringing me a bottle of champagne the next day saying he had stitched me up. I said it was alright.</p>
      <p>"You get agents like that. I fell out with Johnson over that, we were screaming in each other's faces in his office.</p>
      <p>"We had a few blow outs but we were fine. A lot of people found him a bit arrogant but he was a good coach."</p>
