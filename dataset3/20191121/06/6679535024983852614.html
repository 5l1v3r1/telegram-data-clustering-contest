      <p>Border patrol agents pursued and apprehended the driver and the five Indian nationals who do not have immigration documentation allowing them to remain in the U.S. legally. All persons were taken into custody and transported to the Ogdensburg Border Patrol Station.</p>
      <p>The criminal case was referred to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of New York.</p>
