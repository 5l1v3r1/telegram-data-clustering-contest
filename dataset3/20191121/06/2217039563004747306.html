        <b>The woman who allegedly scalded her five-year-old son to death had allegedly been abused as a child and also by her husband, the court heard yesterday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Azlin Arujunah, and her husband, Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman, both 27, are on trial for allegedly scalding their son to death.</p>
      <p>He died in October 2016 after collapsing from having hot water poured on him by Ridzuan.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, investigating officer Mahathir Mohamad, an Assistant Superintendent at the special investigation section of the Criminal Investigation Department, read out the statements he had taken from Azlin.</p>
      <p>In a statement taken on Nov 8, 2016, Azlin had said: "Like I said, there was no one to guide me. My whole life is filled with violence.</p>
      <p>"I myself was a victim of hot water splashing by my parents. My husband also assaulted me so I kept it all inside me.</p>
      <p>"When (the victim) was stubborn, I let it all out on (him)."</p>
      <h3>LOST HER OTHER KIDS</h3>
      <p>Azlin also said she regretted what she had done to the victim and asked to be given a chance to make amends, as she had "lost (her) other children" due to the incident.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Azlin's defence lawyer Thangavelu, who goes by only one name, said she had lived with her grandmother, and when her grandmother died, the loss was unbearable to her.</p>
      <p>She then tried to repair her relationship with her mother, but her mother died shortly after her grandmother's death.</p>
      <p>The court heard that Azlin had lodged a police report against Ridzuan in 2010 for punching her in the stomach and in the head.</p>
      <p>Police also received calls of domestic dispute in 2015 and 2016 from Ridzuan's uncle and an unknown caller.</p>
      <p>There were no medical records of the alleged assault.</p>
      <p>ASP Mahathir also said that Azlin had told him if she spoke the truth, her husband would be taken away from her.</p>
      <p>But she later revealed that Ridzuan had splashed hot water on the victim a day before his death.</p>
      <p>After Ridzuan was arrested, he told police that Azlin had also splashed hot water on the boy.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
