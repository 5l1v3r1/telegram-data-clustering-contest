      <p>There are no two ways about how talented an actress Kriti Sanon is. Not only has she worked in some amazing big banner films, but the actress has also shared screen space with some superstars in Bollywood. </p>
      <p>Kriti Sanon has been riding high on success of films like Bareilly Ki Barfi, Luka Chuppi. Even her roles are getting meatier by the day. Now, speaking of her forthcoming film Bachchan Pandey, <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/bachchan-pandey-akshay-kumar-starrer-gets-it-s-leading-lady-kriti-sanon-teams-up-with-the-actor-once-again/5dcb905487fb571eff7e3c5c">she will be seen playing the female lead opposite Akshay Kumar</a>.</p>

      <p>Yet again, Kriti has a very integral part to play. She is not just a mere prop or a glam doll in the film. But, this is endorsed by Bachchan Pandey director Farhad Samji who says, “I can say this without any qualms that Kriti’s role in the film is better than a parallel hero role. It’s a very meaty role, in fact any actress wouldn’t have gotten such a role, it is that good. “</p>
