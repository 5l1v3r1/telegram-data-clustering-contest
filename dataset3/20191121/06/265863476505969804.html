      <h1>50 Cent: Here’s Why He Deleted His Instagram Account – Is He Finally Done Trolling People?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:45:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:45</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>The rapper just deleted his Instagram for no apparent reason and fans were pretty surprised, to say the least! The reason why everyone was shocked 50 Cent deactivated his account was that it had pretty much been the platform on which he’d started drama with many people for years!</p>
      <p>It’s no secret that 50 loves to troll his enemies perhaps more than any other public person and never holds back his creative insults.</p>
      <p>That being said, he used to feud with whoever bothered him on Instagram but now that he doesn’t have that page anymore, is he also done with the trolling?</p>
      <p>People will just have to wait and see but still, the question remains – why did the king of Instagram trolling deactivate his account?</p>
      <p>50 relocated to his Twitter, for the time being, reposting an article that claimed the page was actually closed down by Instagram due to his rude comments about Power star Naturi Naughton.</p>
      <p>‘LOL I’m cool with all these false reports, if you don’t know why something happens you can’t just make some sh*t up smh I turned my own IG page off SUCKERS. I like twitter better than IG right now follow me over here,’ he tweeted about the speculations.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, one source tells HollywoodLife that ‘50 Cent thinks it’s hilarious that so many people believe his Instagram account was disabled when that couldn’t be further from the truth. 50 deactivated his own account because he wanted to take a break from Instagram, simple as that. Some people believe his account was disabled because they thought he trolled Naturi Naughton, but 50 was actually defending her against the trolls.’</p>
      <p>They went on to mention that even if he did troll her, he did not believe that was worse than many other things he’d said about other people.</p>
      <p>The rapper supposedly drags other stars online because he thinks his fans are entertained by it.</p>
      <p>That being said, Instagram was a very good outlet for that ‘but in the meantime, he’s just using Twitter.’</p>
