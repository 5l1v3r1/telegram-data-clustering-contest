      <p>Men are more likely than women to believe there are certain situations in which cheating on your partner is acceptable, a new BBC study has revealed. </p>
      <p>In general, 83 per cent of adults in the UK agreed they felt a “significant” responsibility to be faithful to their partner. </p>
      <p>Yet when it came to those who believed it was “never” acceptable to cheat on their other half, there was a clear gender gap, with 80 per cent of women questioned agreeing with the statement, compared to 64 per cent of men. </p>
      <p>Additionally, it emerged during the course of the BBC’s research that not everyone practices what they preach - at least three in five of those adults who say it is never acceptable to be adulterous have also cheated on their partner.</p>
      <p>The findings came as part of a wider survey conducted by the broadcaster in order to offer an insight into the UK’s ‘moral framework’ in 2019.</p>
      <p>More than 3,000 adults aged 16 and over were questioned on their values and morals in relation to issues like the environment, tolerance and immigration. </p>
      <p>The results showed a divide between attitudes held by older and younger generations on political topics such as migration and climate change. </p>
      <p>Those over 55 years old were overwhelmingly in favour of limits on migration to the UK, with 72 per cent backing the idea, despite a recent<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-50283423?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/c302m85qe1vt/uk-immigration&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story"> Foreign Affairs Committee report</a> advising the government that strict border controls drive vulnerable migrants into the hands of smugglers.</p>
      <p>In contrast, 56 per cent of 16 to 34 year olds believed the UK has a duty to welcome those from less fortunate circumstances into the country, with a further 53 per cent also adding that migrants should have access to the NHS.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly, it was older individuals who also expressed the most concern about climate change, with more of those aged 55+ saying they felt a “significant” responsibility to protect the planet for generations to come.</p>
      <p>Young people were far more likely to buy fast fashion and single use items, although they were also more likely to follow a plant-based diet. </p>
