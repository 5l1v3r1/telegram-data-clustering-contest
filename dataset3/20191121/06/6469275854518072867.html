        <b>A £30,000 fundraising appeal has been launched to enable Garstang School of Gymnastics to take its next step.</b>
      </p>
      <p>An appeal for a new floor has been launched to enable talented pupils at the school to “achieve their potential”.</p>
      <p>Club spokeswoman Isobel Riley who has set up a special GoFundMe page on behalf of the school’s fundraising committee, says the floor is much needed so gymnasts can “train to their maximum”.</p>
      <p>She continued: “A new floor is key for all our gymnasts in their training and by far the most expensive piece of equipment to buy for a club.”</p>
      <p>A target date of next April has been set to raise the funds for the Longmoor Lane facility at Nateby, on the outskirts of Garstang.</p>
      <p>Now Isobel is appealing to supporters to spread the word that donations are welcome.</p>
      <p>The school trains gymnasts at all levels from those competing at club and elite levels on regional, national and international stages to pupils attending the school for recreation.</p>
      <p>Isobel said: “Our gymnasts train hard all year round; the club is an amazing asset for community providing a place for young people to push their limits, learn new skills and develop confidence. "</p>
