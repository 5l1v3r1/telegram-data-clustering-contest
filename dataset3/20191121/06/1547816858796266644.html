        <b>The first full picture of Angad Bedi and Neha Dhupia’s baby girl Mehr has been disclosed by grandpa Bishan Bedi and she’s every bit adorable!</b>
      </p>
      <p>All this while, lovebirds Neha Dhupia and Angad Bedi were trying their best to hide their precious baby girl Mehr from the public eye, so much so, that they have been only sharing pictures of her back and side shots. However, their hard work seems to have now gone in vain courtesy, Angad Bedi’s father and former cricketer, Bishan Bedi. And, are we surprised here? It’s her loving grandfather after all! LOL! It all happened after Neha and Angad visited Bishan’s ancestral house on the occasion of Mehr’s first birthday.</p>
      <p>Taking to his social media, the former Indian cricketer shared a glimpse from their outing and, there we go, there’s a full-fledged picture of his munchkin Mehr as well. The picture sees mommy-daddy Angad and Neha posing with their baby girl and the trio were all smiles. Needless to say, Mehr looked every bit adorable. In his caption, Bishan expressed his elation on the same, he wrote, “MEHR seems to approve of her presence in the dilapidated ‘Haveli’ of her Great GrandParents..Maybe the renovation of the Old Relic is around the corner..!! Thx Fellas for visiting my Birth Place..Guru MEHR Kareh..Love All Always..Hope U all left behind yur Youthful Energies..!!”</p>
