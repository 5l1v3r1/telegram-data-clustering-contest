      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Emergency personnel responded to two separate crashes involving mopeds on Oahu on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A 55-year-old moped rider was critically injured after he apparently lost control and hit the pavement, Emergency Medical Services said.</p>
      <p>The moped rider was traveling east on a bike path behind Leeward Community College when the crash happened around 2:20 p.m.</p>
      <p>Police said the man, who was not wearing a helmet, suffered injuries to his head.</p>
      <p>Speed is believed to be a factor in the crash.</p>
      <p>Later that night, a 58-year-old man on a moped was found unresponsive on the North Shore.</p>
      <p>He was discovered on the side of the road around 10 p.m. near the intersection of Kamehameha Highway and Pupukea Road.</p>
