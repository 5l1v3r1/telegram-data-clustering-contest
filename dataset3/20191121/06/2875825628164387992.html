      <h1>Slovakia believe they've drawn the toughest possible play-off in Ireland</h1>
      <h2>They host Mick McCarthy’s Ireland on March 26 in a one-off semi-final</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Slovakia reckon they have landed the toughest playoff draw possible.</p>
      <p>They host Mick McCarthy’s Ireland on March 26 in a one-off semi-final with the winner facing Northern Ireland or Bosnia in a final five days later.</p>
      <p>A draw will take place in Switzerland tomorrow to determine who is at home in that decider.</p>
      <p>Slovakia finished third in their qualifying group behind Croatia and Wales and closed out with a 2-0 home win over Azerbaijan on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>They only finished a point behind Wales and Slovakia boss Pavel Hapal has bemoaned last month’s home draw with Ryan Giggs’ side.</p>
      <p>Skipper Marek Hamsik, the long-time Napoli stalwart who is now with Dalian Yifang in China, knows Slovakia have a tough test on their hands.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pity we didn’t qualify automatically but we have to get our heads up to play Ireland,” he said.</p>
      <p>“For the playoff, it’s important that we’re all playing regularly for our clubs.”</p>
      <p>Hertha Berlin defender Peter Pekarík said: “We’ll be disappointed for a few days that we didn’t qualify automatically but our problem was drawing at home with Wales.</p>
      <p>“We have another chance in the playoff but I watched Ireland’s game against Denmark and they played very well - they are a really tough opponent.”</p>
      <p>Slovakia boss Hapal claims his side is in transition but insists his players will be fired up for the playoff.</p>
      <p>Hapal said: “The team is young and we’re rebuilding but there is quality there. The players will be well prepared for a playoff.</p>
      <p>“We’ve a positive atmosphere in the team and we’re gaining valuable experience all the time.”</p>
