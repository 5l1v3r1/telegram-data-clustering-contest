      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After a nasty decline, bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/20/bitcoin-btc-price-primed-for-breakdown-below-8k/">found support near the $8,000 level</a> against the US Dollar. BTC traded as low as $7,990 and it is currently consolidating losses well below the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>There was a corrective wave above the $8,080 and $8,100 levels. Moreover, the price spiked above the $8,150 resistance level. Though, the price struggled to stay above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $8,630 high to $7,990 low.</p>
      <p>At the outset, the price is trading near $8,100, with an immediate resistance near the $8,150 level. Additionally, the next key resistance is near the $8,200 and $8,220 levels, above which bitcoin could test the $8,300 resistance area.</p>
      <p>An intermediate resistance is near the $8,280 level and the 100 hourly simple moving average. To move into a positive zone, the price must settle above the $8,300 resistance and the 100 hourly SMA.</p>
      <p>Besides, the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $8,630 high to $7,990 low is also near the $8,310 level to act as a resistance.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price could struggle to climb above the $8,150 and $8,220 resistance levels. On the downside, an initial support is near the $8,060 level. More importantly, there is a key rising channel or a bearish flag pattern forming with support near $8,060 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a downside break below the channel support near $8,060 will most likely push the price further lower. Finally, a bearish break below the $8,000 support area could open the doors for a drop towards the $7,400 support area (the next bearish target as discussed in the recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/19/bitcoin-medium-term-outlook-here-is-why-btc-could-test-6-5k/">medium term outlook</a>).</p>
