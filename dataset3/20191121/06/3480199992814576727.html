      <p>The election to fill a spot for Market Drayton Town Council's North ward will take place on December 5, seven days before the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>The Beacon Community Centre will be the polling station, with voting allowed between 7am and 10pm.</p>
      <p>Two candidates are in the running; Rob Bentley of the Labour Party and David Minnery, who is standing as an independent candidate.</p>
      <p>Mr Minnery holds a cabinet role on Shropshire Council as a Conservative but said he has been cleared to run as an independent by the North Shropshire Conservatives in a bid to de-politicise town council matters.</p>
