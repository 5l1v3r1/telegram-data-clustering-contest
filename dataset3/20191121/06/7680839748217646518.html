        <li>Former Disney star Brenda Song, who played the wealthy teen London Tipton in “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” said she wasn’t given the opportunity to audition for the 2018 romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians.”</li>
        <li>In an interview with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/brenda-song-dollface">Teen Vogue</a>, the actress said she asked her managers if she could get an audition for any part in the movie, but instead, she was told her image was “basically not Asian enough.”</li>
        <li>Song isn’t the first Asian American in Hollywood who has said their “Asian-ness” was questioned. “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before” star Lana Condor said in an <a href="https://www.insider.com/lana-condor-had-the-perfect-response-to-claims-that-shes-not-asian-enough-2018-11">interview</a> that she was often not seen as “Asian enough” because she was adopted by white parents.</li>

      <p>Former Disney star Brenda Song, who played the wealthy teen London Tipton in “The Suite Life of Zack and Cody,” was dubbed the original “Crazy Rich Asian” by the internet akin to the 2018 romantic comedy “Crazy Rich Asians.”</p>
      <p>But Song said she wasn’t even given the opportunity to audition.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/brenda-song-dollface">Teen Vogue</a>, the actress said she asked her managers if she could get an audition for any part in the movie, but instead of reading for a part, Song said she was met with heartbreak.</p>
      <p>“Their reasoning behind that, what they said was that my image was basically not Asian enough, in not so many words,” Song told Teen Vogue. “It broke my heart.”</p>
      <p>Song, who was born to Thai-American and Hmong parents, told Teen Vogue that she believed she fit the role being an Asian American in her mid- to late-20s.</p>
      <p>“I said, ‘This character is in her late to mid-20s, an Asian American, and I can’t even audition for it?” Song said. “I’ve auditioned for Caucasian roles my entire career, but this specific role, you’re not going to let me do it? You’re going to fault me for having worked my whole life?'”</p>
      <p>“I was like, ‘Where do I fit?'” she continued.</p>
      <p>But the director of “Crazy Rich Asians,” Jon M. Chu, weighed in on Song’s comments on Wednesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonmchu/status/1197274496446664704">tweeting</a> that he felt “horrible” about Song’s interpretation of the incident.</p>
      <p>“[W]ould these words ever come out of my mouth? Nope makes no sense. I feel horrible she thinks this is the reason,” Chu wrote. “The fact is I love Brenda Song and am a fan. I didn’t need her to audition because I already knew who she was!”</p>
      <p>Song isn’t the first Asian American in Hollywood who has said their “Asian-ness” has been questioned. “To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before” star Lana Condor said in an <a href="https://www.insider.com/lana-condor-had-the-perfect-response-to-claims-that-shes-not-asian-enough-2018-11">interview</a> that she was often not seen as “Asian enough” because she was adopted by white parents. The Netflix star, who was adopted from Vietnam, was cast to play Lara Jean Covey, a half-Korean character in the film.</p>
      <p>“I’m 100 percent Asian, and I’m also 100 percent American,” Condor said in the interview with Who What Wear. “That’s something that I’m really trying to let people understand. My Asian American experience is different from someone else’s Asian American experience, and that’s OK. There are moments when I feel that people don’t think that I’m Asian enough because I was adopted by an American family. To me, that’s so silly!”</p>
