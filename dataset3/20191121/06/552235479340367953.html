      <h1>Hibs sporting director Graeme Mathie reveals what Jack Ross was asked during recruitment process</h1>
      <h2>The club honed in specific aspects of Ross' work at Sunderland and liked what they heard enough to make him their new boss</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Hibs’ sporting director Graeme Mathie has outlined exactly what questions <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> answered in order to convince the club he was the man to become their new head coach.</p>
      <p>Ross was appointed as Paul Heckingbottom’s successor on a long-term contract last week.</p>
      <p>He began work on Monday before speaking to the assembled media at Easter Road, and has since been preparing to take charge of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> for the first time at home to Motherwell this Saturday.</p>
      <p>The recruitment process was relatively swift, but that’s not to say it was an easy choice. Mathie and chief executive <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leeann-dempster">Leeann Dempster</a> spoke with other candidates, but the decision to appoint Ross was “unanimous” with owner Ron Gordon giving the former St Mirren man his backing as well.</p>
      <p>All clubs maintain their recruitment processes are robust and well thought out, but Mathie provided extra detail on what that process looked like for the Leith club.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It was important to say that no-one gets the Hibs job based on a good interview or PowerPoint presentation,” he said. “It should give Jack a lot of comfort that the process was as rigorous as it was because, after that, he was the outstanding candidate.</p>
      <p>“A lot of the work we did before meeting Jack was internal. There were a number of staff members involved, particularly Calvin Charlton, our head of performance analysis, who pulled together a huge amount of information to give us context to all of the guys on our shortlist.</p>
      <p>“By the time we were sitting in front of them we were able to ask specific questions and really dig in on questions their previous work might have raised.</p>
      <p>“In Jack's case, that meant looking at the different support structures he had worked with at his different clubs, what he needed to be successful and challenging some of the things that work showed up.</p>

      <p>“One of the things we wanted to do was not just find the right candidate for us, but make sure the club is the right fit for the successful applicant. We believe we are as good a fit for Jack as he is for us”</p>
      <p>While Ross’ reputation north of the border remains in tact after the work he did in charge of Alloa and then St Mirren, failure to get Sunderland out of League One and back in to the Championship, despite the comparative resources available to him, is valid.</p>
      <p>Mathie however, was keen to look beyond just the money available to Ross.</p>
      <p>He explained: “A lot is said about Jack having the biggest budget in League One, which is true, but you have to dig deeper and realise that he was attempting to transition players on League One salaries into a dressing room with others earning Premier League wages. That's a challenge. He is trying to get them to be part of a team and work together.</p>
      <p>“That came across; his ability to manage individuals and get the best out of them.</p>
      <p>“We are a club looking to transition through young players, which he has done. He has picked the right time to bring through young players at his previous clubs and actually brought about sales.</p>
      <p>“Other aspects were his ability to change shape and formation to adapt to the teams and players he was up against. There's his ability to turn draws into wins with positive substitutions.</p>
      <p>“All these things were part of our thinking and we had all that information before we met him.”</p>
      <p>There has also been criticism of Mathie himself from the Hibs fans after the business done over the summer.</p>

      <p>Paul Heckingbottom added ten players to his squad, nine of which were his picks after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scott-allan">Scott Allan</a> had already agreed to return from Celtic.</p>
      <p>For the most part, supporters have been underwhelmed by the impact made so far and as head of recruitment when they were signed, Mathie’s role has came under scrutiny.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> scout accepts that as being part of the job, but pointed out that in football especially, snap judgements are made on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>"The unfortunate thing in this game is that you get an appraisal sometimes three times a week," he said. "If a performance is positive and a result is positive, life's good, recruitment's great, the coaching's brilliant. If it goes the other way, it's the opposite. That's the game we're in.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"I've been in it long enough to know you don't pay your mortgage working in football. You're mad to do that. That's just what it is. You're judged every week.</p>
      <p>"Some of the criticism over the summer, we take it on the chin. We believe the players are good players.</p>
      <p>"We wanted to do a number of things with the recruitment; balance the age profile within the squad, have better control of contracts to try and gave fewer loans and short term deals.</p>
      <p>"Within that you need to make decisions. That's what we're here to do and what we'll be judged on, so we accept it."</p>
