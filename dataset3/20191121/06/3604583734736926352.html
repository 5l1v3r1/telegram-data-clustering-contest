      <p>This is the message appearance activist Carly Findlay hopes emerging leaders will share with Ballarat.</p>
      <p>As a blogger, writer, speaker and appearance activist, Ms Findlay is challenging community thinking about what it is like to have a visibly different appearance.</p>
      <p>She shared her personal stories and messages of advocacy with participants of the Leadership Ballarat and Western Region program and Committee for Ballarat members on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <blockquote>When disabled people make up 20 per cent of the population we should have input into policy, education, employment and all community issues, not just about disability.<cite>Carly Findlay</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The talk was a part of the In Conversation series, presented as a one on one interview with former City of Ballarat councillor Judy Verlin.</p>
      <p>"The workforce should represent 20 per cent of the disability population," Ms Findlay told <i>The Courier </i>after speaking as part of the series.</p>
      <p>"Go out and see disability arts, buy books written by writers with a disability, watch disability sport - make sure that disability features in your life."</p>
      <p>Ms Findlay conveyed the messages portrayed in her new book <i>Say Hello, </i>including the need for community acceptance and positivity around disability to enable self-love.</p>
      <p>"I never identified as disabled as a child so I didn't know how to ask for what I needed. Once you know your identity you can advocate for yourself," she said.</p>
      <p>"There was never this kind of self acceptance there as a child because they (my community) wanted me to change."</p>
      <p>Ms Findlay writes on disability issues for publications including ABC, Daily Life and SBS and her personal blog.</p>
      <p>Her advocacy lead to her naming as one of Australia's most influential women in the 2014 100 Women of Influence Awards.</p>
      <p>Ms Findlay will also speak at the Committee for Ballarat's Round Table Dinner at the Mercure Hotel on Thursday night, where Leadership Ballarat and Western Victoria 2019 participants will graduate from the program.</p>
      <p>There her talk will focus on making space for people with a disability at the table making decisions about the whole community on a local and national level.</p>
      <p>"When disabled people make up 20 per cent of the population we should have input into policy, education, employment and all community issues, not just about disability. We are more than that," Ms Findlay told <i>The Courier</i>.</p>
      <p>Ms Findlay's talk was the final part of the In Conversation series, following a conversation with philanthropist and Ballarat identity Paula Nicholson in September and celebrated female football pioneer Peta Searle in October.</p>
      <p>"The purpose of the In Conversation series was to talk about stories of leadership, because stories create connection and impact," Leadership Ballarat Western Region executive officer Michelle Whyte said.</p>
      <p>"We hope people feel inspired and realise their own potential."</p>
