      <h1>Mohamed Elyounoussi identifies the Celtic star who sold him on Hoops switch</h1>
      <h2>The Norwegian winger moved on loan from Southampton in the summer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Loan star Mo Elyounoussi has revealed <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/stuart-armstrong">Stuart Armstrong</a> was intrumental in selling him on Celtic.</p>
      <p>The flying winger joined the Scottish champions from Southampton on a season-long deal in the summer transfer window.</p>
      <p>After being sidelined by Saints boss Ralph Hasselhuttl he has recaptured the form that prompted the English Premier League club to pay £16million to lure him to St Mary’s from Basel.</p>
      <p>Now Elyounoussi has lifted the lid on why he chose <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> – and it was on the recommendation of Armstrong.</p>

      <p>Despite the fact the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> midfielder hotfooted it out of Celtic Park in the summer of 2018, he still had nothing but good things to say to the Norwegian about the Hoops.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/mohamed-elyounoussi">Elyounoussi</a>, who has been named Ladbrokes player of the month for October, said: “I spoke to Stuart, of course, as we’re team mates at Southampton and he was able to tell me things that I didn’t know about the club.</p>
      <p>“He told me so many good things about Celtic. And it was perfect that he sat next to me in the Southampton training ground dressing room.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I had also spoken with Kris Ajer about Celtic too so I had a good knowledge of what I was coming into.</p>

      <p>“I didn’t look at it as a step down, going from the English Premier League to the Scottish Premiership.</p>
      <p>“I needed to get game time. I needed to get minutes on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I feel Celtic have brought my confidence back. I’m scoring goals and I’m really happy.</p>
      <p>“I expected to do well. I came up here to help the team to create chances and score goals to help them win games.</p>
      <p>“So, I’m not surprised. I know the quality I have and I think the manager knows that as well.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“So, with his belief and trust in me and the help of the coaches too I feel I am bringing what I can to the team.</p>
      <p>“I’ve scored seven goals so far and I’m happy with that but I feel I could have scored even more.”</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi caused anxiety when he was sent home by the Norwegian national team with an injury last week – especially with a League Cup Final against Rangers coming up on December 8.</p>
      <p>However, he has revealed that it’s a small knock on his foot. He is a doubt for Livingston on Saturday and might not be risked but should be ready for Rennes in the Europa League next week.</p>

      <p>The 25-year-old, who seven goals and five assists, said: “I actually picked up the injury a couple of weeks ago against Hibs in the League Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>“Then I had to go with the national team and it didn’t really have enough time to heal.</p>
      <p>“So we had a look at it and it was decided I needed a rest. But I think it will be all right.</p>
      <p>“The League Cup Final is a chance to win some silverware early in the season and I can’t wait for this game.</p>

      <p>“I watched the first Old Firm game of the season and the atmosphere was amazing.</p>
      <p>“It’s something I really want to experience so I’m really looking forward to this game.”</p>
      <p>Of course, Scotland could meet Norway in a winner takes all showdown for a place at Euro 2020 with Ajer and Elyounoussi on one side and Callum McGregor, James Forrest and Ryan Christie on the other</p>
      <p>He added: “It would be amazing if Norway was to play Scotland for a place at Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already been talking about that among the boys at Celtic.</p>
      <p>“But we need to beat Serbia first in our semi-final and then see what happens.”</p>
