        <b>NCAA clears Memphis freshman Wiseman to return on Jan. 12</b>
      </p>
      <p>The NCAA has cleared heralded freshman James Wiseman to return to the basketball court on Jan. 12.</p>
      <p>Wiseman will sit out a total of 12 games under a decision announced by the NCAA.</p>
      <p>The sports governing body also announced Wednesday that Wiseman must donate $11,500 to charity of his choice to regain his eligibility.</p>
      <p>Wiseman withdrew his lawsuit against the NCAA on Nov. 14 after Memphis played him in the Tigers’ first three games of the season. The 16th-ranked Tigers were 2-1 with the 7-foot-1 center on the court.</p>
      <p>Once Wiseman withdrew his lawsuit, Memphis held him out of a win over Alcorn State while working to resolve his eligibility status with the NCAA.</p>
      <p>The NCAA had ruled Wiseman was “likely ineligible” due to $11,500 coach Penny Hardaway gave to the center’s family for moving expenses from Nashville to Memphis in the summer of 2017. Hardaway was not the Memphis coach at the time.</p>

        <b>Maple Leafs fire coach</b>
      </p>
      <p>The underperforming Toronto Maple Leafs fired coach Mike Babcock on Wednesday and replaced him with Sheldon Keefe.</p>
      <p>Babcock had a record of 9-10-4 this season for the struggling Leafs, who are 0-5-1 in their last six games, including five straight losses in regulation.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ellsbury released by Yankees</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Yankees have given up on Jacoby Ellsbury, cutting the oft-injured outfielder with more than $26 million left in his $153 million, seven-year contract.</p>
      <p>Ellsbury, who has not played since 2017, was released Wednesday to clear a 40-man roster spot as New York added seven players to protect them from next month’s Rule 5 draft.</p>
