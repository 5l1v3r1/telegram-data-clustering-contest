      <p>Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood showed a softer side when meeting a devoted fan.</p>
      <p>The fearsome panellist on the BBC show met a teenage dancer living with conditions affecting her sight.</p>
      <p>Revel Horwood was inspired by the passion and ability of 13-year-old Neve, who idolises the Strictly judge and the show.</p>
      <blockquote>I’m honoured that Neve thinks of me as a hero</blockquote>
      <p>The often merciless critic has taken part in a campaign for the Guide Dogs charity to show that visual impairment should not stand in the way of people achieving their dreams.</p>
      <p>He spoke to Neve at Elstree Studios, talking about Strictly and her own blossoming career on the dance floor.</p>
      <p>The young dancer said: “I absolutely loved meeting Craig. Strictly is the best show on TV and I think Craig is the best judge by far.</p>
      <p>“He has definitely inspired me to keep dancing.”</p>
      <p>Revel Horwood was touched by the meeting, and inspired by the determination of his young fan.</p>

      <p>Neve has used the help of the Guide Dogs charity to develop her movement and orientation skills as she learned how to dance.</p>
      <p>Revel Horwood said: “She is the embodiment of a fabulous dancer.</p>
      <p>“She is talented, resilient and unafraid to try new things, despite having some extra challenges to navigate.</p>
      <p>“I’m honoured that Neve thinks of me as a hero – but I think it’s pretty clear who the real star is here. I can’t wait to follow Neve’s journey and have no doubt she can achieve anything she wants in life, both on and off the dance floor.”</p>
      <p>Revel Horwood and Neve met as part of the Guide Dogs #MeetaHero campaign.</p>
