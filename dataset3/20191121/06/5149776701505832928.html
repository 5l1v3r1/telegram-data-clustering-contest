      <h1>'It’s worked out quite well' - The Nottingham Forest player that has impressed Garry Birtles the most</h1>
      <h2>Former Red Garry Birtles writes exclusively for Nottinghamshire Live</h2>

      <p>As we come towards the end of the international break and look ahead to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>'s trip to Bristol City, I've been mulling over the season to date, and wondered who had been the stand-out performer.</p>
      <p>I think if push came to shove, I’d have to pick Joe Worrall at the moment.</p>
      <p>While some would criticise Scottish football, I feel like his move to Rangers has really been the making of him and now his home town club are reaping the rewards.</p>
      <p>He’s returned a much better player and though Aitor Karanka came under fire for allowing him to leave, you have to say it’s worked out quite well.</p>

      <p>We’ve said before in this column just what an impact he’s had this season alongside Michael Dawson, and he’s been excellent.</p>
      <p>It would be hard to pick out anyone that’s been more consistent than he has so far this season.</p>
      <p>That said, there are numerous other players that deserve a mention, such has been the great start Forest have enjoyed.</p>
      <p>Ben Watson is one that springs to mind.</p>
      <p>His transformation has been stark from where he was just a few months ago, and I’m sure Sabri Lamouchi wouldn’t be without him.</p>
      <p>Then there’s Matty Cash, too, and the goalkeeper Brice Samba.</p>

      <p>Forest have had some really, really good performances thus far and they’ll need that to continue into the busy festive period.</p>
      <p>Team which win promotion are the ones that see their players notch up a seven out of 10 every game, with one or two getting eights and above.</p>
      <p>Up to now, virtually every Forest player has been getting those consistent marks and that’s why they find themselves where they are.</p>
      <p>On the two occasions they’d dropped their standards, defeats have followed.</p>
