      <p>Burna Boy’s album, African Giant was yesterday nominated in the Best World Album category at the next edition of the Grammy Awards slated for January 26, 2020.</p>
      <p>Social media users praised him for his enormous work but a video that surfaced after the nomination is what caught our attention that the spoken prayers of the old play a major role in the lives of the young.</p>
      <p>In the video, it was seen that Burna Boy’s grandfather was praying for him to win a Grammy award and the video we learnt is a video that surfaced a few months ago.</p>
      <p>In the video, the singer’s grandfather prayed for him that his next award is going to be a ‘Grammy Award’ and indeed he’s on the road to winning a Grammy’s.</p>
      <p>His grandpa’s prayer will become a reality should he win that award category.</p>
      <p>Burna Boy’s album, African Giant got nominated in the Best World Album category alongside Altin Gün for Gece, Bokanté &amp; Metropole Orkest Conducted By Jules Buckley for What Heat, Nathalie Joachim With Spektral Quartet for Fanm D’Ayiti, and Angelique Kidjo for Celia.</p>
