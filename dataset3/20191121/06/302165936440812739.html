      <h1>Alleging underperformance, PAS moots Guan Eng as first to go in Cabinet reshuffle</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — DAP’s Lim Guan Eng should be terminated as finance minister in the event of a Cabinet reshuffle, Datuk Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man suggested today.</p>
      <p>The PAS deputy president claimed Lim to be inept in executing his ministerial tasks, holding up Budget 2020 as an example.</p>
      <p>“For example, Penang received a RM10 billion allocation for development but the halal hub only received RM10 million. How many billion is the halal hub market worth?” he told reporters in Parliament.</p>
      <p>The Islamist party leader insisted that developing halal centres nationwide should be given financial priority compared to funding the growth of an entire state.</p>
      <p>The Kubang Kerian MP also accused Lim of failing to balance fund allocations at a regional level. </p>
      <p>“What projects did the East Coast received? Nothing that can jump start the economy. I’m not just talking about Kelantan. Look at Pahang, Terengganu, Sabah and Sarawak.</p>
      <p>“Yes, Sabah and Sarawak received a large allocation for their schools and roadworks but what about big projects to generate the economy?” he asked.</p>
      <p>Tuan Ibrahim claimed Lim to be consistent only when blaming the current money problems faced by the ruling Pakatan Harapan on the previous Barisan Nasional administration.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that it has been nearly two years since a change in the federal administration and said Lim should stop blaming others and instead focus on moving forward.</p>
      <p>He pointed to an online survey indicating that thousands were in favour of Lim’s removal as finance minister. </p>
      <p>Yesterday, Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad said he will consider a Cabinet reshuffle, after several critics suggested that under-performing ministers led to Pakatan Harapan’s loss in Tanjung Piai.</p>
      <p>However, he assured the public that there will be no radical changes before Malaysia hosts the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit scheduled in November next year, as such a drastic change will be problematic.</p>
