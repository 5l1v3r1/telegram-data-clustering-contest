      <h1>Uniflex NFC modules, mini LED substrates to drive 2020 growth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:34:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:34</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Liu, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>IC substrate maker Uniflex Technology expects shipments of NFC (near-field communication) flexible board modules and mini LED substrates to expand significantly, boosting overall revenues and profits for 2020.</p>
      <p>Uniflex's overall performance has improved steadily in the second half of 2019 mainly because the new management at the firm's major production base in China's Yangzhou has managed to expand clientele, enhance product development and boost yield rates for NFC and WPC flexible board modules, according to company president SY Tseng.</p>
      <p>Uniflex landed orders from Samsung for supplying NFC+WPC integration modules for Galaxy S10 series handsets in the first half of 2019, but initially poor yield rates at the Yangzhou plant dragged down gross margins to less than 5%, prompting the company to introduce a new management team there, industry sources said.</p>
      <p>Tseng stressed that the yield rate for NFC and WPC modules has improved to over 90% in the second half of 2019.</p>
      <p>The sources said the yield rate improvements have allowed Uniflex to make profits from shipments of the modules for Google Pixel 4 smartphones despite the volume lower than shipments to Samsung.</p>
      <p>The sources added Uniflex will kick off shipments of such modules for Samsung's Galaxy S11 series in December and may have a chance of extending them to the Note series and other midrange handsets of the Korean vendor.</p>
      <p>Tseng said Uniflex will ship new flexible boards to Chinese handset vendors in the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>The company also expects to start shipments of mini LED substrates, now mainly manufactured in Taiwan, to more prospective clients in China in 2020, seeking to turn its Taiwan plant operation into profitability next year.</p>
