      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/maxwell-jacob-friedman-mjf">MJF</a> may be in the finals of The Diamond Dozen when he takes on Hangman Page next week on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/all-elite-wrestling">AEW</a> Dynamite, he did receive an assist from his new associate, Wardlow. In an interview with Bleacher Report Live, MJF revealed who Wardlow was and said that he's a freak of nature.</p>
      <p>Wardlow made his AEW Dynamite debut last week when he almost choked out <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cody-rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a>, at the behest of MJF. It was quite plausible to say that Wardlow will serve as an enforcer for MJF going forward.</p>

      <p>In his interview with B/R Live, MJF said that Wardlow is a blue chipper and a genetic freak. He refers to him as Mr. Mayhem. He further said,</p>
      <blockquote>"The man deadlifts 800 pounds, he benches 750, he's a freak of nature. I honestly think he's 300+ pounds, he's a freak.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"But, that's the difference between me and Cody, that people are going to realize real quick. I'm not going to use this man. I care about Wardlow as a human being. Why? Because I'm not a two-faced piece of s**t like Cody Rhodes.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"I want to help Wardlow. I want to be Wardlow's mouthpiece. I want to make sure that Wardlow, along with me, come on the ride, as I ascend to the top of this company."</blockquote>
      <p>He also said that he and Wardlow are going to take over All Elite Wrestling and they're going to do it, real quick.</p>

      <p>It's quite obvious that AEW has plans for both men. Wardlow is being touted as a tough guy who can take on anyone. It'll be interesting how things develop over time.</p>
