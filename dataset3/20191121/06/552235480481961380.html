      <h1>Fraser Forster details the Celtic adrenaline surge that proves Hoops return was right move</h1>
      <h2>Giant goalkeeper has rediscovered a feeling that he'd lost at Southampton.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Wilson, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-wilson/</a></address>
      <p>IT was hailed by some as the greatest save by a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> keeper in the modern era.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/fraser-forster">Fraser Forster</a> doesn’t even rate it as the best he made in the space of five minutes.</p>
      <p>The injury time wonderstop to repel a Danilo Cataldi rocket in last month’s epic <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/europa-league">Europa League</a> victory over <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/lazio">Lazio</a> had onlookers gasping in awe - and the Italian press lamenting the ‘miracle of expired time’.</p>
      <p>But a more routine looking block to deny Marco Parolo moments earlier is what gave the giant keeper the sense of satisfaction that had been sadly missing from his life for the best part of two years.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Put the two saves together - along with the rocking Parkhead atmosphere that greeted the final whistle moments later - and Forster says you get an adrenaline surge so great it almost single handedly erases the 18 months of agony at Southampton that preceded his loan switch back to Parkhead.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old Englishman will be entirely grateful for Celtic, Neil Lennon and goalkeeper coach Stevie Woods for breathing life back into his career at a crucial juncture after an 18-month spell where he made just one competitive appearance since Boxing Day 2017.</p>
      <p>The highly-charged scenes at the final whistle against Lazio, he insists, stand up as the greatest moment of his career.</p>

      <p>Recalling the last gasp save against the Serie A giants, Forster said: “I actually thought the save before that was the better save.</p>
      <p>“For me given the circumstances and the timing in the game, it was pretty much the last kick of the ball, everything around it made a bigger save than it was.</p>
      <p>“When you chat about appreciating playing again and whatever, that moment is probably up there with the best in my career.</p>
      <p>“Off the back of the previous 18 months, it was an actual moment where you are like ‘that’s why you play football.’</p>

      <p>“That moment for me was that. Given the 18 months before, stuff I’d had to deal with, stuff I’d been through, that was probably the first moment when I was like ‘that’s why I’m here, that’s what I’ve missed’.</p>
      <p>“It’s impossible to say how good that feeling is. Just adrenaline, relief, a feeling you are back.</p>
      <p>“You don’t get that feeling in any other aspect of life. Given the previous 18 months, to have that feeling back was something very special.</p>
      <p>“Probably, if I could pick one feeling out of my whole career, that would be the moment I appreciate the most.</p>
      <p>“I always knew I could play at this level. But just as a one off feeling, having to played and to come back and be playing, you know 100 per cent you’ve done the right thing.</p>
      <p>“Those European nights are something special.</p>

      <p>“The atmosphere and everything to do with it – scoring so late in the game to go 2-1 up, then to make the save, it was just something very special.</p>
      <p>“How many times have I watched it back? Not actually that many to be honest.</p>
      <p>“Obviously people sent me it on Instagram. But since then I’ve just moved onto the next thing.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t aware of all the fuss.</p>
      <p>“I just try and stay in my bubble and do my own thing.”</p>

      <p>The goalkeeper admits losing grip of his first team spot and then falling right out the picture at Southampton was the hardest spell of his career.</p>
      <p>There’s clearly anger there but Forster prefers to focus on the positives and driving Celtic towards glory at home and abroad.</p>
      <p>“I thought last season I was training well and doing everything I could to be pushing to get into the right place. But I never really got that opportunity to get back into the team,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Being back here I have that chance to play games and that is what you need. I never lost that belief in myself that I was a good keeper but you need to be able to go out and show people that you are still a good keeper.</p>
      <p>“You only get that chance by going out and playing games. That is what has been brilliant here. They believe in me and they have given me that opportunity.”</p>
      <p>Forster admits he has missed the edge of the Old Firm rivalry and the pressure to win every game - especially as he targets his first ever treble.</p>

      <p>“It is one of the big things up here; the demand on you,” he said. “The pressure on you to win. You do miss that when you go down south because it is a different team and a different league and the goals are different.</p>
      <p>“It would be a great thing to be involved in (winning a treble). You look at what the lads have achieved in the last few years and it has been fantastic.</p>
      <p>“Very few players actually get to compete and go out to win stuff so to come up here and do that it would be something special. That is the dream.”</p>

      <p>Forster has slipped back into the groove at Celtic as if he had never been away. And for that he thanks Woods as well as Lennon.</p>
      <p>The goalkeeper coach developed a young Forster into an England international in his first spell at Parkhead and the keeper hasn’t given up on reclaiming his Three Lions place three years after he last appearance.</p>
      <p>He said: “The manager has been brilliant with me and I am working with a great goalkeeping coach in Stevie Woods.</p>
      <p>“Stevie understands players. His sessions are great but I think he understands the mental side of the game too.</p>
      <p>“He knows what makes each player tick. He’s worked with some incredible keepers during his time here.</p>
      <p>“He has a fantastic record. He just knows how to get the best out of the players he’s working with and he’s definitely up there with the best I have worked with.</p>
      <p>“He took me from a League One keeper and turned me into an England international.</p>
      <p>“I would love to get back in there (with England). But it’s out of my hands. I just need to play as well as I can and force someone else into making a decision.”</p>
      <p>Fraser Forster was speaking as he helped promote the launch of the 2020 Celtic FC Festival which begins on Friday, July 24 and runs for three days.</p>
