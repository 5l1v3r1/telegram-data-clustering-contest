      <p>Catastrophic fire conditions on Wednesday prompted SA Power Networks to cut power to Port Lincoln and other towns on lower Eyre Peninsula. But not to lower Yorke Peninsula.</p>
      <p>But the electricity remained connected on Yorke Peninsula – <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/a1f5e89b087c3978b7f7e1fddbd96a2a">where fires have destroyed homes and scorched thousands of hectares</a> – because it is classified as a medium-risk area.</p>
      <p>The Yorketown fire was <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/a1f5e89b087c3978b7f7e1fddbd96a2a">caused by an electrical fault</a>, reportedly at the town’s water tank.</p>
      <p>The decision to cut power sparked complaints on social media and talkback radio from frustrated Eyre Peninsula residents.</p>
      <p>SA Power Networks spokesman Paul Roberts told <i>The Advertiser</i> the distributor needed to consider several elements before deciding to disconnect electricity.</p>
      <p>“We are monitoring wind speeds, fire danger index and wind gusts,” Mr Roberts said.</p>
      <p>“We base our criteria on research we have done through the CSIRO on wind speeds and their impact on electricity infrastructure.</p>
      <p>“(The CSIRO) are pretty clear on the 63km/h (wind speed) mark is when you really start to see issues emerging on a day like (Wednesday).”</p>

      <p>Mr Roberts said any decision to disconnect power was made by the distributor after consultation with the Country Fire Service and authorities.</p>
      <p>He said high bushfire-risk areas – lower Eyre Peninsula, Mid North and Mt Lofty Ranges – were more likely to have power cut on days of catastrophic fire danger.</p>
      <p>“You have to confirm the conditions. We don’t turn it off at the first puff of wind,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We need to see a pattern, we need to have some reports of other issues that might support the need to turn off (the power).</p>
      <p>“Lower Eyre Peninsula is a high fire-risk area where as Yorke Peninsula is a medium bushfire-risk area.</p>
      <p>“Port Lincoln has had some <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/24e4b299d1fd63fde838939e9c175b24">very serious fires</a>, which pushes it up into our categorisation of it as a high bushfire-risk area.</p>
      <p>“Our assessment of high and medium bushfire risk is based on detailed research we’ve conducted with the CSIRO and insurers based on experience.”</p>

      <p>Mr Roberts said SA Power Networks was monitoring weather conditions for the next day up to seven days every day throughout the year.</p>
      <p>He said planning for Wednesday’s catastrophic conditions started on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Our emergency management team met on Monday. We have a team who meet to plan our response and what we will do in terms of resources,” Mr Roberts said.</p>
      <p>“That team met again on Tuesday and we decided, for example, to cancel most of the planned work around the state that would have involved outages.</p>
      <p>“We made the decision about standing down field resources so that they would be available later in the day as the day developed.</p>
      <p>“We also established that we would have a disconnection order group in place on Wednesday and that group monitors the weather across the state with a specific focus on the high and medium bushfire-risk areas.</p>
      <p>“That team is trained, experienced and has a detailed set of criteria on which to assess the need for disconnection.”</p>
      <p>Mr Roberts said community safety – protecting lives and property – was SA Power Networks’ priority.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very finely balanced decision based on numerous factors. It’s not an easy decision and we’re very conscious that turning off power means people will not have electricity,” he said.</p>
