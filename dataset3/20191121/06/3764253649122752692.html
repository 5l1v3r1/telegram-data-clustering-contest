      <p>After its recent successful outing in Kogi and Bayelsa, the All Progressives Congress (APC) is believed to have been gripped with the fear of losing Edo state to the opposition over the lingering feud between its national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki.</p>
      <p>As part of moves to forestall this, the APC has appointed the governor of Kano, Abdullahi Ganduje, to resolve the crisis in Edo and rescue the party from being drowned.</p>
      <p>Ganduje is to head a five-man committee set up by the party's National Working Committee (NWC).</p>

      </p>
      <p>A statement by Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, national spokesperson of the party, said a part of the committee's task is to meet and speak with all sides to the crisis and report to the headquarters.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Other members of the committee are: governor of Katsina state, Aminu Bello Masari; former governor of Oyo, Abiola Ajimobi; former governor of Borno and serving senator, Kashim Shettima and Honourable Ahmed Wadada (secretary).</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“This marks another step in our party’s effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis and ensure our party comes out of it even stronger,"</i> the APC said.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported how Oshiomhole recently <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277233-oshiomhole-apc-chairman-narrates-betrayed-by-son.html">proved he is not a happy man</a> as he accused the deputy governor of Edo, Philip Shaibu, of betraying him after he helped the latter to <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1256503-power-season-6-cast-episodes-where-to-watch.html">power</a>.</p>
      <p>Oshiomhole, who called Shaibu his 'son', lamented that the deputy governor tried to humiliate him by bringing thugs to the home of the national chairman of the APC in Iyamho, Edo state, recently.</p>
