        <b>HONG KONG : Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group raised up to US$12.9 billion (S$17.6 billion) in a landmark listing in Hong Kong.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is the largest share sale in the city in nine years and a world record for a cross-border secondary share sale.</p>
      <p>The deal will be seen as a boost to Hong Kong, following more than five months of anti-government protests and its recent slide into its first recession in a decade.</p>
      <p>Alibaba confirmed it had priced the shares at HK$176 (S$30.63) each, a discount of 2.9 per cent to its New York closing price. This means Alibaba will raise at least HK$88 billion - a symbolic total as the number 8 is associated with prosperity and good fortune in Chinese culture.</p>
      <p>Alibaba has also chosen the stock code 9988 for its listing, which for Chinese speakers combines two of the luckiest numbers, together symbolising long-lasting prosperity.</p>
      <p>The total raised from the deal could eventually reach US$12.9 billion if a so-called "greenshoe" over-allotment option were exercised.</p>
      <p>Alibaba shares closed in New York on Tuesday at US$185.25. One of Alibaba's New York-listed American Depositary Shares is worth eight of its Hong Kong shares. - REUTERS</p>
