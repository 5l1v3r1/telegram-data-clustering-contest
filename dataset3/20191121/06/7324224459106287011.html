      <p>Nick Slym shared content deemed "extreme in nature" which brought West Midlands Police into disrepute, a misconduct hearing heard.</p>
      <p>Slym, who was based at Brierley Hill and worked as a response officer in Dudley, resigned on November 6 and admitted his actions.</p>
      <p>But chief constable Dave Thompson told the hearing: "The former officer would have been dismissed without notice, otherwise."</p>
      <p>The hearing was told Slym also "solicited" information from a Lincolnshire-based custody officer, which was not police-related.</p>
      <p>"Clearly this was an abuse of his position," said Mr Thompson.</p>
      <h3>WhatsApp groups</h3>
      <p>A mobile phone was seized from a prison officer on February 12, which showed Slym was part of two WhatsApp groups, one of which had 21 members.</p>
      <p>It was on at least one of these groups that Slym shared racist, homophobic and derogatory content.</p>
      <p>The hearing heard Slym was part of at least one group on the encrypted messaging service for a prolonged period of time.</p>
      <p>"It was clear that the witnesses failed to challenge the content of the material or remove him from the group," said Mr Thompson.</p>
      <p>"The officer admitted that the conduct took place at times when he was on and off duty."</p>
      <p>He added that the content shared was of an "extreme nature".</p>
      <p>The hearing did not provide any further details of what content was shared.</p>
      <p>Chief superintendent Chris Todd, head of professional standards, told the hearing: "The actions are a clear breach of conduct.</p>
      <p>"This demonstrates he couldn't be trusted to perform his role as an officer.</p>
      <p>"He has admitted to receiving and sending content. His actions were intended and deliberate.</p>
      <p>"His actions involved accessing confidential information without a police purpose.</p>
      <p>"Were the actions known to the public, they would have caused upset to communities."</p>
      <p>The hearing concluded that Slym committed gross misconduct in his job.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police accepted his resignation after he handed it in this month.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of Slym, who was not present for the hearing, Dave Hadley from the Police Federation said: "He would like to apologise to you all for the behaviour that has caused reputational damage to the organisation."</p>
