      <p>Billings for semiconductor manufacturing equipment reached a 14-month high of  $2.11 billion in October 2019, according to SEMI.</p>
      <p>The billings figure is 7.7% higher than September’s $1.96 billion and 3.9% above October 2018 billings of  $2.03 billion, SEMI said.</p>
      <p>“Monthly billings of North American equipment manufacturers registered their first year-over-year increase since October 2018,” said Ajit Manocha, president and CEO of SEMI,  “equipment billings are accelerating on the strength of memory inventory drawdowns and foundry investments in leading-edge equipment.”</p>
