        <b>TOKYO, Japan, Nov 21 – Tokyo 2020 organisers on Thursday unveiled the Sh 52.9bn ($523 million) venue for swimming, diving and artistic swimming that will seat 15,000 fans for the Olympic and Paralympic Games next year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Construction is 90 percent complete at the four-storey Aquatics Centre and is due to be finished on schedule by the end of February, officials said.</p>
      <p>“We are aiming to construct a swimming venue to the world’s highest standards equipped with the latest facilities,” Tokyo 2020 venue official Daishuu Tone told reporters.</p>
      <p>The main pool features a movable wall allowing the 50m facility to be converted into two 25m pools. The depth of the bottom can also be adjusted.</p>
      <p>The building cost 56.7 billion yen but Tokyo hopes to make the most of the facility after the 2020 Games, aiming to attract one million users a year — 850,000 through swimming competitions and another 150,000 casual users.</p>
      <p>Organisers also unveiled the Ariake Arena on Thursday, a 37-billion-yen site for Olympic volleyball and wheelchair basketball.</p>
      <p>Construction on the main venue, the 159 billion yen National Stadium, has been completed and will be unveiled in a gala opening on December 21.</p>
      <p>Musicians and star athletes will join the event, with world-record sprinter Usain Bolt featuring in an exhibition relay.</p>
