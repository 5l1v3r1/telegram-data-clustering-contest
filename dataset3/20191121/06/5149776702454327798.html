      <h1>Takeaway addict who battled postnatal depression fights her way back to lose half her weight</h1>
      <h2>The mum-of-three has dropped 10 stone</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T06:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>A mum who struggled with her weight due to depression has fought back in a dramatic transformation.</p>
      <p>Kelly Redfern, who once weighed 20 stone, has trimmed down to just 10 stone over three years.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old has spoken of how she would previously eat once a day by gorging on pizzas and kebabs.</p>
      <p>But the mum-of-three has turned her life around by cutting out the takeaways and swimming 60 lengths a day, equal to nearly a mile.</p>
      <p>She also stepped into the ring for a <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/charities">charity</a> boxing event with training help from her dad, a former welterweight <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/boxing">boxer</a>.</p>
      <p>Kelly of Blidworth, said the problems started aged 14 when she began suffering with depression.</p>
      <p>This escalated in 2004 following the births of her twin daughters Germaine and Courtney, who arrived prematurely.</p>
      <p>"When I had the twins, I would cry all the time and just never want to go out of the house," she said.</p>
      <p>"Typically, I would only eat one large meal a day, and that would include takeaways such as pizza or kebabs when I didn’t want to cook.</p>
      <p>"I would not eat again until the next evening at around 9pm or 10pm and I never ate breakfast."</p>

        <figcaption>Kelly said she had struggled with depression since she was 14 which had an effect on her weight.</figcaption>

      <p>Doctors told Kelly she was suffering with postnatal depression.</p>
      <p>She added: "My girls were born prematurely, they only weighed a pound and half, and two pounds. There were a lot of complications that I struggled to handle.</p>
      <p>"The more depressed I was, the more I would stay in and eat."</p>
      <p>Kelly took on a strict regime to try and cut her weight down, including having a healthy breakfast, balanced meals and swimming.</p>
      <p>However, after managing to lose seven stone, Kelly hit a wall and signed up to a gruelling boxing programme with Ultra White Collar Boxing.</p>
      <p>Ultra White Collar Boxing (UWCB) participants are given the opportunity to raise money for Cancer Research UK.</p>
      <p>There are eight weeks of free professional training before a showcase fight in front of hundreds of spectators.</p>
      <p>"I wanted to do something for charity that was a bit different and wasn't running a marathon," she said.</p>
      <p>"The events were for a really good cause and after losing my gran, Connie, to stomach cancer a couple of years ago it seemed like the right thing to do."</p>

      <p>To help her train, Kelly's dad David Mitchell, a former welterweight boxer in the 1950s turned landscape gardener, stepped in.</p>
      <p>Kelly said: "He trained me the same way he was trained way back in the 1950s. We trained most evenings for an hour at a time when he came home from work, doing lots of pad work and punch bag exercises.</p>
      <p>"Training with him was nice. We haven't really had that bond before and this brought us closer.</p>
      <p>"When I won my fight, my dad was in tears, he said it was the proudest moment of his life, apart from when I was born obviously.</p>
      <p>"The Ultra event was amazing and it really helped me. You make loads of friends that you are training with and sparring with and it encouraged me to carry on with my fitness when I was finding it hard to lose weight."</p>

      <p>Kelly has continued to lose weight since her win at the John Fretwell centre and goes to the gym regularly saying sher trainer at The Fitness Box, Mansfield checks in with her if she ever misses a class.</p>
      <p>So far, Ultra Events - the company behind the boxing event - has raised a staggering £20 million for Cancer Research UK.</p>
      <p>Those taking part are asked to sell tickets for the show and raise at least £50 for the charity.</p>
      <p>The next Ultra White Collar Boxing event takes place in Mansfield on March 29 and training starts in the week commencing February 3.</p>
