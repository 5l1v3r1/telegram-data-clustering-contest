      <p>Best known as a specialist distributor, Charcroft is now  extending its  in-house value-add engineering capabilities.</p>
      <p> In addition to the existing manufacturing capabilities, Charcroft has created a new department of engineers to address bespoke manufacturing projects including:</p>
      <p>• Light manual assembly (nut and bolt) • Hand soldering to J-STD-001</p>
      <p>• Epoxy resin encapsulation</p>
      <p>• Electrical harness manufacture</p>
      <p>• Wire cutting and stripping • Crimping and light riveting • Heat shrink fitting</p>
      <p>• Taping and reeling</p>
      <p>• Component screening/binning, burn-in</p>
      <p>• Third-harmonic, component linearity testing • Component sub-assembly</p>
      <p>• Heatsink attachments</p>
      <p>• Busbars</p>
      <p>• Box building and system-builds</p>
      <p>Previously offering custom passive assemblies, flying leads options, printing and labelling, this capability has now been extended to include specialist technical solutions, design support, low production volumes and prototype builds.</p>
      <p>The investment in a new facility added to design-support from their team of engineers and technical specialists, allows  Charcroft to offer life extension to parts by aiding with managing process obsolescence. </p>
