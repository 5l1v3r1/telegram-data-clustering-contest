      <p>Tax deadlines and <a href="https://www.inc.com/carrie-mckeegan/everything-you-need-to-know-about-employee-tax-forms.html?cid=search">tax forms</a> may not be the most glamorous part of being a CEO, but they are an essential part. And <a href="https://www.inc.com/carrie-mckeegan/tax-reform-what-you-need-to-know-about-a-common-business-deduction.html?cid=search">American taxes are changing</a> all the time. So, to get you geared up for 2020, let's take a look at some of the most critical tax deadlines for corporations next year.</p>
      <p>Because, let's face it, scrambling to get ready at the last minute isn't a sign of things going well. Being <a href="https://www.inc.com/gene-marks/the-6-best-2019-tax-moves-for-your-business.html?cid=search">prepared for your tax-filing obligations</a> starts with having all the significant dates accessible in one place and knowing what to do beforehand. Grab your calendar, and let's get started.</p>
      <h3>January 31, 2020</h3>
      <p>This date is important because it's the deadline for sending out your W-2s to the applicable workers: just the employees and not the independent contractors. The IRS uses three factors to differentiate between the two: behavioral control, financial control, and relationship. The more power your company has and the more benefits that you offer, the more likely you are to have an employee rather than a contractor. Making a mistake when classifying the employee can leave you open to employment taxes, so make sure you've given it some thought.</p>
      <h3>February 28, 2020</h3>
      <p>Form 1099 reports are due, via the filing of Form 1096. This is how you let the IRS know the total number of 1099s you issued. If you e-filed your 1099 forms, you might be able to skip this step.</p>
      <h3>March 16, 2020</h3>
      <p>For partnerships and S Corporations, March 16 is the deadline for tax returns. S Corporations should plan to file Form 1102-S, and partnerships will use Form 1065. If necessary, you can apply for a six-month extension, but the extension is for the filing, not the payment, of taxes. Interest will apply to any overdue taxes.</p>
      <h3>April 1, 2020</h3>
      <p>For those who e-file the 1099s, this is the deadline to have them submitted.</p>
      <h3>April 15, 2020</h3>
      <p>April 15 is not just the deadline for individuals and first quarter estimated taxes; it is also the deadline for corporations who will use Form 1120. Certain corporations are also eligible to receive a six-month tax extension from this deadline.</p>
      <h3>June 15, 2020</h3>
      <p>Second quarter estimated taxes are due for businesses that are required to file them.</p>
      <h3>September 15, 2020</h3>
      <p>Third quarter estimated taxes are due on this date, as are tax returns for anyone who received the six-month extension from March 16.</p>
      <h3>October 15, 2020</h3>
      <p>Any corporations that received a six-month extension from April 15 will have their tax returns come due on this date.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that other forms may apply. For instance, most corporations and anyone who is the sole proprietor of a business will need to file a Schedule C in addition to Form 1120.</p>
      <p>Staying ahead of your tax deadlines can save you time, money, and certainly a lot of stress. Now that you have a simple outline for the most important corporate tax deadlines and forms for the year, you are ready to celebrate the upcoming year by staying far from the IRS' audit radar.</p>
