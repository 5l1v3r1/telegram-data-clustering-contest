      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/halle-berry">Halle Berry</a> isn't letting her recent on-set injury hold her back.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/halle-berry-injured-on-set-mma-film-bruised-report">The actress was hurt while filming a fight scene</a> for her new MMA-inspired flick "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">Bruised</a>."</p>
      <p>Despite the injury, however, Berry, 53, is "just getting started."</p>

      <p>The "Monster's Ball" star took to Instagram to update fans on her condition.</p>
      <p>"Thank you to all the folks that have showered me with love since my injury," Berry captioned the photo, possibly a still from the movie. "It’s par for the course when you do your own stunts, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. Just know I’m far from tired. I’m wide awake...and just getting started! 💪🏽🙏🏽 #BruisedTheMovie."</p>
      <p>After the injury delayed production on Monday, a rep for the flick said, "Halle got slightly injured in the fight. She’s tired. She needed a break.”</p>

      <p>Production is expected to resume on Friday.</p>
      <p>"Bruised," which also serves as Berry's feature directorial debut, follows Berry as a disgraced MMA fighter forced to confront her demons when the six-year-old son she walked out on returns to her doorstep.</p>
      <p>When Berry began training for the film, she posted a photo to Instagram, displaying her pride in finally having "ripped abs."</p>
