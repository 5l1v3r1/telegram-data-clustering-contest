      <p>A 40-year-old man accused of trafficking and possessing a variety of illegal drugs has been refused bail.</p>
      <p>Police raided a Lonsdale Street unit in Redan on November 19 where they allegedly located a large quantity of ecstasy in zip lock bags, deal bags containing methamphetamine, GHB, cash and a notebook containing people's names.</p>
      <p>Police nominal informant Senior Constable Michelle Cosgrave told the Ballarat Magistrates Court on Wednesday other drugs located at the unit included cannabis buds, seeds and seedlings, while more than $20,000 worth of stolen tools, guitars and stereo systems was found.</p>

      <p>She said Paul Milenkovic and other associates, who did not live at the address, were in the house.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Cosgrave said $5000 cash, in $1000 bundles, was located in his pocket.</p>
      <p>He was arrested but was not interviewed because he was "extremely" drug affected.</p>
      <p>In arguing for bail, Milenkovic's lawyer said his client was temporarily living at the Redan rental unit and the case would be delayed due to forensic testing.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Michelle Mykytowycz refused Milenkovic's bail application because he had not shown compelling reasons.</p>
