      <p>Facebook Dating users can now share Instagram Stories and Facebook Stories to their dating profiles. The update gives singles yet another reason to post fresh content to Facebook properties. Stories cannot be posted directly to dating profiles—instead they must be shared from across other Facebook services.“We’re leveraging Stories that people are already producing,” said lead product manager on Stories, Charmaine Hung, in an interview with <i>Forbes</i>. “We’re not trying to create a whole new production cycle for people.”</p>
      <p>Facebook Dating users will be required to opt in by linking their Facebook and Instagram accounts to their dating profile in order to begin using the new feature. Once the accounts are linked, users can add any of the Stories they’ve posted in the last 24 hours.</p>

      <p>Facebook Dating—which threatens the dominant dating apps run by Match Group including Tinder and OKCupid—is still largely in its infancy. The company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/04/f8-2019-day-1/">announced</a> the service at its annual developer conference in April. “This is going to be for building real, long-term relationships,” said CEO Mark Zuckerberg during the announcement. “Not just hookups.” It began rolling out in the U.S. starting in September.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg has warned investors that the social network will begin rapidly moving away from the company’s most popular product in history: the News Feed, the stream of content on the app’s home screen that has long been considered the core of its platform. Instead, Facebook and Instagram are now focusing on Stories, the ephemeral photos and video posts made popular by its rival Snapchat. People are sharing more than one billion “Stories” on Facebook every day, according to the company.</p>
      <p>“All of the trends that we’ve seen suggest that in the not-too-distant future, people will be sharing more into Stories than they will into Feeds,” Zuckerberg <a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2018/Q3/Q318-earnings-call-transcript.pdf">said</a> in a call with investors last year.</p>
      <p>Now that strategy is being employed inside one of the company’s newest and most promising products, Facebook Dating.</p>
      <p>Marketing professionals are already seeing the impact of Facebook’s strategy. “Stories are becoming a primary format,” says CMO of data science and marketing technology company 4C Insights Aaron Goldman. “[We’ve seen] Facebook Stories Ads spending growing 554% year-over-year in Q3 and Instagram Stories Ads spending up 139%.”</p>
      <p>In March, Zuckerberg published a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/a-privacy-focused-vision-for-social-networking/10156700570096634/">3,200-word manifesto</a> about the company’s transition from an open network to one that instead focuses on privacy. One of the key principles in his manifesto was “reducing permanence.”</p>
      <p>“People should be comfortable being themselves,” he wrote, “and should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later.”</p>
