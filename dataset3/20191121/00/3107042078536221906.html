      <p>The storm on Wednesday afternoon damaged the Selwyn Aquatic Centre ceiling, causing the facility to close.</p>
      <p>The centre is currently being repaired after it was battered by hail and lightning.</p>
      <p>ItÂ is likely to re-open on Friday, said an aquatic centre spokeswoman.</p>
      <p>"We don't have an indication of when exactly we will be open again yet but it's looking like it will be (on Friday)."</p>
      <p>She said the storm caused a power surge, which shut down the centre's heating and air handling systems.</p>
      <p>When the systems restarted it caused a vibration through the air ducting, which resulted in some of the supporting bolts being pulled from the ceiling in the main pool area.</p>
      <p>"There are maintenance workers here at the moment replacing the bolts," the spokeswoman said on Thursday.</p>
