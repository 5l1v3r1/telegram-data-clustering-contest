        <b>RCD Mallorca midfielder Iddrisu Babá will undergo further assessment on the extent of injury suffered while on international duty with Ghana.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old picked up a thigh injury during his country's 1-0 win over Sao Tome and Principe in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Monday.</p>
      <p>The setback followed an ankle sprain he picked up during his debut match for the Black Stars in their 2-0 win over South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Ghana international will undergo further test on the extent of injury after arriving in Spain.</p>
      <p>Baba impressed in his first two outings for the African giants as they maintain a perfect start for the qualifying campaign for Cameroon 2021.</p>
      <p>He will unlikely to be involved when Mallorca travel to Levante in the La Liga on Friday.</p>
