      <p>The five tracks that make the most noise on the new singles ranking across the pond represent a healthy mix of what everybody in the U.K. is listening to right now: plenty of hip-hop, some tunes from singer-songwriters, the occasional K-pop smash and, because it’s that time of the year, Christmas jams. Here’s a look at five of the most important moves on this week’s U.K. singles chart.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 13 - Fredo - “Netflix &amp; Chill”</b>
      </p>
      <p>U.K.-based hip-hop musician Fredo narrowly misses scoring his third top 10 hit with his new solo song “Netflix &amp; Chill,” which is about...well...we all know. The rapper’s cut starts at No. 13, making it the musician’s seventh top 40 hit in the country and the second-loftiest debut this time around (behind J Hus’ “Must Be”).</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 24 - Arizona Zervas - “Roxanne”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nobody’s star is rising faster than Arizona Zervas’ is at the moment, and in no time, he’s already landed his first actual hit single in the U.K. Last week, the viral smash “Roxanne” entered the race just outside the top 40, and after one more full week of availability, the track jumps into the important region, settling at No. 24.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 40 - Tom Walker - “Better Half of Me”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, singer-songwriter Tom Walker debuted his first album <i>What a Time to Be Alive</i> at No. 1, quickly proving himself to be a major player in the field. Now, he’s rereleased the set with some new tracks, and one of them has become another hit for the musician. “Better Half of Me” rises to No. 40 this time around, granting Walker his third top 40 success.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 77 - Mariah Carey - “All I Want for Christmas Is You”</b>
      </p>
      <p>It wouldn’t be the holidays without Mariah Carey, and it seems the the time to celebrate has officially kicked off. The legendary singer’s festive favorite “All I Want for Christmas Is You” returns to the U.K.’s songs ranking, placing at No. 77 this week. As the big day approaches, the inescapable track is sure to climb even higher.</p>
      <p>“All I Want for Christmas Is You” has now ranked somewhere between Nos. 1 and 100 for 93 nonconsecutive weeks.</p>
      <p>
        <b>No. 90 - BTS - “Make It Right”</b>
      </p>
      <p>After falling to No. 98 last week, it looked like BTS’s “Make It Right” was about to fall off the singles chart in the U.K., but that did not turn out to be the case. In fact, fans of the group purchased and streamed the former album cut in larger numbers than before, and it ascends to No. 90 this time around. The song has now lived on the chart for five frames, making it the septet’s second-longest-charting piece of music. “Make It Right” has now spent half as much time on the songs chart in the U.K. as the band’s longest-running hit, “Boy with Luv.”</p>
