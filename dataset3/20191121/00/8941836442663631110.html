      <p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - A fifth Illinois resident has died after being hospitalized with a vaping-related lung injury.</p>
      <p>The Illinois Department of Public Health on Thursday did not release any information about the victim, nor when or where the death occurred.</p>
      <p>According to the department, 187 people in Illinois, ranging from 13 years to 75 years old have experienced lung injuries after e-cigarette use.</p>
      <p>Public Health director Dr. Ngozi Ezike says it is important that people not use e-cigarettes or vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The highest risk for lung injury associated with the use of e-cigarettes appears to be among those who use THC containing products.</p>
