      <p>Education innovations and breakthroughs that are actually working to improve teaching and learning are overlooked by the donors and investors who could help those innovations spread or take root. Earlier this year, for example, I wrote about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereknewton/2019/04/02/the-top-education-innovations-arent-funded-by-investors/#1f07bcb33326">a report</a> by <a href="https://hundred.org/fi">HundrED</a>, the Finland non-profit that searches the world for the best and most promising innovations in education. That report found that for the best innovations of 2019, a scant 7% were funded by capital investments and just 5% were funded by governments. The majority of breakout innovations (51%) were funded by donations and grants and nearly a quarter (23%) were self-financed by the teachers or communities that started them.</p>
      <p>With billions of dollars sloshing around in venture capital funds and in non-profit foundation coffers, the disconnect between the money and the good ideas underscores two points.</p>
      <p>The first is that, for all the talking education and edtech investors do about their missions to improve education, they routinely miss the opportunity to put their funding where their press releases are. But the second and more important point is how the funding disconnect is hurting genuine education advancements, ideas and programs and tactics that are actually working already. Good ideas, great discoveries in education were and are withering because there is no funding to sustain them, let alone scale them.</p>
      <p>That’s bad news. A piece of good news is that HundrED, whose mission it is find and spread those innovations, has taken some promising, proactive steps to connect the dollars or euros or yen to the innovations and innovators they find.</p>
      <p>At their annual conference in Helsinki this month, HundrED leaders launched <a href="https://connect.hundred.org/">HundrED Connect</a>, an invited community in which funding leaders can find, review and hopefully invest in the best education ideas around the world. With it, they also put forward a <a href="https://hundred.org/fi/funders">collection of funders</a> doing the important work of supporting actual education innovations.</p>
      <p>“It’s remarkable that the third biggest investment source for education innovations is self-funding. The innovators highlighted in our HundrED 2020 collection are so passionate about the future of education that they are willing to pay for their own efforts,” said Lasse Leponiemi, Executive Director and Co-Founder of HundrED. “We hope the first-ever Education Funders Collection will encourage more venture capital, grant-giving and donations to provide opportunities for these inspiring global innovations to scale up and positively impact even more students and teachers around the world.”</p>
      <p>It’s an important advancement for HundrED and other leaders in the global education community. The new programs represent a realization that in order to scale and prosper, the best ideas in teaching and learning need more than just attention, they need funding. It’s clear that donors and investors aren’t going to go find the good ideas themselves, someone needs to pull them to the table and show them what’s working and how they can help. And, at the same time, the innovators need to know who they can ask for help, and how.</p>
      <p>It’s a new initiative so it’s too soon to know how impactful it will be. But judging by the heavy-weight funders, investors and donors walking around the HundrED conference, the prospects are promising.</p>
      <p>Gregg Behr, Executive Director of the <a href="https://grable.org/">Grable Foundation</a>, the $300 million non-profit based in Pittsburg made the trek to the conference in Helsinki. Sarah Bouchie, Head of Global Programmes, at education heavyweight, <a href="https://www.legofoundation.com/en/">Lego Foundation</a> spoke and met with global innovators. Lesley Mansford, Global Head of CSR for <a href="http://supercell.com/en/">Supercell</a> – they make immensely popular games such as Boom Beach and Clash of Clans – was there too. All three are sponsors of HundrED.</p>
      <p>Based on that guest list, you may think that funding scalable education innovations is the work of non-profits and wealth benefactors. But there’s money to be made in education innovation and a few education investor types were sniffing around the conference too. HundrED says just over a third of its highlighted funders are venture investors.</p>
      <p>For investors, that’s a smart play. Education innovators with proven impact and massive adoption in places such as Kenya, Kosovo and Kyrgyz Republic – each of which had at least one recognized education innovation on this year’s list – aren’t too likely to put together a power point and jet to The Valley for a pitch meet. Most likely, they are teachers or school administrators or community leaders first and entrepreneurs second.</p>
      <p>While HundrED proves that great ideas can come from anywhere, the funding comes from reliably predictable places. It’s good that someone is making that connection.</p>
