      <p>Known for shiny production and delightfully crunchy sounds, Hannah Diamond has been a key member of the PC Music crew for years. "Love Goes On," a single from her forthcoming debut album, is Diamond at her most pensive, singing at the tail-end of a bad breakup and pondering how life can continue. <br/><br/>Much of the conversation around PC Music focuses on its singular production style, but not enough credit is given to candid vocalists, like Diamond, whose stark British accent often makes them sound a lot younger. On "Love Goes On," it plays to her advantage, layering vulnerability over pop-perfect production. The chorus pays homage to Celine Dion's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVLzWqITfMs">immortal offering</a> to the love-song canon, but Diamond makes it her own: raw, true and sincere.</p>
