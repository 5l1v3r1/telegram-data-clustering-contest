      <p>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) - State media in Vietnam say a journalist has been arrested for “anti-state” activities.</p>
      <p>The official Vietnam News Agency said Pham Chi Dung was arrested Thursday on accusations of “producing, possessing and spreading anti-state information and documents.”</p>
      <p>Dung, 53, is a former army officer and Communist Party member. The VNA said he had frequently conducted serious and unlawful activities that hurt social security and stability.</p>
      <p>Voice of America Vietnamese published an article by Dung last week in which he criticized the European Union for signing a free trade agreement with Vietnam despite its poor human rights improvement and urged the bloc to consider before ratifying it.</p>

        <p>Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson said Dung’s arrest showed Vietnam’s “repressive intolerance of any dissenting voices.”</p>
