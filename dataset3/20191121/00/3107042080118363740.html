      <p>Canterbury University's first female professor of political science has received another prestigious honour.</p>
      <p>Anne-Marie Brady has been named a Fellow of the Royal Society Te Apārangi. She is the first female political scientist and only the fourth political scientist to do so.</p>
      <p>She was recognised for her research and advancement of science and technology.</p>
      <p>Prof Brady has worked on China’s foreign and domestic politics, Antarctic and Arctic politics, Pacific politics and New Zealand foreign policy.</p>
      <p>"I am truly honoured to be joining the ranks of the Fellows of the Royal Society of New Zealand, especially because I am the first female political scientist to be accepted as a fellow,” she said.</p>
      <p>“It amazes me that after more than 100 years of the feminist movement in Aotearoa New Zealand there are still glass ceilings to be broken.</p>
      <p>“I hope my achievements can inspire others to take an interest in politics and in the well-being of our society.</p>
      <p>"A strong democracy relies on an active, engaged, and inclusive citizenry.”</p>
      <p>Prof Brady also won the 2019 women of influence - global category award.</p>
