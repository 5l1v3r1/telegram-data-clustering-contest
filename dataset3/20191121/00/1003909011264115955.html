      <h1>Humboldt Broncos crash survivor Straschnitzki takes steps after surgery, online video shows</h1>

      <p>A video posted to Twitter on Wednesday shows Ryan Straschnitzki taking steps for the first time since the Humboldt Broncos bus crash.</p>
      <p>Straschnitzki travelled to Thailand to receive a spinal surgery that he hoped would restore some of his movement after being paralyzed from the chest down in the April 2018 collision.</p>
      <p>The video on Twitter shows Straschnitzki walking with the assistance of medical personnel and a walker-like apparatus. The post said therapists were helping with his knees and ankles so they wouldn’t buckle underneath him. His steps were slow and small, but there is movement in his legs that hasn’t been there in more than a year and a half.</p>
      <p>“(First) time since he boarded the bus that horrendous day,” his father Tom said on Twitter.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/quite-optimistic-ryan-straschnitzki-has-spinal-surgery-in-thailand">surgical procedure</a> Straschnitzki underwent in early November involved an epidural stimulator, which is a small implanted device that sends electrical currents to his spinal cord to try to stimulate nerves and move limbs. The implant has been programmed over the past few weeks to stimulate certain nerves mapped out by surgeons and therapists.</p>
      <p>The surgery can cost up to $100,000 and isn’t covered by health care or insurance. It is also performed in countries such as the United States and Switzerland, but it’s much cheaper in Thailand.</p>
