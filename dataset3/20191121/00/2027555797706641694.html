      <h1>Musk to face defamation suit over 'pedo' tweet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:04:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>A federal judge has cleared the way for a defamation trial against Elon Musk over his comments about a British cave rescuer after rejecting key arguments from the Tesla chief.</p>
      <p>US judge Stephen Wilson ordered a trial to begin December 3 in Los Angeles in the case that centers on Musk's tweets in a disagreement connected to the rescue of 12 boys from a cave in Thailand in July 2018.</p>
      <p>Musk called Vernon Unsworth "pedo guy" after Unsworth, who helped with the rescue, ridiculed Musk's proposal to build a mini-submarine during the crisis as a "PR stunt."</p>
      <p>The judge rejected Musk's argument that the term "pedo guy" was a common insult and would be seen as an opinion and not a statement of fact.</p>
      <p>Wilson said some of Musk's subsequent statements suggested he believed the charge about Unsworth to be true, which has "created a genuine dispute over the meaning of Defendant's Tweets" that "must be resolved by a jury."</p>
      <p>Unsworth has denied being a pedophile.</p>
      <p>Wilson accepted aspects of Musk's argument that Unsworth was a "limited public figure" who had voluntarily injected himself into the public debate about how to save the boys.</p>
      <p>To win a defamation case in US courts, public figures like celebrities must show actual malice on the part of the person making a false statement, as opposed to the lower standard of negligence.</p>
      <p>But Wilson ruled Musk should not be shielded him from a defamation lawsuit because the allegation of pedophilia was not connected to the debate about how to save the boys.</p>
      <p>"To allow criticism into every aspect of a plaintiff's life simply because he chose to get involved in a limited issue would render him an all-purpose public figure," Wilson wrote in a decision earlier this week.</p>
      <p>"For defendant's comments to relate to Plaintiff's participation in public controversies, there must be some relationship between pedophilia and the rescue or the subs -- there is simply no credible connection here."</p>
      <p>Alex Spiro, an attorney representing Musk, said in an email that "we look forward to the trial."</p>
