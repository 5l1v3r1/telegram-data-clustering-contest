        <b>Switzerland's Cornèrcard has teamed up with Gemalto and Visa to launch the country's first credit card featuring a biometric fingerprint reader.</b>
      </p>
      <p>To register a fingerprint on the limited edition Cornèrcard biometric gold Visa credit card, users touch a sensor, with an LED signalling the successful capture.<br/><br/>Then, for the first transaction with the card, users enter a PIN. After this, they can confirm payments at the point of sale by touching the sensor on the card with their finger.<br/><br/>Davide Rigamonti, director, Cornèrcard, says: "The biometric payment card is not only special in terms of its appearance; it also guarantees a special payment experience and fits perfectly into the everyday life of the modern consumer."</p>
