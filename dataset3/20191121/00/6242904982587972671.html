      <p>The U-23 team needs to beat South Africa in the third and fourth match play off to grab the final slot for Africa in Tokyo 2020.</p>
      <p>Following the team's defeat to Ivory Coast in the semi finals on Tuesday, the players have all switched their attention to the game on Friday, with Mensah confident of victory.</p>
      <p>"Never give up at all in life, Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games Qualification dream still on course," he posted on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Mensah has been one of the outstanding performers for the team, after winning the Man of the Match in Ghana's first game at the tournament.</p>
      <p>He scored in the penalty defeat to Ivory Coast after netting late in the game to keep the scores level.</p>
      <p>The Black Meteors have not qualified for the Olympic games since Athens 2004.</p>
