      <p>One day after the Trail Blazers welcomed Carmelo Anthony back to the NBA, the team is removing a different veteran from its roster.Portland waived Pau Gasol on Wednesday. The 18-year big man signed with the team as a free agent over the offseason, but he has had trouble rehabbing his surgically repaired foot and has not played this season. Gasol joined the Bucks last season after being bought out by the Spurs, but he appeared in three games for Milwaukee before suffering a season-ending foot injury.</p>
      <p>Despite having never played for the Trail Blazers, Gasol said that he and the team are looking into ways in which he can contribute while he continues to rehab. According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28124662/blazers-waive-pau-gasol-coaching-role-consideration">ESPN</a>, that could come via a coaching role.</p>
      <p> Still, the goal is for him to eventually continue his playing career.</p>
      <p>“I have the same excitement and passion for the game of basketball that I had when I first started playing and I will work as hard as I can on my recovery with a clear goal in mind: to get healthy in order to continue to play the game I love,” Gasol said in <a href="https://twitter.com/paugasol/status/1197276671763722242?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197276671763722242&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oregonlive.com%2Fblazers%2F2019%2F11%2Ftrail-blazers-waive-pau-gasol-who-is-considering-moving-into-a-coaching-role.html">a video posted to Twitter</a>. “While I continue in Portland, I am excited to – together, with the Trail Blazers organization – explore how I can contribute to the team from a different role not yet defined. I am very grateful and flattered by their desire to find ways to continue to work together.”</p>
      <p>It’s easy to see why the Trail Blazers would want to keep Gasol around. A two-time NBA champion and six-time All-Star, the 39-year-old has an abundance of knowledge to offer a team that came into the season with championship aspirations. Portland, however, is off to a 5-10 start, thanks in large part to injuries.</p>
      <p>Failing health, especially among the team’s forwards, was one of the reasons why Anthony was brought in after a year away from the league.</p>
      <p>Now, it remains to be seen if and when Gasol will return to an NBA floor – as a player anyway. After nearly two decades in the league with the Grizzlies, Lakers, Bulls, Spurs and Bucks, Gasol has accumulated 20,894 points and 11,305 rebounds. He has averaged 17.0 points and 9.2 rebounds per game.</p>
