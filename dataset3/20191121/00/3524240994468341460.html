      <p><b>Glasgow Rangers</b> face risk of losing their most in-form midfielder Joe Aribo when the January transfer reopens, <i>Sports Extra </i>reports.</p>
      <p>According to a report on <i>HITC,</i> three European clubs Southampton, Nice and Bayer Leverkusen are believed to be interested in the 23-year-old, who has been outstanding for both club and country in the last four months.</p>
      <p>The Nigeria international has scored five times and provided three assists in 23 appearances this term for Rangers.</p>
      <p>“Rangers fans love him (Aribo) but his form and the goals have dried up a little in recent weeks (due to injuries and national team commitments),” a report on <i>HITC</i> revealed.</p>
      <p>“There was a tone of interest from English clubs and if he picks up over the coming months, Rangers would have a challenge keeping hold of him,” the report further added.</p>
      <p>The Camberwell-born midfielder joined Rangers from Charlton Athletic last summer and is committed to Ibrox till 2023. He has been capped four times by Nigeria and has scored twice.</p>
