      <p>There are two essential camps that you saw with Google Stadia reviews, which went live earlier in the week. There were those that were impressed with the tech, said that it worked for them, but were doubtful that the launch features or business model could ever propel this thing to actual success. And then there were those that said that it didn’t work at all, and that it’s business model was bad to boot. And then after that wave of professional reviews, we’ve also got the first user reactions, which are mostly customers upset with largely botched pre-order shipments. Notably absent from basically this entire conversation: anything positive. Google Stadia’s launch, at this point, is a disaster. The question now becomes: what happens next?Here are a few potential scenarios. Some, but not all, are mutually exclusive.</p>
      <p><b>1) Google Stadia gets less bad: </b>This is what I would call a non-impossible scenario. But it’s clear that at this point Google chose to launch Stadia as a minimum viable product, and it’s entirely possible that it could gradually improve over the course of a year or two. First up is tech, which clearly needs work for a lot of players but definitely needs improvement for many others. It’s hard, on the outside, to know just how far away we are from a consistent product. But the fact that it does work for some people can make one hopeful.</p>
      <p>And then there’s the whole rest of it, which needs a ton of work as well. Google badly needs a pricing model that isn’t just “pay $60 for games you don’t own”, ideally a subscription of the kind its competition is bringing to the board. And it needs to do a much better job of explaining to people what this is, and why they should play it. It also needs to select its games a little bit better: split-second games like <i>Mortal Kombat 11</i> and even <i>Destiny 2</i> were an obviously bad choice for launch, where more forgiving games could have done a better job headlining.</p>
      <p>Assuming that Google makes better communications and pricing choices(a big assumption, but still), the problems here then become technical/geographic. The main thing I’m worried about here is that the United States is a gigantic market with some pretty intractable problems, like relative density of high-speed internet, the high cost of the plans that do exist and the presence of data caps that can render the data hungry Stadia essentially unworkable. These are not problems that Google can solve on its own.</p>
      <p><b>2) Stadia putters along for a little while before fizzling out: </b>This is another not-impossible scenario. Without a big change, Stadia locks itself into a familiar vicious cycle: people don’t want to buy games unless they have the confidence that the platform is going to be around in a few years’ time, and the company can’t fully commit unless people buy games. A new platform can fizzle before it gets started due to this feedback loop.</p>
      <p>I don’t think Stadia will go away this year, or next year, or the year after that. The base model isn’t even out yet, and Google has time to give this another shot. But if it can’t find its footing among increasing competition a few years down the line, it’s definitely easy to imagine that Google would pull the plug. That would be a major problem</p>
      <p>Here’s the thing: the possibility of this scenario does damage whether or not it actually comes to pass. Google has a reputation for abandoning ambitious projects, and this perception has been one of the new service’s chief problems since it was announced. People are afraid to buy games because they don’t have confidence that the service is around for the long haul, and that makes it harder to get off the ground.</p>
      <p><b>3) Microsoft Xcloud eats Stadia for breakfast:</b> This is a more possible scenario, in my book. Google isn’t the only tech giant getting into the streaming game: Microsoft is in the mix too, and it’s doing so with a near-infinite better understanding of the gaming space.</p>
      <p>Microsoft’s Xcloud is getting good reviews in a private beta, though that’s much more tightly controlled than Stadia’s now-wide launch. But the key here is that Microsoft isn’t positioning it as a stand-alone product. It’s part of an extant gaming ecosystem, which means that it has a whole lot more wiggle room than Stadia. And it’s pricing system is going to revolve around Microsoft Game Pass, which is already a somewhat absurdly good value for Xbox and PC players. It’s much closer to that age-old “Netflix of games” concept that it seemed like Google wanted to sell but couldn’t quite manage. Microsoft even has a solo suite of exclusive games to sweeten the pot, and it’s been on an aggressive studio buying spree that should be expanding that library considerably in the near-future.</p>
      <p>Stadia’s problems surrounding access to high speed internet and data caps will also be a problem for Microsoft. But Microsoft’s broader presence in the gaming space gives it ways to offer even those players value even if the streaming isn’t quite up to par yet, giving it significantly more wiggle room compared to Stadia.</p>
      <p>There are other competitors here: Amazon will still launch its own games streaming service, and Sony already has PlayStation Now. But Microsoft hits a sweet spot between reach, data infrastructure and extant presence in gaming, and that’s why it’s my best bet for the first company to make streaming happen.</p>
      <p><b>3) This whole thing returns to the back burner: </b>Remember when this happened before? Onlive promised to eliminate consoles back at the beginning of the decade, but things just weren’t in place yet to make it happen and the company went under. Streaming headed to the back burner while larger companies tinkered with it, and now it’s coming back.</p>
      <p>Could that happen again this time? Maybe to a certain degree, but I doubt this will go away entirely. It’s clearly a useful enough technology for a large enough number of customers that it’s going to stick around to some degree, but the question will be just what that degree is. I’m still guessing that streaming is going to be a widespread, easy way for a ton of people to play games by the time the next theoretical console generation either comes along or doesn’t. The question will be whether or not it finds large-scale adoption sooner than that.</p>
