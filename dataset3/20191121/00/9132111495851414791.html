      <p>The National Democratic Congress (NDC) did not show up for discussions on the draft roadmap to address political vigilantism.</p>
      <p>The NDC, one of the main stakeholders in the discussions, was absent due to circumstances beyond its control, according to the National Peace Council.</p>
      <p>The council’s chair, Professor Emmanuel Asante, however, added that the NDC has received a copy of the draft roadmap.</p>
      <p>“They [the NDC] are fully aware that this document is being discussed. The outcome will be conveyed to them and a date will be set for the public signing after we have endorsed it.”</p>
      <p>The National Peace Council called on the New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the NDC to honestly endorse and adopt the Draft Roadmap and Code of Conduct on political vigilantism.</p>
      <p>By the end of the deliberations, the NPP had accepted the roadmap in principle.</p>
      <p>This outcome is expected to be conveyed to the NDC.</p>
      <p>The document has been developed by a Technical Committee as part of ongoing dialogue aimed at ending political vigilantism.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the commencement of today’s dialogue, Prof Asante said the document will assist existing legislations and other frameworks on ending the vigilantism.</p>
      <p>The dialogue was instituted by the National Peace Council following the events that violence that erupted at the Ayawaso West Wuogon Constituency by-election.</p>
      <p>Though there were initial bumps between the NDC and the NPP, both parties have said they are committed to ending political vigilantism.</p>
      <p>In line with tackling vigilantism, President Nana Akufo-Addo gave his assent to the Vigilantism and Related Offences Act, 2019 in September, which bans acts of vigilantism in the country.</p>
      <p>The Act also disbands vigilante groups, including political party vigilante groups and land guards.</p>
      <p>Per the law: “a person who directly or indirectly instigates or solicits the activity of a vigilante, facilitates or encourages vigilantism, or conceals a vigilante to avoid lawful arrest, commits an offence, and is liable, on conviction, to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years and not more than 15 years.”</p>
