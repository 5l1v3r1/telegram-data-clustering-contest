        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>George Kent, deputy assistant secretary at the State Department, alledgedly overheard a July 26 phone call between President Trump and Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, in which the two discussed investigations that President Trump wanted Ukraine to pursue. Mr. Kent also said Mr. Trump told Mr. Sondland that Mr. Trump didn’t care about Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Right or wrong, Mr. Kent is simply upset that he was not in the loop. What the Democrats did was give Mr. Kent his 15 minues of fame while destroying any chance of normal relations with Ukraine. So much for the motives of the State Department.</p>
