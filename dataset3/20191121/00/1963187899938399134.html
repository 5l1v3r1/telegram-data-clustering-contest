      <p>BANGKOK - 21 November 2019: Pope Francis called for migrants to be made welcome and women and children to be protected from exploitation, abuse and enslavement as he began a busy two days of activities in Thailand on Thursday, the Bangkok Post reported. <br/><br/>"May every nation devise effective means for protecting the dignity and rights of migrants and refugees, who face dangers, uncertainties and exploitation in their quest for freedom and a decent life for their families,'' he said. <br/><br/>The Pope pleaded for action against one of the region's greatest scourges, human trafficking to fuel the forced labor and sex trade industries, as he began a week-long visit to Asia. <br/><br/>Francis praised the Thai government's efforts to fight human trafficking in a speech delivered at host Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's Government House offices, appealing for greater international commitment to protect women and children "who are violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse''. <br/><br/>He called for ways to "uproot this evil and to provide ways to restore their dignity''. <br/><br/>"The future of our peoples is linked in large measure to the way we will ensure a dignified future to our children,'' he said</p>
