      <p>The Duplex AI-powered assistant for booking announced back at Google's I/O this year and now the tech giant is expanding its functionality. The service can now search and book online tickets without you being actively involved the process.</p>

      <p>You don't have to go through the rather painful process of filling up forms no more as the assistant will do that for you. You just have to summon it and say what movie you want to watch in your area or just do it over the standard Google search on your phone.</p>
      <p>The assistant will do the rest and just ask you to choose seats and pay for the actual tickets. That's it. It will use your personal information saved to Chrome to fill out all the necessary forms.</p>
      <p>So far, the assistant works with 70 theaters and ticket agent websites with some of them being AMC, Fandango and MJR for the United States and Odeon in the UK.</p>
