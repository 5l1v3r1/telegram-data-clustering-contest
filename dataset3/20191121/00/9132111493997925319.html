      <p>Assin Central Member of Parliament (MP), Kennedy Ohene Agyapong has lamented that MPs are the least respected persons in the country.</p>
      <p>According to him, Ghanaians consider ‘people who carry toilet’ as people who ought to be respected because they fear the consequences that may result if they fail to obey them.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the same Ghanaians do not have same level of respect for MPs and Assembly men because ‘they see us people who came to them begging for their mandate to lead them’.</p>
      <p>“Let’s be honest, MP and Assemblyman are two stupid jobs in this country, people do not respect any of these people. Ghanaians tend to respect people who carry toilets than MPs and Assembly men all because they know they will face dire consequences when they mocked such people…,” he said.</p>
      <p>The maverick politician said it is for this reason that common fund allocated to MPs are never enough to carry out any meaningful development.</p>
