      <p>Black Stars Head Coach, James Kwasi Appiah is expected to tell his life story cum the journey to his coaching career in a book scheduled to be launched in December – <b>Peacefmonline.com</b> can confirm.<br/><br/>Co-author of the book, Kyei Amoako has hinted with some artworks on various social media platforms the birth of the book with the title - “Leaders Don’t Have to Yell”.<br/><br/>The 400-page book as our sources gathered will allow readers to learn more about one of the most well-known figures in Ghana. The book has also been categorized as a leadership memoir, and has for its subtitle “National Team Coach on Leading High-Performing Teams.”<br/><br/>Having been on the Ghana football scene since the early 1980s, calm-mannered Kwasi Appiah can be expected to have a lot to talk about regarding leading high-performing teams in his book. <br/><br/>Coach Kwasi Appiah captained both Kumasi Asante Kotoko and the Black Stars during his playing career and is in his second tenure as the Black Stars coach. Whether he remains the Black Stars gaffer after his current contract expires in December is unclear. <br/><br/>On the back of the book, Appiah shares why he wrote the book. A portion of what he said is included below:<br/><br/><i>“Very few people have had the opportunity to walk the path that my life has taken. As a result, I have seen things that only a few people have seen; I have had experiences that only a few people have had; and I have perspectives that only a few people have. Until now, the stories about the things I have seen, the experiences I have had and my perspectives on issues have been shared with only a relatively small group of people. So, as I thought about what purpose a book from me will serve, I became convinced that the time to commit my experiences and ideas into writing is now."</i><br/><br/>Appiah continues with what he hopes readers will get from reading the book:<br/><br/><i>“While my stories and perspectives are mainly from the world of football, I hope that the lessons and the inspiration they provide will be useful to footballers, coaches, and administrators, as well as to the fans and those who have little or no interest in football.”</i><br/><br/>The book’s foreword is written by journalist and SWAG President Kwabena Yeboah.<br/>In a conversation with the book’s co-author, Kyei Amoako indicated that the book will be launched with events in Kumasi, Sunyani and Accra in December, and additional information will be forthcoming. A form for media and general inquiries about the book is available at the book’s website, www.CoachKwasiAppiahBook.com.</p>
