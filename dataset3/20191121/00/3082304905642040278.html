        <b>Borussia Dortmund must put their Bayern Munich loss behind them, head coach Lucien Favre said.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lucien Favre urged Borussia Dortmund to forget their Der Klassiker humbling as they prepare to host Paderborn on Friday.</p>
      <p>Dortmund were crushed 4-0 by Bayern Munich in their final game before the international break and are sixth in the Bundesliga table.</p>
      <p>Favre, who is under pressure at the helm, is eager for Dortmund to put that result behind them as they prepare to resume their campaign.</p>
      <p>“We played badly against Bayern Munich, that is clear,” the head coach told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“We still had the previous victory against Inter [in the Champions League] fresh in our minds. Not all players, but some.</p>
      <p>“But such a loss can happen. We have to look ahead. We still have eight games, we have to keep going and think about our performance from game to game.”</p>
      <p>Thomas Delaney (ankle) has been ruled out until January for Dortmund, while Favre was unsure about Nico Schulz’s availability but said Marco Reus trained “OK” during the week.</p>

      <p>With the international break over, Favre wants Dortmund focused on club duties for the rest of 2020.</p>
      <p>“We still have eight games until Christmas. We have to focus on those games,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We have six league games and two Champions League games. Dortmund will be their sole focus now until the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“The players should no longer have their national teams in mind. That is important.”</p>
      <p>Dortmund are sixth in the Bundesliga, but just six points off league leaders Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
