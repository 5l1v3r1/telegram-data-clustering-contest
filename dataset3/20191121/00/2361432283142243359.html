      <h1>'This Is Us' Thanksgiving Gobbles Up 15% Better Ratings Than Last Week</h1>
      <h2>ABC’s “Emergence” suffers a Nielsen emergency</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:22:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tony-maglio/" target="_blank">Tony Maglio</a></address>
      <p>NBC is thankful for “This Is Us.” Tuesday’s midseason finale, this fall’s Thanksgiving episode, rose 15% in ratings from the prior week’s episode. The installment, titled “So Long, Marianne,” saw the Pearsons, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) in particular, face an uncomfortable truth about Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and ended in a twisty flash-forward sequence.</p>
      <p>Further down the Nielsen sheets, “Emergence” settled for series lows both among adults 18-49 and in terms of total viewers. ABC settled for fourth.</p>
      <p>NBC was first in ratings with a 1.2 rating/6 share in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic and second in total viewers with an average of 7 million, according to preliminary numbers. “The Voice” at 8 p.m. posted a 1.3 rating/6 and 8.2 million viewers. At 9, “This Is Us” landed a 1.5/7 and 7.3 million viewers. “New Amsterdam” at 10 had a 0.8/4 and 5.5 million viewers.</p>
