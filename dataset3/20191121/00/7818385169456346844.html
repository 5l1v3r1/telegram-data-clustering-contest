      <p>Following reports of massive layoffs worldwide by coworking space company WeWork, the company began downsizing its Israel research and development center on Thursday, according to one person familiar with the matter who spoke to Calcalist on condition of anonymity. According to the person, 67 of the company’s employees in the country, most of them on its development team, were called in for pre-layoff hearings.</p>
      <p>Once the process is complete, WeWork will have about 250 remaining employees in Israel, 150 of them developers. The person estimated there will not be a second layoff wave in the country.</p>
