      <h1>Seven things worth splurging on</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Carrick</a></address>
      <p>There is endless talk about the saving and investing side of personal finance, but not about spending. Can we spend smarter?</p>
      <p>A recent thread on Reddit offers some ideas on smart spending. The question that started the discussion: “What upgrade was totally worth the price?” A few notable responses were gathered together on the <a href="https://twocents.lifehacker.com/when-spending-the-extra-money-is-worth-it-according-to-1839784618">Lifehacker blog</a>, and they’re worth a look because, for the most part, they’re quite affordable. The list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A good backpack</li>
        <li>Wireless headphones</li>
        <li>Paying for movers instead of doing it yourself</li>
        <li>Quality sheets</li>
        <li>A phone charger with a longer cable</li>
        <li>Better garbage bags</li>
        <li>Living alone instead of having a roommate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are a few splurges I find to be worth the money:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A warm winter jacket</li>
        <li>Good coffee. Not lattes etc., just a quality cup</li>
        <li>Vacations (take fewer trips, go to more interesting places)</li>
        <li>A decent bottle of bourbon</li>
      </ul>
      <p>High levels of household debt tell us people are overspending widely in their lives. One way to throttle back on spending would be to splurge strategically. Buy the utility grade of products you don’t care about, and splurge on a few affordable things you take pleasure in.</p>

        <b>RESPs: Individual or family plan?</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the most common questions I get about registered education savings plans is whether it’s better to open an individual or family plan. Here’s some info to help you make the <a href="https://www.genymoney.ca/family-resp-vs-individual-resp-which-one-is-better/">best pick</a> for your situation.</p>

        <b>Ask Rob</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Q:</b> Rather than gambling on one of the various marijuana companies, I bought an exchange-traded fund, HMMJ, thinking it would be safer. The shares are now worth less than 50 per cent of what they were. Would you wait it out or give up?</p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I would give up, take the loss and reinvest the money in something else. Probably a Canadian market equity ETF. That’s no comment on the prospects for cannabis stocks, a sector I know little about. Rather, it would be a way to get away from speculation on a narrow market niche and back to diversified long-term investing.</p>
