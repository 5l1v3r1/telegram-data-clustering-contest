      <h1>Carrying on good work Jarvie's goal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/Jeff%20Cheshire" target="_blank">Jeff Cheshire</a></address>
      <p>Continue the good work, stay sustainable and find opportunities to grow.</p>
      <p>That is what Lauren Jarvie hopes to achieve in her time at the Otago Rowing Association.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old began as its new general manager on Monday.</p>
      <p>She takes over from Mitch Carroll, who is working alongside Jarvie until the Otago championships in December when she moves to Wellington.</p>
      <p>While still getting a feel for the job, Jarvie was excited to get going.</p>
      <p>She said the sport was special in Otago and she hoped to help it continue to flourish.</p>
      <p>''Quite honestly, my initial thoughts are to carry on the good work. Mitch has done such an outstanding job.</p>
      <p>''They value Mitch really highly within the rowing community.</p>
      <p>''So my first goal is to continue that, but also keep an eye and a view to what other opportunities there are, whether there's some growth opportunities.</p>
      <p>''The funding landscape has changed and what does that look like for rowing?</p>
      <p>''Just ensuring we secure that really good financial future for rowing.</p>
      <p>''And just making sure we continue to provide outstanding rowers as well, so as a region we can be proud of what we produce.''</p>
      <p>Jarvie brings plenty of experience from the sporting sector to the role.</p>
      <p>She has had two stints at Sport Otago - including her most recent job as a community sport adviser - as well as being a community recreation adviser at the Dunedin City Council.</p>
      <p>Netball has also figured largely and she is the deputy chairwoman of Dunedin Netball.</p>
      <p>''I just absolutely love working in sport. It's something I'll stick with.</p>
      <p>''You work with such good people and you're just working on positive good news stuff all the time.</p>
      <p>''I really enjoy it.''</p>
      <p>She felt sport was special to Otago as a whole, although she also felt that each sport had its own unique characteristics as well.</p>
      <p>Rowing was new to her, although she had heard plenty of stories from Carroll through working at Sport Otago.</p>
      <p>She felt it was a sport viewed as doing ''really well'' and that had been key in her decision to take the job.</p>
      <p>''The ability to work directly with a sport that means something to the people in Otago, that we do really well in.</p>
      <p>''It has good structures but also opportunity for growth and wanting to explore that in time, what we can capitalise on and how we can secure that future for rowing.''</p>
