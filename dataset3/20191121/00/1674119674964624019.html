        <b>Chris Berrow and Leigh Milner review Pokemon Shield... </b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris - Now there's a few different things about Pokemon sort of Pokemon shield the only one that matters for me is that in Pokemon Shield there's a Pokemon called Ponyta and the pokemon shield version is a pink fluffy unicorn. Yeah. Version. Yeah. Right. So that's why we got that version. Call them Pokemon fund what you got for me.</p>
      <p>Leigh - I haven't stopped playing it.</p>
      <p>Chris - You were literally falling asleep fell asleep with it in my hands. I know that had just been a radio for talking about stadia. I know this is your priority this is your priority. I got straight home into IP JS and played Pokémon. And how are you doing at pokemon.</p>
      <p>Leigh - I love it so I've got a new strategy because obviously I played all the Gameboy games yet. This time I'm trying to catch them all so I finally get it.<br/> </p>
