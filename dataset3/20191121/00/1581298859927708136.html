      </p>
      <p>All local governments must have a plan to outline how they will make their services, buildings and information accessible for people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>Once the plan has been endorsed by council, a reference group will be formed to assist in the development of an implementation plan to outline specific actions and improvement measures.</p>
      <p>The shire has said those strategies would not be 'set in stone' for the next five years.</p>
      <p>The plan is reviewed annually and can be updated at any time to reflect needs.</p>
      <p>If you would like to be part of the reference group call 9042 0346 or email shire@esperance.wa.gov.au</p>
      <p>A copy of the plan is <a href="https://www.esperance.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication/files/draft_-_disability_access_and_inclusion_plan_-_v4.pdf">available online here</a> and can be obtained from the Shire's Administration Building.</p>
      <p>Submissions on the plan can be sent to the shire's PO Box at 507, Esperance, WA 6450 or emailed to shire@esperance.wa.gov.au by 4pm Tuesday, December 10.</p>
