      <h1>Investor sentiment is worsening. Be bullish (podcast)</h1>

      <p>The collective mood and risk appetite of investors may be turning more cautious, but this makes for a more optimistic outlook for risk assets. The author of the <a href="https://demonetizedblog.com/">Demonetized Blog</a> (and corresponding <a href="https://twitter.com/demonetizedblog">Twitter account</a>) joined the <a href="http://contrarian.libsyn.com/investors-worsening-mood-is-a-bullish-indicator-nick-from-demonetized-blog">Contrarian Investor Podcast </a>this week to discuss this concept and what it means for the economy and markets going forward. Nick, who writes the blog, requested that his last name not be used in the podcast.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2019/11/21/investor-optimism-pulls-back-below-40/#5755d7ac4438">latest investor surveys</a> are pointing to decreased risk appetite and a return of pessimism. Counterintuitively, this actually makes for a more bullish outlook where risk assets like equities are concerned. There is a "basic principle" at work that broader conservative positioning makes for a more bullish outlook, says Nick.</p>

      <p>Of course, timing is everything. How much longer does this bull market have to run? Nick sees no immediate end in sight. Other than manufacturing, U.S. economic indicators are positive. Interest rates should stay low indefinitely and the economy is not facing an imminent recession.</p>
      <p>A new presidential administration in the U.S. could be a cause for concern, but Nick cautions against expecting too much from political developments, citing the initial market reaction to President Trump’s election victory in 2016. “It’s difficult to imagine the market responding very positively to an Elizabeth Warren win in the election, given her policy positions,” he says. “But you just never know at the end of the day...these things don’t always play out the way you think.”</p>
      <p>What this all means for asset allocation? Equities may remain the best game in town and certain commodity-linked securities bear watching. “Metals and gold in particular could be at the beginning of a big move,” Nick says. Gold mining companies, could be interesting. The recent (disappointing) performance of gold bullion may present an entry point. “I think there could be an interesting setup taking place there.”</p>
      <p>Inflationary pressures would also help prices of precious metals, as well as real estate. While the immediate outlook for inflation continues to be benign, Nick has “very little faith that policy makers can control inflationary pressures well once it starts to build.” Central banks and others continue to complain about low inflation. Be careful what you wish for, says Nick.</p>
