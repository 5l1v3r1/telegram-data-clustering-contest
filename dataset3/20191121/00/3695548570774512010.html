        <b>The Venturi Racing Formula E squad has signed a three-year title sponsorship deal with Williams Formula 1 sponsor and telecommunications company ROKiT.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Venturi - now a Mercedes customer team - will run in a new red and black livery for the 2019-20 season as part of the new deal.</p>
      <p>The team ran in a temporary white livery in pre-season testing at Valencia last month.</p>
      <p>Signing a title sponsor is the latest step in Venturi's three-season development programme, which included hiring Susie Wolff as team principal ahead of last season, and switching to a Mercedes powertrain supply arrangement for 2019-20.</p>
      <p>"It's a proud moment for us that ROKiT has chosen to join us in Formula E, but it's also a very defining moment that a big sponsor in Formula 1 has also chosen to enter the Formula E platform," Wolff told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"Because that shows just how much momentum the platform is starting to gleam."</p>
      <p>Regarding Venturi's sponsor ambitions for the new season, Wolff said "There were a number of discussions going on, but I was quite confident that we weren't going to go into season six without a partner on board", and explained the deal with ROKiT came together recently.</p>
      <p>"It was a really important part of the jigsaw for year two [of the development programme]," she added.</p>
      <p>"Because to go racing and with the potential that we have in the team, it seemed such a shame not to have a proper partner on board to share the platform with.</p>
      <p>"I got to know Jonathan [Kendrick, ROKiT co-founder] only around one week ago and he's an incredible entrepreneur, who, very much like Gildo [Pastor, Venturi president], is a pioneer and a visionary.</p>
      <p>"The brand fits perfectly, there's a lot of synergies with the Formula E platform."</p>
      <p>Kendrick explained that FE's city-centre race locations was "the big key" to ROKiT getting involved so that it can showcase its connectivity technology to the electric championship's audience.</p>
      <p>"[ROKiT] technology is going to change the world and how we communicate within cities, and that's the clever thing about it - it's so inexpensive, everybody can now have access," said Kendrick.</p>
      <p>"I made up my mind in the first 10 minutes - that this is where I want to be.</p>
      <p>"I just believe in Susie, I like her strength. I know her history obviously, but she's very determined.</p>
      <p>"It's literally been a week [since the first meeting] - and I would say the second day, which is ridiculously fast, she'd got all the logos sorted out, the car sorted out, the team kit.</p>
      <p>"So to me that was like, 'Wow, they really are very professional this team'."</p>
      <p>Venturi will enter the 2019-20 season, which starts on Friday in Riyadh, with Felipe Massa and Edoardo Mortara as its driver line-up for a second consecutive campaign.</p>
