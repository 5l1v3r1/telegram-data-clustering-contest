      <p>Investing.com - U.S. futures were down slightly as trade tensions remained in focus after reports that <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/economy/china-invites-us-trade-negotiators-for-new-round-of-talks-wsj-2025112">China has invited Washington for face-to-face talks in Beijing</a>.</p>
