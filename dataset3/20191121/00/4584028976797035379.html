      <h1>Leading RusAF officials charged with anti-doping violations</h1>

      <p>The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has suspended several leading Russian Athletics Federation (RusAF) officials for their conduct during an investigation into high-jumper Danil Lysenko.</p>
      <p>Russian athletes have been prohibited from representing their country since November 2015 following allegations of state-sponsored doping, which have been regularly denied.</p>
      <p>Lysenko, a high jump silver medallist from the 2017 World Athletics Championships, was authorised by World Athletics to compete as a neutral athlete following the suspension of RusAF.</p>
      <p>In June 2018, Lysenko was notified of a third "whereabouts" failure, with a notice of charge issued against him and a provisional suspension imposed in August 2018.</p>
      <p>The AIU investigated the explanations provided by Lysenko, concluding the explanations were false and supported by forged documents.</p>
      <p>A subsequent 15-month inquiry into RusAF's conduct has led to senior officials, including the organisation's president Dmitry Shlyakhtin, being charged with serious breaches of anti-doping rules, including a failure to co-operate with an investigation and obstructing an investigation.</p>
      <p>In total, seven individuals associated with RusAF – Shlyakhtin, executive director Alexander Parkin, board member Artur Karamyan, senior administrator Elena Orlova, anti-doping coordinator Elena Ikonnikova, Lysenko and his coach Evgeniy Zagorulko – have been charged for anti-doping rule violations of tampering and/or complicity.</p>
      <p>All seven have been handed suspensions with immediate effect.</p>
      <p>RusAF has until December 12 to respond to the notice, and the AIU board may refer the matter to the World Athletics Council.</p>
