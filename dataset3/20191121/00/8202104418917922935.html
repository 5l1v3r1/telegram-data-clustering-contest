      <h3>Contract talks between teachers and the provincial government are headed to conciliation after the parties failed to make meaningful progress on two key issues at the bargaining table.</h3>
      <p>The Saskatchewan Teachers’ Federation <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/sask-teachers-declare-impasse-ask-for-conciliation">declared an impasse last week</a> and asked the provincial Education Relations Board to establish a three-member conciliation board to attempt to resolve the dispute.</p>
      <p>The STF and the government remain far apart on compensation, and entrenched on whether a mechanism to ensure classrooms are adequately resourced will be included in the teachers’ next collective agreement.</p>
      <p>While the STF maintains that is the only way to address class size and composition issues, the government insists doing so would create “chaos” and has launched a parallel process to address what both sides agree is a problem.</p>
      <p>Both sides have until Friday to nominate someone to the conciliation board; after that, their nominees will nominate someone who will serve as chair, responsible for attempting to guide the parties toward a resolution.</p>
      <p>While the STF expects four days of hearings, timing depends on the still-to-be-named chair’s availability. The process can result in a tentative agreement, further negotiations between the parties, or no meaningful progress.</p>
      <p>Conciliation has been used, with varying results, in previous rounds of negotiations.</p>
      <p>In an unusual move its president says was intended to ensure both sides made reasonable offers, the STF committed to make bargaining details public — and the provincial government has followed suit with its own updates.</p>
      <p>What has emerged shows deep divisions between the two sides.</p>
      <p><a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/teachers-deem-government-salary-proposal-unacceptable">The government is offering teachers a $1,500 cash bonus funded from their health plan, plus two per cent raises in 2020 and 2021; the STF wants a two per cent raise in 2019, followed by three per cent wage hikes in 2020 and 2021</a>.</p>
      <p>Both sides have dug in their heels on class size and composition, with the STF refusing to participate in the government process and saying its members won’t be “<a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/teachers-wont-be-bought-off-on-class-size-composition-stf">bought off</a>” with a generous salary issue.</p>
      <p>Education Minister Gord Wyant has said the government committee, which has also been panned by the Saskatchewan NDP, will proceed without teacher involvement and <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/government-aims-to-have-class-size-composition-fix-by-budget-time">aim to have a solution before the next budget</a>.</p>
      <p>That position is understood to be a significant test of teachers’ resolve.</p>
