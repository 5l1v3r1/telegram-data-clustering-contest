      <h1>SoftBank sounds out Japan's top banks on $2.8 billion loan, sources say</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/softbank-corp.">9984</a>) is sounding out Japan's top three banks to borrow around 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) to help fund its support of U.S. startup WeWork, three people familiar with the matter said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>While official talks haven't started yet, SoftBank has approached its main bank Mizuho Financial Group Inc (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/mizuho-financial-group,-inc.">8411</a>), as well as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/mitsubishi-ufj-financial-group-(to)">8306</a>) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/sumitomo-mitsui-financial">8316</a>), the sources said.</p>
      <p>All three sources declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the record.</p>
      <p>A SoftBank spokeswoman said that a loan was one of its options but nothing had been decided yet. All three banks declined to comment.</p>
      <p>SoftBank agreed in October to offer a $9.5 billion lifeline to take control of WeWork.</p>
      <p>SoftBank has provided Japanese banks with a rare profit opportunity at home, where they are largely hamstrung by ultra-low interest rates. But Japan's top three lenders have also become more cautious about financing the conglomerate, bankers say, given the turmoil over WeWork.</p>
      <p>"We have to be very careful about this," one of the sources said. "Especially if the money goes to WeWork, it will take a long time to conclude the process."</p>
      <p>SoftBank fell earlier this month to its first quarterly loss in 14 years, dragged down by an $8.9 billion hit at its giant Vision Fund, as CEO Masayoshi Son admitted poor investment judgment and turning a blind eye to problems at startup WeWork.</p>
      <p>The potential bank loan was first reported by the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/japan-ni225">Nikkei</a>.</p>
