        <b>David Villa announced first announced his retirement a few days ago, with both teammates and rivals praising him for his contribution to football. Now, he has spoken to Spanish newspaper 'Marca' to take a look at his career. The player has stated that his time with "La Roja" is what he cherishes most after a stellar career.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For me, <b>Spain has been everything</b>. When I was a child I was a member of Sporting de Gijón, which was the team I saw in my homeland, and I also liked Barcelona... <b>but I always supported the national team</b>", David Villa looked back.</p>
      <p>"The first shirt I had was Spain's and I always dreamed of being a footballer in order to play for the national team. Over the years I've been able to play 98 games and, although there have been good times and bad, each of them has been a dream for me. <b>It's the best thing I've been able to do as a footballer: represent my country at big events,"</b> he continued.</p>

      <p>The 'Guaje', like all players, has <b>one last thing</b> <b>he would have liked to achieve</b>. "I would have <b>liked to have played in the Premier League</b>... or to <b>have won more titles</b>. The Champions League with Atlético or the Cup with Valencia... To have helped to promote Sporting. But I made decisions and it really would not be fair to complain about something I lacked with such a complete career.<b> I've been very lucky, I wouldn't change anything</b>," he said.</p>
      <p>Villa can still go on adding a title to his personal account. "It would be the icing on the cake. I announced that I was retiring, but I'm still in competition. I have three league matches left and, God willing, two Cups. We hope to reach the final and it would be fantastic to play a final in my last game and lift a Cup. <b>A perfect finishing touch to the race</b>," he wished.</p>
      <p>Villa hangs up his boots, but he will remain in the world of football. He will become the owner of a New York team. "We are very excited about this team in the district of Queens that will give us many joys. In addition, we will work in the Academies to give opportunities to the childrenso that they can have experience", he concluded.</p>
