      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-ann-inaba-falls-off-chair-dancing-with-the-stars">Carrie Ann Inaba</a> couldn't hold in her emotion after choosing to eliminate James Van Der Beek from "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/dancing-with-the-stars">Dancing With the Stars</a>."</p>
      <p>On Monday's episode of "DWTS," the actor, 42, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/james-van-der-beek-eliminated-dancing-with-the-stars-wife-suffers-miscarriage">revealed that his wife recently suffered a miscarriage</a>, before he was cut from the competition.</p>
      <p>"My wife Kimberly and I went through every expecting parent’s worst nightmare. We lost the baby,” Van Der Beek said in a video package. “The little soul that we had expected to welcome into our family took a shortcut to whatever lies beyond.”</p>

      <p>Just a month before, Van Der Beek <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/james-van-der-beek-announces-on-dancing-with-the-stars-wife-is-expecting-baby-no-6">announced the pregnancy</a> on an earlier episode.</p>
      <p>Host Tom Bergeron called the elimination the “hardest judge’s verdict so far this season," and that certainly seems to be the case for Inaba.</p>
      <p>The 51-year-old dancer spoke about the experience on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/tv">The Talk</a>."</p>

      <p>While it was difficult for Inaba to make that call, she explained that as a judge, her job is simply to evaluate the dancing.</p>
      <p>“I have so much sadness in my heart for them, and my prayers are with them,” Inaba said on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHbW5durlLA">Tuesday's episode</a>. “But, you know, this is when it’s really hard. As a judge, I have to judge the dance. I know on Dancing With the Stars we show their stories and we get to know them, and they become family, and their pain is my pain.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>She added: “I went home and I vomited.”</p>
      <p>Inaba also compared her experience on the show to judging competitions in the Olympics.</p>
      <p>"If something happens to somebody before they get on the gymnastics mat, it doesn’t matter what happens in your personal life. I have to judge what’s happening on the dance floor.”</p>
      <p>Co-host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/marie-osmond-gwen-stefani-halloween">Marie Osmond</a> also addressed backlash that Van Der Beek faced for spending time on the show rather than at home with his wife, praising his decision.</p>
      <p>"It just tells you what kind of a guy he is. He's a follow-through person, he's a finisher," Osmond, 60 said. "We all go through heartbreaking things in life, but you guys don't just say 'I'm not showing up for work today.'" I mean this is a huge competition and I admire him."</p>

      <p>"I think it shows his work ethic," the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/music">singer</a> continued. "Sometimes, too, you have to remember that those endorphins help you cope, and so I think we shouldn't judge him at all."</p>
