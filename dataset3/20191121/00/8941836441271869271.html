      <p>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) - A Maryland woman is accused of shoving a 76-year-old man to the ground, yanking his 4-year-old granddaughter from him and running off with the child.</p>
      <p>Montgomery County police say the bloody man screamed after the girl spirited away by the stranger, who was soon tracked to a nearby store. Police say she was found holding the unharmed girl behind a rack of clothes. The Washington Post reports 39-year-old Yashica Terry later told officers she thought the “vibe” was off between the man and the girl.</p>
      <p>Court records say the girl told police that she and “grandpa Ben” were walking to their car when an unknown woman snatched her away. Terry has been ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation and be held in jail without bond.</p>
