      <p>In a two-tower residence on the former site of Mount Sinai Hospital, this two-bedroom corner suite was listed for nearly $3-million this spring, then relisted for roughly $2.9-million this summer. During those times, two offers dissolved, but a $2.75-million bid was finalized in early July.</p>

      <p>“In this building – in the last two years – there’s only been three sales on MLS, and one I know of was off market, so there’s very low turnover in the building,” agent Dino Capocci said.</p>
      <p>“We knew we were a little high [on the asking price], so it took longer than usual to sell, but at that price, you don’t sell in a week.”</p>
      <h4>What they got</h4>

      <p>Situated in one corner of a nine-year-old high-rise, this roughly 1,700-square-foot unit is surrounded by nearly full height windows and three balconies overlooking the quaint boutiques on Scollard Street and Jesse Ketchum park and school.</p>
      <p>Interior appointments are modern and upscale, from a sleek gas fireplace in the living room to a spa-like ensuite and his and her closets in the master bedroom.</p>

      <p>The unit comes with two more bathrooms and laundry machines, plus a storage locker and parking. Monthly fees of $2,014 pay for water and heating, as well as a gym and pool.</p>
      <h4>The Agent’s take</h4>

      <p>“It’s a really rare unit because it’s a bright, light-filled corner unit with three terraces,” Mr. Capocci said.</p>
      <p>“It has a northwest view, so you can see the sun set.”</p>
      <p>High-end amenities and services are also within easy reach. “You can walk out to Yorkville Avenue, Scollard Street and Hazelton Lanes,” Mr. Capocci said.</p>
      <p>“And you have really high-end concierge and valet parking.”</p>
