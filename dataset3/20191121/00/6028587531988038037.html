      <p>At the <a href="https://distillery.bombaysapphire.com/">Bombay Sapphire Distillery</a> in Laverstoke, England 12 whip-smart mixologists are sitting in a room, listening intently as Marco Corallo, head bartender at the Langham Hotel’s <a href="https://www.artesian-bar.co.uk/">Artesian Bar</a>, shares his cocktail craft secrets. They scribble furiously, their faces are taut and attentive; indeed this is the most stressed I have ever seen people who work with booze. Their stress is justified as they are the regional finalists in Bombay Sapphire’s 13th annual Most Imaginative Bartender Competition. The finale in Chicago this coming February promises to be intense, especially with a grand prize of $25,000 on the line. Looking around the room I see an intriguing and eclectic group that includes everything from former ballerinas to high school valedictorians but only one, Atlanta-based Keyatta Mincey-Parker, is a mother of three, former model, and a Liberian refugee. The first time I met Mincey-Parker she was holding a shotgun. We were attempting to shoot clay pigeons at a local resort during one of the off-days of Bombay’s finalist immersion week. At 6’2” she makes for a very diverting image, put a gun in her hands and well, it’s imposing. I was immediately impressed. She confessed she really didn’t like guns but she needed to try shooting one and conquer her fear. I quickly discovered over the course of our stay that taking on challenges is a habit for Mincey-Parker.</p>
      <p>Certainly her first challenge in life was escaping the African nation of Liberia with her family. She recalls, “we left so quickly. I was 12 and sure that we would only be gone a short time. There have been wars before they blew over in a few months, but this grew into a 20 year war, and I have not been back.” As she describes it, one afternoon she was at home playing in her backyard when some child soldiers appeared, carrying guns, asking about her father. Later that night it was a mad dash to the airport to get a flight out and get to safety. After a quick stop in London, her parents made the decision to move the family to Atlanta (where her mother is originally from). As a newly-minted refugee, Mincey-Parker enrolled in the most ferocious of American social gauntlets, <i>middle school.</i> She is quick to add it was one of the hardest transitions ever. “When I realized that we weren’t going home I knew I needed to ditch my accent, so I sat in front of the TV watching 90210 and all that stuff. I was already tall, already awkward, didn’t have a perm, didn’t have a body. I sure didn’t need an accent.”</p>

      <p>Yet, she argues that life as a refugee makes you feel like you are stronger than you think you are. “You are not confined to a certain destiny because of your past. After high school she started modeling but eventually gravitated to hospitality where her mentor at the now-closed Trois restaurant recognized her creativity, talent and curiosity, pulled her from the hostess stand and put her behind the bar. She embraced the challenge and ultimately took control of the bar program. Today, she runs the bar program at <a href="http://www.bontonatl.com/">Bon Ton</a> in Atlanta, and as a Most Imaginative Bartender Finalist she has even greater challenges ahead.</p>
      <p>This year the Bombay Sapphire team has set up an impressive gauntlet for the finalists adding a new “Canvas Challenge” which requires all finalists to bring an original creative idea of any medium to life and explain it in a seven-minute pitch. In addition there is the Botanical Challenge which assigns each mixologist a botanical (in advance) and allows 15 minutes to create a cocktail from a designated pantry based on their botanical. </p>
      <p>And finally, each bartender must create a gin-based cocktail that embodies why they are the most imaginative bartender. Mincey-Parker is undaunted, “I’ll put in at least 100 hours on this cocktail. And forget about thinking outside the box, there is no box. I will try everything, if it doesn’t work, I’ll just keep going.”</p>
      <p>There are other unique challenges that she acknowledges make the pressure to succeed tremendous. “For me, I have this great opportunity and being African-American and female, taking on the pressure of my race and my gender, can be overwhelming. But during this experience the people I met were great. The atmosphere was very supportive, we all want success for each other.”</p>
      <p>The road to the final competition in Chicago is long, but Mincey-Parker is ready. She has seen her share of challenges and stared them down, plus she adds with resolve, “I am serious, I want to win, I am going to win. I have to put the time in to make it happen.” I like her chances. Gin is having a moment, and so is Mincey-Parker.</p>
