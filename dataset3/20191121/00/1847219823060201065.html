        <b>Latvia’s ex-president Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga believes there is no reason to dissolve the 13<sup>th</sup> Saeima.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the previous Saeima left some «cuckoo eggs» for the new parliament before leaving, such as something in legislation, this does not mean the current Saeima is to blame, says Vīķe-Freiberga.</p>
      <p>When asked if the ruling coalition in the Saeima made some mistake during the budget approval process and should the budget be returned for a repeated review, the ex-president stressed that all state institutions have to plan their work, continue their objectives and pay wages to their employees.</p>
      <h3>«Everything is the same as what is happening in USA – when the government’s work is being blocked, which has serious consequences. As a small country, we cannot afford such jokes. Absolutely not,» said the former president.</h3>
      <p>As previously reported, the Central Election Commission decided to register initiatives from <i>Varu Latvijas tautai</i> and C<i>entre Party</i> in November to commence signature collection to initiate the parliament’s dismissal. More than 30 000 people signed for this initiative on <i>Latvija.lv</i> portal.</p>
      <p>Signature collection process will end 14 November 2020. If the necessary number of people (154 865) vote in favour by then, a referendum will have to be held.</p>
