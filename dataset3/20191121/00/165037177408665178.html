      <p><b>Sevilla</b>'s previous 2 victories in<b> Valladolid </b>were last century: a 1-0 win in 1996-97 through a Onésimo goal and a 4-0 win in 94-95 thanks to a Suker double and goals from Moya and Quique Estebaranz.</p>
      <p>Valladolid's stadium hasn't been a particularly nice place for Sevilla, since <b>they have lost more than half of the 49 official matches played between the sides (25)</b>,<b> winning 12</b> and drawing the rest.</p>
