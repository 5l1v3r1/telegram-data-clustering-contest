      <p>Not long into Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential debate in Atlanta, it was apparent that at least one of the ten candidates on the stage had a major policy beef: America as the only industrialized nation in the world without a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/4/3/18286017/paid-family-leave-senate-sinema-cassidy">federal paid family leave program</a>.The solution, per longshot hopeful Andrew Yang: give every family that so deserves it, at least <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/paid-family-leave/">nine months off</a>.</p>
      <p>Which, when you think about it, might be a needed fix to these tedious debates, now that the fifth one is in the books.</p>
      <p>Rather than televise a debate every four weeks, let’s expand that hiatus to, say, eight weeks – well into the new year – and give the American people an early holiday gift.</p>
      <p>Here’s the problem with what went down in Atlanta, other than the question of equal time (the frontrunners got lots of air time, the back of the pack <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/candidate-speaking-time-tracker-november-2019-debates-n1087731">not so much</a>): it’s the sameness of the evenings.</p>
      <p>Each Democratic debate begins with an obligatory 15 minutes of Trump-bashing, during which Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (rightly) points out that there’s more to ousting the incumbent than demonstrable Trump animus. </p>
      <p>After that, the candidates rarely interacted (though there were a few flashpoints – Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker going at it <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/democratic-debate-cory-booker-elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-20191121.html">on the wealth tax</a>; Sen. Kamala Harris slamming Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-rips-tulsi-gabbard-fox-news-assad-2019-11">party-loathing, Fox News dupe</a>; Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden’s differences over <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cory-booker-questions-joe-bidens-stance-on-marijuana-at-the-georgia-democratic-debate-are-you-high">marijuana legalization</a>).</p>
      <p>If Wednesday night’s viewers made it past the 100-minute mark, they got a good 20-minute finish when the proceedings finally arrived at their assumed intent: at Tyler Perry Studios, talking about the societal troubles confronting Black America.</p>
      <p>Here, Harris had a good moment talking about health and justice, though she didn’t throw an expected roundhouse punch at South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, the field’s surging candidate despite <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/471349-pete-buttigieg-has-now-lost-all-confidence-from-black-voters">a jarring lack of minority support</a>.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, very little about the Democratic race seemingly changed during the two-hour debate. Buttigieg was expected to be treated roughly, as was Warren in October’s debate. He wasn’t, other than Gabbard questioning the young mayor’s national security choices (<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/buttigieg-open-to-deploying-us-troops-in-mexico">sending troops into Mexico</a>) near the debate’s end.</p>
      <p>Biden, as per usual, seemed . . . well, a little off. Asked about what he’d do for women, the candidate instead went into a meandering discourse on <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24471952.html">Slobodan Milosevic</a> and a long record than just didn’t tele-connect.</p>
      <p>Biden’s (maybe fatal) flaw: he’s over-reliant on one talking point – <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-campaign-pushes-foreign-policy-credentials-ad-impeachment/story?id=66923680">experience</a>. By repeatedly falling back on it, he comes across as a computer stuck in a loop.</p>
      <p>And there was a somewhat comical Biden gaffe – this time, not during the debate but <i>before</i> it when his campaign issued the obligatory “wasn’t he great?” email <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/20/biden-team-debate-fundraising-plea-2020-072212">hours before the event actually began</a>.</p>
      <p>As for Warren, she did better than the low bar she set in Ohio. Still, there’s a long-term problem with her core credibility. For example, Warren’s loathing of financial elites <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/democratic-debate-elizabeth-warren-defends-wealth-tax-tired-of-freeloading-billionaires-031040597.html">(“I’m tired of freeloading billionaires”</a>) that extends to getting wealth out of politics. That includes putting an end to donor-ambassadors, Warren vowed. However, <a href="https://freebeacon.com/politics/warren-helped-confirm-clueless-obama-bundlers-as-ambassadors/">her Senate record during the Obama years indicates otherwise</a>.</p>
      <p>To those who were scoring at home, here were two moments that stood out. One was this Buttigieg zinger: “Washington experience is not the only experience that matters. There’s more than 100 years of Washington experience on this stage and where are we right now as a country?”</p>
      <p>And this cringe-worthy comment by Harris: “It is no longer the case in America that people are having children in their 20’s.” California’s senator maybe isn’t familiar with a few of her constituents in Calabasas: the young and fertile Kardashians.</p>
      <p>For brevity’s sake, I won’t get into how each other of the candidates fared. Rather, I’d like to talk about the one Democrat who wasn’t in the audience – and rarely mentioned by the hopefuls: Barack Obama. </p>
      <p>As circumstance would have it, America’s 44<sup>th </sup>president has a scheduling conflict this week: he’s scheduled to speak Friday at the annual <a href="https://abc7news.com/business/dreamforce-2019-begins-in-san-francisco-/5707573/">Salesforce Dreamforce festivities in San Francisco</a> (known to locals as “Burning Man for people with jobs”).</p>
      <p>Dreamforce is the woke, save-the-planet stuff of which Obama acolytes swoon – and Obama cynics grimace. The events prides itself in being both beef- and straw-free, with visitors (allotted compostable utensils, naturally) frolicking in a vast artificial forest (far better than the jungle outside that is decaying San Francisco). The former leader of the Free World is part of <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/speakers/">a speakers’ program</a> that includes Apple CEO Tim Cook, Arianna Huffington, Deepak Chopra, soccer great Megan Rapinoe and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/entertainment/emilia-clarke-nude-game-of-thrones/index.html">a <i>Game of Thrones</i> actress</a>.</p>
      <p>That brand of “beautiful people” one-world, one-love co-existence wasn’t on display on the Atlanta debate.</p>
      <p>But also in short supply was proof that the candidates had taken to heart a warning issued earlier this week by Obama, presumably in the directions of Warren and Sanders: “Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality.”</p>
      <p>Obama added, “The average American doesn’t think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.”</p>
      <p>It’s the 2020 field’s disinterest in mimicking Obama’s message and style that puzzles. In the final half-hour of the debate, Harris correctly alluded to how Obama masterfully assembled a winning coalition – in part, by drawing on his background as a community organizer. However, Harris’ background is the flip-side of the coin, a former prosecutor having to justify <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-kamala-d-harris-defends-record-as-prosecutor-but-skips-some-details/2019/06/08/22cf194c-89ed-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html">her past enforcements of state and city laws</a>. That’s not <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-the-obama-hope-poster_b_133874">“hope.”</a></p>
      <p>The other 2020 Democrats seem have forgotten that Obama’s optimism what was stood out in 2008. Yes, he was gifted the political tailwind of an unpopular president, a bad economy and unpopular wars. But Obama was so astute as to recognize that voters wanted a candidate in whom to believe, not to share grievances.</p>
      <p>Maybe that’s not possible in this day and age – not when the foil is Donald Trump. Nor does it help when the debate moderators set the tone for the evening by chumming the waters with impeachment talk, the day’s big news in Washington.</p>
      <p>The bottom line: I’ll wager nothing much changes – no meteoric rise or fall – as a result of this debate.</p>
      <p>But at what point does Barack Obama enter the Democratic contest – spiritually and intellectually, albeit <i>in absentia</i>?</p>
