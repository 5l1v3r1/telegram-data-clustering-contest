      <p>Mauricio Pochettino said "you will always be in our hearts" as the former Tottenham manager left an emotional goodbye message to the Spurs squad.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was sacked and replaced by Jose Mourinho on Wednesday, despite leading Tottenham to a shock Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>Tottenham pulled the pin on Pochettino's five-and-a-half-year tenure with the club languishing 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's assistant Jesus Perez used Twitter to share the Argentinean's heartfelt goodbye on a tactics board, having been unable to say goodbye personally.</p>
      <p>"Big thanks to you all," Pochettino wrote in a picture posted on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"We can't say goodbyeâ€¦ you will always be in our hearts."</p>
      <p>Pochettino's future has dominated headlines since his Tottenham departure.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old has been linked to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich as well as Manchester United, who reportedly keen on Pochettino before turning to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain have also been touted as potential destinations for Pochettino.</p>
