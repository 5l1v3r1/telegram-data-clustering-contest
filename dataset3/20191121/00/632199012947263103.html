      <p>Volkswagen has revealed a new electric concept car at the LA Motor Show this week, the ID Space Vizzion.</p>
      <p>It is a five-door estate car that showcases the upcoming ID5 estate, which is due to launch in 2021.</p>
      <p>The ID Space Vizzion has a range of 367 miles (WLTP) and has a similar platform size to an Audi A6 Avant.</p>
      <p>Its driveline is compacted into the floor, enabling for more passenger and luggage space.</p>
      <p>Up to 586-litres of boot space is available.</p>

      <p>Power comes from an 82kWh battery pack integrated in the floor. It can charge to 80% within 30 minutes on a 150kW rapid charger.</p>
      <p>The interior reflects a new direction for the brand with a simplistic layout and minimal switchgear.</p>
      <p>A large 15.6-inch infotainment screen dominates the centre console, while a smaller instrument display provides crucial information to the driver.</p>
      <p>There is also an augmented reality head-up display that provides all relevant driving information.</p>

      <p>VW says the platform can support both rear- and all-wheel-drive.</p>
      <p>The electric motor generates 275PS, while the four-wheel-drive version uses two motors to deliver 335PS.</p>
      <p>The ID Space Vizzion is the seventh concept car of the ID family and forms part of the VW Groupâ€™s desire to produce one million EVs per year by the end of 2022.</p>
