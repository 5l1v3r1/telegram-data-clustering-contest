      <p>The news has been awash with how second-hand or hearsay statements are supposedly inherently unreliable and cannot be used as evidence to prove a case. But the Supreme Court and courts around the country have made clear that certain hearsay evidence can be used as evidence in court.The issue of hearsay evidence is all over the news as the presidential impeachment hearings continue. Indeed, lawmakers, the President, and media pundits point to the hearing’s use of hearsay/second-hand evidence as showing that the process is fatally flawed. For example, allies of President Trump have said:  </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Democrats’ star witness: ALL HEARSAY,” a Republican National Convention video claimed; and</li>
        <li>“The [witnesses’] understanding, which is the foundation of the case for the Democrats, was based on secondhand information,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters</li>
      </ul>

      <p>To be clear, the Federal Rules of Evidence, including the rules regarding hearsay evidence, do not apply in the ongoing impeachment hearings. But hearsay issues routinely arise when litigating employment law claims and the impeachment hearings serve as an important reminder about how hearsay evidence can (and cannot) be effectively used.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Hearsay defined</h3>
      <p>In broad terms, hearsay is generally understood to mean “an out of court statement offered for the truth of the matter.” Federal Rules of Evidence 801 and 802 specifically define hearsay and provide that this type of evidence is generally not admissible <b><u>unless</u></b> an exception exists. And this rule is consistent with the understanding that a witness relaying another person’s statement or actions can be less reliable than a first-hand account. </p>
      <p>Notably, however, the exemptions and exceptions to the rule against hearsay are as important as the rule itself.  And the Federal Rules of Evidence explicitly dictate that hearsay/second-hand evidence may be admissible, depending on its use, purpose, and the circumstances under which the testifying witness became aware of its existence. Federal Rule of Evidence 803 alone lists <i>23 exceptions</i> to the rule against hearsay and even more exceptions exist under Rules 804-807.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Hearsay evidence can be used in court under the following scenarios</h3>
      <p>The reality is that few cases involve “smoking-gun evidence,” and the law recognizes that most claims will be proven through circumstantial evidence, or evidence that requires drawing an inference to reach a conclusion. This includes hearsay evidence. In deciding whether a particular piece of evidence, including hearsay, should be admissible, a court looks at a variety of factors; most importantly, whether the evidence is sufficiently reliable.</p>

      <p>With these principles in mind, the Federal Rules of Evidence provide nearly 30 different ways in which hearsay evidence can be used in court to prove your claim.</p>
      <p>Exemptions to the hearsay rule, meaning this evidence is not even defined as hearsay, under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d) are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prior statements of a testifying witness that are used to prove that the current testimony is consistent or inconsistent; and</li>
        <li>A statement made by an opposing party in a representative capacity that is then offered against that party. This is referred to as a statement by a party-opponent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Exceptions to the hearsay rule, meaning the evidence is hearsay but it is nonetheless admissible, are laid out in Federal Rules of Evidence 803-807 and include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When the declarant is unavailable to testify (deceased or otherwise incapacitated), a statement made under belief of imminent death is called a dying declaration – the idea is that people speak the truth when they think they are going to die (Rule 804(b(2));</li>
        <li>A present sense impression, where the statement describes an event or situation and was made simultaneous to the event or immediately after – in theory, people are more accurate when they describe things as they happen (Rule 803(1));</li>
        <li>A statement of the declarant’s then-existing state of mind (that describes motive or intent) or physical or emotional condition – a person’s intention in the moment that intention existed is strong evidence (Rule 803(3)); and</li>
        <li>The residual exception (Rule 807), which allows hearsay evidence if it is supported by sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness and is more probative on this issue for which it is offered than other evidence that could be obtained through reasonable efforts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Parting thoughts on hearsay evidence</h3>
      <p>In trials and other legal proceedings, the court admits evidence that helps prove the case one way or another, but not it if it is unfair or prejudicial to either side. Admission of evidence is a balancing act, and legal minds (not to mention politicians and pundits) may disagree on what is admissible. The goal is to look at the totality of the circumstances and get to the truth, one way or another.</p>
