      <h1>Otago third in economic growth</h1>

      <p>Otago continues to flex its muscles as a regional economic powerhouse.</p>
      <p>Growth over the past quarter has come on the back of construction and primary export strength.</p>
      <p>Latest regional numbers position Otago as third in growth for the past quarter, at 2.8%, narrowly pipped by Hawke's Bay at 2.9% and Tasman which expanded 3.2%.</p>
      <p>Infometrics senior economist Brad Olsen says key drivers of growth include construction, with consent numbers up around 11% and 35% across residential and non-residential respectively.</p>
      <p>''Construction activity continues to grow at pace as New Zealand attempts to make up shortfalls in housing, services and infrastructure from rapid population growth over previous years.''</p>
      <p>In the Otago context, population growth remained a key driver of growth, he said.</p>
      <p>''When you take into account population growth, reflected in health enrolment figures in Otago where were up 4.6% for the period, that is one clear indicator that demand will be increasing.''</p>
      <p>He said consumer credit card spending was also up 4% in Otago, ahead of the 3.4% New Zealand average.</p>
      <p>''So Otago is showing growth and we are still willing to spend money,'' he said.</p>
      <p>Supporting growth are also the growth in primary product pricing, particularly across dairy and meat sectors.''</p>
      <p>Mr Olsen said on a broader level, latest dairy pricing estimates would put an additional $1.3billion in dairy farmers' pockets around the country next year. About $75million of that was headed to Otago and another $170million to Southland farmers.</p>
      <p>There were warning signs emerging over the longer term, however.</p>
      <p>''Traffic flows have slowed further, spending growth has moderated and tourism activity continues to weaken.</p>
      <p>''There's also a growing divide between current activity and the future outlook, with global and domestic uncertainty at odds with current growth,'' he said.</p>
      <p>Otago Chamber of Commerce chief executive Dougal McGowan said the numbers were positive, although it would be interesting to compare the numbers and data across the region.</p>
