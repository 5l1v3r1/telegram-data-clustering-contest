      <p>American art collector and philanthropist <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Helen%20Stern">Helen Stern</a>, who helped establish the contemporary art scene in Washington, DC, and buoyed that city’s school of postwar Color Field painters, has died at eighty-nine years old. The cause was pneumonia, according to her son and the <i>Washington Post</i>.</p>
      <p>In 1962, Stern cofounded the Washington Gallery of Modern Art, near Dupont Circle, which opened with a major retrospective of Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline and exhibited the work of <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Sam%20Gilliam">Sam Gilliam</a>, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Arshile%20Gorky">Arshile Gorky</a>, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Jasper%20Johns">Jasper Johns</a>, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Robert%20Rauschenberg">Robert Rauschenberg</a>, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Frank%20Stella">Frank Stella</a>, and <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Anne%20Truitt">Anne Truitt</a> over the course of its six-year run. As a member and chairman of the board, Stern championed the artists of the Washington Color School, including <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Kenneth%20Noland">Kenneth Noland</a> and <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Morris%20Louis">Morris Louis</a>, and facilitated the hiring of eminent curator <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Walter%20Hopps">Walter Hopps</a> as the museum’s final director. In 1968, facing financial troubles, the gallery merged with the Corcoran Gallery of Art.</p>
      <p>Stern met her second husband, Philip M. Stern—a journalist, political adviser, and Sears heir—in 1957, prompting her move to Washington. During their marriage (they divorced in 1972), the couple amassed a significant art collection that includes work by <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Josef%20Albers">Josef Albers</a>, <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=Marsden%20Hartley">Marsden Hartley</a>, and <a href="https://www.artforum.com/search?search=David%20Smith">David Smith</a>. Stern, who was also a practicing pianist and painter before turning to sculpture, sold most of the collection in 1978, and beginning in the mid-’70s, lived part-time in Cuernavaca, Mexico, working as an art teacher and benefactor at a local orphanage, before returning to the capitol in the early 1990s.</p>
