      <h1>Lonzo Ball To Return From Adductor Strain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.slamonline.com/author/austinkent/" target="_blank">Austin Kent</a></address>
      <p>The New Orleans Pelicans will welcome Lonzo Ball back to the court for the first time in six games, <a href="https://twitter.com/WillGuillory/status/1197696555488178176?s=20">Will Guillory of The Athletic</a> reports. The third-year guard has been sidelined with an adductor strain but will see a limited workload tonight.</p>
      <p>The groin injury derailed what was shaping up to be a solid start to the 2019-20 campaign for Ball. In fact, the 22-year-old had averaged 11.5 points and 6.1 assists per game, the latter of which would qualify as a career high.</p>
      <p>Ball, like many of the new faces on the Pelicans, is still in the midst of adapting to a new franchise and style of play, so stepping back on the court will be a welcomed change.</p>
      <p>The Pelicans recently welcomed Brandon Ingram back to action as well. Ingram missed several games with <a href="https://www.slamonline.com/nba/knee-soreness-continues-to-plague-brandon-ingram/">knee soreness</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/pelicans/news/pelicans-shootaround-update-presented-hub-international-lonzo-ball-questionable-phoenix">Jim Eichenhofer of the Pelicans’ team site</a> wrote earlier today that the return of Ball will free up veteran Jrue Holiday to play off the ball more, a style that he’s thrived in over the past few seasons.</p>
