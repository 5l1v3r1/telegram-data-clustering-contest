      <h1>An app that animates illustrations and other cool tech-led design interventions are the highlight of the Bengaluru By Design Festival</h1>

      <p>If you were one of those students flummoxed by the basic concepts of physics such as the Archimedes Principle, then Vivid Books may have just been ‘the’ Eureka moment for you. It is not another textbook but an app which makes concepts come alive through Augmented Reality (AR). Point an iPhone or an iPad, (right now it’s not available for Android devices) to a paper with a textbook-like illustrations of two empty beakers and watch them fill up with water according to Archimedes Principle. The app’s 28-year-old inventor, Vitek Skop, says that almost everyone who has watched illustrations come to life, from a red bus showing Newton’s Law of Motion to a coal engine chugging on the tracks, with sound by the way, have come back to him saying ‘If only this was there when I was in school’. <br/><br/>At the BIC (Bangalore International Centre) for the Bengaluru by Design festival (BBD), Skop looks more like a college student, working on his laptop outdoors with headphones on his ears. It has been six months of excitement since the free app was launched, from a debut at the London Design Festival to the BBD here and an upcoming festival at Los Angeles. It was the final year project of his graphic design Masters degree, not so liked by his professors “who would have liked a poster better” but appreciated by the head of the university. “I did the app more for applying AR in a useful field such as education than to please my teachers,” he said of the one-year effort by him and a team of four including a “cool coder”. The technology allows a user to print out the illustrations of concepts on any paper and then use the paper to note down what they have learned. “Usually designers use AR for entertainment but this, I feel, is more relevant.” <br/><br/><br/>The second edition of the ongoing BBD festival has got multiple public installations, exhibitions, talks, workshops and interactive experiences across ten venues of the city. It was conceptualised last year by Suprita Moorthy and Mithika Gaekwad, and the latter noted, “The second edition of Bengaluru By Design showcases an interaction between various fields and propagates education and community building. Each idea we generate has the power to transform our lives and create new experiences.” <br/><br/>One such immersive experience that’s colouring the imagination of visitors to BIC is UK artist Liz West’s Our Colour Reflection set up in the large foyer. Consisting of 756 acrylic discs in 15 colours, the installation catches sunlight to throw it around in a colourful reflection. If the science of all this is bothering you, probably Skop and his app have the answer for you. <br/><br/><br/><i>Attend Bengaluru By Design till November 24, for more details, look up bengalurubydesign.com<br/><br/><b>To feature an event on this page, send the details and photographs to mybangaloremirror@timesgroup.com with the subject line ‘Unwind’</b></i></p>
