      <h3>Poof</h3>
      <p>A prototype of SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket partially burst apart during a ground test on Wednesday at the company’s test site in Boca Chica, Texas, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974884/spacex-starship-rocket-prototype-failure-test-texas"><i>The Verge</i> reports</a>. A <a href="https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight/status/1197265917589303296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197265917589303296&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2019%2F11%2F20%2F20974884%2Fspacex-starship-rocket-prototype-failure-test-texas">livestream</a> of the incident shows the massive stainless steel cylinder burst into a thick white cloud, showing large creases and dents at the top afterwards.</p>
      <p>SpaceX is playing down the failure.</p>
      <p>“The purpose of today’s test was to pressurize systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected,” a spokesperson for SpaceX told <i>The Verge</i>. “There were no injuries, nor is this a serious setback.”</p>
      <h3>Thanks Mark</h3>
      <p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1197271943180771329">said on Twitter</a> that the company will move on to a newer “MK3” version with a modified design.</p>
      <p>“This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>The very same 165-foot test vehicle that burst yesterday, dubbed MK1, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/spacex-final-starship-prototype-design">stood behind Musk</a> as he gave the press an update on the company’s planned rocket back in September.</p>
      <p>“This thing is going to take off, fly to 65,000 feet — about 20 kilometers — and come back and land in about one to two months,” Musk said at the event.</p>
      <h3>Ambitious Timelines</h3>
      <p>It’s not the first time we’ve seen SpaceX test vehicles explode during testing. A SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft, meant to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/cause-spacex-explosion-april">exploded</a> during an emergency systems test in April.</p>
      <p>If all goes well — and Musk is known for his extremely ambitious timelines — SpaceX will launch the gigantic rocket within “in less than six months,” according to Musk.</p>
