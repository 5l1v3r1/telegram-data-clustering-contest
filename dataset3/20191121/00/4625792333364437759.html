      <h1>Giuliani says he spoke with Ukrainians about Biden ‘today'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:59:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:59</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>President Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani admitted he’s still speaking to Ukrainians about the investigations he pursued on behalf of Trump that are at the center of the impeachment effort.</p>
      <p>Giuliani’s admission came the same day U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified to the House Intelligence Committee that Trump and Giuliani sought a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Sondland said an Oval Office visit was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/sondland-trump-only-wanted-ukraine-to-announce-investigation-into-biden-not-a-real-inquiry">leveraged for an announcement</a> of an investigation into Trump’s political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Glenn Beck, Giuliani complained that Ukrainians, who could allegedly support his case about “bribery” by Biden and “collusion” between Ukrainians and Democrats in 2016, were not being granted visas to testify.</p>
      <p>“All I can tell you is that for three or four years, that embassy has deliberately interfered with the ability to develop this story by not giving visas to [former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Viktor] Shokin and now four or five other parliamentarians, who are ready, willing and able to testify to this."</p>
      <p>“They have direct evidence about the bribery, the collusion. The case is a massive pay-for-play, multi-million-dollar scheme,” Giuliani said.</p>
      <p>“I was in contact with two of them today,” he added.</p>

      <p>Federal prosecutors in New York <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/giuliani-being-investigated-for-possible-campaign-finance-and-lobbying-violations">are investigating</a> whether Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent and if he stood to profit from a <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/federal-prosecutors-investigating-giuliani-for-ties-to-ukrainian-energy-projects">proposed pipeline project in Ukraine</a>.</p>
      <p>Two Giuliani associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested in October on charges of illegal campaign contributions. Both men allegedly lobbied Ukrainian government officials to back the proposed pipeline, while also helping in Giuliani’s efforts to pressure Ukraine to launch an investigation into the Bidens.</p>
