      <p>While Icebergs swimming pool and the elegant <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/restaurants/icebergs">dining room and bar</a> are super famous, its <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/bondi/bars/terrace-cafe">terrace</a> is almost unknown. That may change this summer, with the launch of the Ketel One Botanical bar.</p>
      <p>The intimate outdoor space is at the south end of the Icebergs complex, discretely tucked off Notts Avenue, which leads you to the Bondi to Bronte walk. You enter the space through a timber-lined tunnel, and as you step onto the deck, it’s sea breeze and views of Bondi and the ocean for days.</p>
      <p>The deck used to be lined with astroturf but now it’s decked out in blond timber – from the floors and the walls to the tabletops (Sydney landscape architects Secret Gardens are behind the design). There’s native Australian flora dotted around the space, umbrellas shading punters from the sun and well-dressed waiters taking table orders of cocktails and snacks.</p>
      <p>The dishes are made in the fine diner’s kitchen and include a beef burger (grilled beef, cheese, tomato, lettuce, sauce), fish burger (crumbled hoki with cheese, tartare and lettuce), caprese salad, fries, shucked oysters and Ortiz anchovies served with toast and finger lime. There’s a small selection of vino – one prosecco, a white, a rosé and a red – as well as a Byron Bay Brewery lager.</p>
      <p>As the name suggests, there’s also a lot of Ketel One vodka mixes. You can pick from two cocktails or mix and match the Ketel One Botanical range (cucumber and mint, grapefruit and rose, peach and orange blossom) with sodas made at the Icebergs bar.</p>
      <p>Inspired by nature, they include fig leaf and mango; sea rosemary, coconut and jasmine; and macadamia, lemon myrtle and sandalwood. The new Ketal One vodka range feeds into the trend we’re seeing of lower alcohol by volume (it’s 30 per cent). These also have no artificial flavours and are only 50 calories per serve.</p>
      <p>
        <i>The Icebergs Terrace x Ketel One Botanical is open daily from 12.30 to 8pm till the end of March, and 12.30 to 6pm every Saturday and Sunday from April 2020 onwards.</i>
