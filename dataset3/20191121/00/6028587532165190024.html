      <p>Apple has responded to damning allegations against the originator of its flagship original film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banker_(upcoming_film)"><i>The Banker</i></a> by pulling it from this week’s <a href="https://fest.afi.com/">AFI Fest</a> in Hollywood. The film–starring Samuel L. Jackson and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1107001/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1">Anthony Mackie</a>–depicts the true-life story of how an enterprising African-American, Bernard Garrett Sr. (played by Mackie), became owner of a regional bank in the ‘50s-era American South amid fervent racial opposition.</p>
      <p><i>The Banker</i> had been set to premiere at AFI Fest on Thursday night, but those plans were scrapped by Apple on Wednesday after allegations of sexual abuse and historical distortion surfaced against the subject’s son, Bernard Garrett Jr., who guided his father’s story to the big screen.</p>
      <p>“We purchased <i>The Banker</i> earlier this year as we were moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy,” Apple said in a statement. “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps. In light of this, we are no longer premiering <i>The Banker</i> at AFI Fest.”</p>
      <p>In response to a Nov. 6 story about the film on <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/video/the-banker-10-year-development-hell-1202187645/"><i>IndieWire</i></a>, Garrett Jr. was accused of prolonged sexual molestation and biographical misrepresentation in the script by–according to <i>Variety</i>–his half-sister Cynthia Garrett in the article’s comments section.</p>
      <p>Cynthia Garrett’s allegations of spurious storytelling against her half-brother were affirmed by another poster named Grace Garrett, a presumed relative, who wrote: “This story is not being told accurately and Bernard Jr. is [lying]. Please speak with the other [eight] children of Bernard Garrett Sr.”</p>
      <p>Neither Cynthia nor Grace Garrett has publicly expanded on their charges since the original postings. In her post, Cynthia Garrett says Garrett Jr. “[molested] me and my baby sister for years” and that “Every producer and star who played a part [in the film] should be ashamed. Apple TV should be ashamed.”</p>
      <p>Apple did not address the specific claims against Garrett Jr. or the film on Wednesday. Nor did they divulge whether they will rollback <i>The Banker</i>’s Dec. 6 limited release date or it’s debut on the Apple TV Plus app in January. Apple acquired distribution rights to the film in July.</p>
      <p><i>The Banker</i> also stars Nia Long, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Harney">Michael Harney</a> (<i>Orange is the New Black</i>) and Forbes 30 Under 30 alumnus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Hoult">Nicholas Hoult</a> (<i>The Favourite</i>).</p>
      <p>Directed by <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1079776/#director">George Nolfi</a>,<i> </i>the two-hour feature was originally scheduled to occupy Thursday’s Closing Night slot at AFI Fest but was replaced Wednesday by the Netflix feature<i> Marriage Story</i> from writer-director Noah Baumbach.</p>
