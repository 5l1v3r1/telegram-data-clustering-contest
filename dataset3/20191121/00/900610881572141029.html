      <h1>Indian visitors to the GCC to increase 81 per cent by 2024</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Akanksha Maker</a></address>
      <p>The number of Indian tourists travelling to the GCC is expected to increase to 81 per cent from 5.4 million in 2018 to 9.8 million in 2024, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10 per cent, according to the latest data published ahead of Arabian Travel Market (ATM) 2020.</p>
      <p>As destinations throughout the middle east prepare to showcase their latest offering at ATM 2020, which is being held at Dubai World Trade Centre from April 22, 2020, Colliers International predicts that more than 20 per cent of India’s total outbound market will travel to the GCC by 2024 – with business, place of work and leisure underpinning this demand.</p>
      <p>Danielle Curtis, exhibition director middle east, Arabian Travel Market says, “This influx of Indian visitors to the GCC shows no sign of abating, with every reason to believe India will maintain its position as a top source market as the region prepares to welcome an estimated increase of 81 per cent by 2024, providing a significant boost to the region’s tourism industry as we look ahead. This projected growth is being supported by a number of key stakeholders in the region, from immigration initiatives and mega events, to hotels, F&amp;B venues, resorts, theme parks and malls – all of which appeal to Indian travellers.”</p>
      <p>Adding to this, India retained its top spot on Dubai’s list of source markets for inbound tourism, with almost one million Indian tourists arriving in the emirate during the first half of 2019.</p>
      <p>Indian tourists are among the world’s highest spenders while travelling abroad, with outbound travel and tourism expenditure to increase from US$21.4 billion in 2018 to US$39.3 billion by 2024.</p>
