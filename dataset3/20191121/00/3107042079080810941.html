      <p>Police are appealing for dash cam footage taken at the time Christchurch cyclist Fyfa Dawson was killed after being hit by a truck.</p>
      <p>Miss Dawson, 19, died after a concrete truck hit her about 8am on October 30 in a 30km/h area as it made a turn on Springs Rd near Halswell Junction Rd. She was working at Benny's Barber Shop in Sydenham.</p>
      <p>Police want to hear from anyone with dash cam footage who may have been travelling north at or about this time. Major road works were being undertaken around the Halswell motorway overbridge.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Brian Cameron said it is important those motorists get in touch whether or not they witnessed the incident involving a concrete truck and a cyclist.</p>
      <p>“Footage of the traffic flow in that area at that time would be helpful to the investigation team as they continue their work to establish the cause of the tragic incident.</p>
      <p>"It may demonstrate the traffic ebb and flow at the time - even if the footage doesn’t show anything directly related to the crash, please allow police the opportunity to determine its evidential value.”</p>
