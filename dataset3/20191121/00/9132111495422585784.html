      <p>Nature and Development Foundation (NDF), a non-governmental organisation, has revealed that 2.5 million m³ of timber, which is equivalent to a forest area of 8,300 football fields, is illegally harvested annually in Ghana.</p>
      <p>Addressing the media on the study published on Wednesday, the Capacity Building Expert, Abena Wood, said illegal logging is a major cause of Ghana’s deforestation.</p>
      <p>“Between 2000 and 2010, increase in forest cover through forest plantations is 150,000 hectares, which accounts for only 13% of forest cover loss (1,150,000 hectares),” she stated.</p>
      <p>Adding that, "right now we are cutting more than we are growing at a rate of three times more."</p>
      <p>Tropenbos Ghana is an NGO implementing a European Union (EU) project of “strengthening the capacities of non-state actors to improve Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade, Voluntary Partnership Agreement (FLEGT-VPA) and Reducing Emission from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in West Africa.</p>
      <p>Delivering the report, Ms Wood indicated that the 2012 forest and wildlife policy intended to ban illegal timber on the domestic market has not been achieved.</p>
      <p>According to her, there is a high demand for wood by consumers but low supply deficit leading to high logging but little or no reforestation.</p>
