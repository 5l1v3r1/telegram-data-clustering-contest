      <p>Jon Moxley picked up another AEW victory after defeating Darby Allin with an insane top-rope double-arm DDT (Paradigm Shift) as Moxley prepares for what appears to be an inevitable rematch against Kenny Omega down the line. Chris Jericho was tricked into challenging Scorpio Sky for the AEW Heavyweight Championship in a match that will take place next week in Chicago.</p>
      <p>Last week’s episode of AEW Dynamite drew drew 957,000 amid the fallout for Full Gear, although Full Gear’s <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/aew-full-gear-estimated-ppv-buys-662219/">underwhelming pay-per-view buyrate</a> suggests AEW Dynamite has not yet established itself as a driving force for pay-per-view buys.</p>

        <b>AEW Dynamite Results: Wednesday, November 20, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Fenix def. Nick Jackson</b>
      </p>
      <p>Matt Jackson (34 years) isn’t that young of a buck and if the time comes where his body can’t keep up with their high-octane offense, Nick Jackson will be just fine as a singles performer.</p>
      <p>The Young Bucks are overqualified jobbers until further notice.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hikaru Shida def. Britt Baker</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s great to see a Shida pick up a well-deserved win, but I hope this isn’t another example of AEW outsmarting themselves because they think their fanbase has already figured out whom they are intent on pushing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MJF, Hangman Adam Page Advance in Diamond Dozen Battle Royale</b>
      </p>
      <p>Billy Gunn doesn’t get enough credit for having the best wrestling gear of all time.</p>
      <p>Every MJF elimination is strategically designed to get heat.</p>
      <p>There might be no superior live event experience than Orange Cassidy’s offense.</p>
      <p>The closer Hangman Adam Page gets to the main event, and another match against Chris Jericho, the more nervous I get.</p>
      <p>I hope MJF wins the Diamond Dozen diamond ring next week, and I hope it’s obnoxiously large and MJF uses it as a weapon.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Chris Jericho Makes Major Announcement</b>
      </p>
      <p>The average age of SCU is 42, but that did not stop them from dressing like teenagers.</p>
      <p>I pray there is a vignette next week for Scorpio Sky’s first date with his childhood crush Melanie Parsons.</p>
      <p>I was infuriated at the backwards booking when the heel Chris Jericho made the challenge to Scorpio Sky until I realized it was a ll a setup by the witty babyfaces in SCU. A very well-done setup.</p>
      <p>Scorpio Sky saying he has waited 15 years for a world title shot points out the institutionalized racism in pro wrestling, but saying he waited just one year to get an AEW world title shot makes AEW look progressive as hell.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Luchasaurus def. Peter Avalon</b>
      </p>
      <p>A match between Luchasaurus and Jake Hager needs to be built up over the course of several months and it very well may be one of the bigger showdowns in wrestling.</p>
      <p>Poor Peter Avalon appears to have hit his ceiling in AEW and boy is it low.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Private Party def. Proud and Powerful</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/new-york-city-indie-wrestler-matt-travis-passes-away-661988/">Rest in Power Matt Travis</a>.</p>
      <p>This match juxtaposed the best (Proud and Powerful) and worst (Private Party) theme music in AEW.</p>
      <p>During the commercial break of this match, there was a wild brawl between the Raw, SmackDown and NXT women and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t flip the channel to watch it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jon Moxley def. Darby Allin</b>
      </p>
      <p>Darby Allin’s body bag entrance could prove to be chilling one day if he keeps wrestling these insane hardcore matches.</p>
      <p>Darby Allin’s appeals to the highly specific, yet underrepresented, teenage goth pro wrestling demographic.</p>
      <p>Jon Moxley enters through the crowd because "he doesn't want to turn his back to anybody." But by entering through the crowd, he's turning his back to thousands of people on the way to the ring. I think Mox needs to rethink this.</p>
      <p>This match barely came out of the commercial break and referee Rick Knox already had latex gloves on to handle the blood.</p>
      <p>Darby Allin came to the ring in a Jon Moxley bodybag, as an intimidation tactic, but he looked like a real fool when Moxley put him back in it during this match.</p>
      <p>Moxley’s top-rope Paradigm Shift was one of the most ill-advised bumps I’ve ever seen. But Darby Allin is quickly becoming the king of ill-advised bumps. Wow.</p>
