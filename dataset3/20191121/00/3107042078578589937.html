      <p>It's set to be a very hot, dry end to November with some areas due for no rain at all before December 1.</p>
      <p>Some regions will see highs 10C above average, particularly inland and eastern areas, forecaster Weatherwatch says.</p>
      <p>Tonight and tomorrow morning could still be a little cool before the temperature soars, with this weekend and next week likely to see highs in the late 20Cs or possibly 30C in some regions.</p>

      <p>The entire North Island will be dry for the next seven days as will much of the South Island, Weatherwatch said, thanks to a high pressure system.</p>
      <p>Southland, Otago and Taranaki could see a shower or two while the West Coast would have some rainy days.</p>
      <p>Head forecaster Philip Duncan said there were parts of the country that would receive 0mm for the remainder of the month.</p>
      <p>"Places like Nelson, Marlborough and Northland may receive no rain at all, not even a shower, for the rest of the month. Other regions like Waikato, Auckland, and Wairarapa may get 0.2 to 1mm".</p>
      <p>Remote inland areas in both islands would be verging on heatwave criteria, with at least four days coming where the temperature was 5C+ above normal, the forecaster said. Five days in a row is the technical definition of a heatwave.</p>
      <p>It's a far cry from the thunderstorms, lightning and hail that smashed parts of the South Island yesterday.</p>
      <p>Golfball-sized hail chunks reportedly broke windows and damaged roofs around midday on Wednesday, while on Monday a tornado ripped through Christchurch CBD, injuring two people.</p>
