      <p>COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) - Strong defense and 21 points from Mark Smith gave Missouri the edge over <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a> 70-52 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Missouri (4-1) jumped out to a 14-4 lead and kept <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a> scoreless for a five-minute stretch. The Tigers then went cold from the 3-point range, making just 2 of 14 shots beyond the arc in the first half.</p>
      <p>“They got our attention and made it a ball game,” Missouri coach <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cuonzo-martin/">Cuonzo Martin</a> said.</p>
      <p>Missouri forward Reed Nikko - who had scored just four points through the team’s first four games - made a layup and free throw, and Kobe Brown added four key points to help the Tigers finish the half on a 9-0 run to lead 36-29.</p>
      <p>Missouri kept its lead in the second half but let <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a> (4-1) stay within comeback distance most of the game. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a> forced 17 turnovers, five committed by Missouri forward Jeremiah Tilmon.</p>

      <p>“I don’t want to take anything from Morehead,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cuonzo-martin/">Martin</a> said. “I thought we did a poor job of really just taking care of the ball. I thought we were careless.”</p>
      <p>After being outrebounded 31-23 in Monday’s win against Wofford, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cuonzo-martin/">Martin</a> said rebounds were “one of our keys to the game.” The Tigers grabbed 45 rebounds compared to 28 from the Eagles.</p>
      <p>“Coach put it on the board that we need to come out here and redeem ourselves,” Mark Smith said. “I thought I saw everyone going and crashing the boards, hitting bodies and boxing out.”</p>
      <p>Mark Smith made 3 of 5 3-pointers. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cuonzo-martin/">Martin</a> said he thought Mark Smith drove with more power against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a> than he had against Xavier earlier this season.</p>

        <p>Dru Smith added 11 points, nine rebounds and five assists for the Tigers.</p>
        <p>Jordan Walker scored 14 to lead the Eagles.</p>
        <p>Missouri saw good production from the bench. Forward Parker Braun snagged four rebounds, and forward Tray Jackson scored seven points.</p>
        <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a>: The Eagles outscored their opponents by double digits in three of their first four games but suffered their first loss on Wednesday. This week’s tough two-game road stretch should prepare them for the Ohio Valley Conference schedule.</p>
        <p>Missouri: After a dominant showing against Wofford on Monday, the Tigers struggled in the first half against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a>. But the team showed it can still rely on its stingy defense to win games.</p>
        <p>TILMON STRUGGLES</p>
        <p>After scoring 16 against Wofford on Monday, Missouri forward Jeremiah Tilmon had just five points and accounted for five of the team’s 17 turnovers against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/morehead-state/">Morehead State</a>. “He sees teams that double him differently every game,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cuonzo-martin/">Martin</a> said. “I think he’s doing a better job of recognizing how the double is coming at him.”</p>
