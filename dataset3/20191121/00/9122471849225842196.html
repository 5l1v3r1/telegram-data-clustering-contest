      <h1>Video: Ben Simmons Makes His First NBA 3-Pointer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:32:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>It appears all those videos of Ben Simmons shooting from long range in the offseason weren’t that deceiving. On Wednesday night, the All-Star forward made the first three-point shot of his career.</p>
      <p>There aren’t too many flaws in Simmons’ game. He’s an exceptional passer, solid defender and more than capable of scoring inside the paint.</p>
      <p>Perimeter shooting has been the biggest weakness for Simmons since he entered the NBA. Somehow, the former No. 1 overall pick went 171 regular season games without connecting from beyond the arc.</p>
      <p>Simmons finally snapped that drought as he hit a three-point field goal tonight against the New York Knicks.</p>
      <p>The crowd at the Wells Fargo Center went into a frenzy after the ball went through the bottom of the net.</p>

      <p>Most of Simmons’ teammates were celebrating near the bench when he made the shot.</p>
      <p>All jokes aside, the Philadelphia 76ers could take a massive leap forward this season if Simmons can occasionally make jumpers. The team doesn’t need him to become an elite shooter, but he needs to make defenders at least respect his outside shooting.</p>
      <p>Simmons might have to make a few more three-pointers this season if he wants people to believe that he’s actually expanded his offensive skillset.</p>
