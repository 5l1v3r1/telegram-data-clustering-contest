      <p>Juventus have now made two great incorporations to their squad. In fact, despite the approaching winter transfer window, the club, owned by Andre Agnelli<b>, </b>has been<b> concentrating on keeping some of their players at the club.</b></p>
      <p>And, after Bonucci, one of those was Cuadrado, as was already known. The last <b>negotiations had progressed very well, </b>so it was hoped that the official announcement would arrive soon, as happened this Thursday. </p>
      <p>The Colombian arrived at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> <b>as a striker four years ago</b> and now, at the hands of Sarri, has established himself as one of the key men at the Italian club. For this reason, his new contract with the improved conditions is already a reality. </p>
