      <p>Manheim Inspection Services has added 55 new Skoda Superbs to its fleet, extending its existing relationship with the Czech brand.</p>
      <p>The specialist in vehicle auctions, inspections services, refurbishment and logistics said it chose the Superb for its impressive spec and competitive wholelife costs.</p>
      <p>Alan Barratt, group supply chain director at Cox Automotive, ordered the cars on behalf of Manheim Inspection Services. He said: “The Superb is utilised by our team of vehicle inspectors, and their continued positive feedback on the car made the choice easy when it came to renew the fleet. The Superb is refined, reliable and packed full of tech – it suits our business well.</p>
      <p>“Our existing Skoda Fleet had covered some 2.3 Million miles without a single mechanical failure - the ‘Superb’ truly lives up to its name.”</p>
      <p>The new arrivals are specified in SE Technology trim, which includes an Amundsen sat-nav system with an eight-inch touchscreen and integrated Wi-Fi, tinted glass, 17-inch alloy wheels, a three-spoke, multi-function steering wheel, and SmartLink+ technology that allows drivers to integrate their smartphones.</p>
      <blockquote>The Skoda Superb was facelifted in July. <a href="https://www.fleetnews.co.uk/cars/reviews/skoda-superb-facelift-first-drive">Read our review of the new car here</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>Andrew Bannister, area fleet manager at ŠKODA added: “The Superb is a standout choice for the fleet sector. With its generous kit, spacious interior, sharp design and low whole life costs it continues to impress.”</p>
