        <b>National assignment has robbed Real Oviedo of the chance to field in-form striker Samuel Obeng in the Asturian derby against UD Las Palmas.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Real Oviedo will play as guests against fellow strugglers Las Palmas in the Spanish Segunda Division B at the Estadio Gran Canaria on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Blues will be aiming to end their poor run of results in the game after picking two draws and two wins in their last four matches.</p>
      <p>They will however have to do it without the attacking potent of Ghanaian striker Samuel Obeng who has been a revelation in the ongoing campaign after netting 3 goals in 5 games.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old is currently on a national duty with Ghana's U-23 side at the ongoing Africa Youth Championship in Egypt.</p>
      <p>He will not return to the side's camp until at least the end of next week as the Black Meteors have one last game left to play against South Africa.</p>
      <p>The Meteors fell against Ivory Coast in the semifinal stage of the competition following a shootout defeat but can still book a ticket to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo should they overcome South Africa in the third-place playoff on Friday, November 22, 2019.</p>
      <p>Obeng has been one of the key players for the West Africa giants in the tournament, providing two assists and scoring one in four matches.</p>
