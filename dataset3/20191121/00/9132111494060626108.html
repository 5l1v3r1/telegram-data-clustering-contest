      <p>The Paramount Chief of Sefwi Anhwiaso in the Western Region, Ogyeahoho Yaw Gyebi II has hit hard at the President of the National House of Chiefs, Togbe Afede XIV, and his Vice-President, Daasebre Nana Kwebu Ewusi VII following an earlier statement issued by the House in which it rejected the proposal to make local elections partisan and urged Ghanaians to vote against it at the 17 December 2019 referendum.</p>
      <p>“We are not running executive presidency at the National setting. We are all Omanhenes but we have chosen some of you to represent us”, the Chairman of the Governance Committee of the House, fumed in an interview monitored by MyNewsGh.com on Fox FM in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>According to him, any suggestions that the proposed referendum to allow partisan politics in local elections was not discussed by the House is not only dishonest but wanton mischief.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know who and who came out with this statement on behalf of all the paramount chiefs in the country, especially when two major political parties have taken a different stance”, Ogyeahoho Yaw Gyebi II wondered adding ‘I am for correction’</p>
      <p>Last week Thursday, Togbe Afede and his vice jointly signed a statement indicating that the house was against the proposed referendum to allow partisan politics in local elections and, therefore, called on Ghanaians to vote ‘No’ at the polls.</p>
      <p>The statement elicited reactions from Ogyeahoho Gyebi and the Okyenhene, who expressed indignation about its contents.</p>
      <p>The Okyenhene, in a statement, said the contents of the statement signed by Togbe Afede and his vice did not reflect the views of the traditional leadership of the country.</p>
      <p>Ogyeahoho Gyebi, who spoke to the media, said the decision was not the collective view of the house because it did not go through due process.</p>
      <p>But Togbe Afede, in a counter-statement issued, maintained what was contained in the earlier statement, saying: “Any suggestions that the proposed referendum to allow partisan politics in our local elections was not discussed by the house are not only dishonest but also wanton mischief.”</p>
