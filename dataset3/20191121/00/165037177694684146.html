        <b>"I'm not one more, I'm the special one". The phrase is unmistakeable. It was said 15 years ago, on the 2nd July 2004, when Jose Mourinho came to Stamford Bridge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Seriously, I don't want to be taken <b>arrogantly,"</b> said the man who returns to England<b> for the fourth time. </b>It is <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham Hotspur</a> who welcome<b> one of football's strongest personalities</b>, the man who upset both his own fans and others and that, to many people's disappointment, has tamed with the passing of time.</p>
      <p>Because<b> Mou is not what he used to be,</b> atleast in terms of the media. His 'showtime' in press conferences stayed in Madrid and his fiery character has been extinguished. There are no longer the<b> "why,"</b> references to Unicef and lists of errors.</p>
      <p>Maybe that's why he has got another chance in England. <b>He has been sacked from his last three teams,</b> Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United, with the last dismissal being the worst.</p>
      <p>But Mourinho already warned years ago, when he his case was compared to that of Manuel Pellegrini's. "What happened to him won't happen to me. When I get out of here, <b>I'll go to a great team in England or Italy."</b></p>

      </ul>
      <p>And time has proved him right. The latest big team to knock on his door is Tottenham, a team very much with <b>his winning style from earlier years.</b> A big club, but not winner, atleast not yet. </p>
      <p>As was Porto or Inter before his arrival,<b> clubs he transformed with titles previously unimaginable.</b></p>
      <p>But his Champions League counter<b> has been standing at two ever since.</b> Since 2010, the top continental competition has been elusive to him and<b> now he has arrived at a club</b> that has recently reached the final.</p>
      <p>The new stage in London will test <b>his ability to retrain</b>. Manchester United's Mourinho is no longer good, no matter how low the bar is set at White Hart Lane for titles.</p>
      <p>He has to overcome the great work of Mauricio Pochettino in the last five years and <b>will have to do it against the clock</b>, because in London they are tired of waiting. </p>
