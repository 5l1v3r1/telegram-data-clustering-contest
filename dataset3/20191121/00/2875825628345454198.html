      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/hilary-duff">Hilary Duff</a> has shared an epic behind-the-scenes photo from the highly-anticipated Disney+ reboot of Lizzie McGuire.</p>
      <p>The Lizzie McGuire actress, 32, sent social media fans into meltdown on Wednesday as she posted a sneak peek inside the incredible Lizzie-Gordo reunion.</p>
      <p>In the snap, Hilary reveals the reprise of Adam Lamberg as Lizzie's best friend, David 'Gordo' Gordon as the two pose side-by-side together.</p>
      <p>Adam, who played Lizzie McGuire's best friend through two seasons of the show and its 2003 movie, will join Hilary in the sequel.</p>
      <p>Even Duff’s <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> caption was Lizzie McGuire-inspired.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "I feel so basic saying something that’s been shouted at me almost my whole life buuuut……hey now, hey now."</p>
      <p>Lizzie kept true to her character's former teen fashion but with a mature edge as she donned her trademarked fringed hairstyle, tie-dyed t-shirt and a silver chain belt (a popular accessory from the 2001 show).</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two recently spoke about the importance of Gordo's return to the show in a statement.</p>

      <p>She said: "Gordo was an essential piece of the puzzle to what made the original Lizzie McGuire so authentic and beloved.</p>
      <p>"I couldn’t imagine the series without him. I can’t wait for fans to see what he’s up to 15 years later and how he fits into Lizzie’s adult world."</p>
      <p>News of Lamberg's return comes after it was confirmed that Hallie Todd, Robert Carradine, and Jake Thomas will reprise their roles as mom Jo, dad Sam, and brother Matt for the show.</p>

      <p>The actress is set to return as the much-loved Disney character, now a 30-year-old woman navigating life as a millennial in New York City.</p>
      <p>Picking up more than a decade after the series left off, Duff is an interior designer with her dream apartment and a handsome boyfriend.</p>
      <p>However, as she turns 30, Lizzie finds her life being turned upside down as she is forced to turn to her family to find herself once again. And now, based on this first look photo, it seems like Gordo will also be playing a part in Lizzie's adult adventures.</p>

      <p>The hit series is being revived for the new streaming platform Disney+, which is set to challenge rivals such as <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> and BritBox.</p>
      <p>Disney first announced that Duff would return for the reboot as the main character during the D23 Expo convention in August.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two will once again team up with the original series creator Terri Minsky to work on the show.</p>
      <p>This is just the first project under a new overall deal Minsky has signed with the Disney Channel.</p>

      <p>The reimagined version of the 2001 series will stay true to the original by featuring an animated version of Lizzie, who'll offer up funny and revealing commentary to tell viewers what the character is really thinking.</p>
      <p>The original series followed 13-year-old Lizzie as she tried to fit in at school, get along with her best friends Miranda (Lalaine) and Gordo (Adam), and talk to cute boys.</p>
      <p>It aired for four seasons on Disney Channel, between 2001 and 2004, and became the broadcaster's highest-rated show.</p>
      <p>It also saw the release of The Lizzie McGuire Movie in 2003. The film grossed a massive $55 million.</p>
