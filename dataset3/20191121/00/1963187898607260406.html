      <p>CAIRO – 21 November 2019: Former Arsenal captain, Martin Keown, believes that the North London club should consider approach to sign the ex-Tottenham Argentinean manager Mauricio Pochettino. <br/><br/>“Pochettino is now available. My message to the Arsenal board is: sign him!.” Keown said on Thursday. <br/><br/>Tottenham Hotspur announced on Wednesday that the club appointed veteran manager, Jose Mourinho, as the new club manager to replace the sacked Argentinean who managed the team during the last five and half years, taking them to the last season’s UEFA Champions League Final. <br/><br/>Keown added “I just think that the Unai Emery experiment is, at the moment, failing. I think the fans have lost confidence in him. He seems to be out of his depth.” <br/><br/>Arsenal are struggling at the league this season and they sixth at the league table with 17 points and they seem to have no chance to challenge the league leaders, Liverpool, for the title as the Reds have gained 34 points. <br/><br/>Arsenal fans expected Mourinho to be their new manager but the Portuguese manager made a surprise move to the Gunners’ arch rivals, Tottenham.</p>
