      <p>We marketers have access to more data than ever before. Thatâ€™s swellâ€¦ if you can derive value from it. Nancyâ€™s keynote, <b>Make Data Stick through Duarte DataStoryâ„¢</b>, delivers a framework for making sense of limitless data, and actionable tactics for using data to tell compelling, humanizing stories to your teams, stakeholders, and customers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Challenge #2: Digital Noise</b>
      </p>

      <p>Delivering consistently terrific customer experiences across digital channels is the Holy Grail of martech. But all those touchpoints create a ton of clutter. Brianâ€™s keynote, <b>The Distracted Customer: How to Connect the Dots Between Martech, Marketing Operations, and Customer Distractions to Deliver Clarity and Value</b>, provides the insights that will help your organization break through the noise to serve customers in meaningful and genuinely helpful ways.</p>
