      <p><b>Merrell Men’s Moab Adventure Chelsea Waterproof </b>It seems like everyone is coming out with a variation on the classic Chelsea boot this winter. What grabbed me about the <a href="https://www.merrell.com/US/en/moab-adventure-chelsea-waterproof/41554M.html?dwvar_41554M_color=J61847#cgid=mens-winter-boots&amp;start=1">Merrell Men’s Moab Adventure Chelsea Waterproof </a>is that they are not only stylish and cool-looking but were built to defy the winter elements. Your run-of-the-mill Chelsea boots would be quickly compromised by the rain, sleet and slush that your travels may take you to this winter. These boots are like all-terrain vehicles, with full grain waterproof leather uppers and Merrell’s M Select™ DRY that seals out water and lets moisture escape so you stay dry. They’ve also got M Select™ WARM lightweight, which is low bulk 100 gram insulation to keeps you comfortable. Fleece lined, they has a Vibram® outsole for traction. Like virtually all Merrells, they’re instantly comfortable. $130.</p>

        <b>Lowa Dublin III</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bavarian boots made by Lowa are the king of the mountain when it comes to hiking boots. But their new <a href="https://www.lowaboots.com/mens/cold-weather-boots/dublin-iii-gtx-qc-anthracite">Lowa Dublin III GTX QC</a> model is designed for winter wear in the streets of Berlin, Boston or Bratislava. These Chukka boots have a soft, suede-like finish. But don’t let the good looks deceive you. These guys are also made with Gore-Tex, so the slush and the unexpected rain and sleet won’t really affect them or your feet. The rubber traction of the lugged soles, which they call Lowa Sneaker Winter, also means you’ll get a good grip on sidewalks, streets and even on your walk to through a ski village. After all, they sort of scream après ski, and for a night out in St. Anton or Whistler, you want footwear that’s warm and surefooted even if you’re not. These super warm winter sneakers, if you will, fit the bill. $195.</p>

        <b>Olukai Hele Mālie</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a day on the slopes in Montana or cross country skiing through the wilderness of Wyoming, you need to reward your feet with some serious comfort. The <a href="https://olukai.com/collections/men/products/hele-malie-mens-leather-slippers?variant=29596018212963">OulKai Hele Mālie</a> slippers are the luxury ride you’re seeking. Note that these are not your old man’s slippers. They’re made with a suede leather upper that’s soft and welcoming and once your feet hit the shearling liner, the deal is sealed. Those liners, you’ll be happy to know, are removable and washable.  The Hele Mālie have also got a really good grip, thanks to what OluKai calls a ‘Wet Grip Rubber’ outsole traction. They say that the sole was inspired by Hawai‘iloa wood carving. Cool enough, but likely the last thing on your mind when you take the pooch for a quick outdoor trip at 11pm and know you won’t go flying on the icy sidewalk. “Hele mālie,” by the way, is Hawaiian for “take it easy.” So the name fits as well as the slipper. $130.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It may be winter but not every day is a snow day. There are days when you just don’t need or want to wear a pair of boots, like the day you fly from Chicago or Portland or Denver to Costa Rica or Isla Holbox or Cartagena this winter. For shoes that can make the transition from one climate to the next, consider a pair of <a href="https://www.arborcollective.com/products/foundation-lx-brown-leather-gum">Arbor Foundation LX</a>. They’re a pair of hip sneakers that can get you through O’Hare and onto a tropical beach a few hours away. The company is known for their snowboarding and skateboarding wear, but these very affordable shoes are ideal for hopping on and off planes and onto steamy tarmacs. I love the stylish leather and canvas uppers and the low profile. $89.</p>

        <b>Stegmann EcoWool Clog</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are two types of men in the world: those who love clogs and those do not. For the former, the good news is that Stegmann, the Austrian company that has been crafting wool clogs since 1888, have introduced the <a href="https://www.stegmannusa.com/collections/ecowool">EcoWool Clog</a>. These clogs have been felted from wool that is sourced exclusively from small, cruelty-free European partner farms in Austria and Scotland that are committed to native sheep preservation. Like other Stegmann clogs, they are hand-made and hand-felted. The wool naturally reflects the colors of the sheep, rare breeds that are in need of protection, in this case Tyrolean Stone Sheep from Austria and Shetland Sheep from the Shetland Islands in Scotland. Stegmann claims that their entire process is green, using a chemical-free and zero-waste process, with wastewater from the felting process safely reintegrated into the ecosystem. They also account for 100% of the carbon dioxide generated in the production and transportation process through green energy investments. At the end of the day, you have a classic pair of clogs that are ideal for après ski, hike or exploration. For clog lovers, they’re a wooly bit of heaven. $140.</p>

        <b>Mammut Ducan Pro High Gore-Tex</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you spend a lot of time in Switzerland each year, as I do, it’s hard to ignore the Mammut brand, which dominates the outdoor sporting goods scene. Hiking, mountaineering and skiing shoes and clothing are what the company focuses on and does very well. It’s little wonder that their new hiking shoes, the <a href="https://www.mammut.com/us/en/p/3030-03890-4601/ducan-pro-high-gtx-men/">Mammut Ducan Pro High Gore Tex</a>, are ideal for a winter walk in the Alps, where winter walking and hiking are a reasonable way to deal with often severe conditions. They will work well in the Alps but also closer to home in Vermont or Colorado or wherever you want to put them through their paces. These boots are literally made for winter, with a Gore-Tex lining and in their MAMMUT Flextron technology, which incorporates a spring-steel sole as a midsole in the shoe. This prevents deflection of the foot and provides vertical support for hikes and climbs. There’s also a Vibram® sole designed specifically for winter conditions. If you’re serious about the outdoors in winter mode, check them out. $229.</p>

        <b>Adidas Terrex Free Hiker</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you’re like me, then you probably pigeon hole Adidas as a maker of good running shoes. So that’s why the <a href="https://www.adidasoutdoor.com/terrex-free-hiker-men%27s-hiking-boot/CEU65.html">Adidas Terrex Free Hikers</a> took me by surprise. These may not be designed for ascending the Matterhorn but they are a clever marriage of a trail running shoe and a hiking boot. They remind me more of a well-made high top, albeit one that you could take out on a decent trail in many parts of the world this winter. The outsole has something they call Continental grip which does indeed grip whatever surface you’re on. The Adidas folks call it a hiking shoe with trail running DNA and this lightweight shoe seems to fit that description. $200.</p>

      </p>
      <p>You can spend a small fortune on a pair of Chelsea boots or you can score a pair of <a href="https://www.rockport.com/rockport/mens-colden-chelsea-boot-/ml03080.html">Rockport Colden Chelsea’s</a> and not break the bank and have money left over for more travel gear. These suede boots, in dark brown, tan or black, are dressy enough for business wear but also double for a casual night out, whether you’re in the West End or the American West. The have the look and thick elastic band of the classic Beatle boots of the 1960’s but also classic Rockport touches, like a truTECH outsole, for hitting the pavement. $110.</p>
