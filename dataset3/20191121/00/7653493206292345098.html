      <h1>Samsung Frame Meets It’s Soundbar Match</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>The Samsung Frame TV high-resolution art display has met its match in the Next Level Acoustics high-performance soundbar that fits the elegant aesthetics of the popular home entertainment device.</p>
      <p>The New England-based designer of custom speakers and enclosures has unveiled its Fusion Frame soundbar built to complement the super-shallow Frame TV in its four different variations for an opening cost of US$1400.</p>
      <p>Next Level Acoustics is currently exploring distribution in Australia for the Fusion Frame Soundbar, with opportunities now currently open to carry the device.</p>
      <p>To match the four sizes of Samsung Frame TVs, there are six Fusion Frame models available, with four being stereo soundbars and two LCR models for the larger 55-inch and 65-inch models.</p>

      <p>At a depth of only 1.75 inches, the super-slim soundbar is built to provide exceptional sound quality and room-filling dynamics, with the look and feel of the Samsung Frame TV.</p>
      <p>Available in either black or white, the Fusion Frame Soundbar may even find its way into other Hi-Fi setups beyond The Frame.</p>
      <p>Though for those after something a little more generic, you could always go for the Fusion Flat, a slightly thicker model but one less geared towards the Samsung Frame aesthetic.</p>
      <p>With Next Level Acoustics proprietary 4.5-inch aluminium convex cone driver, coupled with the rare earth neodymium motor system, the Fusion Frame promotes high acceleration and excursion to achieve ultra-low audio distortion during use.</p>
      <p>Supporting the soundbar is an optional in-wall subwoofer the CI-IW10S, a compact unit with a long-throw 10-inch cast frame driver that’s designed to fit in 2×4 construction.</p>
      <p>Providing extended bass response all the way down to 34 Hz, while using only 40 watts of power.</p>
