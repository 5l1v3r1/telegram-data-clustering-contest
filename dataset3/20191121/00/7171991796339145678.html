      <h1>Creating Lookalike Valves With Resin Casting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hackaday.com/author/lewinday/" target="_blank">Lewin Day</a></address>
      <p>Valves (tubes) certainly have a die hard fan base in the electronic community, praised for their warm sound, desirable distortion characteristics and attractive aesthetic. However, sometimes you just want the look of a valve for a prop or a toy, without actually needing the functionality. For those cases, <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Resin-Cast-LED-Vacuum-Valve/">this project from [Ajaxjones] might be just the ticket.</a></p>
      <p>The build consists of taking an existing valve, combining it with a 3D printed base, and using this to create a silicone mould. 3D printed parts and dressmaker’s pins are then used to create the internal parts of the valve, and are inserted into the mould. Clear resin is then degassed, and poured into the mould to create the part. Once cured, the part is removed and the base painted to complete the look. An LED is then installed into a void in the base to give the piece a warm glow as you’d expect.</p>
      <p>It’s a simple tutorial to producing high-quality clear plastic parts, and one that should prove useful to many prop builders and cosplayers alike. If you’re wanting to take your resin game to the next level, <a href="https://hackaday.com/2019/07/19/making-flexible-overmolded-parts-with-urethane-resin/">consider trying some overmolded parts.</a> Video after the break.</p>
