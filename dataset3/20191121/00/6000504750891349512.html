        <b>Santander has put its technological weight behind a left field project: a device that enables blind people to experience football matches through their fingertips.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spanish banking giant has teamed up with advertising giant Havas Group on Fieeld, a touch system for broadcasting pre-recorded sports events that enables the movements of the ball and the plays to be followed using the fingertips.</p>

      <p>The device converts the data collected by monitoring the players and reproducing each move. The technology then transfers the position of the ball to the user's hands. <br/><br/>Santander has lined up several events - featuring Brazilian legend Ronaldo - in Brazil, Argentina and Peru to show off the technology as Flamengo and River Plate contest the Libertadores Cup final this weekend.<br/><br/>Juan Manuel Cendoya, senior EVP, communications, corporate marketing and research, Santander, says: â€œFieeld is a clear example of how technological progress and football can have a positive impact on society and improve the quality of life, this is why we have developed this project."</p>
