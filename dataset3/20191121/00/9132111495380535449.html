      <p>A group calling itself Caucus of the New Patriotic Party Health Workers of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital says it is unhappy with the withdrawal of the appointment of acting Director-General of the Ghana Health Service, Dr Baffour Awuah.</p>
      <p>The group in an earlier release alleged that some faceless individuals were working against Dr Awuah’s appointment.</p>
      <p>Emmanuel Kusi Sarpong, Convener for the NPP caucus, said they need an explanation from the presidency.</p>
      <p>“When we are working, we are working for the good of all Ghanaians, not NPP alone or NDC alone or whichever party one belongs to. The nature of our work is such that we give healthcare to the needy and everybody in Ghana."</p>
      <p>"So, if you don’t know him, being or taking a front row in a political party, it doesn’t mean that you can go ahead to smear him with a certain picture that cannot be proven.”</p>
      <p>“And I believe before the President gave him the opportunity to serve, due diligence was followed and I believe governance is a serious business and our President cannot give an appointment to someone without first doing background checks. I don’t know why we are seeing a withdrawal but maybe if it is made known to us, we may calm down”.</p>
      <p>The government today, November 20 2019, withdrew the appointment of Dr Baffour Awuah as the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS).</p>
      <p>Citi News sources at the Presidency confirmed the withdrawal of the two-week appointment.</p>
      <p>No explanation has so far been given for the government’s decision.</p>
      <p>Dr Baffour Awuah was appointed in a letter signed by the Executive Secretary to the President, Nana Bedietuo Asante on November 5, 2019.</p>
      <p>He was given the new role following the reassignment of the former GHS boss, Dr Anthony Nsiah-Asare to the Presidency as an advisor on health-related issues.</p>
      <p>Before the appointment, Dr Awuah was the Medical Director of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital.</p>
