        <b>Chris Berrow &amp; Leigh Milner review Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Leigh - I was actually pleasantly surprised. I thought this wasn't going to be great. <br/><br/>Chris - I liked archery a lot. You know I was rubbish but you taught me the trick. You wait till the wind dies down. I originally thought this is going to be the sort of game where you try out all the sports once and then none of them are in-depth enough to bother to carry on. So like the badminton was one of the exceptions or actually I could see myself getting into that you'd like the badminton. But actually you're totally right. It's more like a sort of you play if there's two three or four people playing you wouldn't really play on your own.</p>
      <p>Leigh - It's definitely a good one for when friends are over families round. </p>
