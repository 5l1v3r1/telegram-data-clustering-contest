      <p>Practically every article in recent years about the 90-year-old Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama focuses on one thing: experiencing her work in the age of Instagram. The matter tends to be raised not as a criticism – either of the work (of course not) or of those who appear to see her work for the sole purpose of Instagramming it – but as a point of discussion. The questions these articles raise are valid, and worth thinking about: Just what are the conditions of seeing in this hyper-mediated era? Does experiencing participatory work through your cameraphone diminish the “experience” itself, or does it merely alter it into something entirely new and quintessentially <i>now</i>? What might Kusama, who’s been obsessing over the exact same themes of infinity, self-obliteration, madness and playful sensuality for nearly 70 years, think of people not losing themselves in the work at all, but rather indulging their impulses to broadcast – in real time – to everyone they know that they’re at a Yayoi Kusama exhibition?</p>
      <p>At the same time, there’s something to be said for not worrying about it and just letting whatever happens happen. If people want to line up for two hours for one minute in a Kusama Infinity Room, who’s to say how they should spend that precious minute once inside? The simple fact that people <i>are </i>lining up for two hours suggests that a lot of people deem it worth their while. Not many other contemporary artists can boast the same popularity, or the same buzz.</p>
      <p>Nor can many contemporary artists elicit such joy and excitement among such a diverse group of people. On a recent trip to see Kusama’s month-long show at the David Zwirner Gallery in New York, “Every Day I Pray for Love,” I saw a line that extended down the block and, presumably, around the corner. Inside the gallery was yet another, though much shorter, line to get inside the one Infinity Room included in the exhibition, “Dancing Lights That Flew Up to the Universe.”</p>

      <p>The excitement of the crowd both inside and outside the gallery was palpable, but not in the same way as at other popular art exhibitions. The mood was light and the conversations giddy, more like you’d expect from a crowd outside a new doughnut shop on opening day than one waiting to get inside a contemporary art gallery on a frigid, late-fall afternoon. In addition to the Infinity Room, dozens of new paintings, “soft” sculptures” and an installation of metallic droplets (or clouds, depending on your perspective) fill out the massive space. If most people come for one minute in the Infinity Room, I hope they’ll stay for the more static works on display, and with no one timing them, linger over their precision and whimsy.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidalm/2016/08/22/at-87-yayoi-kusama-continues-to-create-spaces-of-wonder-retrospective-to-tour-us-in-2017/#5de4812c38e6">last time</a> I’d seen a Yayoi Kusama exhibition was in 2016, at a retrospective of her work dating to the 1950s titled “In Infinity” at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Maybe it was the gloomy weather that day, but whatever “crowd” there was at the museum was comparatively subdued, and there were no lines to get into any of the exhibition’s Infinity Rooms. The following year, Kusama’s work had its first North American tour in 20 years, and suddenly social media was flooded with selfies taken inside Kusama’s many-mirrored chambers. Now, not quite three years later, when you mention Yayoi Kusama in a roomful of people, just about everyone perks up.</p>
      <p>I see that as a net positive, regardless of how familiar the artist’s newer fans may be with her work, let alone her staunchly conservative upbringing, her time in a psychiatric hospital, her attempts to bridge her inner life with the outer world through what would become a lifelong obsession with polka dots, or her contributions to the sexual revolution by staging all-nude “happenings” in New York in the 1960s. If people are still going to see Kusama’s work, and standing in line for it, then she’s proven to be far more adaptable to the changing times than many of her much-younger peers.</p>
      <p>That she doesn’t pander to the Instagram generation only reinforces her integrity as an artist: Yayoi Kusama simply does what she does, and if it happens to play well on our cellphones and catch people’s eyes as they scroll through their feeds, what more could she ask for? Maybe people are no longer dissolving into the illusory expanses she’s been building for more than half a century, but they seem to be having a great deal of fun regardless.</p>
      <p>Yes, seeing Kusama’s work has become, to a great extent, a mediated experience. At the same time, and by virtue of that fact, it’s become a collective one as well.</p>
