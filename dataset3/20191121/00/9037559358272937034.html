      <p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar on Thursday met the speaker of the provincial assembly, Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, at the CM House to discuss the country's ongoing political situation.</p>
      <p>In the meeting also attended by Elahi's son and a member of the National Assembly (MNA), Moonis, and Federal Housing Minister Tariq Bashir Cheema, the two leaders refuted claims of differences between the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government's coalition parties.</p>
      <p>Elahi said his party, the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid-e-Azam (PML-Q), was in alliance with the PTI and would continue to be so. The coalition was stronger than before and that the wishes of those trying to create cracks in the allyship would remain futile, he said, stressing that he was, is, and would remain in coalition with Buzdar.</p>
      <p>The Punjab CM seconded the PML-Q leader, saying those conspiring to create misunderstandings would never be successful. Both agreed to further stabilise the working relationship.</p>
      <p>Buzdar lauded the senior Elahi for running Punjab Assembly in a satisfactory manner, noting that they had collaboratively worked for the prosperity and progress of the province's people and would continue to do so.</p>
