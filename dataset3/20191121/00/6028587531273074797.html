      <p>For years, we have been hearing about diverse leadership teams driving better financial performance. In an <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter">HBR.org</a> article, it was noted that the performance was better because diverse teams gathered more facts, processed those facts more carefully to guide actions, and were more innovative because of the different perspectives at the table.  More recently, the conversation has turned to recognize that it is not just diversity but also the inclusion of different perspectives that drives the performance improvements. After all, per <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/diversity-and-inclusion-build-high-performance-teams/">Gartner</a>, “Diversity is the first and easier step, but inclusion is the key to leveraging diversity.” If your people can’t actually engage and contribute in ways that make sense to them and that are comfortable for them, then you’re not going to be able to benefit from their diverse strengths and skills.  </p>
      <p>Over the course of my career, I have had the benefit of being in some meetings where leaders were truly inclusive. Instead of letting the same people talk over others and dominate, they intentionally pulled out the voices of the quieter, less-verbal team members to get the best out of everybody.  </p>
      <p>Here are three techniques I have found to be particularly effective and impactful. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Amplification</b>. Have you ever been in a meeting where someone mentioned a great idea, no one really paid attention to it, then someone else presented the same idea as their own, and everyone thought that person was a genius? In amplification, team members repeat the idea of the person who initially presented the idea in order to literally pull out and amplify the idea—not just the volume but to assign proper ownership of the idea, give it credibility, and validate its worthiness of being discussed.

        <li><b>Advanced Written Preparation</b>. When working in Hong Kong, I was faced with issues in staff meetings related to language, hierarchy, and a room full of great employees who were not going to engage in lively verbal debates (although the non-verbal communication was tremendous). Realizing that I needed to take a different approach to meetings than the very Western, “So tell me how xxx is going,” I started handing out index cards before meetings with questions on them. I phrased the questions like, “Write down three things that worked well with this launch” and “Write down three things that we can improve upon for next time.” And then I asked people to hand in their index cards at the beginning of the meeting. When we would reach a topic, I’d read out the feedback written on the index cards but without even knowing who said what. It was a great way to pull out information without requiring people to think and speak on their feet in their second language and in a hierarchical group setting. Since then, I have found this effective across many cultures, especially whenever a topic is sensitive or when the majority of the participants are more introverted in their style or speaking a second language.</li>
        <li><b>Hearing From Everyone Before Starting the Discussion</b>. In Japan, I was in a meeting with participants from Korea, Brasil, London, New York, Saudi Arabia, and… well… me. We were deciding about funding for entrepreneurs and I was concerned about being heard in that group of very smart people. But the leader of the meeting put me at ease when she required that each of us speak for 2 minutes—uninterrupted—at the beginning of the meeting to give our opinions. She encouraged everyone to actively listen as each person had their say, and then we debated more freely. As we debated, she always ensured that all voices were heard which was reinforced by her opening approach which established the credibility and validity and worthiness of all of the voices of the table. The tone she set carried throughout the meeting, and it was one of the most effective tools I’ve seen used—especially with smart senior people.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no one way to run a meeting, but if your goal is to create a more inclusive environment in order to leverage the diversity of your organization in order to drive better results, try out some of these tools and see what works for you and your team!</p>
