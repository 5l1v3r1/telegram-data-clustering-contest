      <p>HOLDREGE, Neb. (AP) - A man is charged with a dozen counts stemming from a deer poaching investigation in south-central Nebraska.</p>
      <p>Station KRVN reports that 28-year-old Arthur Underwood Jr., of Bertrand, is charged with tampering with evidence, false reporting and violating state hunting regulations among other crimes. Phelps County Court records don’t list the name of an attorney who could comment for Underwood.</p>
      <p>His next court hearing is scheduled for Monday.</p>
      <p>Authorities say an investigation shows Underwood killed at least six more deer than he was allowed to kill during the November 2018 firearm season.</p>
      <p>Three other people already have been convicted in connection with the investigation.</p>
