      <p>The epochal yet largely overlooked shift in the Internet’s address book, from v4 of the foundational Internet Protocol to v6, brought with it many badly needed improvements. But it also is spotlighting translation problems between the two systems that need cleaning up before companies can fully take advantage of IPv6’s new opportunities. One of those opportunities has to do with better targeting of programmatically delivered online video ads on set-top boxes. It’s potentially a hugely lucrative and valuable opportunity for publishers and advertisers in the fast-expanding era of premium video, whether with on demand or linear programming.</p>
      <p>In the IPv4 universe, those ads couldn’t always find their audience, like a homing missile with an imprecise targeting sensor. In the IPv6 future, those sensors get a lot smarter, able to tell the difference between the set-top box connected to the living room TV, the smart refrigerator in the kitchen, and the iPad in the den. That improved precision can mean an ad will show up that’s right for the audience watching a specific device, for Mom’s prime-time viewing in the living room rather than Junior’s social-video binge upstairs on an iPad.</p>
      <p>“Really, what we’re doing is serving as a translator of sorts between these two protocols,” said Ben Abbatiello, <a href="https://www.beachfront.com/">Beachfront’s</a> VP of advanced TV. “The process of building a target audience, or segments, or a creative audience, historically, we’ve relied on an IP address for the (entire) home. That process has become increasingly broken with <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html">the proliferation of devices in the home.</a> The number of devices with IP addresses in the home has nearly quadrupled. It becomes a lot more difficult to segment against, target against.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://xite.com/">XITE</a>, a Dutch-born, Brooklyn-based company that serves up music videos on demand, worked with Beachfront to fix a specific problem: better targeting of ads against its content to the huge audience of households on Comcast’s X1 Xfinity set-top box.</p>
      <p>“XITE lives in the X1 set-top box,” said XITE co-CEO Cees Honig. “But some issues (between IPv6 and IPv4) would act as a blocker for X1. The advertising market is not yet ready for IPv6. The market doesn’t believe this is a problem. But we basically couldn’t use this inventory.”</p>
      <p>The X1 is IPv6, powerful technology undergirding the transformation of the nation’s biggest pay-TV provider into its biggest broadband service operator.</p>
      <p>XITE, like Netflix and some other major VOD services, comes preinstalled on the X1, ready to access for music-video fans. And with 25 million Comcast broadband homes, Honig said, “It’s a big part of our inventory.”</p>
      <p>But lots of video advertising is still being sent into the system from companies using the older protocol, which means the targeted ad missiles that IPv6 theoretically enables would misfire into the Internet sea.</p>
      <p>“It requires a lot more granularity,” Abbatiello said. “Any creative stored on a server supporting IPv4 just won’t deliver in the future. It won’t render on a device that supports IPv6. There’s a significant amounts of ad creatives that never get delivered, never tracked for, and these campaigns need a home.”</p>
      <p>Abbatiello called it a “growing problem, increasing by the day” as the Internet of Things and IPv6 platforms such as the X1 transform more households, though the fix the two companies announced today is specific to “environmental factors” in the X1 that needed solving.</p>
      <p>The issue was particularly keen given that the online audience for Comcast is not only huge, but highly valuable to advertisers. Those remaining cord non-cutters likely have more disposable income, and are more likely to watch the ads served up through the system.</p>
      <p>Ad trading desks were pushing for a fix to better access that giant audience, and ensure that marketers could trust that an ad sent to a targeted subset of that audience actually arrives, and is seen. New York-based Beachfront, which bills itself as a “video ad management platform” took on the problem.</p>
      <p>“It’s not really getting the notoriety, the attention that it deserves,” Abbatiello said. “I think we’re all focusing on privacy right now, which is really important, but this is one of those things where we’ll have no connectivity soon enough if we don’t solve for it.”</p>
      <p>Beachfront’s technology fix will have significant application for XITE video and other publishers on some other tech-forward broadband providers, such as Rogers in Canada, and Cox in the United States, Honig said.</p>
      <p>“This will basically individualize each set-top box for itself,” Abbatiello said. “These are the things we’re fighting, a lack of granularity and specificity.”</p>
