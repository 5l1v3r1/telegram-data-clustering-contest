      <p>Luka Doncic recorded a remarkable triple-double as the Dallas Mavericks demolished the Golden State Warriors 142-94 in the NBA.</p>
      <p>Doncic showed no mercy with 35 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in just 25 minutes of action on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The second-year guard had 22 points, five assists and five rebounds after the first quarter alone in Dallas midweek.</p>
      <p>Doncic – who was coming off a 40-point triple-double on Monday – has an NBA-best seven triple-doubles through 14 games for the Mavs (9-5) this season.</p>
      <p>The struggling Warriors (3-13) were led by Eric Paschall's 22 points on the road.</p>
      <p>Kawhi Leonard and Paul George took to the court for the first time together as the Los Angeles Clippers outlasted the Boston Celtics 107-104 in overtime.</p>
      <p>Injuries to both players postponed the star Clippers recruits from playing together, however, that changed on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>George had 25 points and eight assists, while Leonard – back from injury – finished with 17 points in Los Angeles, while Jayson Tatum scored 30 points.</p>
      <p> </p>

        <b>Giannis sparks Bucks</b>
      </p>
      <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo put up 33 points and 11 rebounds in the Milwaukee Bucks' 135-127 victory against the Atlanta Hawks. Eric Bledsoe had 28 of his own as the Bucks won their fifth consecutive game.</p>
      <p>James Harden (27) and Russell Westbrook (25) combined for 52 points, while Clint Capela posted 12 points and 21 rebounds but the Houston Rockets still lost 105-95 to the Denver Nuggets.</p>
      <p>Jarrett Allen's 22 points and 17 rebounds led the Brooklyn Nets past the Charlotte Hornets 101-91.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spurs' slide continues</b>
      </p>
      <p>The San Antonio Spurs are in freefall. Gregg Popovich's team dropped their seventh straight game – a 138-132 loss to the Washington Wizards. It is San Antonio's worst streak since 1996-97.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Simmons shoots a three!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, you read that right. Ben Simmons nailed his first three-pointer in the NBA. After 17 unsuccessful attempts, the Philadelphia 76ers guard ended his drought in the opening quarter of his team's 109-104 win over the New York Knicks.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>The Bucks (11-3) will back up when they welcome Carmelo Anthony and the Portland Trail Blazers (5-10) to Milwaukee on Thursday. Anthony made his debut last time out and will be looking to make more of an impact against the high-flying Bucks.</p>
