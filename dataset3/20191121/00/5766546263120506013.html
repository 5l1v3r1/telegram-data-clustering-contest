      <p><b>Kakata, Margibi –</b> Former Margibi County Senator, Roland C. Kaine, has departed Liberia at the invitation of the Speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament, Honorable Moustapha Cisse Lo, to participate in the 2019 Second Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Parliament convening at its headquarters in Abuja, Federal Republic of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The former Margibi County lawmaker represented Liberia before at the ECOWAS Parliament for more than five years where he ascended to the post of organizing committee’s Rappateur at ECOWAS @ 50 Colloquium.</p>
      <p>“In accordance with Article 27.1 of Supplementary Act A/SA. 1/12/16 relating to the enhancement of the powers of the ECOWAS Parliament, which determines the convening of the Ordinary Sessions, I have the great honor of informing you that the ECOWAS Parliament will hold its 2019 Second Ordinary Session from 20 November to 14 December 2019. In this regard and on behalf of the ECOWAS Parliament, I am particularly pleased to invite you to take part in the said session,” Speaker Lo noted through his invitation to Mr. Kaine.</p>
      <p>Former Senator Kaine told this newspaper before his departure on Tuesday, November 19, at the Roberts International Airport in Lower Margibi County that while in Nigeria, he will deliver a special remark where he intends to admonish members of the ECOWAS Parliament to continue to strive and exert efforts in the enhancement and sustainability of regional and global peace and security, something he said, is cardinal to the acceleration of the developments of the West African region. </p>

      <p>“I want to firstly applaud West African leaders’ recent efforts to have pledged US$1bn to fight armed groups, especially in the Sahel countries. I also think that such efforts should be embraced and supported by members of the ECOWAS Parliament.” Former Senator Kaine asserted.</p>
      <p>The former Margibi County lawmaker praised ECOWAS for its stance against people and organizations that might want to undemocratically ascend to power within the region.</p>
      <p>Continuing, he urged the regional body to remain hardnosed with its stance against undemocratic practice which he believes the past plunged countries of the region in crises. </p>
      <p>He asserted that such position of the Economic Community of West African States has contributed tremendously over the years to the maintenance of peace and security of its members countries.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the former Margibi County Lawmaker who has been absent from the ECOWAS Parliament for nearly nine years now due to his defeat in the 2011 General and Presidential Elections, praised the people of Margibi County for the opportunity afforded him at the time to serve, noting that he remains forever grateful.</p>
