      <p>California Rep. Devin Nunes and his GOP colleagues railed Wednesday against what they believe is the Democrats’ decision to use conspiracy theories to go after President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>“No conspiracy is too outlandish for the Democrats,” Nunes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cC26aYshAyI&amp;feature=youtu.be">said</a> during the impeachment inquiry before listing what he considered conspiracy theories tying Trump to Russia. “Time and time again they floated the possibility of some far-fetched malfeasance by Trump.”</p>
