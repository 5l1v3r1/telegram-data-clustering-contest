      <h1>Tens of thousands of pensioners die waiting for social care between elections, says charity</h1>
      <h2>Age UK has called on parties to set out their plans for tackling the chronic crisis</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Glaze, https://www.facebook.com/MirrorPolitics</a></address>
      <p>Tens of thousands of OAPs have died waiting for social care since the last <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> , campaigners reveal today.</p>
      <p>Some 74,000 people aged 65 and over in England have died or will die waiting for care between the 2017 and 2019 ballots, according to Age UK.</p>
      <p>That equates to 81 people a day or three an hour, the charity said.</p>
      <p>A total of 1.725 million requests for care and support have been or will be made before polling day on December 12 by older people, which have resulted in them not receiving a “care service”.</p>

      <p>That is equivalent to 2,000 fruitless claims from older people a day, or 78 every hour.</p>
      <p>Reasons include OAPs being ineligible; their local authority sending them to another service; and them dying before receiving care.</p>
      <p>Age UK today calls on parties to pump another £8billion into the system over the next two years to try and ease the chronic crisis.</p>
      <p>The demand comes after <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/theresa-may">Theresa May</a>’s 2017 election campaign was derailed by the “dementia tax” row when she unveiled the Conservatives’ plan for funding social care.</p>
      <p>Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: “Unfortunately we have effectively wasted the last 30 months waiting for the Social Care Green Paper that never was.</p>
      <p>“Many older people have lost out as a result, including the 74,000 who had applied or will apply for a care service over this period but who died or will die before a care package was put together and actually provided.</p>

      <p>“No-one knows how many of these older people, if any, might have lived longer had they received care in time.</p>
      <p>“But at the very least their final days would probably have been more comfortable and their families and friends would have felt better supported.</p>
      <p>“The truth is that our political system has completely failed when it comes to the reform and funding of social care and older and disabled people are being badly let down.</p>
      <p>“This general election is the latest in a long list of opportunities to put things right and we fervently hope that this time it’s different.”</p>
