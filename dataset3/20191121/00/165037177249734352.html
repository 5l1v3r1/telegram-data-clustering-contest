        <b>Youssoufa Moukoko, one of the most promising starlets at Borussia Dortmund, received a very special birthday present. The so-called 'African Messi' highlighted one of his favourites. the one from Messi, his idol.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>At just 15 years old </b>he is already wanted by topÂ European clubs. He is called Youssoufa Moukoko and he is lighting up the Borussia Dortmund youth teams.</p>
      <p>The young player has played a total of <b>71 matches (between u15 and u17), scoring 109 goals</b> which gives him a ratio of 1.67 goals per match.</p>
      <p>Moukoko is on course to <b>break records at a young age</b> and in a not so distant future, he could become a really important player as long as he keeps his head screwed on.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Dortmund goalscorer<b> turned 15 </b>and received a lot of birthday presents from friends and family... but there was a special one that <b>excited him a lot</b>.</p>
