      <h1>Braid: Minister says CBE blindsided her on layoffs; might reverse them</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:55:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:55</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>She won’t quite say it — yet — but Education Minister Adriana LaGrange might force the CBE to cancel layoffs of 300 temporary teachers.</p>
      <p>That’s one of the UCP government’s options: a legal directive to the school board, ordering a halt.</p>
      <p>LaGrange acknowledged this Wednesday in an interview, while adding, “I am considering all options.</p>
      <p>“For now, we are ordering an audit of finances and a review of CBE governance.”</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, it’s clear the province won’t accept this status quo.</p>
      <p>The UCP simply does not agree that a $32-million cut to a $1.2 billion CBE budget requires the layoff of so many teachers, or any at all.</p>
      <p>They’re also determined not to take the blame.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the board suddenly announced the most drastic and alarming response possible to the funding cut.</p>

      <p>It will terrify parents and the roaming contract teachers most affected. The layoffs will surely drive up class sizes and add stress to staff in many schools.</p>
      <p>Furious, LaGrange says she was completely blindsided by the CBE.</p>
      <p>“On Monday, we had a meeting in Edmonton with the chairs, superintendents and CFOs of the four metro boards from Calgary and Edmonton,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Not once did anybody from the CBE mention layoffs — not once.”</p>
      <p>Within 24 hours of the meeting, the layoff announcement came.</p>
      <p>Those layoffs had actually been approved at a board meeting the week before.</p>
      <p>Two other big boards, Edmonton Catholic and Edmonton public, are cutting costs but have not announced layoffs.</p>
      <p>Calgary Catholic specifically said Wednesday no teachers will be let go.</p>
      <p>LaGrange also noted that the province offered assistance from provincial officials to deal with the cuts.</p>
      <p>Several boards responded, she said, “but the CBE refused.”</p>
      <p>The UCP concludes that the Calgary board defied LaGrange’s directive “to minimize impact on front-line staff and teachers.”</p>
      <p>It’s hard to disagree when the CBE’s first move <i>only</i> affects the front line.</p>
      <p>CBE superintendent Christopher Usih said when the layoffs were announced that the CBE will make “several other decisions that cover our budget gap.”</p>

      <p>You have to wonder why the board wouldn’t do that first, rather than going after teachers.</p>
      <p>If the CBE officials wanted to make the government as angry as possible, they’ve handled it exactly right.</p>
      <p>There is a history. In 2013, for instance, the board debated a pay freeze for teachers while voting $1 million in bonuses for senior executives.</p>
      <p>“I can’t believe anyone would be that stupid,” then-education minister Jeff Johnson said when he heard the news.</p>
      <p>Johnson, like LaGrange, was appalled. But the Progressive Conservative government of that day was far less dangerous to cross than this one.</p>
      <p>The CBE is no more popular with its own employees than it has been with the public or the provincial government.</p>
      <p>In a survey of more than 9,000 employees, the percentage of positive answers in 10 leadership categories never got above 32 per cent.</p>
      <p>On four questions about trust in superintendents and directors, approval was as low as 24 per cent.</p>
      <p>LaGrange regularly brings up the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/education-minister-dogged-by-past-as-cbe-chairman-in-byelection-campaign">disastrous high-rent deal for the CBE headquarters</a> on 8th Street S.W.</p>
      <p>And she cites an accounting error that made $9.1 million in office spending look like classroom cost.</p>

      <p>The CBE is in a tighter spot than other boards because its reserves are very low.</p>
      <p>The provincial government doesn’t care. LaGrange believes it’s the CBE’s own fault, and there’s plenty of padding to cut a long way from the classroom.</p>
      <p>Layoffs are going on all over the public sector, of course. The UCP sprung them without notice, after saying education spending would not fall.</p>
      <p>Nobody likes this. The government will face anger for months or even years.</p>
      <p>But the UCP has always said the front line should be protected as much as possible.</p>
      <p>The CBE, in its usual inexplicable, stumbling way, appears to openly defy that wish.</p>
      <p>Now, there’s a possibility those teachers will not be laid off. The UCP could see this as a perfect case to make the point.</p>
