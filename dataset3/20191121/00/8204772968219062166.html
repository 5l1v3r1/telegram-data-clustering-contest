      <p>Most 20-year-olds in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> still live with their parents, they are preoccupied with the housing crisis and one in four is showing signs of depression, a new study published on Thursday has found.</p>
      <p>More than two-thirds are registered to vote and over half have engaged in some form of political activism over the past year.</p>
      <p>The latest tranche of findings in the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_event=Growing+Up+in+Ireland">Growing Up in Ireland</a> research also shows the vast majority of those just exiting their teens drink alcohol, about a quarter smoke cannabis and more than a third are overweight or obese.</p>
      <p>Academics and researchers led by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Trinity+College+Dublin">Trinity College Dublin</a> are following the lives of more than 5,000 children from the age of nine to 20 for the long-term national study.</p>
      <p>It notes the 20-year-olds were born in the boom years of the late 1990s, spent much of their childhood and adolescence living in the depths of recession and are transitioning to adulthood during a period of strong economic recovery.</p>
      <p>More than two-thirds of them told researchers they still live at home with their parents and most of them are still depending on them financially, especially for basic living expenses.</p>
      <h3>Worries</h3>
      <p>About 8 per cent said they were having difficulty or great difficulty making ends meet. That figure rose to 14 per cent for the less well-off.</p>
      <p>Asked what worries them, Irish 20-year-olds are most likely to say getting a home, particularly those who come from less advantaged backgrounds. Climate change and poverty are also chief among their concerns.</p>
      <p>About one in four said they suffer relatively high levels of stress and depressive symptoms. Young women are more likely to report suffering than young men – almost a third (32 per cent) of female 20-year-olds showed “clinically significant depressive symptoms”.</p>
      <p>While almost three quarters expressed their hopes for financial security and a good job, comparatively few attached much importance to being in a long-term relationship (29 per cent) or having a baby (14 per cent) over the coming decade.</p>
      <p>The findings show 20-year-olds are generally positive when quizzed about their health but increasing obesity and rising mental health problems are a cause for concern.</p>
      <p>More than a third (36 per cent) overall are overweight, with 16 per cent of women aged 20 classified as obese – almost double the number of men, at 9 per cent. Young women are also less likely to be physically active than young men.</p>
      <p>Almost 16 per cent reported an ongoing “chronic” physical or mental health problem, mainly mental, behavioural or neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
      <p>Some 15 per cent smoked daily, rising to almost one in four (23 per cent) smoking occasionally, while almost all (93 per cent) drink alcohol and nearly a quarter take cannabis “occasionally or more often”, the study found.</p>
      <h3>Depressive symptoms</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Dorothy+Watson">Dorothy Watson</a>, a research professor at the ESRI and one of the report’s authors, said the overall findings “paint a generally positive picture of the lives of 20-year-olds and their engagement with the wider world”.</p>
      <p>“They had a high rate of participation in post-school education or training; they were generally in good health and most used constructive strategies to deal with stress,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The support of parents and friends was important to them.</p>
      <p>“Among the concerning findings were a relatively high rate of depressive symptoms; a higher rate of obesity than when they were aged 17/18 and marked inequalities in educational outcomes by family background.”</p>
      <p>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs Dr <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Katherine+Zappone">Katherine Zappone</a> said she was “delighted that these findings reveal that very many young people are doing well.</p>
      <p>“They also highlight the impact of socio-economic inequalities, and these are issues that warrant our close attention and concerted efforts from a policy perspective,” she added.</p>
