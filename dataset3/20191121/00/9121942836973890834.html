      <p>CAIRO (AP) — The Islamic State group has claimed an attack this week in Egypt’s restive Sinai Peninsula that killed an officer and wounded three others.</p>
      <p>A statement by the extremist group released late on Wednesday on a militant-linked website says its fighters had targeted an armored vehicle carrying Egyptian forces with a roadside bombing the previous day in the town of Sheikh Zuweid.</p>
      <p>Egyptian officials had said a captain was killed and four members of the security forces were wounded in a roadside bombing on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Egypt has been battling an Islamic insurgency in Sinai, led by the regional IS affiliate, that intensified after the military overthrew the country’s Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, in 2013.</p>
      <p>The militants have carried out scores of attacks, mainly targeting security forces and minority Christians.</p>
