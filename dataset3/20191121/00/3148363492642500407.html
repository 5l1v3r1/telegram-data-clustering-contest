      <h1>WATCH: Pete Buttigieg Supporters Cannot Name Any Achievements | Breitbart</h1>
      <h2>EAST POINT, GEORGIA — Supporters of South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg formed the largest contingent of demonstrators outside the fifth Democrat debate Wednesday evening — but had trouble naming any of his achievements.</h2>

      <p>Breitbart News Senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak ventured into the crowd to speak to Buttigieg fans — as well as supporters of businessman Andrew Yang and former Vice President Joe Biden, the other two campaigns represented outside the Tyler Perry Studios.</p>

      <p>“It’s unusual to have a mayor run for president, and you mentioned his experience — what do you think is his biggest achievement in South Bend?” Pollak asked.</p>
      <p>“You got me on that one!” the Buttigieg supporter laughed, holding his “Pete” sign up to block the camera, in jest.</p>
      <p>“Let me think about that one, okay?” he said.</p>
      <p>Other Buttigieg supporters named his military service and his intelligence as reasons to support him. But none could name anything he had actually achieved in public service.</p>
      <p>Asked what his biggest achievement was in South Bend — or even “somewhere else” –one woman answered: “I don’t know about that particularly. I know the thing in his resume, let’s say, that’s most impressive to me is that he is a military vet.”</p>
      <p>Another woman, who had previously cited Buttigieg’s “experience,” struggled to answer the same question.</p>
      <p>“Yes, that’s his first experience, although he’s been mayor, I think, for eight years. He’s had challenges — sometimes when you have a smaller operation, it’s tougher, even, than running a big city. You have fewer resources. He’s had hits and misses, but he’s learned from that and he’s trying to do better.”</p>

      <p>Buttigieg is leading in the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, though he still trails the frontrunners nationwide.</p>
