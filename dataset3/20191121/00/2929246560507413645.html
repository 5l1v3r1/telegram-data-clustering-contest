      <p>Amidst all the talk of the threat that fast bowlers present while operating with the pink ball and the significant presence of dew in the Kolkata winter, Bangladesh spin bowling coach Daniel Vettori has warned against writing off the slower bowlers in the day-night Test between his team and world No.1 India at Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>Spinners have generally had a diminished role to play in the pink ball’s short, 11-match history, having delivered 956.4 overs, as against the 2221.3 overs sent down by the faster men, and picking up 95 wickets, as opposed to the 257 wickets that have fallen to fast bowlers.</p>
      <p>But Vettori saw good reason to make an exception in this instance. "It's slightly different here because of the early sunset,” he said. “A significant part of the match will be played under normal conditions, so spinners won't become redundant in pink ball Test matches. The first two sessions, spinners could really be important.</p>

      <p>"I don't think it is a case of overseas spinners coming here and looking to dominate,” he went on. “Do your role as you would back home. It is more about the economy rate [for spinners], taking 2/60 or 2/70 in the first innings and trying to see what the second innings presents you. That's the right way to go about it.”</p>
      <p>Having said that, Vettori said that Bangladesh’s fast bowlers are excited about playing with the pink ball in the second Test of the series starting on Friday, 22 November. Barring Abu Jayed, Bangladesh’s pacers had a miserable time in Indore, as Ebadot Hossain and Taijul Islam between them went for 235 runs in 59 overs and picked up a solitary wicket. But Vettori said they have come to grips with the SG pink ball and are up for the challenge.</p>

      <p>"The four fast bowlers are excited. That's a nice thing. Bangladesh fast bowlers don't get to be excited too often. I think they are coming to grips with the ball. The SG pink ball is slightly different. Most guys' limited experience has been around the Kookaburra one. But I think there is excitement around it.</p>
      <p>"The relaid wicket here has more bounce. It was watered today and is now covered. We have had only one session when it's dark so they haven't really experienced night time. Tomorrow we will get to experience that. So far so good, as the pink ball behaves so normally at this time of the day.”</p>
