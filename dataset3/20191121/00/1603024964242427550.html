        <b>ICICI Direct's currency report on USDINR</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Spot Currency</b>
      </p>
      <p>The rupee depreciated by 10-paise vs. the US$, spooked by depreciation in the Chinese Yuan as well as domestic growth woes. It is likely to open slightly lower today and would remain under pressure owing to a rebound in oil price and a further weakening CNY • The US$ index ended mildly higher yesterday even as investors continue to gauge US-China on-again, off-again trade talks. Also, the US President, who is likely to sign a bill supporting Hong Kong protestors would further complicate US-China trade relations. CNY is currently trading at 7.04. Any further weakness in the same is likely to put pressure on EM currencies, including rupee.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Benchmark yield</b>
      </p>
      <p>Domestic benchmark 10-year yields ended unchanged at 6.46% in the previous session. Growing worries over domestic growth as well as hardening US yields could contain a sharp appreciation in domestic debt • US 10-year benchmark yields ended further lower at 1.74%. The US President’s fresh threat of higher tariffs on Chinese imports in case of a deal failure worsened risk sentiments.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Currency futures on NSE</b>
      </p>
      <p>The dollar-rupee November contract on the NSE was at 71.86 in the previous session. Open interest declined 1.84% in the previous session • We expect the US$INR to find support at lower levels. Utilise downsides in the pair to initiate long positions.</p>
