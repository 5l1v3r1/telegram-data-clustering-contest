      <h1>Red Hat’s bold plan to change the world of software</h1>

      <p>Red Hat is conducting its global roadshow called Red Hat Forum, which recently came to the Gallagher Convention Centre in Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, Red Hat EMEA sales vice president Michel Isnard outlined the company’s ambitious plan to change the world of software.</p>
      <p>Red Hat is the world’s leading provider of enterprise open-source solutions, including high-performing Linux, cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.</p>
      <p>The company helps customers to integrate new and existing IT applications, develop cloud-native applications, and automate, secure, and manage complex environments.</p>
      <p>Isnard said that Red Hat’s plan to change the world of software relies on people working together according to the values of open-source innovation.</p>
      <p>“We can call it disruption or digital transformation, but the reality is the world we are working in is changing,” Isnard said.</p>
      <p>“We at Red Hat want to change the software industry – we are a software company and we want to change how the world thinks about software. That was the big idea when this company was created nearly 30 years ago.”</p>
      <h3>Bold goals</h3>
      <p>Isnard outlined the company’s four bold goals which guide Red Hat’s strategy in accomplishing this change.</p>
      <p>These goals are summarised below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make Linux the enterprise standard</li>
        <li>Make open hybrid the default architecture</li>
        <li>Extend your data centre to the hybrid edge</li>
        <li>Bring Red Hat and open source to the entire universe</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Isnard said that open-source is now the hotbed of innovation across the enterprise space, and Linux is the cornerstone from which people can build innovative and agile solutions.</p>
      <p>“We need something to allow us to make integration, management, and automation as simple as can be,” Isnard said. “Linux is that common ground.”</p>
      <p>He added that Red Hat aims to make open hybrid the default cloud architecture for businesses around the world.</p>
      <p>“Whether you are doing things within your data centre or the public cloud, we want to help you,” he said. “We believe in this open hybrid approach.”</p>
      <p>The open-source nature of Linux development means that it enables innovation and is the ideal foundation for open hybrid architecture.</p>
      <p>“Linux welcomes innovation every day – it is the DNA of open-source,” Isnard said.</p>
      <p>The evolving nature of cloud-based applications also requires faster data processing as well as low-latency operations, which is one reason why Red Hat aims to bring the data centre to the hybrid edge.</p>
      <p>“In a world which is hybrid, you can get flexibility and elasticity, but the reality is that the cloud also brings complexity – especially when you have to manage private data,” Isnard said.</p>
      <p>Using the example of a self-driving car, he said that in this case, you need to offer processed data and outcomes in a split-second, removing the possibility of sending information back to the data centre for computation.</p>
      <p>Extending the data centre to the hybrid edge allows for applications and solutions which are more reactive and able to to provide information and decisions on-the-fly.</p>
      <h3>Bringing Red Hat to the Universe</h3>
      <p>Isnard said that Red Hat’s last goal towards changing the world of software is to bring open-source technology and the Red Hat philosophy to the Universe.</p>
      <p>“When I say Red Hat, I am talking about us and the extended family,” Isnard said. “We work with our partners, clients, and communities exactly the same way we work internally.”</p>
      <p>“Open source is bigger than Red Hat, and we want to bring it to the entire universe.”</p>
      <p>Isnard said that open-source communities are an indispensable connection for Red Hat, and the company’s own developers are significant contributors to open-source projects around the world.</p>
      <p>He added that all of the latest technological innovations, such as machine learning and IoT, were birthed in an open-source environment.</p>
      <p>This is why Red Hat sees open-source development and solutions as the future of innovation, and why it plans to change the world of software to embrace Linux, open hybrid cloud architecture, and open-source collaboration.</p>
