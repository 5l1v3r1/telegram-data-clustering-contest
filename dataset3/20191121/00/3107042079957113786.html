      <h1>Destination change for Budd</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/scoop%40scene.co.nz" target="_blank">Philip Chandler</a></address>
      <p>Destination Queenstown boss Graham Budd, who’s departing to run Southland’s regional development agency, says he isn’t leaving unfinished business behind.</p>
      <p>The tourism promotion organisation was “humming and in great shape, significantly, with the team, but also with [this year’s extra $900,000] funding in place”.</p>
      <p>He says there are “a lot of great initiatives that the team are now leading to take the organisation forward”.</p>
      <p>The pending visitor levy and reformatting of the DQ-owned Queenstown Winter Festival are “a couple of things that I think are positives for the community”.</p>
      <p>“A few years ago we did a full rebranding of the organisation so, yeah, there’s some achievements that I’m very proud of.”</p>
      <p>But after 12-and-a-half years with DQ, the past seven-and-a-half as CEO, “it is also time to let someone with fresh perspective and a new view of things to come in and take the position”.</p>
      <p>Budd’s resignation announcement, last Friday, came two days after a speech at a Chamber of Commerce function where he urged that balance be brought back to the debate on tourism growth.</p>
      <p>He tells <i>Mountain Scene</i>: “I think the voice of negative people in our community around the value of tourism, and visitors, to our place, has been too strong.</p>
      <p>“It’s a classic example of a vocal minority, and everyone else just getting on with their daily lives and their business.”</p>
      <p>He also reiterates that, for DQ, growth is secondary to maintaining a pipeline of ongoing tourism demand with targeted marketing.</p>
      <p>Budd doesn’t buy concerns Queenstown could become a victim, like Barcelona and Venice, of ‘overtourism’.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s very unfortunate for us to be headlined alongside some of those other destinations.</p>
      <p>“This is not to deny that we have some pressure points at some times of the year, primarily around our transport infrastructure. I think if we sort that out, then we’re in great shape for the future.”</p>
      <p>He’s untroubled that some major tourism markets are slowing down - “it’s just a short-term cycle”.</p>
      <p>However he’s disappointed Queenstown’s still not got a decent-sized conference centre - “that remains an opportunity for our community”.</p>
      <p>Though moving to Invercargill in February to run Great South – a job encompassing economic development, including tourism -Budd says there’ll be linkages to his DQ job with collaborative work underway between regions in the lower South Island.</p>
      <p>And any advice for his successor?</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t presume to offer any advice other than, embrace the place and the people,” he says.</p>
