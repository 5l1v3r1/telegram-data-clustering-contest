      <p>We’re mid basketball and football season, and parents of student athletes from elementary school through college are trying to be good <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">sports</a> parents: encouraging and teaching life lessons without overinvesting.</p>
      <p>Like most potentially fraught human interactions, threading the needle isn’t so easy. Perhaps these thoughts will help.</p>
      <p>First, I’d try to be sure that my child is doing the sport because s/he wants to, not because I want my child to. It’s too big a commitment for the parent to be the driving force. I’d come clean with my child: “I played baseball in college so, of course, I’d enjoy seeing you play, but it’s a major commitment. Is this something you really want to do?”</p>
      <p>As I would when my child came home from school and I’d ask, “So what was new, important, or interesting about school today?” I’d routinely ask the same about the day’s sports practice or game. If my child did something well, say, had a lot of assists in a basketball game, to lock that in, I might ask, “Is there anything you need to remember so you keep that up?” If s/he screwed up, I’d try to show interest without excessive dismay. After all, it is just a game. I’d say, hopefully in a moderate tone, “Well, any lesson to be learned from that, and if not, onward and upward.”</p>
      <p>I’d attend some games but even if I had the time, I’d feel it was overindulging my child and be overemphasizing sports’ importance to attend every game. At games, I’d again aim for moderation: reasonable cheering when my child or the team did something good, quiet when it was something bad. I would certainly try to restrain myself from yelling at the ref, coach, or my child—bad role-modeling. As a human being, I probably couldn’t resist sighing and perhaps rolling my eyes, but I’d try to keep it to that.</p>
      <p>In terms of game results, I’d again aim for moderation. If my kid won, I’d express moderate congratulations. If s/he lost, a moderate, “I’m sorry.” Of course, if it was a big win, say, against the school’s big rival and especially if it won the league championship, I’d be more effusive, a visceral reaction as much as a deliberate one.</p>
      <p>Let’s say my child complained about the coach: too strict, too lenient, or most commonly, that my child wants more playing time. Unless the situation was extreme, I wouldn't contact the coach. I’d ask my child such questions as, “Why do you think the coach is so tough (or so lenient?) Or, “If I asked the coach why you get little playing time, what do you think s/he’d say”? If I felt that a conversation with the coach would be worthwhile, I’d probably have my child do it, perhaps rehearsing it with my kid. I might start that rehearsal by modeling, for example, “Coach, I love being on the team and don’t mind sitting on the bench but it would help me grow if you told me what I need to do to improve enough that I get more playing time.”</p>
      <p>All this talk of restraint shouldn't be interpreted to mean that I hold school-level sports in low regard. On the contrary. Sports offers often indelible lessons in discipline, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/teamwork">teamwork</a>, and sportsmanship—plus it’s inordinately fun. Although I mainly sat on the bench for four years in college and it was only Division III (colleges’ lowest level), playing baseball may be the most unalloyed pleasure I’ve ever had. Being a sports parent of moderation can help ensure that it’s an unalloyed pleasure for your child.</p>
