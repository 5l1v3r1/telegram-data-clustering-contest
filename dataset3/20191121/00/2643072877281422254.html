      <h1>Reps Order FG To Stop Acceptance Fees In Tertiary Institutions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The Federal Ministry of Education and the National Universities Commission has been directed by the House of Representatives to stop undergraduate admission fees charged by Universities.</p>
      <p>The lower chamber ordered its Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to investigate the admission policies and practices, noting that admission seekers go through a tough time while seeking admissions in universities.</p>
      <p>The motion was sponsored by the lawmaker representing Ahiazu/Ezinihitte Federal Constituency of Imo State, Hon. Chinedu Emeka Martins.</p>
      <p>Hon. Martins stated that the acceptance fees being charge by universities put a financial burden on the prospective students and should be stopped.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Having passed through the rigours of Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE), and the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), it was inappropriate to charge admission acceptance fees.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Even the federally operated Universities charges admission fees highly.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“University of Ibadan – N35,000, University of Lagos – N20,000, Ahmadu Bello University – N30,000, Imo State University – N70,000 and Lagos State University – N20,000.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Speaker of the House of Representatives, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/speaker-gbajabiamila-congratulates-bello-lyon-on-election-victory/"><u>Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila</u></a>, who spoke after house members supported the motion, insisted that the Committee should turn in their investigative report in four weeks.</p>
