      <p>The Paramount Chief of the Akyem Abuakwa traditional area has called for a revolutionary decentralisation move.</p>
      <p>The Okyenhene, Osagyefuo Amoatia Ofori Panin II, says to boost development, the government should move a Ministry to all the 16 regions in the country.</p>
      <p>“What is the Forestry Ministry, for instance, doing in Accra,” he quizzed. “What is the Agriculture Ministry doing in Accra?”</p>
      <p>Delivering a lecture at the Jophus Anamuah-Mensah Conference Hall at the University of Education, Winneba, the Chief called for a thorough decentralisation of power to aid the country’s development agenda.</p>
      <p>He explained this would “make people stay in their town and work” instead of migrating to the capital, Accra which is fast getting densely populated.</p>
      <p>“One Region, One Ministry,” he echoed, adding “if we have the courage to do this, our country would be turned around.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Control over schools</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Okyenhene also called for control over schools to be ceded totally to their Districts for efficient management and specific policy decisions.</p>
      <p>He also called on the government to pay teachers better in order to boost their morale and increase efficiency.</p>
      <p>“Buildings and technology do not teach our children, people do,” he said.</p>
