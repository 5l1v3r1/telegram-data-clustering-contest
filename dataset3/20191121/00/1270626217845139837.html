      <p>The Health Ministry says current stocks are being reserved for high-risk target groups which include residents of Serua/Namosi, children from the ages of 6 months to 3 years and people travelling overseas.</p>
      <p>People travelling overseas must show proof travel such as their ticket and travel itinerary and not just a passport.</p>
