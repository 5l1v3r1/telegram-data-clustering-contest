      <p>Tony Murrell told Mirror Online he was one of hundreds of flyers facing delays in Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>He said: "My wife and I and hundreds of others are stuck at Las Vegas airport.</p>
      <p>"We were first told at 10.34am there was a delay, the time now is 6.37pm (we're eight hours behind the UK).</p>
      <p>"We were due to go at 2.30pm, flight BA2276. Our plane is here and the captain has told us he cannot file his flight plan with Gatwick so we cannot take off.</p>
      <p>"There is another plane due to leave at 9pm for Heathrow, that will not be going either.</p>
      <p>"What we want to know is when will BA draw a line under it and organise buses to a hotel for night."</p>

      <p>She tweeted: "Currently at Edinburgh Airport standing in a queue waiting for information about our cancelled onward 2037 to Orlando International Airport."</p>
      <p>A British Airways spokesman responded to Ms Davidson, saying: "Due to technical issues a number of flights have been disrupted both yesterday and today.</p>
      <p>"The decision to cancel the flight didn't come soon enough for us to notify customers ahead of their arrival at the airport, which has put additional pressure on the resources we have at some our smaller outstations."</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user uploaded a picture showing their 11.40am flight from London to Orlando today had been cancelled.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for BA told Mirror Online: "Our teams are working hard to fix a technical issue causing delays to a small number of flights this evening​. </p>
