      <p>For the third time in 14 seasons, the Portland Trail Blazers are 5-10 to start a season. The previous two times show just how differently things could go from here.In 2005-06, the Blazers were 5-10, then lost six of their next seven games on their way to a 21-61 season that was among the worst in franchise history.</p>
      <p>Two years later, the Blazers not only started 5-10, but they lost their next two games, too. Then  something magical happened. The Blazers, under the same coach in Nate McMillan from two seasons before, went on a 13-game winning streak. The streak, pulled off by a young, likeable roster, reignited a franchise that had seen its fans abandon ship after all the Jail Blazers issues.</p>
      <p>That team ended up 41-41, and the next year they returned to the playoffs after a five-year drought.</p>
      <p>What direction will the 2019-20 team go after a 5-10 start? The immediate future looks challenging, with a game at Milwaukee looming Thursday. On Wednesday, team reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/CHold/status/1197294165798850565">Casey Holdhahl reported </a>that point guard Damian Lillard will miss his second game in a row with back spasms, and center Hassan Whiteside (right hip) and guard Anfernee Simons (left ankle) are questionable.</p>
      <p>This against a Bucks team that beat the then-healthy Blazers 143-100 in Milwaukee last season, the sixth most lopsided loss in franchise history for Portland.</p>
      <p>The Blazers have not waved the white hanky, but they did <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28124662/blazers-waive-pau-gasol-coaching-role-consideration">waive Pau Gasol </a>on Wednesday as the 39-year-old veteran has just not been able to recover from left foot surgery. Gasol might land a coaching role for Portland, so the franchise might still benefit from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/miketokito/2019/07/25/trail-blazers-add-championship-pedigree-injury-insurance-in-signing-pau-gasol/#75fce5a0330f">mentoring that was going to be his biggest contribution </a>anyway.</p>
      <p>The Blazers already are assured of a losing November after starting the month 2-8. Certainly, there are legitimate reasons for the Blazers’ struggles, starting with injuries, particularly to Zach Collins, but also with Lillard, Rodney Hood and Whiteside missing games. Collins and center Jusuf Nurkic will likely not be back until February at the earliest, but unless the Blazers can right the ship, their return might not mean much.</p>
      <p>There are some reasons for hope.</p>
      <p>The Blazers have played 10 of their 15 games on the road, with their next three games also away. Even though they are 1-4 at home, they figure to have a chance to re-establish the Moda Center as an asset again, with 12 of their next 16 after their current six-game road trip wraps up.</p>
      <p>Will newcomer Carmelo Anthony, at 35, really help? Coach Terry Stotts started him in his debut against New Orleans, and Anthony had 10 points, showing a few glimpses of his old self, but also some of the rust of not playing for more than a year. Coach Terry Stotts will have to figure out how best to use Anthony, and how other players can play off him – they too often stood and watched when Anthony tried to post up.</p>
      <p>Offense, though, isn’t the Blazers’ biggest problem. They are simply giving up too many points, an average of 115.3, which ranks 22<sup>nd</sup> in the league. And although historical franchise comparisons should be taken with a grain of salt because of differing eras, the average is flirting with bad history – the 115.3 points would rank as the third worst in franchise history, with the only worse seasons coming in the franchise first two years, 1970-71 and 1971-72.</p>
      <p>So yes, it’s early, but things really do have to improve for the Blazers to salvage this season.</p>
