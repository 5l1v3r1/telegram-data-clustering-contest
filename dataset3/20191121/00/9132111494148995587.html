      <p>There is growing Tension among members of the Health Service Workers Union (HSWU), the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) branch following the withdrawal of the appointment of Dr Baffour Awuah as the new Director-General of the Ghana Health Service (GHS), MyNewsGh.com reports.</p>
      <p>“Why should we always allow NPP and NDC to do divide us in the front of health and where from this nonsense?”, the National Representative of the HSWU in charge of Welfare at KATH, Mr Awuni Akyiriba fumed on radio discussion monitored by MyNewsGh.com.</p>
      <p>According to the Forensic Chartered Accountant at KATH, it is unfortunate that Dr Baffour Awuah, a former Medical Director of the facility has been withdrawn by President Akufo-Addo for obvious reasons.</p>
      <p>“Is that how politicians want to take Ghana to? Are they looking for competent people or foot soldiers who probably cannot do the work”, the outspoken social commentator quizzed</p>
      <p>Dr Baffour Awuah was appointed after Dr Anthony Nsiah- Asare, the former Director was reassigned to the presidency.</p>
      <p>Sources gathered that the termination of his appointment follows information forwarded to the seat of government by a Medical Team loyal to the New Patriotic Party that revealed the new GHS boss is an opposition NDC loyalist since 1992 but managed to warm his way into NPP after January 7th 2017.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Komfo Anokye Hospital NPP caucus made up of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other paramedical workers seize the rare pleasure to thank the president, His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for the appointment of Dr Baffour Awuah as the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service.</p>
      <p>“For those who claim Dr Baffour Awuah is an NDC member, are irredeemable liars whose pants are on fire.”</p>
      <p>“We therefore warmly congratulate Dr Baffour Awuah for his appointment and solemnly urge him to distinguish himself to bring glory to the big NPP family and the NPP Caucus of Kath Health Workers. Long live Nana Addo’s lead government, long live the great NPP Party and Kath NPP Caucus.”</p>
