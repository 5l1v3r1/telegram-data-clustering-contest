      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/queen-elizabeth/">Queen Elizabeth</a> and Prince Phillip have reached a milestone event in their marriage. The royal couple is celebrating their 72nd wedding anniversary.</p>
      <p>The official Instagram of the royal family posted a sweet throwback photo of the couple on their wedding day as they waved to their subjects from the balcony of Buckingham Palace on November 20, 1947, four months after they announced their engagement.</p>
      <p>In the black-and-white photo, Elizabeth, just five years short of being crowned the Queen of England, wore a stunning Norman Hartnell gown made of ivory silk and decorated with crystal accents. Phillip stood next to her in his military best, waving to the crowd who gathered to wish the couple well.</p>
      <p>That image was followed by a second and more current photo of the couple at an official palace event where the Queen is wearing a lovely purple suit and hat and is seen carrying a bouquet of flowers with Phillip by her side.</p>
      <p>Fans were thrilled to hear the news of the couple’s anniversary and penned their sentiments in the comments section of the photos seen below.</p>
