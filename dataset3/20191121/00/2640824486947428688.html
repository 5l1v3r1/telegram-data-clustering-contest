      <p><b>combining reclaimed construction waste with traditional indonesian craftsmanship, ZXC studio has renovated the <i>escalier </i><a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/retail-interiors/">clothing store</a> in potato head beach club, <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architecture-in-indonesia/">bali</a>. </b>situated at the front of the leisure complex, the existing retail space has been transformed to showcase the collection of brands on offer using a simple layout and a material palette to reflect the beach location.</p>

      <p><b>from the outside, passersby can catch a glimpse of <i>escalier’s</i> interior thanks to the expansive glazed façade that showcases the array of clothing. </b>inside, <a href="https://www.zxc-studio.com/">ZXC studio</a> has organized the shop using a series of square plinths positioned in the center of the floor, displaying highlighted products. the largest plinth draws visitors deeper into the space and is articulated by glass cases of jewelry, accessories and abstract decorative items. at the back of the store, a thin rectangular plinth houses the cashier, which overlooks the length of the space.</p>

      <p><b>to bring texture into the space, the plinths are dotted with fragments of red-pigmented concrete rubble that was collected from the construction site of the neighboring potato head hotel. </b>applied at varying scales throughout the store, from smaller pieces in the columns and walls, to larger chunks that decorate the floor surface, the crushed concrete evokes the idea of rocks or sand, perfectly befitting the beach locale.</p>

      <p><b>in juxtaposition to the dense and vivid ground plane, the ceiling floats lightly above the space.</b> a grid of woven rattan panels spans the surface, interrupted by a large lightbox that runs along the center. the rattan weave visually fragments the ceiling, its porosity engendering a sense of weightlessness. developed with specialists BYO living, the weave’s abstract geometric pattern resonates with the decorative textiles in escaliers’ collection, demonstrated through indonesian craftsmanship.</p>

      <p><b>the lightbox is surfaced in washi paper, which provides soft light to illuminate the displays below.</b> handmade at the workshop of bali-based artisan naruse kiyoshi, the washi is made from banana plant fibres, which subtly manifest in the surface texture. the interior concept of escalier was developed in close collaboration with owners emmelyn gunawan and resida irmine, together with potato head studio, the creative team behind the <a href="https://potatohead.co/">potato head beach club</a>.</p>
