      <p> Criticisms have trailed former Senate President Bukola Saraki’s hope of Nigeria hosting NBA games.</p>
      <p>Saraki had on Wednesday posted a picture of himself watching an NBA game involving the Lakers.</p>
      <p> In the accomplishing tweet, the ex-Governor of Kwara State wished that Nigeria could host a global basketball tournament.</p>
      <p> He tweeted, “In LA watching @KingJames  play for @Lakers.  Energy in the Arena is unmatched. In 2018 an exhibition NBA game was played in Pretoria, South Africa.</p>
      <p>“I’m hoping in the near future, Nigeria will host NBA games in a bid to grow the sport further in Nigeria. I am determined to see us achieve this.”</p>
      <p>While some of his followers hailed his determination, others queried what role he played to ensure the country hosted such high-profile games, when he was in power.</p>
      <p> One of them, who identified himself simply as Wale, said, “You should think of funding or founding a Nigerian basketball team. I like what you’ve done with ABS in the soccer scene. I’ve seen people really passionate about basketball in Nigeria. Basketball could be a big deal in Nigeria with proper funding and management.”</p>
      <p> Another Twitter user, Kazeem Bello, added, “For your eight years as the Governor of Kwara and another eight in the Senate, did you take time to watch any sporting events at the Kwara Stadium? The place doesn’t befit you!”</p>
      <p>Thor Roland clarified that “Nigeria can host basketball tournaments but not the NBA. The NBA is a North American league, a league that hosts American and Canadian teams. Hence, Nigeria cannot host it.”</p>
      <p> “Can you say with good conscience that such game could be held in the Kwara State you left behind? I have watched GS &amp; Charlotte Hornets in 2016, one thing I noticed on entering the stadium was the work force that was operational in that stadium. My next thought was how wicked our politicians are,” Okwudilichukwu added.</p>
