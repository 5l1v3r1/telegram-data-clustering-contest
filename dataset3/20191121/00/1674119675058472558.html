        <b>Chris Berrow &amp; Leigh Milner review Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris - So if you've ever played all of the Uncharted games it's very much like that. So it's like Uncharted 4 for example is super super slick. The lead actor who is you know the character in this game he plays Joker in Gotham and he's really like get Cameron Monahan who's honestly he's amazing in this first mission. It's like they spent all the money in the world on making the best ever ever star wars experience. I loved it. I was blown away. You saw it as well. I mean I did like Star Wars. So the first mission was probably the best I've ever played and I was thinking this is 10 out of 10 game I love it so much I going to carry on playing. I carried on playing the first mission very good. I'm on a fourth mission right now. It gets a bit more jerky later on. So your character it's not as smooth running for some weird reason. The further down the line you go there's something a bit weird where you get to like a meditation point as a Jedi and you go and relax your mind and you can heal and sp end your points and stuff like that. But when you do that and you hear yourself up all the enemies respawn for some unknown reason which wishes me any reset but it doesn't make any sense at all.</p>
      <p>Leigh - We love it though, definite must buy.Â </p>
