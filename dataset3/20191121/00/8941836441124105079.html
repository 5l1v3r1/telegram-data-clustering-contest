      <p>OSTERSUND, Sweden (AP) - The former chairman of Swedish soccer club Ostersund has appealed against his conviction for serious financial crimes.</p>
      <p>Daniel Kindberg was sentenced on Nov. 5 to three years in prison, banned from doing business for five years and ordered to pay damages after being found guilty of funneling millions of kronor in taxpayer money into Ostersund. The scheme involved two other men and three companies, one being the Ostersund municipality’s housing corporation for which Kindberg was chief executive.</p>
      <p>Kindberg said immediately after the verdict was handed down that he would appeal, describing it as “a legal scandal.” His defense lawyer, Olle Kullinger, says the appeal was submitted this week and will be heard in the Court of Appeal in Sundsvall, likely next year.</p>
      <p>Kulllinger said Kindberg is appealing against the conviction, the damages, and “regarding all points of the indictment.”</p>
      <p>Ostersund, which plays in Sweden’s top league, will not be facing any sanctions from the Swedish soccer association following Kindberg’s conviction.</p>
