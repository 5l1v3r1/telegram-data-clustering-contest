      <h1>Horrible Christian App Narcs to Your Mom If You Watch Porn</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Robitzski</a></address>
      <h3>Safesearch On</h3>
      <p>Evangelical Christians are enlisting AI in the holy war against pornography.</p>
      <p>Religious apps like Covenant Eyes act as a sort of AI-powered filter that not only blocks people from sneaking a quick glimpse at porn, but also shames them by flagging their activity in a report to their family or friends, <a href="https://www.cqpolitics.com/news/policy/christians-turn-artificial-intelligence-stop-porn-use">according to <i>CQ Roll Call</i></a>. The app is clearly built to further evangelical morals, and while it may be a useful tool for true believers or people trying to kick a habit, it’s worth noting just how bizarre it is to ask AI to keep on an eye on you in case you slip up.</p>
      <h3>Public Accountability</h3>
      <p>While it may be hard to imagine a worse hell than sending your mom a push notification — and a screenshot — every time you watch smut, similar tech could conceivably help kids <a href="https://futurism.com/australia-face-scan-watch-porn">steer clear of porn</a> as they take their first steps online.</p>
      <p>A large portion of Covenant Eyes’ customers — yes, they pay to use the app — are married men. But company spokesperson Dan Armstrong told <i>CQ Roll Call</i> that the same system could feasibly protect kids from getting airdropped nudes or other explicit content — something that doesn’t currently have a <a href="https://futurism.com/facebook-moderation-firm-just-quit">NSFW content filter</a> in place. But, as ever, we should be skeptical of high-tech “child-protecting” service that essentially eradicates their personal privacy.</p>
