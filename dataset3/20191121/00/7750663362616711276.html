      <p>After reacting angrily towards supporters who cheered his substitution against Crystal Palace last month, Xhaka is now considered out of favour at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>With the Switzerland international likely to leave the Gunners in January, a wide range of teams are contemplating a move for the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>Sky Sport Italia</i>, the two Milan clubs are in pole position to secure a deal at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The report claims that the Serie A giants are looking to put together a loan proposal with the option to buy in the summer.</p>
