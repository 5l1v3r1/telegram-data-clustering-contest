      <h1>Hate Speech Bill: Nigeria Governors Forum State Position</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The National Assembly has been advised by the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/ngf/"><u><b>Nigeria Governors’ Forum</b></u></a> to hear public view on the hate speech bill so that it will ensure that the views of Nigerians were captured in the passage of the bill.</p>
      <p>The Vice-Chairman of the forum, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/aminu-tambuwal/"><u><b>Aminu Tambuwal</b></u></a>, stated this while speaking with newsmen at the end of the meeting with Nigeria Governors on Wednesday, in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The Sokoto State governor urged the federal lawmakers to respect the views of Nigerians on the bill.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I am not sure I have heard any governor come out to say he is in support of the death penalty for hate speech.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“I believe the National Assembly should hold a public hearing on that bill so that due process of lawmaking is followed, so that the views of Nigerians not just the governors will be well captured on that bill.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“They should respect the views of Nigerians in whatever may be the direction of debate and the eventual passage or otherwise of that bill”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Tambuwal when asked by newsmen the position of governors on the Finance Bill submitted to the NASS by President Muhammadu Buhari to increase Value Added Tax (VAT) from five to 7.5. per cent, he pleaded with Nigerians to show more understanding with the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>The NGF vice chairman stated that governors were in support of the step that would improve the revenue generation drive of both the federal and state governments.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We are appealing to those who probably have no proper understanding of the context of those bills to kindly have a rethink of them and reflect on quantum of work ahead of us.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“As a country and states, we need a lot of resources to turn around infrastructure, to invest in education, healthcare and every sector of our national life.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“There is urgent need of more revenue in Nigeria. So, I appeal that we should show more understanding with the Federal Government in that regard”.</i>
