      <p>Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey, has told the global community that Ghana is taking pragmatic steps to ensure the protection of all its children.</p>
      <p>Madam Ayorkor Botchwey revealed this in her address during a High-Level Conference to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).</p>
      <p>The celebration was held on Wednesday, 20th November 2019 in Brussels, Belgium.</p>
      <p>Ghana made history by becoming the first country in the world to sign and ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990.</p>
      <p>The West African nation’s commitment to institutionalize the Rights of the Child, was further demonstrated when the country’s Legislature passed the Children’s Act in 1998 into law.</p>
      <p>According to the Hon. Minister, the Government of Ghana is taking pragmatic steps to address the issue of child abuse through the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for child protection which is guided by the Constitution and the Children’s Act of Ghana.</p>
      <p>She noted that Ghana’s Child and Family Welfare Policy seeks to promote the wellbeing of children, prevent abuse and protect children from harm.</p>
      <p>Madam Ayorkor Botchwey mentioned that other measures taken to tackle the issue of child abuse and labour with the aim of enhancing the wellbeing of children include: the strengthening of the legislative and regulatory framework; the establishment of a governance framework, which include key sector Ministries, such as the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection), as well as other government Departments and Agencies.</p>
      <p>She further mentioned that measures being taken to protect children in Ghana include: the adoption and commitment to national and international action plans such as the National Plan of Action for the Elimination of Worst Forms of Child Labour in Ghana (2017-2021); improvements in the school feeding programme, which aims to address child malnutrition, improve the enrollment, attendance and retention of children at the pre-school and primary levels in less privileged communities; the implementation of Free Senior High School (SHS) policy as well as emphasis on Technical and Vocational Education Training (TVET); and the implementation of the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), which is a cash transfer programme for extremely poor and vulnerable households.</p>
      <p>The target groups for LEAP, she revealed, include Orphaned and Vulnerable Children (OVC), elderly persons above 65 years and persons with severe disability without any productive capacity.</p>
