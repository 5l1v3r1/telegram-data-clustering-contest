      <h1>Cabinet approves stake sale in BPCL, four other PSUs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:23:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/annapurna-singh" target="_blank">Annapurna Singh</a></address>
      <p>The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved the sale of the government’s stake in five blue-chip public sector companies, including Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) and Container Corporation of India along with its management control to strategic buyers.</p>
      <p>The move comes in the wake of a tardy sale of PSUs so far this year, which has fetched the exchequer only a little above Rs 17,000 crore as against the asset sale target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in 2019-20.</p>
      <p>The government will sell 53.29% of its stake in BPCL. However, the Numaligarh Refinery in Assam in which BPCL, Indian Oil and Assam government have their shares, will not be divested.</p>
      <p>“Numaligarh would be carved out of BPCL before divestment,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. BPCL has 61% stake in Numaligarh refinery.</p>
      <p>This is the first strategic sale of a public sector oil company by the government. A strategic sale is one in which the controlling stake is sold to a private buyer.</p>
      <p>While the government will sell its entire 63.75% share in SCI, it will divest 30.8% in Concor to strategic buyers along with the management control.</p>
      <p>Besides, the government will sell its stake in THDC India and North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Ltd (NEEPCO) to state-owned NTPC Ltd.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet also approved cutting government’s stake in select public sector undertakings to below 51% while retaining the management control.</p>
      <p>The decision to carve the Numaligarh refinery out of BPCL was taken after protests staged by lawmakers from Assam inside parliament.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, BPCL shares hit a new high of Rs 548, up 6%, while SCI was up 11% after the news of the government’s plan of strategic disinvestment broke in the day.</p>
