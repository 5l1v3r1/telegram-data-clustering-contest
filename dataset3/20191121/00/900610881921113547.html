      <h1>IHG to open Kimpton Vividora in Barcelona’s Gothic quarter</h1>

      <p>Intercontinental Hotels Group will open its first Kimpton property in Spain early next year.</p>
      <p>The 156-room Kimpton Vividora Hotel will be located on Carrer del Duc in the city’s Gothic Quarter, and is now taking reservations from February 2020.</p>
      <p>Features include first floor restaurant Fauna, which will offer a menu “rooted in Mediterranean flavours and family recipes with a creative, Kimpton twist”, in a space “reminiscent of an elegant Barcelonian home”.</p>
      <p>There will also be a rooftop bar and pool, and a ground floor café.</p>
      <p>IHG acquired the Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants in 2015, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2017/05/17/kimpton-open-first-european-property-may-22/"><b>and opened the first European property under the brand in Amsterdam in 2017</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The brand has since debuted in the UK <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2018/09/20/ihg-to-add-uks-first-kimpton-hotel-next-month/"><b>with the rebranding of The Principal London last year</b></a>, followed by similar rebrandings of the <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/03/07/ihgs-kimpton-brand-debuts-in-edinburgh/"><b>Charlotte Square Hotel in Edinburgh</b></a>, and the <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/05/17/glasgows-blythswood-square-hotel-converts-to-kimpton/"><b>Blythswood Square Hotel in Glasgow</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The brand is also set to open a <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2018/11/27/ihg-to-open-kimpton-property-in-rotterdam/"><b>Rotterdam</b></a> property in 2022, as part of the mixed use POST development.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the news Mike Robinson, general manager, Kimpton Vividora Hotel, said:</p>
      <p>“We are very excited to bring Kimpton to Spain for the first time. From the thriving diversity and inclusiveness, to the passion for gastronomy and the arts, we couldn’t think of a more fitting first city than Barcelona.</p>
      <p>“We are honoured to be the Gothic Quarter’s new neighbour and member of the community, as well as soon becoming Barcelona’s best loved hotel.”</p>
