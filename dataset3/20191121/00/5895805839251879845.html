      <p>Maintaining holiday traditions is more powerful for our mental health than we may realize. Even if we feel resistant to seeing family over the holidays and can recall, with great distress, the feeling of morphing into our annoyed adolescent self the last time we visited family (and observing others repeating their annoying adolescent behaviors), the gift of ‘time traveling’ via repeated experiences from our <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">childhood</a> provides incalculable comfort as it helps integrate the continuity of our lives.</p>
      <p>Put another way, traditions make us feel younger. They provide an anchor and sense of meaning to our lives. They increase our ability to remember as we automatically reflect on prior experiences, including the expanding schemas of our development (like not being able to touch the stove when a turkey was cooking to later being taught how to cook the turkey).</p>
      <p>Continuing with the turkey theme (because Thanksgiving in America is just around the corner as I write this), I remember trying to rebel against Thanksgiving traditions one year when I was in great emotional pain after a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/divorce">divorce</a> and not having my daughter with me for the first time because she was with her father. A friend visited me from out of town and my great rebellious act was to have sushi instead of a turkey dinner. My friend was on board for the sushi rebellion, yet the plan backfired. We called every restaurant around and could not find any sushi restaurants that were open. Even the sushi at the grocery store wasn’t available. After lots of searching, we discovered one fancy seafood restaurant was open and were able to get a reservation. Turned out they only served a traditional turkey dinner that night.</p>
      <p>Looking back on that experience, I imagine the familiarity of being served a traditional Thanksgiving meal was a hidden blessing and probably unconsciously comforted me when I most needed it. (It’s an odd thing how we tend to pull away from people and things when we most need them.) Of course, my friend was an even bigger comfort—and we laughed about not being able to escape the turkey.</p>
      <p>Sometimes we are forced to endure a tradition and the benefits are hidden from our conscious. Other times, we are grieving the loss of loved ones and traditions provide the opportunity to keep them alive.</p>
      <p>This year I will make my great-grandmother’s corn pudding. I will also relive conversations with my mother (who passed a number of years ago) about how to make stuffing and Great-Grandma’s two different recipes for it and the one that was Grandpa’s favorite. I will remember all my loved ones that passed and all those that are far away. I will remember my childhood (and my daughter’s) as I cook familiar meals that generations before me created.</p>
      <p>The fondness of these memories shine so brightly that I find they burn away the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/trauma">traumas</a> from my past and cultivate infinite seeds of love and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gratitude">gratitude</a> for the good moments. And since cognitive research reveals that this time traveling gift of maintaining routines and traditions takes us back to our younger selves, perhaps my skin and body will get a little anti-aging boost alongside my brain.</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/counseling-keys">my articles</a> and sharing your thoughts and experiences when you do. Wherever you are and however you celebrate traditions in your family, may the practice of continuity provide healing and joy in your lives.</p>

      <p>There are those for whom memories are painful and those traditions were unhealthy.</p>
      <p>I say continue traditions that serve you today and positively impact your overall quality of life. Do not continue them if they subtract value from your life just because you did them as a child. For those who were fortunate to enjoy unscathed childhoods the holidays are fun, but for many, they are not.</p>
      <p>I preferred to forge my own traditions for the holidays and that may mean not having turkey for Thanksgiving. This is not a response to childhood deprivations, but an outgrowth of being an adult and making my own traditions and not necessarily following a holiday script that was laid down in childhood. But there are definitely some that need to recreate their childhoods and if that is healthy for them, then it is good, as long as they don't insist that other's follow suit if they choose not to engage in traditions that they find painful or outdated.</p>
