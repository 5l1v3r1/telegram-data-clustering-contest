      <p>About a year ago, I was approached by a publisher about possibly writing a book about mindful conflict resolution. I consulted with friends and colleagues, asked them what they wanted to see in a book with that title, and put together a table of contents. I sent the TOC to the representative, and shortly after was informed the publisher decided to pass. I wasn’t too upset about it, as I had been anything but mindful while going through a bad breakup just before they contacted me. When I informed those I had consulted that the publisher passed, they said I should write it anyhow. I have no intention of doing so, but figured a post or two here might adequately sum up the relevant content I really wanted to include.</p>
      <p>
        <b><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/mindfulness">Mindfulness</a>: It isn’t New, or New Age-y</b>
      </p>
      <p>My blog is bursting with writing on mindfulness, and though I do not wish to be redundant, a brief encapsulation might be in order. Mindfulness is not new or New Age-y. It has been a part of eastern religions (Buddhism, Zen) and psychology, basically since their inception (for more on this, see my post <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201503/psychotherapy-and-meditation-means-the-same-end">Psychotherapy and Meditation: Means to the Same End</a>). Jon Kabat-Zinn, a western authority on mindfulness, defines it as “the awareness that arises from paying <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attention">attention</a> on purpose, in the present moment, nonjudgmentally” (Simon). Some people simply call it awareness. Some call it being present. Regardless, it is the act of quieting the mind to pay absolute attention to the moment.</p>
      <p>This is easier said than done (as are most things, and if interested you can read more about that in my post, “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201807/everything-is-easier-paper">Everything is easier on paper</a>”). Humans are not built to be mindful. The human brain stores information for easy access and almost <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/unconscious">unconscious</a> action, (or, to use the psychological term, functional unconscious). In addition to the human brain’s desire to make action unconscious are the years of conditioning that has occurred, again contributing to automatic responses. To be mindful is to resist these urges, or better, to quiet the mind so there is only awareness of the urge to act without action, observed without judgement.</p>
      <p>This is even more difficult in relationships. As people interact, a schema develops. The brain becomes wired to interact in predictable and consistent ways. The closer the relationship, the more interaction occurs, the more these patterns become hardwired. Again, the brain desires to conserve energy and make behavior automatic, and thereby the interactions become more and more unconscious.</p>
      <p>One of the issues with interactions between loved ones becoming more and more unconscious is that the attention that contributed to the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/attachment">bonding</a> dissipates. No one is more attentive to another than one who is enamored. But once the priorities shift, to work, to kids, to all of the other things that make up life, consciousness shifts to those priorities. This is normal, functional, evolutionary.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Modular Theory of Mind</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the aspects of the modular theory of the mind is that whatever evolutionary need is at the forefront, that module drives thoughts and behavior. Other needs that are satiated are on autopilot. Once a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/relationships">romantic relationship</a> is stable, this results in routine and rote responses and dialogues, focus on the family or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/career">career</a>, and a general apathy may develop. Many feel this is just the natural course of a relationship. Though it may be common, it is not the healthiest way of being.</p>
      <p>Because the focus becomes other needs, there are times a spouse or partner is perceived as an obstacle or stressor. When the mind senses threat, the module for defense is activated. Partners may begin to see one another in a negative rather than positive light. The other’s intentions are perceived maliciously. This perception is often skewed by the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stress</a> and feeling defensive, but seems an accurate perception at the time.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Switch-tracking</b>
      </p>
      <p>As I wrote in the “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-second-noble-truth/201601/mindful-arguing">Mindful Arguing</a>”, Sheila Heen discusses “switch-tracking”, where a couple discusses two different issues which are held together by a thread (Vedantam, 2015). This is a common drawback in relations. In these cases the couple argues about two separate aspects of the same incident. This is a direct result of defensiveness.</p>
      <p>As I wrote in the above post, the podcast uses the example of a husband bringing home flowers for his wife. His wife argues he doesn’t listen, as she does not like getting cut flowers, and he argues about her ingratitude. Though the flowers are the common thread, the couple is debating two separate aspects. (Vedantam, 2015).</p>
      <p>
        <b>How Mindfulness can Help</b>
      </p>
      <p>One can become mindful of his own perceptional biases, accept his or her view may be biased and not act on it, and be more present. Being present can solve many relational issues. Many problems begin with someone not feeling heard. I have often described part of couples <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/coaching">counseling</a> as interpreting each other’s words in a more neutral or positive way. This is because a partner often negatively interprets his partner’s intentions.</p>
      <p>Mindfulness delays judgement, slows the modular mind and results in an open minded approach rather than a defensive approach. This can work wonders in a relationship, not only by defusing an argument, but by allowing a partner to feel the other’s presence, which is essential to healthy relations. None of this is easy. It requires consciousness, which requires effort. It requires leaving the brain’s default mode of functioning, and taking control of it. It takes fighting off instinct, and settling into the moment. The payoff, however, can be more loving and mindful coupling.</p>
