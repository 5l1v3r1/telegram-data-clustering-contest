        <b>Motorsport UK has unveiled a new investment strategy for the future in a bid to promote the sport more, but clubs are concerned by an increase to event permit fees.</b>
      </p>
      <p>British motorsport's governing body - which rebranded in 2018 - has revealed a raft of changes for next year as it tries to simplify its structure and raise additional income to allow it to reinvest more into the sport.</p>
      <p>It is seeking extra income to not only increase promotion but also offer more education and training initiatives, as well as to fund future innovation projects.</p>
      <p>By investing in these key areas, Motorsport UK hopes to try to secure the future of motorsport in the UK against a backdrop of reducing numbers of licence holders and an aging demographic of participants.</p>
      <p>Motorsport UK also intends to offer more to members and has already launched a range of discounts and offers.</p>
      <p>It has also scrapped licence fees for officials, taken away the requirement for all drivers aged between 45 and 60 to have a medical to receive a licence, and increased the amount of personal accident insurance cover that is included with a licence.</p>
      <p>In order to help fund the investment strategy, Motorsport UK has sought to raise additional income from a number of sources, including from licence fee and event permit fee increases.</p>
      <p>The organisation has tweaked its licence structure - adding in a free of charge grassroots RS Clubman licence - and circuit racing licence fees have increased between 3% for some of the International licences and 55% for the new Interclub (formerly National B) licence.</p>
      <p>An International C licence has risen from £214 to £220, a National from £101 to £155 and the new Interclub is £99, up from £64.</p>
      <p>These increases have also been replicated in other disciplines, like rallying.</p>
      <p>Almost all event permit fees - the amount clubs have to pay to Motorsport UK per entry at each event - have also increased by a standard £5.</p>
      <p>For the larger clubs, the fee is expected to represent a five-figure rise in permit fees paid to Motorsport UK.</p>

      <p>"We studied the challenges very carefully, and concluded we need a fresh approach and a five-year plan to reinvest in the sport," said Motorsport UK CEO Hugh Chambers.</p>
      <p>"This will involve a rebalancing of the economics, and in time, the diversification of revenues away from our current reliance on the competitors.</p>
      <p>"In the short term we have new initiatives that will bring money into the sport and ease that burden right away."</p>
      <p>Racing clubs can understand the change in licence fees but are worried about the impact of the increase in event permit charges.</p>
      <p>"It's disappointing," British Racing and Sports Car Club chairman Peter Daly told Autosport.</p>
      <p>"Motorsport UK is actively working to try and promote the sport but they are using the hard-earned cash of people that have been supporting the sport for years. It's the clubmen that are being hit pretty hard.</p>
      <p>"An increase in entry fees is a small percentage in the budget of circuit racing but increases in fees become a barrier to people competing in motorsport - it's such an emotive topic.</p>

      <p>"I fully understand the other side of it. A competitor may spend £1000 on new tyres to go a tenth of a second quicker and they also moan about an increase of £10 in entry fees, but that's the competitor's choice."</p>
      <p>British Automobile Racing Club general manager Ian Watson added: "Any time that prices go up, it concerns us.</p>
      <p>"I can see a lot of logic in the licence fee changes because of the benefits competitors can get in return. "</p>
      <p>The permit fees is a completely separate issue. It will hit us quite hard in terms of the amount of money we have to give to Motorsport UK."</p>
