      <h1>Robinson’s record night helps Heat beat Cavs 124-100</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">TIM REYNOLDS</a></address>
      <p>MIAMI (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">John Beilein</a> had seen <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Duncan Robinson</a> get on hot shooting stretches plenty of times before.</p>
      <p>None of those were at his expense.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a> put on a show for his college coach - and got himself into the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> record book as well. He set team marks with seven 3-pointers in the second quarter, eight in the first half and finished with a career-high 29 points as the Heat rolled past <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> 124-100 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>“That young man the last two years has developed with the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> culture,” said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a>, the first-year <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> coach who had <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a> for three seasons at Michigan. “He’s developed his game into a whole different level. … Part of it you hate, but it’s also part of your blood.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a> was 9 for 15 from the field, all of them coming from 3-point range.</p>

      <p>His early flurry helped <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> tie a franchise mark with 75 first-half points. The lead was 27 at the break and the Heat stayed in control the rest of the way. Kevin Love’s jumper with 9:07 left got Cleveland to 102-86 and capped a 13-3 run, but the Cavs didn’t get any closer.</p>
      <p>“It’s not lost on me that Coach B has done so much for my career,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a> said. “So it’s pretty cool to have us competing on a stage like this. We’re very competitive people so it’s nice to come out on top, but I’m also very appreciative of everything he’s done for me.”</p>
      <p>Tyler Herro scored 22 points for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>, which had no problem on a night when Jimmy Butler missed 12 of his first 13 shots and finished with 21 points anyway.</p>
      <p>“We can’t keep surprising people,” Butler said. “We’re for real. I don’t think anybody wants to play against us and that’s the way we want to keep it.”</p>

        <p>Love scored 25 and grabbed 13 rebounds for Cleveland. Collin Sexton added 19 points.</p>
        <p>The Heat record for 3-pointers in a game is 10, a mark held by Mario Chalmers and Brian Shaw. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a> had three shots in the final moments to get his 10th - missing them all. He connected on one with about 15 seconds left, but it was waved off by a shot clock violation.</p>
        <p>It was Cleveland’s 17th consecutive loss in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a>, a stretch that started during the 2010-11 season - LeBron James’ first with the Heat after leaving the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> for the first time.</p>
        <p>The Heat record for 3-pointers in a half had been six, held by many and done most recently by Wayne Ellington in the second half against Toronto on April 11, 2018. The record for 3s in a quarter also was six - Ellington did that twice (the Toronto game in 2018, and against Atlanta in 2017), and Shaw did it first against Milwaukee in 1993.</p>
        <p>Those marks belong to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a> now. He had 24 points by halftime, all on 3-pointers. That was better than his previous career best of 23, set at home earlier this season against Houston.</p>
        <p>“You couldn’t be more happy for a guy like <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Duncan</a> because he puts in so much time,” Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/duncan-robinson/">Robinson</a>’s high in three seasons under <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a> at Michigan was 21. His only 30-point effort in college came in 2014 - for Williams against Amherst in the 2014 NCAA Division III semifinals, before he was given a scholarship by Michigan. His G League high last season was 36 for Sioux Falls.</p>
        <p>“I’m really proud of him,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/john-beilein/">Beilein</a> said. “All of Michigan is proud of him.”</p>
        <p>TIP-INS</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a>: Cleveland’s 17-game losing streak at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> has included 74 players and six coaches. The Cavs’ last win in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> was Jan. 25, 2010. … Cleveland starters Cedi Osman, Darius Garland and Sexton were a combined 2 for 17 for seven points in 43 first-half minutes. They didn’t start the second half.</p>
        <p>Heat: <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami/">Miami</a> improved to 10-3, tying the best 13-game start in team history. The 1995-96, 1999-2000, 2012-13 and 2013-14 Heat also were 10-3. … Bam Adebayo was 4 for 4 in the opening three minutes and finished 5 for 5. … Spoelstra improved to 533-366 in 899 games as Heat coach. His milestone 900th is Friday in Chicago.</p>
        <p>HEAT AT HOME</p>
        <p>The Heat are 6-0 at home, the first time that’s happened since 2012-13. The biggest deficit they’ve faced at home this season is eight points - every other team in the league has trailed by more at home at least once.</p>
        <p>THOMPSON RESTS</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> gave Tristan Thompson the night off to rest, mindful that they have a back-to-back later this week. It was the first game Thompson has missed this season - but the third straight <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/cleveland-cavaliers/">Cavaliers</a> at Heat game in which he hasn’t played.</p>
