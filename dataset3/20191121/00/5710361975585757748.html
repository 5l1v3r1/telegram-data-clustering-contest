      <p>By Thyagaraju Adinarayan</p>
      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Global stocks slid further on Thursday as the standoff between the world's two largest economies extended beyond trade, reducing the odds of a "phase-one" deal this year and forcing investors to seek shelter in safe-haven assets.</p>
      <p>The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed two bills intended to support protesters in Hong Kong and send a warning to China about human rights.</p>
      <p>With U.S. President Donald Trump seen likely to sign the bill, Deutsche Bank (DE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/deutsche-bank">DBKGn</a>) strategist Jim Reid said this "could risk progress towards a phase one trade deal".</p>
      <p>European shares extended their losses from Wednesday with the pan-European STOXX 600 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/stoxx-600">STOXX</a>) and the trade-sensitive Germany's DAX 30 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/germany-30">GDAXI</a>) both sliding 0.7% to fresh two-week lows.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/ac-asia-p-xjp">MIAPJ0000PUS</a>) fell 1.1% to a near three-week lows, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/hang-sen-40">HSI</a>) tumbling 1.6% while Japan's Nikkei (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/japan-ni225">N225</a>) dropped 0.5%. Chinese mainland shares dropped 0.3% (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/shanghai-composite">SSEC</a>).</p>
      <p>U.S. S&amp;P500 futures (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures">ESc1</a>) were down 0.2%, having dropped as much as 0.6% in Asian trade, a day after all three major indexes fell, with the S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">SPX</a>) losing 0.4%.</p>
      <p>"The cracks in equity market sentiment widened a little further yesterday, although this setback remains modest in the context of the index gains enjoyed so far in Q4," Ian Williams (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/williams-cos">WMB</a>), economics &amp; strategy research analyst at Peel Hunt, said.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">SPX</a>) had hit a record high as recently as Tuesday on trade deal hopes, but Washington's move on Hong Kong derailed the rally.</p>
      <p>Trade experts and people close to the White House said completion of a "phase one" U.S.-China trade deal could slide into next year, as Beijing presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks, and the Trump administration counters with demands of its own.</p>
      <p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, also the chief trade negotiator, said he was "cautiously optimistic" on a phase one deal, according to a report by Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>CAUTIOUS</p>
      <p>As the chances of a deal in the near-term faded, investors sought the safety of government bonds, the yen and gold.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/xau-usd">Spot gold</a> climbed 0.2% to $1,473.56 per ounce as of 0852 GMT.</p>
      <p>German government bond yields (<a href="https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/germany-10-year-bond-yield">DE10YT=RR</a>) -- which move inversely to price -- steadied a day after hitting more than two week lows. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dipped to 1.733% (<a href="https://www.investing.com/rates-bonds/u.s.-10-year-bond-yield">US10YT=RR</a>), near its lowest levels in three weeks.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/usd-cny">Chinese yuan</a> hit three-week lows, trading as low as 7.0450 to the dollar in onshore trade.</p>
      <p>The dollar was soft against the yen at 108.59 , compared to this week's high of 109.07 touched on Monday. Japan's currency has rallied almost 1% from more than five-month lows hit against the greenback earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"Our short-term strategy remains fairly cautious, as markets are very narrowly driven – every positive piece of news in trade negotiations sends markets higher, while any disappointment – sinks," Marija Veitmane, Senior Strategist at State Street (NYSE:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/state-street">STT</a>) Global Markets said.</p>
      <p>"This makes it very hard for investors to build positions in risk trades."</p>
      <p>The euro gained slightly and was last trading at $1.1077 (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/eur-usd">EUR=</a>) ahead of the release of the latest European Central Bank's policy meeting minutes.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, oil prices dipped, paring some of their 2% gains made on Wednesday after a better-than-expected U.S. crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with OPEC to keep the market balanced.</p>
      <p>Global benchmark Brent futures (<a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/brent-oil">LCOc1</a>) dropped 0.5% to $62.08. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures (<a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">CLc1</a>) were down 0.5% at $56.73 per barrel in early Thursday trade.</p>
