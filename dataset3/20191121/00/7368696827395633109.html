      <p>Valve has been super-busy as of late and later today, they will reveal <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/half-life-alyx-story-and-gameplay-details-revealed/">Half-Life: Alyx</a> to the world after dropping the first <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/new-cs-go-operation-shattered-web-released-by-valve/">new CS: GO Operation</a> in years and it is also expected that the massive next update for Dota 2 will drop on Monday. However, that doesn’t mean the company doesn’t have time for a new Steam sale to celebrate the full launch of Remote Play Together.</p>

      <p>The Steam Remote Play Together feature allows users to join local co-op, local multiplayer, and split-screen games online and only the host needs to own and install the game. It is a great feature that has been in beta since late October and now, to celebrate the full launch, Valve is having a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/together">new Steam sale</a> on games that support the feature, with some great discounts on a variety of titles.</p>
      <p>Valve explains in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3605623508389954946">a post on Steam</a> that:</p>
      <blockquote>After roughly one month in beta, Steam Remote Play Together is now released to all Steam users. With this feature, local multiplayer gaming is now extended to iOS and Android devices. Remote Play Together enables cross-platform play among friends across Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Up to four players, or even more in ideal conditions, can instantly join in the fun. Only the host needs to own and install the game, while additional players connect through Steam Remote Play streaming technology using their PC or the Steam Chat and Steam Link mobile apps.</blockquote>
