      <p>FENWICK ISLAND, Del. (AP) - A proposed offshore wind farm off the coast of Delaware has received a wave of criticism from residents who live around Fenwick Island State Park.</p>
      <p>News outlets report hundreds of people attended a meeting about the proposal Tuesday in Dagsboro. The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control announced last month it was negotiating an agreement with state park officials and Denmark-based company Ørsted for the Skipjack Wind Farm Project.</p>
      <p>The project would bring offshore windmills to Delaware’s southern coast in exchange for $18 million in improvements to the state park. It would also supply power to about 35,000 homes.</p>

        <p>Some attendees worried the wind farm would sour the coastal view. Others accused leaders of a lack of transparency about the plan. Supporters praised the environmental benefits of wind energy.</p>
