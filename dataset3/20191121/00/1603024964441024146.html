      <p>The opposition Congress on Thursday raised in Lok Sabha the issue of electoral bonds, saying it has made corruption "official".</p>
      <p>Raising the issue during Zero Hour, Manish Tewari said despite reservations expressed by the Reserve Bank of India and the Election Commission, the government went ahead with the scheme.</p>
      <p>Congress members later walked out of proceedings.</p>
      <p>Under the electoral bonds scheme, the government has offered complete anonymity to those making donations. A donor could now anonymously buy a bond, and deposit it with the political party of his or her choice.</p>
