      <p><b>Topline:</b> The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show <a href="https://fortune.com/2019/11/21/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2019-cancelled/">will not</a> go on this year, the latest setback for parent company L Brands, which has seen its share price fall 30% this year amid changing consumer tastes and ongoing unease about chief executive Leslie Wexner’s past ties to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer said the fashion show would be canceled during a Wednesday <a href="http://investors.lb.com/events/event-details/q3-2019-l-brands-earnings-conference-call">earnings call</a> and added that the company is “evolving” its messaging and cutting back on costly marketing events.</li>
        <li>L Brands also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/l-brands-lb-earnings-q3-2019.html">fell short</a> of expected revenue for the quarter ending in September, and Victoria’s Secret was particularly hard-hit, with a 7% decline in business compared to the same quarter last year.</li>
        <li>By making Epstein his money manager, L Brands’ 81-year-old billionaire chief executive Leslie Wexner is widely believed to have given Epstein a foothold to enter the world of the ultrarich.</li>
        <li>Wexner, who <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/07/12/jeffrey-epsteins-dark-faade-finally-cracks/#21dd36c229cf">once called</a> Epstein “very smart” and “a loyal friend,” disavowed his relationship with Epstein after his arrest on federal sex trafficking charges⁠—and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/07/business/wexner-epstein.html">accused</a> the disgraced financier of misappropriating over $46 million of his personal fortune. </li>
        <li>Wexner has remained largely unscathed from his Epstein ties; no investors or board members have called for his resignation.</li>
        <li>L Brands has, however, hired <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-25/l-brands-confirms-it-will-review-epstein-s-role-at-company-jyio6cw8">outside counsel</a> to review the company’s relationship with Epstein.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>What we don’t know:</b> Which path L Brands might take to right its ship. Wexner was <a href="http://nebula.wsimg.com/08b1d06193420e3aea1414d9120cfa80?AccessKeyId=AA915E33CC4D6C3F7A74&amp;amp;amp;disposition=0&amp;amp;amp;alloworigin=1">advised by </a>hedge fund Barington Capital in March to either spin off Victoria’s Secret or attempt an IPO for Bath &amp; Body Works. With share <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/les-wexner-says-he-was-unaware-of-epstein-s-illegal-activity">prices dropping</a> more than 60% over the past four years, L Brands (and particularly Victoria’s Secret) has struggled to find a place within consumers’ new preferences as well as in a world changed by #MeToo, according to Bloomberg. </p>
      <p><b>Key background:</b> Epstein managed Wexner’s money for decades⁠—and was given Wexner’s power of attorney⁠—with many speculating that the billionaire was Epstein’s only client. Wexner <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/les-wexner-says-he-was-unaware-of-epstein-s-illegal-activity">addressed</a> his relationship with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/07/12/jeffrey-epsteins-dark-faade-finally-cracks/#c2f5cd429cf1">Epstein</a> in a July email to employees, about one month before Epstein died by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/08/10/jeffrey-epstein-accused-child-sex-trafficker-dies-by-suicide-in-jail/?utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=2547286974&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesMainTwitter#7546904b5169">suicide</a> in a Manhattan jail. And in a September speech to investors, Wexner expressed embarrassment at “being taken advantage of by someone who is...so depraved.” He also called Epstein’s sex trafficking allegations “egregious” and “sickening,” and reiterated that he had severed ties with Epstein long ago. </p>
      <p><b>News peg:</b> <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/07/12/jeffrey-epsteins-dark-faade-finally-cracks/">Epstein</a> previously faced a 2007 federal sex crimes indictment that accused him of sexually abusing dozens of underage girls. He served only 13 months in a Florida jail after conviction on a prostitution charge and registered as a sex offender, after a plea deal that was widely criticized as too lenient. Epstein was indicted July 6, 2019, by federal prosecutors, and he was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/07/08/this-time-us-prosecutors-charge-jeffrey-epstein-with-sex-trafficking-and-conspiracy/#590f88f51d52">charged with</a> sex trafficking and sex conspiracy. He pleaded not guilty and was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/07/18/judge-denies-bail-for-jeffrey-epstein-in-sex-trafficking-case/">denied bail</a>.</p>
