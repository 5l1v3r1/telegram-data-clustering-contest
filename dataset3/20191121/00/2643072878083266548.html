      <p>Professor <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/itse-sagay/"><u>Itse Sagay</u></a></b>, SAN, Chairman of the <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/pacac/"><u>Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption, PACAC</u></a></b>, has said only corrupt elites do not see any positive difference in the President <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/muhammadu-buhari/"><u>Muhammadu Buhari</u></a></b>-led anti-corruption war.</p>
      <p>This Sagay said in Abuja when he led members of the committee on a solidarity visit to the <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/efcc/"><u>Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)</u></a></b>.</p>
      <p>Acording to him, President Buhari’s administration has been very helpful in the anti-graft war.</p>
      <p>“<i>When Nigerians pretend by asking what difference has his government brought in the fight against corruption, it amazes me.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“For me, it is a sign of bad faith being expressed by the elites who were the beneficiaries of corruption.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“So, they are undergoing the pains of having to earn their living rather than simply collecting unearned money, easy money that used to go round the country.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“These are people who were building edifices without sign of employment of any sort,</i>” Sagay said.</p>
      <p>The professor of law attributed much of the success story to efforts of the EFCC, which he said had surpassed other agencies in the fight against corruption.</p>
