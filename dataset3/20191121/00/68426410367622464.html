      <p>A jury in New Zealand on Friday convicted a 27-year-old man of murdering a British woman backpacker, media said, in a case that shocked the Pacific nation.</p>
      <p>Grace Millane, 22, went missing in Auckland on Dec. 1 last year, while travelling after finishing university. Police found her body on Dec. 9 in bushland just a few metres from a scenic drive in the Waitakere Ranges.</p>
      <p>The man, whose name has been suppressed by the court, met Millane on the evening of Dec. 1 through dating app Tinder, the jury heard. He pleaded not guilty to murder, arguing that she died accidentally during consensual sex.</p>
      <p>The jury rejected the argument, to convict him just hours after beginning deliberations, the New Zealand Herald said, adding he is to be sentenced on Feb. 21.</p>
      <p>Millane’s parents, David and Gillian, were present throughout the trial, which gripped the public, still reeling from the backbacker’s death.</p>
      <p>“Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever,” the paper quoted her father as saying outside the court.</p>
      <p>“(The verdict) will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure...Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.”</p>
      <p>The judge thanked the jurors for their service in what he called a particularly difficult case.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people held candlelight vigils after Millane’s death in a national outpouring of grief, with Prime Minister Jacinda Arden holding back tears in an apology to Millane’s family on behalf of the country</p>
