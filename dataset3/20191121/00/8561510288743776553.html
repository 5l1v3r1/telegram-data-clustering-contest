      <h1>Unusual PhD Thesis: Let’s Use Bacteria to Colonize Mars</h1>

      <h3>Bacterial Colony</h3>
      <p>A Ph.D. student has an unusual idea for terraforming and <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/thousands-years-colonize-mars">colonizing Mars</a>: send spacecrafts, loaded up with bacteria, and let them do the bulk of the work.</p>
      <p>By sending specific microbes to Mars, Delft University of Technology doctoral candidate Benjamin Lehner argues that humans who make the journey years later will arrive at a planet full of raw materials that could be used to build a settlement rather than <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-mars-city-1000-starship">bringing things with them</a>. It’s an unusual proposal, but a <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-mars-base-bacteria.html">university press release</a> reports that both NASA and the ESA are interested.</p>
      <h3>Self-Contained</h3>
      <p>Seeding Mars with microbes, of course, would completely ruin astrobiologists’ attempts to find <a href="https://futurism.com/nasa-scientist-found-life-on-mars">traces of extraterrestrial life</a> there. To prevent cross-planetary contamination, Lehner designed a closed-loop system to gather Martian soil, extract minerals, and turn them into useful materials.</p>
      <p>The short version is that a rover — basically a robot shovel — will bring soil to a bioreactor full of bacteria, which will consume the iron-rich but unusable soil and digest it into a more useful oxide. After that, a 3D printer can make tools and whatever else future settlers might need.</p>
      <h3>Slow Progress</h3>
      <p>Lehner’s research suggests it would take years for the bacteria to produce enough iron to be useful, so his proposal is far from a quick answer to the challenges of space colonization.</p>
      <p>And that’s all assuming the research is sound to begin with — the doctoral candidate will defend his thesis on Friday, at which point it will be clearer whether the proposed terraforming system is actually feasible.</p>
