      <h1>Keep up with your credit goals even during the holidays</h1>
      <h2>There’s one type of holiday TV commercial that gets to me every year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/jeanne-kelly/" target="_blank">Jeanne Kelly</a></address>
      <p>It’s those car commercials where unsuspecting loved ones are surprised with a beautiful luxury car (or two) with a big red bow on it. These ads run so frequently that it’s almost like everyone is giving and getting new cars for holiday gifts! </p>
      <p>Yes, perhaps this is a bit dramatic, but seriously I don’t know anyone – including myself –  that doesn’t spend more money than planned during the holiday season. It’s especially hard for those working to repair their credit and get their financial house in order, this can be an especially tough time of year. Well, not to worry, I’ve got your back and I’m here to guide you to a joyful, abundant holiday season without derailing your credit and financial goals. </p>
      <p>The first step is to remember, whether you’ve got to create a new home screen on your smartphone, write it on your bathroom mirror or repeat it to yourself over and over every time you open the doors of the department store: <b><i>love is not measured in stuff, joy cannot be bought, and peace has no price tag</i></b>. </p>
      <p><b><i>Are you with me?</i></b> If so, I’ve got a few tips to share with you that will help you to keep going with your credit goals, even during the holiday season. This is not the time to coast on your financial goals. Keep going with a plan and you can be successful. You could even use the season to improve your credit score! Here’s how:</p>
      <p><b>Tip #1 – Plan ahead for your spending.</b> Before the holiday shopping season gets rolling, you need to create a realistic plan and budget. Create a list of all the gift-giving you will do, as well as any other holiday spending like travel, etc. Have a total budget number in mind and assign an amount of how much you will spend on each item or person so that it all fits within your total budget. I don’t know about you but I always manage to forget a few people for gift-giving, so make sure you build a cushion into your plan for those ‘oops I forgot’ gifts. </p>
      <p>Now, it’s time to go shopping!</p>
      <p><b>Tip #2 – Pay in cash.</b> The safest way to pay for holiday purchases so that you don’t spend more than you planned is to pay with cash. Yes, I know many of us shop online and don’t use paper cash so you can do the same by paying with your debit card. When you head out to the store, consider paying for gifts with cash and when the cash is gone, shopping is done. </p>
      <p><b>Tip #3 – Pay with credit and pay off right away.</b> You could also choose to pay with your credit card. If you do, be very careful not to overspend, especially if this has been a problem for you in the past. Have an accountability partner to help you stay on track. If you can handle it, charge your purchases and then pay them off right away. </p>
      <p><b>Tip #4 – Don’t max out credit cards</b>. If you do end up using your credit cards, avoid overcharging them. You always want your balance to remain below 10% of the total available credit. Keeping low balances also helps maintain a high credit score. </p>
      <p><b>Tip #5 – Have fun!</b> If in the past you have fretted about holiday bills in January and suffered from the holiday spending hangover. I invite you to do it differently this year. Imagine waking up on New Year’s Day with no worries, no extra bills to pay and no additional money stress. How would that feel? </p>
      <p>Holiday spending with a plan is incredibly fun and free of worry. It just may bring you some of that extra love, joy, and peace we all could use more of!</p>
      <p>Happy Holidays!</p>
      <p>Cheers~</p>
