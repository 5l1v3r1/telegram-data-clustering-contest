      <p>U.S. President Donald Trump, facing lawsuits and political demands to release his U.S. tax returns and other financial information, said on Thursday he will release a statement on his finances before the presidential election, and asserted that it was his call on providing the information.</p>
      <p>“I’m clean, and when I release my financial statement (my decision) sometime prior to election, it will only show one thing – that I am much richer than people even thought – And that is a good thing,” Trump said in a post on Twitter, providing no details on his claims of wealth.</p>
      <p>Trump also said Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s two-year investigation into Russian interference in elections, which most recently led to the criminal conviction of Trump’s former adviser Roger Stone, showed that his finances were in order.</p>
      <p>Mueller “went over all of my financials, &amp; my taxes, and found nothing. Now the Witch Hunt continues with local New York Democrat prosecutors going over every financial deal I have ever done. This has never happened to President before. What they are doing is not legal,” Trump wrote.</p>
      <p>Trump, an international hotelier and former reality TV star, is the first major-party presidential candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 not to release his tax returns.</p>
      <p>Last week a federal judge dismissed New York’s attorney general and state tax commissioner as defendants in Trump’s lawsuit seeking to block a congressional committee from obtaining his New York state tax returns. New York passed a law earlier this year that would allow the committee to access Trump’s state tax returns.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, an appeals court in New York has ruled that Trump’s long-time accounting firm must hand over eight years of his tax returns to New York prosecutors.</p>
