      <p>The Minister for Regional Reorganisation and Development, Dan Kwaku Botwe, has called for the cancellation of the December 17 referendum which is to decide whether political parties should sponsor candidates in district level elections.</p>
      <p>“Why should we spend money on referendum when there is rains and roads and we cannot make roads. Why should we waste so much money on that.</p>
      <p>“It is not a national (priority). They should leave it since we are reducing cost. Nothing will change if we postpone it,” the former NPP General Secretary told Starr News Ibrahim Alhassan Thursday.</p>
      <p>The comments come in the wake of growing division over the referendum and what either outcomes will hold for the development of the country.</p>
      <p>Members of the National House of Chiefs are also divided over their position on the exercise. While the President of the House of Chiefs says they support a ‘no vote’, some key members of the body have openly broken ranks with their leader.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the main opposition NDC is canvassing for a ‘no vote’ while the President and his ruling party have declared support for the opposite.</p>
      <p>The NDC contends introducing political parties into local level elections will further deepen the partisan politics in communities</p>
      <p>Article 55 (3) of the 1992 Constitution, which is an entrenched provision, states that “Subject to the provisions of this Article, a political party is free to participate in shaping the political will of the people, to disseminate information on political ideas, social and economic programmes of a national character; and sponsor candidates for election to any public office other than the district assemblies or lower local government units”.</p>
