      <p>The Ashanti regional Chairman of the New Patriotic Party is cautioning the leadership of the National Democratic Congress to stop throwing dust in the eyes of the public when they talk about the state of the economy they handed over to the current administration.<br/><br/>In an interview with Peacefmonline.com, Mr. Antwi-Boasiako popularly known as Chairman Wontumi stated that "the NDC is full of men who have become talkatives. <br/><br/>They are politically impotent and lack the requisite skills to implement creative flagship policies like the Akufo-Addo administration is doing".<br/><br/>Mr. Bernard Antwi-Boasiako's statement comes on the back of an address by former Deputy Finance Minister, Fifi Fiavi Kwetey that President Akufo-Addo's government inherited a strong economy from the NDC. <br/><br/>According to Mr. Kwetey, his party left the current NPP government with two main oil fields yet it claims it inherited a weak economy. <br/><br/>Responding to the 2020 budget statement and economic policy presented to Parliament by Finance Minister, Ken Ofori Atta, on 13th November 2019, Mr Kwetey said : “The government that has had the most solid economic legacy is the Nana Akufo-Addo government so for them to actually claim that they have inherited the greatest crisis is really a big surprise.” <br/><br/>He continued that “it is only an irresponsible, incompetent, lazy group of people who will blame their predecessors. We (Ghana) would have been in the high heavens if we in the NDC inherited these legacies.”<br/><br/>But Chairman Wontumi insisted that the current administration inherited a "dirty and bad" economy from the erstwhile John Dramani Mahama administration and is fixing it. <br/><br/>He explained that Ghana's economy has witnessed a positive turnaround eversince the Akufo-Addo led government took over from the NDC.<br/><br/>The Ashanti regional Chairman added that the NPP government will continue to take deliberate and strategic steps to accelerate the nation’s economic transformation.<br/><br/>Reiterating the words of the current Finance minister, Chairman Wontumi noted that the goal, which was consistent with the medium-term aspirations of the Ghana Beyond Aid Programme, is to use resources creatively and efficiently to build “a prosperous and self-confident Ghana that is in charge of her economic destiny.”<br/>Featured Video</p>
