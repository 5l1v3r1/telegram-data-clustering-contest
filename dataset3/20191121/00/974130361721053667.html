      <h1>A Star Is Born: 20-Year-Old Creates History Against NBA Heavyweights</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Aonghus Ó Maicín</a></address>
      <p>Slovenian tyro Luka Doncic starred for the Dallas Mavericks last night as the franchise beat NBA heavyweights, the Golden State Warriors, by 48 points, handing them their heaviest defeat since 1973.</p>
      <p>In doing so, the 20-year-old became the first player to record a 35-point triple-double in under 25 minutes, as well as becoming the youngest player to register consecutive 35-point triple-doubles.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, although the Warriors contested last year's NBA finals and have won three of the last five championships, they boast the worst record in the league having won only three games to date this season.</p>
      <p>Doncic may have just proved he is something very special however. Prior to last night, Oscar Robertson was the youngest person to register consecutive 34-point triple-doubles in 1960. Two seasons later he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of a season.</p>

      <p>Already last year's Rookie of the Year is being touted by many as a possible MVP candidate after only 14 games of the regular season.</p>
      <p>Late night games make it difficult for audiences on this side of the Atlantic to tune into NBA games, but Sunday offers an ideal chance for those hoping to catch a glimpse of the prodigy. Doncic and his Maverick teammates will be travelling to Houston to play state rivals, the Rockets, where the young European will come up against former MVPs James Harden and Russell Westbrook.</p>
