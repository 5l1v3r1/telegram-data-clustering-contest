      <p>Connection Telecom offers South African businesses an excellent <a href="https://cloudvideoconferencing.co.za/?utm_source=BusinessTech"><b>video conferencing service</b></a> at an affordable price.</p>
      <p>Video conferencing has many advantages for a business, including improved collaboration between teams and saving on travel costs for meetings.</p>
      <p>It is a powerful tool which can improve productivity and is a must-have for businesses with offices in more than one location.</p>
      <p>While there are many free video conferencing tools, poor service levels can make the experience unpleasant and unproductive.</p>
      <p>This is why Connection Telecom built its Cloud Video Conferencing solutions, which guarantee uptime, eliminate latency spikes, and ensure excellent video quality.</p>
      <h3>Vidyo technology</h3>
      <p><a href="https://cloudvideoconferencing.co.za/?utm_source=BusinessTech"><b>Connection Telecom’s video conferencing solution</b></a> uses Vidyo’s world-leading technology and Connection Telecom’s cloud infrastructure hosted at Teraco.</p>
      <p>Vidyo technology is end-point aware and understands the impact of network speed, screen resolution, and CPU load on the service.</p>
      <p>The technology also actively optimises the video stream for each device to produce the best possible experience, and it is also completely platform agnostic.</p>
      <p>This means it supports virtually any device with a camera and Internet connection.</p>
      <h3>Quick and affordable</h3>
      <p>What makes Connection Telecom’s video conferencing solution particularly attractive to businesses is its cost-effective scalability.</p>
      <p>It is quick and affordable to increase or decrease capacity based on the demands of the business.</p>
      <p>A video conference can be set up in moments and accepting meeting requests can be done via email.</p>
      <p>Additionally, by hosting the service in Connection Telecom’s cloud the turnaround time is almost instantaneous – and reduces costs.</p>
