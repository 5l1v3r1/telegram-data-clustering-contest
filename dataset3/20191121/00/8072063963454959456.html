      <p><b>(NEW YORK POST) –</b> Prince Andrew didn’t step down from royal duties — he was fired by his mom, Queen Elizabeth II, according to reports in the UK.</p>
      <p>“The Queen summoned the Duke to Buckingham Palace to tell him her decision,” one of Andrew’s friends told The Sun of the Duke of York’s downfall that royal experts have called “monumental.”</p>
      <p>“It was a devastating moment for both of them. His reputation is in tatters,” the source said, referring to the overwhelming backlash to his BBC interview discussing his ties to pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>“It is unlikely he will ever perform royal duties again. He is disgraced,” the source told the paper.</p>
      <p>The Queen, 93, made her decision to fire her “favorite son” Wednesday after heavy pressure from her other eldest son, Prince Charles, who also had crisis talks with his scandal-hit brother, several UK papers stated.</p>
      <p>“Charles was very involved in the decision as heir to the throne,” a senior Palace source told The Sun of the royal currently in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>“He knew action had to be taken. The Duke knew he couldn’t fight any more. His royal career is over.”</p>
      <p>The source also admitted that the Queen was “privately very disappointed” with Andrew, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>“She has spent her whole life protecting the monarchy and in just one week her son’s actions threatened to tear it apart,” the source said.</p>
      <p>“Something had to be done to draw a line under all of this.”</p>
      <p>Andrew will no longer receive his $323,000 Sovereign Grant allowance but will still receive his income from the Queen’s private funds, the paper noted.</p>
      <p>However, sources stressed that Andrew “remains a member of the Royal Family” even though he will not carry out public duties.</p>
      <p>“He will still appear during Trooping the Color and on the balcony at major events,” a source told the paper.</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Robert Lacey told The Times of London that it was a “monumental” moment in royal history.</p>
      <p>“Nothing like this has happened in the Queen’s long reign,” he said.</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor also believes the Queen must be “horrified.”</p>
      <p>“This is absolutely unprecedented that a fairly senior member of the Royal Family should be forced to retire from public life,” she told The Sun.</p>
