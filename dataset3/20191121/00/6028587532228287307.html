      <h1>2019 Land Rover Range Rover Sport HST MHEV Review: 6 Things You Need To Know</h1>

      <p>The Range Rover Sport has been a staple of the Land Rover brand since it was introduced in 2005. Over the years as the brand has expanded, the Sport has taken its place as the second in command over the lineup, outdone only by the original Range Rover model itself. The Sport boasts sleek styling, tremendous off-road capabilities and plenty of convenience features to keep you happy.</p>

        <b>Explaining HST PHEV</b>
      </p>
      <p>As emissions regulations tighten across the world, vehicle manufacturers are looking to electrification and hybrid technology to meet strict new demands, and Range Rover is no exception, having introduced a new mild-hybrid system on this model of the Sport.  </p>
      <figure>

      <p>It features a 3.0L inline 6-cylinder paired with a 48-volt hybrid-electric system. That's good for 395 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque.  The HST model is the most powerful in the Range Rover Sport MHEV segment, while the SE and HSE offer 355 horsepower instead of 395. </p>

      <p>The HST model gets this incredibly heavy Range Rover Sport from 0 to 60 in just 5.9 seconds. What makes that even more impressive was that, during my test drive regime, I was able to achieve an average of 23 MPG in combined highway and city driving.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Performance Is Key</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was very impressed with the handling dynamics of this large SUV, and my body remained firm and planted in the seat even when accelerating briskly along freeway entrance ramps.  The Sport is also quick to respond off the line, thanks in part to its electric supercharger that can spool in just 0.5 seconds and reach up to 120,000 RPMs, increasing boost and reducing turbo lag. The 48-volt system also helps the stop-start system to achieve a smooth refined feeling, something that was lacking in the past. </p>

      <p>The mild-hybrid system idea as a whole is excellent but Land Rover needs to improve overall integration between the electric power and the engine to ensure smooth power delivery. </p>

        <b>Dazzling Interior Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>Range Rover's new interior design platform is incredible and works very well on the Range Rover Sport. My test car was equipped with a stunning Alcantara steering wheel, door panels, and headliner while the rest of the vehicle was treated to carbon fiber trim and red leather. This combination is a showstopper and while it's a bit intense, I would recommend it. However, if you're looking for something a bit more relaxed, you're still able to choose from many different interior combinations which are less bold but no less stylish. </p>

      <p>I loved every moment inside the Sport, it's the quality and design which would allow me to overlook some of Range Rover's flaws. If style is at the top of your list then Range Rover should be too. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Lot's of Tech But...</b>
      </p>
      <p>As you would expect from an optioned-up $105,000 SUV, The Sport boasts tons of tech, from distance guided cruise control to a heads-up-display to very accurate lane keep assist.  However, Land Rover still can't seem to make a backup camera without significant lag. Drivers should know that they could easily back up into something if not taking it incredibly slow. This is a major issue and has been present on every Range Rover I've ever tested. </p>

        <b>HST Exterior Treatment </b>
      </p>
      <p>The HST line is focused on performance and that shows on the exterior with large carbon fiber accent panels, red disc-brake calipers, black wheels, black roof and Range Rover lettering in black. It's how you say “I've arrived” as noticeably as possible. </p>

      <p>If you are looking for an SUV which stands out, then I would strongly suggest the HST Range Rover Sport. I love the look, especially with the red calipers, black roof, and 21" black wheels from the HST package.</p>

        <b>Final Thoughts</b>
      </p>
      <p>Personally, if I were to purchase a Range Rover, I'd still go for the Supercharged 5.0 V-8 over the MHEV HST. But if efficiency is key on your next large SUV purchase, then it could make sense. Just keep in mind, you're not going to experience the smoothest of driving experiences, especially around town at low speeds. The Sport does excel when it comes to interior quality and exterior design, but those come at a price, not only in actual cost but also in Land Rover quirks like an incredibly laggy backup camera, painful to program navigation system, and an overall slow to respond multi-media system.  Like they say, looking good is never easy. For many divers, the quality it worth making the sacrifice, but for those of you looking for something a bit more user-friendly, I'd take a close look at the BMW X5, Audi Q7, and Mercedes-Benz GLC.</p>
