      <p>Star Wars has never been bigger or broader, and in the game industry few Star Wars games have had a greater impact than <i>Star Wars Galaxies</i>. This influential MMORPG entered development two decades ago, and now two of its leading creators are coming to <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-21-gdc20">GDC 2020</a> to tell the story of how it rose and fell.</p>
      <p>Together, Playable Worlds chief Raph Koster and Certain Affinity VP Rich Vogel will be presenting a <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/classic-game-postmortem-star-wars-galaxies/872246?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-21-gdc20"><i>Star Wars Galaxies </i>Classic Game Postmortem</a> that promises to reveal key lessons learned and practical advice about large-scale social design aimed at building a strong community for games as a service.</p>
      <p>This is likely to be a great talk for anyone with an interest in online game design or good stories, as <i>Galaxies </i>had a famously troubled existence, with a patch so controversial it made the New York Times. <i>Star Wars Galaxies</i> went from an MIT case study in how best to manage a community, to a byword for how to damage a customer relationship; and yet to this day the game industry echoes with talk about its crafting systems, social design, and procedural technology.</p>
      <p>In this hour-long postmortem, Koster and Vogel aim to talk about the ways in which the game reached for the stars, from the nitty-gritty of its player-driven economy design, to the dancing Wookiees -- and also the wars it left behind. Don't miss it!</p>
