      <p>The new <b>Toyota RAV4 plug-in hybrid</b> – the most <b>powerful</b> and <b>quickest</b> RAV4 to date – will go on sale in the US by the middle of next year, but Australian customers will need to wait a little longer.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/">Toyota</a> is the clear market leader for regular petrol-electric hybrid cars – which charge their onboard battery pack during normal driving, but only offer a limited electric boost – the company is yet to introduce a plug-in hybrid locally despite the technology being available overseas.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have anything to announce on the introduction of (plug-in hybrids) to Australia today,” said a statement from Toyota. “We’re not ruling it out, and are studying the possibility of introducing (the technology) in the future.”</p>

      <p>The new <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/toyota/rav4/">Toyota RAV4</a> plug-in hybrid could be worth the wait, whether you want to save the planet or floor the throttle.</p>
      <p>Toyota says the RAV4 plug-in hybrid can travel up to 62km on battery power alone in real-world driving conditions before switching to petrol. The company claims it is the longest electric driving range of any plug-in hybrid SUV on sale today.</p>
      <p>As with the regular Toyota RAV4 Hybrid range, a 2.5-litre petrol engine powers the front wheels while an electric motor delivers extra power to the rear wheels on demand.</p>

      <p>However, compared to the regular Toyota RAV4 Hybrid, the plug-in hybrid variant has a bigger, lithium-ion battery pack and a more powerful electric motor.</p>
      <p>This combination enables the Toyota RAV4 Prime, as it is called in the US, to sprint from 0 to 100km/h in about 6 seconds, about two seconds quicker than the normal RAV4 Hybrid.</p>
      <p>For comparison, the hugely popular Toyota RAV4 V6 sold from 2006 to 2012 did the 0 to 100km/h dash in about 6.5 seconds.</p>
      <p>That 3.5-litre V6 had 200kW of power; Toyota says the RAV4 plug-in hybrid has a total of 225kW of power from its petrol and electric motors.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, Toyota Australia says it is working overtime to clear a backlog of orders for the regular RAV4 Hybrid.</p>
      <p>The delivery time on some variants stretches to four months, however some customers claim they are being told the wait could be up to 12 to 14 months.</p>
      <p><i>CarAdvice</i> has asked Toyota Australia for a more accurate estimate on the expected delivery times across all in-demand hybrid models including Corolla, Camry and RAV4, so customers are not misinformed at the dealership when shopping for a new car.</p>
