      <h1>Gmail app adds AMP for Email support for Android and iOS</h1>
      <h2>Brands will be able to deliver emails with dynamic content such as RSVPing to events within the Gmail app.</h2>

      <p>Google has announced that the Gmail app for Android and iOS will be rolling out <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/dynamic-mail-android-ios.html">support</a> for AMP for Email, the dynamic content feature that allows users to interact directly within emails. The update is available to all G Suite editions and will be set to “on” by default. Users viewing emails through a third-party app will receive a static version of the email.</p>
      <h3>Why we should care</h3>
      <p>Serving dynamic emails allows marketers to extend the lifetime of their brands’ emails. Marketers who take advantage of AMP for Email can keep their customers up-to-date without sending redundant emails by including dynamic content like the status of an e-commerce order. It also allows recipients to take actions such as unsubscribing without having to leave the body of the email.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Google announced that it would be adding support for dynamic emails in <a href="https://marketingland.com/dynamic-amp-for-email-is-rolling-out-in-gmail-now-258927">Gmail on the web</a>.  With the Gmail app now supporting dynamic content, marketers have the opportunity to deliver engaging mobile experiences that don’t require the recipient to open another app or browser.</p>
