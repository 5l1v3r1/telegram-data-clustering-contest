      <h1>Swiss Private Placement Life Insurance Policy (PPLI) Results In Conviction Of Blandi For Tax Evasion</h1>

      <p>According to a press release from the U.S. Department of Justice, Mr. John Thomas Blandi of Spokane, Washington, has plead guilty to filing a false tax return in connection with an offshore private placement life insurance policy (PPLI) in which he held over $5.2 million in assets and failed to report $1.43 million in income.The press release states that Blandi funded a PPLI policy through a company in Switzerland, which basically provided little more than an "insurance wrapper" to conceal Blandi's offshore account and income. Although the PPLI policy made it facially appear like Blandi simply owned a life insurance policy, in fact he maintained investment control over the policy's assets and directed investments. When it came time to file his tax returns, Blandi did not disclose the existence of the offshore account nor did he report the investment income earned on the policy's assets.</p>
      <p>Blandi, who at the time of the press release was age 74, is looking at a maximum of three years at Club Fed, plus restitution for the U.S. government's tax law and probably very hefty penalties.</p>
      <p>Private Placement Life Insurance is one of the most abused financial vehicles when it comes to outright tax evasion or grey-area "avoision" of tax. Not all PPLI policies are illegal or abusive, but many are. Suffice it to say that PPLI is a very dangerous product, and folks who decide to use them for whatever reason should at the very least get an independent second opinion from a tax professional who is experienced in that area of the law before they pull the trigger.</p>
      <p>Domestic PPLI policies that are disclosed to the IRS are generally safe. The taxpayer and the IRS may squabble later about whether the policy works or not, but at least there is no risk of an indictment.</p>
      <p>By contrast, offshore PPLI policies that are not disclosed to the IRS is dousing oneself with gasoline and then playing with matches. This is true despite the promises from offshore advisors that "the IRS will never find out" or outright false statements that these products have been approved by the IRS (the IRS does no such thing). Here, Blandi did not think the IRS would catch him, but now he is a convicted felon with a future check-in date at Club Fed.</p>
      <p>As with so many aggressive tax strategies, the usual cure is to get an independent second opinion from an experienced tax professional (and not one recommended by the promoter as those tend to be shills). If nothing else, if the policy hits the fan, at least the taxpayer can attempt to asset a reliance defense to avoid conviction.</p>
      <p>Probably the better policy is just to realize that offshore PPLI is utterly toxic and avoid it altogether.</p>
