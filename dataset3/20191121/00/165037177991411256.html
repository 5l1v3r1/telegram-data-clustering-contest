        <b>Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid will have to decide whether to select Bale for the match against Real Sociedad. The Welshman has overstepped the mark, but the club do not want the issue to get out of hand.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zidane has to make the most important decision about Bale up to now. After having played for Wales, <b>he has the all clear</b>, but there are a range of opinions over whether to select him. </p>
      <p>Calling him to play against Real Sociedad this Saturday could be bad for the rest of the squad. It would give the impression that a player <b>who is not motivated can triumph at the Bernabeu</b>. </p>
      <p>In addition, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Bale</a> <b>could receive a very bad reception from the Bernabeu faithful</b> if he plays. Real Madrid's idea is to clam the nerves, avoid things getting out of hand with one of the best paid players in the squad (<b>14.5 million euros net</b>, the same as Ramos). </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-bale-72/">Man Utd</a> are <b>continuing to reach an agreement for a Bale-Pogba swap</b>. Nevertheless, neither the player, nor his agent who has spoken to 'AS', are thinking of leaving this winter. But they are in summer: "<b>Who knows</b>," his agent, Jonathan Barnett points out. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, <b>leaving him out of the squad </b>would not help to normalise the situation. On the contrary,<b> it would open a little bit more</b>, the gap and the obligation for the club to depart as soon as possible. </p>
      <p>What seems clear is that Bale is going to pay for his joke towards <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/real-madrid">Real Madrid</a>. Unless that flag with "<b>Wales, Golf, Madrid, in that order</b>" is a way of putting pressure on the Spanish side. </p>
