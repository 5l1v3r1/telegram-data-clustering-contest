      <h1>Dracula’s Famed Familiar Renfield Is Getting His Own Movie, and Honestly He’s Earned It</h1>

      <p>R.M. Renfield had the thankless job of being Dracula’s errand boy who everyone wrote off as crazy, but now he is going to be a star. <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dexter-fletcher-dracula-henchman-renfield-robert-kirkman-1203410649/"><i>Variety</i></a><i> </i>reports that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/rocketman-2019-review-oh-no-no-no.html"><i>Rocketman</i></a> director Dexter Fletcher will helm a new movie for Universal called <i>Renfield</i> that will center on the Count’s familiar, and the script is being handled by <i>Rick and Morty </i>writer Ryan Ridley. As <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/dexter-fletcher-dracula-henchman-renfield-robert-kirkman-1203410649/"><i>Variety</i></a><i> </i>says, “Universal had <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/06/the-mummy-could-kill-universals-dark-universe-or-save-it.html">originally planned</a> on creating an interconnected universe with its vast catalog of monster IP. However, the studio reassessed, and decided to move forward with filmmaker-driven projects based on the monsters’ legacies, focusing on what made the characters endure over time. Instead of prescribing a mandate that the films be part of a larger scheme, Universal loosened those restrictions and open-sourced to filmmakers to create their own unique stories.” In other words, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/11/universal-has-reportedly-given-up-on-its-monsterverse.html">RIP Dark Universe</a>! Blumhouse’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-invisible-man-trailer-elisabeth-moss.html"><i>The Invisible Man</i></a><i> </i>is part of this pared-down Universal Monsters drive, and while plot specifics for Fletcher’s <i>Renfield</i> are not being shared yet, it’s said to take place in the present day. Let your light shine, Renfield!</p>
