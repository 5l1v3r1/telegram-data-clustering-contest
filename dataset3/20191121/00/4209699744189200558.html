      <p>The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has filed fresh charges against James Nolan, a Briton, at the Federal High Court, Abuja.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, EFCC’s Counsel, Ekele Iheanacho, had at the resumed trial, told Justice Okon Abang that the anti-graft agency had filed an amended charge dated November 20, according to the News Agency of Nigeria.</p>
      <p>The lawyer said the EFCC was now bringing up a 32-count charge against the defendants in the case contrary to the initial 16-count charge bordering on money laundering.</p>
      <p>The EFCC had on October 21 arraigned Mr Nolan and Adam Quinn (at large), both British nationals, over their alleged complicity in the $9.6bn judgment against Nigeria.</p>
      <p>Process and Industrial Development, an Irish engineering company, had secured the award against Nigeria following the non-execution of a 20-year gas and supply processing agreement the company had with the federal government.</p>
      <p>The arraignment of the two British nationals comes weeks after two P&amp;ID directors were convicted over the deal.</p>
      <p>The defendants are both directors of Goidel Resources Limited, a Designated Non-Financial Institution and ICIL Limited.</p>
