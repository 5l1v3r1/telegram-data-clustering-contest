      <p>Deputy General Secretary of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), Nana Obiri Boahen has said that former EC boss Madam Charlotte Osei should be facing trial for financial misappropriation.</p>
      <p>He says her two other deputies; Amadu Sulley and Georgina Opoku Amankwah must also be trialled.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Okay FM's 'Ade Akye Abia' programme, he explained that a financial report has indicted them for financial misappropriation.</p>
      <p>He expressed worry about why his party has even delayed initiating prosecution against them.</p>
      <p>"But I believe that very soon the government will begin prosecution," he said.</p>
      <p>"It is not that we want to witch-hunt them but I believe that if they are prosecuted, it will serve as a deterrent to others," he added.</p>
      <p>He however, asked the National Democratic Congress (NDC) to stay away from accusing the Electoral Commission's Chairperson, Madam Jean Mensa and one of her deputies, Dr. Bssman Asare wrongly.</p>
      <p>"They are independent-minded people doing their work," he stated.</p>
