      <p>If the early bird always gets the worm, the early wine always gets the attention of American wine lovers. The third Thursday of November is always Nouveau Day – more specifically, Beaujolais Nouveau Day, when wine shops around the world proclaim the arrival of the young Beaujolais wines, which are not allowed to be sold before this date. But in the past five to ten years, American winemakers have decided to get in on the Nouveau Day fun as well, making nouveau-style wines using a myriad of vinification techniques and grape varieties. This Nouveau Day, embrace the new nouveau with wines from both France and the U.S.</p>
      <p>Nouveau wines <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/courtneyschiessl/2018/11/15/in-defense-of-beaujolais-nouveau/#7ef42bc46939">often get a bad rap</a>. As the name suggests, these are the new wines from the most recent harvest, bottled and sold after anywhere from three weeks to three months after grapes are plucked from the vine. Beaujolais Nouveau, made from the Gamay grape and typically vinified using whole-cluster carbonic maceration, has brought the concept to the general public, but nouveau wines actually stem from the French tradition of <i>vins primeurs</i>, or early wines, which were popped and poured at local festivals to celebrate the recent harvest.</p>
      <p>Beginning in the 1950s, Beaujolais winemakers would host parties around November 15 (which was, at that time, the legal Beaujolais Nouveau release date) to celebrate the release of the new wines. Soon, Beaujolais Nouveau <i>fêtes</i> spread beyond the region’s borders, even including races to see who could be the first to deliver the newly released bottles to Parisian wine shops. By the 1970s, Beaujolais Nouveau Day was well-known in France, and in 1982, the prominent négociant <a href="http://www.duboeuf.com/">Georges Duboeuf</a> brought the celebrations to the U.S. Shortly thereafter, Beaujolais Nouveau’s legally mandated release was shifted to the third Thursday in November, thus cementing it as a Thanksgiving tradition in the U.S.</p>
      <p>But as other Beaujolais wines, particularly cru Beaujolais, have become more popular among sommeliers and wine insiders, many oenophiles have shoved Beaujolais Nouveau aside, claiming that these young wines undercut the region’s reputation; because vinification is fast, with no time for aging, the wines tend to be light and simple. Ironically, over that same period of time, small American producers have embraced the concept of nouveau-style wines. Some, like <a href="https://www.divisionwineco.com/">Division Wine Co.</a> and <a href="http://bowandarrowwines.com/">Bow &amp; Arrow</a>, have fully mimicked the Beaujolais Nouveau style, working with Gamay grapes and using carbonic maceration to make Beaujolais Nouveau-like wines. Others have branched out, using traditional vinification techniques or experimenting with other grape varieties.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the most ironic twist of all is that while Beaujolais Nouveau is mostly associated with commercial production – Georges Duboeuf, the face of Beaujolais Nouveau, is the region’s largest producer – those who have adopted nouveau-style winemaking stateside are some of the United States’ most beloved, innovative, artisanal winemakers, such as <a href="https://marthastoumen.com/">Martha Stoumen</a> and <a href="http://www.crusewineco.com/">Cruse Wine Co</a>. Why? Because nouveau-style wines are meant to be uncomplicated, fun, and easy-drinking – just the kind of juice you want for convivial gatherings of friends and family.</p>
      <p>As nouveau wines evolve – in both French and U.S. vineyards – branch out this Nouveau Day by embracing wines from both sides of the Atlantic. In fact, it might even be easier to find American nouveau wines than some Beaujolais Nouveaus; because these bottles are often made in relatively limited quantities and sold quickly, most French versions don’t make their way to the U.S.</p>
      <p>While some nouveau producers only sell their wines locally, here are some of the best Beaujolais Nouveau and American nouveau wines that you can actually find and drink this Nouveau Day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Beaujolais Nouveau</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/george+duboeuf+beaujolais+nouveau+france/2019"><b>Georges Duboeuf Beaujolais Nouveau 2019</b></a>, Beaujolais, France ($12)</p>
      <p>The classic – and probably most widely-available – Beaujolais Nouveau, this year’s vintage has plenty of plummy, peppy fruit. Duboeuf also makes a <a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/george+duboeuf+village+nouveau+beaujolais+france/2019">Beaujolais-Villages Nouveau</a>, which has even more structure and depth.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/george+duboeuf+rose+beaujolais+nouveau+france/2019"><b>Georges Duboeuf Beaujolais Nouveau Rosé 2019</b></a>, Beaujolais, France ($12)</p>
      <p>Last year, Duboeuf released the first-ever Beaujolais Nouveau rosé; the second iteration is dry, fresh, and acid-driven, with bright citrus flavors.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/jean+paul+brun+dom+de+terre+doree+l+ancien+beaujolais+nouveau+france/1/usa"><b>Domaine des Terres Dorées ‘L’Ancien’ Beaujolais Nouveau 2019</b></a>, Beaujolais, France ($15)</p>
      <p>Jean-Paul Brun makes his Beaujolais Nouveau from the earliest harvest of his organically-farmed old vines in southern Beaujolais. He eschews the carbonic maceration that is largely standard for Beaujolais Nouveau in favor of classic vinification with a low-intervention philosophy, which is why the L’Ancien Nouveau is often a favorite of sommeliers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/dupeuble+pere+beaujolais+nouveau+france"><b>Domaine Dupueble Père et Fils Beaujolais Nouveau 2019</b></a>, Beaujolais, France ($16)</p>
      <p>Another low-intervention, southern Beaujolais producer with a natural bent, Domaine Dupueble uses a quick carbonic maceration to create this juicy, easy-drinking wine.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/dom+jean+foillard+beaujolais+nouveau+france"><b>Domaine Jean Foillard Beaujolais Nouveau 2019</b></a>, Beaujolais, France ($15)</p>
      <p>Based in Villié-Morgon, Jean Foillard is one of the “Gang of Four” vignerons to bring back Beaujolais’ traditional methods of viticulture and vinification, with little to no sulfur dioxide added, but interestingly enough, he also makes a delicious and sought-after Beaujolais Nouveau.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>American Nouveau</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.divisionwineco.com/product/2019-Nouveau"><b>Division Wine Co. ‘Nouveau Nouveau’ 2019</b></a>, Columbia Valley, Washington ($19)</p>
      <p>One of the first producers to make an American nouveau, Portland, Oregon-based Division Wine Co. vinifies Gamay grapes using carbonic maceration to make this easy, tasty wine. Their recommendation: drink it with a light chill.</p>
      <p><a href="https://marthastoumen.vinespring.site/#/purchase/item/prod_5db9d09abbc50b0001682d69"><b>Martha Stoumen Patatino Nouveau 2019</b></a>, California ($30)</p>
      <p>A breakout star of small-production, natural California winemaking, Martha Stoumen released her first nouveau wine this year – the same year that she welcomed her first child. (A baby wine to celebrate a new baby? How fitting!) It’s a blend of Nero d’Avola, Zinfandel, and Valdiguie, with a portion of the Nero d’Avola vinified using carbonic maceration.</p>
      <p><a href="https://macariwines.com/wine/2019-early-wine/"><b>Macari Vineyards ‘Early Wine’ Chardonnay 2019</b></a>, Long Island, New York ($24)</p>
      <p>Red wines are the only ones to have all the nouveau fun! On Long Island’s North Fork, Macari Vineyards picks Chardonnay grapes early to make a refreshing, young white wine, inspired by Austria’s tradition of “Jungwein.”</p>
      <p><a href="http://store.scribewinery.com/product/2019-Nouveau-of-Pinot-Noir?productListName=Cellar&amp;position=7"><b>Scribe Nouveau of Pinot Noir 2019</b></a>, Carneros, California ($32)</p>
      <p>Sonoma-based Scribe Winery opts for Pinot Noir instead of Gamay for their carbonic nouveau, which was bottled at the end of October. A bonus to buying this bottle: a portion of the Nouveau of Pinot Noir proceeds will go to Corazón Healdsburg to support Kincade Fire relief efforts.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/cruse+co+valdiguie+nouveau+suisun+valley+solano+county+north+coast+california+usa"><b>Cruse Wine Co. Valdiguie Nouveau 2019</b></a>, California ($27)</p>
      <p>Considering that Valdiguie was once mistakenly called “Napa Gamay,” this nouveau version from Cruse Wine Co. is a cheeky twist on Beaujolais Nouveau. This virbant wine is vinified using carbonic maceration.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.donkeyandgoat.com/shop/detail?item=19-new-glou"><b>Donkey &amp; Goat New Glou 2019</b></a>, California ($24)</p>
      <p>Don’t get hung up on the grape varieties in this blend (Marsanne and Mourvèdre and Grenache, oh my!) because there’s a whole lot thrown into this juicy, super-drinkable, nouveau-style wine. If you buy now, there’s still time to get it in time for Thanksgiving celebrations!</p>
