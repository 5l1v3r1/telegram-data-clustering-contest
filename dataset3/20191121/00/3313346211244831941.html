      <p>CD Projekt cites licensing royalties from “continuing strong sales” of <i>The Witcher 3</i>, its expansion packs, and spin-offs like <i>Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales </i>and in-game <i>Gwent</i> sales as the driving forces behind its 38 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for Q3 of the 2019-20 fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The group as a whole, including CD Projekt Red, GOG, and other subsidiaries, reported 92.9 million PLN (~$23.9 million) in revenue for the quarter ending September 30.</p>
      <p>That makes for a 25.7 million PLN (~$6.6 million) increase year-over-year that was, in addition to everything named above, also aided by GOG revenue, and “sales of components of physical editions” of games to distributors like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> collector’s editions and <i>The Witcher 3</i> for Switch ahead of release. Net profit, meanwhile, came in at 14.9 million PLN (~$3.8 million)for the quarter, down from 15.5 million PLN (~$4 million) last year.</p>
      <p>Looking just at the game development segment CD Projekt Red, the company reported sales revenue of 63.2 million PLN (~$16.3 million) for the quarter, up from 40.9 million PLN (~$10.5 million), and net profit of 16.8 million PLN (~$4.3 million), up from 16.1 million PLN (~$4.1 million).</p>
      <p>GOG, CD Projekt’s online game store and platform, meanwhile reported sales revenue of 31.5 million PLN (~$8.1 million), up from last year’s 28.1 million PLN (~$7.2 million), and a net loss of 1.9 million PLN (~$490,284) for the quarter, up from Q3 2018’s 561,000 PLN (~$144,383) loss.</p>
