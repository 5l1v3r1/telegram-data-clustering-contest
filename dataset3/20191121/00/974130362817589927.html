      <h1>7 Fantasy Premier League Tips For Gameweek 13</h1>

      <p>After the void that was the international break, Premier League football is back on the agenda this weekend. That also means the return of fantasy football, and we have some Fantasy Premier League tips for gameweek 13.</p>
      <h3>Fantasy Premier League Tips</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Nick Pope (Burnley) - £4.7m</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Burnley went on a sticky spell at the back for a few weeks, they still have what is quite a solid defence. That should be enough to see them through this weekend's visit to Watford, who boast the worst goalscoring record in the division.</p>
      <p>Nick Pope should benefit from that, making that price tag look like a potential bargain.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal) - £11.0m</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite Arsenal's disappointing campaign, Aubameyang continues to score goals for fun. Southampton at home will offer him the opportunity to continue that run, with the visitors' troubles at the back well documented.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Frédéric Guilbert (Aston Villa) - £4.4m</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even though Newcastle have been in good form as of late you would expect that to come to an end soon. Aston Villa have played well in the last few weeks, even if they don't have the results to show for it.</p>
      <p>Guilbert has started the last ten Premier League games, and with the home side a good bet to keep a clean sheet, he would be a solid addition to your squad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Richarlison (Everton) - £7.9m</b>
      </p>
      <p>Norwich ship plenty of goals, and while Everton have their own struggles at the moment, you would fancy them to bag a couple at Goodison Park on Saturday afternoon. Richarlison has not been in great from up to this point in the campaign but he did find the net against Southampton last week.</p>
      <p>This will probably only be a one week rental, however, considering Everton's disastrous run of fixtures on the horizon.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City) - £10.2m</b>
      </p>
      <p>Manchester City currently sit in fourth place, one spot behind Saturday's opponents Chelsea. Lampard's side have eased their defensive issues but their midfield could be a problem in this fixture.</p>
      <p>That makes De Bruyne an attractive prospect, with the Belgian having nine assists in the league to his name already this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Heung-Min Son (Spurs) - £9.6m</b>
      </p>
      <p>You just know that we will see that new manager bounce for Spurs this weekend. The fact that West Ham will be in opposition is a huge help, with Pellegrini's side conceding 13 goals in their last six games.</p>
      <p>We should see a few goals in this one.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain (Liverpool) - £6.2m</b>
      </p>
      <p>Is it time Oxlade-Chamberlain is finally given a Premier League opportunity for Liverpool? This weekend seems like the perfect time to do so, with his direct style suited to playing against a Crystal Palace team who will defend very deeply.</p>
      <p>His goalscoring exploits for England provided another example of the form he is in, so now could be the time to get him into your team.</p>
