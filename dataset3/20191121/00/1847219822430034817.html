        <b>Bio-economy is one of the main strategic directions for Latvia and the National Development Plan for 2021-2027 (NAP2027) needs to have a section dedicated to bio-economy. It needs to detail a specific vision for necessary innovations, labour force resource and capital attraction.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This much was stressed by members of Saeima’s Sustainable Development Committee at a meeting on Wednesday, 20 November.</p>
      <p>Without a doubt, use of biological resources for food and energy production will remain topical for Latvia. This is why it is necessary to discuss appropriate solutions for this industry, not abstract average companies, said the committee’s chairman Vjačeslavs Dombrovskis, adding that bio-economy should be viewed in the context with the plan’s priority regarding competitiveness and material welfare of companies.</p>
      <p>During the discussion of the main goals of the bio-economy industry’s main goals in the context of NAP2027, Agriculture Ministry’s representatives said there isn’t a single objective in the plan that details human health from the perspective of food circulation.</p>
      <p>Members of the committee proposed expanding NAP2027 and clearly outline the objective to enhance public health, ensure circulation of quality food and set higher standards for animal health.</p>
      <p>Additionally, members of the committee also invited putting more emphasis in the next planning period on processing of agricultural products and support for companies that do this. «Historically support has focused on grain and livestock farming. Members of the committee propose switching to processing agriculture products so that it is possible to create more of such strong companies like <i>Latraps</i>, <i>Latvijas Finieris</i> and <i>Food Union</i>,» stresses Dombrovskis.</p>
      <p>He also says the committee will continue working on NAP2027 and adding priorities all the way until the plan has been submitted to the Saeima.</p>
