      <p>MP for Ketu South Constituency, Fifi Kwetey, has lamented at the New Patriotic Party’s resolve to push for universal electricity coverage to all by 2030.</p>
      <p>According to him, the Akufo-Addo led administration in just 4 years has increased electricity coverage by just 0.5 percent.</p>
      <p>“We handed over to them a country that has seen an increase in electricity coverage from 52 percent to 83 percent and in just 4 years, they have been able to only increase electricity coverage by 0.5 percent, not even 1 percent, whereas we [NDC] were on cause to providing universal coverage by the end of 2020”</p>
      <p>“They have come into office today and they had to push the universal electricity coverage to 2030 because they are moving at such a slow pace and there’s no way they will be able to extend electricity coverage like the way we [NDC] were doing,” he remarked.</p>
      <p>Fifi Kwetey said this on Wednesday, November 20 when the NDC held a public forum in reaction to the 2020 Budget and Economic Policy in Accra.</p>
      <p>Fifi Kwetey also indicated that the John Mahama led government had left behind water coverage that moved from a rate of 57 percent to 76 percent yet they [NPP] claim the NDC left an economic mess.</p>
