      <p>Hamburg - For <b>Germany’s largest port</b>, seaborne cargo handling in the first nine months of 2019 proved highly “satisfactory”. The growth trend evident since the beginning of the year “was maintained”, writes the port in a press release. With seaborne cargo throughput up 3.2 percent at 104 million tons, growth in Hamburg clearly exceeded the figures from its major competing ports in Northern Europe. These reported an advance averaging one percent. Container handling at seven million TEU – 20-ft standard containers – was up by 6.9 percent. Here again, Hamburg regained market share up of 0.7 percentage points in competition with other major container ports, whose growth averaged 3.4 percent. The excellent container handling trend in the rail segment also boosted seaport-hinterland services. Transporting 2.1 million TEU in the first nine months, these attained 11.9 percent growth. At 31.6 million tons – down 2.1 percent – bulk cargo throughput was slightly below last year’s.</p>
      <p>The <b>6.9 percent climb in container handling </b>to 7.0 million TEU is attributed to the four new transatlantic services, plus four new Baltic feeder services. Since the beginning of the year, the new transatlantic services operated by Hapag-Lloyd and ONE have connected Hamburg with ports in the USA, Canada and Mexico. In the first three-quarters of the year, 439,000 TEU were handled on container services with the USA, Hamburg’s second most important trading partner. That is 336,000 TEU more than in the same period of the previous year, meaning an advance of 325 percent.</p>
      <p>During the first three quarters of 2019, <b>the Port of Hamburg’s transhipment and hinterland services</b> proved “extremely successful.” Transhipment totals profited from the new container liner services that generated additional volumes for Hamburg’s extensive network of feeder connections. A total of 2.6 million TEU were transhipped in Hamburg from oceangoing vessels to feeders, representing an advance of 4.3 percent. Transporting 4.4 million TEU in the first nine months, landside seaport-hinterland services achieved 8.6 percent growth.</p>
