      <p>CFS crews fought more than 40 fires around the state on Wednesday. Several will continue to burn overnight, including a serious blaze at Yorketown which has destroyed several houses.</p>
      <p>Paramedics treated several Country Fire Service volunteers for smoke inhalation and heat stress as the mercury soared above 40C - ahead of Thursday’s cool change.</p>
      <p>On a record-breaking day of searing temperatures across the state, the CFS fought 45 fires in dangerous conditions. An emergency warning was still in place on Wednesday night for the Yorketown fire, with the St Vincent Highway closed at several junctions.</p>
      <p>CFS warned that the fire had spread south, towards the coast, but was also spreading east and west.</p>
      <p>They anticipated a wind change after midnight would result in the eastern flank becoming the head of the fire, travelling towards Coobowie, Edithburgh and Port Giles.</p>
      <p>While several homes were destroyed by the stubble blaze, the exact number of homes lost will not be known until fire crews have the blaze under control.</p>

      <p>Another fire at Price, which had been contained before jumping lines, was downgraded from an emergency warning to a watch and act message at 8pm.</p>
      <p>Residents in the Yorketown fire danger zone were unable to leave their homes amid warnings that firefighters would be unable to prevent the blazes from spreading.</p>
      <p>Three other fires at Angaston in the Barossa Valley, Beaufort near Port Wakefield and Appila near Jamestown in the state’s Mid North were contained after posing significant threats earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>The fire at Yorketown, which burnt at least 3000ha started only 100m from houses and was fanned by the wind through crops and across paddocks.</p>
      <p>It crossed roads and changed directions multiple times as dozens of CFS volunteers and farmers fought to halt its progress.</p>
      <p>Other homesteads were saved with evidence of the flames all the way up to the front porch of some houses.</p>
      <p>Tractors and utes abandoned in the paddocks continued to burn along with fence posts and hay piles as crews tried to keep up with the firefront.</p>

      <p>Multiple water bombers helped support the effort of crews on the ground. The firefront was eventually driven towards the sea but not before it destroyed hundreds of hectares of crops and paddocks.</p>
      <p>Farm firefighting units from around the region massed to the area to help contain the blaze and assist in the mop up.</p>
      <p>A CFS spokeswoman said there were no confirmed reports of any injuries in any of the fires. The spokeswoman said volunteers would remain on the firegrounds overnight.</p>
      <p>“It was windy out there, which is of concern so it’s pushing fire in one direction and with the wind change (this morning) it will then change the direction of the fire and it can create very dangerous conditions,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Price fire was contained at 3.30pm after burning 165ha. However, the blaze broke containment lines and on Wednesday night remained uncontrolled as it burnt in a southerly direction towards Price, Tiddy Widdy Beach, Ardrossan.</p>

      <p>Ardrossan Area School and Keyneton Primary School enacted its “shelter in place” procedure and liaised with regional fire commanders to ensure students’ safety.</p>
      <p>Parents were advised against collecting their children due to the risk of travel in the bushfire zone. In other major fires, an uncontrolled blaze broke out along the Stott Hwy at Angaston in the Barossa Valley just before 2.30pm.</p>
      <p>The CFS said the fire started in a pile of horse manure at the McEvoy Mitchell Racing’s property, near Angaston, with the fire coming within 50m of the family home.</p>
      <p>Horse trainer and co-owner Calvin McEvoy said the horses were never in danger.</p>
      <p>“Our family house, which is down the bottom (of the property), got quite close to it, luckily it’s all fine,” the 24-year-old said. “The danger was it spreading around the paddock but the CFS has been fantastic and the community, everyone’s got on board and got it under control very quickly.”</p>

      <p>At Beaufort, a piggery caught alight and threatened nearby houses just before 3pm.</p>
      <p>Traffic was banked up on the outskirts of Port Wakefield as police stopped motorists from driving north, with a plume of smoke and dust whipped up by the intense winds reducing visibility.</p>
      <p>SA Power Networks disconnected the Port Lincoln district for safety reasons.</p>
      <p>Some local residents complained on social media and to talkback radio but Port Lincoln Mayor Brad Flaherty said most residents accepted the need to put safety first.</p>
      <p>Power to 6000 customers in Port Lincoln was restored about 8pm but SAPN spokesman said lines radiating from the town had to be patrolled before being switched on, a process that began at 10pm.</p>
      <p>“We have had three reports of wires down in the lower Eyre Peninsula and each of those would have had the real potential to start a fire,” Mr Roberts said. “We only make a decision to disconnect after a series of steps are reached.”</p>
      <p>Mr Roberts said many fires had begun with a spark from electrical infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Under state law, compensation cases for issues such as loss of goods from freezers are ruled out so that any decision to disconnect is made only on safety grounds without concern about finances.</p>

      <h3>Feeling hot in November strain</h3>
      <p>Searing temperatures set November records tumbling on Wednesday as very hot and dry north to north-westerly winds swept across the state.</p>
      <p>More than a dozen locations had their hottest November day, many of them with temperatures climbing above 40C in the late afternoon, Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Mark Anolak said.</p>
      <p>Ceduna, on the far West Coast, was the first place in South Australia to reach 40C on Wednesday, at 10.19am, and topped out at 46.2C about 3pm.</p>
      <p>Damaging winds with gusts of up to 90km/h raised dust over western and central parts of the state and reduced visibility to a minimum in some areas.</p>
      <p>“It’s been hot, records broken, hottest temperatures for November across the state,” Mr Anolak said.</p>
      <p>“It certainly is an abnormal event, unusual, but hopefully we gave the warning out to people well in advance and they were certainly well aware of it coming.</p>
      <p>“So that’s all we can do really in the forecasting team, to make people aware of what’s likely to happen with the weather.”</p>
      <p>Temperature records continued to fall around lunchtime at Cultana on the Eyre Peninsula, Stenhouse Bay on the Yorke Peninsula, Parndana and Kingscote Airport on Kangaroo Island, Murray Bridge Airport and Hindmarsh Island.</p>
      <p>The mercury reached 46.6C at 1.52pm on the Nullarbor, but the temperature plummeted to 22.6C by 4.30pm after a cool change.</p>
      <p>Nuriootpa, Robe, Parafield, Padthaway, Clare, Strathalbyn, Lameroo and Naracoorte also recorded their hottest November day.</p>
      <p>The bureau released a map showing large areas of the state were more than 16C above the November average.</p>
      <p>Adelaide’s maximum temperature of 41.6C, at 4.21pm, was just shy of the November record.</p>
      <p>Top temperatures for some towns, such as Mount Barker, Victor Harbour, Warooka, Keith and Meningie, will not be known until 9am Thursday because their weather stations are staffed by volunteers.</p>
      <p>The bureau said it was very hot, dry and windy across the state ahead of a vigorous front moving across the west on Wednesday afternoon, reaching central and southern parts of SA overnight.</p>
      <p>More than 110 government schools and kindergartens closed due to the extreme weather conditions, while others chose to announce partial shutdowns.</p>
      <p>Chloe Noyes, 16, who is in Year 11 at St John’s Grammar, Belair, said she should have been in school doing tests ahead of her exams.</p>
      <p>“I’m missing out on my education today, like many other students,” she said.</p>
      <p>“My house is at risk, my friends’ houses are at risk, people are having to evacuate around my area and this is all due to the climate crisis.”</p>
      <p>Chloe said she attended the Strike4Climate event in September to urge politicians to take more <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/ae04e8ba20aaf1206b3074a5fe9c00ac">action on climate change</a>.</p>

      <p>Year 6 student Maddy, 11, said Calvary Lutheran Primary School, in Morphett Vale, had been “advising and telling kids not to come to school”.</p>
      <p>The heat and high winds also prompted a warning from health authorities about the threat of increased dust and other issues.</p>
      <p>Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier warned people with pre-existing chest or heart conditions to stay indoors, avoid exposure to the conditions and to follow their personal management plans.</p>
      <p>Adelaide is expecting a top of 21C on Wednesday with a 20 per cent chance of rain.</p>
      <p>Most of the state is forecast to record maximum temperatures in the 20s, but it could rise into the 30s in Renmark.</p>

      <p>It’s hot and dusty on the dog fence near Coober Pedy, but there’s no other place Alan Walton would rather be.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, as the temperature soared above 40C and a strong northerly roared in, he was out on the fence, finding and repairing any holes or weaknesses.</p>
      <p>Alan was patrolling the eastern edge of the 321km stretch he is charged with looking after – about 850km north of Adelaide.</p>
      <p>His battle-weary but reliable old Toyota Hilux has no airconditioning.</p>
      <p>He loves the work and understands it’s a job that must be done come rain, hail or, like Wednesday, stinking-hot conditions.</p>
      <p>“The job that we do up here, it’s not only the fence itself but it’s also the elements you have to deal with,” says Alan, who has endured temperatures of 50C in the past.</p>
      <p>“But if it’s hot, it’s hot. There’s nothing you can do about it, you’ve just got to deal with it.”</p>
      <p>Alan recalls with somewhat fondness the time a few years ago he had to replace a long section of fence during a tour – or five-day period – when the temperature consistently topped 50C.</p>
      <p>He recruited his eldest daughter Caitlin to give him a hand, and the pair hammered star droppers into the parched earth and strung up wire for days.</p>
      <p>Whenever he’s working in the heat, he respects the conditions and is conscious of monitoring his fluid intake.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to (keep the fluid intake up), ‘cos it (the heat) can knock you around pretty quick,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The other main thing that’s important is a good hat – you’d be amazed the difference a good hat can make in keeping your head a bit cooler.”</p>
