      <h1>Galaxy Note10 in red and pink is now available in the US</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=25" target="_blank">Vlad</a></address>
      <p>Just in time for the holidays, Samsung has made two new hues available for the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_note10-9788.php">Galaxy Note10</a> in the US. These are Aura Red and Aura Pink. For now, they are exclusive to the Korean company's <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-note10/buy/">own online store</a>, where you can pick them up unlocked, or with a carrier contract, where your choice is between Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and US Cellular.</p>

      <p>The unlocked price starts at $949.99, but with an eligible trade-in that could go down to as little as $689.99. You can also use Samsung Financing to pay $28.75 per month for the handset for two years, with 0% APR.</p>
      <p>At the moment the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_note10+-9732.php">Note10+</a> isn't available in these new colors, but that might hopefully change soon. If it does happen, we're assuming it won't take long, as the company probably wants to use the new hues to refresh people's interest in its flagship stylus-toting line of smartphones, as the holiday shopping season approaches. It's a strategy that it's used many times in the past.</p>

      <p>Final note: these colors aren't new per se, as they've been available in other markets, they're just new to the US, and we won't argue with that, as more choice is usually better.</p>
