      <p>Early indications suggest that Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa underwent a successful hip surgery, and while doctors are predicting a full recovery, the injury itself has caused quite a shakeup across NFL Draft boards.LSU quarterback Joe Burrow was already on pace to top Tua in Heisman Trophy votes, but the verdict was still out as to which of these to SEC signal callers was best equipped to make the transition to the pros.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mybookie.ag/sportsbook/college-football/heisman-trophy/">Oddsmakers at MyBookie</a> have moved Burrow up to the -1200 to win the Heisman, with Tua falling to +1000, good enough for third in the running behind Ohio State’s Justin Fields (+600).</p>
      <p>Many viewed Tua Tagovailoa as the most well rounded of the two prospects, but after sustaining an injury most commonly associated with a severe car crash, sportsbook oddsmakers are expecting the qb to fall out of the top ten selections, and are even questioning if he will make the transition to the NFL at all.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tua Tagovailoa NFL draft position </b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1-10: +200</li>
        <li>11-20: +150</li>
        <li>21-32: +300</li>
        <li>Rounds 2-7: +300</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Total QBs selected before Tagovailoa in 2020 NFL Draft</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 2.5</li>
        <li>Under 2.5</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Will Tua Tagovailoa play for Alabama in Week 1 of 2020 season?</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yes +300</li>
        <li>No -500</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Doctors estimate that Tagovailoa should be able to throw again by spring 2020, but this timeline makes his participation in the NFL combine unlikely. A similar injury not only sidelined NFL star Bo Jackson, but ended his career, and teams in position to take a quarterback with an early pick can’t possibly sign on the rookie with any sort of confidence in his ability to return to his former abilities.</p>
      <p>The +300 odds of him being selected in the 2nd to 7th rounds of the draft might offer up the best value, as teams are aware of his abilities, but the question marks surrounding his future have essentially taken him out of First Round consideration.</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Adam Schefter compared the Tua situation to the one faced by Dallas Cowboy linebacker Jaylon Smith, who was highly regarded as the top defensive prospect in the 2016 NFL Draft and was expected to be a top ten pick.</p>
      <p>In his final collegiate game, Smith suffered tears to both his ACL and MCL which saw his draft stock plummet, with him eventually being selected by the Cowboys with the 34th selection.</p>
      <p>The silver lining in this comparison would be that Jaylon Smith and the Cowboys recently inked a five-year, $64 million contract extension prior to the start of the season, and was selected as team captain.</p>
      <p>This does offer a glimmer of hope for Tagovailoa and his NFL future, but quarterbacks are subject to a different kind of punishment on a weekly basis, and ones hip mobility plays a major role in their throwing power and mechanics.</p>
