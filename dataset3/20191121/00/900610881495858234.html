      <h1>Hilton Honors adds Lyft points redemption option</h1>

      <p>Hilton Honors members can now redeem points against journeys with rideshare firm Lyft.</p>
      <p>The new redemption option went live this week at <a href="http://www.hiltonhonorslyft.com/"><b>hiltonhonorslyft.com</b></a>, with members able to redeem a minimum of 4,500 points for $10 of Lyft credit.</p>
      <p>A maximum of 45,000 points can be exchanged for $100 in credit per day, and Lyft credits can be shared with friends of family – members just need to enter the phone number of the person they would like the credit sent to during the redemption process.</p>
      <p>The new redemption option is available to members globally, for Lyft rides taken in the US and Canada.</p>
      <p>The new features builds on the existing partnership between Hilton Honors and Lyft, <a href="https://www.businesstraveller.com/business-travel/2019/05/16/hilton-honors-partners-with-lyft-to-offer-point-earning-and-spending/"><b>which was launched earlier this year</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Members who link their two accounts can earn up to three Hilton Honors points per $1 spent with Lyft, and will also get $3 off their first Lyft ride as a new user.</p>
      <p>The Hilton Honors app has also been updated to allow members to request Lyft rides through the app when staying at a group hotel, with their hotel location automatically populating as the pickup point.</p>
