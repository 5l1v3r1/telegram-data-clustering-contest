      <h1>It's been five years since Messi beat Zarra's record; he's almost doubled his numbers since</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.besoccer.com/writer/besoccer" target="_blank">BeSoccer</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>November 22, 2014 was the date Leo Messi became LaLiga's all-time leading scorer. He surpassed the mythical Telmo Zarra's 252 goals. On the fifth anniversary of that date, the Argentinian's numbers are portentous; he is close to surpassing it for the second time.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He is one of the biggest record breakers in the history of sport. On the <b>fifth anniversary of his hat-trick in Seville</b>, with which he reached 253 goals, looking at his goal scoring record shows he has not slowed down one bit. </p>
      <p>The king of LaLiga now accumulates a whopping<b> 427 goals</b>. He has never come down from that position and it will take many years for someone to lower him from his pedestal. </p>
      <p>Messi needed <b>289 games to score those 253 goals and beat Zarra</b>. Since then, the passing of time has clearly not diminished his talents: his average has surpassed in goal per game. Specifically, he leads <b>174 goals in 170 duels</b>. Brutal numbers. Before, he scored in 54% of the matches it played; now he scores 65%. </p>
      <p>So the Argentinian striker is only 78 goals away from adding up the 252 goals, but for the second time. In other words, if that night against Sevilla his counter had been set to zero, <b>he would be only a dozen away from entering the 'top ten' </b>of the competition's historic top scorers. </p>
      <p>The podium of historical goalscorers in LaLiga counts with, besides Messi, <b>Cristiano Ronaldo (311) and Zarra (252).</b> He is followed by Hugo Sánchez (234) and Raúl (228). Of those who are active.</p>

      <h3>The classification since the day he overtook Zarra</h3>
      <p>That night began a new career in which, although it may be thought that his only real competition was Cristiano Ronaldo, <b>Luis Suarez</b> became his real challenger, despite sharing the attack.</p>
      <p>Close to the 174 goals Messi has scored since 2014 are the <b>Uruguayan's 137</b>, which carries more than the 114 the Portuguese scored. Behind, <b>Griezmann (95), Iago Aspas (79) and Benzema (78). </b></p>
      <p>But as Cristiano is still active, let's look at the table including the five major leagues. Then the Portuguese would be second, thanks to his <b>140 goals</b>. <b>Lewandowski</b>, with one more than Luis Suarez, would be the third.</p>
