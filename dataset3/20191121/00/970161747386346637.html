        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liam-payne/">Liam Payne</a> was a proud boyfriend as he showed girlfriend Maya Henry off to the world while arriving at And Juliet’s press night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> singer smized as star after star arrived for the musical, which focuses on what would have happened if Juliet – from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet – never killed herself.</p>
      <p>We’re interested already.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old wrapped his hand around his girlfriend’s waist and made sure we all knew that they’re a ridiculously good-looking couple.</p>
      <p>Liam went for the ‘too cool to care’ leather jacket and white shirt ensemble while Maya, 19, brought back the ’40s in a black sequin dress with even more sequins dangling off the bottom.</p>
      <p>Their public romance comes after a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/liam-payne-arrives-city-love-maya-henry-amid-confusion-models-age-11181469/">savvy internet sleuth figured out there is a huge possibility his beau is a year younger</a> than reported.</p>

      <p>One such detective tweeted last week: ‘Every article about Liam’s girlfriend says she’s 19 when she’s actually 18.</p>
      <p>‘This is intentional because when fabricating this ridiculous PR campaign for her they said that they’ve been together for a year, which would mean that Liam was dating a 17 y/o. She’s a senior in HS.’</p>

      <p>However, Strip That Down singer Liam – who has two-year-old son Bear with ex Cheryl Cole – hit back at the claims, tweeting: ’19, don’t believe everything you read on the internet.’</p>
      <p>Uh, nice save there, Liam.</p>
      <p>In a clip from her family’s reality show Hanging With Los Henrys, from 2018, Maya said she was 17 and that she’d be 18 in December – meaning that Maya would now be 18, and turning 19 in a few weeks time.</p>

      <p>Guess we’ll never know.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Jessie J, Simon Cowell and his girlfriend Lauren Silverman, and Nicole Scherzinger were also in attendance at Shaftesbury Theatre in London last on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Nicole, 41, went for full glam and was dressed to kill as she arrived in a black sequin bodycon dress.</p>
      <p>Both Simon and Jessie J opted for a smart blazer but Jessie’s was a little bit more on the silky chic side.</p>
