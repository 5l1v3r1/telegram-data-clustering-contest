      <p>Broadridge believes that the addition of ClearStructure will help it create “differentiated” solutions in the market and serve new clients.</p>
      <p>“ClearStructure’s component services enhance our existing multi-asset class, front-to-back office solution.” says Erick Bernstein, Broadridge head of asset management solutions.</p>
      <p>“This acquisition aligns to Broadridge’s strategy of providing a true cross-asset platform to enable asset management clients to have a single view into their entire book of business.”</p>
