      <p>Al Murray has said he would not retire his Pub Landlord alter-ego because he would “get in a right tangle” if he had to be himself on stage.</p>
      <p>The comedian, who has performed stand-up in the guise of the beer-swilling publican with right-wing views for 25 years, said that the character’s thoughts come to him naturally, while he personally tends to be more doubtful.</p>
      <p>Murray, 51, told the PA news agency: “If I had to be me, I wouldn’t know where to start, that’s the basic problem.</p>
      <aside>You have to be certain and I'm not a very certain person. I've got a lot of doubt about a lot of stuff</aside>
      <p>“If I’m him I know what to say next, I know what he thinks of things, it’s all just obvious.</p>
      <p>“Whereas if I’m me and I wanted to talk about Brexit, for example, I’d get in a right tangle because I think all sorts of things all at once. The Pub Landlord is very definite and in comedy you have to be definite.</p>
      <p>“You have to be certain and I’m not a very certain person. I’ve got a lot of doubt about a lot of stuff.</p>
      <p>“I certainly have a tendency to agree with the last person I spoke to.”</p>
      <p>Murray, who will continue on his Landlord Of Hope And Glory stand-up tour throughout the rest of November and into December, said he is not struggling to keep up with the ever-changing political news agenda in his routine.</p>
      <p>“A big part of what the show is about is about how everything is changing every day, and how we seem to be caught in a permanent state of it all happening, all at once, and that fundamentally nothing has changed yet,” he said.</p>

      <p>“That’s been the really interesting thing (about Brexit), that in three years absolutely nothing has changed at all.”</p>
      <p>Murray – who went up against Ukip’s Nigel Farage for the seat of South Thanet during the 2015 General Election – said he has no problem with addressing politics on stage, unlike other comedians who prefer to avoid the topic.</p>
      <p>“Since I came up with the Pub Landlord 25 years ago, he wanted to leave the EU, so I can’t exactly go avoiding that as a subject now that it’s on the cards,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He’s kind of in a ‘be careful what you wish for’ situation.”</p>
      <p>Murray added: “Comedy is a pretty traditional reaction to tricky times, and you either tear your hair out or you laugh at it.</p>
      <p>“And actually I find a lot of it nakedly funny, a lot of what’s happened in the last three years – the double-speak that people have had to do in order to carry on in this Brexit situation, or the double-think that is required – is hilarious.</p>

      <p>“The idea that you shut Parliament because you’re trying to restore parliamentary sovereignty, which is what we were told Brexit was for, that’s funny. You couldn’t make it up.”</p>
      <p>Murray’s Landlord Of Hope And Glory tour will continue from November 22 at Chatham’s Central Theatre.</p>
      <p>The run of shows includes a performance on November 30 at the recently renovated Brentwood Live in Essex, which has undergone a £500,000 makeover, making it one of the biggest concert arenas in the county.</p>
      <p>The tour will conclude at Worthing’s Assembley Hall and Richmond Room on December 5.</p>
