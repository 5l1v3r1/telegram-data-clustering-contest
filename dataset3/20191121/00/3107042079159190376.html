      <p>Tasmania is bracing for the Australian state's most dangerous fire conditions this bushfire season, with dry winds and hot temperatures forecast.</p>
      <p>The fire danger over much of the state's south and east on Thursday is considered severe, the third-highest of six ratings.</p>

      <p>Temperatures are forecast to peak in the mid-30s in parts, with Hobart expected to reach 33degCelsius.</p>
      <p>Tasmania Fire Service Deputy Chief Officer Bruce Byatt said crews are on stand-by in what is expected to be the worst conditions of the bushfire season to date.</p>
      <p>A 24-hour total fire ban stretching across the island's east, south, north and centre is in place from 2am.</p>
      <p>Dry winds of 60-70km/h are forecast, but relief is expected on Thursday afternoon when a cold front crosses the state.</p>
      <p>Wildfires in October threatened shack communities in the Central Highlands, prompting authorities to declare the start of the bushfire season.</p>

        <b>SOUTH AUSTRALIA EMERGENCY CONTINUES</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Australia's fire emergency continues with residents in the southern Yorke Peninsula being told to leave as an uncontrolled stubble fire continues to make headway.</p>
      <p>The fire near Edithburgh is moving in a north-easterly direction toward Coobowie and Wool Bay.</p>
      <p>"This fire may pose a threat to lives directly in its path," the SA Country Fire Service said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"Leave, if the path is clear to a safer place, as it will soon be too dangerous to drive."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, residents in Price and Port Clinton on the upper Yorke Peninsula are still on the alert for a wind change expected on Thursday that could threaten homes and lives.</p>
      <p>But the fire threat has eased in other areas with authorities downgrading warnings on the worst of more than 40 fires across the state.</p>
      <p>In the most serious blaze on the peninsula on Wednesday, some houses and sheds are thought to have been lost to a fire that threatened the lives of about 1000 people living in the Yorketown area.</p>
      <p>The fire started close to homes as the state sweltered through catastrophic fire conditions, with soaring temperatures and high winds.</p>
      <p>The loss of property was yet to be confirmed but there were reports a number of houses had been destroyed.</p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of any injuries with the fire burning mostly in stubble.</p>
      <p>Late on Wednesday, the Country Fire Service downgraded the alert for Yorketown from an emergency warning to a watch and act.</p>
      <p>But it said the blaze was yet to be contained as it burned on two fronts, in a westerly direction towards Port Moorowie and in an easterly direction towards Edithburgh, Coobowie and Port Giles.</p>
      <p>A number of other fires across SA on Wednesday prompted emergency warnings, including a second blaze on Yorke Peninsula, two others north of Adelaide and one in the Barossa Valley. They were later downgraded.</p>
      <p>A cool change was expected to sweep across the state early on Thursday but the CFS warned the dangerous conditions would linger.</p>
      <p>The Bureau of Meteorology had a severe weather warning in place for potentially damaging winds across a wide area, including most of the York and Eyre peninsulas and the Adelaide Hills.</p>
      <p>It said wind gusts of up to 90km/h were possible as a cold front moved through.</p>
