      <p><i>Dhruva Sarja’s break from work for wedding is strictly utilitarian <br/></i><br/>Dhruva Sarja has taken only a 10-day-break from work for his wedding. The wedding with Prerana Shankar is scheduled for the 23rd and 24th of this month followed by a reception for fans the next day. He will be back shooting for Pogaru two days later. <br/><br/><br/>The two were engaged in December last year. They were known to each other and were neighbours for years. Dhruva’s elder brother, actor Chiranjeevi Sarja and actress Meghana Raj had married earlier in 2018. <br/><br/>To maintain the continuity of look for the shooting, Dhruva will carry his bearded look to his wedding. “He may trim the beard a bit but the beard will remain,” said director Nanda Kishore. <br/><br/>Dhruva, as has been his habit, does only one film at a time. The weight transformation to play a 14-year-old in this film required many months of effort. When the shooting resumes later this month after the wedding, it will be the last schedule. Director Nanda Kishore is confident of getting the ‘first copy’ of the film ready by the end of December. The cast of the film includes Ravishankar, Rashmika Mandanna, Sadhu Kokila, Chikkanna and Kuri Prataph. International bodybuilders Kai Greene and Morgan Aste are also among those who have acted in this film.</p>
