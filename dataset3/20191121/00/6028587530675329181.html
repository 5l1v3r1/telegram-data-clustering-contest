      <p>Singer/songwriter/harmonica player Rick Estrin, who has been called a combination of jive-talking carnival side-show hustler and world class musician is the most colorful and entertaining showman around.  Dressed in forties hipster-style sharkskin suits, white shoes, and hair in a pompadour, he and his band Rick Estrin &amp; The Nightcats have just released their latest album, <i>Contemporary. </i>This<i> </i>studio album (their fourth) delivers twelve foot-stomping wise-cracking contemporary songs, a combination of rockabilly, jazz, blues, rock, and big band swing.</p>

      <p>Rick Estrin and the Nightcats tour non-stop and receive standing ovations wherever they play. This Sunday, Nov. 24<sup>th</sup> they will be playing at NYC’s <a href="https://www.theiridium.com/">Iridium </a>For the touring schedule, <a href="https://rickestrin.com/calendar">check here. </a>I caught up with Rick Estrin in California the day before he and the band  flew to the East Coast for the tour.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Was harmonica your first instrument, and why did you chose it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>My first instrument was guitar, but my father died when I was 15, coinciding with a guy giving me a harmonica and telling me how to play it. I was heartbroken and angry and the harmonica gave me a way to express that. The sound of the harmonica is so close to a human voice that I just felt like I could express myself with it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When did you start songwriting?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As a teenager. I went on the road for the first time when I was 18 with Rodger Collins, an R&amp;B singer who had a hit record, <i>She's Looking Good</i>. He wrote that song and Wilson Pickett covered it.  Collins encouraged me to write.</p>
      <p>I always believed I could write songs. I love the way songs are put together and the effect they make. I took a long break from trying to write songs when I was trying to learn classic Chicago blues. Then I got with Little Charlie and when we were signed to Alligator Records in 1986 we used all my songs on the first record so I had to really knuckle down and get to work.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What does writing songs mean to you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's probably one of the most satisfying things I do, and also the thing I resist a lot because it can be very frustrating until you break through. And then it’s just fun and rewarding</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did you meet Fillmore Slim?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was over at my friend’s house and I could hear somebody playing blues guitar plugged into an amp across the hall. I knocked on the door and it was Fillmore Slim. He invited me in. I knew who he was because he was famous, the most well-known pimp in the United States at that time. I invited him to come to the club where I was playing and he came with another guy. I thought the other guy must be a pimp too, because he had all kinds of diamonds and was dressed so great, but it turns out it was Rodger Collins who came with Fillmore.</p>
      <p>Pretty soon after, Fillmore put me in his band. I’d ride around with Fillmore after the gig and he'd go do his business. But Rodger Collins really taught me a lot about songwriting, show business, both the show part and the business part.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What was the most important thing that Fillmore Slim taught you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was that even though I thought he was really cool, I wasn't cut out to be a pimp. It took me a minute to learn that.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Is your entire band as outrageous as you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The whole band is entertaining. Kid Andersen has no inhibitions on stage. He's fun to watch. We have a drummer who for 17 years was Little Richard's drummer and he lifts the whole thing up. He's so entertaining to watch and such a great, great musician that it just makes everybody step up their game. He's riveting. It's all I can do to face the audience. I just want to watch him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How did you meet Muddy and what happened?</b>
      </p>
      <p>When I was 19, I moved to Chicago to play blues because Fillmore had left the band. We worked in one club in San Francisco for five nights a week for almost a year. It was a great education for me just having that experience. Then, I wasn't doing anything and my girlfriend had kicked me out, so I had nowhere to go. I was friends with Jerry Portnoy who had been living in San Francisco but his father got sick and he moved back to Chicago. He kept sending me postcards telling me I should come out there, so I did.</p>
      <p>I was at Theresa's on Blue Monday and it was packed. Buddy Guy was playing guitar, Fred Beal was playing drums. Junior Wells was there, Carey Bell, everybody was there. Carey Bell was playing harp with Muddy at the time because Paul Oscher had just. Carey told me he was doing a gig with Muddy that weekend and if I came down, I could sit in; and if Muddy liked me I could have the gig, because he was going to quit.</p>
      <p>I went and waited around all night. Muddy never called me up. I said  to Muddy, "Why didn't you call me up?" He said "Oh, come back tomorrow." So I came back the next night and he called me up and I played “Long Distance Call.” After they went on break, he was sitting at a booth with a bunch of women and he crocked his finger and beckoned me over and stood up shaking his finger in my face, and goes "Man, you outta sight, boy! You play like a man, boy! You got that sound boy, I know that sound when I hear it. That's my sound!"</p>
      <p>So I was pretty much levitating. He gave me his phone number and I gave him the number where I was staying and he asked me what I was doing. I told him I was thinking about going back to California and he said, don’t leave town for at least two weeks. I kept waiting for him to call. At the time, Bruce Iglauer, before he had Alligator Records was working at the Jazz Record Mart and was trying to manage Carey Bell, trying to set up a European tour for Carey under his own name.</p>
      <p>I called Bruce and said, "Is Carey going to quit? Because otherwise I think I'm going to leave town." He said, "No, this tour is not coming together, I don't think Carey's going to quit." So I split. A little bit after that, Carey quit and Muddy hired Mojo Buford. Then next time I saw the band, Fuzz and Willie said, "What happened to you, man? You were supposed to be with us. You cut out." I told that to Paul Oscher later and Paul said, "You should've called because he probably gave you that number to see how bad you wanted it."</p>
      <p>
        <b>In retrospect, is it a good thing you missed the call?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Knowing me then and the kind of nut I was and the things I still had to do go through, I think I was too big of a screw up to really hang onto that gig for too long. And knowing how delusional I was and stuff, I probably would've gotten killed by somebody thinking I was so cool because I was in Muddy Water's band. And I got an opportunity to front a band and to develop my own thing rather than being somebody's sideman. So it all worked out fine. I've had pretty much an absurdly lucky trajectory.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You tour 2/3rds of the year. What's the best thing about touring?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I love it. The interpersonal dynamics in the band are just great. We always have a ball together on the bandstand and off, and I think that the fact that we're friends and have fun together off the bandstand translates into the performance and to the audience. That's something you can't fake. I love that part of it. There's something about touring that makes me feel free. Like when I'm on the road, I feel like nobody can get me. I love motels, I love the do-not- disturb sign. I love testing the limits of my endurance because you get so tired out there, sometimes. It can be pretty grueling, but I like that too, just knowing I can do it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there anything left you still have to accomplish?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you'd told me that I would be on Alligator Records for over 30 years that I would be writing hundreds of songs that people know and ask for and I would have a career where I could I have a house bought and paid for just from being myself and clamoring around with the harmonica? I'm doing great. And if I never do any better, I did pretty good.</p>
