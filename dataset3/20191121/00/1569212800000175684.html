      <p>Enterprise email and marketing automation provider iPost has announced a new <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/ipost_announces_full_native_magento_integration/prweb16736750.htm">integration</a> with Adobe’s Magento commerce cloud. The integration will pass customer data stored in Magento to the iPost platform to help marketers create and deliver personalized messages and cross-channel campaigns.</p>
      <p>Transactional emails from Magento can also now be sent through the iPost platform. The integration will provide accessibility to Magento data in iPost including customers, orders, emails and forms. Magento data can also be applied to iPost’s automation engine that makes adjustments to individual customer journeys based on their past-purchase behavior and transactions.</p>
