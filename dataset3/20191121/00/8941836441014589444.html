      <p>KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii (AP) - The Hawaii County Council has become the first local government in the state to ban the use of herbicides on public property.</p>
      <p>West Hawaii Today reported the council passed a bill Wednesday to ban the use of 30 herbicides over four years.</p>
      <p>Officials say the ban covers parks and areas alongside roads, bikeways, sidewalks, trails, drainage, and waterways owned or maintained by the county.</p>
      <p>Officials say the bill does not apply to private property or to residents who maintain land adjacent to county easements or lease agricultural land from the county.</p>
      <p>Supporters say scientific studies show links between herbicides and cancer, decreased cognitive function and behavioral problems in children, as well as damage to marine environments.</p>

      <p>Opponents say the county’s bill is too expansive.</p>
