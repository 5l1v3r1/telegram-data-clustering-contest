      <p><i>“Even the most circumspect friend of the market would concede that the volume of brokers’ loans—of loans collateraled by the securities purchased on margin—is a good index of the volume of speculation.”</i> -John Kenneth Galbraith, <i>The Great Crash 1929</i></p>
      <p>The “index of the volume of speculation,” as Galbraith called it, last year hit a high not seen at any point since prior to the Great Crash of 1929. And, while the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> recently hit new highs, margin debt relative to GDP recently fell below its lows from late last year. This suggests that investor risk appetites, after soaring to a euphoric extreme in 2018, are simply not supportive of stock prices in a broad sense in 2019.</p>

      <p>What’s more, over the past 20 years, with the exception of the 2016 episode, when margin debt has begun to fall from such lofty levels it has coincided with a major market peak in stocks. Indeed, along with margin debt, the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nyse-composite">NYSE Composite</a>, <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/smallcap-2000">Russell 2000</a> and the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/dj-transportation-average">Dow Transportation Average</a> all remain below their 2018 highs. Investors chasing the new highs in the S&amp;P 500 clearly believe, “this time is different.”</p>
