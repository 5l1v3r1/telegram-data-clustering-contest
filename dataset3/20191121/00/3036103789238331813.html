      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>MultiChoice has launched two new channels on its DStv platform – CBS Justice and CuriosityStream.</p>
      <p>Both of the channels went live this morning.</p>
      <p>The company has also made Euronews (channel 414) available on all DStv packages in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Euronews was previously available to DStv Compact Plus subscribers in other African countries.</p>
      <h3>Non-fiction content</h3>
      <p>CBS Justice is a 24/7 crime channel which is available to Premium and Compact Plus subscribers on DStv channel 170.</p>
      <p>Its content will include crime investigation documentaries and shows, with titles such as CSI, NCIS, and Diagnosis Murder.</p>
      <p>CuriosityStream is a Premium-only offering and is being aired on channel 185.</p>
      <p>This channel’s programme includes non-fictional documentaries and series covering science, nature, technology, history, lifestyle, and society.</p>
      <p>Its line-up includes shows such as Genius by Stephen Hawking, Wonders of Life, and Deep Time History.</p>
      <h3>Channel changes</h3>
      <p>In October 2019, DStv <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/321868-dstv-cutting-channels-here-is-the-truth.html"><b>announced</b></a> that it was cutting three channels – History, Crime and Investigation, and Lifetime – from its bouquet.</p>
      <p>The decision was made due to the contract term with the provider of these channels, American broadcasting company A&amp;E Networks, coming to an end on 1 November.</p>
      <p>DStv later managed to secure an agreement to keep History and Lifetime on its platform.</p>
