      <p>Nicolo Zaniolo said he is "very happy" at Roma amid links to Premier League giants Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo signed a long-term contract with Roma through to June 2024, but it has not stopped speculation over his future.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Italy international, who joined Roma last season, has reportedly attracted interest from United.</p>
      <p>But Zaniolo wants to repay the confidence shown in him by Serie A side Roma.</p>
      <p>"The minimum objective this season is to improve day by day. We want to win every game. The objective is qualifying for the Champions League," Zaniolo told Sky Sport Italia.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy, Roma have given me so much confidence, now I'll repay it on the pitch. I'm proud to represent these fans, I feel very good here.</p>
      <p>"The things Fonseca has to say, he says to your face. He's a very direct person and heâ€™s helping me improve."</p>
      <p>Zaniolo scored a brace in Italy's 9-1 demolition of Armenia in Euro 2020 qualifying on Monday.</p>
      <p>At club level, Zaniolo has netted five goals in all competitions for Roma this term.</p>
