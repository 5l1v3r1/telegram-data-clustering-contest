        <b>Benzema is currently top of the table after his excellent start to the season. However, he is closely followed by Leo Messi who is 1 goal behind.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As we approach matchday 14, <b>Benzema finds himself top with 9 goals</b>. The Frenchman has had a fine start to the season and got <b>2 goals in his side's 4-0 triumph away to Eibar</b> before the international break.</p>
      <p>He is closely followed by <b>Messi, Morón and Moreno who all have 8 goals</b>. Messi has been on fire since he came back from injury. He even got a <b>hat-trick against Celta Vigo</b> and will be hoping to add to his tally in Saturday's match against Leganés.</p>
