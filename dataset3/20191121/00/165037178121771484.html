      <h1>Las Palmas rule out signing Barca's Riqui Puig to replace Viera</h1>

        <b>Las Palmas are working on the signing of a player to substitute Jonathan Viera in January 2020. However, they are not planning on signing Riqui Puig from Barca B, Miguel Angel Ramirez, the Las Palmas president, confirmed in a press conference.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/j-viera-32016/">Viera</a>, <b>on loan from Beijing Guoan until 31st December</b>, will almost certainly return to China. Although Las Palmas are leaving the door open for him to stay on, it looks very unlikely. <b>They are looking for a bigger name</b> to replace the local player. </p>
      <p>Ramirez surprised people by publicly revealing that Jonathan Viera <b>earns 10 million euros gross at the Chinese outfit</b>, "more than the entire Las Palmas budget. It was difficult for them to send him on loan to us <b>so we are very grateful to Beijing Guoan</b>," he highlighted. </p>
      <p>"We will have him until 31st December and when the date comes nearer, we will see what happens. <b>I cannot be publicly airing the club's strategy</b>. The player has helped us to get victories, but with him we are 15th in the league. If he leaves, we will bring another footballer and <b>we are already working on that</b>," the president said. </p>

      <p><b>With respect to Riqui Puig</b>, the Las Palmas president has assured that after Puig's name was linked with the club, he asked the sporting director and his team, <b>who denied any type of contact</b>. </p>
      <p>On the other hand, Ramirez has confirmed that <b>Tana will return after his loan spell at Zheijang Greentown FC</b> from the Chinese second division. He will probably rejoin the group in December so that Pepe Mel can decide <b>whether he stays or looks for a new club in January.</b></p>
