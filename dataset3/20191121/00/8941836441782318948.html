      <p>LONGVIEW, Wash. (AP) - Vape shop owners in Washington state have raised concerns that a statewide ban on flavored vaping products resulted in a loss of business for most companies.</p>
      <p>Longview Daily News reports that two Cowlitz County stores are changing the way they do business to avoid closing down including replacing vaping products with cannabidiol health and beauty products.</p>
      <p>Longview and Kelso Viper Vapor stores manager Marshall Brock says they had two options to close or rebrand after the 120-day state ban was enacted Oct. 9.</p>
      <p>Brock says he chose the latter to survive.</p>
      <p>Vape D Lish owner Allan Kettle estimates a third of vapor-only stores have closed.</p>

      <p>Kettle says one of his stores is scheduled to close Saturday.</p>
      <p>State officials say the ban is intended to combat an increase in vaping-related illness.</p>
