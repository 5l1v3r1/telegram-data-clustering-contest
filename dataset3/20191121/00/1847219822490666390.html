        <b>The Greek government has announced plans to shut down overcrowded open migrant camps to open closed and smaller centres.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50486209">British public broadcaster BBC reports</a> on Wednesday, November 20, the camps on five Greek islands off the Turkish coast are overcrowded. In September a woman died when a fire broke out at the Moria camp in Lesbos, where more than 15,000 asylum seekers live on a site designed for fewer than 3,000.</p>
      <p>The proposed sites are being described as «closed pre-departure centres», an announcement which the government in Athens hopes will be noticed by traffickers and potential asylum seekers alike.</p>
      <p>«A clear message should be sent to those planning or thinking of coming to the country illegally when they aren’t entitled to asylum,» explained Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas.</p>
      <p>The past few months have seen a big increase in numbers, with 10,551 arrivals by sea in Greece in September and a further 8,996 in October, BBC reports.</p>
