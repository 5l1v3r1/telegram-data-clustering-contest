        <b>Former Asante Kotoko midfielder Theophilus Nyame is on the verge of making a sensation return to the club, two years after leaving.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 26-year-old, who is a free agent since  leaving Medeama in 2018, has been training with the Porccupine Warriors to win a contract.</p>
      <p>The former Hasaacas enforcer has been linked with a move back to Kumasi which was short-lived after spending just a season at the club.</p>
      <p>He joined Medeama after failing to hold down a regular position at Kotoko, but injuries conspired against him in Tarkwa.</p>
      <p>The Mauve and Yellows <a href="https://ghanasoccernet.com/medeama-part-ways-with-midfielder-theophilus-nyame"><b>parted ways with the midfielder last year</b> </a>after just a season on his return from a loan spell at Ashantigold.</p>
