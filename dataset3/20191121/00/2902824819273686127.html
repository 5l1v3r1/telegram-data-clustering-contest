      <h1>"Any jungle in, guy?": Watch Chris Inperspective's set for Human Traffic Live</h1>
      <h2>Jungle power for Human Traffic Live</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">In association with Human Traffic Live</a></address>
      <p>The record store scene in rave classic <i><a href="https://mixmag.net/read/human-traffic-sequel-brexit-news">Human Traffic</a></i> is so iconic, a bunch of the film's most memorable quotes come from Koop in his junglist movement T-shirt.</p>
      <p>"I've got the Tarzan and Jane of jungle" and "it could turn Hare Krishna into a badboy" are just a couple of gems, with the buyers' request "Got any jungle in, guy?" is also a classic.</p>

      <p>It makes sense then that Human Traffic Live at <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/printworks-london-line-ups-2019-news">Printworks London</a> in 2020 - a three-week takeover with parties, pop-ups, immersive live performance and a '90s-themed exhibition - will pay homage to the scene. As part of the Human Traffic Live campaign, the likes of <a href="https://business.facebook.com/MixmagMagazine/videos/2458235037770907/">Danny Rampling</a>, Showhawk Duo and drum 'n' bass DJ and producer Chris Inperspective have all paid tribute to the 1999 film. For this, they played on a London bus parked up in the city, with the record store recreated in the vehicle.</p>
