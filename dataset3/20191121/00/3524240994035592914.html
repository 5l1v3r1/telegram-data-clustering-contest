      </p>
      <p>A 47-year-old contractor, Bashiru Olaitan, was on Wednesday arraigned before an Osun State Magistrates’ Court sitting in Osogbo for allegedly defrauding a company, Cadtech Nigeria Limited, of the sum of N6.3m.</p>
      <p>Olaitan, according to the police prosecutor, Ayodele Oladiran, presented himself as the owner of another company, Powerex Nigeria Limited, a claim he knew to be false.</p>
      <p>He was said to have fraudulently obtained the sum of N6.3m from Cadtech Nigeria Limited by claiming to be the owner of Powerex Nigeria Limited.</p>
      <p>Olaitan was charged with two counts of fraud and stealing.</p>
      <p>The offences were said to have been committed between June and September 2018 in Osogbo.</p>
      <p>The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges, which were said to be contrary to and punishable under sections 390 and 419 of the Criminal Code, Cap 34 Vol, 2, Laws of Osun State of Nigeria, 2002.</p>
