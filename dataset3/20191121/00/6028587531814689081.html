      <p>Unless you know someone headed to South America next summer, winter is the only time of year to learn to ski and snowboard. But they're daunting sports to learn, requiring multiple days of lessons – and several hours of picking oneself up off the snow, most likely. There's a lot of gear that comes in handy on the slopes, from clothing to helmets to accessories, but it can be costly to buy, especially for athletes still figuring out whether they like skiing. That means that having the correct gear (or being gifted with the correct gear) can make the difference between loving or hating time spent in the snow. The following list certainly isn't exhaustive but includes a variety of products sure to help beginner skiers and snowboarders feel a little more comfortable (and hopefully a little more confident) on the slopes.</p>

      <p>A sure-fire way to hate skiing lessons is to be wet and soggy while taking them, which is why a completely waterproof outer layer is a must-have for all skiers and riders. Unfortunately, new skiers often try to put off buying pricier gear, so why not treat the new skier you know to a seriously waterproof jacket that can progress with them from bunny slopes to backcountry adventures? The stylish <a href="https://amundsensports.com/">Amundsen Peak</a> Anorak for men or women is made with three layers of highly waterproof fabric, so it’ll keep skiers and riders dry in all-day snowstorms. Amundsen field-tests their gear in Antarctica, so it’s more than technical enough to handle resort groomers. This anorak has a large kangaroo pocket, convenient for storing a beanie or other small ski gear. A more affordable option is the Uinta Three-layer Jacket from outdoor retailer <a href="https://backcountry.com/">Backcountry.com</a>. It’s a more straightforward style but offers enough protection from rain and snow for most beginner skiers. </p>

      <p>The HAL is <a href="https://julbo.com/">Julbo</a>’s first foray into ski and snowboard helmets and is a no-brainer (pun intended) for any new skier or snowboarder. Beginner skiers may think they don’t need to wear a helmet if they’re just on the bunny slopes, but that couldn’t be more wrong. On-hill collisions can happen on any level terrain, and having someone on a ski lift pull the safety bar down on your head is no fun, either. With a magnetic clasp, lightweight build and venting panels to prevent overheating, the Julbo Helmet has features usually found in more expensive models at a fairly entry-level price.</p>

      <p>A good base layer should pull sweat and moisture away from your body while also trapping heat. Many beginner skiers and riders make the mistake of wearing whatever long-sleeve shirt they already own as a base layer. The problem with that is that many popular fabrics, like cotton, don’t dry very quickly or do much to warm the core. So help make sure your giftee stays warm and dry when they break a sweat with a base layer from <a href="https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/home">Icebreaker</a>. Their mock turtleneck base layers are warm and comfortable and come in a variety of designs for <a href="https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/mens-baselayers">men</a> and women stylish enough to carry them from skiing to après-ski bar hopping. </p>

      <p>Ski boots are incredibly uncomfortable, especially for new skiers still working on breaking them in. Unfortunately, blisters and sore spots are common after a day on the slopes, which is why a D.I.Y. foot care kit can be the perfect thoughtful (and creative) gift. The combination of a comfortable pair of $27 <a href="https://www.smartwool.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/VFSearchDisplay?sType=SimpleSearch&amp;catalogId=11701&amp;searchSource=Q&amp;beginIndex=0&amp;storeId=7501&amp;langId=-1&amp;searchTerm=PhD%C2%AE+Ski+Medium+Pattern+Socks">PhD® Ski Medium Pattern Socks</a> (a heavily cushioned ski sock), a $10 <a href="https://www.medzonecorp.com/products/blisterzone">BlisterZone skin relief stick</a>, and a $25 <a href="https://buywildflower.com/collections/topicals/products/cbd-cool-stick?variant=13958179979325">CBD ache relief Cool Stick from Wildflower </a>(legal in all states) can be a welcome find in any skier's stocking. Socks from SmartWool also make a thoughtful gift on their own as they're all made from merino wool, a soft fabric that naturally wicks away perspiration to keep feet warm and dry. </p>

      <p>Beginner skiers may think they can wear whatever cheap pair of goggles they found on sale online, but they’ll quickly realize that’s an error. Varying types of terrain and light conditions require different lenses – for example, a dark lens intended for sunny days is going to be nearly impossible to see through if it starts snowing. So treat the skier in your life to a high-tech pair of goggles like the Giro Method. The lenses make it easier to see bumps and obstacles ahead by enhancing contrast on the snow, which is something beginner skiers need. The Method also comes with two different lenses for different weather, so it’s like having two pairs of goggles. Skiers will appreciate having a sunny day and a snowy day lens instead of trying to squint through the wrong lens when the weather changes unexpectedly – and the large, cylindrical lens definitely scores points for style.</p>

      <p>Beginner skiers and snowboarders should plan on spending a lot of time falling, whether they’re on the bunny slopes or starting to progress to more challenging terrain. That means their hands are going to get very wet very quickly if they wear fabric gloves or mittens not intended for wet conditions. At under $100, Oros’ mittens are completely waterproof and insulated with the same material NASA used to insulate space shuttles, so it’ll keep skiers’ hands warm even in the chilliest of extreme mountain conditions. They come in colors and styles for men and women and have a clip at the wrist to ensure they stay together when not in use.</p>

      <p>Stopping to ditch a layer in between runs can be a hassle, especially if you have to take off your helmet and goggles, but skiers really shouldn’t skip out on wearing a mid-layer. They play a critical role both in trapping body heat and keeping the cold outside air away from the core. Fortunately, <a href="https://patagonia.com/">Patagonia</a> eliminated the need to ditch a layer mid-run with the Nano Air Hoodie (also available as a jacket or vest,) a soft-shell mid-layer that both warms <i>and </i>cools. The hoodie is filled with high-tech insulation that releases heat during heavy cardio, so skiers can leave it on between high-intensity runs and chilly chairlift rides. It also packs into its own pocket to easily stash in a backpack or ski bag. </p>

      <p>It’s easy to start getting tired around 3 p.m. when you’ve been skiing hard (or falling hard) since 8 a.m. But since the Traveler Insulated Mug keeps drinks hot for 12 hours (and warm for more than that,) skiers can make coffee or hot chocolate in the morning and still have it piping hot for an afternoon caffeine boost when they return to the car after a day on the snow. And since it has a lockable, leak-proof lid, it won’t spill if it gets knocked over in the car on the way to the hill. The effective insulation makes it an equally lovely gift for early morning commuters or winter dog walkers.</p>
