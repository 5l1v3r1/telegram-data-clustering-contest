      <h1>Half Of Australian Kids Use A Mobile Phone</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Half of the Australian children aged 6 to 13 own or use a mobile phone, according to new research showing that kids are becoming increasingly more digital.</p>
      <p>Analysis of data from the <a href="https://www.acma.gov.au/articles/2019-11/almost-half-aussie-kids-own-or-use-mobile-phone"><u>Australian Communication and Media Authority</u></a> (ACMA) by Roy Morgan shows that in 2018, 32% of kids owned a mobile phone with another 16% having access to one, but not owning the phone.</p>
      <p>In fact, one in four kids between the ages of 6 and 7 had or used a mobile phone, bringing rise to an even more interconnected Australia.</p>
      <p>That being said, 52% of children neither own nor have access to a mobile phone.</p>

      <p>It comes as TCL enters into the kid’s smartwatch market with its <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/tcl-puts-a-200-smartwatch-on-the-kids/"><u>TCL MOVETIME Family Watch</u></a> (MT40) that allows for voice and video calling, GPS tracking and geofencing alerts for parental peace of mind.</p>
      <p>However, the MT40 is positioned as a compelling option for parents wanting to stay connected and monitor their children’s movements at a distance, without needing to give their child a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>ACMA Chair Nerida O’Loughlin said, ‘Australia is becoming a more connected society, and that trend is being driven by an increase in mobile devices, even amongst our children’.</p>
      <p>According to the research, girls had the most significant access to mobile phones, with 50% aged 6 to 13 owning or having access, compared to 46% of boys.</p>
      <p>NSW and the ACT had the highest access levels, with 52% of kids in both areas owning or having access to a mobile, up from 44% in 2013.</p>
      <p>To no one’s surprise, the most common use for mobile phones for kids is to play games, with 70% of children using a phone for video games alone.</p>
      <p>67% of children used phones to take photos, 57% used it for calling their parents or family, and 64% used other non-gaming apps.</p>
