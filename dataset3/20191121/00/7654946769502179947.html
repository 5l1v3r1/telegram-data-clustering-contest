      <h1>Cuomo’s disgraceful silence on the outrages at SUNY Binghamton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:52:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:52</time> by <a rel="author">Bob McManus</a></address>
      <p>It doesn’t take much to set off Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Bad weather, legislative impertinence, critics, President Trump, folks who make fun of his brother Chris and private university chancellors over whom he has no control — these are a few of Gov. Scowly-Face’s least favorite things. And he isn’t bashful about saying so.</p>
      <p>Take, for example, his sharp words for Syracuse University Chancellor Ken Syverud, following allegations of <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/syracuse-suspends-frat-activities-after-series-of-racist-anti-semitic-incidents/">on-campus white-supremacist trolling</a>: “The hateful activities at Syracuse University are most disturbing, not only to the Syracuse University community, but to the greater community of New York. They have not been handled in a manner that reflects this state’s aggressive opposition to such odious, reckless, reprehensible behavior.” Tough stuff.</p>
      <p>So one would think that Cuomo would speak similarly to the humiliations just visited on the State University’s Binghamton campus by a clutch of the usual suspects — barely post-adolescent fascisti who believe that what they don’t like, you better not like either. Or else.</p>
      <p>But one would be wrong. Cuomo, as of Wednesday, has had nothing to say about the fact that a venerable economist, Arthur Laffer,<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/to-protect-free-speech-suny-binghamton-must-throw-the-book-at-these-bullies/"> was run off one of the State University’s premier campuses </a>on the grounds that his supply-side theories are racist, or something.</p>
      <p>Imagine being so delicate as to be triggered by a revenue curve. But there you go. The pattern was ­familiar enough, routine even. It ­began last week, when protesters loudly mobbed fellow students who were attempting to advertise Laffer’s pending appearance. Tables containing promotional materials were overturned and pamphlets and buttons were trashed as campus police stood by quietly.</p>
      <p>Intervening, campus authorities explained, would escalate the tension. And this set the mood for Laffer’s appearance Monday night.</p>
      <p>Bullhorn-blaring students converged on a lecture hall and shouted down the speaker, who then departed under police escort — leaving protesters to preen, and more than a few citizens to wonder whether a great public university is worth the time, trouble and tax dollars necessary to support it.</p>
      <p>And there seems little doubt that Binghamton is on its way to greatness; one of its scholars just won a Nobel Prize for chemistry, a signal achievement for a backwater teachers college beefed up in 1946 to receive World War II vets returning to school on the GI Bill.</p>
      <p>But balance that with Binghamton’s shameful abandonment of Laffer, and with him any pretense of respect for free speech and inquiry.</p>
      <p>Even more damning has been the silence of Cuomo and others well-placed to make things right, and this goes a long way toward explaining the whole dismal affair. When it comes to bad behavior, ­societies get what they are willing to tolerate.</p>
      <p>It simply can’t be that the governor doesn’t know right from wrong here. He studied at the knee of his father, after all.</p>
      <p>Mario Cuomo had his faults — as do we all — but intellectual cowardice wasn’t among them. Indeed, his enduring opposition to the death penalty and heart-on-his-sleeve loyalty to an increasingly ­unpopular social agenda no doubt cost him his last election.</p>
      <p>He left office six weeks shy of 25 years ago, and a lot has changed since then. But it is impossible to imagine Mario Cuomo standing silent in the face of thuggery at Binghamton University or at any of SUNY’s 63 other campuses.</p>
      <p>Andrew Cuomo is another matter: He is not the only holder of high office in New York lacking the guts to address such things, but the best-positioned to do so. If only he could find the courage.</p>
      <p>To be sure, Wednesday the State University board, ostensibly an independent body but effectively a gubernatorial cat’s paw, had some vague words that may or may not have related to the incident.</p>
      <p>“Our institutions of higher learning are beacons of free speech, debate, expression, and discourse. These values are fundamental to our core mission … ” and so on and so forth, ending with the announcement of the inevitable task force.</p>
      <p>But the statement didn’t even mention Binghamton by name, which makes the statement a tedious whitewash and the promised task force just another hidey-hole for Andrew Cuomo.</p>
      <p>Dad would be so proud.</p>
