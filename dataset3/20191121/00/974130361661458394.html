      <h1>Joe Marler Has Just Given The Weirdest Interview In The History Of Rugby</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Aonghus Ó Maicín</a></address>
      <p>After stalling against Clermont Auvergne in France last weekend Harlequins will be hoping to get their Champions Cup campaign back on track on Saturday evening, where they'll be able to call upon Joe Marler again.</p>
      <p>Marler and his English teammates bale-d out of the opening round of the European competition after their Trojan efforts helping England reach a World Cup final in Japan.</p>
      <p>The loosehead prop is now hoping to saddle up again ahead of the visit of Bath to Twickenham Stoop on Saturday evening. However, he'll be jockeying for a starting position with Santiago Garcia Botta, the Argentinian who started last weekend, though he is expected to start. Marler's experience and ability ultimately offers the Premiership outfit a more stable front-row.</p>
      <p>When speaking to the club's in-house cameras, the 29-year-old was in stranger humour, offering quite the perspective ahead of the mane event this weekend.</p>

      <p>Nobody's doubting Marler's unbridled enthusiasm for storytelling but ahead of the weekend he'll need to quickly rein it in. Anything other than complete focus and determination against a Bath side also looking to rebound from a loss could result in another mare of an afternoon for the Londoners.</p>
