      <h1>Etv’s market share is growing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/jamie-mckane" target="_blank">Jamie McKane</a></address>
      <p>eMedia Holdings has released its interim results for the six months ended 30 September 2019, showing impressive profit and market share growth.</p>
      <p>The group ended the period with a profit from continuing operations of R102.1 million, an increase of 120% compared to the restated profit of R46.5 million in the previous period.</p>
      <p>eMedia added that the loss from discontinued operations amounted to R5.9 million for the six months, with revenue increasing by 6.6% despite tough economic conditions.</p>
      <p>“Included in the profit are the losses attributable to the continued investment into the multi-channel business (OpenView and Etv multi-channel) of R80.9 million compared to R84.3 million in the prior year,” the company said.</p>
      <p>The company said that box activations have continued to grow steadily, with 1,777,784 boxes currently activated.</p>
      <p>Etv has also seen impressive market share growth, increasing from 16.3% to 18.3%. The broadcaster’s advertising revenue has also seen a 4% improvement.</p>
      <p>“Management is reviewing the schedule in order to maximise slots that are currently unprofitable,” the company said.</p>
      <p>“July saw the launch of the new 18:30 drama series, Isipho, as well as the dubbed 17:30 Afrikaans telenovela. Initial ratings are encouraging for both time slots.”</p>
      <p>eNCA also continues to perform well and remains the most-watched 24-hour news station on DStv even though it is not on all the DStv bouquets.</p>
      <p>“eNCA has finished an intensive strategic restructuring process, which includes a new line-up, short-form branded content inserts and programmes,” eMedia added.</p>
