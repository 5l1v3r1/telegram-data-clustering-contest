      <p>WHILE some up and coming actress would not hesitate to flaunt their curves on social media with the hope of landing movie roles, actor Prince David Osei has asked such aspiring actresses to rather show off their talents instead.<br/><br/>For him, it was better for wanna-be actresses to boast of their talent than flaunt their bodies on social media since the former did not make a good actor.<br/><br/>“Every aspiring actor should be talented, work on the talent and make sure you are the master of your craft. That is the reason why even those with talents seek formal education to polish their craft. “This is because, the movie industry is choked with many talented actresses and so if your only focus is to flaunt your bodies to become a movie star, then you definitely have to look elsewhere,” Prince David stated. <br/><br/>While admonishing would-be actors to take their crafts more seriously, the Scorned actor said he doesn’t find it wrong for ladies to exchange sex for roles if they have the talent since the practice is common among humans. “Even though I don’t have evidence for these claims, I don’t think it is a big deal if two adults have consenting sex.<br/><br/>"Sex happens everywhere and the practice is not peculiar to the movie or entertainment sector. “Some ladies have exchanged sex for a bowl of fried rice, ice cream and some get payment for as low as GHC10 so if another wants to do it to secure a role, I don’t see anything wrong with it. "However, you should be talented so that you ride on that to achieve your target or dream as an actor", Prince David added.<br/><br/>Recently, Prince David was on the set of Famously Single, a new project by YN Productions owned by actress, Yvonne Nelson.<br/><br/>In July this year, he also grabbed the Best Actor (Lead Role) for the movie Last Night at the African International Film Festival Award 2019 in Dallas, USA and disclosed that he is working on new projects which will be out soon.<br/>Featured Video</p>
