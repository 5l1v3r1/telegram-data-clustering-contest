      <p>Ekuban after the training expressed delight with the progress he is making and declared that he can't wait to don the team's jersey again.</p>
      <p>"I miss the jersey to wear. As soon as possible to recover and I want to come back to our gorgeous fans. I had a hard time and very sad, but now it's all behind." said.</p>
      <p>He scored 5 goals in 7 matches and tallied 1 assist before the unfortunate injury.</p>
