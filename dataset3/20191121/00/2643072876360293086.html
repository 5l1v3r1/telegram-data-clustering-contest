      <h1>Lagos Government Explain Reason For Recent Heavy Traffic, Reveals What Would Be Done</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>Residents and motorists in Lagos have been urged to bear with it over serious traffic currently being experienced in several parts of the metropolis.</p>
      <p>The appeal was given by the Lagos State Government, through its Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Gbenga Omotoso.</p>
      <p>Omotoso in a statement, said the gridlock was as a result of massive road repairs being carried out by the government, saying the situation was temporal.</p>
      <p>He noted that the situation isnt a deliberate action to cause Lagosians any pain; the present situation is temporary.</p>
      <p>Omotosho added that the contractors are speeding up their jobs and they are being encouraged to work at night where possible, even as motorists are being advised to use alternative routes.</p>
      <p>He further assured that Lagosians discomfort would be short-lived as the state government has started to find solutions to the traffic.</p>
      <p>Omotosho noted that relevant agencies have been directed to review traffic control and regulation policies towards identifying a long-lasting remedy to the problem.</p>
      <p>“<i>The daily influx of people from other parts of the country into Lagos has contributed to the big human and vehicular pressure on the roads. The government will surely surmount the challenges with technology and enforcement of traffic rules.</i></p>
      <p><i>The Government appreciates the perseverance of Lagosians and pledges its commitment to pooling all its resources together to achieving a permanent solution to the problem posed by the rehabilitation of bad roads. The administration will ensure that majority of the roads become smooth and motorable before the Yuletide”</i> he said</p>
