      <h1>Just In: High Court Sacks Kano Emirs Installed By Ganduje</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>The High Court in Kano has on Thursday declared illegal the <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/05/06/ganduje-moves-to-break-kano-emirate-into-four/"><u><b>four emirate councils</b> </u></a>newly created by Governor <b>Abdullahi Ganduje</b>.</p>
      <p>Presiding Judge, Justice Usman N’aaba in nullifying the councils, held that the appointment of the four new Emirs, was illegal as the governor and state assembly failed to follow due process in the creation of the Emirates.</p>
      <p>Naija News <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/05/18/four-emirates-in-kano-state-the-issues-at-stake/"><u><b>recalls</b></u></a> that in May 2019, Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje had assented the bill seeking the establishment of four additional first-class Emirates – Rano, Gaya, Karaya and Bichiin – in Kano State following its passage by the Kano State House of Assembly.</p>
      <p>With reports ascribing the governor’s decision as a result of rift with <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/05/10/creation-of-four-kano-emirates-im-not-attacking-sanusi-ganduje/"><u><b>Emir Sanusi</b></u></a>, Ganduje said the move to create four emirates in Kano was not targeted at anyone but to “take Kano to the next level”.</p>
      <p>He later in the month presented letters of appointment to the four new first-class Emirs during a ceremony held at the state capital.</p>
      <p>Those presented with the letters of appointment include Aminu Ado Bayero, the son of Late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, as the Emir of Bichi; Ibrahim Abulkadir as the Emir of Gaya; Tafida Abubakar as the Emir Of Rano and Abubakar Ibrahim II as the Emir of Karaye.</p>
      <p>The creation of the new Emirates was however met with controversy as four Kano State kingmakers<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/05/20/kano-emirate-group-call-for-resignation-of-newly-elected-emirs/"><u><b> filed a suit against Ganduje</b> </u></a>and the State Assembly.</p>
