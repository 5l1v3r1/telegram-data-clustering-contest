      <p>Earlier this week Valve revealed it would be <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/354274/Valve_is_making_a_new_VR_HalfLife_game.php">revisiting one of its most iconic franchises</a> with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i></a>, a new chapter in the long-gestating <i>Half-Life </i>story that'll be told in VR.</p>
      <p>After giving fans a few days to get to grips with the news, the company has now shared even more details about the project, explaining the game will be a "full-length virtual reality entry" in the series.</p>
      <p>Slated for launch on Steam in March 2020, the title will be compatible with "all PC-based VR headsets" on day one, which seems like a sensible move designed to get the game into as many hands as possible.</p>
      <p>However, owners of Valve's own VR headset, the Valve Index, will be able to pick the game up for free while all other VR owners are stuck with the $60 price tag.</p>
      <p>"Set between the events of<i> Half-Life</i> and <i>Half-Life 2</i>, Alyx Vance and her father Eli secretly mount the resistance to the brutal occupation of Earth by a mysterious alien race known as The Combine. As Alyx, players take the fight to the Combine to save the future of humanity," explains a press release.</p>
      <p>"<i>Half-Life: Alyx </i>was designed from the ground up for Virtual Reality and features all of the hallmarks of a classic Half-Life game: world exploration, puzzle solving, visceral combat, and an intricately woven story that connects it all with the characters iconic to the <i>Half-Life </i>universe."</p>
      <p>While the project has quite rightly made headlines for being the first new entry in the series in around 12 years, it's also a notable return to game development for Valve, which has slowed down first-party production in recent times.</p>
      <p>Speaking about that return to the trenches, Valve founder Gabe Newell explained the prospect of working on an ambitious VR project reinvigorated the company.</p>
      <p>"VR has energized us. We’ve invested a lot of ourselves in the technology. But we're also game developers at heart, and to be devoting ourselves to a VR game this ambitious is just as exciting," he commented. "For that to come in the form of <i>Half-Life</i> feels like the culmination of a lot things we care a lot about: truly great games, cutting edge technology, and open platforms. We can’t wait for people to experience this."</p>
      <p>Valve also plans to <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/354549/Valve_releasing_Source_2_tools_alongside_HalfLife_Alyx_next_March.php">launch a set of Source 2 tools</a>, including an update to its level authoring tool Hammer, alongside <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> in March 2020.</p>
