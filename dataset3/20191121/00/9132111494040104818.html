      <p>A senior statesman and former local government administrator Ernest Asamoah Yaw has described as comic and unconscionable the conception of the Nana Akufo-Addo administration to construct a national shrine.</p>
      <p>The Minister of Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs Samuel Kofi Dzamesi has disclosed that a project of the sort was being seriously considered on the request of some traditional priests.</p>
      <p>The minister told the media yesterday in Accra that the demand would not be out of order, as muslims have a national mosque with a national cathedral in the offing.</p>
      <p>The minister’s disclosure has however irked the passionate septuagenarian who could not hold back any punches, describing the president Nana Akufo-Addo and his ministers as acting in the manner of “comedians” using his dear country as a theatrical stage.”</p>
      <p>“Unbelievable, Unbelievable, unbelievable, the Ghana government is considering building this? These people are comedians. Do they understand what a shrine means,” the clearly shocked man quizzed.</p>
      <p>According to Mr Asamoah Yaw, the last thing any government of a country like Ghana with all its pressing needs should think about is building of such relics for religious activities.</p>
      <p>He fumed, “They are not so concerned about the public need. Our hospitals don’t have equipments. The materials are not available. Roads are messed up; schools are messed up everything name it is messed up in the country and the people who we have elected to govern us are not thinking of anything tangible to improve the nation rather they are going to build a shrine. No I cannot believe this. It cannot be true. These people are a bunch of comedians. I can’t believe it.”</p>

      <p>The heartbroken Yaw Asamoah told host of the Ultimate Breakfast Show Julius Caesar Anadem, he has regretted voting for Nana Akufo-Addo in the 2016 elections that brought him to power.</p>
      <p>Our president......I am trying to find the right word to describe him. Our president is not correct. I voted for him too. He got my vote. I didn’t think he was coming to be my leader with idea of God God God, spirit spirit spirit. If I asked him to explain what GOD means I am sure he wouldn’t understand what G.O.D. means... This man is misplaced and all his leaders and people he is ruling the country are all misplaced.”</p>
      <p>He insisted that the world has moved on from the antiquated age of spirits’ and is now hinged on critical thinking which brings solutions to societal problems of humanity.</p>
