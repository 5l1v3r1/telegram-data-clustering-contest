      <p>Gearbox has put <a href="https://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/borderlands-3-patch-and-hotfix-11-21-2019/4127376">out the patch notes</a> for the <i>Borderlands 3</i> Maliwan Takedown update, which just went live, and while that raid-like activity, its new loot, the new Mayhem 4 mode and 300 vault slots are going to be the talk of the hour, I wanted to highlight what <i>else</i> was coming with the patch, namely a whole bunch of buffs the <i>Borderlands 3</i> community has been asking for for a while. And no nerfs! Unless something breaks! Which is possible!Anyway, we will start with Moze, whose poor mech Iron Bear has gone forgotten at higher difficulty levels pretty much since Borderlands 3 came out. Here’s the list of changes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iron Bear Damage increased per level, to a total of just under 150% at max level</li>
        <li>Desperate Measures now gives Iron Bear the bonus too</li>
        <li>Experimental Munitions - Iron Bear also deals bonus fire damage on critical hits</li>
        <li>Scorching RPM’s also grants increased Hard Point damage by 5% per level</li>
        <li>Vampyr - When Iron Bear deals area damage, Iron Bear receives half the healing bonus</li>
        <li>Iron Bear now launches barrels when the player melees them</li>
        <li>Increased Iron Bear Bubble Shield from 20% to 50% of Moze’s health</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A base damage increase is a nice bump, and it’s more than double at level 50, which is fantastic. Desperate Measures is the perk that gives you increased damage when your health is low, and that now applies to the mech too which can be a big post. The rest of these are perks that now apply to Iron Bear when they didn’t previously like lifesteal or incendiary damage, so at least in theory, it sounds a lot more viable to use your mech in endgame combined with the past life boost and current damage boost. Not bad. Moze is my console main, so I’ll try her out soon.</p>

      <p>And here’s our boy Zane, who has been lagging behind most of the other vault hunters for ages. But now he could be pretty strong after all this, we’ll have to see.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SNTL damage scale increased by 2% per level</li>
        <li>Donnybrook, Pocket Full of Grenades, Cool Hand, Violent Violence, and Violent Speed bonuses now stack twice</li>
        <li>Fixed Violent Momentum to scale more at higher movement speeds</li>
        <li>Best Served Cold radius and damage increased by 2% per level</li>
        <li>Confident Confidence increased max weapon damage bonus from 20% to 35%</li>
        <li>Changed Trick of the Light element to Cryo and increased bonus from 18% to 36%</li>
        <li>Borrowed Time duration increased from 15% to 30% per active skill</li>
        <li>Double Barrel 's bonus increased from 20% to 25%</li>
        <li>Quick Breather now restores 50% of the clone’s health after a swap</li>
        <li>Pocket Full of Grenades bonus slightly decreased from 6.5% to 5% as it now stacks</li>
        <li>Violent Violence bonus slightly decreased from 4% to 3% as it now stacks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There’s a lot to process there, and I’m not sure what the bonuses stacking for that initial batch of skills “stacks twice” means. Are the total stacks doubling? Are the values doubling? Anyway it sounds good. I am looking at Borrowed Time which should <i>really</i> increase your action skill length now by doubling its bonus. Some buffs to clone health (on switch) and SNTL damage too. Looking forward to seeing how he plays now. I wish he got some changes to his class mods which are mostly bad, but whatever.</p>

      <p>Now, time for some FL4K pet buffs, which everyone has been waiting for for <i>so</i> long:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ambush Predator now has a HUD Icon when the buff is active</li>
        <li>Increased the pet damage to scale 10/5% per level instead of 9%</li>
        <li>Added pet damage to Grim Harvest at 7% per level</li>
        <li>Added pet damage to The Most Dangerous Game at 9% per level</li>
        <li>Added pet damage to Interplanetary Stalker at 1% per stack, per level</li>
        <li>Added pet damage to Furious Attack at 0.6% per stack</li>
        <li>Added pet damage to The Fast and the Furryous at 10% per level</li>
        <li>Lick the Wounds gained a pet damage buff after reviving the player</li>
        <li>Increased pet damage for Psycho Head on a Stick from 10% to 20%</li>
        <li>Increased damage in Pack Tactics from 5% to 7% per level</li>
        <li>Adjusted Megavore to not reward critical hit bonuses when receiving damage from self-damage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So, to sum up, a whole bunch of skills now reward stacking pet damage for specing into them. Like, literally everything on this list almost has a pet damage buff to it. Combine a bunch of these together and maybe FL4K’s pets will be…good…now? We can only hope. I really want this Super Scag build to work. One thing I am noticing is that the pets aren’t receiving any further health bumps, which I still think is kind of important for higher difficulties, but I guess we’ll see what it all looks like in practice. I’m excited.</p>
      <p>And finally, AMARA!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nothing</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A lot to go through here, but I can’t wait to test it all out. Big day, big day.</p>
