      <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/companies/hartford-financial-services/"><b>Hartford Financial</b></a><b> (NYSE: HIG)</b> is global insurance giant that provides life Property &amp; Casualty Insurance, Group Life Insurance and Mutual Fund services to its clients. Trefis estimates <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/m5ohVAk5/Hartford-Financial-Valuation-Expensive-or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=hig191121"><b>Hartford Financial’s valuation</b></a> to be $64 per share, which is 5% ahead of the current market price. Our price estimate takes into account <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/gV6CGxKO/Hartford-Financial-Earnings-Performance-and-2019-Forecast?fromforbesandarticle=hig191121"><b>Hartford Financial’s earnings</b></a> beat for the third quarter, where it reported total revenues of $5.3 billion – up 10% y-o-y – thanks to a 26%-jump in Commercial Property &amp; Casualty (P&amp;C) premiums and 10% growth in net investment income, partially offset by declines in Personal P&amp;C premiums and Mutual Funds &amp; Corporate revenues.We have detailed the key components of <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/m5ohVAk5/Hartford-Financial-Valuation-Expensive-or-Cheap-?fromforbesandarticle=hig191121"><b>Hartford Financial’s valuation</b></a> in an interactive dashboard, along with our forecast for the full year 2019.</p>

        <i>Stock Price = (Total revenue x Net income margin / No. of shares outstanding) x P/E Ratio</i>

      </related>
      <ul>
        <li>Total revenues have increased 19% over the last 4 years, from $16 billion in 2015 to $19 billion in 2018.</li>
        <li>We expect Hartford Financial to report $20.3 billion in Total Revenues for 2019, which is 7% more than the previous year.</li>
        <li>This growth would be driven by an 8% y-o-y rise in Group Life Insurance revenues followed by a 6% jump in Property &amp; Casualty (P&amp;C) segment revenues.</li>
        <li>Also, Mutual Funds &amp; Corporate segment is expected to increase by 14% y-o-y in 2019.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We capture <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/lNQdBhbP/Hartford-Financial-Revenues-How-Does-Hartford-Financial-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=hig191121"><b>the factors that have driven changes in revenues of Hartford Financial’s segments over recent years along with our forecast for the next three years</b></a> in an interactive dashboard.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Better Operating Margin And Higher Revenues Should Boost The Net Income Figure</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Although Hartford Financial is expected to have a Net Income of $1.9 billion in 2019 – which is 6% more than the previous year – net interest margin would decrease by 7 bps to 9.4%.</li>
        <li>This decrease in Net Interest Margin would be due to higher expected Tax Rate as compared to the previous year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>This Lends Support To A $64 Price Estimate For Hartford Financial’s Shares</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hartford Financial has regularly invested in share repurchases to boost shareholder returns. Its share repurchase is likely to touch $340 million for full-year 2019.</li>
        <li>Lower outstanding shares coupled with a higher Net Income figure should result in Hartford’s EPS figure increasing to $5.44 in 2019.</li>
        <li>Using a 11.8x P/E Multiple on expected 2019 EPS of $5.44, this works out to our price estimate of $64 for <a href="https://dashboards.trefis.com/no-login-required/5VwQgxlI/Hartford-Financial-Stock-NYSE-HIG-?fromforbesandarticle=hig191121">Hartford Financial’s Stock</a></li>
