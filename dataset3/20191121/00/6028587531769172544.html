      <p><b>Topline:</b> Lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee are promoting a “fictional narrative” that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/fiona-hill-say-partisan-politics-drove-fictional-narrative-ukraine-n1088221">according to</a> former White House official Fiona Hill, who warns that Russia is gearing up to interfere in the 2020 race.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hill, considered one of the top U.S. experts on Russian president Vladimir Putin, made her comments as part of her <a href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2019/11/2019-11-21-Fiona-Hill-Opening-Statement-FINAL3.pdf">opening statement</a> for Thursday’s public impeachment hearing.</li>
        <li>She targeted some of the panel’s lawmakers: “Some of you on this committee appear to believe that Russia” did not interfere in the 2016 election and that “somehow, for some reason, Ukraine did.”</li>
        <li>Hill is likely referring to Republican committee members, who have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/11/13/us/politics/ap-us-trump-impeachment-fact-check.html">repeatedly questioned</a> other witnesses about Ukraine’s alleged efforts to undermine President Trump during the 2016 election.</li>
        <li>The theory that Ukraine interfered in 2016 is, however, a widely <a href="https://apnews.com/23c9022665dc40a1a69e613459955112">debunked conspiracy theory</a>.</li>
        <li>Further <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-has-won-mueller-report-details-the-ways-russia-interfered-in-the-2016-election-11555666201">backing up</a> Hill’s comments is Robert Mueller’s report from March which unequivocally found that Russian interfered to help Trump in the 2016 election, a view <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-continues-attacks-on-intelligence-agencies-ahead-of-classified-briefing-on-russia-1483728966?mod=article_inline">unanimously held</a> by the intelligence community. </li>
        <li>Hill’s hearing—in which she’s joined by the U.S. embassy’s Ukraine political affairs counselor, David Holmes⁠—is the last public impeachment hearing before Congress recesses for Thanksgiving.  </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote:</b> “I refuse to be part of an effort to legitimize an alternate narrative that the Ukrainian government is a U.S. adversary, and that Ukraine—not Russia—attacked us in 2016,” reads her statement.</p>
      <p><b>What to watch for:</b> If House intel chair Adam Schiff calls for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/21/778657384/what-to-watch-for-in-impeachment-hearing-with-fiona-hill-david-holmes">more public hearings</a>. If he does, it would likely take the impeachment inquiry into early 2020. </p>
      <p><b>Key background: </b>Hill, a naturalized American born in the U.K., was a member of the White House Security Council until she departed in July. She delivered closed-door testimony on October 14, in which she said that EU ambassador Gordon Sondland had told Ukrainian officials that their president, Volodymr Zelensky, would be granted a White House visit if they publicly announced investigations into President Trump’s political rivals. Sondland confirmed during his Wednesday marathon hearing that the arrangement, a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisettevoytko/2019/11/20/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-says-pence-and-pompeo-knew-about-ukraine-pressure-campaign/">“quid pro quo</a>,” did in fact exist. </p>
      <p><b>News peg</b>: House Democrats have launched an impeachment inquiry into Trump’s actions in response to a July phone call between Trump and Zelensky. On the call, Trump directed Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter for corruption. Trump and Rudy Giuliani claim that during the Obama presidency then-vice president Biden pushed for the resignation of Ukraine’s top prosecutor in an effort to quash an investigation into Burisma Holdings, where Hunter Biden had a board seat.</p>
