      <p>In response to the growing number of businesses operating between Turkey and Qatar, KPMG in Qatar recently launched its ‘Turkish desk’ to provide tailored services to clients from both countries. Last week, they held their first major event in Istanbul.</p>
      <p>The ‘Turkey-Qatar Trade and Investment Opportunities’ seminar took place on November 13 at Fairmont Quasar hotel in Istanbul, and covered a number of topics relating to the ease of doing business in Qatar as well as the opportunities for Qatari companies investing in Turkey.</p>
      <p>“Qatar’s economy has a stable growth and with its world class infrastructure and human capital development it continues to offer new opportunities to investors”, said Venkat Krishnaswamy, Advisory Partner at KPMG Qatar.</p>
      <p>Fahad Al Kuwari, Middle East &amp; Tukey Market head at Qatar Free Zones Authority, who attended the seminar representing the Qatari businesses perspective, commented:</p>
      <p>“We have established strong business partnerships and relationships with many countries in the region through our financial centre and free zones. Turkish companies can now easily benefit from the investment friendly policies. We are proud to see an increase in the number of Turkish companies operating in our country.”</p>
      <p>Barbara Henzen, Partner, Head of Tax &amp; Corporate Services at KPMG Qatar, stated:</p>
      <p>”New regulations have made it possible to establish a company in Qatar with 100 percent foreign capital, which is an advantage for investors. “Qatar continues to offer attractive opportunities for many sectors, with targets set in line with their 2030 vision. In particular, the companies operating in the construction, technology and manufacturing sectors are offered various investment opportunities. Turkish companies will certainly keep Qatar on their radar.”</p>
      <p>The seminar was attended by more than 90 executives from Turkey-based businesses that are interested to invest or expand to Qatar and to strengthen their own businesses by finding new and innovative suppliers and partnerships.</p>
