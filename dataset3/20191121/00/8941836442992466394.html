      <p>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus police say 120 Syrian migrants have been housed at a reception center after arriving from Turkey aboard a boat.</p>
      <p>Police said Thursday that the 97 men, 20 children - including 14 unaccompanied minors - and three women told authorities they each paid people traffickers $4,000 (3,620 euros) for a spot on the boat.</p>
      <p>Their vessel was spotted Wednesday sailing off Cape Greco on the southeastern tip of the island nation and was escorted to an area harbor.</p>
      <p>The migrants said they set sail from Turkey’s southern port city of Mersin after crossing the Syrian-Turkish border on separate dates.</p>

        <p>Cyprus officials say a migrant influx is taxing the small country’s ability to host so many arrivals and is asking fellow European Union member states to share the burden.</p>
