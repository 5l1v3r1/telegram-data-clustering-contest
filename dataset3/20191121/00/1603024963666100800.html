        <b>Valuation and Outlook</b>
      </p>
      <p>CSBâ€™s performance has not been encouraging in the past with rise in NPA level. However, new promoter and strong management brings capital and execution strength on the table which bodes well for future growth as well as earnings. Therefore, we assign a <b>SUBSCRIBE</b> recommendation to the stock. Further, at the IPO price band of Rs 193-195, the stock is available at a P/BV of ~2.2x at the upper band on H1FY20 basis.</p>
