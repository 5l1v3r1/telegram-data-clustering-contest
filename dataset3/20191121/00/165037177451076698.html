        <b>Former Arsenal player, Martin Keown, gave his opinion about two subjects that, in his mind, have something in common: Mauricio Pochettino's sacking and Arsenal's current situation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Keown, a name a lot of people respect in 'Gunners' history, the Argentine would be the ideal option for <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal</a>, which is currently managed by Spanish coach, <b>Unai Emery.</b></p>
      <p>"I think that the club <b>must consider hiring Pochettino.</b> We are not having the best of seasons," he said in statements collected by the 'Daily Mail'.Â </p>
