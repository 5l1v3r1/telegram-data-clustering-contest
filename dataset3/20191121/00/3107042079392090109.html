      <h1>Sex with Skantha: 'I would not do that'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/rob.kidd%40odt.co.nz" target="_blank">Rob Kidd</a></address>
      <p>A witness has told a court how a Dunedin doctor twice offered a teenage girl money for sex – just weeks before he allegedly murdered her.</p>
      <p>Venod Skantha (32) is accused of fatally stabbing 16-year-old Amber-Rose Rush in the bedroom of her Corstorphine home on February 2 last year and has spent nearly three weeks on trial in the High Court at Dunedin.</p>
      <p>The Crown says the defendant killed the teen because she had threatened to go to his hospital bosses with sexual allegations, which would have effectively ended his medical career.</p>
      <p>A 16-year-old boy – whose name was suppressed because of his age – told the court Skantha first made an offer of $400 to have sex with Amber-Rose while they drove from her house to his.</p>
      <p>“Amber seemed to pass it off as a joke; so so did I,” he said.</p>
      <p>Things, however, took a more serious turn at the defendant's Fairfield property.</p>
      <p>The witness said within a few minutes of being back, Skantha increased his financial offer to have the victim sleep with him.</p>
      <p>Incrementally, the price allegedly reached $20,000.</p>
      <p>Skantha, he said, sounded serious though it was unclear whether the offer was legitimate.</p>
      <p>“I thought of it as more: he's really adamant of having sex with her; the price not so much,” the boy told the jury.</p>
      <p>He said his friend took offence immediately.</p>
      <p>“I can recall Amber say 'eww, f*** off, I would not do that',” the teenager said.</p>
      <p>“Vinny told her to get the f*** out of his house.” </p>
      <h3>Groping, throat-slitting threat alleged</h3>
      <p>Melissa Severins, who was dating Skantha's flatmate, recalled a party in 2017 when the defendant gave “some powdery stuff” to two women.</p>
      <p>They snorted the substance, the witness said, and one of them soon passed out on the couch.</p>
      <p>She conceded under cross-examination, she could not see exactly see what Skantha was doing with his hand because it happened under a blanket.</p>
      <p>“He had his hand under the blanket, aimed towards her vagina and then said to everyone he's a doctor and knows what he's doing. Basically everyone could hear her moaning,” the woman said.</p>
      <p>She said she then went to bed.</p>
      <p>One of the teen girls who had been on the couch gave evidence that she remembered nothing about such an incident.</p>
      <p>However, she told the court she and her friend had later ended up in Skantha's bed where he performed a sex act on her.</p>
      <p>“[My friend] was beside me and at one point he tried to reach over to her to pull down her undies and I said 'just leave her' and he did,” the witness said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Melissa's mother Tracey Severins told the jury she met Skantha on the dating app Tinder in September 2017.</p>
      <p>Despite that, the woman, who was in her mid-40s, said she saw herself as a “mum figure” to the defendant and the people who visited his South Dunedin flat.</p>
      <p>Within months, she said, Skantha gave her $40 or $60 to get him drugs.</p>
      <p>“I didn't get the drugs. I thought he didn't really need it because he was always drunk,” Tracey Severins said.</p>
      <p>She said his reaction was extreme.</p>
      <p>“Vinny was in the lounge drinking. I went out to make a coffee in the kitchen and he came towards me. He looked really quite angry, started pushing me and then he slammed me up against the wall,” the woman said.</p>
      <p>“He just came right up to my face and said 'where's my effing drugs?'”</p>
      <p>Tracey Severins said her daughter Melissa saw what was happening and intervened.</p>
      <p>The younger woman allegedly “abused him and went mental” over what was happening.</p>
      <p>“Go get my machete so I can slit this bitch's throat,” Skantha allegedly said.</p>
      <p>The weapon was not used but both women said she had seen it brandished before.</p>
      <p>“He did pull it out one night when I was there. It just freaked me out anyway, seeing it. He was quite proud of it,” Tracey Severins said.</p>
      <p>Skantha, she said, “thought he was a ninja”.</p>
      <p>Under cross-examination, Tracey Severins confirmed to Jonathan Eaton QC she thought the defendant was capable of using the weapon.</p>
      <p>“He wanted to kill people,” she said.</p>
      <p>She described how Skantha was always drinking and there were constantly social gatherings at the flat.</p>
      <p>She told the jury she gradually pulled away from the relationship after the machete incident.</p>
      <p>“As he drunk more and took more drugs, he became different. He was an arsehole,” she said.</p>
      <p>The trial continues. </p>
