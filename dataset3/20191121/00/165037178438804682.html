        <b>Whilst Patrick Kluivert sees it best that Ansu Fati plays in the Barca B team if he is not going to have any minutes in the first team, the decision falls to Ernesto Valverde, who sees a more than valid player in him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was really difficult to maintain the level shown in his first few appearances with <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Injuries and a lack of game time in the last few weeks have taken their toll on him. He returned to the scene against Celta, but did not perform to the expected level.<b> But Valverde will have patience with him.</b></p>
      <p><b>This is not enough for Kluivert,</b> who already stated that a young man like him must have minutes. "If all the first team players are well,<b> I have the feeling that he has to play in the Barce B team to get game time,"</b> the director of the youth squad said.</p>
      <p>The truth is that Valverde cannot rely on him when he so many other options in attack, <b>(Luis Suarez, Leo Messi, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele)</b>. For this, the coach knows that <b>Ansu Fati adds value to the squad.</b></p>

      </ul>
      <p>For this reason, from the club, as 'AS' states, they have also seen with good eyes that<a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/a-fati-776260/"> Ansu Fati</a> did not go to the <b>U-17 World Cup in Brazil. </b>To have opportunities with Barca they believe that it enriches the footballer a lot more.</p>
      <p>He was even ahead of Antoine Griezmann with all the available troops, although the striker<b> seems to have lost steam</b>. Not in the mind of Valverde, who will continue to count on him.</p>
      <p>It only remains to see if he will be given more of a chance or not in the Barca first team, as <b>Valverde needs to have confidence in him and note that he will come good again. </b></p>
