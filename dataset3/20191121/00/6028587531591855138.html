      <h1>Samsung Confirms New Galaxy’s Faster Features</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Ewan Spence</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a> continues to test its new user interface, and hiding in some code is a reference to an impressive upgrade. The latest public beta of ‘<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/14/samsung-galaxy-s10-android-10-one-ui-camera-gestures-dark-mode-upgrade/">One UI 2</a>’ reveals an option for a screen to run at 120Hz.</p>
      <p>Faster screens are proving to be attractive option for manufacturers looking to improve the user experience. In data to day use, a faster refresh offers smoother scrolling, snappier transitions, and a subtle feeling of speed and performance. And it opens up a far more immersive experience for smartphone gamers.</p>
      <p>A number of premium Android handsets sported 90Hz screens during 2019, and key gaming handsets such as the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2018/12/15/razer-phone-2-review-android-gaming-smartphone/">Razer Phone 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/asus-rog-phone-2">Asus ROG Phone 2</a> clock in at 120Hz.</p>
      <p><a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/19/galaxy-s11-leaks-vs-iphone-12-higher-refresh-rate-displays-rumored/">Samsung’s move to faster screens</a> will not only benefit the upcoming handsets, it will also give Samsung’s Display division a new product to sell to other manufacturers looking to pick up the latest technology. With the iPhone 12 expected to move to a 120Hz screen next year, a larger order from Apple could well be on the horizon for the South Koreans. </p>

      <p>The One UI beta has already proven to be a happy hunting ground for those looking out for upcoming features in Samsung’s 2020 portfolio. The 120 Hz screen detailed above can now join the discovery of increased exposure time and higher ISO values in the camera <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/28/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-iso-exposure-one-ui-beta-confirmed-specs">to facilitate better low light photography</a>.</p>
      <p>I do not expect every new handset from Samsung to use every single feature One UI feature but the flagship handsets such as the upcoming Galaxy S11 family, which is expected to be announced in February 2020, are key candidates for faster screens and improved cameras.</p>
