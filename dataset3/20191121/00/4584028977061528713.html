      <h1>San Juan crowned East champions for a fourth straight time, Speyside claim first Tobago title</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sportsmax.tv/index.php/studentwriters/itemlist/user/803-paulandrewalker" target="_blank">Paul-Andre Walker</a></address>
      <p>San Juan North Secondary were crowned champions of the East for the fourth time in a row after a 3-1 win over St Augustine Secondary in the Coca-Cola Intercol zonal final at the Larry Gomes Stadium in Malabar on Thursday.</p>
      <p>San Juan, who were winning their fifth title in the last six years, had to wait until the 65<sup>th</sup> minute before Tyrique Sutherland put them ahead and Daniel Best made the title certain with a 72nd-minute goal. Earlier, Jamal Olliviere was the unfortunate man from St Augustine to start his team on the back foot, scoring an own goal in the 21<sup>st</sup> minute. In the first minute of time added on to the first half, Jardel John equalled the scores, making a real game of the contest.</p>
      <p>In the other Intercol final on the day, the battle for Tobago at the Dwight Yorke Stadium, Speyside High School were crowned champions.</p>
      <p>Speyside had not won the title in four years but were assured in a 3-1 over Signal Hill Secondary thanks to a brace from Nicholas Sanches.</p>
      <p>Sanchesâ€™ two goals were bolstered by a Signal Hill own goal, while the eventual losers got onto the scoresheet thanks to a goal from Hamilton Bristol.</p>
      <p>That result means Speyside will now have to turn their attention to the North Zone Intercol champions in the National Intercol quarterfinals on Tuesday, November 26 at the Haseley Crawford Stadium in Port of Spain.</p>
      <p>San Juan North Secondary, on the other hand, head to the Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva where they take on Central Zone champions Carapichaima East Secondary in the National Intercol semi-final on Friday, August 29.</p>
