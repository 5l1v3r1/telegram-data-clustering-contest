      <p>The Committee set up to probe Prof. Ransford Gyampo and Paul Butakor, over their alleged involvement in the BBC Sex For Grades Documentary, has found prima facie evidence of breaches of the University of Ghana (UG) code of conduct by the two lecturers.</p>
      <p>The two senior lecturers were interdicted in October 2019, after they were captured in the BBC’s African Eye documentary which sought to expose sexual misconduct in universities across West Africa.</p>
      <p>The Committee has therefore recommended that the matter be brought before the University’s Disciplinary Committee.</p>
      <p>This was contained in a statement issued by Stella A. Amoa, Director of Public Affairs, UG.</p>
      <p>According to the statement, the Committee chaired by Justice Vida Akoto-Bamfo, a retired Supreme Court judge, noted in its report to the Vice Chancellor that there was prima facie evidence of misconduct against Prof. Gyampo and Dr. Butakor, contrary to paragraph 6.4 of the Code of Conduct for Academic Staff of the University of Ghana, which stipulates that Academic Staff shall at all times comport themselves in ways that will enhance their image and that of the University.</p>
      <p>It added that the Committee further found prima facie evidence of misconduct contrary to Statute 42(1) (e) (ii) of the University of Ghana which states that “no member of the University shall engage in a course of vexatious conduct that is directed at one or more specific individuals, and that is known to be unwelcome.”</p>
      <p>It noted that the Vice Chancellor has accepted the Committee’s findings and forwarded to the Disciplinary Committee.</p>
