      <h1>Somali-Canadian activist Almaas Elman killed in Mogadishu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:46:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:46</time> by <a rel="author">The Canadian Press, Staff</a></address>
      <p>The Somali government says a Somali-Canadian human rights activist and diplomat has been killed.</p>
      <p>The Somali ministry of information says Almaas Elman was murdered in the capital city of Mogadishu.</p>
      <p>The government said in a tweet that it is investigating and will bring those responsible to justice.</p>
      <p>A Global Affairs Canada spokeswoman said the department was prepared to help the family.</p>
      <p>"Our deepest thoughts and sympathies are with the family and friends of the Canadian citizen who died in a shooting in Somalia," Natasha Nystrom said in an email Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Consular officials stand ready to provide consular services to the family."</p>
      <p>She said consular officials in Kenya are in contact with local authorities to gather additional information.</p>
      <p>Nystrom said due to the Privacy Act no further information would be disclosed.</p>
      <p>Toronto Liberal MP Ahmed Hussen, minister of Families, Children and Social Development, expressed his condolences to Elman's family.</p>
      <p>"Canadian humanitarian workers put themselves at risk around the world to help others," he said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"This is why I'm truly saddened by the death of Almaas Elman, a Somali Canadian human rights worker who was killed in Mogadishu.</p>
      <p>"I extend my prayers to the Elman family."</p>
      <p>Hussen has served as national president of the Canadian Somali Congress.</p>
      <p>Media reports in Somalia say Elman was shot in her vehicle while heading to the airport.</p>
      <p>She was involved with the Elman Centre for Peace and Human Rights in Mogadishu, a non-governmental agency founded by her family in 1990.</p>
      <p>Her sister, Ilwad Elman, made international headlines in October when she was short-listed for the Nobel Peace Prize for her work with the Elman Centre.</p>
      <p>The centre is named after her father, Elman Ali Ahmed, a peace activist who was killed in Somalia in 1996.</p>
      <p>The centre's website says after his death her mother brought her daughters to Canada so they could grow up in safety.</p>
