      <h1>Xiaomi Mi Band 3i arrives in India with no heart-rate tracking, super low price</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=32" target="_blank">Yordan</a></address>
      <p>Xiaomi has just launched the Mi Band 3i, which is specifically designed for the Indian market. The device looks exactly like the regular Mi Band 3, but lacks a heart-rate sensor that usually is on the back of the device. This allows Xiaomi to sell the Mi Band 3i at an impressively low price of INR1,299, which is just $18.</p>

      <p>Beyond that there's no difference between the Mi Band 3i and the Mi Band 3. It still has an AMOLED screen with a 0.78” black and white display and a resolution of 128 x 80 pixels. The capacitive button below allows adds another way to control the UI, while the back features two Pogo Pins for charging.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi did a great job covering the fact there is no heart-rate sensor - the company has photos only from the front or onto a person’s wrist. It has all the other features like sleep tracking, idle alert, app notifications, locating or unlocking your phone, as well as the gentle vibrating alarm - you simply forget you need the HR sensor.</p>

      <p>Since the phone is part of the Mi ecosystem, it pairs with the phone through Bluetooth 4.2 and on the Mi Fit app all the data collected is provided in a neat way that is both easy to read and pleasing to the eye.</p>
      <p>The Xiaomi Mi Band 3i is available for purchase with free shipping, with an estimated delivery time ranging from 2 to 5 days, depending on the location.</p>
