      <p>One of the medical practitioners who pushed for the removal of the new director general of the Ghana Health Service has claimed he did not go through due process to secure the job.</p>
      <p>Dr Baffour Awuah who was appointed by the President on November 5, 2019 has had his appointment withdrawn days after some health workers claiming to be members of the ruling party petitioned the President over his loyalty to the NPP.</p>
      <p>“We the health fraternity and true party members of NPP would like to draw the presidents attention to this greatest mistake NPP can ever make in health, so is the party saying no faithful member is qualified enough to occupy the position of Director General-GHS after Dr Nsia Asare other than Dr Baffour Awuah we all know his party affiliations and biases, what happened to we have the men mantra we have always shouted.</p>
      <p>“So the NPP government led by Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo Addo is telling the well-meaning Health workers who sacrificed everything and went against all odds that their efforts don’t deserve a reward by appointing a true party person to steer the affairs of this important office in health and take over from Dr Anthony “Drone” Nsia Asare,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>The withdrawal of his appointment has been condemned by many Ghanaians including some members of Parliament.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Francis Abban on the Morning Starr , the executive director of Africa Centre for Health Dr. Thomas Anaba said they resisted the appointment because it was wrongly done.</p>
      <p>“Dr. Awuah did not go through the due process. We didn’t see any advert. If we are protesting, it’s because something has gone wrong. Personally, I do not care if he is NDC or NPP but the due process must be followed. If we do not correct this error now, positions in the public service will be done on political lines and that will cause more harm in the future. Most appointments in the health service are done based on political lines. Let’s not see these things happen because it’s dangerous,” he said.</p>
