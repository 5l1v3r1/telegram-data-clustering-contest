      <p>Valve has been on a bit of an update spree of late: after years of torment, Half-Life 2 NPCs <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/half-life-2-npcs-can-finally-blink-after-years-of-torment/">can finally blink again</a> thanks to a recent fix. Now it's Portal 2's turn, and while the improvements and fixes aren't quite as weird, they are probably more useful.</p>
      <p>The biggest fix comes in the way of new local cooperative tweaks. It's now easier to have one player on a controller and another on mouse and keyboard, which was previously only possible with a few workarounds. Local coop support is now available from the community coop map queue, too.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, with the newly released Remote Play Together functionality, it's possible to play split-screen Portal 2 with a remote Player 2 who doesn't even own the game. That's not in the patch notes, but it's worth making note of. Portal 2 has online cooperative support, but both people need to own the game.</p>
      <p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/56268/">full patch notes</a>:</p>
      <p><b>Windows</b><br/>- Fixed an issue where in-game audio caption language would use the system language setting instead of the Steam language setting.<br/><br/><b>Controller support</b><br/>- Improved camera control through Steam Input – the sensitivity scale has changed so you may need to increase your configuration’s sensitivity.<br/>- Add local coop support for one controller player and one Mouse/Keyboard player.<br/>- Add local coop support from the community coop map queue. Quickplay is still not supported.<br/>- Fix XInput related options being hidden when connecting a Steam Input enabled controller using a Gamepad configuration.<br/>- Fix the challenge mode screen not having enough footer buttons available through Steam Input.<br/>- Fix several more bugs where the incorrect action set could be set in Steam Input.<br/>- Fix several cases where having a controller connected but not active would affect the glyphs and settings screen options.</p>
