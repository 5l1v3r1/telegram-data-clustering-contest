      <h2>Trying to maximise upside without protecting the downside is a recipe for disaster.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Rahul Shah</a></address>
      <p>I follow 3 gurus in the world of investing: Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.equitymaster.com/timeless-reading/15/benjamin-graham-deep-value-stocks">Benjamin Graham</a> was called <i>The Dean of Wall Street</i>. This is what he believed investing was all about...</p>
      <p>
        <i>An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and a satisfactory return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.</i>
      </p>
      <p>He put safety before return. He gave more priority to protecting the investment corpus than trying to earn big returns on it.</p>
      <p>And these are <a href="https://www.equitymaster.com/outlook/warren-buffett/warren-buffett-value-investing.asp">Warren Buffett’s two rules for investing</a>…</p>
      <p>
        <i>Rule No.1: Never lose money.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Rule No.2: Never forget rule No.1</i>
      </p>
      <p>The greatest investor in the world also swears by safety first. Even he prioritises the return of capital over the return on capital.</p>
      <p>Does this not fly in the face of conventional wisdom? Is it not counter-intuitive to how most investors think?</p>
      <p>Yes, it is.</p>
      <p>Most investors believe that higher returns are not possible without higher risks. Their mantra is to <a href="https://www.equitymaster.com/profit-hunter/detail.asp?date=09/19/2019&amp;story=3&amp;title=Auto-Stocks-Wealth-Destroyers-or-Once-in-a-Decade-Opportunity">maximise the upside</a> and not worry about the downside too much.</p>
      <p>We don't have to go too far back to find out how dangerous this approach is. Investors lost a bundle in mid and small caps in 2018 and 2019 precisely due to this approach.</p>
      <p>They piled into these stocks without worrying about the downside at all.  All that mattered to them was the promise of a huge upside.</p>
      <p>But as Graham and Buffett said long ago, this is not how it works in investing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Trying to maximise upside without protecting the downside is a recipe for disaster.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the lesson had to be learnt the hard way. Most investors who prioritised returns over safety of capital, lost their shirts in the crash.</p>
      <p>In fact, go back to any crisis in the stock market and the exact same pattern plays itself out repeatedly.</p>
      <p>Those investors who don't build any downside protection suffer the most. They are the ones who end up with poor long-term returns.</p>
      <p>Now, don't get me wrong. I am not saying we should not be aggressive. We should certainly be.</p>
      <p>But the thought of protecting the downside should always be at the back of our minds.</p>
      <p>My mission with my <i>Double Income </i>project is to strike the right balance: <b>The right balance between maximising returns and minimising downside.</b></p>
      <p>I will be wary about risking too much in the quest for <a href="https://www.equitymaster.com/profit-hunter/detail.asp?date=10/11/2018&amp;story=3&amp;title=Stop-Read-This-Before-You-Cancel-Your-SIPs">extra profits</a>. I will also be mindful of being too conservative in the name of safety of capital.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, I have developed what I call – <b>Income Supervisor Map</b><i>.</i></p>
      <p>I believe, this map is just the right tool for this journey to double one's income. It is a blend of the key philosophies of three of the biggest legends in the investing world: Ben Graham, Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle.</p>
      <p>My <i>Income Supervisor Map </i>borrows from the key investment principles of these titans of investing. The result is a great blueprint which could double your income in the quickest possible time.</p>
      <p>So, what exactly is my <i>Income Supervisor Map </i>all about and how does it borrow from three legends?</p>
      <p>In my upcoming editorials, I will share details about all three parts of this map.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more...</p>
