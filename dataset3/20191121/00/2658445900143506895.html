      <p>I am sure many of us have seen the video of the Queen’s College pupil who had the effrontery to wear fake eyelashes and paint her nails to school.  The video has been shared on the social media – with people calling the girl and her mother unprintable names.</p>
      <p>Well, I think differently.  The matter could have been better handled.  First, let me talk about the video.  It saddens me that someone, or people, who are likely teachers or non-academic members of staff or even parents of pupils of the school – core stakeholders; the internal publics – could deem it okay to shoot a video of such disgrace on their phones and post it on the social media.  If the video was done to help with investigation afterwards, then it would have been good.  But that would not have been noble enough for the mobile videographers.  They had to, in the spirit of generosity that rules the social media share it to all their contacts on all their platforms for – clout?</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, there is no video that shows us the first scene in the drama.  We only joined the movie when the slay teenager’s momager (as my class mates called her) was fighting a security man attached to the school for allegedly sending her daughter out for the offense.   All that needed to have been done was for the young lady to be disciplined according to the school’s rules and regulations.  In this case where the Momager resorted to assault, deal with it according to the law.  The school could have decided to call the police.  But for videographers to focus on publicising the matter – not minding that a minor was involved – was so inappropriate.</p>
      <p>In investigating this matter, I hope the Queen’s College authorities would seek to find out who among the school’s workers shared the videos on the social media.  A source at the scene noted that the incident generated such interest that even outsiders gathered to watch – invariably compromising security.  It may have been an outsider.  But if the school has CCTV coverage, it is time to look into it to determine what happened.  (If it does not, it is time to get security camera).</p>
      <p>The school also needs to establish a crisis management policy to avoid issues like this.  This should serve as a platform for re-training of workers on how to manage such problems should they arise.  If workers know how to better manage the crisis, the school would be better protected.</p>
