      <p><b>HARRISBURG, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled Senate has passed compromise legislation to raise Pennsylvania's minimum wage for the first time since 2009 in a deal with Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf. However, Wolf gave up a number of concessions to win its passage, and its prospects in Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled House of Representatives aren't clear. Here is a look at the bill:</p>
      <p>___</p>
      <p>THE WAGE</p>
      <p>Pennsylvania's minimum wage, currently set at the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour since 2009, would rise in four steps to $9.50 over the next two years. On July 1, 2020, the wage would rise to $8 an hour; to $8.50 on Jan. 1, 2021; to $9 on July 1, 2021; and to $9.50 on Jan. 1, 2022.</p>
      <p>About 385,000 people in Pennsylvania hold a job that pays between $7.25 an hour and $9.50 an hour, according to the state Department of Labor and Industry.</p>
      <p>OVERTIME PAY</p>
      <p>Under the deal with Republican lawmakers, Wolf will rescind a pending regulatory package to expand overtime pay eligibility that he began seeking last year after fruitlessly asking the Legislature to increase the minimum wage. That regulatory package was scheduled for a vote in front of a state rule-making board on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The regulation would require in 2022 that salaried workers earning up to $45,500 a year get time-and-a-half pay for any time they work over 40 hours in a week. Pennsylvania's current threshold is set at the federal baseline of $23,660, which took effect in 2004. The federal threshold is rising on Jan. 1 to almost $36,000. Some 140,000 people would become eligible for overtime pay at a baseline of $45,500, according to the Wolf administration.</p>
      <p>WOLF'S CONCESSIONS</p>
      <p>In January, Wolf rolled out an ambitious proposal to raise the minimum wage. That proposal would have raised the wage to $12 an hour immediately, then in annual 50-cent increases to $15 an hour in 2025.</p>
      <p>The compromise package makes other concessions. Those include: not raising Pennsylvania's tipped wage minimum from its current level of $2.83 an hour; and not adding an annual inflationary adjustment to the minimum wage.</p>
      <p>OTHER STATES</p>
      <p>Pennsylvania is one of 21 states that have a minimum wage at the federal minimum of $7.25. The 29 states that have raised their minimum wage include all of Pennsylvania's neighbors, while roughly half of the 50 states have scheduled automatic increases to their wages.</p>
      <p>The highest state minimum wage in 2020 will be Washington's at $13.50, while the average minimum wage in Pennsylvania's six neighbors will be above $10 an hour next year.</p>
