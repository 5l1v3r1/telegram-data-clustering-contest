      <p>Kinshasa. DR Congo's 2018 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Denis Mukwege on Wednesday urged France and the EU to provide military support to help stop civilian massacres in his country's troubled east.</p>
      <p>At least 60 civilians have been killed in North Kivu province since October 30, most in attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), despite the presence of UN peacekeepers and a Congolese army offensive.</p>
      <p>Another 10 or more were killed Wednesday in two more attacks blamed on the ADF in Beni and nearby Oicha, according to UN radio, citing military sources and local officials.</p>
      <p>"We are urging the European Union and France in particular to consider sending elite troops... under Chapter 7 of the UN Security Council to protect the civilian population of Beni against terrorism," Mukwege said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Mukwege was joint winner of the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize for his work helping victims of sexual violence committed in the conflict-ridden eastern DR Congo.</p>
      <p>He called for a similar mission to the 2003 Operation Artemis, which saw EU troops deployed under French command to intervene in ethnic massacres in the neighbouring DR Congo province of Ituri.</p>
