      <p><b>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WVLT/WBTV) --</b> A new study claims millennials are turning to astrology to help them process life, WBTV <a href="https://www.wbtv.com/2019/11/19/millennials-turning-astrology-combat-stress/">reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The study, published by the American Psychological Association, said millennials are among the most stressed Americans, and apps like Astrology Zone, AstroStyle and Co-Star are surging in popularity.</p>
      <p>"Millennials self-report more stress and less certainty about their future than any generation before them," Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Jessica Pels said. "They're also less religious than any generation before them. So they are looking for guidance."</p>
      <p>Astrology is more complex than just knowing whether you're a Gemini, Virgo or maybe a Capricorn.</p>
      <p>“So sun sign horoscopes, the things you read in papers or online now, are not-- they’re, like, one crumb of astrology’s cake,” author and astrologer Chani Nicholas said.</p>
      <p>Millennials also look into astrological birthcharts, which explain the position of all the planets at the moment of someone's birth.</p>
