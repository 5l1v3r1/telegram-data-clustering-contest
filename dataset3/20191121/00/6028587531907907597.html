      <p>Nemanja Matic could be on the verge of leaving Manchester United when the transfer window opens at the beginning of January. The Serbian international has grown frustrated at becoming a peripheral member of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad and would be open to securing a move away from Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>It had been thought he would head for Italy with Inter Milan showing the most interest in reuniting him with his former United team-mates Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez, who both moved to the San Siro last summer.</p>
      <p>But the appointment of Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur this week might possibly have opened up another option for Matic.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has previously signed the Serbian twice before; bringing him to Chelsea from Benfica in 2014, and then paying £40 million to lure him from Stamford Bridge to United in the summer of 2017.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, in response to an Instagram post that speculated Matic was patiently waiting for January so Mourinho could sign him again, the player replied with an approving clapping hands emoji.</p>

      <p>It is yet to be seen if Mourinho would sign Matic for a third time, but the thought of bringing in his experience to bolster the Tottenham squad might appeal.</p>
      <p>Even so the spectacle of a current United player publicly showing their interest in being signed by another Premier League club is highly unusual.</p>
      <p>But Matic must have reasoned he could not do any further damage to his relationship with a club he expects to be leaving in the near future.</p>
      <p>The Serbian has only started two Premier League games this season, and not played since United’s Europa League tie against Dutch side AZ Alkmaar at the beginning of October.</p>
      <p>The United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has largely preferred to start Scott McTominay and Fred in central midfield so far this season, and the return of Paul Pogba from injury in December will further limit Matic’s chances.</p>
      <p>The Serbian made a positive impact at Old Trafford when he arrived at the start of the 2017-18 season with his calm authority and smart passing from the centre of midfield.</p>

      <p>Matic remained as a starter throughout most of last season under both Mourinho and his successor Solskjaer, appearing in a total of 39 games.</p>
      <p>But this season the Norwegian manager decided the 31-year-old midfielder had become too ponderous for the style of football he aspired to, and he has spent most of his time either on the bench or in the stands.</p>
      <p>Matic simply doesn’t fit the mould of the quick and intense player Solskjaer wants to populate his squad with this season.</p>
      <p>Matic might have been sold as early as last summer, but after the departures of Marouane Fellaini and Ander Herrera, Solskjaer decided he could not afford to lose another experienced player.</p>
      <p>During the summer Matic had doubted United had enough experience to properly compete in the Premier League this season.   </p>
      <p>“Quality and experience brings you the title," he said. "In this squad we have quality and no experience. We have five or six top players, but they are still young, like Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. They have shown their quality on the pitch but they are too young to lead the team of course.”</p>
      <p>But Solskjaer has shown no interest in Matic leading this team, and if United can find a replacement they would possibly be open to selling him in January.</p>
      <p>Matic’s contract expires next summer, though the club retain the option of extending it by another year to 2021. </p>
