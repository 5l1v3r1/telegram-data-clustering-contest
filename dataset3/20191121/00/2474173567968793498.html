      <p>After a breakup, you might find yourself crying on the subway and checking your ex’s social media five times a day. <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/what-to-do-after-breakup">Breakups absolutely affect us</a> emotionally. So when you spend a few nights tossing and turning, you <i>can</i> blame your ex (or, more specifically, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/broken-heart-how-to-get-over-a-breakup">the breakup itself</a>) for your your <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/why-cant-i-sleep-through-the-night">inability to fall sleep</a>. But sometimes, post-breakup insomnia can be a little more complicated than just <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/anxiety-help-falling-asleep-at-night">post-split stress</a>.</p>
      <p>Yes — various <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2128619/">studies have found that stress is connected to insomnia</a>, and breakups can be <i>very</i> stressful. A <a href="https://file.scirp.org/pdf/PSYCH20110400016_74393857.pdf">2011 review of studies</a> found similarities between <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2018/01/187619/the-stages-of-break-up-grief">mourning a relationship</a> and grieving the death of a loved one: Both can lead to insomnia, intrusive thoughts, immune dysfunction, and even physical pain.</p>
      <p>Although you might wish you could cure your insomnia with some <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tea-health-benefits">chamomile tea</a>, unfortunately, the best medicine here is time. “There’s nothing to do other than wait it out, though I wish I could tell you to do something like drink a gallon of water,” sex &amp; relationships therapist and <a href="https://usstore.tenga-global.com/">TENGA</a> brand ambassador Shan Boodram tells Refinery29. “The best thing you can do is try to feed your <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/why-does-sex-feel-good-sexual-pleasure">dopamine [the 'feel-good chemical']</a> receptors in other ways: Go out, meet new people, and try to distract yourself as much as possible. But ultimately, the withdrawal process sucks for everyone.”</p>
      <p>Post-breakup insomnia is usually a type of <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/acute-insomnia-causes-treatment">acute insomnia</a> — a brief period of sleeplessness that happens because of life circumstances. According to the <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/insomnia/what-insomnia">National Sleep Foundation</a>, this type of insomnia usually resolves itself on its own within a few days or weeks. During this period, you can make some simple lifestyle changes to <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/how-to-fall-asleep">fall asleep easier</a> — try to go to bed at the same time every day, cut down on your caffeine intake, and develop a routine to relax before bed, such as taking a bath or reading a book. You can also try <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/anxiety-help-falling-asleep-at-night">practice calming your thoughts</a>, for example by doing guided meditation or breathing exercises.</p>
      <p>But although most of us are <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/am-i-depressed-after-breakup">sad after a breakup</a>, for some, breakups can trigger depressive episodes. And changes in your sleeping habits are one sign that your post-breakup blues may have tipped from "just sadness" into something more serious. (Other signs are changes in appetite, hygiene, and concentration, as well as feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, or hopelessness.) </p>
      <p>After a breakup, "the first 30 days or so is just part of the natural grieving process," <a href="http://drchloe.com/breakups/">Chloe Carmichael</a>, PhD, a psychologist in New York City, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/am-i-depressed-after-breakup">previously told Refinery29</a>.<b> </b>But if you’re still experiencing these symptoms after that, she added, it’s a time to seek professional support. And hey, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/first-therapy-session-starting-counseling-expectations">going to therapy</a> after a breakup is almost always a good idea, anyway.</p>
