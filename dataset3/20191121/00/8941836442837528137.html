      <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Former <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Minnesota Vikings</a> kicker <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Fred Cox</a>, one of the last of the straight-on placekickers and a standout on several conference championship teams, has died. He was 80.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> announced <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a>’s death Thursday without disclosing details. The team did not immediately return messages seeking more information.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a>, who also co-created the Nerf football, scored a Minnesota-record 1,365 points in his 15 seasons, often kicking in nasty conditions because the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> played outdoors during his career from 1963-77. When he retired, he was second in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> history in scoring behind George Blanda - who also played quarterback - and had made 282 field goals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> was one of 11 <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> to play in all four of the team’s Super Bowls, all defeats. He kicked in 18 postseason games.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> called <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> “one of our proudest legends, a respected teammate and friend. Fred’s football career as the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a>’ all-time leading scorer set the stage for a life where he went on to achieve great things in business and in his community. Fred’s positive energy, strength in his faith and passion for life will be missed.”</p>

      <p>During his playing days he also got a chiropractor’s license.</p>
      <p>An All-Pro in 1969, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> twice led the league in scoring while using a square-toed shoe to do his kicking. On a team with several Hall of Famers, including Fran Tarkenton, Carl Eller, Alan Page and Paul Krause, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> also was a standout.</p>
      <p>But he never earned a Super Bowl victory, and once said:</p>
      <p>“The fans have never been able to live with the fact that we lost four times,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> said. “But the bottom line is that for any team to get there four times is an amazing feat.”</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> played fullback as well as kicked at Pitt. Drafted by the Browns in the eighth round in 1961, he sat out a year because of a back injury. But he learned about <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-football-league/">NFL</a> kicking from another Hall of Famer, Cleveland’s Lou “The Toe” Groza, also a straight-on kicker.</p>
        <p>Minnesota acquired <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> in 1962, but cut him. He made the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> the next year and stuck for 15 seasons.</p>
        <p>Bud Grant, who coached those <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/minnesota-vikings/">Vikings</a> squads, told the team’s website that “<a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Fred</a> was the ultimate team player for us. He took part in all of our scout teams, playing running back or whatever we asked of him. He was a great asset to our team, a true credit to the team and his community. If you saw those games, he always stood right next to me on the sideline because he was such a big part of what we were doing with field position and knew the game so well.”</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/fred-cox/">Cox</a> is survived by his wife, Bonnie, and four children.</p>
