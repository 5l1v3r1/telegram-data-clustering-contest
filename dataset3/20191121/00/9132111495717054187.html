      <p>The governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) has accused the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) of successfully confusing Ghanaians who were until now very well settled on voting YES in the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>The National Referendum proposes the amendment of the 1992 constitution (Article 55(3) to allow political parties to sponsor candidates to local level elections, a situation outlawed by the constitution currently.</p>
      <p>There have been unending debates over the prudence and ramifications of allowing political parties to put forward candidates for election of Assembly and unit committee members.</p>
      <p>The build-up to the referendum has sparked a sharp disagreement among the two main political parties on the amendment of article 55(3) of the 1992 constitution.</p>
      <p>The opposition National Democratic Congress last week addressed a press conference calling for a rejection of the proposal to make local level elections partisan.</p>
      <p>Citing corruption, divisiveness and cost burden as reasons for campaigning for a NO vote, the governing New Patriotic Party however the position of the NDC is a manifestation of action in bad fate.</p>
      <p>General Secretary of the NPP John Boadu who addressed the press a week ago, said the NDC’s sudden U-turn on is shocking and opportunistic, describing it as “Unpatriotic betrayal of the Ghanaian people” and “a naked show of dishonesty, deceit, indecision, lack of candour and integrity from the biggest opposition party in the country”.</p>
      <p>“If the NDC’s position is meant to confuse Ghanaians, then it has succeeded”, he said.</p>
      <p>According to him, the NDC throughout various engagements on the matter had agreed to a YES vote and therefore the recent position of the opposition party has succeeded in confusing Ghanaians on the subject matter.</p>
      <p>The NPP emphasized that a “Yes” vote was neither about the NPP nor NDC but what was good for Ghana.</p>
