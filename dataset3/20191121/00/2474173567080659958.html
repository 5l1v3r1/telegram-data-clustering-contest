      <p>Gemstones have influenced some of the buzziest recent beauty trends: <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/2019/06/234986/rihanna-lavender-jade-nail-art-instagram">Jade nails</a>, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/gemlights">rose quartz hair</a>, and <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/marble-nails-designs">marble-inspired</a> designs are just a few ways they've taken a front seat over the past year. Not only are the colourful stones pretty to look at, but their healing properties also carry weight in the beauty world — which is why, for the latest episode of <i>Beauty With Mi</i>, Mi-Anne visited licensed acupuncturist <a href="https://elizabethtrattner.com/">Elizabeth Trattner</a> to try her Instagram-famous Gemstone Facial.</p>
      <p>The service, which can cost up to £300, utilises acupuncture, facial cupping, Gua Sha massage, aromatherapy, and the strategic placement of colourful healing crystals and stones to de-puff and destress high-strung skin. Whatever tension you carry when you walk in for a facial, Trattner's goal is to have you feeling zen and glowy long after you step out. Press play to watch Mi-Anne get the full gemstone treatment, above.</p>
