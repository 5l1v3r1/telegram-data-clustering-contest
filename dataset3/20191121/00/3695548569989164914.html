        <b>The 2019 Aston Martin Racing Driver Academy has been won by newly crowned British GT4 champion Tom Canning.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Canning came out top of the field of 23 drivers aged between 17 and 25 racing Aston GT3 or GT4 machinery during 2020 who were part of the initiative.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old was chosen by a panel of judges including Aston factory drivers Darren Turner and Jonny Adam, as well as Paul Howarth, team principal of the AMR World Endurance Championship squad.</p>
      <p>Canning, who claimed the class title in the British GT Championship driving a TF Sport Aston Martin Vantage GT4, will receive a financial contribution towards his 2020 race programme, as well career guidance and simulator time.</p>

      <p>He follows in the footsteps of Ross Gunn, who won the scheme when it was known as the Aston Martin Evolution Academy in 2015 and is now racing AMR's factory-run GTE Am entry in the '19/20 WEC.</p>
      <p>AMR president David King said: "Tom is clearly a very promising talent, and this shone through in all aspects of his academy training.</p>
      <p>"He approached the programme with maturity and focus, and his attitude was exemplary.</p>
      <p>"That he combined all this with a consummate campaign in the British GT Championship shows that he fully deserves the opportunity to become part of the AMR family."</p>
      <p>Canning added: "I am excited to become part of the AMR family, and look forward to my new role, working closer with the team in 2020 and getting back in the Aston Martin Vantage."</p>
      <p>Other drivers who were part of the scheme included Ash Hand, Canning's co-champion in 2019, and their team-mates at TF, Josh Price and Patrick Kibble. Applications for the 2020 academy open in December.</p>
