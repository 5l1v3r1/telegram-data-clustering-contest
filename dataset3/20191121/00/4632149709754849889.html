      <p><i>By Santanu Chakraborty<br/><br/>If all conditions had a direct and defined cause manifested as a change in one spot of the genome then we might have an easier time healing it. But that is not quite how nature works</i> <br/><br/>A s our society has transitioned from one close to nature to one that strives to conquer it, we have developed products to achieve human dominance over a range of species – from bacteria to whales. This has had consequences, one of which is the increase in a large number of chronic diseases. Conditions like obesity and linked liver diseases are extremely common around the word today, especially in urbanised environments. But what in the environment drives certain traits in human beings that live there? What has been somewhat neglected in modern times is that multiple factors and their interactions lie at the root of not just multiple distinct conditions but also many diseases that are considered to be a single condition. It is important to note that there are diseases that are essentially single factor diseases, at least that is how they began before secondary issues also developed. Examples include many genetic conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, that are known to be caused by a change in just one location of our genome. The discovery of these single gene diseases at a time when the field of genetics itself was being born was cause for considerable exuberance. If all conditions had a direct and defined cause manifested as a change in one spot of the genome then we might have an easier time healing it. We could definitely diagnose such conditions much more effectively as we would know exactly what to look for. But that is not quite how nature works, at least not a lot of the time. <br/><br/>Let us take chronic obesity as an example and try to think about what might be causing it. I have friends who are obsessive calorie counters and obsessive exercisers, but these are only a few. There are also those who are at the other extreme combining a love of food with a love of laziness justified by a variety of ideologies. But most of us are somewhere in the middle, where one wants to get moderately fit but just does not get around to putting in the effort. We gain weight with prolonged overeating, partying and what have you but also lose weight when we cut down. Yet what deserves our attention are the cases that are massive deviations from the average. We occasionally meet people who seem to eat pretty much everything and in no small quantity, but are lean as a stick. There are also those who claim, yours truly included, that they eat nothing but gain weight. These situations are often dismissed as imaginary issues by most people. There is, however, a very sound basis to these claims as is being discovered by scientists, now armed with modern tools that can actually look into this matter on a microscopic scale. <br/><br/>The food we eat must be processed into a slush which then moves through our alimentary canal where nutrients are absorbed from this dough after which it is finally excreted. That something is excreted all suggests that not all of our food intake can actually be broken down into molecules that can be absorbed into our system for maintenance and repair. Yet food has been scarce for the vast majority of our evolutionary history. Is excretion then not an immense waste? What ameliorates this problem somewhat is that over millions of years of evolution many animals have acquired a set of bacteria living in their gut that can break down the foods that we can’t. In theory this is good for both – the bacterial colony as well as the animal – as each gets access to more food than in isolation. Over millions of years of evolution we arrived at an arrangement which produced a very large diversity of bacteria in our guts. In fact the total number of bacteria in healthy adult guts exceeds the total number of human cells in our bodies. <br/><br/>Then came the industrial revolution flooding our world with chemicals and antibiotics. The result, it is now clear, is a vast alteration of the microbiome. Scientists have now demonstrated that germ free mice put on less weight despite eating more. Interestingly, colonising the guts of germ free mice with the microbes of normal mice induces quick weight gain. This an other experiments have led scientist to study the microbiome in great detail revealing links to gene regulation for fat absorption and even neural signalling. Could it be that conditions like alcoholic fatty liver disease, thought to be triggered entirely by alcohol, may have certain bacterial imbalances as one of its triggers? In a recent paper published in the journal Nature, Duan et al. (13 Nov 2019) demonstrate that a toxin secreted by a bacterium called Enterococcus faecalis injures liver cells and results in their death leading to acute hepatitis. Their solution uses a phage, naturally occurring viruses that infect and kill bacterial cells, choosing a strain that is specific for E. Faecialis instead of wholesale microbiome killing antibiotics. The result is the abolition of induced hepatitis from the livers of mice that were implanted with bacteria from the guts of alcoholic liver disease patients.</p>
