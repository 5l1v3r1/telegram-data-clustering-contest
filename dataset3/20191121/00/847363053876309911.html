      <p>News from WCC<br/>Wellington Mayor Andy Foster has welcomed figures showing tourism has helped fuel the capital’s economy and boosted the city’s GDP above the national average.</p>
      <p>The Infometrics Quarterly Economic Monitor was released today, with the Wellington City Retail Sales Report, both for the year to the end of September.</p>
      <p>“It’s heartening to see the latest figures,” Mayor Foster says. “Tourist numbers are increasing and they are spending nearly $2 billion a year in the city.</p>
      <p>“Our GDP growth is above the national average, and the unemployment rate has dropped from 4.3 percent to 3.5 percent.</p>
      <p>“Wellington City Council is also approving an increasing value of building work – the rate of growth in that area is exceeding the national average.”</p>
      <p>Councillor Diane Calvert, who holds the Economic Development Portfolio, says the figures show good news for hospitality businesses and retailers.</p>
      <p>Wellington city merchants recorded electronic card retail spend of $3.22 billion in the year to September 2019, up by 3.7 percent.</p>
      <p>This was driven largely by more people eating out and an increase in spending in the automotive category, like fuel, repairs and maintenance.</p>
      <p>“Hospitality recorded the largest increase, of $49.8m, and seven out of the eight merchant categories had higher levels of sales,” Cr Calvert says.</p>
      <p>The figures also show a 28 percent increase in the value of the cruise ship trade. Cruise ships will make more than 120 visits to Wellington this season.</p>
      <p>Quarterly Economic Monitor figures:</p>
      <p>• Tourism spending was up 8.1 percent to $1,961 million in the year to Sept 2019; this compares to 6.8 percent in the region and 3.1 percent nationally.</p>
      <p>• Guest nights increased by 3.3 percent in the year to Sept 2019; this compares to 3.2 percent in the region and 1.2 percent nationally.</p>
      <p>• GDP growth was 2.7 percent for the year to Sept 2019 compared to a year earlier. This compares to GDP growth of 2.4 percent in the region and 2.4 percent nationally.</p>
      <p>• The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, down from 4.3 percent a year earlier; this continues its downward trend since it peaked in 2010.</p>
      <p>• The number of residential consents increased by 13.2 percent over the year to Sept 2019; this compares to 11.3 percent in the region and 12.7 percent nationally.</p>
      <p>• The value of non-residential consents issued during the year to Sept 2019 totalled $354m.</p>
      <p>Wellington City Retail Sales Summary:</p>
      <p>• Spend at Wellington city merchants was up 3.7 percent in the year to Sept 2019.</p>
      <p>• Spend by Wellington residents was up 3.0 percent in the year to Sept 2019.</p>
