      <p>It was a figment of someone’s imagination, but soon it became a reality, a reality that enabled billions worldwide to access information, relax and get educated.</p>
      <p>Several years down the line, Scottish-born John Logie Baird’s television set has changed the world, whichever way you want to look at it; for the good and for the bad.</p>
      <p>As today, November 21, 2019 marks World Television Day, Ghanaweb takes a look back in history, at the birth of television and how the set has evolved into various shapes and forms through generations.</p>
      <p>Now, people are privileged, they have the luxury of making choices, mostly depending on preference and what one can afford. Well, in the old days, the situation was pretty different.</p>
      <p>After Ghana’s independence in 1957, only a privileged few had the 'Almighty' black and white television in their homes. Anyone who had this was classified as wealthy because the person's home became the hub for community members to watch their favourite TV shows on the famous 'President TV' which was the outstanding black and white tv brand at the time.</p>
      <p>When the crowd becomes uncontrollably massive, owners of these sets will resort to tactics to reduce the crowd; tactics including the rule: “No bathing, no entry”.</p>
      <p>Let’s take a look at how we got to the stage of flat screens and the like in today’s world.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Black and white with a removable screen</b>
      </p>
      <p>As time went on, there was an introduction of a hybrid of the black and white tv. This evolution had a new feature; a removable rainbow-like screen that one could cling onto the tv.</p>
      <p>This removable screen adds a touch to the images being aired hence, a partial coloured view was established with this device. It was however limited to the middle class and only those with the President TV.</p>

      <p>Moving away from the analogue television transmission to a digital terrestrial television platform; LCDs, LEDs, 5Ds, smart TVs and the latest invention by Safo Kantanka were introduced into the system.</p>
      <p>
        <b>LCD and LEDs TVs</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both LCD and LED TVs are still in use but most people are upgrading it with the light of speed since new and improved television sets flood the market. At the peak of the LCD, LED era, they were fun to watch. However, LED TVs run with greater energy efficiency and can provide a clearer, better picture than the general LCD TVs. Mostly, the TV works with a color wheel or distinct RGB-colored lights (red, green, blue) to produce more realistic and sharper colors for viewers.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Plasma TV</b>
      </p>
      <p>In 2007, the purchase of plasma tv was on the increase due to the technological trends at the time. Coming in different inches, a consumer may wish to have 33 inches in his room to attract 'fans' from friends and family. But sometimes, the story gets emotional, especially when you want a particular one but the amount of money in your pocket determines which one you have to go for. This plasma flat screen tv, however, was an upgrade of the LCD and LED tvs.</p>

        <b>Smart TV</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having this type of tv gives the owner more room to access a number of channels on the TV. From TV programmes to movies and music without the need to connect a TV antenna. You can also watch it without necessarily subscribing to a cable satellite service. Other features include web browsing, gaming, and having access to a compatible media content stored on your computer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Curved TVs</b>
      </p>
      <p>With curved TVs, you feel more immersed in what you are watching. The images are made to look really close to you as its rounded nature gives you a peripheral vision because of the tv's million pixels with an upgrade in its upscaling quality. The images or videos displayed captures the full attention of the individual or group of persons and this is noted to be more fun. Customers can also display their images on the screen as paintings on the TV even when it is off.</p>

        <b>Kantanka TV</b>
      </p>
      <p>Televisions are usually switched off by pressing either the power button on the tv set or using a remote to turn it on. With this latest TV invention from Kantanka, all you need to do to switch on a television device is to clap twice. When you want to change the TV channel, you just need a single clap and it automatically does the changes.</p>
      <p>If you want to increase or decrease the volume on your TV, all you need to do is to continuously clap, depending on the pitch of the sound, your tv set will either increase or decrease.</p>
      <p>If you lived through the various phases of the television set, this piece is probably giving you a feeling of nostalgia. But If you are a 90’s born, with all the technological advancement at your disposal now then you should be grateful for life wasn’t this simple back in the day.</p>
