      <p>Another Thanksgiving is coming. Let us be thankful for the great success of the year that passed. How about the challenges and hardships? I am proud that I had gone through burnout! You should too! “Be thankful for what you have; you’ll end up having more”. Yes, we heard <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey.</a></p>
      <p>Below are 3 reasons to remind ourselves why burnout is a blessing.</p>
      <h3>Burnout encourages a more inspiring career</h3>
      <p>Have you ever imagined that without burnout, you might never have the courage to leave an uninspiring career? Sometimes we need a push to get out of our comfort zone and the routine that is created.</p>
      <p>I have been an “ordinary” mother for years without knowing that I <a href="https://mind-flower.org/2019/11/13/i-was-wrong-to-bring-to-my-children-only-care-and-love/">was wrong to bring to my children only care and love</a>, and not my dreams and inspiration.</p>
      <p>One friend asked me: Is it ok to be be fired and still happy? Yes, sometimes it’s exciting to leave a certain job! Do you feel something exciting and brand new coming? Then it will show up very soon if you truly believe in it!</p>
      <h3>Burnout pushes you to a positive lifestyle change</h3>
      <p>Whether it is the right time to recharge your energy, to find out some help, or to search for better work-life balance, burnout did bring its voice! It is an excellent opportunity to have a positive change in your lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Be grateful that you can create new habits, for example being more mindful in <a href="https://mind-flower.org/2019/10/29/6-easy-things-you-can-do-daily-to-cultivate-joys/">cultivating joy, </a>or <a href="https://mind-flower.org/2019/11/05/energy-for-what-matters/">preserving your energy</a>. Do these today!</p>
      <h3>Burnout can unlock your potentials</h3>
      <p>Most people never doubt that they are more powerful than they think. When you are burned out, you are pushed to that limit of self-belief and self-identity.</p>
      <p>It’s an occasion to realize the fact that we might have been living for years in an “ordinary” way that isn’t quite aligned with our highest purpose.</p>
      <p>Believe me, burnout is your inner-being calling you to unlock the fullness of your life and <a href="https://mind-flower.org/2019/10/30/the-first-human-to-be-on-mars-by-2030-talks-about-realising-ones-dream/">realize your wildest dreams</a>!</p>
      <p>These are 3 main points that I always keep in my “adventure luggage”. Who knows, you are also on the way to a new exciting career, a greater lifestyle, and more cohesion with your ultimate state of flow! Chill up and enjoy the unfolding!</p>
