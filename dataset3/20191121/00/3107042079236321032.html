      <h1>Arborists bring Daisy back down to earth in 'challenging' rescue</h1>

      <p>A team of professional arborists were called to take part in a spectacular rescue last week.</p>
      <p>Treetech Specialist Treecare Ltd was called out to rescue the tonkinese cat Daisy last week after she got stuck up a 15m tree on Huntsbury Hill.</p>
      <p>The drama unfolded after a dog startled the cat, causing it to run up the nearest tree.</p>
      <p>SPCA Christchurch was then alerted and reached out to Tree-tech to help rescue Daisy.</p>
      <p>The SPCA first called the Fire Service but it did not have the gear to attempt the rescue.</p>
      <p>“Because the tree was down a steep track, there was no way any vehicles could get near it, which made it more challenging,” an SPCA spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>The cat was stuck up the tree for 24 hours before being rescued.</p>
      <p>To complete the job, Treetech aborist Nathan Shaw had to climb the tree and descend onto the limb where the cat was from above.</p>
      <p>He then approached the cat cautiously and gently lifted it into his empty rope bag.</p>
      <p>The rope bag was secured at the top and then gently lowered using climbing equipment.</p>
      <p>Once on the ground, the SPCA crew transferred Daisy to a cage. Treetech managing director Chris Walsh said it has carried out similar cat rescues in the past.</p>
      <p>“We have even rescued an entangled magpie out of a tree when asked to by the Fire Service. When we are approached by the likes of the SPCA or Fire Service to provide specialist tree services, we are happy to contribute our time and expertise,” Mr Walsh said.</p>
      <p>The SPCA returned the microchipped Daisy to her owner.</p>
