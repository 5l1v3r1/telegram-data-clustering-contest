      <p>The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, has accused Julius Berger and Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC) of fighting against the actualization of the sovereign state of Biafra.</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the IPOB leader made this allegation during a live broadcast on Radio Biafra recently.</p>
      <p>Kanu said Julius Berger and Shell don’t want the disintegration of Nigeria because of their investment in the country.</p>
      <p>The secessionist leader maintained that the companies would rather work with the “ Fulanis who they can continue to cheat” instead of working with IPOB.</p>
      <p>“Do you know that Julius Berger and Shell are lobbying against IPOB? Kanu asked during the live broadcast on Radio Biafra.</p>
      <p>The IPOB leader continued that: They don’t want the disintegration of the zoo because of their investment in the zoo and they don’t want any deal with IPOB either, rather they prefer deals with Fulanis who they can continue to cheat.</p>
      <p>“Think about it. Just imagine if one of these companies are lobbying in favor of IPOB. Don’t you know that the zoo would have been history by now?</p>
      <p>“Do you know that a year turn over of shell is 20 times more than zoo budget? Just a tip of an iceberg of what IPOB is fighting against.</p>
      <p>“They don’t want the disintegration of the zoo because of their investment in the zoo.</p>
      <p>“And they don’t want any deal with IPOB either, rather they prefer deals with Fulanis who they can continue to cheat.</p>
      <p>“Think about it. Just imagine if one of these companies is lobbying in favor of IPOB. Don’t you know that the zoo would have been history by now?</p>
      <p>“When you keep asking what are we doing ? what are we doing ? You think Biafra will just come when you pick up arms unprepared? This is why we failed before and I Nnamdi Kanu and IPOB shall not repeat the same mistake. If we go to war now without meeting the necessary people, and important government of the world, the zoo will just tag us rebels, terrorists and with their influence and wealth, the international communities shall buy into that deceit to join and carry out a second genocide against our people as they did in 1967- 70.</p>
      <p>“Do you know that the zoo has already bought off all the major mainstream media of the world not to discuss Biafra in their platforms.</p>
      <p>“Do you see why I always reverence his Excellency Late General Chukwu Emeka Odumegwu Ojukwu for withstanding the world in a defensive battle for 30 months? He is greatest indeed but IPOB is here to complete that mission and we shall surely come out victorious because Chukwuokike has mandated us for this very divine mission.”</p>
