      <p>JERUSALEM (AP) - A former policewoman in Israel has been charged with assault and reckless use of a weapon for allegedly shooting an unarmed Palestinian man in the back with a sponge-tipped bullet as he walked away from a West Bank checkpoint.</p>
      <p>The case has drawn widespread attention since Channel 13 TV broadcast a video of the May 2018 incident earlier this month.</p>
      <p>In the video, the Palestinian is shot in the back nearly 20 seconds after walking away from the checkpoint.</p>
      <p>Border police often use sponge-tipped bullets as a “nonlethal” tool to disperse crowds, but the bullets are painful and can cause serious injury.</p>

        <p>The Palestinian, Karam Qawasmi, said on Thursday that other officers also abused him and should have been charged. He says he fears she’ll receive a “very light punishment.”</p>
