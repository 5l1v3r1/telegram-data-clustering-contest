      <p>YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) - Health officials say a hepatitis A outbreak in Yakima County now involves 11 cases.</p>
      <p>The Yakima Health District said Thursday that the cases involve people experiencing homelessness or those who use illicit drugs.</p>
      <p>The health district announced the outbreak Nov. 7, when five cases were confirmed in Yakima County.</p>
      <p>Since then, various local agencies have done outreach and vaccinated 74 people.</p>
      <p>The virus affects the liver and spreads through contaminated feces. It causes symptoms like fever, dark urine, yellow-tinged skin or eyes, fatigue and gastric issues. People pass it along by eating or drinking tainted food or water, or through sex.</p>
