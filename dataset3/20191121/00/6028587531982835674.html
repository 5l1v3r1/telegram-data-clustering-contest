      <p>The 2020 Baseball Hall of Fame ballot came out earlier this week, and for the fourth year Manny Ramirez’s name was on it.The slugger who currently ranks 15<sup>th</sup> on the all-time home run list (555), and 19<sup>th</sup> on the all-time RBI list (1,831), is unlikely to garner the 75 percent of the vote necessary for induction into Cooperstown. His first three years on the ballot he’s received 23.8 percent of the vote, then 22 percent, then 22.8 percent last year.</p>
      <p>Ramirez, though, believes someday he’ll be honored at Cooperstown.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see. We’ll see what’s going to happen. I’m pretty sure maybe in 15 or 20 years, we’ll probably get in,” he said with a chuckle at the 18<sup>th</sup> Annual The Tradition Gala at TD Garden in Boston.</p>
      <p>Now 47 years old and eight years removed from his last MLB game, Ramirez doesn’t hide from the biggest reason he hasn’t already been inducted in the Hall of Fame. In 2009, he was suspended for 50 games for violating MLB’s drug policy. Two years later, another bust and a 100-game suspension convinced him to retire from baseball rather than serve out the ban.</p>
      <p>As one would expect from the free-spirited Ramirez, he says he has no regrets because of what he’s become later in life after his baseball experiences.</p>
      <p>“Not really [any regrets],” he said. “I ask myself if it was a good thing for me, because it made me grow up. Maybe a lot of people they didn’t get caught, and they doing maybe so many crazy stuff but they’re not learning from it. So I think everything happens for a reason and everything is working for the good. I’m in a better place than I ever been even when I was playing, so I don’t regret it because it made me grow up.”</p>
      <p>Ramirez is now lumped into a group with other players that have received PED bans, and others that have lived under a cloud of suspension since the 1990s, awaiting the BBWAA writers to vote them in. Asked about that group of players, Ramirez drew a line to another former on-field legend whose transgressions have kept him from baseball’s Hall (and reinstatement to the game).</p>
      <p>“It was the same thing like with Pete Rose. That’s it, let that guy get in. That’s it, everybody makes mistakes. I make mistakes every day. Everybody makes it, but we’ve got to keep moving, so what else can you do,” he said.</p>
      <p>Ramirez made more than $200 million in his career. He said he’s living comfortably now and has come to realize “money doesn’t buy happiness” while living with his wife and three children. He won two World Series championships in Boston and then left under controversial circumstances when he seemed to force the Red Sox to trade him to the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008. He described Boston as being “back home” and among all the memories he has of playing for the Red Sox, he picked a touching one to highlight.</p>
      <p>“Going inside the Green Monster,” the former left-fielder said about a place he could often be found during breaks in the action. “I remember there used to be like three kids working in there. They always got water and Gatorade, it was awesome.”</p>
