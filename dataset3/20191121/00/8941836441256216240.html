      <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) - Dana Evans scored 18 points to lead No. 8 Louisville to an 86-37 victory over Chattanooga on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Despite posting a season high in points, the Cardinals (4-0) were more impressive on defense. They held the Mocs to just 24.6% shooting, while forcing 18 turnovers and outrebounding their guests 59-28.</p>
      <p>That defensive effort allowed Louisville, which shot just 34.9% in the first half, to go on a 15-2 run over a 6-minute stretch in the second quarter and hold a 35-11 lead in the final minute of the first half.</p>
      <p>Louisville warmed up from the field after halftime, shooting 58.8%.</p>
      <p>Evans, a junior guard, made 8 of 12 shots. Kylee Shook posted her third consecutive double-double, going for 12 points and 11 rebounds. Freshman Norika Konno added a career-high 11 points. Elizabeth Balogun added 11 rebounds to go with nine points.</p>

      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Chattanooga: The Mocs entered Thursday averaging just 52.3 points per game, which ranked 323rd in Division I, and faced a squad that had allowed opponents to shoot just 31.3%. The Cardinals’ quickness and pressure defense caused three scoring droughts of 3:51 or longer in the first half, which allowed Louisville to overcome its own offensive difficulties and still put the game away before halftime.</p>
      <p>Louisville: Shooting woes continued for the Cardinals early on even though they faced a team that was allowing opponents to shoot 46%. Louisville shot 29.2% in the first quarter, thanks mainly to the Cardinals missing their first eight shots. Six of those came on layups or putbacks.</p>
