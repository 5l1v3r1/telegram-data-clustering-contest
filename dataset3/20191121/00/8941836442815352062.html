      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - Out of the running for the Race to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dubai/">Dubai</a> title, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rory-mcilroy/">Rory McIlroy</a> still forced his way onto center stage at the season-ending World <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-tour-championship/">Tour Championship</a> on Thursday by producing one of his greatest shots of the year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rory-mcilroy/">McIlroy</a> flushed a 3-wood from 291 yards with his second shot at the par-5 18th hole on the Earth Course, the ball settling five feet from the cup. He rolled in the eagle putt for an 8-under 64, leaving the second-ranked <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rory-mcilroy/">McIlroy</a> a stroke off the lead held by ailing Frenchman <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-lorenzo-vera/">Mike Lorenzo-Vera</a>.</p>
      <p>“As soon as I hit it, I knew it was perfect,” the four-time major champion said, adding it was “possibly the best shot I’ve hit all year.”</p>
      <p>It was <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rory-mcilroy/">McIlroy</a>’s best round at an event he won in 2012 and 2015. Even if he makes it three victories in eight years in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dubai/">Dubai</a>, it still won’t be enough for him to be crowned Europe’s No. 1 player.</p>
      <p>Five players are still in contention for that honor, and Jon Rahm made the best start of the quintet by shooting a bogey-free, 6-under 66 to move into third place, three strokes behind <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-lorenzo-vera/">Lorenzo-Vera</a>.</p>

      <p>Rahm last played competitively in early October at the Open de Espana - a tournament he won by five shots - and said he barely touched a club for five of the past six weeks he took off in the longest break of his career.</p>
      <p>“I could tell how rested I was mentally because on some holes I never lost patience, I never really got down on myself and stayed with that positive attitude,” said Rahm, who is known for his fiery temperament on the course. “I’m hoping I can keep playing solid and keep it for the next three days.</p>
      <p>“It was hard to get into that routine again but once I came to the tournament, you kind of switch, you get to the tournament, you get to grinding.”</p>
      <p>Rahm needs a win this week to stand a chance of taking the Race to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dubai/">Dubai</a> title for the first time. As does Tommy Fleetwood, who was happy with his start, too.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Fleetwood, winner of the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa last week, began his round by holing out from 153 yards for eagle on No. 1 and shot 67 for a tie for fourth place.</p>
        <p>“You can only put yourself out of it on day one,” said Fleetwood, who is second in the Race to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dubai/">Dubai</a> standings and is looking to capture the title for the second time in three years. “There’s a lot more to do. There’s 54 holes now. There are great players up there and all I can do is do my stuff. I’ve got three days of work left really until the end of the year. Just make the most of them.”</p>
        <p>Of the other Race to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dubai/">Dubai</a> contenders, Bernd Wiesberger shot 70 and was tied for 14th place, Matt Fitzpatrick shot 71, and Shane Lowry shot 73.</p>
        <p>Wiesberger leads the race and will lift the trophy if he wins in <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/dubai/">Dubai</a> or finishes alone in second place.</p>
        <p>“I’m just thinking 72-hole tournament this week. I’m not trying to look at what is happening,” said Wiesberger, who has won three tournaments this year in a strong return from seven months out with a wrist injury. “I can’t control what Tommy, Matt, Shane and Jon are doing.”</p>
        <p>Fleetwood knows a win, coupled with Wiesberger finishing lower than outright second, will be enough to be Europe’s No. 1 again. The same scenario faces third-place Rahm, who won the World <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/the-tour-championship/">Tour Championship</a> in 2017 and placed fourth last year.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mike-lorenzo-vera/">Lorenzo-Vera</a> finished with four straight birdies to tie his lowest round of the season, even though he said he was feeling “under the weather” because of a lung infection he caught in South Africa last week.</p>
        <p>“Honestly I’m not the feeling well at all,” said the Frenchman, who led by three shots before <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/rory-mcilroy/">McIlroy</a>’s late eagle. “I have no energy. I was down … Just one of those days where you try to put the ball in play.”</p>
