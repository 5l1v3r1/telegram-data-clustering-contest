      <h1>U.S. existing home sales rise more than expected in October</h1>

      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. home sales increased more than expected in October and house prices rose at the fastest pace in more than two years amid lower mortgage rates and a shortage of properties for sale.</p>
      <p>The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday that existing home sales rose 1.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.46 million units last month. September's sales pace was downwardly revised to 5.36 million units.</p>
      <p>Economists polled by Reuters had forecast existing home sales rising 1.4% to 5.47 million units.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has cut interest rates three times this year, which has bolstered the housing market by lowering mortgage rates.</p>
      <p>Last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he and his colleagues see a "sustained expansion" ahead as likely for the country's economy, with the full impact of recent interest rate cuts still to be felt and low unemployment boosting household spending.</p>
      <p>The central bank's reduction in borrowing costs has caused the 30-year fixed mortgage rate to drop more than 130 basis points since last November's peak to an average of 3.66%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.</p>
      <p>Other factors continue to weigh on housing though, including a chronic lack of properties for sale, which has inflated prices and kept many buyers on the sidelines.</p>
      <p>There were 1.77 million homes in the market last month, a decline of 4.3% compared to a year ago.</p>
      <p>In a more positive sign, data on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding rebounded in October and permits for future home construction jumped to a more than 12-year high.</p>
      <p>The median existing house price climbed 6.2% from a year ago to 270,900 in October, the strongest price appreciation since June 2017. It was the 92nd consecutive month of year-on-year price gains.</p>
      <p>"The lack of inventory is pushing up prices way too fast," said NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun.</p>
      <p>Existing home sales rose 4.6% from one year ago, the NAR said, the fourth consecutive month of year-on-year gains. Sales were mixed across the nation's four regions last month. They increased 4.4% in the South and 1.6% in the Midwest but retreated 1.4% in the Northeast. They fell 0.9% in the West.</p>
      <p>At October's sales pace, it would take 3.9 months to clear the current inventory, down from 4.3 months a year ago. A supply of six to seven months is seen as a healthy balance between supply and demand.</p>
