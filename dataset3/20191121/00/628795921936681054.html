        <i><a href="https://www.meerilinga.org.au/">Meerilinga Young Children’s Foundation</a> were recently presented with a <a href="https://www.lotterywest.wa.gov.au/grants">Lotterywest grant</a> for $371,855 by the Hon. Minister Simone McGurk MLA to allow them to restore the 1955 built <a href="https://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/news-and-media/18112019-lotterywest-grant-kulunga-kindergarten">Kulunga Aboriginal Kindergarten</a> in Hilton, Western Australia to create a community hub for parenting services, training, playgroups and an inclusive space for locals to utilise.</i>
      </h3>
      <p>Ms McGurk, State Member for Fremantle and Minister for Child Protection; Women’s Interests; Prevention of Family and Domestic Violence; Community Services attended the ‘Meet your Neighbour’ event to announce the grant, alongside the <a href="https://www.wapcyc.com.au/">PCYC</a>, <a href="https://www.hiltonps.wa.edu.au/">Hilton Primary School</a>, the <a href="https://hilton.freospace.com.au/">Hilton Precinct,</a> and the <a href="https://www.agedcareonline.com.au/residential-aged-care/western-australia/hilton?range=10">Hilton Aged Care Home</a>.</p>
      <p>In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.fremantle.wa.gov.au/">City of Fremantle</a>, local organisations and businesses, and in consultation with local Elders, Meerilinga said their aim is to create a welcoming environment in line with community needs. Local contractors will make the purpose built building once again fit for use and will recreate the outdoor nature play environment.</p>
      <p>Minister McGurk said the restoration of the Kulunga Aboriginal Kindergarten would be a great boost for Meerilinga Young Children’s Foundation.</p>
      <p>“The Meerilinga Foundation is active in a number of areas, including parenting services and community neighbourhood and development services,” she said.</p>
      <p>Meerilinga CEO Lesley Moreschi said “We are thrilled to receive this grant from Lotterywest. The transformation of the Kulunga Kindergarten will allow the character of the building to remain but will ensure that the building is safe for use. This will allow us to extend our services to Hilton and the surrounding community, and will also enable us to provide a space for residents use.”</p>
      <p>She thanked Lotterywest for their funding, as well as the City of Fremantle for their generosity in allowing them to lease the building, given its “rich history.”</p>
      <p>The Kulunga Kindergarten which was previously home to a preschool program for three and four year old Aboriginal children, and was closed in 2014 due to lack of government funding, a Meerilinga spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Updates on the renovation process will be available via the <a href="http://www.meerilinga.org.au/">Meerilinga website</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Meerilinga">social media channels</a>.</p>
