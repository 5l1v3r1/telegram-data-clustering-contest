      <p>New Toronto Maple Leafs coach Sheldon Keefe spent a decent chunk of a 30-minute morning skate on Thursday teaching instead of running drills.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot for his new team to learn and not much time to do it.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old Keefe is now in charge of the Maple Leafs after veteran coach Mike Babcock was fired Wednesday with the team mired in a six-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Keefe was officially introduced Thursday morning as the 31st head coach in Maple Leafs history. He’s got a long history with general manager Kyle Dubas, who hopes Keefe is the right choice to help Toronto bounce back from a disappointing 9-10-4 start.</p>
      <p>Keefe believes it can be done.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a lot of talent and the ability to make life hard on the other team in a lot of ways,” he said. “Focusing on that, we believe, will produce positive results. Because the players are good enough for that to happen.”</p>
      <p>Keefe will make his coaching debut during Toronto’s game against the Arizona Coyotes on Thursday night.</p>
