      <p>The digital world is evolving at a rapid pace – what’s relevant one day is old news by the next. That’s why, for today’s businesses, the question is no longer whether or not digital transformation should take place – it’s a question of how quickly organisations can make it happen.</p>

      <p>Businesses need to constantly transform their operating models, digitise their products and prepare for an increasingly connected world if they want to benefit from connectivity-dependent platforms and applications. Social media, data analytics, IoT and AI are just beginning to reveal the kind of efficiency, consumer service and growth that organisations are capable of.</p>
      <p>In South Africa alone, it’s reported business owners believe by 2024, as much as 50% of their revenue will be driven by digital changes to their businesses – and 76% of employees think their company is on the right path for digital transformation.</p>
      <p>However, simply implementing a transformation strategy is not enough. Businesses need to have a clear understanding of what connectivity will achieve and exactly what advanced technology it’ll need to make this possible – or risk ending up with a mediocre set of systems that fail to unlock the businesses potential.</p>
      <p>“Whether a company chooses to use cognitive artificial intelligence-driven chatbots to service and support clients, drones for delivery or operations and maintenance purposes, IoT based applications to evolve their physical product-based portfolio to a digital services based portfolio, VR technology for organisational training or technical support services, the foundational requirements will be the same,” says Vino Govender, acting CSO at Dark Fibre Africa.</p>
      <p>“The digital platforms that deliver these services require reliable, high-speed connectivity. This is where fibre, with its capability to support significant data traffic, fibre has emerged as a key enabler of a connected digital world. The open-access model for fibre connectivity services also reduces the cost-barrier for service providers in delivering digital services since they these services do not require them to invest in network infrastructure, and they can benefit from the economies of scale are achieved by a wholesale open-access provider.”</p>
      <p>With the connectivity landscape constantly changing, South African businesses need to ramp up their digital transformation efforts. Business leaders should quickly learn that their journey towards a more connected and efficient model is never over as long as new technologies are revealed. And more than that, it’ll be nearly impossible to deploy these future technologies without high-speed connectivity and the infrastructure that supports it.</p>
