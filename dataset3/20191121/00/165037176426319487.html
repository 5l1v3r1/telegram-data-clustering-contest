      <h1>Emery: "Xhaka could return this weekend"</h1>

        <b>Arsenal face Southampton this Saturday and an under pressure Unai Emery has stated that Granit Xhaka could return to the Arsenal team, despite recently claiming that he didn't know if the former captain would play for the club again.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/g-xhaka-67187/">Granit Xhaka</a> has not played for Arsenal since his <b>angry confrontation with fans after he was substituted off</b> in last month's game against Crystal Palace. He was subsequently also stripped of the captaincy.</p>
      <p>Despite not featuring in any of the 'Gunners' last four games and Emery stating that he didn't know if he would play for them again, <b>Emery feels Xhaka is now ready to return:</b> "We will decide on Friday" he said.</p>
      <p>"He is coming back better in his mind,<b> his mindset is better to help us </b>and to be closer to playing when we need him."</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Playing Xhaka in a match at the Emirates Stadium would <b>seem a considerable risk</b> given <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/arsenal/">Arsenal'</a>s current situation: <b>struggling for form and badly in need of three points </b>from the league’s 19th-placed side. But Emery did not entirely rule out springing a surprise and involving the player in some capacity.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to him this morning and we had a very good conversation.<b> He trained very well before the international break </b>and he trained very well this morning".</p>
      <p><b>"My objective is going to be his comeback</b> to help us and convince every supporter of his commitment with us and his performances will be better and <b>they will be proud of him in the short or long future </b>with us." He added. </p>
