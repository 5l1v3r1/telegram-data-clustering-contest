      <h4>Robin Givens is lifting the lid on what dating Brad Pitt was really like, way before the star became the Hollywood hunk that we know and love.</h4>
      <p>It’s the question that <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/?s=robin+givens"><b>Robin Givens</b></a> is constantly asked: What was it like to date <b>Brad Pitt</b>? Back in the 1980s – before either of them were big stars – the 54-year-old <i>Ambitions</i> actress and the future father-of-six struck up a romance. They were both in their 20s, trying to make their mark in Hollywood. She was making a name for herself as a co-star in the sitcom <i>Head of the Class</i> and Brad was a few years away from becoming a household name thanks to his unforgettable sexy shirtless scene in 1991’s <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>. “It’s such a long time ago,” Robin said during an EXCLUSIVE interview with <b>HollywoodLife</b> while promoting her OWN drama, <i>Ambitions</i>, on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>“He was always such a wonderful person,” she added, before revealing how they met. “It’s so funny. We met in acting class. I was doing <i>Head of the Class</i>. We really both loved acting. He couldn’t get a job.” Robin remembered that when Brad, now 55, finally booked a gig he was “so excited.”</p>
      <p>Coincidentally the two acting students got a chance to work on the same show professionally. “We were in acting class and then he was booked on <i>Head of the Class</i>, which is how we met the second time. I was like, ‘Wait, you were just in Tuesday’s acting class.’”</p>

      <p>Robin and Brad’s lives went into different directions. She married boxing champ <b>Mike Tyson</b> who alleged in his 2013 memoir, <i>Undisputed Truth</i>, that he found his wife and the heartthrob in bed together. Robin, however, <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/06/10/robin-givens-brad-pitt-relationship-mike-tyson-book-wwhl-interview/">denied this ever happened</a> during a June 2019 appearance on<i> Watch What Happens Live</i>. Tyson and Robin divorced in 1989 and she went on to marry tennis instructor<b> Svetozar Marinkovic</b> in 1997, but they split after a year’s marriage.</p>
      <p>Brad went on to date celebs like <b>Juliette Lewis</b> and <b>Gwyneth Paltrow</b>, before marrying and divorcing <b>Jennifer Aniston</b> and <b>Angelina Jolie</b>, with whom he has six children. Robin, who is now mom to two sons – <b>Michael</b>, 27, and <b>William</b>, 20 – hasn’t spoken to or seen her ex in years. She did see him on the big screen in <b>Quentin Tarantino’s</b> summer hit, <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i> and – like everyone else on the planet – she thinks Brad looks great. “I loved it. I thought he looked really good,” she said, adding, “I love people when they get <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/brad-pitt-then-now-photos/">better with time</a> because, in a way, from the inside you want to get better. So you want the outside to kind of last as you’re figuring it out.”</p>
      <p>Robin stars as scheming lawyer Stephanie Lancaster in <i>Ambitions</i>, which airs on OWN on Tuesday nights at 10pm.</p>
