        <b>Update #1, 2:42 pm: </b>
        <i>Vucevic will miss at least four weeks with his ankle injury, </i>

        <i> reports. That will put him in position to return in mid-December at the earliest.</i>
      </p>
      <p>The Orlando Magic lost Nikola Vucevic in the middle of their Wednesday night game against the Toronto Raptors when the 29-year-old hit the deck with a sprained right ankle.</p>
      <p>Vucevic was promptly ruled out for the game after landing awkwardly on a block attempt and was later seen leaving the arena with crutches and a walking boot.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDenton555/status/1197352055188406272">John Denton of the Magic’s official team site</a> reports that initial x-rays on the big man’s foot came back negative but that they’ll await the results of an MRI on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Vucevic has been a dominant force for the Magic this season, averaging 17.1 points and 11.6 rebounds per game over the course of the 14 tilts he’s played in so far this season.</p>
      <p>Any extended absence for Vucevic will presumably thrust reserve Mo Bamba and Khem Birch into larger roles.</p>
