        <b>According to both 'Mundo Deportivo' and 'Il Corriere dello Sport', Juventus are studying ways to make room for Ivan Rakitic, who Ernesto Valverde doesn't seem to rely on.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/i-rakitic-2139">Rakitic</a> is not the one from other seasons. The Croatian, who before, was a key man at Barca, has hardly been given any game time this season.</p>
      <p>The midfielder does not fit in to the <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/barcelona">Barcelona</a> squad and has even been linked with a possible exit <b>in winter,</b> although this option <b>seems difficult</b> in face of the obstacles that Barcelona could put in the way.</p>

      <p>So far this season, the number '4' has played only <b>10 games and had a total of 255 minutes</b>, which shows that the coach has his eyes fixed on other players.</p>
      <p>Rakitic has stated<b> how sad hs is in an interview and <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> seem ready to take over.</b> In Italy, they are excited because the Croatian's priority is Juventus, as 'Sport' indicates.</p>
      <p>However, Bar√ßa won't make his exit any easier. According to 'MD' and 'Il Corriere dello Sport',<b> Juventus are studying formulas to lighten the squad </b>(free salary) and give entry to a footballer who isn't likely to feature more in Barca's squad anytime soon.</p>
