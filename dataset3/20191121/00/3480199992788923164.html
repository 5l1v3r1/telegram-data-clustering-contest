      <p>Signed “Chan&amp;Jenna”, they said there were “no secrets or salacious events at the root of our decision – just two best friends realising it’s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible”.</p>
      <p>Since the split, Tatum has started dating British singer Jessie J, while Dewan recently announced she is expecting her first child with partner and actor Steve Kazee.</p>
