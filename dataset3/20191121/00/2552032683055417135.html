      <p>Stephen Biegun, Washington’s top envoy for North Korea and the nominee for deputy secretary of state, spoke Thursday of the need for a “renewal” of the Seoul-Washington alliance, a South Korean lawmaker said.</p>
      <p>Rep. Na Kyung-won, floor leader of the main opposition Liberty Korea Party, told reporters after meeting with Biegun that she interpreted his remarks as a call for Seoul to increase its financial contribution to the upkeep of 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea.</p>
      <p>Na was in Washington as part of a bipartisan parliamentary delegation to deliver South Korea’s concern about U.S. demands for a sharp increase in its share of the defense costs.</p>
      <p>The meeting was also attended by Reps. Lee In-young and Oh Shin-hwan, floor leaders of the ruling Democratic Party and minor opposition Bareunmirae Party, respectively.</p>
      <p>“Special Representative Biegun used the expression, ‘renewal of the South Korea-U.S. alliance,’ to describe (the current conditions vis-a-vis) 1950,” Na said, referring to the year the Korean War broke out with the U.S. fighting on South Korea’s side.</p>
      <p>“I believe he meant that these (cost-sharing negotiations) should be viewed inside the framework of a new alliance,” she said.</p>
      <p>Oh added that Biegun projected a difficult set of negotiations ahead.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers said they stated Seoul’s position that it will not be able to accept excessive demands from Washington and called for “fair and reasonable” negotiations based on a foundation of respect and trust.</p>
      <p>They also said they asked Biegun to work to strengthen the alliance if confirmed as the No. 2 State Department official.</p>
