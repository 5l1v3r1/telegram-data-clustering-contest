      <h1>LaVar Arrington Speaks On Tom Brady Telling Antonio Brown To Send Out Apology To Patriots (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:12:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:12</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>This is an interesting theory.</p>
      <p>On Twitter and Instagram, Antonio Brown dropped a shocking apology to team owner Robert Kraft that came on the heels of Brady voicing his frustration about the offense’s performance during New England’s 17-10 win over the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
      <p>Brady was among several Patriots players who liked Brown’s Instagram post.</p>
      <p>That led to former NFL linebacker LaVar Arrington to come up with an interesting conspiracy theory on FS1’s “Speak For Yourself” where he presented the idea that Brady lobbied for Brown to send out that apology.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t genuine yet it was put out there and liked by multiple players, none bigger than the name of one Tom Brady,” Arrington, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, explained. “Let’s add on to this: Baltimore thrashed (the Patriots), showed them that they did not have enough talent. There’s a possibility he could be able to play, there’s a possibility he could be ruled out, but yet we saw a dejected Tom Brady after a victory because he didn’t have what he wanted, right? I’m sitting here conspiracy theory. Here’s the sizzle in your spirit type deal: Tom Brady told him to send that tweet out. Tom Brady is trying to direct getting AB back in the mitts of that New England Patriots organization. “There’s something here,” Arrington added.</p>
      <p>“Tom Brady is lobbying to get AB back on his team.”</p>

      <p>His allegations weren’t a problem for the Patriots, but he left them no choice after text messages were published showing him harassing a second female accuser and bringing up her kids while he was in the Patriots facility.</p>
      <p>Brown caught four passes for 56 yards with a touchdown in his only game with the Patriots, a Week 2 win over the Miami Dolphins.</p>
