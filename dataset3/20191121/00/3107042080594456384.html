      <h1>The moment a grandmother was carjacked</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.odt.co.nz/author/sophie.cornish%40starmedia.kiwi" target="_blank">Sophie Cornish</a></address>
      <p>This dramatic photo shows the moment a woman in her 70s was allegedly carjacked in a suburban Christchurch street on Monday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The woman was pulled from her SUV in Reynolds Ave, Bishopdale, after delivering flyers as part of her work in the community.</p>
      <p>The photo was taken by a passing motorist.</p>
      <p>Her grandson Jordan Kidd, 22, told starnews.co.nz his nana was shaken after being pulled from her car, which was then stolen.</p>
      <p>“She told me she got into her car and heard yelling at the door, telling her to ‘get the f**k out of the car’ and then next thing she knows the door’s open and they are taking her out of it,” he said.</p>
      <p>It was the second alleged carjacking in about an hour by two men, the first one taking place at the intersection of Langdons Rd and Morrison Ave, Northcote.</p>
      <p>The offenders then crashed the vehicle on Reynolds Ave and went searching for another, when they came across Mr Kidd’s nana.</p>
      <p>One alleged offender, Jared Robert Fuller, a 26-year-old labourer from Kaiapoi, handed himself in to police on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>His alleged co-offender, who Detective Sergeant Brad Grainger said may face more charges relating to another series of offending, was still on the run on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Mr Kidd was heading home from work on Monday when his ex-girlfriend rang him after seeing photos of the incident online and recognising the vehicle.</p>
      <p>“I couldn’t believe it, I was so bloody mad at these guys. I saw the photos of them, they aren’t small people, and they are fully grown men picking on the weak," he said.</p>
      <p>“I did a quick U-turn to head out to where it happened but I couldn’t find nana anywhere.</p>
      <p>"She gave me a call later that night to say she had been at the police station and to say she was okay, just a bit shaken up.</p>
      <p>“She hasn’t left her bed since really, she was ill already."</p>
      <p>His nana’s car, which she relies on to look after her nephew with Down’s syndrome, was found abandoned near the Waimakariri Gorge bridge.</p>
      <p>Fuller has been charged with two charges of aggravated robbery of vehicles, unlawfully getting into a vehicle and another of driving while disqualified.</p>
      <p>He appeared in the district court on Wednesday and was bailed on strict conditions.</p>
      <p>Detective Sergeant Grainger said inquiries are continuing to locate his co-offender and further charges will be laid.</p>
      <p>So far five victims have come forward and made complaints about incidents on Monday, which police believe may be related to the two men.</p>
