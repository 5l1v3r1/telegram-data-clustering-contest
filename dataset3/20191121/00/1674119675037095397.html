        <b>Chris Berrow and Leigh Milner review Bee Simulator. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Leigh - This could have been really good. This could have been an amazing thing. And if you did give me money to make this it would be the best b experience. What would you do right. You are you. You expect to be a right in a very busy park or you know in the middle of New York London which you are. Okay. And you've got to try and avoid the rain drops and people getting cups of coffee down and avoid the cars. I flew into a car. You do it to get your beads of dye and it won't die. And the graphics when really not very good. The graphics were poor. You literally can't fly the bee. You found the control and I found the controls really jerky really difficult you can't look and fly at the same time. If they should be able to give them the controls that they or you do in this game is your a bee and you have to collect honey.</p>
