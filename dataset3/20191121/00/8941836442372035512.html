      <p>DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) - The California Horse Racing Board has chosen a longtime veterinarian as its new chairman.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gregory-ferraro/">Gregory Ferraro</a> was elected Thursday during the board’s meeting at Del Mar racetrack north of San Diego. He was appointed to the governing body five months ago by Gov. Gavin Newsom.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gregory-ferraro/">Ferraro</a> noted the board has a mandate from Newsom’s office to focus on the health and safety of horses in the wake of 37 horse deaths at Santa Anita since last December.</p>
      <p>“We have made several important new regulations and changes. There are many more to come,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gregory-ferraro/">Ferraro</a> said. “We will gradually eliminate medication. We expect opposition to many of these, but we are determined to carry them out.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/gregory-ferraro/">Ferraro</a> served as director of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine Center for Equine Health from 1997 to 2014. He owned his veterinary practice from 1972 to 1997. He earned a doctor of veterinary medicine degree from UC Davis and is a member of the American Association of Equine Practitioners and the American Veterinary Medical Association.</p>
