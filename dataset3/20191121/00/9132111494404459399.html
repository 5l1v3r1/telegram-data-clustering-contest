      <p>In a not so surprising turn of events, vehicles and some properties of residents of Dzorwulu and Kaneshie first light have been swept away following torrential rain on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The downpour which lasted a little over 3 hours created a dense pool of water around the Kaneshie First Light area, bringing commercial activities to a halt.</p>
      <p>In a footage sighted by GhanaWeb, a number of cars and stalls of traders have been submerged in the floodwaters. Several other items are seen floating and being carried away.</p>
      <p>The situation is not any different at Dzorwulu. In a separate video, a resident who is trapped in his car as it appears submerged shot the scene as the water impeded him from entering his house.</p>
      <p>Traders along the road have had their wares either soaked or carried away.</p>
      <p>The incidence of flooding is not new to the two aforementioned areas but the situation seems to be worsening with every downpour.</p>
