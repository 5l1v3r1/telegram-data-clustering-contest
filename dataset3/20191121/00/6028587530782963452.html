      <p>Boston-based Fidelity Investments became one of the early believers in the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency, going so far as to launch a subsidiary company Fidelity Digital Assets. This branch of the major Investment company has now been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-crypto-currency-fidelity/fidelitys-crypto-company-secures-new-york-state-license-idUSKBN1XT24C">granted</a> a license by New York's financial regulator.The license allows the company to offer its cryptocurrency trading and custody services to companies based in the State, something that has not been easy to do in the past. New York and its notorious BitLicense, the common term used for a business license of virtual currency activities, issued in the State, have caused many crypto-focused businesses to look elsewhere.</p>
      <p>However, this has left a rather large gap in a prime market for cryptocurrency businesses. The issue is that the regulations in New York surrounding cryptocurrency activities have set a high benchmark that many smaller companies struggle with. </p>
      <p>In fact, when the BitLicense decision came into play in 2015, there was an exodus of businesses that was <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2015/08/12/the-great-bitcoin-exodus-has-totally-changed-new.html">labeled</a> the 'Great Bitcoin Exodus' by the New York Business Journal. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Chasing demand</b>
      </p>
      <p>For Fidelity Digital Assets, the aim of achieving this license in New York was to meet the high demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the State.</p>
      <p>"We have experienced a high interest level from these firms and anticipate that their increased involvement in this industry would enable more activities and development across the spectrum," the company <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/enabling-institutions-to-access-new-medium-for-assets">said in a blog post</a>.</p>
      <p>The demand is growing and evolving in the cryptocurrency ecosystem; no longer is it speculating individual investors, but rather institutions and enterprises. </p>
      <p>"The custody and trade execution services that we provide are essential building blocks for institutional investors' continued adoption of digital assets," <a href="https://www.fidelitydigitalassets.com/articles/enabling-institutions-to-access-new-medium-for-assets">said</a> Michael O'Reilly, CEO of Fidelity Digital Assets. </p>
      <p>"The designation as a New York Trust Company under the supervision and examination of the DFS builds on the credibility and trust we're establishing amongst institutions and other market participants. We will continue to play a leading role in supporting the maturation of the entire ecosystem as we expand our business and the clients we serve."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Not the first of its kind</b>
      </p>
      <p>While Fidelity was certainly one of the earlier major investment houses to support cryptocurrency, it is not the only one today. Back in 2017, Fidelity CEO Abigail Johnson admitted that the company was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/28/fidelity-ceo-abigail-johnson-says-the-company-is-mining-cryptocurrencies/">mining cryptocurrency</a> and that their cryptocurrency branch started as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ca95d640-f0b6-11e9-ad1e-4367d8281195">'a bit of fun.'</a></p>
      <p>Now, Fidelity is rubbing shoulders with Intercontinental Exchange Inc, the owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and CME Group Inc, who are both in the cryptocurrency ecosystem with futures contracts on Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>There has been much growth and success with the futures contracts being offered by such major institutional financial companies with <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/content/dam/cmegroup/market-regulation/rule-filings/2019/9/19-334.pdf">CME pushing</a> to meet demand, and ICE's <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bakkt-bitcoin-futures-contracts-top-10-million-in-daily-volume-again/">Baakt also growing recently</a>.</p>
