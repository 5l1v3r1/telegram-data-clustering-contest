      <p>There are certain positions with the Yankees that offer a lineage or a special place indicating the long and storied history. One position is center field with its lineage from Joe DiMaggio to Mickey Mantle to Bernie Williams.Another is first base and maybe even more than center field, when you consider the total amount of players who held the job on a regular basis for at least five seasons. Hal Chase held it for eight seasons from 1905 to 1912, Wally Pipp had it for 10 from 1915 to 1924 and Lou Gehrig had it for 15 seasons from 1925 to 1938.</p>
      <p>The lineage of first baseman includes recent times as well for the Yankees. Bob Watson, John Mayberry and Ken Griffey were the regular first baseman following the seven-year run of Chris Chambliss from 1974 to 1980. They wound up bridging to gap from Chambliss to Don Mattingly.</p>
      <p>Mattingly held the position on a regular basis for 13 seasons until finally making the playoffs in 1995. Then came six seasons of Tino Martinez, seven seasons of Jason Giambi and eight seasons of Mark Teixeira.</p>
      <p>By the time Teixeira was approaching the end of his tenure in New York, the Yankees thought they had the next person to be a long-term first baseman in Greg Bird, but after numerous injuries, he was designated for assignment ahead of the deadline to add players for the 40-man roster Wednesday night meaning he likely will become a former Yankee.</p>
      <p>Bird flew into the New York scene on Aug. 13, 2015 and when he did he was the Yankees’ fourth-ranked prospect</p>
      <p>A lot of the talk about the Yankees’ young position player core revolves around Aaron Judge, Gary Sanchez, Gleyber Torres and Miguel Andujar. It was Bird who was the first one to arrive and it is Bird, who is the first one to exit and it is a quiet departure since it was part of a series of transactions that involved the Yankees releasing Jacoby Ellsbury and showing a willingness to eat the $26 million for the center fielder, whose last appearance was as a pinch runner in Game 4 of the 2017 ALCS.</p>
      <p>At the time when the Yankees called Bird up, they just lost their grip on the AL East with a three-game sweep by the hard-charging Toronto Blue Jays. A few weeks later Teixeira would be injured for the rest of the season and Bird was getting his first chance at becoming the next name to the first base lineage.</p>
      <p>When the Yankees called him up, this is how former manager Joe Girardi described him:</p>
      <p>“You hear people use the term, 'professional hitter,'" Girardi said. "He knows how to hit the ball to all fields, he knows how to drive the ball, he knows how to drive in runs; you know, he's had a pretty successful Minor League career hitting the ball."</p>
      <p>That was after GM Brian Cashman referred to Bird as “by far” the team’s best hitter among its minor leagues in spring training 2015.</p>
      <p>Bird showed flashes of living up to Cashman and Girardi’s words over the final six weeks of the 2015 season as the Yankees finished with 87 wins and qualified for the wild-card game. He batted .261 with 11 homers and 31 RBIs in 46 games while posting an OPS of .872. Prorated over a 162-game season, Bird was on pace to hit 39 homers and drive in 109 runs.</p>
      <p>Except Bird never got the chance at a full season because injuries always got in the way. Right Shoulder surgery cost him all of 2016 when the Yankees began making the transition to Judge and Sanchez while also acquiring Torres.</p>
      <p>In 2017, he was limited to 47 games due to ankle surgery. He homered off Adam Wainwright on April 16, 2017 and then did not return until the end of August. Still he wound saving the Yankees season in Game 3 of the ALDS with a homer off Andrew Miller in a 1-0 game.</p>
      <p>Then came 2018 and this time foot surgery got in the way even though Bird played a career-high 82 games. However, he hit .199 despite hitting 11 homers and the Yankees acquired Luke Voit on July 28.</p>
      <p>Coincidentally, Bird hit a game-tying homer against the Royals on the night the Yankees acquired Voit. He hit only two more homers the rest of the season and his average steadily declined from the .237 mark he held on July 28.</p>
      <p>Last season, Bird competed with Voit for the first base job and both were on the opening day roster. In fact, Bird and Voit hit the first two of the Yankees’ record-setting 306 homers in the opening day win over Baltimore.</p>
      <p>Bird wound up getting only 41 plate appearances before going down with a left plantar fascia tear and spent the rest of the season recovering from the latest injury.</p>
      <p>Bird’s extensive injury history is a great unknown as to whether he could actually put together a full season of production. His bat showed tantalizing signs that it could at times, it just seems it likely will be somewhere else after years of crushing injuries.</p>
