      <p>Tekashi 6ix9ine May Just Be Getting Out SOON!</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors) </b>I am sick of these rumors around Tekashi 69. But this is the job! So, let us continue on with the rumors surrounding Tekashi. The latest rumor is that the boy is going to be out before Christmas! They may just let him loose so he can get his daughter some toys! But, I wouldn't mind if he was out and about, because I want to see how the story ends. Not to say that it will end...so lets say "the next chapter."</p>
      <p>But the word is they are going to get him home within 30 days! Can you believe that? This is what snitching gets you vs football numbers in jail. I think they have successfully broken down the greatness of crime! I don't do crime, but if you do, you should certainly be "bout that life" enough that you just do the time when you get caught. </p>
      <p>Tekkie's girl, Jade has allegedly reported that her man will. be home next month - December!</p>
      <p>The other rumor is that Tekkie will have an armada of security and guess who will provide it? The same dudes that keep Floyd Mayweather safe and sounds are the same dudes that will reportedly protect Tekashi 69 from the clutches of bangers that want revenge. I am not sure if that is going to be enough, but it is definitely going to cost him a TON of money!</p>
      <p>And while this sounds like some breaking news, it ain't. Last year, when he was free, 69 was using the boxer's old guys. I guess only the best will suit the best! </p>
