      <p>The market ended November 21 marginally lower, squandering a positive start as selling pressure during the day didn't allow the bulls to take charge of Dalal Street.</p>
      <p>The Nifty closed at 11,968.40, with a loss of 31 points or 0.26 percent. It formed a bearish candle after the Doji formation of a day earlier, failing to hold above 12,000-mark.</p>
      <p>The repeated inability of the market to sustain above 12k level may be hinting at an impending weakness, which will be confirmed on a close below 11,896 levels, experts say.</p>
      <p>"A strong close above 12,038 shall negate the current bearish view by extending the strength towards 12,103 levels," said Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist â€“ Technical Research &amp; Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in.</p>
      <p>"For the time being, traders are advised to remain neutral long side, where fresh shorting can be considered below 11,896 levels on closing basis," he added.</p>
      <p>India VIX fell by 1.22% at 14.97 levels. Now, VIX needs to continue to hold below 15 zones to surpass the recent highs.</p>
      <p>Maximum Put open interest is at 11,900 followed by 11,800 strike, while maximum Call OI is at 12,000 followed by 12,200 strike.</p>
      <p>Some Put writing was seen at 12,000 and 11,900 strikes; while Call writing was visible in 12,000-12,200 strikes. The options data suggests a broader trading range between 11,800 and 12,200.</p>
      <p>The Bank Nifty continued to hold above 31,200 levels for the second consecutive session and formed a small red-bodied candle on the daily scale. It is making higher lows for the fifth consecutive session and ended the session on a flat note.</p>
      <p>"Till it holds above 31,200 levels, we may see an extension in ongoing optimism towards 31,500 then 31750 levels; while downside supports are placed at 31000 then 30800 zones," said Chandan Taparia, Vice President | Analyst-Derivatives at Motilal Oswal Financial Services, said.</p>
