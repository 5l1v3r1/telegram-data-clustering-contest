      <h1>Sagay Confirms Arrest Of former Attorney General, Adoke, Speaks On Why He Was Arrested</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Faderera Falade</a></address>
      <p>The Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee against Corruption, Prof. <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/itse-sagay/"><u>Itse Sagay</u></a>, has confirmed the arrest of the former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, <b><a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/mohammed-adoke/"><u>Mohammed Adoke</u></a></b>.</p>
      <p>Sagay confirmed the arrest during a courtesy visit to the headquarters of the <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/topic/efcc/"><u><b>Economic</b> and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)</u></a> yesterday, November 20th.</p>
      <p>He said the arrest is the latest success in the fight against corruption under the federal government.</p>
      <p>Sagay said “<i>Adoke is facing criminal charges bordering on alleged abuse of office and money laundering with respect to the granting of the Oil Prospecting License (OPL) 245 to Shell and ENI, brought against him and four others by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. His arrest follows a warrant issued by a Federal Capital Territory High Court in Abuja requested by the EFCC”</i></p>
      <p>He said the Buhari-led Federal Government is supporting the fight against corruption, to the fightback from its beneficiaries.</p>
      <p>“<i>The former attorney General Adoke has been arrested in Dubai. It’s a continuous thing, so when Nigerians pretend and say what is the difference this government has brought into the fight against corruption, what has been achieved? There is no difference, it amazes me. For me, it’s a sign of patent bad faith being expressed by the elite who were the beneficiaries of corruption.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“They are undergoing the pains of having to earn their living, rather than simply collecting easy money where people were building edifices without any sign of employment of any sort. There has been a lot of change and the EFCC activities are responsible for most of this change.”</i>
