      <p>In his welcoming address, the Ya Naa thanked Dr Daniel McKorley and the McDan Foundation for the honour done to Dagbon by sponsoring the Damba Festival with cash and assorted gifts and prayed for Allah to bless and prosper the business of McDan Group.</p>

Education is of strategic importance to every Nation and it is critical we all support the Government by contributing our quota to empowering more Children especially in deprived communities to acquire relevant knowledge and skill set for national development”.</p>
      <p>He encouraged the youth to take their education very serious as the future is open to people with the right attitude and skill set. He assured the Ya Naa of his resolve to complete the entire building project within 90 days and encouraged the School authorities to co-operate with the Contractor for a successful project.</p>
