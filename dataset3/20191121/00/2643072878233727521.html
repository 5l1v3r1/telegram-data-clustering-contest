      <p>The General Overseer of Omega Fire Ministries (OFM) Apostle Johnson Suleman, has revealed that he would be launching a mobile network in the United Kingdom (UK).</p>
      <p>Naija News reports that the Apostle disclosed this on the micro-blogging site, Twitter on Thursday afternoon, November 21</p>
      <p>“Pray along with us as we launch our our mobile network in United kingdom…coming soon,” Apostle Suleman tweeted.</p>

      <p>Although the clergyman solicited for prayers ahead of the launch of the mobile network, he, however, refused to reveal when the mobile network will be launched neither did he reveal the name of the network.</p>
      <p>Apart from presiding over his church, Naija News understands that Apostle Suleman is a business man who is into oil and gas as well as the media industry.</p>
      <p>Based on this, it is, however, unclear if the Apostle will be launching the mobile network as an individual or it is a project which will be excited by OFM (his church).</p>
