      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo 'to leave Juventus if they don't win Champions League'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cristiano-ronaldo/"><b>Cristiano Ronaldo</b></a> will allegedly look to sign for another club if <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> do not win this season's Champions League.</h2>

      <p>Having won the trophy with Manchester United and Real Madrid, the Portugal international is hoping to win the competition with a third different club.</p>
      <p>However, journalist <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eduardo-inda/"><b>Eduardo Inda</b></a> has suggested that the 34-year-old may leave the Italian giants if they do not end their 24-year wait for European football's top prize.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>Chiringuito De Jugones</i>, Inda said: "Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Juventus at the end of the current season if they do not win the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"He went to Turin to try and win the Champions League with a third different club but things are getting complicated.</p>
      <p>"Juventus want to sign [Paul] Pogba and [Kylian] Mbappe. I think it is going to be difficult for them, especially the second one. Due to the salary limits, if they want to sign these players they would have to allow for Ronaldo's exit from the club so it is becoming a very likely outcome."</p>
      <p>Ronaldo still has over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract with the Serie A leaders.</p>
