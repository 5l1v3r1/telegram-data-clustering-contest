      <h3>The Giants have opted for an internal candidate to fill the crucial football operations boss chasm, with Jason McCartney stepping up into the role effective immediately.</h3>
      <p>McCartney on Thursday was announced as the Giants’ new football operations manager after two seasons as the club’s list manager.</p>
      <p>The appointment comes almost four weeks after <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/teams/greater-western-sydney-giants/gws-said-their-footy-boss-wayne-campbell-was-rock-solid-he-just-left-the-building/news-story/33350d5c4d09f51eb6ebf5d131cd2c36">Wayne Campbell resigned from his post</a>, despite having a year to run on his contract.

      <p>It’s understood Campbell had a tense relationship with chief executive Dave Matthews, as well as several key players including vice-captain Stephen Coniglio.</p>
      <p>While he was list manager, McCartney, along with Matthews, handled the vast majority of contract negotiations in 2019, allowing Campbell to focus on other areas of the footy department.</p>
      <p>Matthews said McCartney was ideally placed to step up into the new role.</p>
      <p>“Following the conclusion of the 2019 AFL season we carefully assessed the structure of our football department and have identified enhanced performance in a number of key areas,” Matthews said in a statement.</p>

      <p>“Jason McCartney brings a wealth of experience to this new role and he has done an outstanding job overseeing player retention and acquisition. Jason’s existing relationships with our playing group, coaching staff and wider football department staff sees him well placed to ensure a smooth leadership transition as we head towards the 2020 AFL and AFLW seasons.</p>
      <p>“We wish Wayne Campbell the best for the future and thank him for his contribution since joining the club at the start of the 2016 AFL season.”</p>
      <p>McCartney joined the Giants in 2017 after a stint as Western Bulldogs list manager, which included the 2016 premiership year. Previously he held coaching roles at Fremantle and the AFL/AIS Academy.</p>
      <p>McCartney played 182 AFL games for Collingwood, Adelaide and North Melbourne.</p>
      <p>He famously and emotionally returned to the Kangaroos for a farewell game in 2003, less than seven months after he was caught up in the 2002 Bali bombings and suffered severe second degree burns to over 50 per cent of his body.</p>
