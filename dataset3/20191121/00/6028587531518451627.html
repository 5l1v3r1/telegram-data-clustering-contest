      <h1>Why Marie Kondo's E-Commerce Strategy Does Not Spark Joy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Syama Meagher</a></address>
      <p>I'm not afraid to admit it: I own a copy of <i>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</i>, and I love it. Marie Kondo is a household name for good reason. Her book is an international bestseller and on its 55th printing with over 1.5 million copies sold. She's beloved by her fans, and the star of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvyeapVBLWY">Netflix series</a>. And she <a href="https://time.com/3822899/marie-kondo-2015-time-100/">was even named</a> among 2015's Top Influential People by Time Magazine. </p>
      <p>It's without a doubt that KonMari, her signature tidying-up method, has helped countless Americans organize and declutter their lives. But Kondo's real gift is teaching us to confront our emotional relationships to stuff and to find joy and peace of mind along the way. </p>
      <p>Only keep items that "spark joy," she says. It's a wholesome impulse. And, what sparks joy for me might not work for you. You may be decluttering, but in the process, you're learning a bit more about yourself.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, I was shocked to learn that Kondo launched an e-commerce platform on her site. Was the Queen of less-is-more really selling us... more stuff? </p>
      <p>At first, I was curious. Perhaps Kondo's store would feature a beautiful capsule collection or be filled with modular, functional items that would simplify my life even more. Sitting in bed with my laptop, I found myself laughing with astonishment. </p>
      <p>In <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/">The Shop at KonMari</a>, I found a $275 Brass Tool Holder, $206 Leather Room Shoes, and a $108 Body Brush. There's even a hand-carved <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/bath-essentials/products/konmari-bath-tosaryu-shiatsu-stick">Shiatsu Stick</a> at a (comparingly) affordable $12. </p>
      <p>Marie, I'm not mad. I'm disappointed. </p>
      <p>Sure enough, the backlash has been quick <a href="https://news.avclub.com/marie-kondo-betrays-her-whole-premise-by-launching-e-co-1839960688">and brutal</a>. But I'm not here to condemn Kondo for sprinkling the capitalist way onto her Eastern philosophies—she's running a business, after all, and who can fault her for that? </p>
      <p>"Many people have asked what I use in my everyday life," <a href="https://twitter.com/MarieKondo/status/1196853386273906688">she tweeted.</a> "This online shop is a collection of my favorite things and items that spark joy." Many have been quick to point out how Kondo's e-commerce store couldn't be more of an antithesis to her philosophy. They're right—the heart of Kondo's books and teachings is a democratized approach to self-discovery. It's about joy, not stuff. Did Kondo think her audience would get behind this? What do her fans—the Midwestern families, the Gen Z college kids—have to learn from purchasing her high-end, handcrafted things?  </p>
      <p>Here's the thing: It's not even the hypocrisy that bothers me: It's the business strategy. </p>
      <p>Kondo has it all wrong. Instead of valuing the community that her brand has cultivated, Kondo has gone and created the Japanese version of <a href="https://shop.goop.com/shop?gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8Kmlv5-fWQTRDJNj6nDB_RPgfMfSrybtJZxDJp52BFzVR7ywFiRF7RdEgaAqK7EALw_wcB&amp;utm_campaign=SEM_ALL_NOTARGET_BRAND_CORE_E&amp;utm_medium=sem&amp;utm_source=google&amp;country=USA">Goop</a>. And she alienated the majority of her audience in the process. I'm calling it like I see it: It's a misguided go-to-market product approach. </p>
      <p>The ethos of Kondo's brand doesn't just cater to the high-end, elite, or affluent customer. Her audience is broad and far-reaching. That's precisely the problem with this product launch. By catering to the 1%, she's ruled out the 99% of her fans who really matter. </p>
      <p>As every business owner knows, sometimes you take strong steps forward. And other times, you may take a step back. In the case of Marie Kondo's e-commerce store, this was undoubtedly the latter—but it's not too late. </p>
      <p>Sure, we can condemn Kondo for "selling out" and maybe a bit for selling us a $96 ladle. But, while others might be hating on the hypocrisy of the situation, my criticism falls squarely on poor tactics. Marie, here's some advice on how to grow your lifestyle brand: </p>
      <p>First, don't lose hope. There are still opportunities to build your brand and a path of recovery ahead. </p>
      <p>You built your brand by teaching your acolytes to lose clutter and find joy, and they did it. So, keep teaching them! You have the opportunity to diversify into other points of consumable media, beyond Netflix and print, and continue to develop practical, inspirational content. </p>
      <p>Speaking of content, what happened to the Marie Kondo <a href="https://www.today.com/home/free-iphone-app-debuts-author-life-changing-magic-tidying-t101642">App</a>? It seems to have disappeared from the App store and could really serve you. We've seen the success of subscription-based mental health and wellness apps like 10% Happier, which offers guided meditations and practical teachings. They received <a href="https://designli.co/blog/under-the-hood-how-the-10-happier-app-created-consistent-user-growth-leading-to-3-7-million-in-seed-ii-funding/">$3.7 Million</a> in Seed II funding—which I garner is more than you're making selling $26 bottles of <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/aromatherapy/products/konmari-aromatherapy-paper-crane-apothecary-lucky-stars-abundance-mist">"Abundance Mist."</a></p>
      <p>There's no doubt you're beloved. Your brand is your name. Keep building your presence in thought-leadership and book more speaking engagements, even create a podcast. It's a natural transition to build your brand because people already want to see you, meet you and hear what you have to say. </p>
      <p>Now, if you want to go down the product path, here's what you should do: focus on collaborations, especially with accessible retailers like Target or Macy's. Forget about Goop and look at creating a range of goods that 1) cater to multiple price points and 2) are inviting, beautiful, yet practical for your broad audience. </p>
      <p>Marie, I 100% support you in growing your empire. Just don't continue to contradict your brand ethos in the process. You won our hearts once, and I'm confident that you'll do it again.</p>
