      <p>The Medbury first XI won the national primary school cricket tournament on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The twenty20 round-robin tournament was held at Lincoln University, the New Zealand Cricket High Performance Centre and at the Lincoln Domain.</p>
      <p>Medbury competed against teams from Auckland, Northern Districts, Central Districts, Wellington and Otago.</p>
      <p>They finished the competition with three wins, one loss and one abandoned game with their superior run-rate seeing them win the competition over Havelock North's Hereworth School and Auckland's King's School which both had the same record.</p>
      <p>Coach John Ogston said his team applied themselves well under some scrutiny at the tournament.</p>
      <p>"It was a pleasure for all involved in the Lincoln-based tournament to be able to use the impressive facilities New Zealand Cricket has to offer.</p>
      <p>"The standard of cricket was extremely competitive with the six teams involved having qualified from the their respective district.</p>
      <p>"What pleased me most was seeing our boys respond under pressure and the support they gave their teammates in tightly fought contests."</p>
      <p>Headmaster Ian Macpherson was delighted for the boys, saying they applied the Medbury values of perseverance, loyalty and respect for the opposition throughout the tournament.</p>
