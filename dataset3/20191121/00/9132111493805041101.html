      <p>MP for Ketu South Constituency, Fifi Kwetey, has accused Railways Minister, Joe Ghartey, for merely claiming credit for things he only got the opportunity to build on because of his predecessors; the NDC government.</p>
      <p>He is only ‘building railways in his mouth’, he said, during a public forum on the 2020 Budget Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>According to him, it was the involvement of the John Mahama administration that discovered and accessed the facilities that will provide a historic-first railway line from Tema to Akosombo.</p>
      <p>“Today, when I hear the railway minister saying he’s building railways, I smile because he’s busily building railways in his mouth. We the [NDC] actually accessed the facility that today, is going to give Ghana a railway line from Tema all the way to Akosombo for the first time in our history, which was done dusted and handed over to the New Patriot Party (NPP)”</p>
      <p>“We also rehabilitated the railway line from Takoradi to Kojokrom to Sekondi and handed it over to them [NPP], yet they claim we the [NDC] handed over nothing but a mess to them,” he indicated.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tema-Akosombo Railway line</b>
      </p>
      <p>Minister of Railways Development, Joe Ghartey, earlier this year disclosed that the Tema-Mpakadan railway line project will be completed by June 2020.</p>
      <p>The 99-kilometre railway line stretches from Tema to Akosombo, with an extension to parts of the Volta Region, and will eventually end at Mpakadan.</p>
      <p>The Minister said the completion of the Tema-Mpakadan railway line is significant as it marks the beginning of the Accra-Ougadougou line adding that although the original designated route wherein the railway line was going to pass by had been changed, it will not affect the date of completion.</p>
