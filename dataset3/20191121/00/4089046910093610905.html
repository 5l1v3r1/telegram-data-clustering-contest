      <p><b>CINCINNATI (WXIX) --</b> A North Avondale father in Ohio is under arrest after “tossing” his baby, who was in a car seat, out an apartment door when he became angry during a fight with the baby’s mother, <a href="https://www.fox19.com/2019/11/20/dad-under-arrest-after-tossing-baby-car-seat-out-door/">according to court records</a>.</p>
      <p>The baby fell out of the car seat but sustained no visible injuries, Cincinnati police wrote in a criminal complaint filed in Hamilton County Municipal Court.</p>
      <p>The incident was reported Tuesday in the 1000 block of Dana Avenue.</p>
      <p>Daniel Jones, 33, also is accused of pushing and grabbing a domestic violence victim by the neck and body area, causing physical injuries, an affidavit states.</p>
      <p>Then, when police took him into custody at his residence, they said he was found with a firearm tucked under his waistband and concealed by his shirt, other court records show.</p>
      <p>Jones was booked into the Hamilton County jail Tuesday night on charges of endangering children, domestic violence and carrying concealed weapons.</p>
      <p>Officers asked a judge to issue a temporary protection order against him.</p>
      <p>Jones made a brief court appearance Wednesday.</p>
      <p>His bond was set at $3,000.</p>
      <p>The case goes next to Hamilton County Municipal Court Judge Jackie Ginocchio for a pretrial hearing at 9:30 a.m. Friday.</p>
