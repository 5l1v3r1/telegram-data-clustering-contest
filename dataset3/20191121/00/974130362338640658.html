      <h1>The 1997 Ulster Championship Final Saw The Most Chaotic GAA Post-Match Interview Ever</h1>

      <p>The 1997 Ulster Championship final was a momentous day for Cavan fans. Their county won its first Ulster title in 28 years, beating Derry by a point in Clones.</p>
      <p>Understandably, the scenes following the final whistle were ones of pure elation.</p>
      <p>On the pitch, Cavan manager Martin McHugh was interviewed by Ciaran Mullooly, for RTÉ, in a situation reminiscent of a moshpit.</p>
      <p>'Great for Cavan football. Great for the people of Cavan, for the supporters and for the players. They did it for Cavan today, for the supporters and the people of Cavan', declared McHugh as every man, woman and child in picture attempted to get their hands - and lips - on him.</p>
      <p>The whole interview lasted just 50 seconds before McHugh, Mullooly and the RTÉ cameraman were engulfed by Cavan supporters.</p>
