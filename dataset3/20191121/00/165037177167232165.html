        <b>Matthijs de Ligt, the Juventus defender, spoke to the media after Hollands 5-0 win over Estonia. The player took advantage to disagree with Patrick Kluivert, who assured that De Ligt regretted moving to the Italian side in the summer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I'm happy.<b> I don't regret having signed for Juventus</b>," he was clear. And he said he had not spoken to Kluivert about it. "I didn't speak to him about me, I understand it's a supposition," he pointed out. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/m-de-ligt-309633/">De Ligt</a> understands that the words which Kluivert said have been magnified because he is one of the main men in Dutch football. "<b>I guess the fact it comes from someone like Kluivert </b>makes it more credible, but I didn't say anything to him about me," he repeated. </p>
      <p>The footballer always knew that it was not going to be easy for him. <b>"I knew that, with what was paid for me</b>, I would be looked at very closely and it all deteriorated after that match against Napoli," the former Ajax man said. </p>
      <p>De Ligt is still in a period of adaptation and is hoping to continue improving day after day: "<b>I am making an additional effort.</b> I have the fondness of my teammates and fans.<b> I'm happy with how everything's going</b>. </p>

      <p><b>The defender is happy to share a dressing room </b>with footballing legends in Turin. "Before coming to the club as an Ajax kid you think: <b>Ronaldo, Buffon, Bonucci, Chiellini</b>... but if you play with them for two months, all of that disappears. <b>They are only teammates..</b>. and very good ones," he concluded. </p>
