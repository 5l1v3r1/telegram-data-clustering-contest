      <p>The National Democratic Congress (NDC), has disclosed that the party will not announce a running mate for the party’s flagbearer until 2020.</p>
      <p>National Chairman for the party, Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo, speaking on Asempa FM on Wednesday, disclosed that the party would only announce a running mate for the flagbearer during the election year.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t elect running mates outside election years; they are always elected during the election year so we will announce ours in 2020. I don’t see us lagging behind,” he said.</p>
      <p>Quizzed if he has in mind any bigwigs of the party that he deems is fit to fill the vacant post, Mr Ofosu-Ampofo declined the invitation to throw out names, saying he was “a kingmaker” and as such had no favourite in the party.</p>
      <p>“I am not the one who chooses the running mate. I am a kingmaker so I hardly hear anything as far as choosing a person as the running mate is concerned,” he added.</p>
