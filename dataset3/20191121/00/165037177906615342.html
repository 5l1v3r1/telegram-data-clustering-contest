        <b>Jose Mourinho took time to pay a warm tribute to Mauricio Pochettino at the start of his first news conference as Tottenham head coach.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b> will always be welcome at <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/team/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>, according to his successor <b>Jose Mourinho.</b></p>
      <p>Pochettino was <b>sacked after five-and-a-half years</b> at the helm on Tuesday, with last season's Champions League finalists moving quickly to appoint former <b>Chelsea</b>, <b>Real Madrid</b> and <b>Manchester United</b> boss Mourinho as head coach.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old faced his first news conference in charge of Spurs on Thursday and began by <b>speaking warmly of Pochettino</b>, who <b>remains widely revered by the club's fanbase</b> despite a dismal start to the current campaign that leaves them languishing 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been smiling for two days [but] first of all I do it with<b> a bit of sadness</b> [because] I have to speak about Mauricio," Mourinho said.</p>
      <p>"I have to <b>congratulate him on the incredible job he did</b>. I share with you what we shared inside. This club will always be his home; this training ground is his training ground. <b>He is always welcome here."</b></p>
      <p>"Tomorrow is another day. <b>He will find happiness soon. He will give everything like he did at this club</b>. He will leave with sadness, with the feeling that he did great work. It is what everyone at the club felt."</p>

      <p>A turbulent week has meant a <b>quick turnaround for Mourinho</b>, who will lead Spurs for the first time at West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He has been out of management for almost a year after being sacked by Manchester United last December but <b>insists he is ready for the challenge.</b></p>
      <p>"I had a feeling I was going to get a club mid-season," he said. "<b>I knew I would be in a situation where I would get only one or two days before my first game. </b>I cannot come here and think it is about myself. It is about the players and going from a base of stability."</p>
      <p>"I thought about it during these months because I thought I might get a job mid-season and I might have a game two days later. We have our own ways but <b>they were in the hands of a good manager and coaching staff</b> here."</p>
      <p>Club record signing <b>Tanguy Ndombele</b> and centre-back <b>Jan Vertonghen</b> face fitness tests on respective groin and hamstring complaints, while Mourinho will be without winger <b>Erik Lamela</b> (hamstring) and goalkeeping duo <b>Michel Vorm</b> (calf) and <b>Hugo Lloris</b> (elbow) at London Stadium.</p>
