        <b>A new mess could be brewing around Neymar. The Brazilian striker wrote an enigmatic message on his social media in what sounded like a response to the discomfort his manager had declared hours earlier about his trip to watch the Davis Cup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Let's get the situation straight. The Paris Saint-Germain manager had made it clear on Thursday that he didn't like that Neymar travelled last Tuesday to Madrid to watch the Davis Cup, a few days before his scheduled return after more than a month out due to injury.</p>
      <p>"As a coach, do I like that trip? No. <b>Is it time to lose your head?</b> No," the German manager said at the pre-match press conference before the match against on Lille on Friday.</p>
      <p>"What can I do?<b> I am not his dad or the police</b>. I am his manager. And on Wednesday he trained well", he said.</p>
