      <h1>Xhaka's 'mindset is better' after spat with fans, says Arsenal's Emery</h1>

        <b>Arsenal boss Unai Emery said Thursday that Granit Xhaka's "mindset is better" after he missed four matches following his public run-in with the club's fans.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Switzerland international was <b>stripped of the club captaincy</b> after swearing and throwing the captain's armband to the ground in reaction to Gunners fans booing him as he was substituted against Crystal Palace late last month.</p>
      <p>Xhaka, 27, blamed death threats to his family for his furious response, saying he had reached "<b>boiling point</b>", but Emery said he was training well after playing in both of his country's Euro 2020 qualifiers in the past week.</p>
      <p>"He is coming back better in his mind, his <b>mindset is better</b> to help us and to be closer to playing when we need him," said Emery ahead of his side's home match with Southampton on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to him this morning and we had a very good conversation. He trained very well before the international break and he <b>trained very well this morning."</b></p>

      <p>Emery gave no guarantee that <b>Xhaka would feature against the Saints</b>.</p>
      <p>"We are going to decide tomorrow but I want to do that comeback, <b>give him confidence and make him comfortable</b>," he said. "And when we can connect with our supporters with a good moment and a good performance and being strong with them."</p>
      <p>Arsenal, without a win in four Premier League matches, are sixth in the table, eight points behind the top four, but Emery was positive they could narrow the gap.</p>
      <p>"Last year we had some experience in reducing the gap against important teams and now that's our objective," said the Spaniard.</p>
      <p>"We know it won't take a short time but that's our goal and our challenge now is to reduce the distance, little by little, and starting on Saturday and <b>that match is very important</b>."</p>
