        <b>UEFA confirmed the opening of an investigation over the racist incidents which occurred on 15th November between Romania and Sweden. It was close to being suspended by the Italian referee Daniele Orsato.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The match was interrupted on two occasions by the referee</b>, first because firecrackers were thrown and flares were set off and then after racist abuse from the crowd. The Swede, Alexsander Isak, who plays for Real Sociedad, <b>was the victim of racist abuse from the home crowd</b> when he came on in the second half. </p>
      <p>The referee then threatened to suspend the game and the PA system at the Arena Nacional in Bucharest called for an end to the racism.<b> The match then continued with further incidents</b> and Sweden won 0-2. </p>
