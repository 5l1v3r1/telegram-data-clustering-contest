      <h1>Alexi McCammond, Axios reporter who called out Charles Barkley, under</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/staff/jessica-chasmar/" target="_blank">Jessica Chasmar</a></address>
      <p>The Axios reporter who accused <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/nba/">NBA</a> legend Charles Barkley of making a threatening joke toward her apologized for her own past comments on Wednesday after Twitter sleuths dug up old tweets of her making fun of Asian people.</p>
      <p>Reporter <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexi-mccammond/">Alexi McCammond</a> made <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/nov/20/charles-barkley-accused-of-threatening-joke-to-fem/">headlines</a> this week after she fired off a series of tweets accusing Mr. Barkley of saying, “I don’t hit women, but if I did I would hit you,” during an off-the-record conversation in Atlanta on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“This is not OK,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexi-mccammond/">Ms. McCammond</a> wrote, explaining that she broke her off-the-record agreement with Mr. Barkley because she felt the need to shine a light on domestic abuse.</p>
      <p>Mr. Barkley later apologized for his poor attempt at humor.</p>
      <p>“My comment was inappropriate and unacceptable,” the TNT sports analyst said in a statement Wednesday. “It was an attempted joke that wasn’t funny at all. There’s no excuse for it and I apologize.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexi-mccammond/">Ms. McCammond</a> received her own criticism for calling out Mr. Barkley’s joke, prompting users to examine her past tweets. Screenshots showed her mocking “Asian eyes” and calling her then-teaching assistant a “stupid Asian.”</p>
      <p>“Today I was reminded of some past insensitive tweets, and I am deeply sorry to anyone I offended,” <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexi-mccammond/">Ms. McCammond</a> tweeted Wednesday evening. “I have since deleted those tweets as they do not reflect my views or who I am today.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/alexi-mccammond/">Ms. McCammond</a> said the backlash has led to racist harassment and threats.</p>

        <p>“In the past 24 hours I’ve been called a [racial slur] too many times to count,” she wrote. “I’ve been told to go kill myself; told that I should die because everyone hates me; and threatened by countless men who say they’d love to hit me. If you think this is warranted, you’re part of the problem.”</p>
