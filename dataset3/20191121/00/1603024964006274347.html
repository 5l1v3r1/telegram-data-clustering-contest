      <p>PPFAS mutual fund, which started operations six-and-half years ago, crossed assets under management (AUM) of over Rs 2,700 crore, its Chairman and CEO Neil Parag Parikh said on November 21.</p>
      <p>Parikh said the flagship long-term equity fund scheme has an AUM of Rs 2,300 crore, and invests in both domestic and foreign equities.</p>
      <p>"We have two more MF schemes -- liquid and tax saver funds. We want to stick to these three schemes for the moment," he told reporters here.</p>
      <p>He said the long-term equity fund scheme invests 35 per cent of assets in foreign equities like Facebook, Google and Amazon, among others. "Foreign equities provide protection from country-specific risks," Parikh said.</p>
      <p>He said West Bengal is among its top 10 markets. "We have mobilised more than Rs 50 crore from the region and it is an important market for us."<a href="https://transactmoneycontrol.page.link/?link=https://transact.moneycontrol.com/ux/&amp;apn=com.nw18.android.fundscontrol&amp;ofl=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nw18.android.fundscontrol&amp;isi=1310527238&amp;ibi=com.nw18.ios.fundscontrol&amp;utm_source=Articles&amp;utm_campaign=MF_PF_Articles&amp;efr=1">Not sure which mutual funds to buy?
