      <p>Adding just one extra item to your Christmas list for a child in need will help the Salvation Army make a difference to the lives of those less fortunate.</p>
      <p>That is the message coming from Newcastle Permanent which is asking residents across the Hunter to chip in and support families doing it tough.</p>
      <p>Donations for The Salvation Army's annual Christmas Appeal can be made at any of Newcastle Permanent's branches or head office and this year there is a focus on also including gifts for teenagers as well as small children.</p>
