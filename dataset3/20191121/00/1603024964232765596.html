      <p>The price of tomato in Pakistan's largest city Karachi on Tuesday skyrocketed to a record high of Rs 400 per kilogram due to a range of factors, including import restriction, according to a media report.</p>
      <p>The Pakistan government last week issued a permit for importing 4,500 tonnes of tomatoes from Iran, but its arrival did not pick up pace in the market, resulting in a persistent hike in the rates due to rising demand, Dawn News reported.</p>
      <p>Of the 4,500 tonnes, only 989 tonnes arrived in Pakistan, a trader was quoted as saying by the report.</p>
      <p>People in Karachi got a shock since last week when the price of tomato rose from Rs 300 per kg to Rs 400 per kg on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The high price of the fruit is to be blamed to the shortage of tomato crops this year.</p>
      <p>"Right now tomatoes from Iran and Swat are selling in Karachi and there is a shortage which has led to the price boom," a trader said.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the official retail rate of tomato was Rs 117 per kg.</p>
      <p>The federal government is to be blamed for the price hike as it has restricted import to a few people instead of allowing a free import by any trader, the report said. As a result, the limited quantities were already booked and sold at the Taftan border, it said.</p>
      <p>Previously open imports had somewhat kept the tomato prices stable, Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market president Haji Shahjehan said.</p>
      <p>Various factors have led to reduction in the supply of tomatoes, including ill-timed government policies and heavy rains which affected its production, an earlier report said.</p>
