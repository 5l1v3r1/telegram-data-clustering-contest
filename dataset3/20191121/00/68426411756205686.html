      <p>The company said it became aware of the incident this week and started an analysis of all other transaction activity across all of its bank accounts and its internal systems and controls, including its computer networks. It has also hired a third-party IT services provider to do an independent investigation of the company's systems "and is working with its auditors and bank to ensure that appropriate steps have been taken to mitigate the chance of any future occurrences of similar cyberattacks." The company said that "at this time," it doesn't believe that its systems were breached or that any personal information of its customers is at risk.</p>
      <p>The company said it hasn't recovered any of the approximately $2.1-million wired to the fraudulent third-party account and doesn't expect this incident to "have a material impact on its business going forward or otherwise impact its near-term liquidity requirements or its ongoing operations."</p>

The company said the suspension is related to “surface instability issues caused by localized artisanal mining.” The company said it expects to resume blasting and full mining activities before year-end and that mining at the open-pit remains unaffected.</p>
      <p>The company reaffirmed its fourth-quarter consolidated guidance of 32,000 to 35,000 ounces of gold production at an all-in sustaining cost of US$950 to US$980 per gold ounce sold. "La Libertad is, however, now expecting gold production towards the lower end of its guidance range," the company stated.</p>

It said the decision is based on an updated review of the reserves and resources, “which are now exhausted.” Mining operations will cease on Nov. 30, the company said, and milling operations will continue for approximately one week until the ore stockpile has been processed and the mill cleaned of concentrates.</p>
      <p>The company said suspension costs are estimated to be approximately $3.5-million to $4-million, primarily in the fourth quarter, including final severance payments for all employees.</p>
      <p>“El Cubo was a good mine for us but our exploration programs in recent years failed to replace reserves and find new resources," said CEO Bradford Cooke. "We reduced the plant throughput this year in order to explore for new reserves but without success. As forecasted, grades and throughput have been declining all year, which resulted in declining economics of the mine in recent months.”</p>
