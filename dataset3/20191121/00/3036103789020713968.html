      <h1>Amazon to launch game streaming service in 2020 – Report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Amazon plans to announce its video game streaming service in 2020, reports <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/"><b>CNet</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon has also begun a recruitment drive for a new service within its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which is reportedly Amazon’s video game streaming product.</p>
      <p>“We believe the evolution that began with arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and e-sports of today, will continue to a future where everyone is a gamer and every gamer can create, compete, collaborate and connect with others at massive scales,” said one Amazon job posting.</p>
      <p>Another job posting claims that Amazon is looking to “drive innovative use cases like machine vision and game streaming”.</p>
      <h3>Competition for Google</h3>
      <p>Amazon’s streaming service will be competition for other game streaming platforms such as <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/328037-the-new-games-coming-to-google-stadia.html"><b>Google Stadia</b></a> and the upcoming <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/327769-microsofts-big-plans-for-xcloud-game-streaming.html"><b>Microsoft xCloud</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Google Stadia launched on 19 November and offers a variety of popular games on its platform, including Final Fantasy XV, Red Dead Redemption 2, Rage 2, and Wolfenstein: Youngblood.</p>
      <p>Stadia is currently available in 14 countries including the US, Canada, and the UK.</p>
      <p>Microsoft’s xCloud will be integrated with Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service, allowing gamers to stream games from a library to a range of devices, including Android-based smartphones and tablets.</p>
      <p>Games available on the beta test for xCloud include Devil May Cry 5, Tekken 7, Forza Horizon 4, Crackdown 3, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider.</p>
