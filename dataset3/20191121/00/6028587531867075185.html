      <p><a href="https://www.anaplan.com/"><b>Anaplan</b></a> (PLAN) this morning delivered a strong earnings report for the October quarter, with revenue rising 44% to $89.4 million, 3.5% above the consensus estimate. Billings of $114.3 million advanced 59%, a sharp acceleration from growth of 46% in the previous quarter. After jumping as much as 13% on the news, the stock finished today’s session with a gain of 8%.In FQ3, Anaplan, a provider of cloud-based enterprise planning software, saw its subscription revenue rise 47% to $79.7 million, while professional services revenue of $9.7 million was up 27%. Gross margin of 76% rose nearly 340 basis points year over year. The dollar-based net expansion rate ticked up to 123% from 121% in FQ2.</p>
      <p>Remaining performance obligations (RPO) of $590 million advanced 55%, barely decelerating from the FQ2 growth rate of 56%.</p>
      <p>Anaplan ended FQ3 with more than 1,300 customers, up 30% from the year-ago level. There are now 324 accounts with annual recurring revenue (ARR) over $250,000, a gain of 42% year over year. The number of customers with ARR greater than $1 million rose 57%. </p>
      <p>Anaplan’s largest customers keep coming back to expand and extend deployments. The 25 largest customers have an average ARR of more than $3.5 million, up 40% year over year. The average ARR for the top 10 customers stands at $5.3 million.</p>
      <p>About 60% of Anaplan’s business remains tied to finance-based planning, with the remaining 40% related to other use cases—mainly sales planning and supply chain planning. Workforce planning is a new growth driver for the company.</p>
      <p>In FQ3, Anaplan had a record quarter for 7-figure expansion deals. On the earnings call, Anaplan CEO Frank Calderoni said customer expansions on the company’s platform are taking place faster and now involve larger deployments. </p>
      <p>Calderoni pointed out that spreadsheets have been around for 40 years, but haven’t really evolved much during that time. Instead of working in siloed environments with multiple sets of data in stagnant spreadsheets, employees today want to use a connected solution that brings together planning across finance, sales, the supply chain and the workforce.</p>
      <p>One of Anaplan’s largest deals in FQ3 was a 7-figure expansion with a global consumer packaged goods company. The customer, with 60 subsidiaries and more than $50 billion in annual revenue, is standardizing on Anaplan for all of its planning endeavors. In another 7-figure expansion deal, a manufacturing customer that had deployed Anaplan for finance-based planning last year came back to implement a company-wide connected planning initiative across 17 departments.</p>
      <p>For FQ4, Anaplan expects revenue of $96.5 million to $97.5 million, above the consensus estimate of $95.3 million. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be negative 14% to negative 15%.</p>
      <p>For FY’20 (ending January), the company’s latest revenue guidance range of $346 million to $347 million (revised upward from $339 million to $343 million previously) represents 44% growth at the midpoint, above the consensus growth rate of 42.2%. Anaplan expects FY’20 adjusted operating margin to be negative 17% to negative 18%, a slight improvement from the previous guide of negative 19.5% to negative 20.5%.</p>
      <p>On the FQ3 call, Anaplan management offered a first look into FY’21. Initial revenue guidance of $455 million to $460 million (growth of 31% to 33%) compares favorably to the consensus estimate of $449.4 million (growth of 31.4%). Given Anaplan’s current business momentum, guidance for next year looks conservative.</p>
      <p>Recently trading around $53, Anaplan shares have advanced 211% since the company’s IPO in October 2018 at $17. While the stock is down from the post-IPO high of $60.36 reached in late July, it has rebounded 26% from last month’s low of $41.87.</p>
      <p>Using the enterprise value, Anaplan shares trade at 19.2 times the new FY’20 revenue guidance midpoint. On the FY’21 guidance midpoint, the forward multiple is a more reasonable 14.5.</p>
      <p>Coatue Management is one big investor that should be happy with today’s FQ3 results, as the tech-focused hedge fund is the #1 holder of Anaplan, with 12.8 million shares. In Q3, Whale Rock Capital Management was the #1 buyer, opening a new position of 3.84 million shares. Whale Rock, run by former Fidelity portfolio manager Alex Sacerdote, is now the #6 holder of Anaplan. Another notable buyer in Q3, Tiger Global Management, initiated a position of 1.2 million shares.</p>
