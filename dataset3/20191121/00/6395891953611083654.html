      <p><b>MARSHFIELD, Mass.</b> - Trash collection drivers working for Republic Service in Marshfield called off their strike and quit their jobs Wednesday. </p>
      <p>At least two dozen workers walked off the job on August 29, demanding the company negotiate their first contract with Teamsters Local 25. </p>
      <p>After 84 days, they decided they no longer wanted to work for Republic even if they were able to reach an agreement on a contract. </p>
      <p>Local 25 has vowed to find the workers jobs in Teamsters-covered industries.</p>
      <p>"Local 25 will continue to work with locals to build a long-term, national strategic network to fight the white-collar criminals who run Republic," Teamsters Local 25 President Sean O'Brien said in a statement. "I want to thank the members of Teamsters Local 25, Joint Council 10 and all of the Teamsters and union supporters everywhere for standing with these brave workers. This is just one battle in a long war that we will win."</p>
      <p>Republic has out-of-state replacement workers taking care of contracted trash services in Marshfield, Abington and Rockland. </p>
      <p>Boston 25 News has reached out to Republic for comment. </p>
