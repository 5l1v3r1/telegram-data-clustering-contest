      <h1>City has hopped on to rental bikes with gusto</h1>

      <p><i>Bad roads, messy traffic made us bike rental capital of the world<br/></i><br/>Vignesh SK used to hitch-hike to get to college daily. These days, though, he prefers to hop on to a rental bike. On any give day, the number of rental bikes parked on college campuses, is a pointer to the fact that this phenomenon has really caught on in the city. <br/><br/>According to a Global Scooter Sharing Market Report 2019 by Unu, Bengaluru has the highest availability of rental bikes (around 15,000 bikes) and so the city has earned a new sobriquet-the global bike rental capital. Aggregators say that the reason for quick popularity of rental services in the city is the heavy traffic, which pushes the working population to move to public transport and rental bikes for last mile connectivity, parking issues, and the non-willingness for the working population, who have migrated from other cities, to buy their own vehicle too early. <br/><br/>Nishchay AG -Director - Supply Chain at Bounce, explains, “Bengalureans are very curious and good at adopting new technologies and innovations. The city folk love technologies that add value to their lives as due to rapid urbanisation, the roads are always congested. Anything that enables people to move faster is a hit. Bengaluru has always been the innovation capital for new-age solutions and will continue to be the capital of any innovation that saves money and time.” <br/><br/>He says that 40% of Bounce rides end at Metro stations. <br/><br/>Vinay Sreenivasa, co-founder of Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike that supports public transport, says,”Rental bikes are a hit because of multiple things - one, the bus fleet size is not enough and bus rides are expensive. Two, there is no parking charge here for two-wheelers or cars.” He struck a cautious note, however, saying that the state encourages start-ups in the name of business and development, but some of it may be harmful to the city. <br/><br/>RK Misra, co-founder of Yulu Bikes that provide last mile connectivity from Metro stations and rental bikes for other commutes, says, “Bengaluru is a commuters’ nightmare given extreme congestion and very poor Public infrastructure. With limited Metro availability, which doesn’t connect to any of the commute destinations of ORR, Whitefield, Electronics City, people are forced to use their personal vehicles.” <br/><br/><br/>He says that first and last mile connectivity is a big challenge for the city, given the poor density of public transport. As an example he says people working in EGL come to Indiranagar Metro but have no way to reach EGL. “They use Yulu extensively. Finally the city has a very young population of tech savvy professionals who have made city their home. These young professionals (specially girls) find comfort, safety and freedom of movement with Public Bike Sharing systems. They don’t have to haggle with auto drivers and feel safer on their own.” <br/><br/>Srinivas Alavilli, co-founder of Citizens for Bengaluru, also says lack of public transport has made this service a hit. ” <br/><br/><br/>On the flip side, there have been numerous complaints over the usage of rental bikes. One of the common complaint is the way these bikes are parked after the commute. It is common to see many of these bikes are parked on flyovers or roads thereby obstructing traffic. The bike rental companies have said that they are working on this issue.</p>
