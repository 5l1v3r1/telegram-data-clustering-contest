      <p>Pastor <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/enoch-adeboye/"><u>Enoch Adeboye</u></a></b>, General overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God has donated the sum of N10 million to the <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/uch/"><u><b>University College Hospital (UCH)</b></u></a> Ibadan, Oyo state.</p>
      <p>Naija News learnt that the N10 million was used to purchase one hemodialysis machine for the hospital.</p>
      <p>The machine helps to filter a patient’s blood to remove excess water and waste products.</p>
      <p>The pastor shared a post on his Instagram page, explaining that God had charged him to donate the hemodialysis machine to the school hospital, adding that he has left his home after his morning devotion to commission the machine.</p>
      <p>Adeboye further noted that the holy spirit has directed him to donate two more as the university’s hospital needed more help.</p>
