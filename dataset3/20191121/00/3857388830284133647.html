      </p>
      <p>Nigeria’s former Attorney-general and Justice Minister Mohammed Adoke has been arrested in Dubai over fraud and corruption allegations, the government confirms.</p>
      <p>Mr. Adoke, who travelled to Dubai for medical attention, was arrested by International Police (Interpol) for alleged involvement in oil scams, fraud and money laundering.</p>
      <p>Mr. Adoke’s lawyer filed an application for the letter of attestation from Nigeria’s Ministry of Justice for Interpol to release him. However, the Nigerian government instead forwarded to Interpol charges against the former minister.</p>
      <p>Prof. Itse Sagay, the chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee against Corruption re-ported that the arrest is the latest success in the fight against corruption under the federal government.</p>
      <p>The charges forwarded to the international police include conspiracy and money laundering on Malabu Oil Block; conflict of interest on Malabu Oil Block; and involvement in the $9.6 bil-lion judgment award against Nigeria by Process and Industrial Developments (P&amp;ID).</p>

      <p>Nigeria’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had earlier obtained a warrant is-sued by a Federal Capital Territory High Court in Abuja.</p>
