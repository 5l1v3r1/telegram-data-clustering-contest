      <p><b>the <a href="https://www.mbusa.com/en/home?gclid=Cj0KCQiAiNnuBRD3ARIsAM8KmlvV2AmjWIjrpcfd3IfQPH-j7-yNDocg4kS_p7r-fi1XEgm_LdlAOukaAkoYEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">mercedes-benz</a> GLS 600 4MATIC is a <i>‘unique combination of comfort, technology and luxury’</i> states martin hulder, director of product management mercedes-maybach. </b>the four-seater SUV is fully electronically controlled, allowing users to customize and control their climatized massage seats (finished in fine nappa leather), panoramic sliding/tilting sunroof, roller sun blinds and center console. upon special request, mercedes-benz also provides trim upgrades on the center console to become folding tables — or even a refrigerator with space for champagne bottles. with the e-active body control settings available, the car provides the best suspension in its class.</p>

      <p><b>as a special, maybach-specific feature, two-tone paintwork is planned in eight different, elegant color combinations.</b> the vehicle also comes with either 22 or 23-inch wheels developed exclusively for this model, with the 23-inch version echoing the pinstripe theme. out front, the classic erected chrome mercedes-benz can be seen above the maybach logo, while in rear, the two logos are seen side by side.</p>

      <p><b>below the radiator grille, the front apron has a wide air inlet that suggests the power of the V8 engine with a finely woven grille in high-grade chrome</b>. another eye-catching feature is the electrically extending running boards that illuminate in the dark; they make accessing and leaving the high seating position convenient and safe.</p>
