      <p>The opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) on Thursday failed to show up at the National Peace Council dialogue series on political vigilantism at Peduase in the Eastern Region.</p>
      <p>The meeting, which is the final in the series, was meant to peruse the draft roadmap.</p>
      <p>It is expected to be followed the political parties appending their signatures for implementation.</p>
      <p>While the New Patriotic Party (NPP) was represented by its Director of Communications, Yaw Buaben Asamoa, and other senior members, the largest opposition party was conspicuously missing in action.</p>
      <p>Seats designated for them were empty.</p>
      <p>Chairman of Council Most Rev. Professor Emmanuel Asante, however, indicated that irrespective of NDC’s inability to make an appearance, he expects them to sign the final draft later.</p>
      <p>“The National Peace Council will closely work with the political parties and the responsible institutions to realise the full implementation of the recommendations of the roadmap and the code of conduct.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, the NDC is unable to join us this morning but they have the documents in their hands and are fully aware that this document is being discussed. The outcome will be conveyed to them.”</p>
