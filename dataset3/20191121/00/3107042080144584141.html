      <h1>Rare game in Queenstown for Otago</h1>

      <p>Queenstowners will be treated to a rare sight today - domestic cricket.</p>
      <p>Otago had a training camp in the resort town earlier this year but the Volts have not played at the Queenstown Events Centre in more than three years.</p>
      <p>It will break the drought today when it hosts Wellington in a one-dayer.</p>
      <p>The picturesque venue was once one of the jewels in crown. It hosted regular internationals and domestic matches.</p>
      <p>But it fell out of vogue. It was seen as an expensive venue to stage domestic games and New Zealand Cricket stopped scheduling international matches there after a couple of rained out games and some poor attendance.</p>
      <p>The venue has had a $640,000 upgrade to sort out the drainage issues and it hosted nine under-19 World Cup games last year.</p>
      <p>It seemed to be positioning itself as a venue which could stage international fixtures again but is not hosting any games this season.</p>
      <p>Otago had hoped to play there more this season but it was unable to because of scheduling conflicts, Otago Cricket Association chief executive Mike Coggan said.</p>
      <p>''We went to them with a date but it was unavailable because there was football booked on it,'' Coggan said.</p>
      <p>''But certainly for the future were are working with them for potentially more opportunities there.''</p>
      <p>However, Otago can attract bigger crowds for twenty20 matches in Alexandra, so Molyneux Park is the preferred venue in Central Otago for that format.</p>
      <p>The most recent one-day international in Queenstown was in 2014. That match was made memorable by Black Caps batsman Corey Anderson. He thrashed a 36-ball century.</p>
