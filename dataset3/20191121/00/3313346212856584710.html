      <p><i>Pokemon Sword</i> and <i>Pokemon Shield</i> have sold over 6 million units worldwide in one week, becoming the fastest-selling Switch game to date.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191121005357/en/">press release from Nintendo of America</a>, that figure accounts for both physical and digital sales, and means the latest entry in the franchise has <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/331283/Pokemon_Lets_Go_has_sold_over_3_million_units_worldwide.php">doubled the first-week sales of <i>Pokemon Let's Go</i></a>, which arrived on the Switch last year.</p>
      <p>It also means <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> have surpassed the Switch launch sales record set by <i>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</i>, which <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/333375/Smash_Bros_Ultimate_worldwide_sales_topped_5M_in_first_week.php">sold 5 million copies globally</a> during its first week on shelves.</p>
      <p>Breaking those sales down by region, Nintendo revealed the game has sold over 2 million units in the U.S. alone.
