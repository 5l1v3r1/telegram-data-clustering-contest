      <h1>Fate of Male Birth Control Injection Now in Government’s Hands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Kristin Houser</a></address>
      <p>Women have a number of <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control">options</a> for contraception, from pills to implants to injections.</p>
      <p>But aside from condoms, men have just one: sterilization, which isn’t always ideal given that it involves surgery and can be difficult to reverse.</p>
      <p>That could soon change, though, as researchers in India have completed testing on a male birth control injection — and the only thing now standing in its way is regulatory approval.</p>
      <p>“The trials are over, including extended, phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side-effects,” researcher RS Sharma, a senior scientist with the Indian Council of Medical Research, <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-closer-to-world-s-first-male-contraceptive-injection/story-o3lTFLnCkKHpuEDNNqrEnO.html">told <i>The Hindustan Times</i></a>. “The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive.”</p>
      <p>The contraceptive is a polymer that a medical professional injects into a patient’s vas deferens under local anesthesia.</p>
      <p>That’s the same tube that gets snipped during a <a href="https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/vasectomy">vasectomy</a>, but blocking it with a polymer achieves the same goal — preventing sperm from exiting the testicles — without requiring a patient to undergo surgery. What’s more, the new <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/birth-control-drug-men-women">contraceptive</a> loses its potency after 13 years, so it’s not as permanent as a vasectomy.</p>
      <p>Now that all the research and development is complete, the fate of the male birth control injection is in the hands of India’s regulators.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first in the world from India so we have to be extra careful about approval,” VG Somani, India’s drug controller general, told <i>The Hindustan Times</i>, adding that he thinks it will “take about six to seven months for all the approvals to be granted before the product can be manufactured.”</p>
