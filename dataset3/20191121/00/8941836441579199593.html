      <p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) - New Mexico is considering whether to extend its medical cannabis program to dogs with epilepsy and people with attention deficit disorder.</p>
      <p>Petitions for new qualifying medical conditions have been filed with the Medical Cannabis Advisory Board at its upcoming meeting in December. The Department of Health withheld the names of petition sponsors.</p>
      <p>One petition cites recent studies in veterinary medicine to suggest authorization of cannabis for animals coping with seizures. Cannabidiol derived from hemp or marijuana already is widely marketed for pets.</p>
      <p>Another petition would allow marijuana for attention deficit-hyperactivity, anxiety disorder and Tourette’s syndrome.</p>
