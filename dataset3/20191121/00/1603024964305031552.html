      <p>Alibaba will pay its investment banking syndicate up to $32.3 million (Â£25.00 million) for leading its Hong Kong listing which will raise up to $12.9 billion, according to documents filed with U.S. securities regulators.</p>
      <p>The Chinese commerce e-commerce giant employed two co-sponsors, China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and Credit Suisse , to head the deal which has been carried out over the past week.</p>
      <p>The two lead banks were joined by Citigroup Inc , JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley as joint global co-ordinators while HSBC and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) were appointed as junior book runners.</p>
      <p>An additional supplementary prospectus lodged with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed Alibaba would pay the banks up to $32.3 million, if a so-called overallotment of a further 75 million shares is issued which bankers think will occur.</p>
      <p>If the over-allotment does not occur, then the investment banking fees paid will be $28.1 million.</p>
