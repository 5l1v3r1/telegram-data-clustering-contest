      <p>The kid from Slovenia was 12-1 the last time we wrote about him. Now, after yet another triple-double, he is down to 9-1.The sportsbooks in the legalized U.S. sports gambling market reacted quickly to Luka Doncic’s seventh triple-double of the season – 35 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in the Dallas Mavericks’ 48-point victory over the Golden State Warriors – lowering his odds from 12-1 (which <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrissheridan/2019/11/19/luka-doncics-mvp-odds-drop-to-12-1-after-triple-double-no-6/">we reported on two days ago</a>).</p>
      <p>The overnight crew on ESPN was already calling it a four-man race for MVP following Wednesday night’s huge slate of games, with Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden, LeBron James and Doncic the fearsome foursome.</p>
      <p>And that makes sense unless Kawhi Leonard goes bonkers over the remainder of the season and his 11 missed games are not held against him. He had 17 points in 38 minutes in a victory over the Boston Celtics that dropped them into a tie with the Milwaukee Bucks for first-place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
      <p>But Doncic is becoming a phenomenon, a triple-double machine whose likes have not been seen since Russell Westbrook was tearing it up for the Oklahoma City Thunder a few years ago.</p>

      <p>Doncic scored 33 of his 35 points in the first half. He was 10 for 11 from the floor, making 6 of 7 3-pointers, and hit 7 of 8 free throws.</p>
      <p>The second-year player from Slovenia was coming off a 40-point triple-double Monday. He has an NBA-best seven triple-doubles in 14 games.</p>
      <p>"I see (the stats), but I don't know what to say," Doncic said. "It's great to read about. I just enjoy the basketball."</p>

      <p>Doncic is now second in the NBA in assists, averaging 9.4. LeBron James, who <a href="https://bertie.forbes.com/#/compose?id=5dd3f23d23bb110006a8fb6b">is +650 at DraftKings</a> and +500 at Fan Duel, leads the NBA with 11.1 assists per game.</p>
      <p>A day earlier, even the Mavericks coach couldn’t ignore the 20-year-old phenom’s production when asked about MVP consideration. “I don’t get into awards stuff,” Carlisle said before a brief pause. “But yes.”</p>
      <p>He’s now the only player in league history to record a 35-point triple-double in under 30 minutes and the youngest player with consecutive 35-point triple-doubles. In seven straight games, Doncic has scored at least 10 points in the first quarter.</p>
      <p>In the last 30 seasons, just three 21-year-old players — Doncic’s age at the end of this season — have finished top-five in MVP voting: Tim Duncan (1997-98), James (2005-06) and Kevin Durant (2009-10).</p>
      <p>“Obviously there’s a lot of hype around him, a lot of praise around him that he’s lived up to,” Jalen Brunson said. “Off the court, he’s just another dude.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what to say,”added teammate Tim Hardaway. “It’s amazing. If he kept playing today, he probably would’ve had 50.”</p>
