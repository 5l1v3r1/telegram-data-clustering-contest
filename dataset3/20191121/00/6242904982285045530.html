        <b>Ghanaian youngster Jeremie Frimpong has been tipped to reach a valuation of £20million within the next two years if he continues showing his fine form.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to Football Insider, a source close to Celtic has revealed that the club’s coaching staff have been seriously impressed by the former Manchester City man since his arrival in the summer.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the report also claims they believe the full-back could be “worth £20million in two years if he keeps his feet on the ground.”</p>
      <p>Frimpong has certainly hit the ground running at Celtic, and he has been incredibly impressive in his five appearances for the club so far.</p>
      <p>While it appears too early to stick such a price tag on the 18-year-old, the raw potential he possesses is there for all to see.</p>
      <p>And if he remains as level-headed as he appears to currently be, then there is no reason why he can’t reach the top level and become a great player for Celtic.</p>
