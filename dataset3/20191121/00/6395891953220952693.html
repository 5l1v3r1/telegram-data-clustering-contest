      <p><b>BOSTON</b> - First responders in Massachusetts are one step closer to being able to treat and transport injured police dogs to veterinary hospitals. </p>
      <p>"Nero's bill," named for the K9 partner of fallen Yarmouth Police Sergeant Sean Gannon, received a favorable recommendation from the Legislature's Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee, Representative Will Crocker said on Wednesday.  </p>
      <p>Gannon was shot and killed while serving an arrest warrant in Marstons Mills on April 12, 2018.</p>
      <p>Nero was also shot, but because of current state law, EMTs weren't able to treat or transport him. </p>
      <p>A retired K9 officer eventually arrived to help Nero, who survived.</p>
      <p>The legislation sponsored by Crocker and Senator Mark Montigny would permit emergency personnel to treat injured police dogs and bring them to veterinary facilities, as long as there are no injured people still requiring a hospital transport.</p>
