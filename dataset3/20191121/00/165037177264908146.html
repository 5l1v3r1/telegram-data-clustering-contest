        <b>The draw for the Euro 2020 playoffs takes place in Nyon on Friday amid widespread confusion over the format and make up of the group stage for next year's finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The last four places in the tournament, </b>which is being hosted in 12 cities, will be <b>decided by March's playoffs,</b> with its 16-team make-up based on performances in the recent inaugural UEFA Nations League.</p>
      <p>That gives<b> teams that failed in the main qualifying campaign a second chance </b>to bag a spot, such as Northern Ireland and their neighbours the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The<b> Northern Irish will visit Bosnia and Herzegovina</b> on March 26 while the <b>Republic going to Slovakia </b>the same day, with the winners of those one-off ties meeting five days later with <b>a finals place at stake.</b></p>
      <p><b>Scotland</b> will have a home play-off against either <b>Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania</b>. Should they win that, they will then take on <b>Norway or Serbia </b>for a place in the finals.</p>
      <p>However, Scotland, Hungary and Romania are all <b>due to host matches next summer</b>, creating a potential headache for organisers should they each qualify for the Euros.</p>
      <p>The fact<b> the play-off winners will not be known until just two and a half months before</b> the start of the Euros on June 12, adds another layer of complication.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile much of the <b>suspense has already been removed </b>from the draw for the finals, which is being held in Bucharest on November 30, as<b> host nations have to play group games on home turf</b> and certain teams need to be kept apart for geopolitical reasons.</p>

      <p><b>Ukraine and Russia cannot face one another due to the conflict</b> in eastern Ukraine. That means <b>Belgium already know they will face Russia and Denmark</b> -- both of whom will host games -- in <b>Group B</b>, leaving little suspense come the draw for the finals.</p>
      <p>That led to <b>Kevin De Bruyne to call the format a "scandal",</b> while Ronald Koeman, whose Netherlands team have already been placed in <b>Group C with Ukraine, </b>asked the Dutch FA if he could avoid travelling to next week's group stage draw.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Play-off line-up</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Path A: </b>Iceland plus three from Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary and Romania</p>
      <p><b>Path B:</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina v Northern Ireland; Slovakia v Republic of Ireland</p>
      <p><b>Path C:</b> Scotland v one of Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania; Norway v Serbia</p>
      <p><b>Path D:</b> Georgia v Belarus; North Macedonia v Kosovo</p>
