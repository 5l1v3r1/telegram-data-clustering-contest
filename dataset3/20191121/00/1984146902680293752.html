      <p>Vulnerable North East children are at risk of becoming collateral damage in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>, a charity has warned.</p>
      <p>Up to 37 children in the region are at risk of domestic violence every day - the equivalent of more than 1,300 children during the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> period - a new report has revealed.</p>
      <p>The new Action for Children analysis, based on official figures from the Department for Education, comes as the future of the Domestic Abuse Bill hangs in the balance ahead of the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>The bill would place a legal duty on councils to offer secure homes for those fleeing violence and their children.</p>
      <p>It has fallen twice as it passed through Parliament to become law - firstly due to the Government's Prorogation attempt and now because of the election.</p>
      <p>Action for Children is now calling on all parties to make the bill a priority in the next Parliament.</p>
      <p>The charity's chief executive, Julie Bentley, said: "Leave or remain, our politicians must not allow children living in the terrifying shadow of domestic abuse to become part of the collateral damage of Brexit.</p>
      <p>"Every day our frontline workers see the emotional scars of domestic abuse on children in the North East and across the country.</p>
      <p>"From nightmares, flashbacks and bed-wetting to depression, or even wanting to end their lives, the effects can last a lifetime.</p>
      <p>"Too many people are facing these horrors unnoticed or without the right help.</p>
      <p>"We have to recognise these children for what they are - victims, not just witnesses."</p>
      <p>The charity says the latest figures are likely to be "just the tip of the iceberg" because evidence shows many cases go unreported.</p>
      <p>Nationally, Action for Children's report also reveals many children facing domestic abuse are living at the mercy of a 'postcode lottery' without the support they need from specialist services.</p>
      <p>The charity carried out an investigation with the University of Stirling and looked at domestic abuse services across England and Wales, including in-depth interviews with representative from 30 councils.</p>
      <p>It revealed more than 10% of councils interviews had no specialist support services for children affected by domestic abuse and access to services was restricted by the child's postcode in more than one third of local authorities.</p>
      <p>Two thirds of local authorities interviewed say their services for children are at risk in the long-term due to funding, the charity says.</p>
      <p>Ms Bentley added: "These vulnerable children desperately need help from our politicians.</p>
      <p>"We’re urging all parties to commit to prioritising a bill on domestic abuse in the next Parliament and fund the specialist services children desperately need.</p>
      <p>"The next Prime Minister must bring in a National Childhood Strategy to make sure children across the country have a safe and happy childhood.”</p>
