      <h1>These New Clean Beauty AHA Pads Have Transformed My Skin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:10:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:10</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Siegel</a></address>
      <p>A few weeks ago, I took home an unassuming white jar of pads not knowing anything about the brand or product. Little did I know that the pads inside would totally transform my skin's texture for the better. The product was the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/buy/Kinship-Insta-Swipe-Lemon-Honey-AHA-Pads-516670?url_pos=body-url&amp;p_name=Kinship%20Insta%20Swipe%20Lemon%20Honey%20AHA%20Pads&amp;retailer=lovekinship.com&amp;pid=516670&amp;price=22&amp;evar1=bella%3Aus&amp;evar3=article%3Agallery-one&amp;evar9=46914219&amp;evar98=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2Fbeauty%2Fkinship-insta-swipe-pads-review-46914219&amp;list1=beauty%20products%2Cbeauty%20review%2Cnewsletter%2Coriginal%20feature%2Cskincare&amp;prop13=desktop&amp;page_name=bella%3Aus%3Aarticle%3Akinship-insta-swipe-pads-review-46914219&amp;pdata=17359799">Kinship Insta Swipe Lemon Honey AHA Pads</a> ($22) in a sample packaging (not the beautiful sunny yellow final one) from an up-and-coming brand that makes clean products housed in recyclable packaging.</p>
      <p>As my skin started to improve over the next few weeks, I heard my coworkers raving about the <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/kinship-beauty-brand-sustainable-packaging-46893699">brand's amazing ethos</a>, which just made me even more excited about these little miracle workers.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Acids-Used-Skin-Care-37899335">alpha hydroxy acid</a> (AHA)-soaked pads work by chemically exfoliating the skin and dissolving dead cells, which has helped prevent bumps from forming on my acne-prone skin. I've tried plenty of other chemical exfoliant pads before, but the ingredients and sustainability efforts are different.</p>
      <h3>The Ingredients in Kinship Insta Swipe AHA Pads</h3>

      <p>In addition to the exfoliating ingredients, the pads include lemon for its antimicrobial properties (which also gives them a pleasant smell) and manuka honey (which, in addition to being antimicrobial, is also an anti-inflammatory). Lastly, the products are formulated with kinbiome, a plant-derived probiotic to help protect your skin barrier. This team of powerhouse ingredients made my skin look so smooth and <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Acne-Treatments-Dermatologists-Use-45486951">blemish-free</a> that my roommate asked me what I was using on my skin while I chatted with her while barefaced.</p>
      <h3>The Ethos of Kinship</h3>

      <p>On top of making my skin look radiant, these products fit within my values perfectly. I have become increasingly concerned with how much plastic I use, and I like that these pads are sold in a jar made from half ocean-waste plastic and half post-consumer recycled plastic. As for the pads, they're compostable, so they will break down even in a landfill. The product is also cruelty-free, which, as an animal-lover, is a top priority for me.</p>

      <p>Overall, this product is a win for me on all fronts. It makes my skin glow and doesn't harm the Earth, so now I'm raving about Kinship to my coworkers, too.</p>
