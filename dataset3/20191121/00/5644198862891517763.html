      <p>Citroen is leaving the world rally championship with immediate effect after six-times world champion Sebastien Ogier announced his departure from the team, the French manufacturer said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Citroen is leaving the world rally championship with immediate effect after six-times world champion Sebastien Ogier announced his departure from the team, the French manufacturer said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Citroen Racing said it had made the decision "due to the absence of a first-class driver available for (the) 2020 season."</p>

      <p>The motorsport.com website said Ogier was expected to be announced as a Toyota driver on Monday.</p>
      <p>Toyota's Estonian Ott Tanak won the driver's title in Spain last month, ending Ogier's six year reign, but announced four days later that he was joining Hyundai for 2020.</p>
      <p>Hyundai secured the manufacturers' crown when this month's season-ending Australian race was called off due to the threat of bushfires.</p>
      <p>"Our decision to withdraw from WRC programme as early as end of 2019 follows on Sebastien Ogier's choice to leave Citroen Racing," said Citroen CEO Linda Jackson.</p>
      <p>"We obviously have not wished this situation but we could not imagine 2020 season without Sebastien."</p>
