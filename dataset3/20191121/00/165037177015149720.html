        <b>Robert Moreno is free to start coaching immediately at whatever team in the First or Second Division. Despite have managed the Spanish national team this season, there are no rules that forbid him from doing so.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to what Ramon Fuentes reports in the newspaper 'Sport', after his<b> brisk exit from the Spanish national team, Robert Moreno</b> could coach from now on at whatever team he wanted in the <b>First or Second Division.</b></p>
      <p>After having signed his settlement with the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF), the former Spain coach is on the market to immediately take charge of any team in the gold or silver category of Spanish football.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is because<b> there are no rules that prevent him from doing so, </b>since the statutory limitation to manage more than one team<b> affects only the clubs and not national teams.</b></p>
      <p>In addition, this regulation does not prevent a former coach of the First or Second Divison from also serving as Spain coach, as could be the case of <b>Juan Carlos Unzue,</b> former coach of Girona this year, who sounds to be the <b>second to Luis Enrique at the head of the Selection.</b></p>
