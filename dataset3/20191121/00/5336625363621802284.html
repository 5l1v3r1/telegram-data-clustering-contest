      <h1>Trump's White House lawn rant sounds better as a pop punk ballad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:25:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/morgan-sung/" target="_blank">Morgan Sung</a></address>
      <p>Trump's Sharpie-written notes are a tragically catchy pop punk song now. </p>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland gave a <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sondland-impeachment-hearing-opening-statement-reactions/">damning testimony</a> against Donald Trump during Wednesday's impeachment hearing. He claimed that the Trump administration, including the president, was aware of quid pro quo in Ukraine. </p>
      <p>The president, meanwhile, took to the White House lawn to reiterate once again that he had done anything wrong. Photographs of his notes from the appearance show the words "I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO" scrawled on a pad in what appears to be marker. </p>
      <p>It was only a matter of time before someone turned his bizarre statement into a song. </p>
      <p>Musician Nick Lutsko, who has turned the president's speeches into pop punk ballads before, reworked the now-infamous Sharpie statement into an emo song worthy of the most angsty hair flips. </p>

      <p>Honestly, it kind of slaps. If Warped Tour still happened, this would be the song to open the pit. </p>
      <p>It also inspired these horrifying renderings of what emo Trump would look like. </p>

      <p>If you want to subject yourself to <i>ten minutes </i>of emo Trump's whining, Lutsko also made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00zDd3Hg_Gc&amp;feature=youtu.be">medley</a> of his speeches-turned-pop punk songs. </p>
