      <p>CAIRO - 21 November 2019: The U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) announced that its Chief Executive Officer Adam Boehler will exist in Egypt during Nov. 21 – 23, in order to promote U.S. investment, attend the Investment for Africa Forum, and strengthen regional relationships in pursuit of shared development goals in the region. <br/><br/>DFC clarified that this visit follows recent travel by Boehler to the Indo-Pacific, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa to strengthen relationships with key partners and highlight DFC’s enhanced flexibility to support private sector investment in critical regions. <br/><br/>“Africa is home to immense untapped opportunity that will yield a more prosperous, stable, and secure future for communities across the continent,” said Boehler. “I look forward to joining regional government officials, business leaders, and investors in Egypt to identify avenues through which we can collaborate to achieve our shared vision for Africa.” <br/><br/>DFC clarified that in Egypt, Boehler will attend the Investment for Africa Forum in Cairo to underscore DFC’s commitment to the continent and will meet with regional business leaders to explore investment opportunities in priority areas such as infrastructure development and women’s economic empowerment. <br/><br/>"He will also seek to advance key agency initiatives, including Connect Africa, 2X Africa, and DFC’s new collaboration with the African Development Bank, all of which advance the goals of the Administration’s Prosper Africa effort to increase two-way investment and trade between the U.S. and Africa," it added. <br/><br/>Moreover, Boehler will hold meetings with high-ranking government officials to enhance cooperation in support of regional development, economic growth, and stability. <br/><br/>DFC's investments in Egypt currently exceeds $1.5 billion in sectors ranging from infrastructure to financial services and healthcare. <br/><br/>DFC is a new U.S. Government agency that combines and modernizes the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and USAID’s Development Credit Authority (DCA), with a more than doubled investment cap of $60 billion.</p>
