      <h1>Abe Forsythe, He Of ‘Always Greener’ Fame, Just Got Tapped To Direct ‘Robocop’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T00:33:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 00:33</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>Hey kids, remember <i>Always Greener</i>? Australian comedy-drama series about a pair of families who agree to swap their city/country homes so they can both get a sorely needed change of scenery? But with that came teething problems and culture shock as the fast-paced city kids adjusted to the slower country life and the country family struggled to keep up with everything in the city? <b>Abe Forsythe</b>, one of the stars of that hugely beloved 2002-2003 series, has just been tapped by a major Hollywood studio to direct the newest instalment in the storied <i>Robocop </i>franchise. Hooley bloody dooley.</p>
      <p>Those of you who follow the local film and TV industries closely will already be well aware of Forsythe’s rising career behind the camera, which has been building for some time now.</p>
      <p>Forsythe’s latest project, a low budget zombie comedy called <i>Little Monsters</i>, sported a red hot cast headed up by <b>Lupita Nyong’o</b> and premiered at this year’s prestigious Sundance Film Festival to almost universally positive reviews.</p>

      <p>The buzz from that film was apparently enough to get Hollywood interested, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robocop-returns-lands-little-monsters-director-abe-forsythe-1256699?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_source=t.co&amp;utm_medium=referral">and now <i>The Hollywood Reporter </i>has confirmed</a> that Forsythe will direct <i>Robocop Returns </i>for major studio MGM.</p>
      <p>The project is intended as a direct sequel to the iconic 1987 film, which featured a battered up police officer rebuilt by technology to be half man, half machine, and all cop.</p>
      <p>Forsythe will also re-write the script for the film, which has been in development for a number of years now. As late as last year, the project had <i>District 9 </i>creator <b>Neill Blomkamp </b>attached to it.</p>
      <p>But from here, it’s all Abe, baby. The plum gig represents a huge step up in budget and scale for the 38-year-old, as well as the first time he’ll be helming a major American production.</p>
      <p>Not a bad effort at all, really.</p>
