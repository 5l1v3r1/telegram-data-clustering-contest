      <h1>Wu Lei earning half of what he did in China</h1>

        <b>There are players who make financial sacrifices when changing clubs, and then there is the Chinese Wu Lei, the visible face of Espanyol in the Far East.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We are speaking directly of a sacrifice, because according to 'Titan Sports Plus', <b>Wu Lei</b> is making about <b>half as much at Espanyol as he did when playing in China</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Chinese players earn less money</b> when they play outside their country because European football can't compete with the <b>millionaire salaries</b> that are paid there.</p>

      <p>There are even more cases where the difference is greater, such as that of <b>Xizhe Zhang, who at Wolfsburg earned a third of what he got at Beijing Guoan</b>. He was only there a few months, the final part of the 2014-15 season, and did not play at all. He pocketed <b>half a million euros for it</b>.</p>
