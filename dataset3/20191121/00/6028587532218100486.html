      <p>Less than two years after unmanageable debt and a bank foreclosure forced San Diego-based <a href="https://www.greenflashbrew.com/">Green Flash Brewing</a> to <a href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/green-flash-brings-new-investors-shutters-virginia-beach-brewery">sell to a holding company, auction off its $20 million expansion brewery in Virginia Beach, close its Southern California barrel-aging facility, and pull beer distribution from 42 states to concentrate on its home and neighboring markets</a>, the brewery that helped pioneer the industry-transforming <a href="https://www.greenflashbrew.com/our-beers/west-coast-ipa/">west coast IPA style</a> has quietly returned to the eastern seaboard. As of this month, the company — that has also <a href="https://craftbusinessdaily.com/green-flash-shuttering-lincoln-brewpub-to-focus-on-things-like-new-hazy-ipa-saturhaze/">just closed its Nebraska brewpub </a>after fewer than 18 months — is selling small quantities of liquid in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Its subsidiary brand, <a href="https://alpinebeerco.com/">Alpine Beer</a>, comes along with it.Vice President of Sales and Business Development Bracken Todd says the limited eastward migration won’t occupy much of the company’s energy as it emerges from its reorganizing and retrenching period, which started after an approximately four-month period of financial chaos at the beginning of 2018. Going forward, 17-year-old Green Flash will double down on selling its core brands and continue to focus heavily on California, Nevada and Arizona while selectively choosing a few long-distance markets where it makes sense to do so.</p>
      <p>“We want to make sure we’re doing it intelligently as opposed to using a shot-gun approach as we did before,” he says, adding that the brewery previously expanded from distributing in 20 states to 50 in just three years. “We’ll send small quantities as needed to the east coast. The last thing we want is to be sitting on a shelf.”</p>
      <p>The main reason for making the expensive decision to jump from one coast to another is that Todd says drinkers in Boston and Philadelphia have never stopped asking for the beer, both online and in person. One Pittsburgh distributor actually never stopped selling it, and he says the company’s old wholesalers in and around those resurgent cities seem happy to bring it back.</p>
      <p>“We’re picking places that have that mentality where we know the consumer is educated and isn’t necessarily unwilling to try good beer from somewhere else. Plus our branding fits a coastal theme and craft beer indexes higher on the coasts. You gotta fish where the fish are,” he says.</p>
      <p>Todd and his team have identified a few additional markets they may reopen in the next one-to-six months, though he won’t announce them until they’re solidified. Otherwise, he says, he’s distributing 40% of his liquid to San Diego, 20% to metro Los Angeles, 20% to the Bay Area and the remaining 20% everywhere else. Key to this strategy is keeping a tight focus on core brands – <a href="https://www.greenflashbrew.com/beer/">West Coast IPA (which has gotten a retro update back to its original, pre-2005, lower-alcohol formulation) and Tropical DNA hazy IPA</a>, plus <a href="https://alpinebeerco.com/our-beer/">Alpine’s Duet, HFS and Nelson IPAs</a>.</p>

      <p>That’s not to say brewers won’t put out any one-offs. But in unique twist for the industry (and one that could set precedent for many of Green Flash and Alpine competitors), the sales team will release an annual calendar for specialty releases, take pre-orders from distributors and only make enough to meet actual demand.</p>
      <p>“We’re not brewing them to a specific batch quantity,” Todd says. “It keeps our focus on our core portfolio and ensures we have fresh beer out there. If all you’re dependent on is on-off special release beers you’re one bad beer away from shutting your doors.”</p>
      <p>Like several other coastal breweries, Green Flash has refreshed its brand to reflect a more beachy lifestyle and has put all of its beers in cans for the first time. It’s banking on a blockbuster 2020 with a new core product pre-released at San Diego Beer Week this past October: <a href="https://www.greenflashbrew.com/our-beers/saturhaze/">Saturhaze</a>, a 4.2% hazy IPA it’ll support with posters that have tear-off coupons redeemable at the brewery and with sales at the Rose Bowl and at spring training stadiums. Todd says Saturhaze satisfies three major beer trends: hazy, low-alcohol, and ready-to-go for an active lifestyle.</p>
      <p>He suggests that going forward it’ll be advantageous for Green Flash to keep its business model relatively simple. A few years ago, the brewery badly mis-forecast future sales trends and drastically overleveraged itself to expand capacity (as did many others), including building the short-lived taproom in remote Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>
      <p>Since then, they’ve <a href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/green-flash-brewing-hires-top-anheuser-busch-executive-new-ceo">hired some former Big Beer executives</a> to reposition the brewery and they insist they won’t be fooled again.</p>
      <p>“We are hellbent on being a craft brewer that’s around forever, not one that’s going to go away any time soon,” Todd says.</p>
