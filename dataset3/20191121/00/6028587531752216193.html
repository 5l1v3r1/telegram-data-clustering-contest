      <h1>Just One More Reason To Visit The Dream Downtown: An Instagrammable Art Collection</h1>

      <p>There are three main reasons why New Yorkers go to the Dream Downtown. One, it’s a go-to-be-seen kind of place. Two, the cocktails are great. Three, the glass-bottom swimming pool above the lobby provides hours of free entertainment.Now, the Dream is attempting to add a fourth, somewhat loftier, enticement: the art. The hotel recently joined forces with Saatchi Art, the popular online art gallery, for a year-long partnership that will introduce emerging artists from around the world to hotel guests and locals alike. Which actually makes a lot of sense, given the Dream Downtown is surrounded by some of the city’s best art galleries.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, artist Bollee Patino used acrylic and spray pain to create a highly Instagrammable graffiti installation inspired by New York’s vibrant street art. I recently spoke with Gwendolyn Kimmelman, Dream Downtown’s area director of digital marketing,<b> </b>about what hotel guests and punters alike can expect from the Saatchi Art partnership moving forward.</p>

        <b>Can you please tell me about the Saatchi Art partnership, how it came about, and what it involves?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The DNA of the Dream brand goes hand in hand with all things lifestyle and culture. We make it a point to incorporate activations at our properties across all lifestyle verticals—fashion, food, music, and visual art. We like to feature both local and emerging artists from around the country. Saatchi Art matched our brand in both aesthetic and values, so partnering with them for a quarterly “artist in residency” installation made a lot of sense for both brands.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Saatchi Art has made buying art an easy and affordable process for many young people. Is that what attracted you to partnering with them?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We love the idea of making art accessible to all. Our partnership with Saatchi grants an opportunity for artists to increase their exposure and provides the hotel with a constant rotation of new art for guests and visitors to enjoy. It’s a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why is the partnership with only Dream Downtown, and not Dream Midtown as well? Was there some thinking that guided that decision (perhaps to do with trendy neighborhoods, local art communities, and so on)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The partnership is in place for both properties. Initially it started at Downtown since the Meatpacking District  is so close to the Chelsea art galleries. Art has always been a part of Dream Downtown’s core—but now we are expanding art as a cultural spotlight to all Dream properties. You can expect to see pieces from our Saatchi partnership at Dream Midtown in December.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you give me an overview of Dream’s art program overall? What is the overall thinking behind the program, and what other partnerships have you curated?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We seek artists who share the same values and aesthetic as us—innovative, visionary, and not afraid to take a risk. We look for art partnerships that come about organically, have meaning behind them, and extend beyond just the art itself. For example, last year around the holidays, we partnered with the American Red Cross to create “Shelter,” a mural by Eric ‘Mobē’ Bass that stood as a symbol of our commitment to preserving our country’s beautiful landscapes. On the mural, we invited guests to text and donate to the American Red Cross to support disaster relief.</p>
      <p>We also like to add multiple layers into our activations. Last year for Valentine’s Day, we partnered with artist James Goldcrown, famous for his Bleeding Hearts/Lovewall murals. Not only did he create a full heart mural, NYC-based tattoo artist Evan Kim of Evan Tattoo set up shop on property to give guests complimentary heart tattoos.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you find and work with emerging artists? And how does Dream in general work with and help the local arts community?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As with many of our partnerships, opportunities come to us from all different angles. It’s a mix of inbound collaboration requests and outreach from our teams to artists that we respect and want to work with. As a company, we have always understood the importance of promoting the arts and supporting our community. Our hotels are built with the local community in mind and we recognize this as a capital part of our success on a whole.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Just in general, how important do you think a robust art program is to hotel properties whose target demographic skews a little younger? Do you find young people are interested in art, and if so, how do you measure that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Young people are definitely interested in art, they just consume it in a different way. In the age of social media, it is important to evolve with the times. This doesn’t mean automatically ruling out classic pieces—just presenting them with a modern twist. The amount of tags, shares, location check-ins a piece of art generates in the digital landscape is infinitely valuable for brand awareness. On top of all that, the art featured is all for sale, and we’ve been successful in selling a piece already.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are some of your favorite pieces in Dream’s art program, and why?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We love the current piece that’s featured at Dream Downtown by Bollee Patino. He was on property to create it in real time so guests could watch the process as they moved in and out of the Swing Room. He incorporated elements from the Dream brand, getting inspired by the property around him. It was the perfect piece to kick off the summer with wave imagery, bright colors, and a fun, carefree vibe.</p>
