      <p>Compared to previous debates this year, the Wednesday night debate was down, both compared to the most recent debate last month–and to the first debates of the Democratic primary campaign.</p>
      <p>The ratings dropped from the last Democratic debate, in October, which aired on CNN and drew a total audience of 8.3 million viewers–which itself was down from earlier debates in the 2020 campaign, with the first of two nights of the first debate drawing 15 million viewers across three networks: NBC, MSNBC and Telemundo. The third debate, which aired on ABC and Univision, drew 14 million.</p>
      <p>MSNBC’s livestream of the debate generated more than 1.3 million live streams across NBCNews.com, MSNBC.com and NBC News NOW on OTT devices, with all digital coverage delivering more than five million total views, an increase of 14% from NBC’s last debate in June.</p>
