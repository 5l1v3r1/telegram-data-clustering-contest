      <p>Meghan Trainor has just had some major dental work done, and she’s got the hilarious video to prove it.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the “All About That Bass” singer took to Instagram to share video of herself after having all four of her wisdom teeth removed — which she admitted wasn’t originally the plan.</p>
      <p>“I was initially going to just take one wisdom tooth out. The dentist said they all had to go. Wasn’t emotionally or mentally prepared but sure got some great content 😩😭😂 ,” she wrote, adding, “the second vid is me talking to my amazing manager @tommybruce who literally has my whole heart haha thank u to the amazing dentist and my family for taking such good care of me💖”</p>

      <p>“We call him ‘Serial Killer’ because he looks crazy in a lot of pictures,” she explained. “But, also, he does, like, suspicious things that we’re like, ‘Are you a serial killer and we just haven’t figured it out yet?’ Like, he’ll go to the movies by himself, but not, like, just one movie, like four back-to-back. Like, solo dolo.”</p>
