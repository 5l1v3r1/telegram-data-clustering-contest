      <p>Accra, Nov.20, GNA - A 25 year old teacher who allegedly engaged in sexual misconduct with a 15 year old girl at Adenta has appeared before an Accra Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Prince Owusu Banahene is alleged to have allowed the victim to suck his manhood and also inserted his fingers into the victim's vagina.</p>
      <p>Charged with indecent assault, Banahene has denied the offence.</p>
      <p>The court presided over by Mr Rita Abrokwah- Doko admitted the accused person to bail in the sum of GHÂ¢10,000.00 with three sureties to reappear on December 13.</p>
      <p>This was after his counsel Louis Boakye Yiadom who held brief for Dela Blagogee had pray for bail for the accused person.</p>
      <p>The court has further ordered the prosecution to provide the defence or the accused with all documents they intend to rely on.</p>
      <p>Prosecuting Chief Inspector Kofi Atimbire said the complainant is a carpenter residing at Adenta with his family including the victim.</p>
      <p>The prosecution said the victim is a Junior High School graduate and in that year 2017, she met the accused person in a public transport and became friends and later they exchanged phone numbers.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said the accused person's wife noticed the relationship between the victim and accused and warned the accused to stay away from the victim which he obliged.</p>
      <p>Mr Atimbire said in May this year, victim met Banahene again and she introduced him to her father as a teacher and a friend who wanted to assist her in the June BECE exams.</p>
      <p>Prosecution said Banahene took advantage of that and he made the victim to suck his penis on three different occasions.</p>
      <p>Again prosecution said the accused also inserted his fingers into her vagina.</p>
      <p>The Prosecution said it was when accused had allegedly informed the victim that he wanted to have sex with her before she goes to Senior High School that she informed her youth class teachers who also alerted the complainant.</p>
      <p>He said a report was lodged with the Domestic Violence and Victims Support Unit at Madina and Banahene was arrested</p>
