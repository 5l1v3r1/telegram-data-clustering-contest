      <p><b>Best</b> Android Phones Under $300 Android Central 2019</p>
      <p>You can get a lot of phone for a modest price these days. Motorola has been a leading name in midrange options for years, and that holds true with its excellent new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07N92347B/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU58750YYw">Moto G7</a>. For an extremely competitive price, you get capable specs with a big display and simple software that anyone can figure out. Plus it has TurboPower fast charging, and finally uses USB-C.</p>

      <h3>Best Overall: Moto G7</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/03/moto-g7-review-1.jpg?itok=l-nMH6N3"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The Moto G7 has just about everything you could ask of a phone at this price. The software is clean yet clever with Moto Actions and Moto Display, and it's quick to recharge with Motorola's TurboPower charging. The G7 also has decent specs, including a Snapdragon 632, 64GB of expandable storage, and 4GB of RAM — and it finally charges over USB-C!</p>
      <p>The design is sleek and modern with trim display bezels and a rear fingerprint sensor, the camera is impressive for its field, and it's even splash-resistant (though keep in mind that that's <i>not</i> the same as full-blown water resistance). Plus, you'll always be able to enjoy Motorola's simple and useful software.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple and effective software</li>
        <li>Compatible with all U.S. carriers</li>
        <li>USB-C charging</li>
        <li>Splash resistance</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Just average battery life</li>
        <li>Questionable software update future</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Overall</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>Everything you need, for a great price.</p>
      <p>The Moto G has always been a staple of this market, with good reason. The Moto G7 is an outstanding value in every right.</p>

      <h3>Midrange Done Right: Samsung Galaxy A50</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Samsung is best known for its high-end phones, but the A50 steps into the mid-range extremely well. The 6.4-inch display is bigger and much nicer than you'd expect for something that competes at this price, as is the beautiful hardware. The spec sheet is strong, with a 4000mAh battery and capable processor. You'll have to face some Samsung-induced bloatware in the software, but the A50 is a great overall phone.</p>
      <p>The 25-megapixel main camera is capable in good and mixed lighting, though as expected for this price point comes up short in lower light. But what's surprising for this money is the addition of both a dedicated wide-angle camera, which takes fun shots with a new perspective, <i>and</i> a dedicated depth camera for portrait shots.</p>
      <p>In order to hit the right price point you need to buy an international model, but we think it's worth it considering how much you save and everything you get for the money.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Top-tier display</li>
        <li>Strong battery life</li>
        <li>Solid triple camera</li>
        <li>Great specs for the money</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Considerable bloatware</li>
        <li>Portrait mode shots are weak</li>
        <li>No MST Samsung Pay</li>
        <li>U.S. model more expensive than international</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Midrange Done Right</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>Great Samsung quality for a fraction of the price.</p>
      <p>The A50 brings high-end Samsung DNA, with great specs and a big display. The triple camera is good and has a fun wide-angle lens.</p>

      <h3>Great Affordable Option: Honor 8X</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brw/public/article_images/2019/02/honor-8x%20_13__0.jpg?itok=t9Ui66fc"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The Honor 8X may be inexpensive, but it feels more expensive with its head-turning glass design and zippy EMUI 9 interface overtop Android 9 Pie. Its dual cameras take surprisingly good photos, and the specs are outstanding for the price — an octa-core Kirin 710 chipset and 4 or 6GB of RAM. The 3,750 mAh battery is always good for a full day, though it unfortunately charges over Micro-USB.</p>
      <p>Some corners were cut with the Honor 8X. There's no water-resistance,, which is common on newer models,, and there are too many apps with EMUI. Overall, it's a smartphone that really shows you don't have to shell out a lot of cash.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Excellent spec sheet</li>
        <li>Huge high-quality display</li>
        <li>Beautiful colorful design</li>
        <li>Premium two-tone glass finish</li>
        <li>Massive battery goes all day long</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>EMUI, while smooth, comes with too many apps</li>
        <li>Outdated charging and power options</li>
        <li>No water resistance</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Great Affordable Option</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>An incredible value across the board.</p>
      <p>The Honor 8X looks and feels expensive, and has strong specs. Its 6.5-inch screen is one of the biggest you'll find at this price.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4WRXXT/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU58750YYw">$225 at Amazon</a>

      <h3>Best with Android One: Nokia 6.2</h3>

      <p>Good software is hard to come by with Android phones in this price range, but the Nokia 6.2 is a wonderful exception to that rule. It ships with a clean build of Android 9 Pie that's fast and easy to navigate, and since it's based on the Android One program, it's guaranteed to receive software updates and security patches for the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>As for the Nokia 6.2's hardware, it's rock solid. You get a premium glass design, a 6.3-inch Full HD+ display, and three rear cameras. There's also a Snapdragon 636 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 512GB using a microSD card.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple and clean Android One software</li>
        <li>Guaranteed updates</li>
        <li>Sleek glass design</li>
        <li>Very pretty display</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The Moto E6 packs many of the features that make the Moto G7 great and cuts back where necessary to hit a much lower price. You get capable specs, a pretty big display, fine battery size, and the same simple Moto software with a good set of features. You also get a water-repellent coating and support for all U.S. carriers with a full warranty.</p>
      <p>On the downside, the 720p display isn't going to wow you, nor will the camera. You also to charge over the older Micro-USB. Fortunately, the money was spent where it matters: the phone's features and capabilities. The Moto E6 walks a good line for such a great price.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for all U.S. carriers</li>
        <li>Water repellent coating</li>
        <li>Simple software with good features</li>
        <li>3.5 mm headphone jack</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Plastic build</li>
        <li>Only 720p screen resolution</li>
        <li>Micro-USB charging</li>

      <h3>Outstanding Battery Life: Moto G7 Power</h3>

      <p>Everyone has different wants and needs when it comes to smartphones, but one feature we can all agree on being highly important is battery life. If you've been looking for a phone that can last for more than one day per charge, the Moto G7 Power is for you.</p>
      <p>With a massive 5,000 mAh battery, Motorola touts that you can expect up to 2.5 days of use on a single charge, making the G7 Power one of the longest-lasting phones on the market. We're also a fan of its expandable storage (up to 512GB), the clean Android Pie software with Motorola's add-ons (like Moto Display and Moto Actions), and being able to press the power button twice to summon Alexa at any time.</p>
      <p>Perhaps even more enticing, the Moto G7 Power works with all major U.S. carriers — including AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon. We do wish that there was more than just 32GB of onboard storage and that camera quality was better, but for battery enthusiasts, the G7 Power is the way to go.</p>
      <h4>Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Huge 5,000 mAh battery</li>
        <li>Expandable storage</li>
        <li>Clean software with Motorola goodies</li>
        <li>Alexa push-to-talk</li>
        <li>Works on any U.S. carrier</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Mediocre camera</li>
        <li>Just 32GB of internal storage</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Outstanding Battery Life</h4>

      <h3>Has a Stylus: LG Stylo 5</h3>

      <p>The Galaxy Note series is the most popular for making the most of a stylus-touting phone, but if you don't have the cash for a flagship Note, the LG Stylo 5 is worth a look. Just like the Note, it has an included stylus that you can hide inside the phone when you aren't using it. Unlike the Note, however, the Stylo 5 is very affordable.</p>
      <p>With the Stylo 5's stylus, you can draw, take notes, and navigate the UI — something that's quite handy when trying to tap small buttons on the screen. You also get a 6.2-inch Full HD+ display, Android 9 Pie, and 32GB of storage that can be expanded up to 2TB. There's also Alexa push-to-talk support, meaning you can double-press the power button at any time to check in with the assistant.</p>
      <p>The single 13MP camera won't knock your socks off anytime soon and the plastic design isn't the nicest we've ever seen, but as far as stylus-touting phones go, the Stylo 5 is a strong option.</p>

It's also a great size with enough screen room to get things done without feeling too large.</p>
      <p>Amazingly, the Android market has many other great options for you at affordable prices, but when you're looking to save money, there are going to be compromises. When shopping for these phones, take a close look at the specs to make sure you're not missing a feature you'd like to have. Many inexpensive phones will cut out on display size, display resolution, extra cameras or bonuses like stereo speakers. However, when you shop around, you'll be able to get a great phone for just a few hundred bucks.</p>
      <h3>How to find the best Black Friday deals on Android phones under $300</h3>
      <p>Buying a new Android phone can be a pretty daunting task, especially when trying to keep prices low. You want to buy something that'll be able to do everything you need, but getting a quality handset without breaking the bank is no easy task. If you aren't sure where to get started, here are a few pointers to keep in mind. First thing's first, what features are a priority for you? Do you take a lot of pictures? If so, you'll want a good camera. A high megapixel count translates to a more detailed photo, and some phones have multiple cameras that allow for you to zoom in on subjects or capture more in the frame. The display is another factor to think about. A larger screen will be more difficult to use with one hand, but it'll also be better-suited for watching movies and playing games. Similarly, a higher screen resolution means everything on the phone will be more crisp and easier on the eyes. Last but certainly not least, keep an eye on the battery capacity of the phone you're looking at. The larger mAh count it has, the longer it'll last on a single charge.</p>
      <p>As we head into Black Friday, what kind of deals are we expecting? Motorola tends to offer great savings around this time of year, so discounts on the Moto G7 and Moto E6 are going to be at the top of our radar. Samsung has also been known to get into the Black Friday spirit, so if you're eyeing the Galaxy A50, there's a strong chance it'll be discounted to some degree, too. We also wouldn't be surprised if Nokia, Honor, and just about every Android phone maker does what it can to grab the attention of holiday shoppers. In other words, if you've been eyeing a budget Android phone, you couldn't ask for a better time to buy one.</p>
      <p>We're in full Black Friday deal-hunting mode, keeping an eye on the latest and greatest deals as they pop up. As we find them, they'll be added right here.
