      <h1>Prince Andrew resigns as Outward Bound Trust patron as duke's crisis deepens</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, has stepped down from one of the Royals' favourite charities and this will be a 'huge disappointment' to his father, Prince Philip, who was patron since 1953</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:16:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:16</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew has stepped down down from his role as patron of the Outward Bound Trust charity as the fallout from his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein continues.</p>
      <p>The charity was one of the royal family's favourites. The Duke Of York's father, Prince Philip, had supported Outward Bound as patron from 1953 until earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The prince took over the role from his father the Duke of Edinburgh in March.</p>
      <p>Outward Bound is an educational charity that uses outdoor adventures to help disadvantaged children progress in life.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the charity said: "The board of The Outward Bound Trust has today accepted the resignaiton as Patron of HRH The Duke of York following his announcement yesterday that he will be withdrawing from public duties for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>"The Board thanks HRH The Duke of York for his support over many years."</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Andrew has also today stepped down from his role as Chancellor of Huddersfield University, the university has confirmed, after its students' union voted last night to campaign for him to stand down as the ceremonial head.</p>
      <p>The University had initially backed the Prince, saying his "enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship is a natural fit with the work of the university."  </p>
      <p>But in a statement this afternoon, Huddersfield University Students' Union said: "This morning, we've received confirmation from the university that the duke has stepped down from his position with immediate effect to allow the university to appoint a new chancellor.</p>

      <p>"We know that students will welcome this decision, and the Students' Union would like to offer our sympathy to the victims of Epstein and all those affected by sexual abuse across the world." </p>
      <p>In a statement the university said: "HRH The Duke of York has announced he is stepping back from Royal duties for a period of time. </p>
      <p>"Due to the circumstances and in discussion with the University, he has decided to step down immediately to allow the University to appoint a successor."</p>
      <p>Other organisations are considering ditching their involvement with the prince.</p>

      <p>The British Exploring Society is understood to be holding a meeting this week to discuss the situation.</p>
      <p>The Jubilee Sailing Trust is understood to be reviewing the duke’s patronage next month while the youth charities Positive2 and the Golf Foundation say they are “monitoring the situation closely”.</p>
      <p>Banking giant Barclays threatened to cancel its involvement with entrepreneur scheme Pitch@Palace saying it was “concerned” about the situation and is keeping its involvement “under review”.</p>
      <p>At least two universities in the UK and three in Australia have ended their relationship with the scheme or said were reviewing it.</p>
      <p>And a row has broken out at one of the country’s most prestigious mixed public schools over its association with Andrew.</p>
      <p>Parents are demanding action over the Duke’s links to the Royal Hospital School, in Ipswich.</p>
      <p>A source said: “Prince Andrew’s continued involvement with the school is causing great alarm among many people.”</p>
      <p>A statement from the school read: “There are no plans for the Duke to visit the school.”</p>
      <p>Royal correspondent Chris Ship tweeted to say: "This will be a huge disappointment to Prince Andrew’s father, The Duke of Edinburgh."</p>
      <p>Andrew has been forced to step back from his more than 200 charity patronages.</p>
      <p>However the Prince has revealed he plans to continue working with Pitch@Palace, a decision which has been described as "not tenable", by a source close to a sponsor of the initiative.</p>
      <p>The source said: "To say you're stepping back from public life but then carry on is not a tenable position by the palace, and I think the sponsor shares that view.</p>
      <p>"We really want the programme to continue and succeed, because it's a valuable programme, but if it's going to continue to have reputational problems then we'll have to walk away from our contract."</p>

      <p>The scandal-hit prince faced criticism and calls to co-operate with the FBI after his "car crash" BBC Newsnight interview about his paedophile pal Epstein and claims he had sex with a 17-year-old trafficking victim.</p>
      <p>American lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims have blasted the Duke over his latest statement and hinted that the Queen's son could be subpoenaed to force him to answer questions under oath.</p>
      <p>Following Saturday night's interview, Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's alleged victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the pervert, who killed himself in a New York prison while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Andrew has repeatedly denied claims that he had sex with Epstein accuser Victoria Giuffre (nee Roberts) on three occasions when she was a teen.</p>
      <p>Andrew claims an alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen, as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>Andrew will no longer receive his £249,000 royal allowance which is taxpayers' money from the Sovereign Grant and he has been ditched by a number of companies and charities.</p>
      <p>It has emerged that the Queen, 93, summoned Andrew - said to be her favourite son - to Buckingham Palace in central London from his home, the Grade II-listed Royal Lodge, on Wednesday as the scandal deepened.</p>
      <p>She had held crisis talks with future king Prince Charles, 71, who is said to have lobbied for his younger brother to be removed.</p>
