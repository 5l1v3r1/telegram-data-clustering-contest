        <b>Victor Osimhen who currently plays for French club Lille has reportedly emerged as a target for newly appointed Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277255-jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-manager-10-months-losing-man-united-job.html">replaced Mauricio Pochettino</a> at Tottenham on Wednesday, November 20, and the Portuguese has started preparation for his first game against West Ham United.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager has been given the mandate to save the club from going down this season as they currently occupy 14th position on the standings.</p>
      <p>And according to the report by Jeunes Footeux, Jose Mourinho is ready to table an impressive deal for Lille when the January transfer window opens to lure Osimhen to England.</p>

      <p>Mourinho believes the 20-year-old Nigeria striker can support Harry Kane upfront in his squad next year.</p>
      <p>Victor Osimhen has been impressive this season for Lille in all competitions scoring seven goals in the League as well as scoring against Chelsea in the Champions League.</p>

      <p>He has also been superb for <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/695-super-eagles.html">Super Eagles</a> since Odion Ighalo retired from the national team after the 2019 African Cup of Nations in Egypt.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lille might not want to sell Victor Osimhen in January 2019 considering how superb he has been for them this season.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Nigeria's Super Eagles <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276505-lesotho-nigeria-osimhen-scores-brace-super-eagles-thrash-crocodiles-4-2.html">cruised to 4-2 win over Lesotho</a> in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Setsoto Stadium in which Osimhen scored brace.</p>
      <p>The three-time African kings got the game started on a flat-foot as they allowed the host to take the lead in the 11th minute through a superb header from Masoabi Nkoto.</p>
