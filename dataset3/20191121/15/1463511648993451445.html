      <p>Fans have continued to flood social media with congratulatory messages following Afro-fusion star, Damini Ogulu, aka Burna Boy’s Grammy nomination.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria reports that Burna Boy’s inclusion in the prestigious Grammy nomination list broke the internet when it was announced on Wednesday evening.</p>
      <p>He was nominated in the ‘Best World Music Album’ category for his album ‘African Giant’ which also featured Angelique Kidjo who was nominated in the same category.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the nominations, Burna Boy via his twitter handle @Burnaboy, “African Giant is Grammy Nominated! Its been a crazy day, so Grateful.</p>
      <p>“Special shout-out to everyone on the album from the producers to co-producers to featured Artists to Engineers.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate all your input to making the album. We should all be very proud. #grammys  #GRAMMYNoms.’’</p>
      <p>@IvieAni said, “Burna Boy deserves this Grammy nomination. We saw it coming from miles away. The Grammy still having a World Music category is still questionable though.’’</p>
      <p>@Omojuwa tweeted, “I am glad Burna Boy let the greatness come through…it was always there, always apparent. Everyone with an eye for genuine talent could see it. Here we are!’’</p>
      <p>@Theshawnife said, “When Burna Boy called himself an African Giant, there was outrage on Social Media for days.</p>
      <p>“Since then, his album has made mad waves! In the African Giant song he said he would win a GRAMMY.</p>
      <p>“Now he’s en route to doing that, he literally spoke it into existence! A KING, WE STAN.’’</p>
      <p>@Fifunmi said, “Burna Boy nominated for a Grammy award.</p>
      <p>“I’m proud of the #AfricanGiant and proud to be part of the group who promoted the great album. It was worth it’’.</p>
      <p>In January, Burna Boy earned the moniker ‘African Giant’ following a swipe at Coachella for writing his name in small fonts for the event’s promotional posters.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that he accused the summer festival of disrespecting him and tagged himself an ‘African Giant’ causing a huge social media debate.</p>
      <p>Burna Boy eventually performed at Coachella in April alongside Mr Eazi and subsequently named his album ‘African Giant’. </p>
