      <p>Cape Town - <b>Lions</b> and <b>Springbok</b> No 8 <b>Warren Whiteley's</b> playing career is seemingly hanging in the balance.</p>
      <p>This comes after <b><a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Rugby/Super-Rugby/whiteley-speel-nie-superrugby-vir-leeus-in-2020-20191121?fbclid=IwAR3MR1Lmle5CjOa_skhaMObWisu2afdO60g3Tkv042bX_GQAVFiClDCA-Zg">Netwerk24</a></b> reported on Thursday that Whiteley won't feature for the Lions in their 2020 Super Rugby campaign.</p>
      <p>Whiteley, 32, is still struggling with a knee injury which sidelined him for much of 2019.</p>
      <p>"Warren admitted to me he's still experiencing a lot of pain (in his knee). It's a case of him recovering nicely, only to suffer setbacks and he won't be able to play any time soon. The decision was made that he won't be involved as a player for us in Super Rugby next year," Lions chairperson <b>Altmann Allers</b> told the Afrikaans publication.</p>
      <p>Whiteley has been laid low by several injuries over the past two seasons, but it's specifically knee ligament injuries that could mean the end of his playing career.</p>
      <p>It's looking increasingly likely that Whiteley's future lies in coaching, with a role as Lions forwards coach rumoured to be on the cards.</p>
      <p>Whiteley has had a significant impact as Lions skipper over the last few years and the team reached three consecutive Super Rugby finals (2016, 2017 and 2018) under his leadership.</p>
      <p>He has also played in 23 Tests for the Springboks between 2014 and 2018.</p>
      <p>The Lions begin their 2020 Super Rugby campaign away to the Jaguares on Saturday, February 1.</p>
