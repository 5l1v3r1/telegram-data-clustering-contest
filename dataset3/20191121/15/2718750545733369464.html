      <h1>Let Phoebe Waller-Bridge Play Lyra Belacqua, You Cowards!</h1>

      <p>Look, it doesn’t matter that at this point in time there’s a significant age gap between <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2016/09/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-ryan-gosling-feminism.html">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> and the character Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman’s <i>His Dark Materials</i>. If PWB wants to play Lyra, PWB should get to play Lyra! The superfan admitted her obsession with the fantasy novels while discussing her favorite books with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/21/books/review/by-the-book-interview-phoebe-waller-bridge.html">New York <i>Times</i></a>. “The <i>Point Horror</i> books were a feature, Roald Dahl was a champion, but Philip Pullman’s <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy defined me as a young reader,” she said. “I lived between those pages. I remember the physical ache of wanting to be deep in those worlds. I even wrote to Pullman asking if I could play Lyra. Still waiting.” Wow, <i>The Golden Compass </i>(2007) and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/his-dark-materials-hbo-review.html"><i>His Dark Materials</i></a><i> </i>(2019) have left the chat. Both adaptations of the trilogy are starkly missing Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s presence. Still, she managed to carry her obsession for the books into <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/05/fleabag-season-2-fourth-wall-ending.html">her own projects</a>. As <i>His Dark Materials</i> star Lin-Manuel Miranda pointed out, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/07/vulture-tv-awards-2019-the-best-show-on-tv-is-fleabag.html">Fleabag</a> clearly features <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/fleabag-season-2-fox-meaning.html">a daemon</a> in season two.</p>
