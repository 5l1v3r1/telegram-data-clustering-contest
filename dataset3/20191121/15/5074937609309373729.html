      <h1>Three million Ghanaians defecate in the open - WaterAid</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:47:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author">Philip Tengzu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Wa, (U/W), Nov. 20, GNA - About three million Ghanaians, constituting about eleven per cent of the population, still defecate in the open while 13 per cent use unapproved latrines, WaterAid Ghana has said.</p>
      <p>It said data from the Joint Monitoring Platform of the UNICEF and the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that only 18 per cent of Ghanaians have access to improved sanitation, including toilet facilities while about 50 per cent had limited access to such facilities.</p>
      <p>The WaterAid Ghana said this in a statement issued and signed by Madam Yvonne Kafui Nyarko, the Communication and Campaign Officer, and copied to the Ghana News Agency in Wa.</p>
      <p>It was to mark the World Toilet Day which is being held under the theme: "Leaving no one behind".</p>
      <p>The statement called on government to give assemblies across the country the needed resources to train more latrine artisans to ensure that open defecation is totally eradicated.</p>
      <p>It said Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies need adequate resources to enable them effectively monitor Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) interventions to ensure improved sanitation practices at the community level.</p>
      <p>"Open defecation leads to the spread of preventable diseases and threatens the health and wellbeing of people especially children under five years", it said.</p>
      <p>The statement quoted Mr Abdul-Nashiru Mohammed, the Country Director for WaterAid as saying, â€œIt is possible to meet the Global Goal 6 on sanitation ... with commitment and dedication to improving WASH access".</p>
      <p>It said as part of efforts to scale up access to improved toilet facilities at the community level, WaterAid Ghana has trained latrine artisans in the Wa Municipality, Bongo and Kassena Nankana West Districts in the Upper East Region to provide latrine construction services to people in their respective communities using locally available materials such as cow dung and clay.</p>
      <p>The statement said through such interventions, 19 communities in the Bongo and Kassena Nankana West districts have been declared Open Defecation Free (ODF) while others working to attain that status.</p>
      <p>It lauded latrine artisans for their relentless efforts, dedication and commitment in the fight against Open Defecation.</p>
