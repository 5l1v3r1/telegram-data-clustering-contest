        <b>A High Court judge is going to ask UK authorities for more information in relation to their pursuit of an Irishman wanted on manslaughter charges.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eamon Harrison from Mayobridge in Co Down is accused of being part of a human trafficking operation that led to the deaths of 39 Vietnamese people found in a lorry container in Essex.</p>
      <p>On the afternoon of October 23rd, police in Essex found the bodies of 31 men and eight women in a lorry container.</p>
      <p>The driver was arrested at the scene and has since been charged with various offences, including manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Eamon Harrison is suspected of delivering the container to a port in Belgium, from where it was then transported to England.</p>
      <p>He is wanted in the UK on 39 charges of manslaughter, a charge of human trafficking and one charge of conspiring to assist unlawful immigration.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was arrested at Dublin Port on October 26th on foot of a European Arrest Warrant.</p>
      <p>At his extradition hearing today, his barrister Siobhan Stack SC claimed the warrant was defective due to its lack of information and certain ambiguities surrounding what is alleged to have happened - particularly where the deaths occurred and what the allegation in relation to her client's degree of involvement is.</p>
      <p>A dispute over his nationality also needs to be clarified, she said.</p>
      <p>The hearing has been adjourned until December 12th to give the court time to seek more information from UK authorities.</p>
