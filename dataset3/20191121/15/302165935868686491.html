      <p>SUBANG JAYA, Nov 21 — Under-22 national football (B-22) head coach Datuk Ong Kim Swee is faced with a challenging task of naming a 20-player squad for the upcoming SEA Games in the Philippines.</p>
      <p>To date, 32 players remain in the camp, and Kim Swee has less than 24 hours to choose a team that is balanced in every position.</p>
      <p>As such, he is leaning towards players who can play in multiple positions on the field.</p>
      <p>“It is quite challenging for me to name 20 players for the squad. It’s different from the AFC Championship, where 23 players are allowed, so I have to look at the balance and depth in some positions. I have to pick players who can play in two or three positions to give players time to rest based on the schedule in Manila.</p>
      <p>“(Having players who can play in two positions is an advantage and I have to see which positions I need to consider, to get the players required in them,” he said when met after a training session at the Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ) here today.</p>
      <p>During the training session, the U-22 squad recorded 3-0 and 2-0 friendly victories over Northern Territory FC and Western Australia FC, respectively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, commenting on the possibility of US-based player Wan Kuzain Wan Kamal, playing with the national squad, Kim Swee said the matter would only be confirmed by tomorrow.</p>
      <p>According to Kim Swee, there are still issues to be resolved before the 21-year-old who plays for Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City, is eligible to join the squad.</p>
      <p>“There is still no decision on Wan Kuzain, and I can only confirm his situation tomorrow. There are still several issues that need to be resolved by tomorrow, and I hope if things go well, we can list him. Otherwise, we would have to forget Wan Kuzain,” he added.</p>
      <p>Wan Kuzain, who is a US citizen by birth, joined the training camp on Monday. — Bernama</p>
