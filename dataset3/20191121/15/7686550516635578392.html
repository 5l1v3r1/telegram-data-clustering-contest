      <h2>British Transport Police is investigating the series of strange events</h2>

      <p>A Gloucestershire railway station has been hit by an unusual prowler during the course of the last three weeks.</p>
      <p>Between October 30 and November 13, two young women returned to their cars at Yate station to three times find disturbing notes and chocolates had been left on their windscreens during the course of the day.</p>
      <p>According to Birmingham Live, British Transport police are now appealing for witnesses to help them find the author of the six notes which are described as being "of a crude, personal and highly sexual nature."</p>

      <p>On two of the three occasions, lollipops and handfuls of Quality Street chocolates accompanied the notes which the police reported to have caused the girls "understandable amount of concern."</p>
      <p>"Officers are appealing for anyone who may have seen anyone leaving notes or behaving suspiciously in the car park of Yate station during this time period to get in touch with them," their statement said</p>
      <p>"Anyone with information can contact BTP by texting 61016 or calling 0800 40 50 40 quoting reference 655 of 01/11/2019."</p>
