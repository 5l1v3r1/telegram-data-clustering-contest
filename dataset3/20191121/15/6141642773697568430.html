      <p>Israel’s attorney general is set to announce his long-awaited decision on whether to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a series of corruption scandals.</p>
      <p>Avichai Mandelblit’s ruling promises to upend the Israeli political world after two inconclusive elections.</p>
      <p>If, as widely expected, he presses charges against the prime minister, it would deal a heavy blow to Mr Netanyahu’s hopes of remaining in office.</p>
      <p>If Mr Netanyahu is cleared, it would give him a major boost as the country braces for the possibility of its third election in under a year.</p>
