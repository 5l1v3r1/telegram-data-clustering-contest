      <p>New streaming service Quibi hasn't even launched yet but it's already getting a lot of attention owing to its mega shows, including one <i>High School Musical </i>OG Zac Efron. So, the question is, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/zac-efrons-new-show-killing-zac-efron-puts-him-deep-in-the-jungle-63163">how do you watch <i>Killing Zac Efron </i>in the UK?</a> Because this show is just as wild as it sounds.</p>
      <p><i>Killing Zac Efron </i>will follow the Hollywood A-lister as he travels deep into the jungle of a remote island and goes off the grid for 21 days. The brand spanking new adventure show not only stars Efron, but has him in the role of executive producer too.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the new show in a press release sent to Bustle UK, Efron has said:</p>
      <blockquote>"I tend to thrive under extreme circumstances and seek out opportunities that challenge me on every level. I am excited to explore any uncharted territory and discover what unexpected adventure awaits!"</blockquote>
      <p>He'll have only basic gear, a guide partner, and "the will to survive," the press release states. Oh for goodness sake, couldn't he have booked a <i>yurt </i>or something? Glamping this is not.</p>
      <p>As previously mentioned, <i>Killing Zak Efron</i> will be available on <a href="https://www.quibi.com/">Quibi, an upcoming mobile streaming platform</a> set to launch in the u.S. in April 2020. Sadly, there is <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-quibi-be-available-in-the-uk-the-new-streaming-platform-is-adapting-how-to-lose-a-guy-in-10-days-18546107">yet to be a British release date for Quibi</a>, but<i> </i>I have contacted a member of their press team to find out more info about <i>Killing Zac Efron</i> and what their plans are to get it in front of UK audiences.</p>

And Vulture are now reporting that <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/bill-murray-joins-dave-franco-in-quibi-comedy-series-the-now.html">Bill Murray is set to star</a> in <i>The Now</i>, a new show for the network that comes from the mind of Oscar-winning <i>Green Book </i>director Peter Farrelly and his brother Bobby.</p>
