      <h2>Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was snapped looking downcast at Buckingham Palace as he saw his mother Queen Elizabeth for the first time since he was forced to withdraw form public life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:46:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew appeared forlorn as he returned to Buckingham Palace today to see his mother the Queen for the first time since <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-prince-andrew-stepping-down-20924010">she effectively sacked him.</a></p>
      <p>The Duke of York was snapped standing by his £170,000 Bentley Flying Spur sports car in the Palace's courtyard this afternoon.</p>
      <p>It's reported that Andrew was at Her Majesty's London residence to discuss his future after he was forced to step down from public life yesterday amid the fallout from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/prince-andrew-considering-second-interview-20920558">his car-crash BBC interview</a> over his links to paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Pictures published by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7710285/Prince-Andrew-smiling-waving-breaks-cover-time-Queen-sacked-him.html">MailOnline</a> show the Duke appearing solemn as he prepared to discuss losing his £249,000 taxpayer-funded salary.</p>
      <p>He is also expected to discuss the future of his Pitch@Palace project for tech entrepreneurs and start-ups, now it has lost Royal patronage - <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-prince-andrew-steps-down-20930152">and the support of several major backers</a> and partners.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Andrew has stepped down from his role as Chancellor of Huddersfield University, the university has confirmed, after its students' union voted last night to campaign for him to stand down as the ceremonial head.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The University had initially backed the Prince, saying his "enthusiasm for innovation and entrepreneurship is a natural fit with the work of the university."</p>
      <p>But in a statement this afternoon, Huddersfield University Students' Union said: "This morning, we've received confirmation from the university that the duke has stepped down from his position with immediate effect to allow the university to appoint a new chancellor.</p>
      <p>"We know that students will welcome this decision, and the Students' Union would like to offer our sympathy to the victims of Epstein and all those affected by sexual abuse across the world."</p>
      <p>In a statement the university said: "HRH The Duke of York has announced he is stepping back from Royal duties for a period of time.</p>
      <p>"Due to the circumstances and in discussion with the University, he has decided to step down immediately to allow the University to appoint a successor."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-prince-andrew-pictured-first-20927848">Earlier today the 59-year-old Royal was pictured smiling and waving</a> behind the wheel of his car less than 24 hours after he was summoned to Buckingham Palace and forced to step back from public life.</p>
      <p>Andrew, wearing a suit and tie, was snapped leaving his home in Windsor on Thursday morning as the fallout from the Royal Family's unprecedented crisis continued.</p>
      <p>His future role is expected to see him only appear at smaller events with the other members of the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>However the Prince has revealed he plans to continue working with Pitch@Palace, a decision which has been described as "not tenable", by a source close to a sponsor of the initiative.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The source said: "To say you're stepping back from public life but then carry on is not a tenable position by the palace, and I think the sponsor shares that view.</p>
      <p>"We really want the programme to continue and succeed, because it's a valuable programme, but if it's going to continue to have reputational problems then we'll have to walk away from our contract."</p>
      <p>This condemnation was echoed by Graham Smith, of Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state.</p>
      <p>Mr Smith said: "Prince Andrew's decision to step back is more smoke and mirrors to protect the image of the monarchy.</p>
      <p>"It's been reported he will remain patron of many organisations and continue his involvement in Pitch@Palace.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Several years ago Andrew was stripped of his trade ambassador title, but then continued to fly around the world representing this country.</p>
      <p>"The palace needs to clarify exactly what they mean by him stepping back and explain why he isn't stepping down.</p>
      <p>"Otherwise, this just looks like more spin to cover royal backs than real accountability.</p>
      <p>"This whole episode shows why the monarchy is not fit for purpose. Andrew is the worst example of a long tradition of bad behaviour. We need a democratic alternative to the monarchy sooner rather than later."</p>
      <p>Andrew will work on the Pitch@Palaceproject privately without the support of Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: "He will continue to work on Pitch but will look at how to do that outside and entirely separate from the palace."</p>
      <p>It is thought the duke will not have any involvement with the dozens of charities, organisations and military units he is associated with and that have been deserting him since the public outcry over his interview with BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>Viewers were displeased with his responses to the questions put to him where he failed to show remorse for Epstein's victims and said he did not regret the friendship because of "‘the opportunities I was given to learn" from him about trade and business.</p>
      <p>Asked if the Duke of York was right to step back from public life, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters on a visit to Bedfordshire this afternoon: "All I can say is that it is very important that all the victims of Jeffrey Epstein get justice and the law must be done and must be seen to be done."</p>

      <p>The scandal-hit prince is facing criticism and calls to co-operate with the FBI.</p>
      <p>American lawyers representing Epstein's alleged victims have blasted the Duke over his latest statement and hinted that the Queen's son could be subpoenaed to force him to answer questions under oath.</p>
      <p>Solicitor Lisa Bloom said she had "the right" to seek a statement from individuals she deemed to have "relevant information".</p>
      <p>She told BBC Breakfast: "It's not going to be easy to subpoena someone like Prince Andrew, he's obviously not walking down the street where a process server can just hand him a piece of paper, it's a lot more complicated.</p>
      <p>"If he refused to come, we may have a diplomatic situation between (the UK) and (the US). I hope it doesn't come to that.</p>
      <p>"I take him at his word that he says he is going to co-operate, and I hope that's what's going to happen."</p>

      <p>Asked if an FBI investigation into Epstein could reach to the UK, Ms Bloom said: "It certainly could and it should."</p>
      <p>Her comments come in response to the Duke saying in a statement that he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required".</p>
      <p>Andrew is preparing to give formal evidence to the US criminal investigation into disgraced financier and paedophile Epstein, the Telegraph reported.</p>
      <p>British police have been urged to reopen their investigation into allegations involving Epstein.</p>
      <p>The report emerged along with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inside-queens-sacking-prince-andrew-20926614">new details about what went on behind the scenes</a> before the Queen's second oldest son was forced to step back from royal life four days after the disastrous BBC interview.</p>
      <p>Following Saturday night's interview, Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's alleged victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the pervert, who killed himself in a New York prison while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>

      <p>Andrew has repeatedly denied claims that he had sex with Epstein accuser Victoria Giuffre (nee Roberts) on three occasions when she was a teen.</p>
      <p>Mrs Giuffre, now 36 and living in Australia, claims she was groomed and forced to have sex with Epstein and his friends.</p>
      <p>Andrew claims an alleged encounter in 2001 did not happen, as he spent the day with his daughter, Princess Beatrice, taking her to Pizza Express in Woking for a party.</p>
      <p>The Duke said he had no recollection of meeting Mrs Giuffre.</p>

      <p>It has emerged that the Queen, 93, summoned Andrew - said to be her favourite son - to Buckingham Palace in central London from his home, the Grade II-listed Royal Lodge, on Wednesday as the scandal deepened.</p>
      <p>She had held crisis talks with future king Prince Charles, 71, who is said to have lobbied for his younger brother to be removed.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Wales, who is on a tour of New Zealand with wife Camilla, reportedly spoke to Andrew by telephone.</p>
      <p>At Buckingham Palace, Andrew issued a grovelling apology to his mum - on her 72nd wedding anniversary with husband Prince Philip - as she forced him to step down.</p>
      <p>The monarch - reported to be "disappointed" and "unhappy" following the BBC interview - then informed the wider Royal Family before the palace issued a bombshell statement on behalf of the scandal-hit prince.</p>

      <p>A source told the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-quits-public-life-prepares-give-evidence-epstein/">Telegraph</a> it was the Queen's decision to force Andrew to step back from public life, adding: "The Duke was summoned from his home, Royal Lodge Windsor, to see the Queen personally at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>"Effectively he was told to bow out gracefully.</p>
      <p>"They agreed he could release a statement saying it was his decision but it was the Queen who told him to do it."</p>
      <p>The Queen is said to have given Andrew approval for the interview before he sat down with journalist Emily Maitlis at Buckingham Palace on November 14.</p>
      <p>A senior Palace source confirmed to the Mirror that the Duke had vowed to “not return to public life until the Epstein case is closed or he has cleared his name”.</p>
      <p>The palace insider said “that could be a considerable amount of time”.</p>

      <p>The reality means he will have to rely on handouts from his mum from her Duchy of Lancaster money, which made £21million in profits last year.</p>
      <p>Senior palace aides told humiliated Andrew the furore over his Newsnight appearance and shameful excuses for staying at Epstein’s house were damaging the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Before he was forced to step back, the Duke had reportedly planned to fly to Bahrain this Saturday for a Pitch@Palace charity event despite the crisis.</p>
      <p>It is reported that Andrew will still be seen with other senior royals on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on big occasions such as Trooping the Colour.</p>
      <p>The future of Andrew’s private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, is also in the balance after reports she helped convince Andrew to do the interview.</p>
      <p>A cloud of uncertainty also now hangs over Andrew’s eldest daughter Beatrice’s wedding next year.</p>
