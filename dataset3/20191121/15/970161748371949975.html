      <p>The new owner of collapsed travel company Thomas Cook is on a major recruitment drive after already offering permanent contracts to all former employees.</p>
      <p>Hays Travel, the UK’s largest independent travel firm, has created 1,500 jobs and apprenticeships, signalling a vote of confidence in the future of the package holiday industry.</p>
      <p>The nationwide search for staff includes 200 posts at their head office in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sunderland-fc/">Sunderland</a>, and a further 500 jobs handling foreign currency at stores across the UK.</p>
      <p>The company, which snapped up Thomas Cook when it went into administration last month, is also recruiting an apprentice at each of its 737 branches.</p>
      <p>Joint owners John and Irene Hays have so far employed and offered permanent contracts to 2,330 former Thomas Cook workers.</p>

      <p>Mr Hayes said: ‘We’re further increasing staffing to ensure we have the highest customer service levels across all of our stores and our head office functions.</p>

      <p>‘These are fantastic permanent career opportunities for people who want to take a step into an exciting industry where every day is different.</p>
      <p>‘You don’t necessarily need travel experience – just an enthusiasm for travel, a good head for numbers for the foreign exchange posts and some customer service experience of any kind would be helpful.’</p>
      <p>Hayes opened 450 stores within six weeks of saving Thomas Cook.</p>
      <p>Their Travel Academy is offering training for people with no experience in the industry and say some successful candidates could start their new job before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Apprentices will undergo two years of training through an accredited apprenticeship scheme.</p>

      <p>The first Hayes stores opened 40 years ago in Sunderland, but the business rapidly spread to become the country’s largest independent travel firm.</p>
      <p>The company now has 737 travel shops and employees 4,200 people on permanent contracts.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Thomas Cook’s high profile collapse, Ryanair boss Micheal O’Leary said the package holiday industry was ‘screwed’.</p>
      <p>But defending their recruitment drive, Managing Director Mr Hayes suggested corporate culture was to blame for the UK’s oldest travel company going bankrupt.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘They [staff]  will have the same empowerment and trust that we give all of our colleagues.</p>
      <p>‘The former Thomas Cook managers have said the biggest difference for them is being empowered and valued – as an independent travel agent they are not tied to certain products or scripts and they feel trusted.</p>

      <p>‘This is a key principle of our business.’</p>
