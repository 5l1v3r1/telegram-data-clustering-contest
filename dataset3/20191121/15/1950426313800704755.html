        <b>The tech giant’s CEO visited DC at the time to testify before Congress about Facebook’s plans to launch its own cryptocurrency, Libra.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During his testimony, a congresswoman proposed that Zuckerberg help Congress create a legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the US – an offer that he didn’t accept.</p>
      <p>Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg had a meeting at the White House in October, hosted by the US president and the first lady, Donald and Melania Trump, which was not officially announced, NBC News reported.</p>

      <p>The meeting was also attended by Peter Thiel, a billionaire and Facebook board member, according to the report.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg’s presence at the meeting was confirmed by Facebook, but the exact topics that were discussed at the meeting remain unknown.</p>
      <p>“As is normal for a CEO of a major US company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,” a Facebook spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>Around the time of the “secret” meeting, the Facebook CEO visited Washington to testify before Congress in relation to his company’s ambition to issue its own Libra cryptocurrency.</p>

      <p>In his testimony, Zuckerberg assured that he would seek approval from the Federal Reserve before issuing it.</p>
      <p>During the testimony, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez also suggested that Zuckerberg help the government to develop a legal framework for cryptocurrencies in the US.</p>
      <p>The Facebook CEO, however, was reluctant to accept the offer, noting that it would “seem appropriate” if Congress exercised oversight over regulators through its committees.</p>
