      <p>Last month <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-remote-play-together-beta-available/">Valve began beta testing for Steam Remote Play Together</a>, a new feature which lets you play all your local multiplayer games online with friends. It’s kind of a brilliant idea, and now Remote Play is available to all Steam users! Valve released a new trailer to celebrate the feature’s full launch, which you can check out below.</p>

      <p>Some of the titles listed above are some of the most fun I’ve had in the last few years, so definitely don’t sleep on ‘em! I particularly recommend Overcooked, Tower Fall Ascension, River City Girls, and both Guacamelee games. Now that you don’t need friends in the same room to play them, you’ve got no excuses.</p>
