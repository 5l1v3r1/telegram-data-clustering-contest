      <p>President Trump’s 2020 election campaign is lashing out at Facebook over fears that the social network may change its ad targeting options.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamTrump/status/1197217636662337536">the official Twitter account for Team Trump slammed the Silicon Valley social networking firm</a>, warning that theoretical changes will “raise prices to put more of your hard earned small dollar donations into their pockets.”</p>
      <p>The attack comes amid bitter and ongoing debate over Facebook’s policies on political ads. The company has been criticised for allowing politicians to lie in ads – a position it has defended on free speech grounds. And some critics, including a group of current Facebook employees, have called on the company to make changes to how political ads can be targeted in an attempt to rein in their impact.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, top Facebook advertising exec <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1196545155244810240">Carolyn Everson said that it wouldn’t make changes to political ad targeting mechanisms</a>, saying “that’s not on the table.” But she subsequently rowed that back, <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1196599250991210496">with Axios reporter Sara Fisher tweeting that</a> “she says the company is still considering a number of options and nothing is off the table.”</p>
      <p>Thus far, Facebook has given no indication of what – if anything – it might change about its political advertising tools, or given a timetable for any such changes.</p>
      <p>But Trump’s campaign has presented the company’s comments as statements of intent to make changes that would damage its ability to campaign.</p>
      <p>In a tweet that begins “IMPORTANT” on Wednesday, the Team Trump account wrote that “@Facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans &amp; lift voices the media and big tech choose to ignore!”</p>

      <p>A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately provide comment on Facebook’s current intentions around political advertising.</p>
      <p>The Trump campaign’s purported warning is the latest attack from a 2020 presidential hopeful, who have found big tech an easy candidate for criticism and for firing up their base. Trump and other American right-wing figures have repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that tech companies are trying to censor conservative voices online.</p>
      <p>And on the left, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elizabeth-warren-mark-zuckerberg-breaking-up-facebook-2019-10">Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) is part of a growing chorus calling</a> for antitrust action to be taken against Facebook and other tech firms.</p>
