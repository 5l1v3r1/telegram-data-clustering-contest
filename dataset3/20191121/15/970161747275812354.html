        <b>Judd Trump might be one of the most naturally talented <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/snooker/">snooker</a> players in history, but it is his single-mindedness and commitment to his game that separates him from the pack, believes Michael Holt.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 30-year-old is riding high at the top of the sport as the world champion and world number one, showing no signs of slowing down.</p>
      <p>After claiming his first world title in May, the Bristolian has triumphed in three more ranking events, most recently beating Ronnie O’Sullivan in the final of the Northern Ireland Open.</p>
      <p>13 years ago, Trump became the youngest player to qualify for the final stages of a ranking event at the Welsh Open, so the snooker world has long been aware of him, but it has only been over the last year that he has reached the pinnacle of the sport.</p>

      <p>Holt believes that his natural talent got him so far, but the mental toughness he has developed has taken him to the very highest level.</p>
      <p>‘I’m a big fan of Trump, I just love his attitude, he’s brilliant, such a great player,’ Holt told <b>Metro.co.uk</b>.</p>
      <p>‘He’s turned into a great player, he obviously had raw talent when he was a kid. It’s his second spell at number one and what is he, 12? It’s incredible really, he’s won everything now.</p>
      <p>‘What he did to [John] Higgins in the [World Championship] final. I admire his stubbornness and belief in his own ability, because he got a bit of stick a few months ago which I thought was incredible.</p>

      <p>‘Some people would have took that criticism badly and start doubting his technique and start tinkering, because he’s got a strange technique going across the white.</p>
      <p>‘But he didn’t, he believed in what he does, worked hard and look at him now. His attitude and resilience, that’s what champions have got and he’s got it in spades.</p>
      <p>‘As far as dominating, it’s hard to dominate now, there’s a lot of good players around and some days you’re going to get beat. But the way he’s playing now, you never know, somebody’s going to have to play well to beat him because he’s not throwing any bad matches in.</p>

      <p>‘With his action, it’s so amazing. A lot of world champions have a bad season the next year because they’re away with the fairies, but he’s said “that’s not going to be me” he’s got his head down. Great attitude, we can all learn from his mentality.’</p>

      <p>Trump hammered Higgins 18-9 in one of the most impressive performances in World Championship history, but it could all have been very different for the Juddernaut.</p>
      <p>The world number one barely scraped past Thepchaiya Un-Nooh in round one, with the Thai star narrowly running out of position during a break in the deciding frame, and Holt knows how different Trump’s life could be if those few seconds had played out differently.</p>
      <p>‘He was one ball away from losing first match to Thepchaiya, who was so unlucky,’ continued the Hitman. ‘He came through the pack and it could have landed almost anywhere and it ended in the absolute worst spot.</p>
      <p>‘He left Judd a double and he knocked in a mad double. But Thepchaiya was a roll of the white away from knocking him out and then he wasn’t world champion and we’d all have been talking about him losing first match.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone would be questioning if he can achieve what he should in the game. That’s all it takes, such fine margins between everyone saying how great he is now, the same people would be jumping on the bandwagon saying he hasn’t achieved enough, he doesn’t live right, he goes out too much, all this absolute codswallop.</p>

      <p>‘But it did roll an extra one and all them people have disappeared into their hole again.’</p>
      <p>Much has been made of Trump curbing his former ‘playboy lifestyle’ of clubbing and sports cars, and now being fully focused on the game he has profited.</p>
      <p>The world champ still enjoys himself, as his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/judd147t/">Instragram</a> detailed over the summer, and Holt believes as long as he’s working hard and playing hard, then all is well, especially with the results speaking for themselves.</p>
      <p>‘He works hard at his game, I think he does everything right,’ said the world number 37. ‘You’ve got to enjoy your life and if he likes going out to clubs, popping champagne bottles, it’s not for me, but if that’s what rocks his boat then crack on mate.</p>
      <p>‘On his death bed he’ll regret the things he didn’t do, good look to the man.</p>
      <p>‘There’s plenty of jealousy as well, which creates criticism, but he’s not hurting anyone. They’re the same people who say there’s no characters in the game and the same people who ask him for a photo.</p>
      <p>‘He’s world number one and world champion so you can’t criticise him.’</p>
      <p>Holt and Trump will be in action at the UK Championship next week, where the Hitman takes on Adam Stefanow in round one and the Juddernaut faces Amine Amiri.</p>
