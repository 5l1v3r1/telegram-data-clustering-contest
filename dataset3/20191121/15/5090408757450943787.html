They’re the first brand new Pokémon games for the Nintendo Switch, and they’re already among the best-selling Switch games of all time one week after release.</p>
      <p>“Pokémon Sword and Shield” are selling faster than last year’s “Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!” and “Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!,” which <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20181128005283/en/Nintendo-Hits-Big-Milestones-Thanksgiving-Cyber-Monday">sold about 1.5 million copies in their first two weeks</a>. “Let’s Go, Pikachu!” and Let’s Go, Eevee” were remakes of the original 1996 games, “Pokémon Red” and “Pokémon Blue.”</p>
      <p>The Pokémon Company says the core Pokémon games have sold more than 240 million copies worldwide, not including spin-offs like “Pokémon Detective Pikachu” and “Pokémon Mystery Dungeon.” As the 8th generation of Pokémon games, “Sword” and “Shield” bring the total number of Pokémon to nearly 1,000, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/dexit-pokemon-sword-shield-controversy-nintendo-switch-2019-7">though not all of the Pokémon can be caught in the latest games.</a></p>
