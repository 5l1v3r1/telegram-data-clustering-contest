      <p><i>Following five solid seasons with the Pirates in which he was an All-Star and finished fourth in NL Cy Young Award voting in 2015,</i> Gerrit Cole<i>reached an elite level over two seasons with the Astros. He is tied to Draft-pick compensation if he signs with a new team after being one of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/2020-qualifying-offer-decisions">10 players to receive the $17.8 million qualifying offer</a>.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>Below is a list of the latest news and rumors surrounding the 29-year-old right-hander, who is now a free agent.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Teixeira predicts Cole won't end up in New York</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 21:</i> Appearing on ESPN's <a href="http://www.espn.com/espnradio/play?id=28116777">"Baseball Tonight" podcast</a> with Buster Olney, former MLB first baseman and current ESPN analyst Mark Teixeira offered a glimpse at Yankees general manager Brian Cashman's approach to free agency and also made a prediction on whether New York will land Cole.</p>
      <p>Teixeira played the final eight seasons of his 14-year Major League career with the Yankees after signing an eight-year, $180 million contract with the club in January 2009. Teixeira said when discussions first began in mid-November of 2008, Cashman didn't extend an offer. Rather, Cashman told agent Scott Boras to call when he was ready to make a decision. Teixeira thinks Cashman could take the same approach this offseason with Cole, who is also represented by Boras.</p>
      <p>“Every agent knows that if they don’t call the Yankees before their client signs they might be leaving money on the table,” Teixeira said. “Because, especially this year, with how important Gerrit Cole is to the Yankees offseason, they won’t get outbid.</p>
      <p>“The question is, if the Yankees truly want Gerrit Cole, they can give him 10 years and $400 million dollars, they can do that. The question is, what are other teams willing to do and the Yankees don’t want to bid against themselves during this process.”</p>
      <p>However, Teixeira said his gut feeling is that Cole won't end up with the Yankees.</p>
      <p>"Playing in New York is not for everybody," Teixeira said. "And maybe Gerrit Cole will thrive in New York. But if you told me, as the top free agent on the market, and I’m a West Coast guy, and the Dodgers and Angels are sitting there drooling over me. I’m probably going to look there before I look at the Yankees.</p>
      <p>“The question is, if the Yankees did something crazy and got to $350 million or $400 million dollars, then you almost can’t turn it down, right? I think money being equal, he’s not going to the Yankees. If the Yankees completely blow everyone out of the water, then he’ll end up in pinstripes.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Could Angels sign both Cole and Wheeler?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 20:</i> The Angels are considered one of the frontrunners to sign Cole for a number of obvious reasons. The right-hander is from Orange County, Calif., the team needs an ace and wants to contend as soon as 2020, and owner Arte Moreno has never shied away from spending money. <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-free-agency-perfect-fits">MLB.com's Richard Justice</a> takes it one step further, writing that the Angels and Cole are "as close to perfect as a free-agent marriage can get."</p>
      <p>However, it doesn't seem as though Los Angeles plans to put all its eggs in the Cole basket. Agent Scott Boras is known to be patient with his top clients, allowing the market to fully develop. Last offseason, Bryce Harper, another Boras client, didn't sign with the Phillies until March.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/latest-on-wheeler-gray-more">MLB.com's Jon Paul Morosi</a>, the Angels are one of four teams leading the race to sign another top free-agent starting pitcher, Zack Wheeler, along with the Padres, White Sox and Twins. Morosi speculates that Wheeler, one of the only high-end players in this year's free-agent class not represented by Boras, will sign long before Cole, and possibly even before Stephen Strasburg.</p>
      <p>That makes one wonder: If the Angels land Wheeler, would that prevent them from signing Cole?</p>
      <p>Without being too specific, Angels general manager Billy Eppler revealed at the GM Meetings that he would like to add two starting pitchers this offseason, according to the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2019/11/11/angels-pondering-rotation-configuration-around-shohei-ohtani/">Orange County Register</a>.</p>
      <p>Back in October, Moreno promised a <a href="https://twitter.com/BillShaikin/status/1187463777056251904">payroll increase</a> in 2020. And Eppler said the Angels "have the ability to be aggressive if we want to," referring to the team's financial situation. But it's possible the Angels' need for more than one starter could steer the club away from Cole. Los Angeles already has roughly $115 million committed to just five players in 2020, and $88.5 million committed to three players in 2021, after which Albert Pujols' deal will come off the books.</p>
      <p>Morosi thinks a five-year, $100 million deal for Wheeler is plausible, which means Cole and Wheeler could cost north of $50 million a year combined.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Should Dodgers pursue Cole over Rendon?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 19:</i> MLB Network insider Jon Heyman <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/dodgers-vying-for-rendon">reported last week</a> that Anthony Rendon is on the Dodgers' radar, but fellow MLB Network insider Joel Sherman thinks Los Angeles would be better off going after one of the other top free agents on the market.</p>
      <p>"The first thing I would do is, I would seriously pursue Gerrit Cole," Sherman said Monday on MLB Network's <a href="https://www.mlb.com/video/sherman-plays-dodgers-gm-for-day">"Hot Stove"</a> program as he played the role of the Dodgers' general manager. "I want to get to the point where Cole and Walker Buehler are my No. 1 and 2 starters, and I begin to de-emphasize Clayton Kershaw, who's still a very good Major League starter. But it gets to the postseason every year and they're somehow beholden to Clayton Kershaw, who even himself, after [National League Division Series] Game 5 when they were eliminated against Washington, talked about his history in the postseason, which is, at best, mixed."</p>
      <p>Kershaw is one of the greatest regular-season pitchers in MLB history, recording a lifetime 2.44 ERA and winning three NL Cy Young Awards as well as the 2014 NL MVP Award. He has remained effective over the past few years even as his velocity has begun to slip. Kershaw, though, owns a career 4.43 ERA over 32 playoff appearances (25 starts), and his postseason struggles are perhaps the biggest reason why the Dodgers haven't been able to capture a World Series title despite winning seven consecutive NL West crowns and a pair of NL pennants, as Sherman noted.</p>
      <p>Justin Turner has said he is willing to change positions if the team acquires another third baseman, but with the veteran signed for one more season, the Dodgers' arguably have a greater need for Cole than Rendon.</p>
      <p>Rendon, though, might fit better within the front office's philosophy. The club has avoided giving out long-term contracts to free agents during president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman's tenure. Between Cole and Rendon, the latter is thought to be more open to a shorter-term contract with a higher average annual value like the deal Los Angeles reportedly offered Bryce Harper (four years, $180 million) before he joined the Phillies for $330 million over 13 years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole a West Coast guy, but might Yanks swoop in and woo him to the Bronx?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 15:</i> The Angels have been the club most mentioned when it comes to Cole's free agency, given that the right-hander is from Southern California and was drafted out of UCLA. But as MLB.com's Richard Justice points out while making some bold predictions on how offseason dominoes might start falling, the Yankees don't often lose when they really want a player on the open market. And a player like Cole -- in the prime of his career and at the height of his dominance -- doesn't wind up on the open market all that often.</p>
      <p>"While the consensus in the industry is that Cole will end up with the Angels, the Yankees were always going to be serious bidders," Justice writes. "To state the obvious, they do not finish second in free-agent pursuits very often. This signing [would rattle] both the free-agent and trade markets, especially for the Angels, who envisioned Cole being their crown jewel acquisition." <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-offseason-potential-scenarios">More &gt;</a></p>

        <b>Ranking the top suitors for Cole</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 14:</i> Cole would make every team better -- a lot better. Only one club can land the superstar right-hander, though, which is why Will Leitch introduced MLB.com's <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/gerrit-cole-likely-landing-spots">Gerrit Cole Suitor Power Rankings</a>, breaking down the top five squads leading the chase for the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>At the tippy top? The Dodgers, who "have spent the last few years being smart and prudent and efficient with their spending, bringing in strategically selected free agents, promoting top prospects and re-signing their old players," as Leitch wrote. "They haven’t made that massive free-agent splash. But it’s one thing to lose two straight World Series. It’s another thing to fall out in the National League Division Series."</p>
      <p>Throw in the fact that Cole is a native of Southern California, and well, Los Angeles makes a lot of sense all the way around. Plus, just imagine a rotation fronted by Cole, fellow hard-throwing righty Walker Buehler and star southpaw Clayton Kershaw.</p>
      <p>The other four clubs in the main mix: the Phillies, who could look to spend big again this offseason, this time to fix their rotation; the Rangers, who could be something of a surprise suitor in these sweepstakes; the Angels, the other LA team that already has been linked aplenty to Cole and badly needs pitching; and the Yankees, who have been after Cole ever since they drafted him out of high school in the first round in 2008 but failed to sign him away from UCLA.</p>
      <p>Find out the exact order of those four squads -- and a few other teams that could enter the fray -- in the Cole Suitor Power Rankings <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/gerrit-cole-likely-landing-spots">here</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole finishes as runner-up for AL Cy</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 13:</i> Wednesday was as good a time as any to revisit Cole's dominant walk year. The AL Cy Young Award results were announced, with Cole finishing second in an extremely close race with teammate Justin Verlander.</p>
      <p>Cole and Verlander received every first- and second-place vote. Cole got 13 first-place votes and 17 second-place votes; Verlander got 17 first-place votes and 13 second-place votes. No other AL pitcher got a top-two vote.</p>
      <p>Just a reminder of Cole's 2019 stats: a 20-5 record, an AL-leading 2.50 ERA and a Major League-leading 326 strikeouts -- the highest single-season total since Randy Johnson's 334 in 2002.</p>
      <p>What does that mean for Cole's free agency? Well, as agent Scott Boras put it Wednesday at the GM Meetings, "If this were Major League Christmas, we would be looking at 30 stockings that would clearly want a lump of Cole."</p>
      <p>
        <b>When will Cole sign?</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 13:</i> Agent Scott Boras has never been one to rush the free-agent process for his top clients, and it appears to be business as usual when it comes to Cole, according to <a href="https://www.sny.tv/yankees/news/sources-yankees-free-agent-target-gerrit-cole-expected-to-sign-after-new-year-strasburg-rendon-could-sign-sooner/311777014">SNY's Andy Martino</a>.</p>
      <p>Industry sources told Martino that Boras has indicated to interested teams that Cole is unlikely to sign before January.</p>
      <p>But Boras said Wednesday at the GM Meetings that reports that Cole won't sign until the new year aren't accurate.</p>
      <p>Last offseason, Boras negotiated a 13-year, $330 million contract for Bryce Harper with the Phillies after Spring Training had already begun. Harper's contract also came after the other elite player in last year's free-agent class, Manny Machado, had landed a 10-year, $300 million deal with the Padres.</p>
      <p>Boras represents many of this year's big-name free agents, including Cole, Stephen Strasburg, Anthony Rendon, Hyun-Jin Ryu and Dallas Keuchel, which could give him even more influence than usual over the pace of the market. That said, Martino has heard the markets for Strasburg and Rendon could move faster than expected.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Yankees not hiding interest in Cole</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> Yankees general manager Brian Cashman put it simply at the GM Meetings on Monday. New York is interested in Cole, the top free-agent starter on the market.</p>

      <p>"We'll talk to Cole," Cashman said, when asked about Cole and fellow free-agent ace Stephen Strasburg. "Anybody would have interest in players like that."</p>

      <p>The Yankees would have to win Cole away from his Southern California roots -- teams like the Angels that are reportedly interested -- but they'll try.</p>

        <b>Cole, Strasburg may not fit in San Diego</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 12:</i> As soon as Stephen Strasburg <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/stephen-strasburg-opts-out-of-contract">opted out of the remaining four years of his contract</a> with the Nationals, many speculated the World Series MVP possibly could find his way back to his hometown of San Diego. But how likely is that to happen?</p>
      <p>While the Padres are intent on landing a starting pitcher or two this offseason, they <a href="https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sports/padres/story/2019-11-12/padres-stephen-strasburg-gerrit-cole-free-agency-trades-gm-meetings">may not have the budget</a> to pony up what it will take to secure Strasburg or Cole, according to Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune.</p>
      <p>On one hand, that might seem surprising because the Padres have spent big the past two offseasons, handing out $300 million to third baseman Manny Machado last year and $144 million to first baseman Eric Hosmer in February 2018. On the other hand, though, those very contracts could be precisely why San Diego may not be able to fit Strasburg, who attended San Diego State University before going first overall in the 2009 Draft, into the payroll this time around.</p>
      <p>Given those financial restraints, Acee suggests it may be more likely that the Padres target a free agent like Zack Wheeler, who won't command as hefty of a contract as Strasburg or Cole, the latter of whom is expected to score a record contract for a pitch.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, GM A.J. Preller could look to the trade market to add an arm, as the club's Minor League system is as deep and talented as any in the sport, so he has the chips to go that route.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cole reportedly atop Phillies' wish list</b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Nov. 10:</i> Although the Phillies were among the busiest teams in the Majors when it came to improving their roster last offseason, they did not address their rotation, opting instead to head into 2019 with Aaron Nola, Jake Arrieta, Nick Pivetta, Zach Eflin and Vince Velasquez as their starting five. But Philadelphia's priorities have changed after an 81-81 season in which the team ranked 11th in the National League in rotation ERA (4.64).</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/phillies/phillies-general-manager-meetings-gerrit-cole-scott-boras-20191110.html">Matt Breen of the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, Phillies general manager Matt Klentak is heading to the GM Meetings, which begin Monday, with an offseason plan that centers around pitching. While Cole is at the top of the Phils' wish list, the team could look to add multiple free-agent starters, Breen writes.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://94wip.radio.com/phillies-gm-matt-klentak-wip">radio appearance on 94 WIP</a> in Philadelphia on Thursday, Klentak stressed the importance of not losing Draft picks after the team did so when it signed three players (Carlos Santana, Jake Arrieta, Bryce Harper) who rejected the qualifying offer in the past two offseasons.</p>
      <p>"One of the things we have to try to do, if we can, is to not forfeit Draft picks, and that's hard when you're fishing in the deep end of the free-agent pond," Klentak said. "But we lost our second-round pick last year and our second and third the year before. That doesn't sound like a lot, but that's where Scott Kingery comes from, that's where Spencer Howard comes from, that's where Connor Seabold comes from. That's where some good players come from."</p>
      <p>The problem for Philadelphia is that five of the top free-agent starters -- Cole, Stephen Strasburg, Zack Wheeler, Madison Bumgarner, Jake Odorizzi -- received a QO this year, which means the club's options could be limited if it indeed wants to avoid giving up another pick.</p>
      <p>Notable starters who didn't get a QO include Hyun-Jin Ryu, Dallas Keuchel and former Phillies ace Cole Hamels. Hamels has <a href="https://www.mlb.com/phillies/news/cole-hamels-open-to-return-to-phillies">expressed interest in returning</a> to the city where he spent the first 10 years of his career and won a World Series title. The veteran left-hander also said he is willing to sign a one-year deal to join a contender.</p>
      <p>While Klentak's comments may signal a hesitancy to pursue one of the QO pitchers, it's possible that Cole is the exception.</p>
      <p>Earlier this offseason, <a href="https://theathletic.com/1332419/2019/10/29/who-will-pitch-for-joe-girardis-phillies-club-will-plot-two-offseason-scenarios-with-and-without-gerrit-cole/">Matt Gelb of The Athletic (subscription required)</a> reported that the Phillies were planning to pursue Cole and were going to "plot two scenarios for this winter -- one with Cole and one without him."</p>
