      <p>After going through the summer as a free agent McEachran signed a two-year deal last month and has made just one first team appearance so far.</p>

      <p>“He did the test and he did very well,” Clotet said. “Actually better than expected. I had a good talk with him.</p>
      <p>“He’s putting in all the effort that he can to make sure he’s ready, so that’s good. We have a lot of games now from now until Christmas so everyone will make a difference.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“It was a long time since he last played regularly. I see him very focused on using this opportunity to get back as strong as possible and he’s putting in the right steps in the right direction.”</p>
      <p>Another central midfielder doing that is Gary Gardner, who has not played for five weeks since injuring his knee at Leeds.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Clotet hopes to have Gardner back in the main squad by next week.</p>
      <p>“Gary is already working outside on the pitch with the group. Then in the main part of the session he is working with the medical staff.</p>
      <p>“We expect him to be back with us next week for normal training and then it’s about how he feels.</p>
      <p>“I do know that he’s been quicker and he feels much better than we expected. I hope we can get him back to fitness as quick as possible and he can be in contention again.”</p>
