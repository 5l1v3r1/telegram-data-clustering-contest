      <p>The bar at Torquay United Football Club’s ground will see a different set of supporters than usual on Thursday, December 12.</p>
      <p>The Boots and Laces Sports Bar at Marnham Road in Plainmoor will become one of the 48 polling stations across Torquay and Paignton for the 2019 General Election.</p>
      <p>The stations in the Torbay constituency include churches, cafes, community centres and two Torquay schools - Sherwell Valley Primary in Hawkins Avenue, and Torre CofE Academy in Barton Road.</p>
      <p>The more unusual locations include the unused council-owned building known as The Old Monastery in Berry Drive, Paignton.</p>
      <p>Polling stations will be open for people to cast their votes from 7am to 10pm.</p>
      <p>The deadline to register to vote in the election is at midnight on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>Anyone who is unable to get to a polling station can ask for a postal vote. The deadline to apply, amend or cancel a postal vote is 5pm on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
      <p>Voters can also appoint someone to vote on their behalf, called a proxy vote, for example if they are ill or away on polling day. </p>
      <p>The deadline to apply for a proxy vote is 5pm on Wednesday, December 4.</p>
      <p>In some circumstances people can apply for an emergency proxy vote up to 5pm on polling day. </p>
      <p>More information about voting is on Torbay Council’s website, with links to register and apply for postal and proxy votes online.</p>
      <p>Five candidates are standing to become the MP for Torbay at the General Election.</p>
      <p>They are Independent James Channer, Conservative Kevin Foster, Liberal Democrat Lee Howgate, Labour’s Michele Middleditch and Sam Moss for the Green Party.</p>
