      <h1>Emre Can admits he is considering quitting Juventus amid Man Utd transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>The former Liverpool midfielder has found himself in limbo in Turin this season having been omitted from the club's Champions League squad</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:53:31+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:53</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool midfielder Emre Can admits he's "trying to change" things about his situation at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> amid reported interest from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Germany international Can joined Juve on a free transfer in the summer of 2018, but he's found himself on the fringes of things since the arrival of former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss Maurizio Sarri this summer.</p>
      <p>Can has made just four appearances in Serie A this season, and was left out of Juve's squad for the Champions League group stages.</p>
      <p>Having left <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> under something of a cloud following the expiration of his Reds contract, a return to the Premier League at United has been mooted, although the 25-year-old remained tight-lipped over that possibility when speaking after Germany's 6-1 win over Northern Ireland on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>"I'm still a Juventus player," he told Corriere dello Sport, via the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7710787/The-situation-change-Emre-considering-Juventus-future.html">Mail Online</a> .</p>
      <p>"Obviously I'm not satisfied with my situation, but I'm keeping my foot on the accelerator and I give 100 per cent in every training session.</p>
      <p>"I'm trying to change my situation, no player is happy when they don't play.</p>

      <p>"That's my situation in Turin right now and I'll have to think about what makes the most sense to me over the winter.</p>
      <p>"I certainly see myself staying in Turin, but the situation must change."</p>
      <p>Can was something of a regular in Max Allegri's team in his first season at Juventus, playing 37 times and scoring four goals.</p>

      <p>However he has barely featured under Sarri, who oversaw the arrivals of free transfer midfielders Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot in the summer.</p>
      <p>Prior to joining Juve, Can had played 166 games for Liverpool and scored 14 goals, while he was part of the Reds sides that lost the Europa League and League Cup finals in 2016 and the Champions League final in 2018.</p>
