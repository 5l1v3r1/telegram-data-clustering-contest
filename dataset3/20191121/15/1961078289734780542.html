      <h1>Pence Is Implicated</h1>

      <p>The president led a conspiracy to use American foreign policy for his personal benefit. We’ve known that much for weeks. Yesterday, we heard a credible accusation that the vice president, among other top officials, was aware of the conspiracy and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/us/politics/sondland-says-he-followed-trumps-orders-to-pressure-ukraine.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Homepage">evidently</a> did nothing to stop it.</p>
      <p>Imagine for a moment that congressional Republicans were willing to make good on the oath they have all taken to defend the Constitution. In that scenario (fanciful, I realize), both President Trump and Vice President Pence would be at risk of being impeached and removed. This combination would then create a new and separate political crisis.</p>
      <p>Why? Because the second person in the presidential <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/us-presidential-line-of-succession-list-gallery/2/">line</a> of succession, after the vice president, is the speaker of the House, who is of course currently a Democrat — Nancy Pelosi. If both Trump and Pence were removed from office, Pelosi would become president, flipping partisan control of the White House and the executive branch.</p>
      <p>That should never happen. A scandal should be able to lead to the removal of individual officials, but it should not reverse which party won an election. “If the electorate says that such-and-such a party should have the White House for four years, it ought to have the White House for four years,” Dwight Eisenhower wisely said.</p>
      <p>The potential for a partisan reversal raises all kinds of problems. It creates incentives for one party to exaggerate a scandal (which, to be clear, is not happening in this case). It can also lead to more voters distrusting an impeachment process. “The whole point of having a line of succession is to ensure a smooth transition and a continuity of administration in a time of crisis,” my colleague <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/opinion/trump-impeachment-pelosi.html?module=inline">Jesse Wegman</a> has written. “Having a leader of the opposing party take over the White House, especially in an era of intense political polarization, would not achieve that, to put it mildly.”</p>
      <p>Or as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-10-04/impeachment-shouldn-t-make-a-pelosi-presidency-possible">Jonathan Bernstein</a> of Bloomberg Opinion writes: “It’s contrary to the entire structure of the constitutional system, which separates legislative from executive institutions and forces them to share powers.”</p>
      <p>The line of succession stems from <a href="https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Presidential_Succession_Act.htm">a 1947 law</a>, and it can be changed with a new law anytime. Pelosi and House Democrats should pass such a law as soon as possible, so that every potential successor comes from the executive branch. It would be a victory for good government — and would also send a message about the severity of Trump’s and Pence’s high crimes and misdemeanors.</p>

        <b>The Democratic debate</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was pleased to see that last night’s moderators didn’t ask about Medicare — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/opinion/democratic-debate-november-msnbc.html?module=inline">an obsessive focus</a> of the early debates — in any of their first nine questions. Pete Buttigieg brought up the subject, and the moderators asked a few follow-up questions. But they didn’t allow Medicare to dominate the debate. They <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/read-democratic-debate-transcript-november-20-2019-n1088186">found time</a> for climate change, voting rights, China, the wealth tax and more. Nicely done, moderators — Rachel Maddow, Andrea Mitchell, Ashley Parker and Kristen Welker.</p>
      <p>For more on the debate, I recommend the latest installment of The Times’s “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/21/opinion/debate-winners-losers.html?module=inline">Winners and Losers</a>” feature.</p>
