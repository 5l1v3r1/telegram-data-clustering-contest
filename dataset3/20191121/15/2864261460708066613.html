      <h2>Inspection reveals exit doors blocked, other safety issues</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bashawstar.com/author/jordie-dwyer/" target="_blank">Jordie Dwyer</a></address>
      <p>A request for an occupancy report by the Bashaw Curling Club has resulted in both the club and the town needing to fix some safety issues.</p>
      <p>The report was discussed at town council’s meeting on Nov. 7 with six deficiencies reported that must be rectified by the end of the month.</p>
      <p>The inspection, completed by SCO Fire on Oct. 24, found some blocked emergency exits and some fire doors being kept open on the curling rink side while the ice resurfacing room had issues with inadequate propane storage, a build-up of combustible materials and breeches in the ceiling separations of the ice plant room.</p>
      <p>“The curling club accepted that they are responsible for three of the deficiencies — the blocked exits and the fire doors — while the town will take care of the other two,” explained CAO Theresa Fuller.</p>
      <p>No definitive plans were yet in place to have the deficiencies fixed, but the report pointed out that the fire doors must remain closed at all times and that any barriers to the exits need to be removed while the facility is in use.</p>

        <b>Lift station</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of the grinders at the sewage lift station has been requested to be replaced, as public works has stated it is generating a noise that is indicative of it starting to fail.</p>
      <p>Staff are looking to order a replacement — delivery would be from three to six weeks — so it would arrive before the current one actually fails. It was also stated that ordering prior to Christmas is advised.</p>
      <p>Fuller explained the purchase could be done through the restricted operating sewer reserve at a cost of just over $21,000, leaving nearly $6,000 in the reserve.</p>
      <p>Public Works foreman Murray Holyrod told council it seems like the bearings might be wearing out on the five-year-old unit and that rebuilding it would cost a similar amount to purchasing a new one.</p>
      <p>Council approved using the reserve funds to make the purchase and then making an effort in the 2020 budget to bring the reserve back to its present level as much as possible.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Budget request</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Bashaw Youth Foundation was in attendance to make their funding request for their 2020 budget.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Elias came to speak to council and present their request for $22,695 before the town starts their budget deliberations early in the new year.</p>
      <p>Elias thanked council for all of their previous support, adding about 30 volunteers put in more than 350 hours in assisting with the operation of their programs in the last year.</p>
      <p>“We have been working hard to keep ahead with not a lot of finances available to run our summer programs,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We also know there are a lot of kids that want to go, but struggle with it because we are not able to subsidize the cost. We refer them to where we can, but the costs are really high and we can’t take out too much for those programs, then we are left lacking in other areas.”</p>
      <p>Council accepted the request as information.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Water</b>
      </p>
      <p>Council was told that the town will face higher costs as part of the Highway 12/21 Regional Water Commission as Ferintosh will be dissolving as a municipality as of Jan. 1.</p>
      <p>Coun. Rosella Peterman stated this means the membership will fall to six and the cost to operate the commission will split among them. She added the water rate for 2020 will also be affected by this change.</p>
      <p>“As a result, a business plan review is now being done and there is a meeting with Stettler on Dec. 9 to find out what they will be charging the commission,” Peterman said.</p>
      <p>There could be another change in the near future, she stated, as the community of Edberg is having issues with its sustainability and it is possible they could dissolve as well.</p>
