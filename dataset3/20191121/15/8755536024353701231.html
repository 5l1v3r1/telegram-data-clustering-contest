      <p>As we already know, Westlife will be on The Late Late Show on Friday night.</p>
      <p>The band will be performing a number of songs, including their newest single, and will chat to host Ryan Tubridy about their pop career and stunning comeback.</p>
      <p>A select number of lucky fans will be in the audience – after over 10,000 fans applied for the chance to watch them perform live in the studio, following a call out earlier this week.</p>

      <p>Iconic newscaster Trevor McDonald will also join Ryan to talk about interviewing some of the most famous people in the world, from beloved statesmen like Nelson Mandela, to sitting down opposite dictators like Saddam Hussein and Colonel Gaddafi.</p>
