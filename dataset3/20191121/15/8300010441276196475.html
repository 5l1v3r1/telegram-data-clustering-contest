      <p>LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- The weapon used in the Saugus High School shooting that claimed the lives of two students and wounded three others was a "kit gun" assembled from parts, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told Eyewitness News.<br/><br/>Authorities are attempting to determine how the "kit gun" was assembled and by whom -- the <a href="https://abc7.com/what-we-know-about-the-suspect-in-the-saugus-high-school-shooting/5697501/">suspect</a> or his late father. When investigators searched the suspect's home as they sought a motive for the attack, six firearms were found at the home that were all registered to the suspect's late father.<br/><br/>"The mystery is trying to piece together who assembled what and at what point in time," Villanueva said.<br/><br/>"Kit guns" can be sold at gun shows, online and can be bought with 80% of the weapon already assembled.<br/><br/>"They're sold as a kit. You can legally buy it, assemble the weapon yourself and then you have a gun that is not registered and no one knows that you have it, and that is very dangerous," Villanueva said.<br/><br/><b><u>WATCH: Full interview with Sheriff Villanueva</u></b></p>
