      <p>Tesla will unveil its pickup truck, which CEO Elon Musk has called the “Cybertruck,” on Thursday in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>The event will begin at 11 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT and will likely be streamed on Tesla’s YouTube page and website, though the electric-car maker did not respond to Business Insider’s request for confirmation on if or how it will stream the event.</p>
      <p>Musk has said that, among Tesla’s upcoming vehicles, he is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-says-model-y-approved-production-2018-10">most excited</a> about the pickup truck. On Thursday, Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/230487450882019328">resurfaced</a> a tweet from 2012 in which he expressed his desire for Tesla to make a pickup truck.</p>
      <p>Tesla plans to roll out the pickup truck after its Model Y SUV, which is set to enter production next summer.</p>
      <p>Adding a pickup truck and another SUV (after the Model X luxury SUV) to its lineup could have financial benefits for Tesla. SUVs and pickup trucks comprise <a href="https://www.autonews.com/sales/light-trucks-take-record-69-us-market">well over half</a> of the US auto market and earn higher profit margins for automakers than sedans, a dynamic that could help Tesla move toward consistent profitability, as the majority of its sales come from its Model 3 sedan. While Tesla has earned profits in three of the past five quarters, it has <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/net-income">lost money</a> in every full year since it was founded in 2003.</p>
      <p>Musk has <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/2/18053424/elon-musk-tesla-spacex-boring-company-self-driving-cars-saudi-twitter-kara-swisher-decode-podcast">hinted</a> on multiple occasions that the truck will have an unusual design, citing the movie “Blade Runner” as a reference point.</p>
      <p>“Cybertruck doesn’t look like anything I’ve seen bouncing around the Internet. It’s closer to an armored personnel carrier from the future,” Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1183583315263131648">tweeted</a> in October.</p>
      <p>Musk has also made a number of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-bold-claims-tesla-pickup-truck-cybertruck-features-capabilities-2019-11">bold claims</a> about the pickup truck’s capabilities. While Tesla has a history of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-range-advantage-over-gm-jaguar-bmw-explained-2019-9">beating</a> its electric-vehicle competitors in areas like range, acceleration, and technology, Musk’s statements about the pickup truck are aggressive even by his standards.</p>
      <p>He has said that the truck will be able to tow 300,000 pounds and outperform both a Ford F-150 and a Porsche 911.</p>
