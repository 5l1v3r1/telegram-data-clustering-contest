      <p>A Mexican church has unveiled the largest statue of the baby Jesus in the world… and it looks a lot like an 80s-era <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/a-genesis-reunion-phil-collins-most-revealing-interview-yet">Phil Collins</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/church-builds-huge-baby-jesus-statue-that-looks-like-phil-collins/">New York Post</a> report that the massive sculpture stands at almost 22ft tall and weighs 2000lbs and has been placed at La Epifania del Señor church in the Mexican state of Zacatecas.</p>
      <p>Local priest Humberto Rodriguez says: “There is a space of between 26ftt between the ceiling and the floor and I ordered a statue measuring 21ft, but I never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world.”</p>

      <p>As for the likeness to the former <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-ten-best-genesis-songs-according-to-prog-readers">Genesis</a> star, Rodriguez wouldn’t say.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the previous record holder for the biggest baby Jesus statue was 16ft tall and weighed 661lbs.</p>
      <p>It's reported that Rodriguez has contacted the Guinness World Records to claim the title.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow (November 22), Collins will reissue his fourth solo album <i>...But Seriously</i> to celebrate its 30th anniversary. </p>
      <p>The new version will arrive through Rhino Records and will be limited to just 1000 double LP sets, with the 12-track follow-up to 1985’s <i>No Jacket Required</i> pressed on turquoise vinyl.</p>
