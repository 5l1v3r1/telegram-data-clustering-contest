      <h1>NeNe Leakes Produces â€˜One Of The Hottest Ladiesâ€™ Comedy Toursâ€™ Out There</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:26:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:26</time> by <a rel="author">Ron Collins</a></address>
      <p>NeNe Leakes is really hard-working, and she proudly advertised her comedy tour on her social media account. Check out NeNeâ€™s latest message to her fans below.</p>
      <p>â€˜I produce one of the hottest ladies comedy tours out! Just like that, we back! Grab yo girls and yo man too because we are coming to a city near you, and Iâ€™m bringing my girls @comiclonilove @thebsimone2 @sherrieshepherd @kymwhitley @realadelegivens and more! Go to ladiesnightoutcomedytour.com for cities and ticket info,â€™ NeNe captioned her message.</p>
      <p>A follower praised NeNe and said: â€˜Yessss Queen Nene!! Come through @thebsimone2 love you ðŸ’™â€™</p>

      <p>Someone else posted: â€˜Thatâ€™s a great line up right there. I have to check it out. ðŸ˜ƒâ€™ and one follower said: â€˜@neneleakes Will you ladies be doing a show in Arizona? I would love to come to the show.â€™</p>
      <p>Other than this, NeNeâ€™s fans were happy to see her back on the 12th season of their favorite TV show â€“ RHOA.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the massive feud between NeNe and Kenya Moore is probably without end.</p>
      <p>Itâ€™s been reported just the other day that NeNe had an interview with Extra where she addressed her late arrival and <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/nene-leakes-respnds-to-kenya-moore-saying-shes-dead-to-her-in-interview-shes-never-been-alive-to-me-342834/">responded to Kenya Mooreâ€™s shade</a>.</p>
      <p>You may be aware of the fact that not too long ago, Kenya said that NeNe was dead to her because she tried to spit on her.</p>
      <p>Jenn Lahmers brought up the comment during the latest interview with Nene, who said this: â€˜Sheâ€™s never been alive to me, so itâ€™s fine.â€™ Ouch!</p>
