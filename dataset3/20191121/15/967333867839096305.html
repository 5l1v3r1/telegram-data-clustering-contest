        <b>The 22-foot statue made of fiberglass, resin, and automotive paste is not only unique by its resemblance to the famous singer, but may also end up in the Guinness Book of World Records as it is appears to be the biggest statue representing Jesus Christ as an infant.</b>

      <p>Sometimes fans are a bit over-zealous in showing love for musicians and other celebrities, but it seems that a church in Mexico took the cake when it ordered a statue of baby <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911201077361618-erotica-au-divine-netizens-lol-as-awkward-image-of-jesus-christ-spotted-in-a-church-artwork/">Jesus Christ</a> that turned out to be a giant lookalike of Phil Collins. The 22-foot monument bears a striking resemblance to the former drummer and lead singer of Genesis with the same front hair tuft and blue eyes.</p>

      <p>Social media burst into laughter upon hearing the news.</p>

      <p>The story doesn’t end here as it turns out. The statue may end up in the Guinness Book of World Records. La Epifania del Señor church found out that the biggest statue of baby Jesus to date was just 16 feet and 661 pounds, while their statue is 22 feet and weighs 2,000 pounds. Priest Humberto Rodriguez said he has contacted Guinness World Records to confirm their record.</p>
