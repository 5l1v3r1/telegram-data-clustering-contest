      <p>The illegal break-up of a £3 million Viking hoard of “national importance” that marks the beginnings of a unified kingdom of England represents a theft of the country’s past, an expert has said.</p>
      <p>The 300-coin hoard and its priceless jewellery dated to around the ninth century.</p>
      <p>It was a tumultuous period of history in which Alfred the Great, then just King of Wessex, fought a series of battles against the Vikings.</p>
      <p>Probably buried by the retreating Vikings, the trove was dug up 1,100 years later by metal detectorists George Powell, 38, and Layton Davies, 51, on Herefordshire farmland, in 2015.</p>
      <aside>It is the fact that the knowledge has effectively been stolen from everyone<cite>Dr Gareth Williams, British Museum</cite></aside>
      <p>The pair have now been convicted at Worcester Crown Court of stealing the find, illegally concealing it from the authorities and then selling off coins to private collectors.</p>
      <p>A jury also found two other men, 60-year-old Paul Wells and Simon Wicks, 57, guilty of conspiring to conceal the hoard.</p>
      <p>Wicks was also found guilty of helping sell off the coins for cash.</p>
      <p>Dr Gareth Williams, curator of early medieval coinage at the British Museum, said: “It is not just the theft of the objects that is important in this case.</p>
      <p>“It is the fact that the knowledge has effectively been stolen from everyone.”</p>

      <p>He added: “It dates from after, I would say, Alfred has got that new ambition of being king of the Angles and the Saxons.</p>
      <p>“You could say it’s the first hoard of this newly united kingdom that would later become Anglo-Saxon.”</p>
      <p>The trial heard only a single silver ingot, three jewellery items and 31 of the coins have been recovered.</p>
      <p>Photos on Davies’ phone – deleted and then recovered by police – showed many more items dug out of the ground on farmland near Leominster, including more ingots and up to 300 coins.</p>

      <p>Among the coinage were five rare “Two Emperor” pennies suggesting an alliance between Alfred and the last King of Mercia, Ceolwulf II, and bearing both men’s image, worth up to £50,000 apiece.</p>
      <p>There was also a “hugely significant” gold serpent’s head arm bangle and “showpiece” gold ring, both from the era, and a fifth-century rock crystal pendant intricately chased in gold, probably of Frankish origin.</p>
      <p>The items recovered – including five coins found stitched in the lining of a magnifying glass case – are now safely under lock and key at the British Museum.</p>
      <p>Explaining the hoard’s importance, Dr Williams, who gave expert evidence during the trial, said: “It is potentially extremely important.</p>
      <p>“The difficulty is we don’t have all of it and therefore we can only guess at the full importance.”</p>

      <p>He added the find was discovered before the Watlington Hoard, from the same era, in 2015, and was probably buried earlier.</p>
      <p>The trove was likely looted by Vikings, with Dr Williams adding it was originally “likely to have been sitting in a royal or church treasury somewhere”, and Leominster was the site of an important monastery at the time.</p>
      <p>“If we had the whole of the two (hoards) we’d have a much clearer understanding of that period,” added Dr Williams.</p>
      <p>Turning to the loss of much of the Leominster hoard, he said: “This is a find of national importance from a key moment in the unification of England.</p>
      <p>“So it comes just at the moment when the Vikings were attacking in a large way.</p>
      <p>“There were several different Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, two of which had already been defeated and conquered and a third was struggling.</p>
      <p>“What this (hoard) shows is the king of Mercia, Ceolwulf II, was involved in an active alliance with Alfred of Wessex.”</p>
      <p>Little is known of Ceolwulf other than he reigned for five years, 874-879.</p>
      <p>The coins marking the alliance were then driven out of circulation by Alfred soon afterwards, with only “passing references” which are dismissive of Ceolwulf in accounts of the time.</p>
      <p>Dr Williams said: “In 879, Alfred is starting that process of re-writing of history.”</p>
      <p>He added: “Ceolwulf is completely dismissed, and yet the coins with these two hoards, is showing the alliance between Alfred and Ceolwulf.</p>
      <p>“Then he just mysteriously disappears .</p>
      <p>“All of a sudden Alfred has got his kingdom and in fact is then dividing up that kingdom.</p>
      <p>“You’d think him getting hold of another kingdom would be worth celebrating, which suggests his getting hold of it was not entirely creditable.</p>
      <p>“The hoard sheds some light on that period.”</p>
      <p>Dr Williams added: “All of that is lost.</p>
      <p>“We will probably never know entirely what was in it.</p>
      <p>“I am still hoping more may yet be recovered.</p>
      <p>“One of the things we will be doing, once this case is over, is looking at things in more detail, because everything has been sitting in evidence bags in a cupboard.”</p>
      <p>Powell, of Kirby Lane, Newport, Davies, of Cardiff Road, Pontypridd, Wells, of Newport Road, Cardiff, and Wicks, of Hawks Road, Hailsham, East Sussex, will be sentenced at a later date.</p>
