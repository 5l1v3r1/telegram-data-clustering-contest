      <p>In making sure that gifting season doesn’t turn into a wasteful season this year, here’s a thoughtful gift without giving to landfill.</p>
      <p>Big advocates of <i>living lightly</i> on this planet, environmental experts Kaipātiki Project looked at gift alternatives that eliminate any unnecessary wrapping, packaging and transportation. They found a solution in what they know best – native trees – from growing to planting!</p>
      <p>“This season, we encourage people to make conscious choices when selecting gifts,” says Manager Janet Cole.</p>
      <p>“By gifting a native tree through Kaipātiki Project, you can rest assured that these trees have been eco-sourced and grown chemically-free at our nursery, which is how we do things.”</p>
      <p>Every tree will be looked after by passionate volunteers at Kaipātiki Project’s nursery, where on average a tree is handled 8 times from a seedling to planting.</p>
      <p>“As a community-based organisation, we’ll make sure all involved are invited to join the planting day or we’ll plant gifted trees on their behalf.”</p>
      <p>“Together we’ll see the impact we’re making in our local reserves and watch the trees grow for many years to come!”</p>
      <p>To gift your tree, visit <a href="http://www.kaipatiki.org.nz/">www.kaipatiki.org.nz</a> and get your gifts sorted today!</p>
