      <p>But this week her flashy Land Rover ended up at a car auction and sold to a a used car dealership in Essex.</p>
      <p>The pink Urban vehicle had the sign "repo" - short for repossession - on the windscreen.</p>
      <p>A witness at the dealership told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7710421/Katie-Prices-iconic-pink-Range-Rover-repossessed-sale-Essex-used-car-garage.html">MailOnline</a>: "It’s a very striking car but we didn’t know straight away that it belonged to Katie Price.</p>
      <p>"But then one of the buyers told us that it was hers. We couldn't believe how filthy it was."</p>

      <p>Katie was banned from driving for two years last month after refusing to tell cops who was behind the wheel when her pink Range Rover crashed last year.</p>
      <p>She failed to appear at the Bexley Magistrates Court sentencing and was slapped with six penalty points and the ban.</p>
      <p>She's now without her famous flashy car, but it's not yet known how much the Range Rover will go for at the dealership.</p>
      <p>It's been a dramatic year for Katie, who narrowly avoided bankruptcy in December 2018 when the tax man accepted her plan to repay her debt.</p>

      <p>She is being pursued by creditors and entered into a Individual Voluntary Agreement over her estimated £250,000 debts to the High Court.</p>
      <p>The reality star could be made bankrupt before Christmas after allegedly failing to keep up with her monthly payments.</p>

      <p>In January this year, Katie attempted to sell-off her second pink car for £90,000.</p>
      <p>She later told Flex FM she wanted rid of her pink vehicle fleet because they "get me me into trouble".</p>
      <p>The Sun Online has approached Katie's PR for comment.</p>
