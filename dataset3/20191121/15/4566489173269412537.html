      <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday bestowed the country's top state honour on two pilots who safely landed a plane carrying more than 230 people in a corn field after a bird strike.</p>
      <p>At a ceremony in the Kremlin, Putin handed pilot Damir Yusupov and co-pilot Georgy Murzin the Hero of Russia awards, praising the crew's courage and professionalism.</p>
      <p>"They were able to land the plane literally in an empty field and saved dozens of lives," Putin said.</p>
      <p>Yusupov, 42, who wore his pilot uniform, said the award was a recognition of the crew's actions.</p>
      <p>"I am very proud and inspired to further serve our motherland," he said.</p>
      <p>Murzin, who also wore a uniform, said he would continue to "perfect his professional skills and ensure flight safety."</p>
      <p>At 23, Murzin is one of the youngest Russians to receive the Hero of Russia award.</p>
      <p>In August, the Ural Airlines Airbus A321 flying to Crimea hit a flock of seagulls shortly after take-off from Moscow's Zhukovsky airport.</p>
      <p>Birds were sucked into the engines and the crew decided to immediately land, bringing the plane down in the corn field about a kilometre from the runway, with the engines off and the landing gear retracted.</p>
      <p>The aircraft, carrying 226 passengers and seven crew, was evacuated using inflatable ramps.</p>
      <p>Russian media called the landing a "miracle" and drew comparisons with US pilot Chesley "Sully" Sullenberger's 2009 landing of a US Airways airliner in the Hudson River after a bird strike.</p>
      <p>After the accident Yusupov has stopped introducing himself to passengers, telling reporters that people reacted emotionally to his name, especially during in-flight turbulence.</p>
