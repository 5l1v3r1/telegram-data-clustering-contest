      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> has become a firm favourite in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here</a> camp, alongside Caitlyn Jenner and Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>And it turns out the Rak-Su singer, 28, has a famous ex, after it was revealed he previously dated Malin Andersson – and our minds are truly blown.</p>
      <p>However, despite their past, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star-turned body positivity icon is rooting for EastEnders actress <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> to go far in the ITV jungle.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to <b>Metro.co.uk</b> about her history with the X Factor winner, she told us: ‘I dated him [about] five years ago,’ she laughed.</p>
      <p>‘That was years ago. I’m not going to say anything else.’</p>
      <p>Fair enough.</p>
      <p>Discussing this year’s show, she continued: ‘I like Jacqueline Jossa, I think she’s going to be cool. And the rugby player, James Haskell, he seems quite funny.</p>

      <p>Especially now that Caitlyn has started dropping those Kardashian secrets…</p>
      <p>Myles and Jacqueline have a bizarre connection in the jungle – as the EastEnders star’s husband, Dan Osborne, is rumoured to have been unfaithful with Gabby Allen, who previously dated the X Factor winner.</p>
      <p>Seriously, we cannot keep up.</p>

      <p>Dan and Gabby have fiercely denied any cheat claims, maintaining they are just friends.</p>
      <p>However, an insider has now claimed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-myles-stephenson-will-tell-jacqueline-jossa-everything-husband-dans-connection-gabby-allen-11194175/">Myles is ‘willing’ to clear anything up that Jacqueline</a> has questions about.</p>
      <p>‘Myles would be willing to tell Jacqueline everything – and answer any questions she might have,’ a source told The Sun.</p>
      <p>‘Myles will tell Jacqueline everything Gabby told him. It’s a good thing Gabby’s gone to Thailand for a month because she might find it uncomfortable watching.’</p>
