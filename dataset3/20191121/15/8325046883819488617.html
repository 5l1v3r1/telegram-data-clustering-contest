      <p>Apple hasn’t turned a profit on repairing people’s broken devices in the past decade, the company disclosed this week.</p>
      <p>The company made the disclosure <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU05/20190716/109793/HHRG-116-JU05-20190716-SD036.pdf">in response to a House Judicial Committee probe</a>, which is investigating whether Apple engages in anticompetitive practices to edge out competition when it comes to repairs and third-party apps.</p>
      <p>Apple maintains strict control over who can repair users’ broken iPhones, iPads, and Macs – however, it recently made it easier for <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/08/apple-offers-customers-even-more-options-for-safe-reliable-repairs/">certain independent repair stores</a> to become authorized to use Apple parts and manuals for out-of-warranty repairs.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/democrats.judiciary.house.gov/files/documents/Apple%20RFI%20-%20Signed.pdf">letter sent to Apple in September</a>, lawmakers pressed Apple on its refusal to allow independent repair stores that it has not authorized to fix broken devices, asking if that’s “just a way for Apple to elbow out competition and extend its monopoly into the market for repairs.”</p>
      <p>Apple’s vice president of corporate law, Kyle Andeer, responded to lawmakers’ questions this week, arguing that Apple does not allow third-party repairs in order to ensure the quality and safety of repairs. In response to a question about how much revenue Apple makes from repair services, Andeer said the company doesn’t turn a profit – it actually loses money fixing devices.</p>
      <p>“For each year since 2009, the costs of providing repair services has exceeded the revenue generated by repairs,” Andeer wrote.</p>
