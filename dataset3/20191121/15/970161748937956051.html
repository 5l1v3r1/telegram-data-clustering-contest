      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> believes <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> are capable of challenging for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title next season despite their current struggles, while he says he will adapt his own style to suit the squad.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach held his first press conference since replacing Mauricio Pochettino on Thursday afternoon and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/jose-mourinho-tribute-mauricio-pochettino-first-tottenham-press-conference-11195574/">paid tribute to the work done by his predecessor</a> during his five-and-a-half years at the club.</p>
      <p>Although Spurs are currently 14th place in the table, and 11 points adrift of the top four, Mourinho is convinced the core of the team is good enough to challenge in the not too distant future.</p>

      <p>Asked if he believes Tottenham will be contenders next year, he said: ‘We cannot win the Premier League this season. We can – I’m not saying we will do – we can win next season.’</p>

      <p>Mourinho is often criticised for his defensive, pragmatic approach, but he has hinted that he could tweak his own style to fit the squad he has inherited and does not plan to deviate too much from the work Pochettino did.</p>
      <p>Asked how the side will play, Mourinho explained: ‘Very similar to before [under Pochettino]. That’s what I keep saying. Very similar to before.</p>
      <p>‘Of course I’m going to try to add some details, and sometimes details can make the difference, and progressively we will arrive to a fingerprint.</p>
      <p>‘But the style of play has to be always adapted, not just to the club culture but especially the players’ qualities. That’s the way it is.</p>

      <p>‘These are the players. They have their qualities, adapted to a certain way of playing football, and that’s the way we want to do it.’</p>
      <p>He added: ‘I don’t want to make big changes. I want to respect the base and the base is the work they [Pochettino and his staff] did for five years.</p>
      <p>‘The base is what they did before. This is not about me. I am not here to make drastic changes.’</p>
