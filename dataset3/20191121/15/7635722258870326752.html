        <b>2018 Arkle champion Footpad is back to winning ways, easing to a ten-lengths success on his seasonal reappearance in the Listed Chase at Thurles.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Willie Mullins-trained seven-year-old won four Grade Ones as a novice chaser but struggled for form last year.</p>
      <p>Despite sitting in tenth for much of the race, the 8/11 favourite showed his pace to pull away from the field and easily see off a late rally from Mala Beach.</p>
      <p>Mala Beach was second with 2018 Ryanair Chase winner Balko Des Flos back in fourth.</p>

      <p>"It is lovely to see the horse back on the racetrack and he had plenty of enthusiasm and jumped and travelled very, very well," said winning jockey Daryl Jacob after the race.</p>
      <p>"It's a great starting point for him and he never missed a beat the whole way around.</p>
      <p>"Today's trip wasn't a problem for him and ideally going a little bit quicker early doors would have suited him, but he is nice and fresh and it was good to see a performance like that this early in the year.  It was mission accomplished today."</p>
