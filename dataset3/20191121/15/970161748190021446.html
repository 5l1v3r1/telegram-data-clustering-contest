      <p>An unwanted cat is facing his second Christmas without a home – because he always hides away when people come to see him.</p>
      <p>Eleven-year-old Toby has now spent 332 days under RSPCA care in Canterbury, Kent.</p>
      <p>He was taken in on Christmas Eve last year after previously living in a house with 45 other cats, 15 of which ended up with the animal charity.</p>
      <p>RSPCA centre manager Beth Hixson said: ‘Toby’s former housemates were rehomed quite quickly, but poor Toby didn’t cope well with being in the cattery so hid away and wouldn’t come out to see people when they came to choose.’</p>
      <p>The average length of time a cat stays is just 28 days and all the others who came with Toby have now found permanent homes.</p>
      <p>Beth said: ‘We’d love to see him in a new home for Christmas. There must be someone out there looking for an older cat for some company.</p>

      <p>‘He loves to snuggle up on the bed at night and spend sunny days exploring the garden. He just needs to find a home where he can enjoy doing this for the rest of his days.’</p>

      <p>The black and white cat would suit a quiet home without children or other pets to make the most of his retirement.</p>
      <p>He is currently living with a foster family where has has proven himself to be ‘sociable, friendly and interactive’. But he needs to find somewhere he can stay for good.</p>
      <p>The RSPCA said they expected more than 10,000 vulnerable animals like Toby to be taken in over the winter months.</p>
      <p>On Christmas Day last year, there were 934 calls to the charity’s cruelty line. This is the highest number for five years and a 28% increase compared to 2017.</p>
