      <p>If you ever wanted to be Woody from Toy Story, boah do I have news for you. The Red Dead Redemption 2 PC mod which lets you soar like an eagle, play as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-08-red-dead-redemption-2-players-find-missing-princess-in-game-files">missing Princess Isabeau</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-09-red-dead-redemption-2-mod-lets-you-play-in-the-nip">completely in the nip</a> has had another update - and this time, it's all about size. Not that it's the most important thing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mod-rdr.com/files/file/7-lennys-simple-trainer/">Lenny's Simple Trainer</a>, authored by LMS on the website Mod Red Dead, is now in version 0.7, and has significantly improved in the space of only a few weeks. Holding F5 now brings up an in-game menu to let you easily swap between modes, and the new scaling features have provided me with yet another morning of fun, and strange looks from my colleagues.</p>
      <p>By selecting "player" then "model scale", you can either supersize your chosen model all the way up to twenty times the normal size, or shrink it all the way down to 10 per cent of the original height. The scaling only seems to work on the character model itself, while items remain the same size - and therefore seemingly enormous in proportion.</p>

      <p>Big iron.</p>
      <p>In order to take some prettier photos, I managed to swap to Dutch and another model of Arthur (without the revolver on his hip) and setting my weapons to invisible using the trainer. Somewhat amusingly, other characters in the game recognise your reduced height and will watch you running around as a tiny cowboy. Unfortunately they still seem to have suspiciously good aim, as I found out when I began a shootout. I'm calling hacks.</p>

      <p>If you spawn a horse before altering your player model's size, you can also change said horse's height and transform it into a mount-ain. I'd recommend setting it to either size three or five if you want to see the whole horse, as after a certain size the model looks terrible and it clips into the ground. This also means you can't laugh at the giant horse balls. Gigantamaxing Arthur and his horse to the larger sizes can lead to some freaky results, so use with caution.</p>

      <p>Spaghetti Western.</p>
      <p>Of course, this mod allows you to change into practically any model in the game, and so I ran around Saint Denis as a large crab, before terrorising various towns as an oversized turkey and a chonky eagle.</p>

      <p>Oh no, not another Jurassic Park sequel.</p>
      <p>Naturally, I had to combine this newfound knowledge <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-11-09-red-dead-redemption-2-mod-lets-you-play-in-the-nip">with my previous article</a> to see if I could create Gulliver with his pants down. I can confirm this is indeed possible. The skin texture on, err... certain areas looks very weird when stretched to that size, however. Might want to get that checked out.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://d2skuhm0vrry40.cloudfront.net/2019/articles/2019-11-21-14-37/covered_up_gulliver.png/EG11/resize/1280x-1/quality/75/format/jpg"/>

      <p>Unfortunately it's currently a little difficult to actually play the game as one of the giant characters, as the camera doesn't adjust to accommodate for the significant increase in scale. Perhaps it's only a matter of time before the ability to zoom out mid-gameplay is added to the trainer. In the meantime, you can use the free camera in Red Dead Redemption 2's photo mode to take some snaps of your oversized cowboys.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lenny's Simple Trainer has also added a feature which lets you summon your own giant eagle to mow down enemies with a volley of arrows. Just summon the "gunship" in the bodyguards menu, then focus on an enemy and press F8 to send in the eagle. Why didn't Gandalf just use this ability all the time?</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>The trainer also has a number of other useful features, such as teleporting, spawning weapons and vehicles, along with classic cheats such as godmode and extra money. If you're hoping to use the trainer, simply pop all the mod files into your game directory, and edit the character line in the Ist.ini file to add <a href="https://www.mod-rdr.com/wiki/list-of-rdr2-ped-models/">extra models from this list</a>. Make sure to create a backup of your files before modding, and avoid saving (including autosaves) when using the trainer. And, obviously, don't play online with the trainer installed - as it could result in a ban.</p>
      <p>If you've got all that, enjoy your travels as Gulliver in the wild west. Fingers crossed you don't get lassoed by the locals.</p>
