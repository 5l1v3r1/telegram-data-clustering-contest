      <p>The Galaxy A71 smartphone is not very different from the already leaked Galaxy A51 smartphone. The A71 features a flat display, which measures 6.7-inch. The smartphone will feature a centered punch-hole design, making the smartphone look more like the Note 10.</p>
      <p>Talking about the camera, at the rear, you’ll find four cameras arranged in such a way that the shape appears similar to that of the letter “L”. Accompanying these four cameras will be an LED flash. And housing the quad-camera set-up will be a rectangular camera bump at the back. Unfortunately, you’re still unaware of the megapixel count.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the smartphone is 9.22 mm in thickness, has a 3.5 mm headphone jack and measures roughly around 163.5 x 76 x 7.9mm (9.2mm including rear camera bump).</p>
