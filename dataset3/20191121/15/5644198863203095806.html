      <p>KATHMANDU: New ministers were inducted into Nepal's government on Thursday (Nov 21) as part of a cabinet reshuffle by ailing Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, who is trying to strengthen his grip, improve ties with a powerful ally and minimise internal party conflict.</p>
      <p>A government statement issued late Wednesday said Oli dropped six cabinet ministers and three junior ministers.</p>

      <p>Oli's critics said the political leader was adding loyalists to his government because political allies were questioning the 67-year-old leader's authority. He has been in poor health since a kidney transplant in India in 2007.</p>
      <p>Although local media have reported that Oli may seek further treatment soon, his office has remained silent on the issue.</p>
      <p>Oli, a moderate Communist, led a coalition with former Maoist rebels to a shock victory in national elections about two years ago. The former Maoists have since merged with Oli's group.</p>
      <p>In what was seen as a large concession to former Maoists, Oli agreed to allow former rebel chief Prachanda to be the executive chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, a party spokesman told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Prachanda has been pressing Oli to let him take over as prime minister before his term expired in 2022 under a power sharing deal between the two leaders.</p>
      <p>Independent political analysts allowing Prachanda to run the party will let Oli complete his term as prime minister.</p>
      <p>Oli during his first term stood up against a border standoff with India, a neighbouring power with major political and economic clout in Nepal.</p>
      <p>The dispute resulted in a months-long shortage of essential goods like fuel and medicines in 2015 and 2016. India has denied imposing a blockade.</p>
      <p>Since then Oli has been considered closer to China, which agreed to study whether a Chinese rail link could be extended to Nepal's capital city, Kathmandu, and to help construct a tunnel across the Himalayas to Tibet.</p>
      <p>China has also agreed to grant landlocked Nepal access to its roads and ports as the Himalayan nation seeks to lessen the dominance of India.</p>
