      <h1>A&amp;E service for victims of domestic violence rescued</h1>
      <h2>But it is not clear whether the staff contracts will remain short-term, potentially still affecting recruitment</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:56:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Cameron</a></address>
      <p>A hospital-based service for victims of domestic violence in Bristol has been rescued but questions remain over its future.</p>
      <p>The independent advisory service for victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence and their children is offered at the accident and emergency department of the Bristol Royal Infirmary. </p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/university-hospitals-bristol-nhs-foundation-trust">University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust</a>, which runs the BRI, suddenly found itself unable to continue providing the service because it could not recruit enough staff, due to only being able to offer short term contracts.</p>
      <p>Independent domestic violence advisors (IDVAs) are commissioned by the council using funding from Public Health England.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> stepped in at “short notice” to find another provider, Next Link, which already runs a similar service at <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-bristol-nhs-trust">Southmead Hospital</a> A&amp;E.</p>
      <p>Next Link will receive just over £135,000 of public health funding from the council to provide the IDVA service at the BRI A&amp;E for 22 and a half months.</p>
      <p>But it is not clear whether the staff contracts will remain short-term, potentially still affecting recruitment.</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman said the authority did not know whether the contracts were short or long term, and attempts to reach Next Link by phone and email were unsuccessful.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the UHB Trust said: “In order to provide the safest and most robust care for our patients, it was decided that recommissioning the service would be the best option.</p>
      <p>“This decision was made following discussion with Bristol City Council, and we have worked with them throughout this process.”</p>
      <p>Next Link, which took over running the service on September 16, was the only provider able to “step in and offer this service within the timescale required”, according to the council. </p>
      <p>Under a contract agreed by the ruling <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> cabinet this month, Next Link will provide two IDVA staff at the BRI A&amp;E between 8am and 4pm Monday to Friday.</p>

      <p>This is when most patients who experience domestic abuse attend the A&amp;E at Southmead Hospital, according to information from Next Link provided in the cabinet report.</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman said: “Bristol City Council is dedicated to supporting survivors of domestic abuse and Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) are an important service that helps achieve this. </p>
      <p>“We are recommissioning this service using funding from the Public Health grant and have committed funding until 31 July 2021. </p>
      <p>“An IDVA employed by University Hospital Bristol previously delivered the service, but as of 16 September 2019, Next Link will run this service that ensures survivors of abuse receive the support they need.”</p>
      <p>Speaking in City Hall on November 5, cabinet member for women, children and young people, Helen Godwin, said: “I’m just really sort of proud and grateful that we are running a council that is willing to step in and willing to say this is an important service and we cannot lose it because of stretched funding in one our statutory partners.”</p>
      <p>The UHB Trust spokesman said that recruiting suitable and experienced independent domestic and sexual violence advisors (IDSVAs) was an ongoing national problem. </p>
      <p>“A comprehensive IDSVA service will still be available to patients [at the BRI] and our emergency department has thorough safeguarding processes in place to identify and help protect patients who could be at risk of domestic and sexual violence.</p>
      <p>“Once a patient had disclosed and has asked for help we would offer immediate emotional support and reassure her/him that they had done the right thing and that we could help to make them and their children safe.</p>
      <p>“Support for patients will be up to four weeks and they will engage at least 60 victims a quarter.”</p>
      <p>Support includes assessing victims and helping with any issues, such as housing and debt, that could make them more vulnerable, putting them and their children in further danger.</p>
      <p>Under the contract, Next Link will also teach hospital clinicians how to recognise the signs and symptoms of domestic abuse and how to refer them for help.</p>
      <p>Next Link describes itself as the major provider of domestic abuse services in Bristol and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a>.</p>
