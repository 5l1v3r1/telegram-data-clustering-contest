      <h1>The original Gerber baby is now a 93-year-old mystery novelist</h1>

      <p>The original Gerber baby with sparkling eyes and a cherubic face is all grown up -- with a full head of white hair and the same contagious smile.</p>
      <p>And that iconic baby, Ann Turner Cook, just turned 93 on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"Happy birthday to the OG -- that's Original Gerber -- baby, Ann Turner Cook!" the company captioned a picture of her next to a jar with the classic logo.</p>
      <p>The charcoal sketch of Cook's angelic face as a four-month-old has adorned jars of baby food for decades. In 1928, Gerber held an advertising campaign looking for the company's new face. Cook's neighbour submitted a drawing of her face for the contest and three years later, it became Gerber's official trademark.</p>
      <p>The company had invited artists to submit different versions of Gerber babies as part of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The neighbor, Dorothy Hope Smith, offered to add more details to the sketch if it was accepted. But when the executives at Gerber saw it, they wanted it as-is.</p>
      <p>Gerber has expanded its business beyond food to include skin care, clothing and other children's products, but the face of the original Gerber baby remains plastered on most items.</p>
      <p>Before the name behind the angelic face was revealed in 1978, popular guesses of the baby's identity included Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, Sen. Bob Dole and Jane Seymour.</p>
      <p>Cook taught English in Florida and wrote mystery novels after her retirement.</p>
