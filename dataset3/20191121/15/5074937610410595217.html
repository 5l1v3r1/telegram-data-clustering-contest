      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 20, GNA - Students participating in a forum to mark the observation of Global 4H Day in Ghana at Koforidua in the Eastern Region have called for a more focus on the promotion of gardening in schools.</p>
      <p>This the students argued could help get more young people in the country to be interested in agriculture.</p>
      <p>The students were from 4H Ghana school clubs in New Juaben Senior High School(SHS), Koforidua Secondary Technical SHS and the Koforidua Ghana National SHS.</p>
      <p>4H Ghana is a youth focus organization which was started in the USA and now has branches all over the world.</p>
      <p>This year’s celebration of Global 4H  Day was observed under the theme: Making agriculture more attractive to young people.</p>
      <p>Mr Appiah Kweku Boateng, the Executive  Director of 4H Ghana, called for collaboration with his organization and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture(MOFA) on how to make the young people part of the efforts to ensure  food security for the country.</p>
      <p>He appealed to the curriculum development unit of the Ghana Education Service to reintroduce agriculture science as a subject in schools.</p>
      <p>Mr Boateng explained that such a development would provide the opportunity for more  young people to select the subject and adopt it as their vocation.</p>
