      <p>GARDAÍ HAVE MADE a total of four new arrests in relation to the abduction of Quinn Industrial Holdings director Kevin Lunney.</p>
      <p>Two men – both aged 38 – were arrested this morning in the Dublin region for an offence contrary to Section 73 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.</p>
      <p>They are being detained under Section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 at Ballymun and Finglas garda stations.</p>
      <p>Another two men weere arrested today, gardaí said in a statement this afternoon.</p>
      <p>A 25-year-old man was detained in Dublin while a 66-year-old man was arrested in Cavan.</p>
      <p>Lunney, 50, was snatched near his Co Fermanagh home and brutally assaulted in September.</p>
      <p>The father-of-six spoke out about the attack in a BBC Spotlight interview, describing how he had been slashed with a knife, doused with bleach and branded by his captors before being dumped on a remote road in Co Cavan.</p>
      <p>Criminals targeting QIH executives are believed to have been behind the attack. A cross-border police investigation is under way.</p>
      <p>The arrests this morning come after three people were arrested and later released last week in connection with the assault on Lunney.</p>
      <p>Two men – one in his 20s and another in his 40s – had been arrested along with a woman in her 50s. They’ve since been released without charge and a file has been prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. </p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the main suspect in the investigation, Cyril McGuinness, <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/kevin-lunney-suspect-death-4884220-Nov2019/">died after taking ill</a> during a police raid on a property in Derbyshire in the UK.</p>
