        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/carlos-sainz">Carlos Sainz</a> has been one of the most consistent performers of 2019. He has performed incredibly well for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mclaren">McLaren</a> and many believe that he would do a good job at any of the top teams. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Having been part of the junior <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull</a> set up, racing for <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso">Toro Rosso</a>, he was let go and it is almost certain that they will regret letting the Spaniard go. He would be the perfect driver to race alongside <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>. </p>

      <p><i>“The question marks about Red Bull's second driver are not really made easier by the excellent form of former employee Carlos Sainz. They will not admit it, but I am sure that Red Bull is not only disappointed that (Daniel, ed.) Ricciardo is gone, but also that they have not chosen Sainz as a replacement for the Aussie," </i>Jolyon<i> </i>Palmer said in is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1"><i>BBC Sport</i></a> column. </p>

        <i>“Sainz was able to push Verstappen well in 2015 and 2016. If he could have done that this year too, Red Bull would have been much more impressive than the Verstappen show that it is now.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Sainz will hope that McLaren can drag themselves up to the top of Formula 1 and that he can prove Red Bull wrong.  </p>
