      <p>The minister for Chieftaincy and Religious Affairs, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi has debunked claims there’s going to be a construction of a national shrine right after the National Cathedral is built.</p>
      <p>News went viral yesterday that government intends building a shrine akin to the cathedral to satisfy traditionalists.</p>
      <p>But responding to the claims on Adom FM’s morning show ‘Dwaso Nsem’, the Minister said there is no iota of truth in the publications.</p>
      <p>He said: “Just yesterday at my press briefing, someone asked a question why the government isn’t putting up a shrine, rather concentrating on building a national cathedral.</p>
      <p>And I responded by saying that some Wolomei (GA Traditional Priests) have presented a petition on that,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And we can only look at their plea, but I never said I was going to build a national shrine,” he clarified.</p>
