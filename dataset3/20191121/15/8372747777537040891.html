      <p>NORFOLK, Va. — Antonella Barba, a <a href="https://wtkr.com/2019/11/21/former-american-idol-contestant-to-serve-45-months-behind-bars-on-drug-charges/">former “American Idol” contestant, will serve 45 months behind bars</a> after being found guilty of possession with intent to distribute 400 grams or more of fentanyl.</p>
      <p>According to court documents, Barba, 32, was parked in downtown Norfolk, Virginia, at approximately 11:05 p.m. in October 2018 when she was approached by law enforcement. When a drug dog screened Barba’s rental vehicle, it found a closed shoebox that contained a large quantity of a white, rock-like substance.</p>
      <p>A forensic scientist determined the substance to be fentanyl.</p>
      <p>Barba was on the sixth season of “American Idol” in 2007 where she placed in the top 16.</p>
