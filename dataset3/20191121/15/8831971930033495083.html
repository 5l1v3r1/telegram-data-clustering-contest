      <p>The iconic TV series, ‘Friends,’ is known for having some of the best holiday episodes, especially their famous Thanksgiving ones. If you’re having trouble thinking up captions for the holiday, look no further. Here are some timeless one-liner moments in the show that you can 100% swipe as caption inspiration.</p>
      <h3>“The One Where Underdog Gets Away” (Season 1, Episode 9)</h3>
      <p>It’s almost inevitable for things to go completely wrong during the holidays. Like in this episode where the gang is locked out of Monica and Rachel’s apartment.</p>
      <p><i>“Reliving past pain and getting depressed is what Thanksgiving’s all about.”</i> –<i> </i>Chandler</p>
      <p><i>“I know this isn’t the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn’t involve divorce or projectile vomiting.” – </i>Chandler</p>
      <p><i>“Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.”</i> – Joey</p>
      <p><i>“Everyone wants a different kind of potato. So I’m making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want?”</i> – Monica</p>
      <p><i>“Cider’s mulling, turkey’s turking, yams are yamming.”</i> – Monica</p>
      <h3>“The One With The List” (Season 2, Episode 8)</h3>
      <p>In this episode, Chandler and Joey help Ross creates a pros and cons list to choose between Julie and Rachel, and the feud between Ross and Rachel begin.</p>
      <p><i>“Oh, sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!”</i> – Phoebe</p>
      <h3>“The One Where Ross Got High” (Season 6, Episode 9)</h3>
      <p>One of the funniest episodes from this show, when Rachel makes her famously disgusting layered dessert, and her crush/assistant, Tag, shows up for dinner.</p>
      <p><i>“Offering people gum is not cooking.”</i> – Chandler</p>
      <p><i>“What is with everyone today? It’s Thanksgiving, not truth day!”</i> – Ross</p>

      <h3>“The One With The Rumor” (Season 8, Episode 9)</h3>
      <p>Okay, probably one of the most iconic cameos of the whole show. Rachel, Ross, and Monica’s high school alum, Will (played by Brad Pitt), make things intense and awkward during dinner when he brings up his long term hatred towards Rachel.</p>
      <p><i>“You can’t have Thanksgiving without turkey. That’s like <u><a href="http://collegecandy.com/tag/fourth-of-july/">Fourth of July</a></u> without apple pie or Friday with no two pizzas.”</i> – Joey</p>
      <p><i>“Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross — Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.”</i> – Will</p>
      <p><i>“These are my Thanksgiving pants!”</i> – Joey</p>
      <p><i>“Otherwise, what’s next? Today, I’m just a guy who can’t finish a turkey. Tomorrow, I’m the guy who eats half a power bar, wraps up the rest, and puts it in the fridge?”</i> – Joey</p>
      <p><i>“God, we were lame back then.”</i> – Will</p>
      <h3>“The One With Rachel’s Other Sister” (Season 9, Episode 8)</h3>
      <p>This episode represents all the fights between family, especially your siblings, during the holidays. Rachel’s middle sister joins the bunch for dinner where they break out into a huge heated argument. Oh, and of course the one where Monica brings out the fancy plates.</p>
      <p><i>“You know what I cannot believe? That my so-called sister gets a 30% discount from Ralph Lauren, and I still have to pay retail?” – </i>Amy</p>
      <p><i>“Just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.”</i> – Monica</p>
      <h3>“The One With The Late Thanksgiving” (Season 10, Episode 8)</h3>
      <p>Another timeless one. Ross and Joey go to a Rangers game, and Rachel and Phoebe enter Emma in a pageant, making them all almost an hour late for Monica and Chandler’s dinner. Everyone is starving and angry making this episode as hilarious as it is.</p>
      <p><i>“It’s Thanksgiving and we should not want to be together, together.”</i> – Rachel</p>
      <p><i>“Happy needless-turkey-murder day.” –</i> Phoebe</p>
      <p><i>“They’ve ruined Cranberry Day!”</i> – Ross</p>
      <p><i>“This Thanksgiving kicks last Thanksgiving’s!”</i> – Monica</p>
      <p><i>“Don’t you put words in people’s mouths! You put turkey in people’s mouths!”</i> – Joey</p>
      <p><i>“Okay guys, I have exactly 28 minutes before I have to baste again.”</i> – Monica</p>
