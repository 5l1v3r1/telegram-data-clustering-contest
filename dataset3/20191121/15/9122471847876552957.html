      <h1>Joel Klatt Says LSU Is The Baker Mayfield-Oklahoma Team</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:39:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>FOX Sports college football analyst Joel Klatt ruffled some feathers earlier this week when he put LSU at No. 3 in his rankings behind Ohio State and Clemson. Amidst the criticism, Klatt explained his reasoning and made an interesting comparison to the Baker Mayfield-led Oklahoma teams.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday’s edition of <i>The Herd</i>, Klatt pointed out that LSU’s defense is ranked a major liability. He noted that during the BCS era, only one team won a national title without a top 25 defense – LSU’s is ranked 53rd.</p>
      <p>But in pointing out LSU’s potential path to a national title, Klatt asserted that LSU is doing what Baker Mayfield attempted to do with Oklahoma in 2017: Overwhelm teams with offense so much that defense is a non-factor.</p>
      <blockquote>“This is the Baker Mayfield version of Oklahoma. That’s what LSU is right now.”</blockquote>

      <p>He did point out that Oklahoma almost beat Georgia in the College Football Playoff that year.</p>
      <p>Klatt went on to say that LSU’s defensive struggles don’t mean for sure that they won’t win the national title. But as of now, they’re not as dominant on both sides of the ball as either Ohio State or Clemson.</p>
      <p>Is LSU’s defense the biggest thing holding them back from a potential national title?</p>
