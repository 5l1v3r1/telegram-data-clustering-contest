      <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips has urged <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> to sack <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> and says star players like <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pierre-emerick-aubameyang/">Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</a> will leave if the team continues to struggle under the manager.</p>
      <p>In Emery’s first season at the Emirates, Arsenal finished fifth in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> and lost the Europa League final to London rivals Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Arsenal are desperate to reclaim their place in the Champions League but already find themselves eight points adrift of the top-four having won just a third of their league games this term.</p>

      <p>The worrying run of form has sparked speculation over Emery’s future at Arsenal and former Premier League winner Wright-Phillips believes it is time for the Gunners to make a change.</p>
      <p>‘I think that it’s time for Emery to leave Arsenal, they’ve had a poor start to the season and I think something needs to change,’ the former Chelsea and Manchester City star told <a href="https://sports.sportingbet.com/en/sports/p/articles/shaun-wright-phillips-interview">Sportingbet</a>.</p>

      <p>‘My dad [Arsenal legend Ian Wright] is going to kill me for saying that, but he’s in the jungle so I should be safe!</p>
      <p>‘Growing up, Arsenal were always such a big team, they were dominant and would always give you a tough game.</p>
      <p>‘They seem to have lost something of that steel and it makes me sad to see, if I’m being honest. As well as the manager, there are deep issues that need to be addressed.</p>
      <p>‘Arsenal have been crying out for a defender for years, someone in the Tony Adams, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, even Ledley King mould who can shore up their defence.</p>

      <p>‘Their defensive signings haven’t addressed any of their issues but you wonder anyway if this type of defender would want to join Arsenal at the moment.</p>
      <p>‘They’re not close to winning anything and are going to struggle to keep hold of their best players, like Aubameyang who will want Champions League football, let alone sign new quality players.’</p>
      <p>Wright-Phillips also says former Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka was ‘wrong’ to clash with his own supporters during a Premier League match last month.</p>
      <p>Xhaka was stripped of the captain’s armband for clashing with Arsenal fans who greeted his substitution during the 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace with sarcastic cheers.</p>

      <p>‘Granit Xhaka was wrong to react in the way that he did, especially to his own fans,’ Wright-Phillips said.</p>
      <p>‘All players have bad games and abuse is part of the game – if you’re getting abuse from your own fans then you are clearly doing something wrong and it is down to you to correct it as a player.</p>
      <p>‘Xhaka should have ignored it but sometimes your emotions do get the better of you. One thing is for sure, it’s going to be difficult for him to come back from this.’</p>
