        <b>A rapper described as "a violent and controlling narcissist and a bully" imprisoned and repeatedly raped four young women, a court has heard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Andy Anokye, 32, who performs as Solo 45, denies 31 charges against him.</p>
      <p>They include 22 allegations of rape, five counts of false imprisonment, two of assault by penetration and two of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Christopher Quinlan told Bristol Crown Court the grime artist filmed some of his actions.</p>
      <p>"Each suffered in similar ways at different times at the defendant's hands," he added.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said the abuse took place over a two-year period. One of the women reported the abuse to friends and then to police, he said.</p>
      <h3>'Pain and suffering'</h3>
      <p>Mr Anokye was arrested and his mobile phone and laptop were seized by officers, who contacted three other women.</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said the musician had filmed "a great deal of what he did" on his phone.</p>
      <p>"He physically assaulted and falsely imprisoned them, held them against their will and he raped each of them repeatedly," he told the court.</p>
      <p>"He is a violent and controlling narcissist and a bully. He is a sadist who derives satisfaction and sexual pleasure from inflicting pain and suffering on his victims."</p>
      <p>Mr Quinlan said Mr Anokye, of Millennium Promenade, Bristol, will claim that any sexual activity between him and the women was consensual.</p>
      <p>Judge William Hart told jurors the defendant was a member of the grime collective, Boy Better Know.</p>
      <h3>'Skepta and Stormzy'</h3>
      <p>Mr Quinlan added Mr Anokye became known to each of the complainants through their "knowledge and taste" for grime music.</p>
      <p>He described the genre to the jury as "dance music influenced by garage music".</p>
      <p>"Artists of that genre include Skepta and Stormzy," he said.</p>
      <p>"Neither has anything to do with this case but you may hear reference to either or both of them during the evidence."</p>
      <p>The jury of five men and seven women have been told they will view some of the recordings made by Anokye.</p>
      <p>"You may find it both unpleasant and upsetting," Mr Quinlan said.</p>
      <p>"It is important evidence. We promise you that to show it is not gratuitous but necessary."</p>
      <p>The case continues.</p>
