      <p>Polyphony Digital have made a lot of announcements in the run up to the Gran Turismo Championship World Finals that will kick off tomorrow in Monaco.</p>

      <p>Lewis Hamilton will draw some headlines, entering into a Pro Am competition, where he’ll race with and against GT Competitors, guests and media. That will then be followed on Saturday and Sunday by the Manufacturer Series and Nations Cup Finals through elimination rounds.</p>
      <p>What will spice that up is that they will be racing at Laguna Seca Raceway, which will make its debut in GT Sport for the first time. The historic track has hosted everything from IndyCar and F1 to World Superbike, with its truly iconic Corkscrew S-curve. When the track will arrive for the main game and regular gamers, we don’t yet know, but you’ll be able to get a glimpse of it this weekend.</p>
      <p>The most recent track addition was the similarly iconic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/30/spa-francorchamps-gran-turismo-sports-1-47-update-october-taycan-porsche/">Spa-Francorchamps</a> which is located 40km Southeast of Liège, Eastern Belgium’s industrial city. It dropped into GT Sport a couple months after it was originally announced, so we might expect a similar delay for Laguna Seca.</p>
      <p>Alongside this, a new partnership has been struck with Mazda, who will unveil the Mazda RX-Vision GT3 Concept during the tournament, while Lamborghini’s Vision Gran Turismo full scale vehicle will also be unveiled. This was teased earlier this week.</p>
