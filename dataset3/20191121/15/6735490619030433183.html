      <p>Ahead of her upcoming performance at the 2019 American Music Awards, the Canadian singer spoke with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/21/shania-twain-american-music-awards-las-vegas-residency/4235988002/"><i>USA Today</i></a> and was asked about Swift’s claim last week that she was being barred from performing her older hits at the awards show.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know a lot about the details of that, but I’m a big supporter of Taylor,” Twin said. “I think she’s just incredibly brilliant. I haven’t had a chance to talk to her about it and I don’t really know where everybody is coming from, but I’ll always support the artist and their access to their own music. It seems a bit ridiculous to not have that.”</p>
      <p>Swift has since been granted permission to perform all of her songs for her AMAs medley.</p>

      <p>Twain also revealed her one wish for the AMAs: “I hope I get a hug in with Post Malone – that would be really great. Just a quick hug and ‘congratulations.’ I love him, and I’ve been such a big fan for a long time.”</p>
