      <h1>Woman in Peel calls 911 because she’s going to be late for a train</h1>

      <p>In the ongoing fight against people calling 911 for stupid reasons, Peel Regional Police have released audio of a woman calling 911 to ask for a police emergency run so her taxi could reach the train station on time.</p>
      <p>“Just in terms of an officer – I am supposed to have a trip to Union Station’ the woman tells the dispatcher. “The ride that was supposed to show for me this morning did not. I don’t know how you guys work with services in terms of that.”</p>
      <p>She says that she’s gotten a cab but will likely be late.</p>
      <p>“What would you like an officer to do,” the dispatcher replies.</p>
      <p>“Do you guys offer emergency ride services or not?”</p>
      <p>There’s a pause of incredulity, and then the dispatcher replies.</p>
      <p>“I can assure you we don’t do that."</p>
