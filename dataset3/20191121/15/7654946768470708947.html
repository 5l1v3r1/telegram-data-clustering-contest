      <p>President Trump cast doubt on testimony from a top US diplomat in Ukraine on Thursday — by bringing up his own “great” hearing when it comes to listening to phone calls.</p>
      <p>“I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life. My hearing is, and has been, great,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197521967777222656">Trump tweeted.</a></p>
      <p>“Never have I been watching a person making a call, which was not on speakerphone, and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I’ve even tried, but to no avail. Try it live!”</p>
      <p>Trump appeared to be responding to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/21/trump-impeachment-hearings-fiona-hill-and-david-holmes-testify-on-capitol-hill/">testimony from David Holmes</a>, as the career diplomat testified before lawmakers about a July 26 phone call between European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland and Trump-related to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>In testimony before the House Intelligence Committee in the ongoing impeachment inquiry, Holmes recalled sitting across the table from Sondland at a restaurant, following Sondland’s private meeting with Zelensky.</p>
      <p>Sondland had called Trump afterward — and the two discussed Zelensky agreeing to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter.</p>
      <p>“Although Ambassador Sondland’s phone was not on speakerphone, I could hear the president’s voice through the earpiece of the phone,” said Holmes.</p>
      <p>Holmes continued, “I heard President Trump then clarify that Ambassador Sondland was in Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland replied, yes, he was in Ukraine, and went on to state that President Zelensky ‘loves your ass.’ I then heard President Trump ask, ‘So, he’s gonna do the investigation?’ Ambassador Sondland replied that ‘he’s gonna do it,’ adding that President Zelensky will do “anything you ask him to.”</p>
