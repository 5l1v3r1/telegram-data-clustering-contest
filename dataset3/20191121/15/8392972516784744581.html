      <h2>That Jane McDonald picture has a lot to answer for!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:55:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:55</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Adele Roberts could have ruined Roman Kemp's career by accusing him of prejudice on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a>, according to Vicky Pattison.</p>
      <p>The reality star, 32, warned that words like "prejudice" shouldn't be used "recklessly", especially when there are millions of people watching.</p>
      <p>In a conversation with <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10383349/im-a-celeb-roman-kemp-adele-argue-jane-mcdonald-picture/">The Sun</a>, Vicky addressed the moment, earlier this week, when the former Big Brother housemate <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-roman-kemp-and-adele-roberts-spat-over-jane-mcdonald/">took issue with DJ Roman insisting it was "random"</a> to bring a photo of singer Jane McDonald into the jungle.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Vicky, who won the series in 2015, told the publication: "Words like 'prejudice' shouldn't be thrown around recklessly in any environment — certainly not the jungle where there are around 10million people hanging on your every word.</p>
      <p>"A harmless joke could have been blown all out of proportion and had a very detrimental effect on Roman's career."</p>

      <p>Roman and Adele got into an argument over Jane McDonald after she chose to bring a pic of the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> star as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>It started when <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">GMB</a> host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> asked: "Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?"</p>
      <p>Radio 1 DJ Adele confessed: "I know her off Loose Women, I don't know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers."</p>
      <aside>Words like 'prejudice' shouldn't be thrown around recklessly.</aside>
      <p>But she got upset when Roman and Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson began to laugh and claimed "no-one knows" who Jane is, with Roman telling his campmates: "It’s just random."</p>
      <p>Adele hit back: "Why though? I don't understand. If I had brought in a picture of Ru-Paul would you have the same reaction?</p>
      <p>"That's prejudice, I'm allowed to like what I want."</p>

      <p>After the spat, some viewers predicted that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-predict-adele-roberts-will-be-first-to-leave-after-clash-with-roman-kemp/">Adele will be the first celebrity to be voted off</a> the show.</p>
      <p>Adele's girlfriend has since set the record straight and explained exactly why she chose to take a picture of Jane.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Actress Kate Holderness wrote on Twitter: "Hahaaaa! Right, I can clear this up! All the campmates have to have different luxury items, they're not allowed to double up on anything."</p>
      <p>She went on to explain that Adele's first choices, a family photo and a pillow, were already taken. But her radio listeners often request "a bit of Jane" when they're having a slump or feeling low, so Adele <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/why-adele-roberts-has-a-pic-of-jane-mcdonald/">wanted to bring the same inspirational vibes into the jungle</a>.</p>
