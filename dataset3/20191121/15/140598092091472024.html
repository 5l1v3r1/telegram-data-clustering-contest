      <h1>Tories launch spoof website claiming to show Labour manifesto</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:32:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/hasan-chowdhury/" target="_blank">Hasan Chowdhury</a></address>
      <p>A website claiming to reveal the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/11/21/general-election-brexit-news-labour-manifesto-corbyn-latest/">Labour Party’s manifesto</a> has been created by the Conservatives, with paid-for-ads of the page appearing at the top of Google search results for the opposition. </p>
      <p>Dubbed “Labour’s 2019 Manifesto”, the website registered to the domain <a href="https://www.labourmanifesto.co.uk/">labourmanifesto.co.uk </a>makes a scathing attack on Jeremy Corbyn, whose party launched its <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/23/inside-labours-bid-install-corbyn-number-10-using-social-media/">plan to “transform” the country</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn claimed the Labour manifesto is “full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation”, such as an £11bn windfall tax on oil and gas companies.</p>
      <p>But the website claims the opposition leader will “dither and delay for months and months” on Brexit, while hiking up taxes and dragging the country into further votes on the European Union and Scottish Independence.</p>
      <p>“All you need to know about Labour’s 2019 manifesto is that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/10/23/inside-labours-bid-install-corbyn-number-10-using-social-media/">Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister</a> means higher taxes for you and your family, the chaos of two more referendums and more indecision and delay on Brexit,” the website says. </p>
      <p>A link on the page that claims to offer “more information on Labour's second Brexit referendum” redirects to a post on the Tories’ website on “Labour’s Brexit Chaos”. It says it is promoted by Alan Mabbutt, a board member of the Conservative Party. </p>
      <p>It comes just days after the Conservative Campaign Headquarters Twitter account dressed up its social media page as a <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/20/twitter-accuses-conservatives-misleading-voters-posing-fact/">fact-checking service</a> during a televised debate between Boris Johnson and Mr Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The efforts to attack Labour online have drawn <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/20/really-behind-tories-deceitful-twitter-fact-check-ploy-did/">sharp criticism</a>, with Twitter claiming that “any further attempts to mislead people” would lead to it taking “decisive corrective action” in the future. </p>
      <p>Some Twitter users took to the social media service to criticise the Labour Manifesto page made by the Tories. One user tweeted: "The more I see Tory propaganda like this, the more I'm incentivised to #VoteLabour on 12/12/19”.</p>
      <p>The ads campaign on Google comes less than a day after the search giant said it would tighten its policies on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/11/21/google-races-crack-political-adverts-ahead-uk-general-election/">political ads targeting</a> and clamp down on “demonstrably false claims”. </p>
      <p>Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Conservative Party’s Labour Manifesto page.</p>
