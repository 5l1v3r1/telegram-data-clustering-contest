      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:42:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> has been snubbed by her daughters as they remain completely silent on her jungle adventures.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn has quickly established herself as a fan favourite and one of the most popular celebs among the other big names in camp.</p>
      <p>Remaining silent on her foray into the jungle are her daughters, Kendall and Kylie.</p>
      <p>The super model and the cosmetics guru are heavily active on social media - their <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> accounts have a combined following of nearly 270 million followers.</p>
      <p>But they've kept their silence so far on Caitlyn's endeavours - their mum Kris and Caitlyn's ex wife Kris has also kept her mouth shut.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, Caitlyn fans aren't happy.</p>

      <p>"Be really nice of the Kardashian/Jenner clan to take some time out and send just one message of support to Caitlyn #ImACeleb," one penned.</p>
      <p>Another queried: "Why hasn't Kylie or Kendall or any of the Kardashians tweeted about Caitlyn in the jungle?"</p>
      <p>A third raged: "Cannot deal with how tamping I am that Kylie and Kendall haven't posted s**t about Caitlyn going into the jungle when you know she'll be dying for them to be watching, dunno why I'm bothered but I am."</p>
      <p>Others couldn't help but crack the joke that Kendall and Kylie might be waiting for Caitlyn on the other side of the bridge when she gets out of the jungle.</p>

      <p>One laughed: "Really wondering who is gunna be on the other side of the bridge when Caitlyn comes out of the jungle? Like are Kylie and Kendall going to be waiting next to Ant and Dec with open arms? I think not."</p>
      <p>Another chuckled: "Scenes on I'm A Celeb when Caitlyn Jenner is voted out and is met by Kris, Kendall and Kylie on the bridge being told to stand on a gold star."</p>
      <p>Another wanted to see camp mate Jacqueline Jossa - who's a huge Kardashian fan - get to meet her idols.</p>

      <p>They wrote: "I wonder, if Caitlyn Jenner is still in #ImACeleb when it comes to friends or relatives going in, if Kylie or Kim or Kendall will be the ones to go in. Gosh imagine Jacqueline's reaction."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn's made waves in camp with her honesty, candour and no nonsense approach to the gruelling trials and life in the jungle.</p>
      <p>The series' first trial, Bugged Off, saw Caitlyn - along with Good Morning Britain's Kate Garraway - suspended in a see-through box and surrounded by tens of thousands of creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>She got a cockroach in her ear, calling for Medic Bob to rush in and remove the critter.</p>
      <p>"They needed an American to come in and save the day," she joked before the trial, "I feel the weight of this entire country on my shoulders."</p>
