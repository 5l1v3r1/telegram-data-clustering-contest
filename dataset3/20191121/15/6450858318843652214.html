      <p>Gaming has come a long way in the past 30 years; as well as a general improvement in gameplay, graphics and just about everything else, gaming, in general, is more accepted than it once was. While it was once hard to imagine celebrities endorsing and playing games, it’s now easy to find celebrities like Drake playing games and even streaming online.</p>
      <p>As gaming becomes more popular, more people define themselves as gamers. While that’s well and good if you’re in the gaming community, it may be a bit difficult for those that don’t <i>get</i> games to buy game-related gifts for birthdays, Christmas and other events.</p>
      <p>Fear not; with Christmas fast approaching, we at Tech Advisor have listed some of the top gifts for gamers, helping you find the perfect present for the gamer in your life.</p>
      <p>If you're on the hunt for a real bargain, take a look at our selection of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/deals/games/">best game deals</a> and other <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/deals/">tech deals</a> in general. </p>

        <h3>Logitech G915</h3>

        </ul>
        <p>For PC gamers, a dedicated gaming keyboard can make the difference between winning and losing, and amongst the best on the market is the Logitech G915. Released earlier this year, the company’s latest keyboard offers mechanical performance in an impressively slimline 22mm thick form factor.</p>
        <p>It uses premium materials like 5052 aluminium alloy and steel to provide a durable, clean look, and the new low-profile CHOC GL switches are an absolute dream to type on, whether you’re shooting aliens or typing up a work document.</p>
        <p>But with all the high-end materials and impressive features available, it’s definitely not the cheapest gaming keyboard on the market, so take a look at our selection of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/game/best-gaming-keyboards-3642672/">best gaming keyboards</a> for more inspiration.</p>

          <h3>Razer Naga Trinity</h3>

          </ul>
          <p>While some gamers can live without a mechanical keyboard for gaming, it’ll be hard to find a PC gamer that doesn’t use a gaming mouse when playing the likes of CoD, Battlefield and Fortnite. And when it comes to gaming accessories, few manufacturers provide better quality products than Razer.</p>
          <p>We recommend the Razer Naga Trinity because it features an interchangeable side plate mechanism and includes 2-, 7- and 12-button plates in the box. This provides the ability to quickly switch between side plates depending on the type of game that you’re playing, and gives you quick access to a range of macro settings at your fingertips.</p>
          <p>If the Naga Trinity looks a little hardcore, take a look at our selection of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/pc-peripheral/best-gaming-mouse-3644972/">best gaming mice</a> for more inspiration.</p>

            <h3>Turtle Beach Atlas Aero</h3>

            </ul>
            <p>You can’t underestimate the edge that a great gaming headset can provide, especially in first-person shooters where every second counts. What’s better than a gaming headset? A wireless gaming headset, of course, and the Atlas Aero walks the impressive line of offering a great experience without an expensive price tag.</p>
            <p>The Atlas Aero features Waves Nx 3D Audio, powered by the company’s Control Studio software, which does an incredible job at producing directional audio to help immerse you in the game. Couple that with a premium design, wireless connectivity, a custom EQ, 30 hours of battery life and beautifully soft earcups and you’ve got the perfect gaming headset for the gamer in your life.</p>

              <h3>Secretlab Titan (2020)</h3>
              <figure>

              <p>No matter if you’re a PC or console gamer, you need a comfortable chair to sit in during those long gaming sessions. It can’t just be a bog-standard chair either; gaming chairs have been designed to support your back, keeping your posture straight whether you’re slaying vampires or driving a tank through abandoned buildings.</p>
              <p>In our mind, one of the best gaming chairs currently available is the Secretlab Titan 2020. It’s the largest in the company’s collection, and features a tall backrest, wide seatbase and, rather impressively, built-in adjustable lumbar support. It’s made from cold-cure foam that provides soft cushioning and moulds to the shape of your body, and is wrapped in high-end PU leather for a nice soft-touch finish.</p>

                  <li><b>RRP: </b>64GB £399 | 128GB £499</li>

                <p>VR is the next big thing in the gaming market; following the release of decent first-gen headsets over the past couple of years, big VR players like Oculus and Vive have released impressive follow-ups that enhance the virtual experience even further.</p>
                <p>We love the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/vr/oculus-quest-3697159/">Oculus Quest</a> for one simple reason: you don’t need a PC to use it. But unlike the Oculus Go, which is limited to entertainment and social apps, you’ll be able to play fully-fledged Rift games. It offers inside-out tracking, negating the need for base stations, and the handheld controllers are perfectly tracked.</p>
                <p>What’s more is that you can now use the Oculus Quest with a PC (via USB-C cable) to access PC-only VR content, and as of 2020, you’ll be able to ditch the controllers and use your hands to interact with the virtual world. If there’s any VR headset on the market you should be considering, it’s this one.</p>
                <p>If VR is an area of interest, we’d recommend taking a look at our selection of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/gadget/best-vr-headsets-3634668/">best VR headsets</a> – complete with buying advice for first-time users. </p>

                  <h3>Nintendo Switch Lite</h3>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3680421/nintendo_switch_lite_review_4_thumb800.jpg"/>

                  <ul>
                    <li><b>RRP: </b>£199</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>While just about everyone who wants a Nintendo Switch has one at this stage, the Switch Lite is still relatively new to the market following a September 2019 launch. The Switch Lite is a cheaper, handheld-only version of the Switch designed for on-the-go use.</p>
                  <p>There are some limitations to the console, like the always-attached JoyCons and the lack of TV output, but the small form factor should make it easier to carry around than the standard Switch console.</p>
                  <p>Take a look at our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/gaming/nintendo-switch-lite-3702668/">Nintendo Switch Lite review</a> for more information, and keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/game/best-nintendo-switch-deals-3664920/">best Nintendo Switch deals</a> to get a discount on the handheld console.</p>

                    <h3>Venom Power Pack and Stand</h3>
                    <figure>
                      <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3680421/venom_power_pack_thumb800.jpg"/>
                    </figure>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>RRP: </b>£20.99</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The Nintendo Switch is a great hybrid console that allows you to play the likes of Zelda, Pokemon and Fortnite both at home and while out and about. The issue with portable tech, like with tablets, smartphones and almost anything else you can think about, is battery life. The Nintendo Switch can offer around five hours of battery on a charge, but this drops depending on the graphical power of the game in question.</p>
                    <p>To remedy this, we suggest the Venom Power Pack and Stand. The battery pack clips directly onto the body of the Nintendo Switch, providing an extra 10,000mAh of power – more than enough for long journeys, and even some long-haul flights! The stand on the rear battery pack is also much sturdier than the built-in stand, offering a more solid tabletop experience with less of a risk of falling.</p>
