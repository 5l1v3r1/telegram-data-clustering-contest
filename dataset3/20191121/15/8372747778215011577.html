      <p>New Yorkers are used to strange subway sites, <a href="https://pix11.com/2019/11/20/dont-worry-this-subway-entrance-was-flooded-on-purpose/">but this one</a> had one person demanding an explanation from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.</p>
      <p>A tweeted photo shows a Broadway Station entrance filled with water. There are three entrances at the station and only one was tested, a spokesperson for MTA said.</p>
      <p>The agency plans on re-opening the entrance Thursday.</p>
      <p>And no, the MTA is not " <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/1197287790779752448">pivoting to submarines,"</a> despite their first response to the tweet.</p>
      <p>The MTA was testing a new flex gate. It’s a flood barrier that would allow the agency to seal off a subway entrance. The test lasted four hours so the MTA could make sure the flex gate was installed correctly (it was.)</p>
      <p>“We’re doing this because climate change is real,” <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/1197288322646839297">NYCT subway tweeted.</a> “We’re <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/1197293879801896962">investing in capital projects</a> around the system to prepare for the impacts of a changing climate.”</p>
