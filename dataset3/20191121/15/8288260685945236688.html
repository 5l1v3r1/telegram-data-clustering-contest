      <p>Metal detectorists George Powell and Layton Davies have been convicted at Worcester Crown Court of stealing a £3 million hoard of Viking coins and jewellery - much of which is still missing.</p>
      <p>Both men were found guilty of the theft after failing to declare the "invaluable" collection of buried treasure dating back 1,100 years to the reign of King Alfred the Great, then conspiring to sell it on.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors had alleged the items, typical of a Viking hoard burial from the Anglo-Saxon period, were dug up on Herefordshire farmland on June 2 2015.</p>
      <p>Only some jewellery items and 31 of the coins have been recovered, although mobile phone photographs - later deleted, but recovered by police - showed the larger hoard, still intact, in a freshly dug hole.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Powell and Davies were also convicted alongside two other men, 60-year-old Paul Wells and Simon Wicks, 57, with conspiring to conceal the find.</p>
      <p>Wicks, Powell and Davies were also found guilty of converting their ill-gotten gains into cash, after police traced several coins that had been sold on to private collectors, hidden away, or left with expert valuers.</p>
      <p>Five of the coins were found stitched into the leather case of a magnifying glass and later volunteered to officers by Wells when they turned up at his home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Expert analysis of all the jewellery and coinage recovered to date and now held at the British Museum, returned a valuation of at least £581,000.</p>
      <p>As to the fate of the rest of the coins and items in the hoard, prosecuting barrister Kevin Hegarty QC told jurors: "They have not been found.</p>
      <p>"They must be concealed in one or more places or by now having been concealed have been dispersed never to be reassembled as a hoard of such coinage again."</p>
