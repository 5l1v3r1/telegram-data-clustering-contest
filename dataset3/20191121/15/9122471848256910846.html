      <h1>Report: Nike Is Releasing A Colin Kaepernick Signature Shoe In December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:30:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick doesn’t appear to be any closer to an NFL return than he was before his highly-publicized workout in Atlanta last weekend. The quarterback is reportedly close to some big news with Nike, though.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nikes-value-is-up-262-b-since-colin-kaepernick-endorsement-now-its-close-to-unveiling-his-shoe-150012824.html">Yahoo! Sports is reporting</a> that Nike is set to unveil a Colin Kaepernick signature shoe in December.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick, 32, signed an endorsement deal with Nike a little more than a year ago. A signature shoe was reportedly a part of that deal.</p>
      <p>The shoe will reportedly be released next month in a nationwide release.</p>
      <blockquote>The inclusion of a shoe and a Kaepernick branded “Icon” jersey was first reported by Yahoo Sports in 2018, with his footwear rollout speculated to be on track for the 2019 holiday season. Sources told Yahoo this week that Nike is expecting a nationwide release of the shoe early next month as it continues to develop the company’s endorsement strategy around Kaepernick.<br/><br/>Although the total number of Icon jerseys sold by Nike is unknown, the February online release of that item sold out in a matter of hours. Priced at $150 upon release, the authentic versions of the Nike jersey now sell on the secondary market for $300 or more. Counterfeit versions of the jersey have also spread across secondary clothing sites for $50 or more.</blockquote>
      <p>Kaepernick’s deal with Nike was criticized by many at the time, but it doesn’t appear to have done anything to hurt the iconic brand. At least, the numbers don’t reflect anything of the sort.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t look like the release of his shoe will be paired with a return to the NFL, though the quarterback remains interested in playing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready. I’m staying ready. And I’ll continue to be ready. To all the people that came out today to support, I appreciate y’all, I love y’all. To the people that aren’t here, I’m thinking of you, I appreciate you supporting from where you are. We’ll continue to give you updates as we hear. We’ll be waiting to hear from Roger Goodell, the NFL, 32 teams. We’ll let you know if we hear from them,” he said after his workout.</p>
      <p>“The ball’s in their court. We’re ready to go.’</p>
