      <h1>Noel McNamara staying on as Ireland under-20 head-coach</h1>

        <b>Noel McNamara has confirmed that he'll continue on as the head-coach of the Irish under-20 team for 2020, despite taking on the role of academy manager at Leinster. </b>
      </p>
      <p>He oversaw Ireland's Grand Slam success in last season's Six Nations and saw his injury-hit side finish eighth at the IRB World Rugby Championship before being appointed by Leinster.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very exciting time,” <a href="https://www.irishrugby.ie/2019/11/21/mcnamara-excited-for-third-season-in-charge-of-ireland-under-20s/">McNamara told IrishRugby.ie </a>ahead of his third campaign in charge of the Ireland 20s.</p>
      <p>“Any opportunity you get to work with a national team, particularly young players, it’s always something that should be relished with great enthusiasm.</p>
      <p>“This is our first time being based in the Sport Ireland Campus and I think it’s fair to say it’s a world-class facility and a huge addition to these players’ development and the player pathway. It’s just great to get started.”</p>
      <p>He's also happy to juggle his two jobs in the coming months:</p>
      <p>“There is obviously an overlap between the two and ultimately I think it’s an advantage being involved in the system and getting the opportunity to work with a national side and bench mark players against the best in the world.</p>
      <p>“We’re really looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead.”</p>
