      <h1>Likely Giroud departure means it’s make or break time for Batshuayi at Chelsea</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:57:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Phillips</a></address>
      <p>Michy Batshuayi’s Chelsea career has been nothing short of stuttering since arriving from Marseille in 2016.</p>
      <p>The 26-year old has failed to nail down a regular starting place at the club and as a result, has spent time away on loan at Borussia Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The love-able character has once again started the season at Chelsea in an attempt to win over yet another manager in the shape of Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>But due to the form of Tammy Abraham, Batshuayi has once again had to put up with just a bench role, and hasn’t really been used for much rotation just yet.</p>
      <p>His attitude has been great throughout though, and once again this season his mentality is on point.</p>
      <p>He has vowed just this week to stay at Chelsea this season and fight for his place, as reported by <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7695965/Michy-Batshuayi-insists-stay-Blues-despite-not-regular-Frank-Lampard.html">The Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>This is an admirable attitude and it is the start of him making his last push to make it as a Chelsea player.</p>
      <p>This remainder of the season will be his make or break. If it gets to the summer and he still hasn’t got more than just a squad role, he will almost certainly be joining a new club in the summer on a permanent deal.</p>
      <p>His chances will be helped by the likely departure of Olivier Giroud in January.</p>

      <p>Chelsea are unlikely to replace Giroud in January, whether they are transfer banned or not, so this naturally will increase Batshauyi’s chances of game time.</p>
      <p>Factor in fatigue as the season draws on as well, Abraham will probably be rotated a little more, and with the only option coming in being Batshuayi, he will have more chances to prove his worth at the club.</p>
      <p>He’s a great personality to have around the club and he has shown signs of brilliance, yet never really convinced anyone enough to prove he should be a regular starter. This is his final shot.</p>
