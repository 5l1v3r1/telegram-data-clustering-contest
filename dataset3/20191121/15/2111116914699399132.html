      <h3>Best WordPress hosting 2019</h3>
      <p>Need a cheap, shared WordPress plan? Start here...</p>
      <p>Image Credit: WordPress</p>
      <p>Getting started with WordPress <a href="https://www.techradar.com/web-hosting/best-web-hosting-service-websites">web hosting</a> doesn't have to be expensive, after all the 15-year old WordPress is free (and open source). Even the cheapest shared hosting plan usually comes with a one-click WordPress installer, allowing the greenest of blogging newbies to have their first post ready in less than 60 seconds (we tried it).</p>
      <p>Managing a blog over time is much more challenging, though. You'll need to find your own themes and plugins. And also keep them, and WordPress itself, up-to-date (although you can even get that done automatically).</p>
      <p>Blogs are often targeted by malware, so it's important you have some way to detect and remove any threats, and you'll want regular backups to help get a broken blog working again. </p>
      <p>There's a long list of hosting companies offering WordPress plans, but we've picked out five of the best to point you in the right direction. Whether you're a first-time user or a big business, there's something for you here, and with prices starting at around a pound per month, it's well worth taking the time to find out more.</p>

      <p>+ Optimized low-level setup<br/>+ Many powerful extras in WP Pro plans</p>
      <p>Budget WordPress hosting can have a lot of appeal, but it usually won't deliver the features, performance or reliability that high traffic sites need. If you're the demanding type, opting for a premium hosting plan will give you much better results.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdUsuuYBKWwyVPfQ82BFbP.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Bluehost has created its own VPS-based architecture to deliver optimum WordPress performance via NGINX, a custom PHP-FPM setup and intelligently allocated resources through KVM hypervisor. (If you're not a hosting geek, this just means Bluehost has taken the time to optimize the low-level setup of its platform for WordPress, rather than simply making do with a standard configuration.)</p>
      <p>The company doesn't waste time by pretending to offer ‘unlimited’ resources, and instead tells you exactly what you're going to get. For the Basic plan which starts at $2.75 per month for the first term (renews at $7.99), this means 50GB SSD storage, a single website, a free domain for one year and $50 Marketing Credit.</p>
      <p>Additional features for all plans include free SSL, unmetered MySQL DB, site analytics dashboard, unlimited parked/sub domains and Bluehost Marketplace where users will have access to premium themes and plugins at exclusive prices<a href="https://www.bluehost.com/track/techradar?page=/special/wordpress">.</a> New Bluehost accounts will also get a free service called Blue Spark, which is designed to help newcomers with everything WordPress related.</p>
      <p>The Plus plan which starts at $5.45 per month for the first term (renews at $10.99), adds unlimited websites and website space, and additional features like spam protection, free CDN and WP staging environment. The Choice Plus plan costs $5.45 per month for the first term (renews at $14.99) and adds even more features. Bluehost also offers a 30-day money-back guarantee if you feel the service doesn't deliver. </p>
      <p>If you need more power, BlueHost has a managed hosting solution called WordPress Pro that has been optimized for WordPress websites, with prices starting at $17.95 per month. These plans have many additional features like unlimited everything, malware detection and removal, JetPack site analytics, business review tools and more.</p>

      <h4>2. Tsohost</h4>
      <p>Best for UK customers</p>
      <aside>TSOHost Startup$5/mthTSOHost Business$12/mthTSOHost Ecommerce$34/mthVisit Siteat TSOHost</aside>
      <p>+ Great value pricing<br/>+ 24/7 support on basic plan<br/>- Not much in the way of extras</p>
      <p>Managed WordPress packages can often feel overpriced. Many hosts charge significant premiums for impressive sounding claims – optimized servers, malware scanning – that are difficult to evaluate or confirm.</p>
      <p>The UK-based Tsohost isn't interested in any of that, instead focusing on providing the core WordPress essentials at a very fair price.</p>
      <p>The baseline Startup plan gives you a free domain name, will migrate your existing site, includes Let's Encrypt SSL support and has no limits on bandwidth. You get daily backups and can restore any of the last 30 days with a click. There's 24/7 support via ticket and email, and phone and live chat is available from 7am to midnight.</p>
      <p>You get a hundred 200MB mailboxes, and the plan restricts you to 15GB storage and 100,000 page views a month. If that's enough for you, the plan costs ~$4.15(£3.16) a month paid annually, or ~$3.8(£2.92) if you pay for two years upfront. At the moment, you can get the first year for $15.4(£12)</p>
      <p>If that's just too underpowered, opting for the Business plan gets you 50GB of storage, 100x1GB mailboxes, and up to 500,000 page views over a maximum of eight websites. That's significantly more capable, yet still very reasonably priced at ~$11.50(£8.78) a month, ~$9.62(£7.33) a month paid annually or ~$8.65(£6.59) a month paid biennially. At the moment, you can get the first year for $32(£25)</p>
      <p>The  ~$31.50(£23.98) a month (~$26.20 a month paid annually or ~$23.60 a month paid biennially) eCommerce plan supports 100GB storage, 1,000,000 page views and unlimited 10GB mailboxes. At the moment, you can get the first year for $77(£60)</p>
      <p>Tsohost doesn't offer all the frills and extras you'll get with some products. There's no talk of SiteLock malware protection, optimized WordPress add-ons or a custom CDN. But it's hard to complain at this price, and Tsohost is still delivering a capable service with more than enough power for smaller sites.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>3. InMotion Hosting</h4>
      <p>Best host for choice of plans</p>
      <aside>InMotion WP-1000S$4.99/mthInMotion WP-2000S$8.99/mthInMotion WP-3000S$11.99/mthVisit Siteat InMotion Hosting</aside>
      <p>+ Low-end plans have key features<br/>+ Reliable hosting provider<br/>- Not the cheapest host</p>
      <p>Most web hosts offer only a few WordPress plans, and even these might be set up to point you in a particular direction. You'll often see an underpowered plan, an overpriced one, and a special deal on the mid-range plan they really want you to buy. That makes it easy to decide, but it also limits your upgrade options if your site grows over time.</p>
      <p>InMotion Hosting is unusual in offering six WordPress plans, covering everything from small personal blogs to resellers and big business. Figuring out which is the best product for you will take a little more thought, but at least there's room to upgrade – or downgrade – if your circumstances change.</p>
      <p>Better still, InMotion hasn't artificially limited the low-end plans by removing key features. Even the baseline WP-1000S plan – which costs $6.99 (£5.3) a month initially (1-year plan), $9.99 (£7.70) on renewal – gives you 40GB storage, unlimited bandwidth and email addresses, preinstalled WordPress, SSL, backups, automatic updates, SiteLock security, cPanel site management, and extras like BoldGrid and WP-CLI. The only significant issue is InMotion's suggestion that the plan works best for blogs with up to 20,000 monthly visits, and even that won't be a problem for many smaller sites.</p>
      <p>Upgrading your plan gets you some extras – premium themes and plugin subscriptions, a dedicated IP address, support for hosting more sites – but it's mostly about giving you more resources. For example, the top-of-the-range WP-6000S plan supports 1,200,000 monthly visitors across up to 20 sites for $114.99 (£87.6) a month initially (1-year plan), $142.99 (£110) on renewal.</p>
      <p>There are cheaper deals around, but in previous reviews we've found InMotion to be reliable, professional and honest, and any price premium is likely to be worth paying. You don't have to take our word for it, though – an exceptional 90-day money-back guarantee gives you plenty of opportunity to find out for yourself.</p>

      <h4>4. 1&amp;1 IONOS</h4>
      <p>Best host for the novice</p>
      <p>+ Very tempting price for six months<br/>+ SSL and free domain<br/>+ 24/7 support including phone</p>
      <p>Web giant 1&amp;1 IONOS seems to have a hosting product for every possible need, and WordPress is no exception. Novice users can try out its service for a nominal $1(£0.75) a month for the first year ($9 or £6.90 afterwards), yet the plan still outperforms many competitors. </p>
      <p>The bundled 25GB of storage means you won't be running out of space in a hurry, for example. There are no bandwidth or visitor limits, and you can set up as many email accounts as you need.</p>
      <p>1&amp;1 IONOS offers the core WordPress management functions that you would expect: a setup wizard, preinstalled plugins, automatic updates and 24/7 support (including by telephone). Also, you get a personal consultant free of charge. </p>
      <p>All this is built on a capable platform – NGINX, PHP 7.2, OPcache, up to 2GB RAM guaranteed – to enhance your blog's performance.</p>
      <p>There's SSL included and even a free domain thrown in, which is ridiculously good value at this price.</p>
      <p>If you're a WordPress novice, it might be worth taking out the plan for an initial year, claiming your free domain and taking the time to learn how the blog works. When you time is up, renew if you're happy, or if you're not, use your knowledge and experience to find a better plan.</p>
      <p>1&amp;1 IONOS isn't just about newbies, though: there's value for more demanding users, too. In particular, the Pro plan gives you 5 managed Wordpress sites, 200GB SSD storage space, 50 databases (1GB max), and 500 email accounts. Bonus features include a CDN and SiteLock malware scanning, as well as RailGun content delivery network, and the price looks good at $1(£0.75)  a month for the first year, $15(£11.50)  on renewal.</p>

      <p>+ Free site migration<br/>+ Automatic malware detection and removal<br/>+ CDN benefits</p>
      <p>Choosing the best WordPress hosting package can seem like a complicated business, with a stack of low-level details and issues to consider. But it doesn't have to be that way. If you don't have special requirements then opting for a reliable company will get you capable mid-range products that can handle everything most users need.</p>
      <p>HostGator generally delivers powerful hosting plans for a fair price, and its managed WordPress range is no exception. Its Starter product may only cost $5.95 (£4.25) ($3.98 with our promo code) per month for three years, $9.95 (£7.10) afterwards, but you still get a free site migration, an SSL certificate, automatic malware detection and removal, unlimited email addresses and unmetered storage and bandwidth, and it can handle up to 100,000 visits a month.</p>
      <p>Ramping up to the high-end Business plan gets you more CPU power, support for up to three sites and 500,000 visits a month, yet still costs only $9.95 (£7.10) ($9.18 with our promo code) a month for the first three years, $22.95 (£16.40) a month afterwards.</p>
      <p>Smart caching and a CDN are on hand to enhance your website's performance, 24/7 support helps keep your site up and running, and surprise bonus features include free domain privacy to protect from identity theft and reduce annoying spam.</p>
      <p>We've had good experiences with HostGator's service, but if you're not so lucky, there's a generous 45-day money-back guarantee. As with other hosting companies, this won't cover any domain registration fees, but it's still a better deal than you'll often find elsewhere.</p>

      <h4>How to choose a WordPress hosting provider?</h4>
      <p>If you don't have the time or technical experience for all that, you might prefer to buy a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-managed-wordpress-hosting"><u>managed WordPress hosting</u></a> plan, and have the hosting company handle all the technical bits for you.</p>
      <p>The host will often import your previous WordPress blog, if you have one. Usually you'll get some preinstalled themes and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/best/best-wordpress-plugins"><u>plugins</u></a> to simplify customization. </p>
      <p>There should at least be an option to automatically update the site, a security service like SiteLock will be on hand to keep your blog malware-free, and we would expect 24/7 support from a team with real WordPress knowledge.</p>
      <p>The best hosts go even further, optimizing their servers to boost WordPress performance, and sometimes throwing in extras like a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-cdns-of-2018"><u>content delivery network</u></a> (CDN) to deliver great speeds worldwide (hopefully).</p>
