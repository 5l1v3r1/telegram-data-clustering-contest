      <h1>G Suite users get basic Google Assistant voice commands for Gmail and Google Calendar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/joefedewa/" target="_blank">Joe Fedewa</a></address>
      <p>People who regularly use G Suite accounts often complain about the lack of features compared to regular Google accounts. The company has slowly been fixing this as of late with a <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-cloud-next-2019-announcements/">bunch of features added back in April</a>. Now, Google is finally allowing G Suite accounts to use <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/google-assistant/">Google Assistant</a> voice commands for Gmail and Google Calendar.</p>
      <p>Google Assistant’s voice commands for G Suite users are pretty basic at the moment. Here’s what you can do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Let you know when your next meeting is</li>
        <li>Create, cancel or reschedule a Calendar event</li>
        <li>Send a note to event attendees via email</li>
        <li>Send an email</li>
        <li>Dial into a meeting</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Google Assistant will only work with one account at a time. You’ll have to switch between accounts if you’re signed into a personal Google account and a G Suite account. To use these commands you will first have to apply to use them. Right now, the feature is in beta and not enabled by default. That means if you’re not an admin you’ll have to convince the higher-ups to apply.
