      <p>Russia adopted an initial foreign agent law in 2012 which gave the authorities the power to label non-governmental organizations and human rights groups foreign agents.</p>
      <p>The legislation that was approved on Thursday, and which now goes to the upper house and then President Vladimir Putin for approval, extends the legislation to cover individuals.</p>
      <p>If Putin signs off on the legislation, all material published by an individual who receives money from abroad will be labeled as having been distributed by a foreign agent. Also, any individual who distributes foreign media could be labeled a foreign agent.</p>
      <p>New-York based Human Rights Watch said the draft legislation was a “further step to restrict free and independent media” in Russia that would affect journalists and bloggers.</p>
      <p>Harlem Desir, media freedom chief for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), has called on Russian lawmakers to abandon the law.</p>
      <p>“It may have a considerable chilling effect on journalists, as well as on bloggers, experts, or other individuals publishing information, particularly online,” he said on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The 2012 foreign agent law required groups covered by the legislation to submit regular reports on their funding, objectives, spending and who their managers are.</p>
      <p>It drew criticism at the time from Western governments that said Moscow was trying to insulate itself from a wave of popular unrest in eastern Europe and the Middle East.</p>
      <p>Moscow said it was needed to combat Western governments using civil society groups as proxies.</p>
      <p>In October, opposition politician Alexei Navalny’s anti-corruption group was labeled a foreign agent by the Justice Ministry for receiving foreign funding.</p>
