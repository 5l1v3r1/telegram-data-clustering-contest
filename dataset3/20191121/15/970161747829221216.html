      <p>Three men raped an unconscious 17-year-old girl in a hotel room and posted videos of the assault on Snapchat, police said.</p>
      <p>Alexander Wood, Quentin Smith and Domenic Cboins, who are all 18-years-old, were charged Monday with rape and sexual battery after the alleged assault at the Mason Inn in Mason, Ohio in April.</p>
      <p>Wood and Smith face additional charges related to posting videos of the alleged rape online.</p>
      <p>Investigators said the victim and her boyfriend visited the hotel room. The boyfriend later left, but the girl remained in the room.</p>
      <p>Warren County Prosecutor David Forshell said the girl drank an entire bottle of Parrot Bay Rum. She ‘became highly intoxicated and passed out,’ which is when Wood, Smith and Cboins raped her, Fornshell said.</p>

      <p>The victim’s friends called her to ask if she was ok and told her about the Snapchats they say.</p>

      <p>According to Fornshell, the girl was naked and unconscious while she was sexually assaulted on video and in photos.</p>
      <p>‘It’s disgusting that in today’s age anyone still believes that engaging in sexual conduct with a woman who is passed out is anything other than sexual assault,’ Fornshell told <a href="https://local12.com/news/local/3-accused-of-raping-unconscious-teen-at-mason-inn-posting-video-on-snapchat">Local 12.</a></p>
      <p>‘Then, to film the sexual assault and send it to others via Snapchat – it’s sickening….to have these videos of you being sexually assaulted disseminated to a number of individuals without you even knowing until they come and tell you about it after the fact would be horrific,’ Fornshell said.</p>
      <p>Wood, Smith and Cboins are facing more than a decade in prison if convicted and they will likely have to register as sex offenders.</p>
      <p>The are due to appear in court in December.</p>
