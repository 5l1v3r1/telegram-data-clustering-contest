      <p>FIFA 20 will be receiving a free update in March 2020 to add the CONMEBOL Libertadores tournament to the game on PS4, Xbox One and PC, just in time for the group stage of the 2020 edition of the competition.</p>

      <p>Where Europe has the Champions League, South America has CONMEBOL Libertadores. It might not be as illustrious as the Champions League – after all, European football sucks in a huge amount of footballing talent – but the Libertadores tournament features the best clubs from acros Uruguay, Perú, Paraguay, Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina and the rest of the continent.</p>
      <p>You’ll be able to take well known teams like River Plate, Boca Juniors, Corinthians and more, and all of this will feed into FIFA Ultimate Team, Career Mode, Kick-Off and the new CONMEBOL Libertadores Tournament Mode.</p>
      <p>Alongside this, EA will expand its EA Sports FIFA 20 Global Series to include eLibertadores, a route of South Americans into their esports set up. The finals of the eLibertadores will take the top eight competitors from both PS4 and Xbox One, pitting them against each other across 7-8th March 2020 for a chance to win a $100,000 USD prize.</p>
      <p>FIFA 20 launched in September with EA bringing a new Volta game mode, a fresh new spin on street football. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/fifa-20-review/">Catch our review here</a>, where Aran said, “FIFA 20 is pretty much what you’d expect from a new FIFA game. FIFA Ultimate Team continues to march on and grow, card packs and all, while the core gameplay has been tweaked, making attacking play feel great as you rip defences apart. The big new feature is Volta Football, and while it’s a fun distraction, it’s not quite as engaging as its FIFA Street predecessors.”</p>
      <p>By comparison, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/09/fifa-20-switch-review-legacy-edition/">FIFA 20 Legacy Edition for Nintendo Switch</a> didn’t fare quite as well. Notably not included in the list of platforms to receive the new Libertadores content, Reuben summed it up, saying “The Switch’s FIFA legacy is fast becoming outdated gameplay and missing features, and the only way to put a stop to this is to vote with your wallet.”</p>
