      <h1>Transfer Rumour: Jose Mourinho set to offer Tottenham return to Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:03:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/author/varun-madhav/" target="_blank">Keshav Awasty</a></address>
      <h3>Jose Mourinho is reportedly willing to offer an escape route back to Tottenham to beleaguered Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by Spanish publication <a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/20/football/1574267431_072920.html">AS</a>, Jose Mourinho is set to offer Gareth Bale the opportunity to return to Tottenham in next summer’s transfer window. The Welsh forward faces an uncertain future at Real Madrid, who are open to sanctioning a cut-price deal for him.</p>
      <p>Bale has experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows during his five-year stint with Real Madrid. While he has played a pivotal role in the stupendous success that <i>Los Blancos</i> have enjoyed over the last decade and a half, the last couple of years have seen him be riddled with injuries, as a result of which he has endured a stunning fall from grace.</p>
      <p>Ahead of this season, Bale seemed to be at odds with Zinedine Zidane, who even confirmed that Real Madrid were ready to part ways with the player. But, any move failed to materialise, with a <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/07/29/transfer-news-gareth-bale-enraged-as-real-madrid-abort-chinese-super-league-move">high profile Chinese move, in particular, being aborted at the eleventh hour</a>.</p>
      <p>Bale, subsequently, started the season on a strong note, making some noteworthy contributions in a decent advent to the campaign for Real Madrid. But, the Welshman has not featured over the last month due to an injury, although he has now kicked up a storm after representing his country at the UEFA Euro 2020 Qualifiers.</p>

      <p>After Wales beat Hungary to book their place at the competition, the players unfurled a banner that aimed a sly dig at Real Madrid. And, it appears as if the Spanish heavyweights are finally ready to cash in on Bale, piquing the interest of Tottenham.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/20/official-tottenham-hotspur-confirm-jose-mourinho-appointment/">The North London club appointed Jose Mourinho as their new manager on Wednesday</a>, having sacked Mauricio Pochettino a day earlier. And, the former Real Madrid boss is keen on bringing Bale back to Tottenham, handing him an escape route out of the Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s current natural wide options are limited to Son Heung-min, Lucas Moura and Erik Lamela, with Ryan Sessegnon another player who could play on the left flank. And so, it appears as if there could be space to accommodate another wide man in the Tottenham squad, making Bale, who, when fit would be an upgrade over Moura and Lamela, a viable target.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is a long-term admirer of the beleaguered Real Madrid star, with the Portuguese tailing him while in-charge of Manchester United. With Bale ready to move away from the Bernabeu and <i>Los Blancos</i> open to offloading him as well, a future transfer may well see the light of the day,</p>
      <p>But, any move will only be possible next summer and not in the January transfer window and it remains to be seen if Mourinho can finally end up managing Bale after years of pursuing his signature.</p>
