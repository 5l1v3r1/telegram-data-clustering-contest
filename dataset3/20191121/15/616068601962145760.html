      <p>A massive spinning chandelier is being installed under Vancouver's Granville Street Bridge.</p>
      <p>The four-by-six-metre kinetic sculpture is the work of Abbotsford-born artist Rodney Graham and is affiliated with the Vancouver House development.</p>
      <p>Vancouver House was designed by Bjarke Ingels, and the project overall was posited as being “Gesamtkunstwerk” or a “living sculpture.”</p>
      <p>To that end, Graham’s public art piece will slowly rotate and rise over the course of 24 hours, then once a day release and dynamically spin back to its starting point.</p>
      <p>Approved by Vancouver city council in December 2015, installation for the $1.2 million chandelier was expected to happen in 2017 or 2018.</p>
      <p>However, installation finally began this month and is expected to take another couple of weeks.</p>
