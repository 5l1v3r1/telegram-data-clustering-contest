      <p>Being in the limelight is easy but maintaining the shine is the hardest past. The Nigerian entertainment industry has seen the rise and fall of many talented individuals due to quite a number of reasons.</p>
      <p>However, the successful entertainers who have maintained their relevance in the industry sometimes reveal that it has not always been a smooth journey.</p>
      <p>Just recently, top music manager and producer in the country, Donjazzy, took to his Twitter page to speak on how he nearly gave up on his record label, Mavin. According to Jazzy, he made sure to keep pushing as he prayed that fans reap the fruits of their labour.</p>
