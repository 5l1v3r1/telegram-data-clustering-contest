        <b>Tracey Neville and Ama Agbeze will join the Sky Sports team for the Vitality Roses' three-Test series of South Africa at the end of the month with all three matches being streamed on YouTube as well as being shown live on Sky Sports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The tour will mark England's first meetings with the SPAR Proteas since their duel for bronze at the Netball World Cup and is the first televised series for a new-look England under Neville's successor Jess Thirlby.</p>
      <p>With players choosing to take time off, including Jo Harten, Serena Guthrie and Geva Mentor, Thirlby's squad contains some fresher faces as she looks to expose a greater pool of players to the international arena at the start of this new four-year cycle.</p>
      <p>Alongside them, England's most capped international Jade Clarke returns and Stacey Francis will take to the international stage in order to add to their tallies of 169 and 66 caps respectively.</p>
      <p>Natalie Haythornthwaite has been named as captain with Laura Malcolm, who is back in the full-time programme after time away from the international scene, takes on the role of vice-captain.</p>
