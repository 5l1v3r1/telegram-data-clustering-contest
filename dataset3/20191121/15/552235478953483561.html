      <h1>Jose Mourinho makes defiant Tottenham vow as he admits he 'made mistakes' at Manchester United and Chelsea</h1>
      <h2>The new Spurs boss has been speaking to the press in the wake of his ground-shaking appointment this week.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:42:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author">Robbie Copeland</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> has promised he won't be making the same 'mistakes' he made while in charge of Chelsea and Manchester United, as he gears up for a fourth spell in charge in the English Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss is one of the most decorated coaches in history, having won domestic honours in Portugal, Italy, Spain and England as well as two Champions League titles across his 19-year career.</p>
      <p>Regardless of the pedigree he brings to the club, however, his appointment in North London has been met with some scepticism.</p>
      <p>The announcement came on Wednesday less than 24 hours off the back of the controversial sacking of Mauricio Pochettino, who led Spurs to the final of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/champions-league">Champions League</a> last season.</p>
      <p>Also raising concerns is the nature of Mourinho's exit from his last two jobs, as he was sacked from his second spell at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> in 2015, before meeting the same fate three years later at Old Trafford.</p>

      <p>His perceived 'negative' brand of football was touted as one of the reasons behind his departure from each club, as was his apparent penchant for ageing talent - infamously opting to recruit a 29-year-old Alexis Sanchez in what served as one of the nails in his coffin in Manchester.</p>
      <p>But whatever mistakes saw him relieved of his duties in his last two ill-fated spells in England, the former Inter and Real Madrid boss has said he won't be making them again.</p>
      <p>"I realised I made mistakes and I'm not going to make the same mistakes," he said.</p>
      <p>"I'll make new mistakes - but not the same."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Spurs</a> hope Mourinho can be the catalyst to take them to the next level, with the club desperately lacking in major honours despite enjoying a fair amount of domestic success in recent years.</p>
      <p>And winning trophies will be high on his agenda.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"When I don't win I cannot be happy and I cannot change that," he added. "That is my DNA.</p>
      <p>"I hope I can influence my players, because if you are happy losing football matches it is very hard to be a winner."</p>
