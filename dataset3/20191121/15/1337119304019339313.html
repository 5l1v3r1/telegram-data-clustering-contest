      <h1>Google Assistant is getting new calendar and email functions for G Suite accounts</h1>
      <h2>Assistant gets a little more assistive with G Suite</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:13:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/james-vincent" target="_blank">James Vincent</a></address>
      <p>Google Assistant has always been weirdly limited for users who are signed in with G Suite accounts, but Google seems to be slowly fixing this. It added some new functions <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304964/google-assistant-calendar-g-suite-business-users">back in April</a>, and with its <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2019/11/use-google-assistant-with-your-g-suite.html">latest update</a> for Assistant, the company says G Suite users can now use voice commands to perform the following Calendar and Gmail functions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask when your next meeting is</li>
        <li>Create, cancel, and reschedule Calendar events</li>
        <li>Send emails to all attendees of a meeting</li>
        <li>Send emails to specific contacts</li>
        <li>Dial into meetings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A couple of caveats apply, though. First, these features are turned off by default and are currently still in beta. You’ll have to apply to use them. If you’re a domain administrator, that’s no problem; you can sign up <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googleassistantforgsuite-betatestapplication/">here</a>. But if you’re trying to access this for a work account, you might have to convince your admin to apply it for your whole team.</p>
      <p>Secondly, if you’re logged in to both a personal Google account <i>and</i> a work G Suite account, Assistant will only work with one account at a time. “You must switch between those accounts if you’d like to ask a question about your other account,” Google says. Let’s hope Assistant gets more helpful in the future.</p>
