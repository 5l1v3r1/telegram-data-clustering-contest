      <p><b>Kanye West</b> has held his weekly “Sunday Service” religious events in a variety of locations, including <a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/kanye-west-debuted-new-music-at-coachella-sunday-service-watch/">Coachella</a> and, recently, televangelist Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church in Houston, TX. He likely hasn’t hosted the event at a strip club before, but NYC’s Sapphire Gentleman’s Club, located at 39th St in Manhattan, wants to change that. As <i><a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/nyc-strip-club-invites-kanye-west-to-bring-sunday-service-to-venue">Complex</a></i> points out, they’ve written a letter inviting Kanye to “deliver his faith-filled concert in a new venue, to a new audience of Gentlemen’s Club entertainers, service staff &amp; more.” “We’d love to open the doors to our 39th Street location in midtown Manhattan and have you and your choir grace us with your presence,” Vice President Andrew Zarian writes in the letter. Read it in full below:</p>
      <blockquote>Mr. Kanye West,<br/><br/>I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. I am the Vice President at Sapphire Gentleman’s Club in New York City, one of the premier gentleman’s club in the country. I saw you recently brought your Sunday Service inside Harris County Jail and the Baker Street ail in Houston. You followed that up by bringing the Sunday Service to Joel Osteen’s Lakewood Church and delivering a powerful message in your signature stream of consciousness style, making several… interesting… statements throughout.<br/><br/>Given your affinity for adult entertainment, we wanted to extend you an offer to deliver your free faith-filled concert in a new venue and to a new audience of Gentlemen’s Club entertainers, service staff and more. We’d love to open the doors to our 39th Street location in midtown Manhattan and have you and your choir grace us with your presence.<br/><br/>By way of background, Sapphire New York is a premier Gentlemen’s Club in NYC. We deliver top-notch adult entertainment, all with the elegance and class as our sister club in Las Vegas. Sapphire New York, the only New York City gentlemen’s club on the Upper East Side, offers deluxe amenities including designer suites with private butlers, concierge services and varying themes to satisfy every indulgence. With 10,000 square feet of space, 8,000 lovely ladies on staff and all the VIP amenities you could dream of, Sapphire New York is sure to make every man’s fantasies come true.<br/><br/>If you are legitimately interested in our offer, get in touch with us. We are serious about making this happen.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Andrew Zarian<br/>Sapphire Vice President</blockquote>
      <p>You might think someone who <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/kanye-west-pornhub-awards-720366/">teamed with PornHub</a> last year would be down to hold an event in a strip club, but this invitation also comes just days after Kanye equated strip clubs with sex trafficking in a conversation with Joel Osteen saying, “they got posters advertising sex trafficking because if there’s an advertisement for a strip club, that is advertising sex trafficking. At the end of the night, when they close up, the manager says, ‘How much traffic do we have?'”</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Kanye is bringing a new opera, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, to Los Angeles’ <a href="http://ticketmaster.evyy.net/c/259789/264167/4272?u=https://www1.ticketmaster.com/event/0B00576FA16815EA">Hollywood Bowl on November 24</a>. It’s directed by his frequent collaborator Vanessa Beecroft, and features the Sunday Service collective, singer Peter Collins and Infinity’s Song. Here’s the synopsis, according to a press release:</p>
      <blockquote><i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> is an original opera, based on the biblical story of the Babylonian King from the Book of Daniel. Set in the 6th century BC, the Book of Daniel recounts Nebuchadnezzar’s transition from wicked, imperious, self-declared ruler to a true believer who finds salvation in his faith.<br/><br/>West conceived of this opera as an expression of his commitment to both his faith and ever-expanding musical palette. Nebuchadnezzar brings together elements from different worlds, including opera, fine art, modern dance, and gospel music, to create an innovative performance structure. West’s sound is the bridge between these artforms.</blockquote>
      <p>Kanye also says that he has a sequel to his recent album <i><a href="http://www.brooklynvegan.com/kanye-wests-new-album-jesus-is-king-is-finally-actually-here-stream-it/">Jesus is King</a></i> with <b>Dr. Dre</b> on the way:</p>
