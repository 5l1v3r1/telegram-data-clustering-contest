      <p>After Gareth Bale controversially posed with a flag that insulted Real Madrid this week, one of his former teammates has branded the Welshman's actions as "silly".</p>

      <p>The Wales international sparked controversy following his nation's 2-0 win over Hungary, when he was pictured holding a Welsh flag with the words: "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order."</p>
      <p>Bale, who has endured a frosty relationship with Los Blancos in recent times, has since been widely criticised for his actions, and his former colleague Dimitar Berbatov has joined in on the act.</p>
      <p>"Bale was silly to celebrate with that flag," the former Tottenham Hotspur striker told <i>Betfair</i>.</p>
      <p>"There is obviously some tension between Gareth Bale and Madrid. Of course, he is Welsh and he is going to put his country first, but I don't know why he needed to celebrate with that flag, I know it is a bit of banter but it springs unwanted attention.</p>

      <p>"He didn't need that, it's his decision and maybe he felt he wanted to show something like that, but for me it wasn't necessary. Maybe it was an emotional moment or maybe he didn't know what was on the flag, either way it doesn't look great and I think it was a bit silly.</p>
      <p>"He's a quality player, and it's true he isn't treated the right way in Spain, but you have to ask if you aren't treated the right way, why are you still there? If you are good enough, every team will want you and you will play football again."</p>

      <p>Bale joined Real in 2013, and has gone on to score 104 goals in 238 appearances for the club since, including three goals in his side's four most recent UEFA Champions League final triumphs.</p>
