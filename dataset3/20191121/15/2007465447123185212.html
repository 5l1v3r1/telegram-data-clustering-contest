      <h1>PH Gov't to hold massive operation against traffic violations tomorrow</h1>
      <h2>In the wake of numerous traffic fatalities recently</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:37:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/vince-pornelos.html" target="_blank">Vince Pornelos</a></address>
      <p>Enough is enough, or so it seems, for the national government when it comes to these recent fatalities on road accidents.</p>
      <p>We had received a letter that the Philippine government will be conducting a joint operation to apprehend particularly dangerous traffic violations tomorrow, November 22. And by “Philippine government” we mean nationwide, or an operation involving all 17 regions of the country.</p>
      <p>The news comes in the wake of fatal accidents that involved an overloaded truck in Apayao (19 fatalities) as well as an incident that involved a UV Express Van, a truck, and a tricycle without taillights in Camarines Sur (8 fatalities).</p>
      <p>President Duterte has had enough, saying that the situation is not acceptable, and has directed the Land Transportation Office (LTO) and the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG) to strictly enforce the law, especially when it comes to overloaded vehicles.</p>

      <p>The letter from the LTO to the HPG states that tomorrow's joint operation will be a “one-time big-time” event, and will focus apprehending motor vehicle drivers and motorcycle riders, but will focus on dangerous violations such as overloaded vehicles, tricycles on highways, excessive speeds, and other violations.</p>
      <p>The effort will be a coordinated one with the Land Transportation Office's Law Enforcement Service, the Philippine National Police Highway Patrol Group (PNP-HPG), the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA), the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX), the South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), and other agencies.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the letter also states that the LTO's Regional Directors are to conduct similar operations, making this a nationwide “one-time big-time” event.</p>
      <p>Hopefully this won't become a one-time thing, and could become a sustained effort for real road safety.</p>
