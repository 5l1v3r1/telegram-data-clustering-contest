      <p>On Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan coming together in politics, he said, “let them face the elections first and then I will comment on it. Both of them are great actors though.”</p>
      <p>He added that the AIADMK will win in the local body elections with a great margin. “As far as the AIADMK is concerned, there’s no void in the State politics,” he said.</p>
