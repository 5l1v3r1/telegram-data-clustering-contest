      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Xiaomi has launched an affordable new fitness tracker in India, called Mi Band 3i.</li>
        <li>Designed specifically for Indian consumers, the fitness tracker is nearly identical to the Mi Band 3, except for the lack of a heart-rate sensor.</li>
        <li>It has been priced at ₹1,299 ($18) and is now available for purchase from Mi.com.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Xiaomi today launched its first fitness tracker that it says has been designed keeping Indian consumers in mind. The device, named Mi Band 3i, is nearly identical to the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-band-3-review">Mi Band 3</a> in terms of design. It has quite a lot in common with the regular Mi Band 3 in most other areas as well.</p>
      <p>The Mi Band 3i comes with a 0.78-inch monochrome OLED panel with 128 x 80 resolution and a capacitive button below it to help users navigate through the UI. However, unlike the Mi Band 3 and the newer <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-band-4-review">Mi Band 4</a>, it does not come with a heart-rate sensor.</p>
      <p>Apart from the one major omission, the Mi Band 3i has everything that you would expect from an affordable fitness tracker. It has a step and calorie counter with an improved algorithm, sleep quality monitor, and an activity tracker that lets you track activities such as running, walking, cycling, and treadmill.</p>
      <p>The Xiaomi Mi Band 3i has been priced at just ₹1,299 ($18), which makes it significantly cheaper than most of its rivals. Consumers in India can buy now buy the Mi Band 3i from Xiaomi's official website.</p>
