      <p>A knife-wielding husband has been jailed for a savage attack on his wife which forced her to barricade herself and her three children into a bedroom.</p>
      <p>Ryan Fellows carried out a series of attacks on his wife after they argued about his drinking. He throttled her twice, punched her in the face, and stabbed her in the hand, back and thigh.</p>
      <p>She managed to get away from him and fled upstairs where she took refuge in a child's bedroom, where she pushed a desk across the door to stop him getting in.</p>
      <p>A 999 call made from inside the room was recorded and her three daughters could be heard crying in fear in the background. At one point Fellows tried to get in and one of the girls screamed.</p>
      <p>The green handled vegetable knife which he used to stab her was found on the landing outside when police arrived to rescue her from the home in Kingsteignton.</p>
      <p>A body-worn police camera showed her with blood coming from her injured hands and the wound in her back.</p>
      <p>Officers found Fellows sitting at the kitchen table and he refused to respond until they handcuffed him. He claimed he had been the victim of the attack, although he had no injuries.</p>
      <p>Fellows, aged 38, of Kingsteignton, who runs his own building and property maintenance business, admitted wounding and was jailed for a year and eight months by Judge Timothy Rose.</p>
      <p>He was cleared of the more serious charge of intending to cause grievous bodily harm by a jury at Exeter Crown Court after telling them his wife had been the first to pick up the knife.</p>
      <p>The judge told him:"I am quite sure you were the aggressor and the one who obtained and produced the knife and used it to inflict the wounds.</p>
      <p>"This was a sustained assault by you which included throttling and punching her and ultimately the use of the knife. Your decision to use the knife was exceptionally serious."</p>
      <p>The judge made a five year restraining order banning any contact with his wife of children other than for legally authorised family contact. The order also bans him from his former home.</p>
      <p>During a three-day trial, the jury heard how the family had been for a night out at the Sloop in Kingskerswell in August before returning home, where Mrs Fellows went to bed and left her husband drinking downstairs.</p>
      <p>He joined her upstairs shortly before midnight and attacked her after a short argument. He throttled her on two occasions, making her fear she would die.</p>
      <p>She fled to the kitchen but he followed her and punched her in the face, breaking her nose, and then took the knife from a drawer.</p>
      <p>She suffered serious cuts to her hands as she tried to fend him off and stab wounds to her back and thigh before she ran upstairs and barricaded herself, the children and the family dog into a bedroom.</p>
      <p>The couple had been married for 18 years with three children, but the relationship had become turbulent because of concerns about his drinking and mental health.</p>
      <p>Fellows told the jury that his wife started the violence and was the one who picked up the knife, He said he had no intention to stab her and she was injured as they struggled over the knife.</p>
