      <h1>Law enforcement agencies statewide call for rethinking details of bail reform</h1>

      <p>Joining law enforcement groups in simultaneous news conferences across the state, Niagara County Sheriff James Voutour called for a delay in the implementation of laws that would end cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies and speed up the timeline for prosecutors to turn over evidence.</p>
      <p>Voutour, joined by West Seneca Police Chief Dan Denz and Assemblyman Michael Norris R-Lockport, was flanked by about a dozen other representatives from Erie and Niagara county police agencies in Clarence Town Court as they asked for state officials to "reconvene" and "slow things down."</p>
      <p>The new criminal justice reform laws are set to go into effect Jan. 1.</p>

      <p>Police do support some criminal justice reform, including eliminating monetary bail in the cases of nonviolent misdemeanors, such as shoplifting, Voutour said.</p>
      <p>"No one here wants to see people sitting in jail because they're poor," he said.</p>
      <p>But he argued that the new laws go too far, outlining scenarios of people who would be released without bail on an appearance ticket: a person selling heroin to a minor, a drunken driver who hits and kills someone, a burglar. More than 400 criminal charges are on the books for which a judge can impose bail that no longer will qualify, he said.</p>
      <p>"Yes, there's a lot of work that can be done with bail reform," he said. "We just want an opportunity to sit down at the table. We're the one in the streets. We go into dark alleys and catch bad guys. Give us a say in what you're going to do."</p>
      <p>The sweeping changes to the state's criminal justice laws were approved as part of the state budget – often derided as "The Big Ugly," Norris said.</p>
      <p>"The budget was adopted in the middle of the night," he said. "It's dropped on the rank-and-file lawmakers' desk with about an hour to debate. ... These issues should be dealt with on their own by single bills with full openness and transparency."</p>
      <p>Civil rights groups who have been advocating for the reforms blasted Thursday's news conferences, which were planned in Albany, Delhi, New City, Oriskany, Rochester and Syracuse.</p>
      <p>"This is the last cry of the dying law-and-order approach to mass incarceration," said Erin George of Citizen Action of New York, an Albany-based organization with a branch in Buffalo that advocated for the reforms. "The disruption and trauma and fear driven by incarceration is what destabilizes communities."</p>
      <p>Charis Humphrey, a member of the Buffalo group Black Love Resisting in the Rust, was among a small group of criminal justice reform advocates who attended the news conference. She said the majority of people being held in the Erie County Holding Center – about 70 percent – are there because they cannot afford to post bail.</p>
      <p>"We just hope to see what's right," Humphrey said. She pointed out that even the police officers calling for the moratorium agreed that people with nonviolent offenses should be let out.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of public outcry. It is a sign of the times. They know that it's wrong. What we hope to see is that it's truly abolished," Humphrey said.</p>
