      <h1>PSA: You won’t lose your Stadia Pro discounted purchases when you unsubscribe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:51:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/skylled/" target="_blank">Kyle Bradshaw</a></address>
      <p>This morning, a bit of misinformation surrounding Google Stadia was spread — starting from Stadia’s own Twitter account — saying that Stadia Pro members will lose the games they purchased at a discount when they unsubscribe from Stadia Pro. We have confirmed that this is not the case.</p>
      <p>To say that the Google Stadia subreddit has been in a frenzy over the past few days would be an understatement. Everyone is poring over every tweet and statement made by Google and Googlers about Stadia, and one particular tweet <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/dzikys/wtf/">caught their attention</a> this morning.</p>
      <p>In response to an Italian Google Stadia customer’s question about Stadia Pro’s exclusive discounts, <b>the official Stadia account</b> tweeted to the effect that games purchased with the Stadia Pro discount would be lost when unsubscribing.</p>
      <p>We already knew that Stadia Pro’s free games were only yours so long as you’re a member, and would be returned any time you renewed your subscription. To learn that games you’ve <i>purchased</i> would be lost, simply because you got a membership discount, seemed either incredibly inaccurate or incredibly unfair.</p>

      <p>We reached out to Google for a statement to clarify whether the tweet was accurate, and a spokesperson had this to share.</p>
      <blockquote>If your Stadia Pro subscription ends, you will keep access to any purchases made while you were a subscriber. You will only lose access to the games you <u>claimed for free</u> during your subscription period.</blockquote>
      <p>Very clearly, the only things you lose when unsubscribing from Stadia Pro are access to 4K streaming and the free games you’ve claimed. On Twitter, Google Stadia also issued a <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia/status/1197531167962083331">correction to their original answer</a>, clarifying, in the same way, that all purchases made as a Pro member are kept.</p>
      <p>So, if you were hoping, down the line, to purchase a one month subscription to Stadia Pro for $10 to rack up on discounted games, that is completely allowed, if not expected.</p>
