      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 ― The Agriculture and Agro-based Industry (MOA) Minister and his deputy do not interfere in the awarding of contracts to any party, Parliament heard today.</p>
      <p>Deputy minister Sim Tze Tzin stressed this point today when rejecting the allegation of Datuk Seri Dr Wee Ka Siong (BN-Ayer Hitam) made during the debate on the Supply Bill 2020, that three contracts connected to a paddy project exceeding a total value of RM1 billion had been cancelled because the ministry allegedly wanted to award the project to the National Farmers Organization (Nafas).</p>
      <p>Sim said the tenders in connection with the project were being validated by the Finance Ministry.</p>
      <p>He explained that in accordance with procedure, after a tender was approved at MOA level, it needed to be validated by the Finance Ministry, after which the MOA would issue a letter of acceptance to the successful tenderer. </p>
      <p>According to a Finance Ministry circular dated June 29, 2018, any tender exceeding RM50 million in value, requires the ministry's validation, Sim added. ― Bernama</p>
