      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) is accelerating efforts to strengthen its business footprint in India as it sees higher demand for energy, power and consumer goods driven by its rapid urbanisation and rising middle-class.</p>
      <p>“Petronas is on-track to build an effective business ecosystem in India to better serve our customers and stakeholders in this important market,” said chairman of Petronas Energy (India) Private Limited, Rizan Ismail in a statement today.</p>
      <p>He made the remark during Petronas’ annual official visit to meet customers and partners in Mumbai recently.</p>
      <p>He said Petronas is actively tapping into India’s innovation ecosystem by forging strategic collaborations with major India-based companies. These include working with TATA Consultancy Services to optimise the downstream integrated supply chain, as well as Accenture Ventures in Bengaluru and GEP in Mumbai to develop a centralised system for Petronas digital procurement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, through Universiti Teknologi Petronas (UTP), the group signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with local institutions such as Amity University; BMS College of Engineering; Central Institute of Technology (CIT) Kokrajhar, and Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) to collaborate in academic expertise exchange, research projects, and students exchange. This marks the company’s commitment to expand collaboration with its Indian counterparts in the energy space and beyond.</p>
      <p>“Moving forward, we will ramp up efforts to innovate and customise our product offerings by leveraging on the business synergy shared with our partners in India as well as our integrated experience and expertise in providing innovative solutions,” Rizan added.</p>
