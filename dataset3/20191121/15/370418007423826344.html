      <p>While the world is still awaiting confirmation of a potential <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/hole/">Hole</a> reunion, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/courtney-love/">Courtney Love</a> has just released a new song, Mother, as part of the soundtrack to upcoming movie The Turning.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the release of the Floria Sigismondi-directed film on January 24, Courtney has unveiled the opening song from its soundtrack – and revealed that it was a “genuine privilege” to work with Floria, as well as Mother co-writer Lawrence Rothman, on the project.</p>
      <p>“I’ve long admired her work, particularly The Runaways and the Marilyn Manson videos,” Courtney says. “Floria and Lawrence had a clear vision on what they wanted to achieve and it was an honour to be invited into their studio and to become a part of it.”</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/courtney-love-teases-a-hole-reunion-with-now-deleted-instagram-post/">Last month</a> Courtney teased a Hole reunion in an Instagram post that was swiftly deleted. It followed her comments in May to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/25/courtney-love-a-hole-reunion-we-are-definitely-talking-about-it">The Guardian</a> that the band are “definitely talking about it”.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing wrong with honouring your past; I’ve just kind of discovered that,” she said. “If you don’t, people will rewrite history and you will become an inconvenient woman.”</p>
