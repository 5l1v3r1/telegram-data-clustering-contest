      <p>Similar to the Huawei version, the Sport Pro boasts up to 18 hours of music playback on a single charge. If you need to charge the earphones, you can detach the three-button control panel to reveal a rather convenient USB-C head. A quick 5-minute charge is rated to provide up to 4 hours of music playback. If you’re using an Honor smartphone, it can support quick pairing by simply plugging it into your phone.</p>

      <p>During the presentation, Honor claims that the Sport Pro is great for gaming with its ultra-low latency of 86ms. It’s not as low as Razer’s <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/31/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-gamers-earphones-android-ios/">Hammerhead</a> but it is significantly lower than Apple’s AirPods and BeatsX. Since it has “Sport” in the name, the earphones are also splashproof with a rating of IPX5.</p>
