      <h1>Hamilton pupils chant "Oh Jeremy Corbyn" as the Labour Leader arrives in town</h1>
      <h2>As part of a whistle-stop tour of Scotland, Mr Corbyn spoke to the crowds in Hamilton last week.</h2>

      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was on the campaign trail in Hamilton on Wednesday, November 13, backing his party’s candidates Ged Killen and Andrew Hilland.</p>
      <p>As part of a whistle-stop tour of Scotland, Mr Corbyn and Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard spoke to crowds at Hamilton Retail Park ahead of the general election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Cries of ‘Oh Jeremy Corbyn’ greeted the Labour leader as pupils from Holy Cross High School joined Labour party members from across South Lanarkshire to hear their policies for the election.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn said: “We face a very clear choice. Do you want to continue in the UK with a Tory government, with austerity, with poverty, with foodbanks, with Universal Credit, with the sense of despair and hopelessness that so many young people face at the present time?</p>
      <p>“Or do you want a Labour government that will invest for our future, invest to care for those who need it, invest in a future for young people with their jobs and their hopes fully intact?</p>
      <p>“Here, in this constituency, our policies will make a massive difference.</p>
      <p>“There are 10,000 people in this constituency earning less than the living wage. There are 10,000 people also on Universal Credit, some of whom are the same people.</p>
      <p>“There are nearly 5000 people in receipt of personal independence payments and one third of them receive them for what is euphemistically called for psychiatric disorders by the DWP.</p>
      <p>“The reality is they are going through mental health stress within our society.</p>
      <p>“Things can be and must be done differently and better.”</p>
      <p>Mr Leonard added: “This is an election which we can win and when I say we can win it I mean we can win a majority Labour government. This is a general election.</p>
      <p>This is not a referendum on a referendum. To reduce it to that would be to turn our backs on all those people up and down this country who a reliant on foodbanks.</p>
      <p>“The job of the Labour party is to form a new alliance with the people so that we get rid of poverty and the growth of inequality.</p>
      <p>“We say no to Trump. We say no to Johnson and we say yes to a Jeremy Corbyn-lead government in Downing Street.” They also called for a new £10/hr minimum wage for everyone over 16 and tougher action on climate change, while ruling out any “deals, pacts or coalitions” and protecting the NHS from post-Brexit a trade deal with the USA.</p>
      <p>A small group of Union Jack-waving, anti-independence Orange Order members had gathered, claiming “Corbyn can’t be trusted”.</p>
      <p>However, they failed to make themselves heard during Mr Corbyn’s speech. Labour’s policy is for Scotland to remain part of the UK.</p>
      <p>After Mr Corbyn’s visit to Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the Labour leader shouldn’t ask for the support of the SNP unless he accepted the principle of a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>She felt it was a “basic issue of democracy” and added that it was “highly unlikely” Labour would reject a referendum if it prevented them getting into government. She said: “I won’t help him [JC] in power, to get into power, to stay in power if he doesn’t accept the principle that whether there is <br/>a referendum in Scotland and what <br/>the timescale of that referendum should be is determined by the people of Scotland.</p>
      <p>“The reason I think Jeremy Corbyn keeps getting into a mess on this question is that he knows it is not democratically acceptable or democratically sustainable to block the right of the Scottish people to choose their future.”</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson redoubled his party’s stance against a second independence referendum.</p>
      <p>He said: “We can honour the wishes of the people or else we can waste more time, at the cost of a billion pounds per month, and have two more referendums, one on Scotland and one on the EU – an expense of spirit and a waste of shame, more political self-obsession.”</p>
      <p>Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie spoke more about policy than referenda.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s really important we move on, we learn the lessons from Brexit rather than trying to repeat them with independence.</p>
      <p>“Let’s try to tackle things like childcare expansion, let’s tackle the climate emergency, deal with mental health service problems that we’ve got in this country.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had enough of the division and damage over the constitution.”</p>
