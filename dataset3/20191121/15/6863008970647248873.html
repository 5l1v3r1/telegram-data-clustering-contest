      <p>Head of the EU Delegation to Ukraine, Ambassador Matti Maasikas says the European Union has mobilized an unprecedented package of financial support for Ukraine, worth EUR 15 billion, and it intends to continue providing aid as reforms progress.</p>
      <p>"Since 2014, the European Union has mobilized an unprecedented aid package of EUR 15 billion in grants and loans to support the reform process in almost all sectors," he said at a public meeting of Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers on November 20.</p>
      <p>The financial aid was allocated for such areas as transport, energy, food safety, agriculture, antitrust agencies, financial services, customs, and environmental protection.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the more reforms will be implemented in Ukraine, the more financial support will be provided to the country, he added.</p>
      <p>According to Maasikas, the share of the European Union in Ukraine's trade continues to grow as well.</p>
      <p>"Today, the share of the European Union in Ukraine's total trade is 42% and it continues to grow," he said.</p>
      <p><b>UNIAN memo</b>. In 2014, the European Union and Ukraine signed the Association Agreement, which marked the beginning of a new period in relations between the EU and Ukraine.</p>
      <p>The Agreement is the main instrument for ensuring Ukraine's rapprochement with the EU: it contributes to the deepening of political relations, stronger economic ties, and mutual respect for common values. The economic part of the agreement, on a deep and comprehensive free trade area (<a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10481367-ebrd-eu4business-launch-sme-credit-line-in-ukraine.html">DCFTA</a>), provides Ukraine with an opportunity to expand trade relations and economic development since it opens up new markets, contributes to harmonizing legislation, standards, and regulations in various sectors. The latter will help Ukraine integrate EU standards into key sectors of the economy.</p>
