      <h1>'There's stuff people don't see' - Neal Ardley on a 'crazy' year in charge of Notts County</h1>
      <h2>Magpies boss also reveals his highlight of a dramatic year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:49:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:49</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Neal Ardley has reflected on a dramatic year in charge of Notts County and admitted the arrival of the new owners Christoffer and Alexander Reedtz has been the highlight of a “crazy” 12 months.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> boss will lead his side to Aldershot on Saturday in the hope of keeping the pressure on their promotion rivals, but it happens to be on the same date he was confirmed as Harry Kewell's successor last year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> was unable to prevent Notts' relegation from the Football League in May which was then followed by significant financial uncertainty in the summer which left some fans fearing they were heading for extinction.</p>
      <p>As staff went unpaid, and the club went to the High Court over an unpaid tax bill, Notts’ future was finally secured when the Reedtz brothers completed a takeover from previous owner Alan Hardy</p>
      <p>Looking back at what has tantamount to a a soap opera at times, Ardley says he has no regrets about taking charge of Notts and   is hopeful of a bright future at Meadow Lane.</p>
      <p>“This time last year I might have been in Dubai having a few days in the sun,” he joked.</p>
      <p>“But it’s been crazy. I came here under one stewardship in one league, but here I am a year later with new owners, a new team and in a different division.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think you can have regrets and there’s no future in looking backwards.</p>
      <p>“I am proud to be the manager of Notts County. I want to turnaround what happened and try my best to make sure the fans talk about something I achieved rather than what happened last season.</p>
      <p>“There’s not been many ups over the last year, although there has been more of them this season than last.</p>
      <p>“And I would say the high point was the day the owners got the club because there were weeks and weeks of not knowing what was going to happen.</p>
      <p>“That was finally a day when you thought there was a chance of making forward steps.</p>

      <p>“I met them properly a few days after they took over and straight away I had a really good feeling.</p>
      <p>“They were keen to get on with things and bring players in. Those few days were the highest point.”</p>
      <p>The Reedtz brothers have significantly backed Ardley in the transfer market and funded the arrival of 13 new players in the space of a fortnight after a transfer embargo was lifted just before the start of the season.</p>
      <p>But despite a turbulent summer, Notts have exceeded expectation which has left them just six points adrift of leaders Barrow.</p>
      <p>They are also in the second round of the FA Cup and are set to begin their FA Trophy quest next month.</p>
      <p>With Notts fans eager to return to the Football League at the first attempt, Ardley says he will be frustrated if his side are not involved in the top-seven running at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>“You could probably write a book on what’s happened here in the last year,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But we have to look forward. We have an aim of being in the top seven come the end of the season and have a chance of some success.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t get that then I will be disappointed.”</p>
      <p>Ardley said that sacrificing time away from his family was tough as he tries to deliver glory at Meadow Lane, but hopes it will be worth it in the long run.</p>
      <p>“Personally, there’s been stuff people don’t see like living away from my family,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I probably see my wife and children twice a week at best which is Saturday night and Sunday.</p>
      <p>“A three-hour drive is made a little bit easier if the team is doing well but that hasn’t always been the case.</p>
      <p>“There’s been lots of tough parts to it, but hopefully one day everybody will be singing, happy, and all of it was worth it.”</p>
