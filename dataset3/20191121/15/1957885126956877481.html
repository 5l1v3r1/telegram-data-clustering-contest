      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:35:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Imogen Beckhelling</a></address>
      <p>Autonauts, the game about colony management and robot automation, released a big old roadmap today, laying out all the free DLC on its way over the next six months.</p>
      <p>The simulation game from Denki and Curve Digital is all about colonising procedurally-generated planets with the help of some programmable robots. Players need to collect resources, craft useful items and build their AI helpers in order to make their colonies thrive.</p>
      <p>Today, the game received the very first of its free updates, introducing new bot variants, new cooking options and brand new apparel to decorate yourself, your bots and your colonists.</p>
