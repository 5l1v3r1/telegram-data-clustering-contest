      <h1>Lippo Cikarang former director detained for Meikarta bribery case investigation</h1>

      <p>The Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) has detained former president director of PT Lippo Cikarang Bartholomeus Toto in relation to an investigation into alleged corruption pertaining to the Meikarta development project in Bekasi regency, West Java.</p>
      <p>Bartholomeus, who has been named a suspect in the case, was sent to detention following a 10-hour questioning ─ which was also his third one ─ with the KPK on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“The suspect BTO [Bartholomeus Toto] will be detained initially for 20 days at the KPK’s detention center located behind the Merah Putih building,” KPK spokesman Febri Diansyah said, referring to the KPK headquarters in Jakarta.</p>
      <p>Bartholomeus was seen exiting the Merah Putih building on Wednesday evening, handcuffed and wearing an orange KPK detention vest.</p>
      <p>In front of journalists, Bartholomeus claimed he was a victim of defamation and denied allegations that he had allowed Lippo Cikarang to wire a bribe of around Rp 10.5 billion (US$744,248) to former Bekasi regent Neneng Hasanah Yasin in exchange for expediting licensing for the Meikarta Project.</p>
      <p>The KPK has accused him of approving at least five transfers of the illicit funds, which allegedly were to secure the land allotment license (IPPT) for the $21 billion flagship project of the Lippo business group.</p>
      <p>Yasin herself has been found guilty of involvement in the case and was sentenced to six years in prison by the Bandung Corruption Court in May.</p>
      <p>Bartholomeus and former West Java Administration secretary Iwa Karniwa were named suspects by the KPK in the Meikarta case on July 29.</p>
      <p>Iwa allegedly accepted a bribe of Rp 900 million for the West Java administration’s approval of the regency’s detailed spatial planning (RDTR) bylaw for the Meikarta project. Iwa has also been detained by the KPK. (ami)</p>
