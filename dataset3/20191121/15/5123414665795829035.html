      <p>It's pretty amazing how far technology has come in the past 20 years, especially when it comes to electronic music production and social media. The knowledge that was once reserved for a select few can now be instantly searched for using YouTube, and as a result, common people can and are becoming globally recognized public figures. One such individual is a YouTuber by the name of Cuckoo, who's quirkiness and simplistic approach to making music and tutorials on hardware have created a cult following. I can attest to this, as I personally am a big fan of his work, and have, on several occasions, used his videos to learn how to use my hardware. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year at Moogfest, I had a chance to sit with him for an in-depth discussion on everything from how he became such a beloved YouTuber, the moment he discovered he could make a real living off of it, and why giving back to the community is the way to succeed. </p>
