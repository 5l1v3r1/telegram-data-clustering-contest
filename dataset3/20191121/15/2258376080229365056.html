      <p>SASKATOON -- Saskatoon police have recovered over $5,000 dollars in medical supplies taken from a porch of a home in the city's Riversdale neighbourhood on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The boxes contained medical bandages for nearly two-year-old Leo Leptich, a toddler living with epidermolysis bullosa, according to the boy's family.</p>
      <p>Tuesday evening, Leo's family shared a video captured by a doorbell camera that appeared to show two women taking the boxes from the porch.</p>
      <p>The toddler relies on the bandages to prevent painful cuts or blistering associated with his rare and painful skin condition, often referred to as "butterfly skin."</p>
      <p>A video posted by Leo's father Adam Leptich on Facebook Thursday morning shows the boy sitting on the recovered boxes.</p>
      <p>"Thank you everybody," Leo says.</p>
