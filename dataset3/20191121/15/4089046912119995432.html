      <p><b>MORRISTOWN, Tenn. (WVLT) â€”</b> The Morristown Police Department is warning motorists about a rash of car part thefts.</p>
      <p>According to investigators, catalytic converters are being stolen from vehicles, especially larger vehicles like trucks and work vans due to easier access underneath the vehicles.</p>
      <p>Police said to protect your property always park your vehicle in a well-lit, highly visible area.</p>
      <p>Devices can also be used to protect the converter from being cut off your vehicle.</p>
      <p>Catalytic converters attach to the exhaust pipe of vehicles to help filter out harmful chemicals. Without one, a vehicle can continue to operate but the "check engine" light could be triggered.</p>
      <p>Police say anyone who falls victim to this crime should call the Morristown Police Department at (423) 585-2701.</p>
