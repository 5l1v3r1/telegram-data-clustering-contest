      <p>Lebanese eatery <a href="https://www.comptoirlibanais.com/restaurants">Comptoir Libanais</a> has launched its Christmas feasting menu – and it had us at the word feasting!</p>
      <p>Diners can add a Middle Eastern flavour to their festive celebrations with three courses designed to reflect the "hospitality and warmth shown in homes across the Middle East".</p>
      <p>For £24.95, you can expect to enjoy four mezze-style starters.</p>

      <p>Opt for roasted sea bass, honey and harissa grilled chicken, lamb kofta or a veggie feta and aubergine shakshuka – a spicy slow-cooked concoction with tomatoes, peppers, onion and garlic.</p>
