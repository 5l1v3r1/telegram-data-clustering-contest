      <h1>St Mirren boss Jim Goodwin keen to put Hearts defeat behind him</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/st-mirren/"><b>St Mirren</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jim-goodwin/"><b>Jim Goodwin</b></a> has consigned a "freak" result at Hearts to history as he prepares for the resumption of the Ladbrokes Premiership on Saturday.</h2>

      <p>The Irishman described the 5-2 defeat at Tynecastle before the international break as one of his worst days in the dugout.</p>
      <p>The Paisley side remain bottom of the table, two points behind St Johnstone as they await the visit of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/ross-county/"><b>Ross County</b></a>, which is where Goodwin's focus has turned.</p>
      <p>The former Alloa manager said: "I've been quite fortunate in my three years of management that I haven't had any kind of defeats like that.</p>
      <p>"It took a couple of days to get over it.</p>
      <p>"It's an old cliche where people say you can't get too high and you can't get too low, but I certainly can't remember feeling as low after the game for a long, long time.</p>
      <p>"I'm not a doom and gloom type person, I'm quite a realist and sometimes in this industry, you've just got to accept that a freak result like that that can happen.</p>
      <p>"If you watch the goals back, Hearts had six attempts on target and scored five and we had five on targets and only scored two.</p>
      <p>"There was nothing too glaringly obvious in terms of time to hit the panic button or anything like that.</p>
      <p>"It was just one of those days when nothing went our way.</p>
      <p>"Our home form has been excellent. We have conceded one goal against Rangers, which was a free-kick.</p>
      <p>"So we're looking forward to playing there again Saturday.</p>
      <p>"I think it is almost a month I think since our last home game so, a helluva long time that we've had to wait to go back there.</p>
      <p>"But we're looking forward to it. We've got two games back-to-back, Ross County on Saturday, Hibs on the Tuesday and hopefully we can carry on that good home form."</p>
