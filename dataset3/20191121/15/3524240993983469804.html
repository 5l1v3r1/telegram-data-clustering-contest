      <h1>Court sentences three over US embassy shooting</h1>

      <p>A Turkish court sentenced three men to prison on Thursday for shooting at the US embassy in Ankara last year.</p>
      <p>They got sentences ranging from just over three years to more than 10 years for “membership in a terrorist organisation” and “actions aimed at sabotaging relations with a foreign country”, according to state news agency Anadolu.</p>
      <p>The US embassy was fired upon from a car on August 20, 2018, without any casualties.</p>
      <p>One of the men told the court he carried out “this stupid action” due to “patriotism” and alcohol.</p>
      <p>“Whatever decision you take, long live the state,” he said, according to Anadolu.</p>
      <p>At the time, the government described the shooting as an attempt to “sow chaos” at a moment when relations between Turkey and the United States were deeply strained.</p>
      <p>Washington had recently imposed sanctions against Turkey in response to its detention of an American pastor, who was later freed.</p>
      <p>The anti-American sentiment was already widespread in Turkish media and influential political circles over a number of issues, particularly its refusal to extradite religious leader Fetullah Gulen, whom it accuses of orchestrating a failed coup in 2016.</p>
