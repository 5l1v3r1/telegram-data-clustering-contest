      <h1>Antonio Brown Shares New Workout Video, Hints At Return</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:57:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>With only a month remaining in the regular season, it appears Antonio Brown isn’t ready to give up on a potential return.</p>
      <p>This year has been quite a spectacle for Brown. He basically forced his way out of Pittsburgh, and then after things didn’t go well in Oakland he demanded the team to release him. Brown then signed a one-year deal with the New England Patriots. Many people thought he’d find a solid role with the defending champions, but he didn’t even last two weeks.</p>
      <p>New England released Brown after <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-east/new-england-patriots/antonio-brown-accuser-text-messages-painter">he appeared to threaten a sexual assault accuser</a>. The All-Pro wide receiver recently met with the NFL to discuss these claims.</p>
      <p>Although there’s no update on Brown’s future in the NFL just yet, the outspoken wideout shared a workout video for his followers on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Brown posted a video of him running routes with the following caption: “Staying ready excited to get back to the field and inspire others!”</p>
      <p>Check it out:</p>

      <p>Judging off his tweet, it sounds as if Brown will try to return to the NFL at some point in the future.</p>
      <p>It’d be a surprise if he is cleared to play before the end of this season, but there’s definitely a legitimate chance he’ll be back in the league by next year.</p>
      <p>Do you think we’ll see Brown on the field in the coming weeks?</p>
