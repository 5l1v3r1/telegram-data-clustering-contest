      <h1>Luka Doncic is taking over the NBA one triple-double at a time</h1>

      <p>There’s no stopping Luka Doncic right now.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Slovenian sensation has been running roughshod over the NBA so far this season, and the guard dominated once again Wednesday night for the Mavericks, recording his seventh triple-double in 14 games as Dallas destroyed what’s left of the Golden State Warriors, 142-94.</p>
      <p>Doncic had 35 points, 11 assists and 10 rebounds in just 25:30 Wednesday and shot 11-for-18, including 6-for-10 from 3-point range. It was his second consecutive triple-double, having put up 42 points, 12 assists and 11 rebounds Monday against the Spurs.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1197345856137113600?s=20">Elias Sports Bureau</a>, Doncic is the youngest player — at 20-years, 265-days old — to record consecutive 35-point triple-doubles; Oscar Robertson was previously the youngest to accomplish that feat at 22-years, 34-days old.</p>
      <p>“Look, he’s a very special player on a special roll,” Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28126914/mavericks-luka-doncic-posts-35-point-triple-double-25-minutes">told reporters</a> after the game. “There’s not much else to say. This isn’t a big news flash now. This is getting to be pretty normal.”</p>
      <p>Doncic eclipsed 300 points, 100 assists and 100 rebounds over his last 10 games. He became the fifth player in NBA history to average a triple-double with at least 30 points per game over a 10-game span, joining Robertson, Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook, <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1197340506277191682?s=20">per Elias</a>.</p>

      <p>As if he hasn’t amazed enough, Doncic also outscored, out-assisted and out-rebounded the injury-riddled Warriors during Wednesday’s first quarter, becoming the first player to do that against a team in one quarter since Allen Iverson did so against the Bulls on Feb. 19, 2003, <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1197334498226114565?s=20">according to Elias</a>.</p>
      <p>Doncic figures to be a favorite for NBA MVP if he keeps this up. In the most recent Westgate odds, Doncic has the fourth-best odds to win MVP at 10/1 behind Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden and LeBron James, in that order. William Hill has Doncic with the fifth-best odds at 8/1 behind Antetokounmpo, Harden, James and Anthony Davis.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks improved to 9-5 and it seems like no matter how well Kristaps Porzingis works back into form after returning from ACL surgery, he will continue to play Robin to Doncic’s Batman.</p>
