      <h1>New public safety minister says Huawei 5G decision timeline is undecided but a priority</h1>
      <h2>The new public safety minister was sworn in on November 20th</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:18:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Newly sworn-in Public Safety Minister Bill Blair has said that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5g-huawei-china-bill-blair-1.5367002">there is no timeline</a> regarding when Canada will make a decision on its Huawei 5G review.</p>
      <p>He says that it is a priority to decide whether the Chinese tech giant will be allowed to participate in the deployment of Canada’s next-generation 5G network, but is unsure when this will happen.</p>
      <p>“I think there are some complex economic and security issues that need to be addressed,” Blair <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5g-huawei-china-bill-blair-1.5367002">said to reporters</a> on November 20th, according to the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/5g-huawei-china-bill-blair-1.5367002"><i>CBC</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“And it will be a priority when we come back to government and when cabinet meets to examine those issues and make that decision. I don’t have a specific timetable at this time.”</p>
      <p>The former Public Safety Minister, Ralph Goodale <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/05/01/huawei-ban-decision-before-election/">previously said that the decision</a> on Huawei would come after the election campaign. He also stated that the government needed more information from the U.S. regarding the possibility of a security threat.</p>
      <p>Huawei’s relationship with Canada became hostile when Vancouver authorities arrested its chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in December 2018. She currently awaits extradition to the U.S. to face a trial.</p>
      <p>China has also <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/07/22/huawei-canada-detained-canadians-china/">detained two Canadians</a> in a move that is believed to be retaliation for arresting Meng. The country alleges they were part of a national security threat.</p>
      <p>Huawei Canada’s president says that t<a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/huawei-smartphones-canada-future-5g-ban/">he company will incur a significant loss</a> if it is banned from participating in 5G infrastructure development across the country, but stated that it will continue its investment in Canada regardless.</p>
      <p>Huawei executives recently have <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/huawei-canada-diplomatically-forceful-lobbying-trudeau-government/">also insisted the company’s lobbying</a> and Canadian strategy moving forward will be “diplomatically forceful.”</p>
