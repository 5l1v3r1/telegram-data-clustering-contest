      <h1>Average Bugatti Buyer Spends Over $300,000 On Options</h1>
      <h2>And this is on top of the base car. Taxes not included.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:25:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Whether it's a new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bugatti/chiron">Chiron</a> or <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bugatti/divo">Divo</a>, nearly every Bugatti is built to order as these exotic hypercars can be customized in a seemingly endless number of ways. One buyer, for example, even requested their family crest inside, as Bugatti President Stephan Winkelmann revealed to us earlier this week. We caught up with the globe-trotting dapper Bugatti chief at a private Bugatti event held during this month's 2019 LA Auto Show and, among other things, asked how much buyers spend on extras.</p>
      <p>"It's limitless in terms of materials," Winkelmann said. "It's not limitless in terms of options or individualization programs, which is half a million [euros] on top of what you get [over the base car]. But then it's limitless if you have other desires which are not foreseen."</p>

      <p>According to Winkelmann, the average amount Bugatti customers spend on options is "300,000 euros. This does not include the base car or taxes." Now that Winkelmann has taken over as President from Wolfgang Durheimer, there are now two Bugatti models on sale, instead of just one, as was the case of the Veyron. Both the Chiron and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bugatti/chiron-super-sport-300">Chiron Super Sport 300+</a> (the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/features/cars-that-sold-out-before-they-went-on-sale">Divo</a> is sold out) are limited in production. We asked Winkelmann what he thinks an ideal yearly production figure is.</p>
      <p>"Everything below 1,000 cars produced a year for me is not influencing," he said. "Let's say the visibility of 80 million cars produced each and every year, which is what the industry is doing, just means that if you split the work into three main regions like North America, 300 cars, Europe 300, and another 300 in the rest of the world, then you really don't get visibility. Today we produce below 100 cars."</p>

      <p>Does this mean Bugatti wants to increase production to 1,000 a year? It sure sounds that way, but building that many Chirons would not only devalue the car and anger buyers, it's also bad business. Though the Chiron may be profitable, it's not that profitable. One solution would be the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bugattis-next-model-could-be-less-pricey">planned electric grand tourer</a> with seating for up to four passengers and a price tag ranging from $550,000 to $1 million. The Chiron's starting price, to compare, is nearly $3 million.</p>
      <p>This unnamed model alone could add around 600 units annually â€“ far closer to Winkelmann's desired 1,000-unit mark. Any new Bugatti means high levels of customization so that 300,000 euros option average could go even higher.</p>
