      <p>Katie Price's financial woes rumble on as her pink Range Rover appears to have been repossessed.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old mum of five, who due back in court later this month to face a fresh bankruptcy petition, a year after she promised to pay off her debts through the use of an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA), is reportedly is no longer in possession of the car.</p>
      <p>The bubblegum pink vehicle, which is worth around £75,000, arrived on the forecourt of the Saxton 4X4 Chelmsford in Essex, after being purchased at a car auction, the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7710421/Katie-Prices-iconic-pink-Range-Rover-repossessed-sale-Essex-used-car-garage.html">MailOnline</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The publication also told that ‘repo’, short for repossession, was penned on the vehicle's windscreen.</p>
      <p>An onlooker at the car dealership said: "It’s a very striking car but we didn’t know straight away that it belonged to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> . But then one of the buyers told us that it was hers. We couldn't believe how filthy it was...</p>

      <p>"We’re all very surprised that it’s been repossessed. Saxton buyers visit car auctions regularly and that’s where they picked it up...</p>
      <p>"Once it’s all been checked out, it’ll go on sale and will probably fetch a decent price. I’m sure some people will even pay more for it if they know it once belonged to Katie Price."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online have contacted Katie's rep for comment.</p>
      <p>The repossession of her Barbie-themed car comes ahead of Katie's court appearance later this month, where she's facing a fresh bankruptcy claim.</p>

      <p>In October a pal of the glamour model revealed to Mirror Online that Katie was determined not to let her beloved bright pink £75,000 Range Rover be seized as an asset.</p>
      <p>The distinctive Barbie pink 4x4 - which has been left untaxed since August 1, 2019 - was parked away from her home to avoid detection by eagle-eyed bailiffs, said the insider.</p>
      <p>"She's told a few of her close friends that her car was going to be repossessed a few weeks ago so she hid it from the creditors to ensure it would go back to the garage that loaned it to her," our source told Mirror Online.</p>
      <p>"She's worried bailiffs will come to the house and take it, so she's moved it in a garage a few miles away.</p>
      <p>"At the time she took out the car, she was told that if she doesn't return it then the dealer would have to report it to the police as stolen, which is why she is hiding it to ensure it gets back to the dealer."</p>

      <p>The insider went on: "She says she's not bothered about not driving it because it brought her too much attention - but that's the reason she loved it so much, everyone knew her car.</p>
      <p>"It became iconic to her and fans would wait near it when it was parked so they could meet her when she came back."</p>
      <p>The Range Rover was part of the her IVA, but the pal claims Katie never saw its repayments as a priority and hadn't paid the dealer in months.</p>
      <p>"Katie had a fleet of cars at one point on her drive but over the past few months they have gradually been disappearing," they went on.</p>
      <p>"She doesn't seem bothered, she has asked her friend to arrange another Range Rover for her through one of her contacts.</p>
      <p>"She's also convinced the babysitter, Lauryn Cook, to drive her up and down the country as a paid chauffeur.</p>
      <p>"She won't hand it back to the dealer herself because she's embarrassed by the situation."</p>

      <p>The old Range Rover suffered extensive damage when it crashed into a hedge last October, following a boozy night out to celebrate Katie's boyfriend Kris Boyson's 30th birthday.</p>
      <p>Katie had tried to argue in court that she was not in control of the 4x4 in the early hours of October, insisting a mystery man had driven, but the judge ruled Katie was not a 'credible' witness.</p>
      <p>He found her guilty of being in charge of the vehicle while over the legal limit.</p>
      <p>The three-month driving ban was added to another from earlier in the year when Katie was summoned to court for getting behind the wheel while disqualified and uninsured.</p>
