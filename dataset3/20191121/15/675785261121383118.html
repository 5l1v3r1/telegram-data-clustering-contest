      <h2>Kate Middleton was scheduled to join Prince William at two events this evening - one at the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square and another in the National Portrait Gallery</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:23:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:23</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>The Duchess of Cambridge has pulled out of an event she was due to attend this evening due to an undisclosed matter relating to Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.</p>
      <p>Kate was due to join Prince William at the Tusk Conservation Awards at the Empire Cinema in Leicester Square this evening, before heading to a reception at the National Portrait Gallery.</p>
      <p>However the couple met finalists of the Tusk Conservation awards instead, which suggests the children's health was not the reason behind the cancellation.</p>
      <p>A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said: "The duchess is no longer able to attend the Tusk awards due to the children.</p>
      <p>"She will still however meet finalists at a tea at Kensington Palace this afternoon. The duke as patron will attend both."</p>

      <p>William, who has been Royal Patron of Tusk since December 2005, will attend both events on his own.</p>
      <p>The Duke has actively supported the charity’s work both privately and publicly on many occasions and last visited Tusk projects in Namibia and Tanzania in 2018.</p>
      <p>The organisation pioneers successful conservation action in Africa by protecting wildlife, empowering communities and advancing the frontline in the fight against the illegal wildlife.</p>
      <p>The annual awards celebrate people who work to protect Africa’s natural heritage.</p>
      <p>Kate's late official engagement was the Royal Variety Performance earlier this week, when she looked stunning in an Alexander McQueen gown.</p>
      <p>It's been an extremely difficult week for the Royal Family after Prince Andrew announced he would be stepping back from royal duties.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-queen">The Queen</a> summoned Prince Andrew to Buckingham Palace to effectively sack him from royal duties after intense lobbying from his older brother Prince Charles.</p>
      <p>Andrew held crisis talks with his mum - reported to be "disappointed" and "unhappy" - and his brother before the Queen told her second-born child to step down.</p>
      <p>She then informed the wider Royal Family before the palace issued a bombshell statement on behalf of the scandal-hit prince, it was reported.</p>
