      <h1>Canada’s Trudeau sends Freeland on high-stakes mission to tame west</h1>
      <h2>Alberta native and leadership rival is given a make or break job by Canadian PM</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:34:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">Jason Kirby</a></address>
      <p>As Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland rose to prominence taking on US president Donald Trump and in the process became almost as high-profile as her boss Justin Trudeau. Now she has been given a job that could make or break her career — confronting the rising tide of anger and alienation in western Canada.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Canadian prime minister Mr Trudeau unveiled his new cabinet, a month after his Liberal party won a federal election but failed to secure enough seats to hold <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fc2dabfa-f47c-11e9-a79c-bc9acae3b654">majority control of parliament</a>.</p>
      <p>His party was completely shut out of the energy-rich provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, reflecting a backlash against the Trudeau government’s environmental policies. At the same time, the separatist Bloc Québécois party tripled its seat count in Quebec to become the third-largest federal party.</p>
      <p>With Canada more politically fractured than it has been in decades, Mr Trudeau has made Ms Freeland, an Alberta native, deputy prime minister and inter-governmental affairs minister, responsible for relations between Ottawa and provincial governments. Mr Trudeau said having Ms Freeland in “a strong position . . . will be very positive for national unity”.</p>
      <p>But with western voters concerned that they contribute more to the Canada federation than they receive, Ms Freeland faces a tough situation. “For Freeland to be successful there needs to be a willingness on the other side to compromise, and right now Alberta doesn’t feel in the mood to compromise,” said Stephen Carter, who served as chief of staff to former Alberta premier Alison Redford.</p>
      <blockquote>I did not take on this job to be a spokesmodel<cite>Chrystia Freeland, Canadian deputy prime minister</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Some analysts saw Ms Freeland’s appointment as a strategy by Mr Trudeau to contain a politician widely seen as one of his biggest rivals and a likely successor to the party leadership.</p>
      <p>Former British Columbia premier Christy Clark told Canadian radio Ms Freeland would be very good at the job, but “[Mr Trudeau] has given her probably the worst job in government right now. When you give someone a terrible job and you make them your deputy, it usually means you fear them as a potential opponent”.</p>
      <p>For Ms Freeland, the stakes are high, said Peter Loewen, a political science professor at the University of Toronto. “Prime minister Trudeau has given Ms Freeland a very difficult file, and a lot of her future success is going to rise or fall on this file,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Conservative party, which won more votes than the Liberals in the last election but fewer seats, quickly dismissed Ms Freeland’s appointment as a “PR campaign” adding “his downtown Toronto [member of parliament] spent the last four years at the cabinet table signing off on anti-energy Trudeau Liberal policies”.</p>
      <p>Yet others on the right see it as a positive move. Jason Lietaer, a Conservative strategist, said appointing Ms Freeland was Mr Trudeau’s “best available option” to address the west’s lack of representation in the Liberal government. “She brings credibility and clearly has the prime minister’s ear,” he added.</p>
      <p>But Mr Lietaer expressed concern about Ms Freeland’s workload. In addition to her duties as deputy PM and inter-governmental affairs minister, she will continue to be responsible for Canada-US relations and ensuring the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement gets ratified. Much of Ms Freeland’s success will depend on how much responsibility she is given to “set and execute the direction of government”, said Prof Loewen.</p>
      <p>For her part Ms Freeland struck back at suggestions she will not have the necessary powers to take action in her new role. “I did not take on this job to be a spokesmodel,” she said during her first broadcast interview after being sworn in.</p>

      <p>Ms Freeland has options to address the west’s concerns, Prof Loewen said, such as revisiting federal equalisation payments to the provinces.</p>
      <p>But Mr Carter warned that Alberta premier Jason Kenney, one of the Trudeau government’s loudest critics, had little to gain politically from resolving his dispute with Ottawa. “Jason Kenney knows that if he doesn’t have the foil of the federal government he’s really in trouble,” he said. “Because the province’s economic revival is his core selling point, and oil and gas is not going to rebound and give us the prosperity that we’ve had in the past.”</p>
      <p>Ms Freeland’s new duties are a far cry from the Davos circuit in which she has moved in recent years. As foreign minister Ms Freeland, a former deputy editor of the Financial Times who grew up on a farm in northern Alberta and earned degrees from Harvard and Oxford, was feted on the international stage.</p>
      <p>Ms Freeland’s name has been raised as a potential successor to Mr Trudeau on several occasions, most recently during the crisis that followed the publication of photos of Mr Trudeau wearing brownface and blackface make-up as recently as 2001.</p>
      <p>“At some point one of them is going to keep getting better, and she’s going to be the one who keeps getting better at the job,” said Prof Loewen. “That’s just going to build up more and more tension.”</p>
