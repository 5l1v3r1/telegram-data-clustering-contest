      <p>Koforidua, Nov. 20, GNA – The New Juaben North Municipal Assembly in collaboration with the Electoral Commission (EC) and The National Commission for Civic Education (NCCE) has organized a day’s workshop for all aspiring assembly members in Koforidua.</p>
      <p>The effort was to get members informed on the upcoming referendum and spread the message as they go about their campaign activities.</p>
      <p>Mrs Lydia Egyiri Sackey, New Juaben Municipal Officer of the EC, said since the referendum would be held on the same day as the Assembly and Unit Committee elections, the training was to build the capacity of the aspirants.</p>
      <p>She said there are several misinformation and misconceptions about the referendum in the public domain and urged the aspirants to endeavor to take time off their campaign activities and educate the public on the referendum and their civic responsibilities.</p>
      <p>The EC officer urged the media to verify any information from her outfit to ensure that the public was not misinformed and advised the aspirants to conduct their campaigns without derogatory remarks and name calling of their fellow contestants.</p>
      <p>Mr Ebenezer Acheampong, New Juaben North Municipal Director of NCCE, explained that the referendum was a ‘yes or no’ vote to decide whether the District level Elections as well as that of the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) should be voted or sponsored by political parties and urged the aspirants to use their platforms to communicate same to the public.</p>
      <p>He called on the assembly members to create more awareness on the referendum and the need for people to come out to vote to ensure a huge turnout of the public on December 17.</p>
      <p>Two of the aspirants Madam Victoria Agyemang and Madam Adwoa Owusua, said the training has given them more information about the referendum and pledged to use their campaign platforms to educate the public.</p>
