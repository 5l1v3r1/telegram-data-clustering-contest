      <h1>Sarson's Vinegar Nets You 50% off Fancy Fish and Chips This Black Friday</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:30:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>Sarson's partners up with London seafood restaurant Fish! to bring you half price black squid ink-battered fish and chips.</p>
      <p>A Black Friday sale that actually takes place on Black Friday, the deal extends to the first 100 portions served up at <a href="https://www.fishboroughmarket.com/">Fish!</a> in Borough Market, Cathedral Street. Usually priced at £18, you can get your tentacles on a serving of limited-edition black squid-ink battered fish and chips for just £9.</p>
      <p>To make good on the deal, just stroll into the restaurant on Friday, November 29 and ask for "Sarson’s Black ‘Fry’Day Deal of the Day". Be sure to pronounce the pun, or else you won't get the discount. Or so I'd like to think.</p>
      <p>The fish and chips will be accompanied by mushy peas, tartare sauce and "lashings of Sarson’s" of course. If you're not drowning that entire plate in malt vinegar, you're not doing it right.</p>
      <p>As well as free grub, you'll also be presented with a free bottle of Sarson’s vinegar, so you can bathe in it when you get home.</p>
