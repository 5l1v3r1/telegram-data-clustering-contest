      <p><b>UPDATE:</b> <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple-">Apple</a> abruptly canceled the Los Angeles premiere of its original film <i>The Banker</i>, which was generating buzz as a possible <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/oscars">Oscar</a> contender. The film, which was an Apple TV+ original, was scheduled to be shown at the American Film Institute before Apple pulled it from release. In a statement, the company said “Last week some concerns surrounding the film were brought to our attention. We, along with the filmmakers, need some time to look into these matters and determine the best next steps.”</p>
      <p><i>The Banker</i> showcases the true story of two African American men who hired a working-class to be the face of their successful real estate and banking operations in the ’60s. Apple continued in its statement they were “moved by the film’s entertaining and educational story about social change and financial literacy.”</p>
