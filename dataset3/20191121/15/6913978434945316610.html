      <p><b>BEIRUT — </b>Attacks by Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and air raids by his ally Russia killed at least 21 civilians including 10 children in rebel-held Idlib province on Wednesday, a monitoring group said.<br/><br/>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, in an updated toll, said a ground-to-ground missile fired by regime forces that hit a makeshift camp for the displaced near Qah village close to the border with Turkey killed 15 civilians, including six children, and wounded around 40 others.<br/><br/>The missile crashed near a maternity facility in the camp, it said.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, "Russian military aircraft" targeted the town of Maaret Al-Numan in the south of the province, the Observatory said, and "six civilians were killed, among them four children".<br/><br/>A number of people were wounded in the raid, some "in a critical state", and the toll there was likely to rise, the Britain-based monitor's head Rami Abdel Rahman reported.<br/><br/>A photographer saw rescue workers retrieve the dust-covered body of a girl from debris and place her in an ambulance.<br/><br/>The northwestern Idlib region is dominated by extremists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group (HTS), formerly the Syrian affiliate of Al-Qaeda.<br/><br/>Most of Idlib province remains out of the control of the Syrian regime, as do adjacent areas of Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces.<br/><br/>These areas are also home to other jihadist groups and rebels.<br/><br/>The Observatory has a wide network of sources on the ground and determines those responsible for such raids by the type of aircraft and weaponry used, as well as their flight plan.<br/><br/>Between the end of April and the end of August, Idlib was pounded ceaselessly by Syrian soldiers backed by Russian air power.<br/><br/>The Observatory estimates that nearly 1,000 civilians were killed in that period, and the UN says that more than 400,000 people were displaced.<br/><br/>Moscow announced a ceasefire at the end of August, but the Observatory says there have been sporadic attacks since then, and that dozens of civilians have been killed.<br/><br/>On Oct. 22, in his first visit to the embattled northwestern region since 2011, Assad said defeating militants there was the key to ending the country's eight-year-old civil war.<br/><br/>The war in Syria has killed more than 370,000 people and displaced millions. — AFP</p>
