      <p><b>RIYADH —</b> LuLu, the largest hypermarket chain in the Middle East, unveiled “Discover America”, a week-long showcase of high-quality food products from the land of the star-spangled banner, which was inaugurated by Alan Hallman, regional agricultural attache of the US Embassy, here, in the presence of Shehim Mohammed, director of LuLu Hypermarket Saudi Arabia, government officials, and LuLu dignitaries at LuLu Hypermarket Atyaf Mall, Yarmouk, Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Mohammed said: “As we pride ourselves for being the one-stop destination where the world comes to shop, we bring global flavors to our shoppers not only through our hypermarket offerings, but mainly through special festivals like ‘Discover America’.<br/><br/>“This festival will let our shoppers experience American culture through food and events. We are thankful for the unceasing support of the Embassy of the United States of America in organizing this event.<br/><br/>“Moreover, this event became successful with the hard work of our logistics and food sourcing office in the USA for ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality products at the most affordable prices all year round.”<br/><br/>LuLu, which has its own sourcing office in New Jersey, USA, has flown in more than 2,000 products in different categories, such as dairy essentials, breakfast cereals and oats, premium nuts, organic soy products, cheeses, baking needs, sugar-free fruit preserves, organic condiments, sauces, mixes, and more for this promotion. Apart from these, Lulu is also serving a range of freshly prepared foods, such as beef dishes with vegetable combos, baked pies and pastries, fresh salads, classic cookies, and much more.<br/><br/>“US food producers are the world leaders in quality, safety, and innovation,” said Hallman.<br/><br/>With 182 stores operating worldwide, LuLu has continuously been exerting its greatest efforts to provide and sustain the supply of global products at the best rates. With the excellent combination of high-quality offerings and organized logistics system, LuLu remains to be the favorite shopping destination in Saudi Arabia when it comes to a broader selection of international products.<br/><br/>Promotion is valid across LuLu stores in Saudi Arabia till Nov. 26. — SG</p>
