      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/martin-lewis">Martin Lewis</a> , the Money Saving Expert, has shared his shopping mantra to help bargain hunters stay out of financial trouble.</p>
      <p>The MSE founder and financial guru spoke out on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> daytime favourite Good Morning Britain today.</p>
      <p>Each year, scams surface around <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/black-friday">Black Friday</a> - and Brits could find themselves paying over the odds for goods - and losing out on money entirely.</p>
      <p>He told Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard, who were presenting the show: "So here is my mantra;</p>
      <p>"Ask yourself, 'do I need it?', 'is it worth it?' and 'have I checked if I can get it cheaper elsewhere?'</p>
      <p>"If the answer to any of them is 'no', don't buy it."</p>
      <p>Mr Lewis is a regular feature on a string of daytime ITV1 shows - including GMB, This Morning and Lorraine.</p>
      <p>This year, Black Friday falls on November 29 with Cyber Monday continuing the shopping frenzy on December 2.</p>
      <p>A huge array of retailers are already offering discounted products meaning you can start bargain hunting now.</p>
