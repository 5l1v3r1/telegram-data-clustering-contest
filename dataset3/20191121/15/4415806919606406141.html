      <h1>Verona Murphy 'deeply regrets' asylum seeker comments</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T15:33:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 15:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/elaine-loughlin/" target="_blank">By Elaine Loughlin</a></address>
      <p>Fine Gael's by-election candidate Verona Murphy has broken her silence to express "deep regret" over comments she made about asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>The Wexford candidate, who suggested asylum seekers who come to Ireland need to be "deprogrammed" as they may have been influenced by ISIS, has now said her comments were a "very poor choice of words".</p>
      <p>Speaking on South East Radio, Ms Murphy said: “I would like to say I deeply regret the words used in my interview. I have expressed and I wish to express again my understanding of the offence and hurt that I have caused by my comments and I wish to sincerely apologise."</p>
      <p>She added: “It is a learning curve, I intend to be better informed in the future and I did visit with the Syrian families in the centre in Dungarvan. I told them exactly what I had said. I asked for their forgiveness by making an apology and that was accepted.</p>
      <p>“I was hugely impressed after four and a half hours by these families and it is that knowledge that I will be imparting, an informed knowledge,” she said.</p>
