      <p>The Clippers’ 107-104 overtime victory over the Celtics will be remembered as the first game Kawhi Leonard and Paul George played together for Los Angeles. This Patrick Beverley flop, though, will be a close second.</p>
      <p>The Clippers guard is known as one of the more ferocious defenders in the NBA (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/28076023/russell-westbrook-patrick-beverley-guard-man">sorry, Russell Westbrook</a>), but this will not go on his highlight reel.  Beverley was guarding Jayson Tatum and crashes to the floor after Tatum grazes his face.</p>
      <p>The slo-mo ESPN replay clearly shows the hit was not as bad as Beverley acted.</p>
      <p>“Just watch Patrick Beverley’s reaction,” a laughing Doris Burke says as the replay airs.</p>
