      <p>If there’s anyone who knows how to build fast SUVs, it’s Mercedes-Benz. Since the mid-2000s, the German automaker has been cramming high-powered engines into their large and mid-sized people movers. So when the latest model of the GLE and the GLS debuted, it was only a matter of time before they received the AMG treatment.</p>

      <p>Now, they’re finally here. At the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show, Mercedes finally revealed the new GLE 63 S and the GLS 63. Both of these large SUVs are powered by the same 4.0-liter bi-turbo V8 engine which produces 603 horsepower and 850 Nm of torque paired with a nine-speed automatic transmission. They also pack an extra 21 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque thanks to the 48-volt EQ Boost starter-generator. 4Matic+ all-wheel drive ensures that power is sent to all four wheels when needed.</p>

      <p>The faster of the two models is the GLE 63 S with its lighter body. Going from 0 to 97 km/h just takes only 3.7 seconds. Meanwhile, the larger GLS 63 takes 4.1 seconds to do the same sprint. The top speed for both models is electronically limited to 280 km/h.</p>

      <p>Aside from adding extra power, the EQ Boost starter also helps improve fuel economy of the V8-powered SUVs. It also operates the AMG’s Active Ride Control technology that helps offset body roll. Large 6-piston calipers and rotors help bring the heavy SUVs to a stop.</p>

      <p>With regards to styling, both the GLE 63 S and the GLS 63 still look like their non-AMG counterparts. The most obvious changes to both models would have to be AMG’s signature Panamerica vertical front grill. Both models also feature a more aggressive body kit with overfenders and paired with a quad exhaust at the rear. 21-inch wheels are fitted onto the GLE and large 23-inch units are fitted for the GLS. </p>

      <p>Despite being the range-topping models of the GLE and GLS, there is still an extensive options list of being offered by Mercedes for both models. These options include the Burmester sound system, four-zone climate control on the GLE, and rear-seat entertainment for the GLS.</p>
