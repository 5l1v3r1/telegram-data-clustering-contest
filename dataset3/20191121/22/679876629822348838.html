      <p>An enormous statue of the Baby Jesus created by a church in rural Mexico has launched a series of internet memes in the Roman Catholic country.</p>
      <p>The Zoquite parish church in Zacatecas state says it wanted to draw attention to the traditional statue and simply ordered a figure about the size of its main hall, or nave.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But at just over 6.5 metres tall, the nappy-clad baby figure looks so large in a video posted on the church website that it appears able to step on the humans around it.</p>
      <p>Mexicans quickly created memes showing the looming baby threatening to invade cities or public gatherings, like Godzilla.</p>
      <p>Others noted the blue-eyed baby looks a lot like actor Nicolas Cage, or musician Phil Collins.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>While Baby Jesus figures are traditionally used in creche displays in the United States largely around Christmas, in many countries the figures are displayed all year.</p>
      <p>The reaction is similar to that of the notorious "restoration" of "Ecce Homo" ("Behold Man"), a fresco of Jesus at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Mercy near the Spanish town of Borja. The botched job by a local woman was ridiculed worldwide and became <a href="https://www.traveller.com.au/ecce-homo-scorned-artist-resurrects-spanish-town-of-borjas-economy-12800c">better known as "Behold the Monkey"</a>. </p>
