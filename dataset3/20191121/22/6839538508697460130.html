      <p>Frosty plumes of liquid nitrogen have covered a launch site after a SpaceX rocket exploded. Things didn’t go to plan for Elon Musk.</p>
      <p>The icy chemical was being used as part of a propellant test, and is at least -197C – and often much colder.</p>
      <p>Dramatic footage captured by the NasaSpaceflight blog shows the rocket blowing open during a test on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>A cloud of cryogenic fluid can be seen erupting from the vehicle’s upper bulkhead, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10394567/elon-musk-starship-spacecraft-liquid-nitrogen-test/"><i>The Sun</i></a><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10394567/elon-musk-starship-spacecraft-liquid-nitrogen-test/"> reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The cryogenic loading trial was part of the spaceship’s propellant testing, and appeared to go very wrong.</p>
      <p>In a statement, SpaceX said: “The purpose of today’s test was to pressurise systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected.</p>
      <p>“There were no injuries, nor is this a serious setback.”</p>

      <p>The most likely candidate for the fluid is liquid nitrogen, an extremely cold form of nitrogen used to rapidly cool objects.</p>
      <p>It’s also possible that the chemical was liquid oxygen, which turns from liquid to gas at -183C.</p>
      <p>In either case, the temperature of the fluids involved would’ve been very chilly.</p>
      <p>The Starship appeared to be largely intact after the event, although the structure would’ve been put under immense pressure.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Elon Musk revealed that his Starship spaceports will float 20 miles out to see.</p>
      <p>And passengers will be carted to them from the mainland via underground shuttles.</p>

      <p>Musk tweeted: “Most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth.”</p>
      <p>He wrote this while replying to a fan about how far reusable space travel had come within the last decade and stated that his Falcon rocket is around 80 per cent reusable.</p>
      <p>He said that currently the Falcon re-flight takes several days and requires boats.</p>
      <p>Musk’s Starship rockets are intended to be fully reusable.</p>
