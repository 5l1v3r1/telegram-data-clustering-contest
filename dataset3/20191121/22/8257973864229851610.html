      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Massachusetts on Thursday passed a law banning the sale of flavored tobacco and placing an excise tax on e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/H4196">bill</a> would make Massachusetts the first state to place a permanent ban on menthol cigarettes, impose a 75 percent tax on e-ciagarettes and order healthcare providers to pay for tobacco cessation programs in an effort to curb youth smoking.</p>
      <p>"Menthol is a flavor. It reduces the harshness of smoking, making it easier to start and harder to quit," Sen. John Keenan, one of the bill's sponsors, <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJohnFKeenan/status/1197286424787259395">wrote on Twitter</a> ahead of the vote. "Today, young people smoke menthol cigarettes more than any other group. A bill that does not ban menthol is a bill that does not protect our kids."</p>
      <p>The bill will now be sent to Republican Gov. Charlie Baker who has not indicated whether or not he will sign it into law.</p>
      <p>Baker has previously announced a temporary 4-month ban on vape sales in the state for both tobacco and marijuana e-cigarettes declaring the matter a public health emergency.</p>
      <p>Multiple states have imposed bans and other legislation on e-cigarettes and other vaping products as the United States has seen <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/21/Reported-US-vaping-deaths-taper-off-popcorn-lung-diagnosed-in-Canada/1481574360497/">49 vaping related deaths</a> and 2,290 lung injury cases.</p>
