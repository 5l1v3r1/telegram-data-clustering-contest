      <h1>You'll reportedly be able to buy Baby Yoda merchandise in time for the holiday season</h1>

      <p>Getting merchandise in time for Christmas, Baby Yoda is.</p>
      <p>Merchandise of everyone's favorite little green friend from <i>The Mandalorian</i>, the new Disney+ <i>Star Wars </i>series,<i> </i>will be going on sale for this holiday season, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/baby-yoda-apparel-accessories-toys-and-plush-are-coming.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain">CNBC reported Thursday</a>.</p>
      <p>That might have seemed like a sure bet from the very first appearance of the adorable creature, who isn't actually Yoda as a baby but has been given that moniker since no official name for the character or the character's species has been revealed. <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-toys/">But there were fears</a> Baby Yoda merchandise might not go on sale until after the holiday season, as Disney had apparently held back in an attempt to prevent leaks of the surprise character. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/frozen-star-wars-toys-hasbro/index.html">CNN just this morning</a> observed that Disney "appears to have missed a big opportunity to sell a bunch of 'Baby Yoda' <i>Star Wars</i> toys to boost its holiday toy sale numbers."</p>
      <p>But CNBC reports that "apparel and accessories featuring the yet unnamed creature will soon be available through Amazon, Zazzle, Target, Kohl's, Macy's, Hot Topic and Box Lunch," and these products "could arrive as early as Friday." Baby Yoda products are also headed to the Disney Store, ShopDisney, and to Disney Parks before the holidays as well, and "presales for toys and plush will be available in the coming weeks," the report says, though it's "uncertain when that merchandise will be shipped."</p>
      <p>Disney will be striking while the iron is hot, then, presumably covering all its bases with everything from Baby Yoda dolls to Baby Yoda mugs to Baby Yoda, well, fill in the blank. And for those who don't believe what a phenomenon Baby Yoda has become in just over a week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS_gLFOrjMw">that is why you fail</a>.</p>
