      <p>Congolese troops killed seven members of a militia who attacked its positions in two villages in the country's conflict-ridden east, the army said on on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Dozens of rival militia operate in Democratic Republic of Congo's North and South-Kivu provinces, including the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamist-rooted group blamed for killing hundreds.</p>
      <p>The area has been torn for more than two decades by armed conflicts fed by ethnic and land disputes, competition for control of a wealth of mineral resources and regional rivalries.</p>
      <p>"A (Mai-Mai) militia group on Tuesday, November 19, attacked the army's positions in Rusankuku and Kananda villages (in South-Kivu's Fizi region)," local military spokesman Captain Dieudonne Kasereka told AFP.</p>
      <p>Mai-Mai refers to a community-based militia in the DRC, which defends its territory against other armed groups.</p>
      <p>Kasereka said the attackers were pushed out of the villages and "seven militia bodies were identified". He said a soldier was also wounded in the assault.</p>
      <p>Gadi Mukiza, mayor of the Minembwe region in South-Kivu, also confirmed the attack, without giving further details.</p>
      <p>Since May, the area has seen a resurgence of ethnic violence over land disputes between the Banyamulenge tribe -- made up of Congolese Tutsi herders -- and the Bafuliro, Banyindu and Babembe farmers.</p>
      <p>In October, the UN mission in the DRC said several hundred people were forced to flee their homes, which were burned as a result of the violence.</p>
