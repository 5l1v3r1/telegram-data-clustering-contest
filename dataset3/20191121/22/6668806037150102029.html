      <h3>1. Kartik Aaryan movies - Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2011</h3>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/photos/pyaar-ka-punchnamas-success-bash-11019.html">Pyaar Ka Punchnama</a></b> Characters Rajat "Rajjo" Mridul (Kartik Aaryan), Nishant "Liquid" Agarwal (Divyendu Sharma) and Vikrant Chaudhary (Raayo S Bakhirta) are three friends living together in an apartment in Delhi. The tree of them fall in love with three women but have their fair share of problems in each of their relationships. While Neha (<b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/interviews/nushrat-bharucha-on-her-journey-in-bollywood-till-now-31967.html">Nushrat Bharucha</a></b>) uses Rajjo only for financial assistance. Vikrant is in love with Rhea (Sonali Sehgall), who can’t seem to get over her boyfriend from the past five years. And Liquid has fallen for Charu (Ishita Raj Sharma) but she’s still in an on and off relationship with a man. Initially, everything seems to be going fine in their relations. The three of them decide to go for a little trip with their ladies and that’s where the problems begin to creep in. Each of them has their own set of problems and begin to feel a lack of respect from their partners in their relationship. <b>Kartik Aaryan movie - Pyaar Ka Punchnama</b> was termed as the sleeper hit of the year and the biggest reason behind the film’s success was that it was able to form a deep connect with today’s youth through their portrayal of complications in a relationship today. <i>Kartik Aaryan’s monologue which basically was a rant about the problems in his relationship became immensely popular from the film</i>. In fact, the audience seemed to love it so much that we see a little rant in almost every Kartik Aaryan movie since then.</p>

      <p><b>2. Akaash Vani 2013</b><br/><br/><i>Akaash Vani was Kartik Aaryan’s second release and also the second time he featured alongside Nushrat Bharucha</i>. The film starts off as being an easy-breezy romantic love story featuring Akaash (Kartik Aaryan) and Vaani (Nushrat Bharucha). The two fall in love and want to get married but a long-distance relationship and some misunderstandings prevent them from going ahead with their decision. Vaani ends up marrying a man of her parent's choice. Late on, that man physically and mentally abuses her and treats her merely as a sex object. Vaani eventually realizes that she cannot be with such a man and asks for a divorce. Akash, who was still waiting to reunite with her one day, decides that he cannot mess up their relation again and decides to marry her. The Kartik Aaryan movie felt too stretched out in certain places which also might be the major reason for the film’s failure.</p>

      <p><b>3. Kaanchi: The Unbreakable 2014 </b><br/><br/>In a society where women are often subject to injustice, <b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/reviews/movie-review-kaanchi-5976.html">Kaanchi</a></b> was a story that served as an inspiration. The film revolved around a woman named Kaanchi (Mishti), who lives in a village named Koshampu along with her sister and mother. Kaanchi loves her childhood friend Binda (Kartik Aaryan). Their parents agreed to get them married and Kaanchi begins to visualize a happy life ahead. But, an industrialist family named Kakda causes trouble in her life. Sushant Kakda (Rishabh Sinha) is the son of the Kakda family, who falls in love with Kaanchi. After Kaanchi rejects him, he ends up killing Binda in front of her on their wedding day. How Kaanchi goes about getting her revenge for the injustice forms the crux of the film. The biggest problem in the film is that the story’s approach is confusing. While at times it tries to be a love story and at times it makes itself to be a revenge drama. <i>This leads to the Kartik Aaryan movie being a complete mess</i>.</p>

      <p><b>4. Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 2015</b><br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/reviews/movie-review-pyaar-ka-punchnama-2_-10856.html">Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2</a></b> was another installment to the <b>Punchnama series</b> and followed the same premise as the original. Just like the original, we see three close friends who begin dating three women. After the honeymoon phase, as they call it, problems begin to creep up in the relations. Just like the first film, this Kartik Aaryan movie also managed to form a strong connection with the audience which was pretty evident in the box-office collections. <i>The sequel also featured a Kartik Aaryan monologue just like the first one, which also went on to become pretty popular amongst the audience</i>.</p>

      <p><b>5. Guest Iin London 2017</b><br/><br/>The film is a comedy revolving around <b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/photos/kartik-aaryan-and-kriti-kharbanda-host-guest-iin-londons-screening-for-friends-22100.html">Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Kharbanda’s</a></b> character who's in a relationship in London. Ananya (<b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/news/bollywood/kriti-kharbanda-talks-about-her-rumoured-relationship-with-pulkit-samrat-36830.html">Kriti Kharbanda</a></b>) is a UK citizen who’s offered 7000 pounds by Aryan (Kartik Aaryan) to agree to a fake marriage since he’s looking to secure citizenship. At this time, Aryan’s relatives turn up in London unannounced. These uninvited guests turn their life into complete havoc which proves to be a laugh riot for the audience. The Kartik Aaryan movie offered nothing new to the audience and probably was the biggest reason behind the film’s failure.</p>

      <p><b>6. Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety 2018</b><br/><br/><b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/reviews/bollywood-movies/movie-review-sonu-ke-titu-ki-sweety-26750.html">Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety</a></b> was another <b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/news/bollywood/exclusive-heres-everything-you-want-to-know-about-luv-ranjans-next-sonu-ke-titu-ki-sweety-25701.html">Luv Ranjan</a></b> project that featured Kartik Aaryan and Nushrat Bharucha. <i>The Kartik Aaryan movie was a story surrounding the theme of romance vs bromance</i>. Sonu (Kartik Aaryan) and Titu (Sunny Singh) are shown to be best friends living together. Titu faces heartbreak multiple times and decides to go with a girl that his family picks for him. Enter Sweety (Nushrat Bharucha), a sweet, innocent, beautiful woman that Titu and his family instantly fall in love with. Everyone seems to be impressed by Sweety but Sonu. Sonu has an intuition that she’s a con and never seems to buy her ‘act’. The entire film is entertaining and there’s rarely a dull moment from the audience. Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety went on to become <b>Kartik Aaryan’s biggest hit</b>.</p>

      <p><b>7. Luka Chuppi 2019</b><br/><br/>Live-in relationships might be something that is common in the country currently, but even today adults hide this from their parents and society as it’s not a part of the Indian culture. <b><a href="https://www.filmfare.com/reviews/bollywood-movies/movie-review-luka-chuppi-32687.html">Luka Chuppi</a></b> told the story of one such couple. Guddu (Kartik Aaryan) and Rashmi (Kriti Sanon) work for a news channel in Mathura. While they both love and care for each other, Rashmi suggests that they should try living in a relationship to giving them a taste of married life before they take the leap. They’re assigned a special project in Gwalior where they take an apartment on rent to give their idea a go. One day, Guddu’s family is tipped off about his doings and the couple claim they’re married to avoid the criticism. <b>Kartik Aaryan's movie was a fun light-hearted comedy</b> that is sure to make for an entertaining watch.</p>
