      <h1>Controversial housing development between Derby suburbs gets approval</h1>
      <h2>Residents have voiced their concerns</h2>

      <p>Plans for a massive 800-home <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/derby-news/hundreds-new-homes-built-between-3547148">development between Alvaston and Chellaston</a> have been given the green light despite objections.</p>
      <p>An application for the housing development, known as Snelsmoor Grange, was granted by <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-city-council">Derby City Council’s</a> planning committee tonight, Thursday, November 21.</p>
      <p>It is set to be built in phases and the developers are looking for full planning permission to start work on the first 245 homes.</p>
      <p>They are also seeking outline permission for the remaining 555 houses as part of what is called a hybrid planning application.</p>
      <p>It will be sited on land to the north of Snelsmoor Lane and south of Field Lane at Boulton Moor.</p>
      <p>To the east of the site, within South Derbyshire District Council's area, is another proposed housing site, known as Boulton Moor 2.</p>
      <p>The development also comprises of a country park and a primary school and will be accessed from a new roundabout on Snelsmoor Lane.</p>
      <p>The school will be sited on the edge of the green wedge and accessed from a new junction off Field Lane.</p>
      <p>The proposed country park will form the retained green wedge and will be located between the proposed housing and the recently completed Fellow Lands Way development.</p>
      <p>It will also contain a series of footpaths, cycleways, play areas, wildflower meadows and public orchards.</p>
      <p>Tony Chambers-Kirk, owner of End Cottage Kennels, in Alvaston, addressed his concerns over the planned development at the meeting.</p>
      <p>He said: “The use of the footpath by the public will disturb the dogs and cause them to bark.</p>
      <p>“If this happens in the early morning, late evening or in the night this may disturb our new neighbours which may force them to complain about noise.”</p>
      <p>He also raised concerns over potential security issues.</p>
      <p>Another member of the public, Miss Warrent, urged members of the committee to build new houses away from green land.</p>
      <p>She said: “When you say affordable, what do you mean? I can’t afford them.</p>
      <p>“This site will rip up the environment and we are all worried about it. We are concerned.</p>
      <p>“Why don’t you develop social housing that we can actually rent?</p>
      <p>“We all know there is lots of traffic happening, if you would just reject these 800 houses a lot of people would be on your side.</p>
      <p>“Things are changing out there. Please support us.”</p>
      <p>The planning application was first lodged with Derby City Council six years ago.</p>

      <p>Since the original application, dating from 2013, in response to the then draft allocation of the emerging local housing plan, the proposal has undergone a lengthy period of negotiations and amendments.</p>
      <p>During that time, the council has received 41 public representations, one in support of the proposal and the others citing objections.</p>
      <p>These objections included the detrimental impact of the development on the green wedge and Green Belt; further development in the area cannot be sustained; loss of hedgerows and impact on wildlife; insufficient community facilities such as health centres; out-of-date traffic study; detrimental impact on traffic in "already congested Chellaston" and the impact of drainage plans on existing homes.</p>
