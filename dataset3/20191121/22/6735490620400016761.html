      <p>“Everybody in this country’s an immigrant,” Craig said. “That’s what the country’s built upon. We can’t forget it. We can’t just dismiss it … but it’s difficult, and it takes thought, and it takes smart people thinking about it instead of dividing people along party lines … and also along this anger that kind of builds up.”</p>
      <p>“It needs to be discussed… and that’s hard,” he continued. “Good things are hard to do. I’m incredibly proud to be part of this, to have an American passport and call myself an immigrant in this country.”</p>
