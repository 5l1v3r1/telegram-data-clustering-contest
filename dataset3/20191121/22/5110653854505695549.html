      <p>It'll be in Babcock's bank account.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old joined the Maple Leafs in 2015, signing the richest contract for a head coach in NHL history. That deal still has a substantial term remaining, meaning Babcock will be getting paid handsomely while not doing anything.</p>
      <p>We should all be so lucky.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But just how much are the Leafs still on the hook for? Sporting News breaks down the numbers below.</p>
      <h3>What were the terms of Mike Babcock's contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs?</h3>
      <p>When Babcock joined the Maple Leafs on May 20, 2015, he put his signature on what is still the single biggest financial commitmentfor an NHL head coach. The eight-year deal, worth $50 million total, is almost double the second-bestoverall compensation package for a bench boss — Joel Quenneville's current<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/panthers-move-quickly-hire-joel-quenneville-new-coach/boyq73ee7sf61bzgv6rgbh5v5">five-year, $26.25 million contract</a> with the Florida Panthers pales in comparison.</p>
      <h3>How much did Mike Babcock earn with the Toronto Maple Leafs this season?</h3>
      <p>We know that Babcock's annual salary was $6.25 million, so if we divide that by 82 regular-season games it means the coach was pulling in $76,219.51 per game.</p>
      <p>Babcock was terminated by the Leafs 23 games into the current campaign, earning him a cool $1,753,048.78 between opening day and Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>How much do the Toronto Maple Leafs owe Mike Babcock?</h3>
      <p>Using the per-game payout calculated above, we can surmise that Babcock is still owed nearly $4.5 million ($4,496,951.22, to be exact) for the remainder of this season.</p>
      <p>His contract with the Leafs was set to last through the following three seasons as well, so if we add the $4.5 million from the rest of the current campaign to the $18.75 million he's due for 2020-21 through 2022-23, we come up with a grand total of <i>$23.25 million</i>.</p>
      <p>That's a lot of dough.</p>
