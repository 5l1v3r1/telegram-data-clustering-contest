      <p>Google’s slow and steady march to assist banking providers with integrating Google Pay into its product offerings is continuing. Overnight Google updated the list of supported banks in Australia and added 5 more Aussie providers.</p>
      <p>The 5 new banks are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.bankfirst.com.au/googlepay">Bank First</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.boqspecialist.com.au/personal-banking/credit-cards/Google-pay">BOQ Specialist</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.humebank.com.au/news/announcements/google-pay-now-with-hume-bank">Hume</a>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://www.qbank.com.au/googlepay">QBank </a>and</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.qudosbank.com.au/GooglePay">QUDOS</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the new banks offer various combinations of credit and debit cards for use with the service. With so many smaller banks joining the mobile payment space it really shines a light on the bigger players who still don’t support services like Google Pay.</p>
