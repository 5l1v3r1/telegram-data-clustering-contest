      <h1>Alabama To Honor Redshirt Junior On Senior Day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:18:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Alabama star linebacker Terrell Lewis has been a critical piece for the Crimson Tide’s defense over the past few years. Many expect this to be his last season with Alabama before he moves on to the NFL.</p>
      <p>That speculation has seemingly been confirmed. Lewis, a redshirt junior, will take part in Alabama’s Senior Day this Saturday.</p>
      <p>It’s clear that this will be the linebacker’s final home game with the Crimson Tide.</p>

      <p>Lewis battled several injuries during his freshman and sophomore campaigns. But he’s been able to play in nine games this season, wreaking havoc along the way.</p>
      <p>The junior linebacker has 30 tackles, 10.5 tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks in nine games this season. He’s among the statistical leaders in the SEC conference in regards to sacks and tackles for loss.</p>
      <p>Saturday will certainly be a special moment for Lewis and the rest of Alabama’s seniors.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide are set to face Western Carolina on Saturday in a tune-up game before the Iron Bowl on Nov. 30. Nick Saban’s squad is on the outside looking in when it comes to the College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Alabama is currently No. 5 in the latest rankings. With Mac Jones in at quarterback – due to Tua Tagovailoa’s season ending injury – he’ll have to impress the playoff committee on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Alabama-Western Carolina kicks off at noon E.T. on ESPN.</p>
