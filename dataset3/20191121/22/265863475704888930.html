      <h1>Demi Lovato Confuses Fans After She Shows Off Her Baby Bump On Instagram</h1>

      <p><a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/demi-lovato-goes-instagram-official-with-model-austin-wilson-340467/">Demi Lovato</a> recently went Instagram official with model Austin Wilson, and the new relationship surprised fans because just a few days prior she was linked to <i>Bachelorette</i> alum Mike Johnson. But this week, she confused fans completely when she posted a selfie on Instagram that featured the <i>Sorry Not Sorry</i> singer cradling a baby bump. Is Demi Lovato pregnant?</p>
      <p>Lovato posted a selfie that featured her wearing a black and pink polka dot dress which showed off her belly, and fans seemingly ignored the caption because they were so shocked by the image.</p>

      <p>One fan wrote, “I was shook for a moment,” while another added, “I almost just screamed.”</p>
      <p>If the fans would have taken the time to read the caption where Lovato wrote, “Real or fake?” and then added the hashtags #WillAndGrace and #MeetJenny, they would have realized that Lovato has a guest starring role in the final season of the NBC sitcom <i>Will &amp; Grace,</i> and the baby bump was not real. Instead, she was wearing a fake bump to play the role of Jenny.</p>
      <p><i>Entertainment Weekly</i> revealed this past summer that Lovato would appear in three episodes this season, and the singer’s character would be a “guarded gal who comes into the life of Will in unexpected ways.” However, neither NBC, <i>Will &amp; Grace</i> producers, nor Lovato revealed that the character would be pregnant.</p>
      <p>With Will (Eric McCormack) desperately wanting to become a father this season, it’s possible that Lovato’s Jenny could be his surrogate. But, that won’t be clear until the episodes air because no one is giving away any secrets about Lovato’s character.</p>

      <p>When she made it to the set to shoot her first episode back in August, Lovato posted a pic with McCormack, Debra Messing (Grace), Megan Mullally (Karen), and Sean Hayes (Jack), and she wrote in the caption, “They’re the dream team. Honored to be a part of this cast. Last night was amazing and I can’t wait to return for more!!! Thank you.”</p>
      <p>It appears that Lovato is doing great just 16 months after she nearly lost her life due to an accidental overdose. She seems to be happy in a new relationship and her career is getting back on track. Not only is she starring on <i>Will &amp; Grace</i>, but she is also working on new music. Just this week, her manager Scooter Braun posted videos of Demi Lovato in the recording studio.</p>
