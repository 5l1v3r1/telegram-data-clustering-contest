      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>The Union transport ministry is likely to intervene into the affairs of Telangana State Road Transport Corporation as well as demands of the striking Road Transport Corporation workers.</p>
      <p>The chances of the ministry intervening are high after BJP’s Lok Sabha members from Telangana, Bandi Sanjay Kumar, Arvind Dharmapuri and Soyam Bapurao, led by union minister of state for home G. Kishan Reddy, met Union minister for transport Nitin Gadkari at Delhi on Thursday and sought his intervention into the demands raised by RTC workers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The BJP leaders spent more than 40 minutes with Gadkari and pointed out that the state government is making moves to privatise RTC routes, while leasing out properties of RTC to private organisations owned by TRS leaders.</p>
      <p>Sources disclosed that while the meeting was on, the Union minister tried to reach Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao over phone but did not succeed. The MPs told Gadkari that the centre holds 31 per cent of shares in APSRTC and its assets and liabilities are yet to be divided between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana post division of the united state.</p>
      <p>Kishan Reddy told media later that Gadkari responded positively to their request of doing justice to RTC workers. He disclosed that the union transport minister has assured that a meeting of his ministry’s officials and TSRTC management will be called within 10 days. The union minister of state for home asserted that the Centre has every right to intervene into the RTC affairs as it has a share in the RTC.</p>
