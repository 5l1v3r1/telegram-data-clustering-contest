      <h1>Westpac has clear weaknesses: PM Morrison </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:49:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>The prime minister has ramped up pressure on the Westpac board after the bank was ensnared in a major money laundering and child exploitation scandal.</p>
      <p>Scott Morrison has demanded embattled Westpac executives take decisive action to address “clear weaknesses” at a board meeting on Friday.</p>
      <p>“They have got to take the calls that I think reassure people’s confidence in the bank’s systems and the processes they have, and that there is accountability that is at work in these institutions,” he told 3AW radio.</p>
      <p>Australia’s financial crime watchdog has lodged a statement of claim in the Federal Court accusing Westpac of 23 million breaches of money laundering laws.</p>
      <p>AUSTRAC claims there are 12 instances the bank could have intervened to stop child exploitation in Southeast Asia, but did not have the systems in place.</p>
      <p>The board is meeting on Friday morning as pressure builds for heads to roll.</p>
      <p>“I would like to see at this board meeting and the many board meetings that will follow a confident plan to address firstly the clear weaknesses they’ve had in their systems that have allowed this to take place,” Mr Morrison said.</p>
      <p>“And secondly, there has to be some understanding of the accountability for when these things happen.”</p>
