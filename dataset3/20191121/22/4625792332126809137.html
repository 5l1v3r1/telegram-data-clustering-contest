      <h1>Democrat congressman commends Fiona Hill for enduring 'epic mansplaining' from Republican</h1>

      <p>Rep. Sean Maloney told impeachment witness Fiona Hill that he had appreciation for her long suffering with House Republicans near the conclusion of her testimony.</p>
      <p>"Thank you for being here. Dr. Hill, first of all, I thought that was some epic mansplaining that you were forced to endure by my colleague, Mr. Turner, and I want you to know some of us think it was inappropriate," the New York Democrat said. "But I appreciate your forbearance."</p>
      <p>The comment came during the fifth day of public impeachment testimony. Rep. Michael Turner had railed against Hill, a former National Security Council official, for giving "hearsay" testimony.</p>
      <p>The comment came during a contentious hearing in which Hill and David Holmes, a career diplomat, testified in front of the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>Along with her comments about President Trump's handling of foreign policy with Ukraine, Hill told the committee that the <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/impeachment-witness-fiona-hill-russia-tried-to-damage-both-trump-and-clinton">Russians had targeted both Hillary Clinton</a> and Trump to damage whichever candidate became president.</p>
      <p>"The goal of the Russians was really to put whoever became the president, by trying to tip their hands on one side of the scale, under a cloud," she said. "They seed misinformation, they seed doubt, they have everybody questioning the legitimacy of a presidential candidate, be it President Trump or potentially President [Hillary] Clinton, that they would pit one side of our electorate against the other, that they would pit one party against the other."</p>
