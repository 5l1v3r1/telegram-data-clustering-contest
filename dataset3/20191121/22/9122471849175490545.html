      <h1>Baseball Writer Unveils Controversial 2020 Hall Of Fame Ballot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:52:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this year, Mariano Rivera became the <a href="https://thespun.com/more/mlb/mariano-rivera-is-the-first-unanimous-hall-of-famer-in-mlb-history">first unanimous Hall of Famer</a> in Major League Baseball history. After decades in which voters operated with a ridiculous unwritten rule in which no player would receive 100-percent of the vote. There’s some speculation that his former New York Yankees teammate Derek Jeter could receive the same treatment, and there is at least some indication that he could be on that trajectory.</p>
      <p>Jeter’s numbers aren’t nearly as undeniable as Rivera, who is pretty indisputably the greatest player ever at his position. Still, given his stature within the Yankees dynasty in the 1990s and as one of the best modern MLB shortstops, he’s a pretty obviously Hall of Famer.</p>
      <p>He’s not the only one on this year’s ballot though. The steroid era complicates things, but superstars like Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Manny Ramirez, and Sammy Sosa remain out of the Hall of Fame, almost entirely due to their ties to steroids.</p>
      <p>Hall of Fame voters are allowed to pick up to 10 players on their ballots every year. While not everyone picks 10 players every year, usually there are at least a few votes on there. That isn’t the case for former <i>Newsday </i>writer Steven Marcus, who unveiled his ballot today.</p>
      <p>His only vote is going to Derek Jeter.</p>

      <p>Ryan Thibodeaux, who tracks Baseball Hall of Fame ballots, has spotted others from Lynn Henning of <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/sports/mlb/tigers/2019/11/20/heres-my-six-baseball-hall-fame-including-derek-jeter/4248301002/"><i>The Detroit News</i></a>, who also voted for Bonds, Clemens, Scott Rolen, Curt Schilling, and Larry Walker.</p>
      <p>Tony Massarotti of 98.5 The Sports Hub in Boston <a href="https://985thesportshub.com/episodes/felger-mazz-celtics-clippers-preview-and-the-mlb-hall-of-fame-ballot-hour-1/">is voting for</a> Bonds, Clemens, Jeter, and Ramirez.</p>
      <p>Marcus is catching plenty of heat on Twitter for leaving the rest of his ballot blank, especially with guys like Larry Walker, who has a very good Hall of Fame argument but is on his final year of eligibility, still out there. If enough of the old guard maintains the standards that have held back guys from the steroid era, Jeter may be in a small Hall of Fame class, if not one all his own.</p>
