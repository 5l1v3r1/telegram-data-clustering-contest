      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:25:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chris-brown">Chris Brown</a> has reportedly welcomed his second child with his ex-girlfriend Ammika Harris.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/21/chris-brown-second-child-boy/">TMZ</a> , the singer's former partner has given birth to a baby boy, their first child together.</p>
      <p>Chris, 30, is already dad to daughter Royalty, five, who he shares with his ex Nia Guzman.</p>
      <p>It's thought that they've both subtly announced the birth on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Chris shared a snap of himself wearing a hoodie with the word "Born" printed around the hood, and she posted on her Instagram story: "I was in love, when I first saw you."</p>
      <p>The star also shared a black and white snap of himself smiling and looking down at something off camera, captioning it with a date "11-10-2019"</p>

      <p>The US site first reported in August that Chris was expecting another baby.</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Chris' representatives for comment.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Chris furiously lashed out at women who were offended by his lyrics.</p>
      <p>One fan said she felt discriminated against because of some of the things he's been singing about lately.</p>
      <p>One woman took to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to share some of his song lyrics for track Need A Stack that read: "Only wanna f**k black b*****s with the nice hair"</p>

      <p>She said: "So, I've been a Chris Brown fan for atleast half of my life. IN HIS RECENT SONG FROM HIS ALBUM (Need A Stack) he said 'I only f**k black b*****s with the nice hair' and I just wanted to know, what is nice hair..?"</p>
      <p>Another said: "So is this considered a 'preference' or 'discrimination'. Listen we all have preferences I'll give you that. Never will I discriminate against my own kind."</p>
      <p>He ranted: "Weird ass angry people. Sincerely, from the bottom of my balls ... I DONT GIVE A F**K BOUT YALL NEGATIVE BOOTYFACE ASS B*****S.</p>
