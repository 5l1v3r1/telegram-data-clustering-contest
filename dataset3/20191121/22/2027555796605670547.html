      <p>A couple in Banakal have been successfully cultivating mushrooms in one of the rooms of their house. </p>
      <p>Francis D’Souza was a photographer a decade ago. However, when photography became challenging in this competitive era, he took up mushroom cultivation and achieved success in it. </p>
      <p>One needs to maintain cleanliness for cultivating mushroom, says D’Souza. “The mushroom cultivation will change the course of life with an increase in demand for it.</p>
      <p>Naveen of ICICI Bank trains those who are interested in cultivating mushroom, and also provides needed guidance,” said Sunitha D’Souza, wife of Francis. </p>
      <p>‘’With a kg of spawns of mushroom, one can harvest 10 kg to 15 kg. A kg of mushrooms fetches Rs 200 in the market. Mushroom is known for its vitamins., and its cultivation can be a source of livelihood even for unemployed,” said Francis. </p>
      <p>“Even physically challenged can also take up mushroom cultivation. A proposal has been submitted to the Deputy Commissioner to promote mushroom cultivation. If the government supports mushroom cultivation, then many can take up self-employment,” he said. </p>
      <p>Spawns of mushrooms are sown in polythene bags. The mushroom beds are incubated in a room.</p>
