      <h1>Hearts face Daniel Stendel fight as head coach target 'wants English job'</h1>
      <h2>The German has been lined-up as a potential successor to Craig Levein at Tynecastle.</h2>

      <p>Hearts face a fight to convince Daniel Stendel to replace <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/craig-levein">Craig Levein</a> as head coach, with a report stating that he'd rather stay in England.</p>
      <p>The German has been interviewed for the job at Tynecastle, and is currently the odds-on favourite to be the next man in the dugout.</p>
      <p>He's still under contract at Barnsley and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hearts-fc">Hearts</a> would have to pay compensation, but owner Ann Budge has previously made clear that would not be an issue.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4981640/hearts-fc-news-daniel-stendel/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574375607">Sun</a> though the Jambos will have to push the boat out to get Stendel as his preference is to find another job in England.</p>

      <p>After being sacked by the Tykes just months after leading them to promotion, the 45-year-old is determined to prove his worth south of the border.</p>
      <p>To do so he may be willing to take the rest of the season off after being place on gardening leave by Barnsley.</p>
      <p>Austin MacPhee will take the team for Saturday's trip to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> but his own position at the club remains unclear.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>understands <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ann-budge">Ann Budge</a> has yet to begin interviewing for the sporting director job, a role which has been newly created after Levein left his role as director of football following his removal as manager.</p>
