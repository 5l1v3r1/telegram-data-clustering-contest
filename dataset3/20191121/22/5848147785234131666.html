      <h1>Prince Andrew subpoena may be ‘imminent’ despite his retreat from public life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:11:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/kate-halfpenny/" target="_blank">Kate Halfpenny</a></address>
      <p>Forced by the Queen to <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/21/queen-unity-prince-andrew/">retreat from public life</a>, Prince Andrew is reportedly preparing to give formal evidence to a US criminal investigation into the activities of late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace is understood to be bracing for the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-loses-spin-doctor/">Duke of York</a> to be issued with a subpoena by US authorities, according to <i><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-quits-public-life-prepares-give-evidence-epstein/">The Telegraph</a>.</i></p>
      <p>It would require Andrew to give <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-testify-epstein/">testimony under oath</a> about his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>The summons is “imminent”, according to sources.</p>
      <p>It comes as US lawyers for Epstein’s victims urged the duke to co-operate with investigators, insisting he ” was simply not credible” in the widely criticised BBC interview.</p>
      <p>American lawyer Lisa Bloom tweeted she has been working with five victims.</p>
      <p>“He and his staff must co-operate with all investigations, show up for civil depositions and trials, and produce all documents,” Ms Bloom said.</p>
      <p>“We are just getting started,” she added.</p>

      <p>And in a further blow, the duke’s name has also appeared in a trove of sealed documents detailing new Epstein allegations, <i>The Telegraph</i> reports.</p>
      <p>A US judge will reportedly decide within weeks whether to unseal more than 3000 pages of evidence that formed part of a defamation lawsuit in 2015.</p>
      <p>Epstein, who killed himself in a New York jail in August, was close enough to Andrew to be invited to his daughter Princess Beatrice’s 18th birthday party after he was charged with child sex offences.</p>
      <p>Still reeling from the <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/people-entertainment/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-epstein-bbc-interview/">dreadful backfire of his BBC <i>Newsnight</i> interview</a>, the prince took the unprecedented step of cancelling all royal engagements for the “foreseeable future”.</p>
      <p>He announced the decision in a November 20 statement released on palace social media accounts that said he “deeply sympathised” with Epstein’s alleged victims.</p>
      <p>“Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigation, if required,” Andrew said.</p>

      <p>The palace declined to comment on the subpoena claims.</p>
      <p>Immediately after effectively sacking her third child on her 72nd wedding anniversary, the Queen headed out for an engagement.</p>
      <p>Chatting with Sir David Attenborough at an awards ceremony, she showed no signs of the crisis engulfing her family.</p>

      <p>Despite <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/world/2019/11/20/guards-slept-surfed-net-when-jeffrey-epstein-died/">Epstein’s death – </a>over which two prison guards are facing charges of falsifying records – the FBI is reportedly still interviewing alleged Epstein victims as part of a probe into potential co-conspirators.</p>
      <p>Andrew, 59, has denied knowledge of Epstein’s activities and has repeatedly refuted allegations by Australian woman Virginia Roberts Giuffre she was <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/11/10/prince-andrew-epstein-jail/">forced to have sex with him three times</a> in 2001.</p>
      <p>“The victims deserve justice and they will get it,” US Attorney-General William Barr told a law enforcement conference in New Orleans shortly after Epstein’s suicide.</p>
      <p>“Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit.”</p>
      <p>Andrew’s <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/entertainment/celebrity/2019/09/30/prince-andrew-royal-status-epstein/">royal status will not protect him</a> from a subpoena, according to Anna Rothwell, a lawyer at British law firm Corker, Binning.</p>
      <p>He is “not entitled to any form of immunity by virtue of his position as a member of the Royal family,” and he would be “vulnerable to extradition”, Ms Rothwell told <i>The Times</i>.</p>
      <p>Lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents one of Epstein’s accusers, told ITV’s <i>Good Morning Britain</i> that now Andrew has been “in the court of public opinion, he should testify to the FBI”.</p>
      <p>Her stance was echoed by second lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents five alleged Epstein victims.</p>
      <p>“It’s more likely the authorities are going to want to speak to him now. And they should want to,” she told a BBC news show.</p>

      <p>The removal of Andrew from public life is “without precedent in modern times,” said BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to see what will bring him back. Right now the humiliation is complete. And the monarchy is shaken.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/letter-to-the-times-casts-doubt-on-when-duke-of-york-met-epstein-c6j957t8b"><i>The Times</i></a> claimed a letter it was sent in March 2011 by Andrew’s private secretary casts doubt on the duke’s claims to <i>Newsnight</i> he first met Epstein in 1999.</p>
      <p>Alastair Watson wrote to the newspaper to deny reports the duke was a friend of Saif Gaddafi, son of late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.</p>
      <p>He also commented on Andrew and Epstein, saying, “The Duke has known Mr Epstein since being introduced to him in the early 1990s.”</p>
