      <p>AUD/JPY keeps it low after the Australian Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data while taking rounds to 73.73 during early Friday’s Asian session.</p>
      <p>Australia’s November month Markit/Commonwealth Bank <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Manufacturing PMI</a> crossed 49.8 forecasts but slipped beneath 50.1 prior. Further, Services PMI declined to 49.5 versus 53.5 expected and 50.1 earlier. As a result, the Composite PMI dropped to 49.5 from 50.0 prior.</p>
      <p>With this, the quote stays below near-term descending trend line while taking rounds to 50% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> retracement level of October month upside, at 73.70.</p>
      <p>While a downtick below 73.30 shifts sellers’ focus to a monthly low of 73.35 and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of 73.23, multiple bottoms marked during mid-October, near 73.00, can question bears afterward.</p>
      <p>If prices slip below 73.00, 72.50 and the previous month low around 71.70 will be in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, an upside clearance of 74.00, comprising the aforementioned <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> line, can propel price to 74.30 horizontal line including October-end low and the recent highs.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that the pair’s successful rise above 74.30 enables buyers to keep a tab on 75.00 while aiming for 75.30/40 and the monthly top close to 75.70 afterward.</p>
