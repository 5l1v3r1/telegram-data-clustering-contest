      <h1>Limerick All-Ireland winner Paul Browne retires from inter-county game</h1>
      <h2>Browne was vice-captain when Limerick lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup last year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:42:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Limerick hurler Paul Browne has announced his retirement from the inter-county game. <br/><br/>Browne, 30, was vice-captain when Limerick lifted the Liam MacCarthy Cup last year - bridging a 45-year gap to their last All-Ireland SHC title triumph. <br/><br/>However the Bruff midfielder, having played in three of the four games in the Munster championship that summer, suffered a cruciate ligament injury at the end of June that year and missed out on the successful All-Ireland charge. <br/><br/>He did return this year and won his second Munster title with the county, after helping the Treaty County claim the league crown in the spring. <br/><br/>But his announcement brings to an end 11 years service. He made his senior inter-county debut in the 2009 replay defeat by Waterford. <br/><br/>“I leave with nothing but wonderful memories and pride from my 11 years playing with Limerick,” said Browne. <br/><br/>“To have shared the dressing room with all my past team-mates and this incredible panel of players now has been the greatest honour of my life. <br/><br/>“I look forward to supporting the 2020 panel and management and I would urge all Limerick supporters to do so. There are fantastic times ahead. <br/><br/>"I would like to thank my club Bruff GAA, fellow club colleagues, coaches and mentors for their support. I hope to repay that support over the coming years. <br/><br/>"I would like to thank my employers LIT who have been very accommodating since I commenced my employment there".</p>
