      <p>It is a measure of Southampton’s difficulties just now that some crumbs of optimism can be taken from the prospect of a fixture at Arsenal. You have to go way back to 1987 for their last league victory there and yet the statistic that looms largest over the season is the concession of 21 goals during five defeats and one drawn game at St Mary’s. The one related positive for a club with comfortably the worst home record in the Premier League has been the contrast with performances on their travels.</p>
      <p>Southampton have taken more points away from home than Manchester United, Arsenal or Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p>Southampton have also sold an away allocation of 3,000 tickets for <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/arsenal-vs-southampton-premier-league-time-kick-off-tv-channel/">Saturday's match</a> and, having taken the unusual midseason decision to schedule a friendly with Brentford during the international break, manager Ralph Hasenhüttl has been focused on improving his team out of possession during the past fortnight. “It was a good test for us – back to basics and fundamentals – and it was good for the players,” said Hasenhüttl. “It’s a fact that our behaviour after losing the ball is not always the best and the less confidence you have the more you get disappointed when you lose a ball.</p>
      <p>“The normal reaction should be to not think about the mistakes and immediately try to hunt and get the ball back. When you think about mistakes then this moment is gone. Don’t stop working or trying to win the ball back immediately. This was the topic for the last two weeks – to find this trigger back. We forgot a little bit about this behaviour which made us strong.”</p>
      <p>Hasenhüttl's own standing is another stark reminder of how quickly football can change. He was on the long list of candidates for the Arsenal manager’s job when Arsene Wenger departed last year and, even during the summer, there were those at St Mary’s who wondered if unrest around Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham could see history repeat itself. He certainly would not have been the first Southampton manager or player to attract interest from Tottenham.</p>
      <p>As it is, Hasenhüttl's focus is on solidifying his position at Southampton and transforming a season that is already again threatened by a long relegation battle. The return from suspension of left-back Ryan Bertrand should help ahead of a series of five consecutive fixtures against other struggling teams before Christmas. “I have a whole squad available,” said Hasenhüttl. “The goal we have now is to find a team, a squad, an 11 that wins a game. It’s time to find a squad we can trust.”</p>
