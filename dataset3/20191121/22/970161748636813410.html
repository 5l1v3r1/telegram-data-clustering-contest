      <p>Al Pacino rallies a group of vigilante Nazi killers into action in the violent trailer for Jordan Peele’s new show Hunters.</p>
      <p>The series is set in 70s New York and a group of young people are recruited to track down and dispatch high-ranking Nazi officials who are living among the people.</p>
      <p>The Nazis are planning a Fourth Reich in America, and it’s up to the Hunters to bring them to bloody justice.</p>
      <p>The trailer is accompanied by a speech from Pacino’s character, who says: ‘There comes a time where we all must choose between the light and the darkness. But when there’s great darkness in this world, perhaps a choice is made for us.</p>
      <p>‘For eons, people like us have been degraded and exterminated, but no more. There is evil among us and you must remember, this evil starts with but a spot inside of them. Then it grows to a stain. Then it becomes a scourge. And we can’t know such evil until it strikes.</p>

      <p>‘So the time to act is now before everything we hold dear to us is destroyed. This is not murder. This is mitzvah. Welcome to the hunt.’</p>
