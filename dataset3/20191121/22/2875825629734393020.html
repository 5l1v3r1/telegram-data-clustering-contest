      <h2>Bruce signed Scotland international McGinn for a bargain £2million last year when Villa boss and believes he is among his best ever bargains</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/john-mcginn">John McGinn</a> has been told he’s <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> quality – by the boss who signed him for a bargain £2million.</p>
      <p>The Aston Villa midfielder is a red-hot £50million-rated property and is being monitored by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>But former Villa manager Steve Bruce has revealed how he lured McGinn to the Midlands from Hibernian for a knock-down price thanks to some persuasive rounds of golf at the former Ryder Cup venue The Belfry.</p>
      <p>Bruce, who takes his <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> side to Villa on Monday night, said: “We nearly didn’t sign him because we couldn’t afford £2m, but we whipped him away from Celtic just at the right time.</p>
      <p>"I always knew he’d be very good, but he’s surpassed expectations.</p>

      <p>“How we kept him away from Celtic I don’t know because his grandfather was the chairman!</p>
      <p>“It took a couple of games of golf at the Belfry with his dad until we could muster the money together. I am delighted for the kid because he is smashing lad.”</p>
      <p>Bruce rates McGinn as one of his best cut price signings; high praise indeed given his landed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> ’s £80m defender Harry Maguire for £2.5m and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> full-back Andy Robertson for not much more while at Hull.</p>
      <p>“I wish I could find a few more of him,” admitted Bruce of McGinn. “He has to be one of my best ever signings because he has a determination to do well.</p>
      <p>“It took him a minute to win over the supporters at Villa when I was manager because he crashed into a tackle, sprayed a 50-yard pass and had a shot in his first few minutes.”</p>

      <p>McGinn continued to catch the eye during Villa’s promotion campaign and has shone on their return to the top flight.</p>
      <p>Villa say it would take an eye-watering sum to lure him away mid-season.</p>
      <p>But Bruce has no doubt McGinn has what it takes to play for a side challenging for a top-six spot.</p>
      <p>Bruce added: “Man Utd? From what he has done in 12 months, he can only improve. He is that level, yeah.</p>
      <p>"He scored twice again for Scotland the other night, so that’s six in three games for them.”</p>
