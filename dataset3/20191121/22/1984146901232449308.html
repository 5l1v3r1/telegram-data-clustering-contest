      <p>Aston Villa's John McGinn has been linked with a January move to Manchester United after finding life in the Premier League as easy as he did in the Championship.</p>
      <p>The Scottish international will be one of the Villian's key men as Newcastle United travel down to Villa Park on Monday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> head coach Steve Bruce knows the talents of McGinn - and so he should considering he was the man who brought to the Midlands from Hibernian in July 2018.</p>
      <p>Just three months later <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> was sacked by Villa but still considers McGinn as one his best signings - and believes he can certainly play for a top side.</p>

      <p>"Yes, from what he has done in 12 months," Bruce replied when asked about McGinn playing for a side like Manchester United.</p>
      <p>"He can only improve.</p>
      <p>"He is at that level."</p>
      <p>McGinn signed at a time when Villa's finances were poor, and the club having lost in the play-off final to Fulham were making cuts just to survive.</p>
      <p>Bruce, who was heavily involved in trying to keep the club afloat, admits that things became so bad that McGinn nearly didn't complete his move.</p>
      <p>“A club like Villa we didn’t have £2m, in the end we got him.</p>
      <p>"How we got him out of Celtic I don’t know because his grandfather was the chairman.</p>
      <p>"It took a couple of games of golf at the Belfry with his dad until we could muster the money together. I am delighted for the kid because he is a smashing lad.</p>
      <p>"It took him a minute to win over the supporters because he crashed into a tackle and sprayed a 50 yard pass, and have a shot in first few minutes.</p>
      <p>"He has to be one of my best ever signings because he has a determination to do well. Him and Grealish in the middle, Grealish is a top, top player."</p>
