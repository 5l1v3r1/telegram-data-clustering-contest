      <p>Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa will inaugurate the Kalaburagi airport in Kalaburagi on Friday afternoon. Preparations for the inaugural function are in full swing on the airport premises located near Srinivas Saradagi.</p>
      <p>During his first stint as chief minister, Yediyurappa had laid the foundation stone for building the airport on June 14, 2018. A total of 567 acres of farmland was acquired for the project.</p>
      <p>It was earlier decided to be built on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model and the state government had entered into an agreement with Maytas Infra for 30 years. However, the agreement was cancelled in 2015 due to various reasons. </p>
      <p>The public works department took up the construction work in 2016 with technical guidance from RITES India and completed the task at a cost of Rs 175 crore.</p>
      <p>Trial runs were held on August 26, 2018.</p>
      <p>The 3.25-km runway is said to be the second-longest runway in the state after the runway at the Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru. </p>
      <p>For the first time in his political career spanning about 45 years, the name of veteran Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge is missing from the invitation card of an important function. </p>
      <p>He had made a lot efforts for the completion of the airport by getting funds released by the state government.</p>
      <p>“As he is not an elected representative now, his name has not been printed in the invitation card, as the protocol has to be followed”, said district administration sources. </p>
      <p>Commercial operation of flights will begin from the Kalaburagi airport on Friday. Star Air will operate commercial flights three days a week, Monday, Friday and Sunday, to Bengaluru.</p>
      <p>The airport has four ticket counters, passengers’ waiting lounge, a feeding room for lactating mothers, luggage claim lounge, drinking water, automated luggage detector, separate security check for men and women passengers among others. Alliance Air will also begin operations soon.</p>
      <p>Parking facility for three aircraft - two ATR-72 model flights (small flights with 50 to 72 seats) and A-320 model airbus (180 to 220 seats) has been made.</p>
      <p>Kalaburagi Airport director Jnaneshwara Rao said it has been decided not to land flights at night now as it requires special equipment. </p>
