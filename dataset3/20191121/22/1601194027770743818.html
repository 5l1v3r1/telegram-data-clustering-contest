      <p>Antonio Brown has filed his initial response to accusations of sexual assault and rape made against him in a civil lawsuit by his former personal trainer Britney Taylor.</p>
      <p>Brown, who was released by the New England Patriots in September, has always firmly denied the allegations.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has now officially filed his response and counterclaims in Broward County Circuit Court, Florida.</p>
      <p>A statement issued to Omnisport by Brown's lawyer Camille E. Blanton read: "In his pleading, Mr. Brown categorically denies each and every allegation contained in the Taylor complaint.</p>
      <p>"Additionally, Mr. Brown provided numerous significant facts that were omitted from Taylor's complaint, including Taylor's communications to Brown revealing that Taylor was open to a romantic relationship with Brown, Taylor's travel from Memphis to South Florida 12 days after the alleged 2018 sexual assault, Taylor's arrival at Mr. Brown's residence at 2:42am on the morning of her 2018 return South Florida trip, Taylor's continued communications with Brown after the alleged rape, including a copious amount of text message (SMS) exchanges with Mr. Brown in the hours after Taylor's engagement on May 28, 2018.</p>
      <p>"Mr. Brown is committed to his continued aggressive response to Taylor's false allegations.</p>
      <p>"Not only does Mr. Brown seek to clear his name, but he also desires to make a statement that there is not an open season to extort professional athletes."</p>
      <p>Since leaving the Patriots, former Pittsburgh Steelers and Oakland Raiders wide receiver Brown has claimed he has quit the NFL on several occasions, though he has subsequently refuted those comments.</p>
