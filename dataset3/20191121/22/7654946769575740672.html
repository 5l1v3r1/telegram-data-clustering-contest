      <h1>Texans vs. Colts prediction, line: Houston the pick</h1>

      <p>Dating back to last season, the Houston Texans have been one of the top teams in the NFL, going 17-7 straight up in their last 24 games. Despite having turnover at the running back position with the Lamar Miller injury affecting the team’s initial plans, the team ranks fifth in the league in rushing yards per game this season.</p>
      <p>The Texans should have a massive advantage on the ground on Thursday night with the Indianapolis Colts heading to Houston without their top running back, Marlon Mack.</p>
      <p>Deshaun Watson also should have better protection this week after being sacked six times by the Baltimore Ravens. The Colts rank 19th in the NFL in percentage of opponents’ passes in which they generate a sack. That should lend security to laying the points with the Texans.</p>
      <p><b>The play:</b> Texans, -4.</p>
