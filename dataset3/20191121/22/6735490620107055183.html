      <p>“There is some truth in this story. It has been pumped up a bit more than it deserves,” Norton recently told “The Jonathan Ross Show”, per <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7711035/Edward-Norton-relives-moment-SAVED-Leonardo-DiCaprio-drowning.html"><i>DailyMail</i></a>. “We were in the Galapagos Islands… We were scuba diving with Sylvia Earl, the great Oceanographer.”</p>
      <p>‘I’ve known Leo a long time and he loses his mind around animals, he really has a childlike passion for them,” the actor explained. “This flight of 100 spotted eagle rays went by below us and I saw the look on his face, I saw him charging off with this camera that he had.”</p>

      <p>“I have been diving since I was 16-years-old, I reflectively looked at my watch and was like, “We’re very close to the end,'” Norton recalled. “I saw him going off and down and I knew that wasn’t a good thing so I followed him because I thought to myself, he’s chasing these things, he’s going to run out of air — and he did.”</p>
      <p>“Before the Flood” went on to receive positive reviews and featured subjects like Barack Obama, Pope Francis and Elon Musk.</p>
      <p>The full episode airs this Saturday.</p>
