      <p>The new quarry entrance is located at Augusta Ave. in South Knoxville. Improvements to the area include this new entrance with signage, a paved parking lot, distinct walking trails leading to the swimming area and other landscaping additions to spruce up the area.</p>
      <p>"There's hiking and mountain biking trails here, there's picnic areas and swimming and it's just a beautiful natural place to enjoy," said Urban Wilderness Coordinator Rebekah-Jane Montgomery. "When spaces are more accessible and feel safer, then more people use those spaces. It automatically becomes a place where people want to be."</p>
      <p>The $1.7 million project is just in the first phase, with a goal to make the area more accessible to the public. According to the design team, the main goals of the updates were to create a more family-friendly environment and a more appealing area while making the quarry feel like more of a real park.</p>
      <p>The ribbon-cutting ceremony was held beside the Augusta Quarry at 3:30 pm on Thursday, November 21.</p>
