      <h1>Android Security Rewards expanded for bug reports</h1>

      <p>A few years ago Google introduced their Android Security Rewards program. It is essentially a way for those inclined that way to report any bugs they find that can lead to a security issue associated with the Android OS and get paid for it.</p>
      <p>For the users who’ve got the capacity to find the right bugs, there have been over 4 million US dollars paid out via the program since 2015. That has the potential to skyrocket with some <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2019/11/expanding-android-security-rewards.html%E2%80%9D">increased payout offerings</a> from the team at Google:</p>
      <blockquote>We are introducing a top prize of $1 million for a full chain remote code execution exploit with persistence which compromises the Titan M secure element on Pixel devices. Additionally, we will be launching a specific program offering a 50% bonus for exploits found on specific developer preview versions of Android, meaning our top prize is now $1.5 million.</blockquote>
      <p>It’s not just deep-diving in code that has the potential to bring reward though, even finding a way to bypass the lockscreen could bring you some reward as this (clearly) has the potential to compromise the security of a significant number of devices.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot of people, a <b>lot</b> smarter than me involved in these sorts of programs and the top payout so far in 2019 has been $201,337.00 for identifying a remote code exploit. This report also resulted in change to <a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2019/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop.html%E2%80%9D">Chrome Desktop</a>.</p>
      <p>Personally I feel comforted by the transparency of this process and the call for parties external to Google being involved in the research.</p>
