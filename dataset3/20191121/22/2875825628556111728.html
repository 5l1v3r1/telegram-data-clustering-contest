      <p>Victoria Beckham was pictured hanging out with Kim and Kourtney Kardashian, appearing in a photo which screamed fashion (and money).</p>
      <p>The Kardashian sisters posed alongside Victoria, who has just rreleased a new moisturiser from her beauty brand.</p>
      <p>In a photo posted on Vicks' <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> , the trio are standing at the bottom of a grand staircase.</p>
      <p>Victoria is in a chic white pant suit while Kim sports a black velvet bardot dress and Kourtney wears a black leather trench coat.</p>
      <p>In the caption, VB wrote that she had "so much fun" with the famous reality TV sisters at the launch.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Victoria released her make up collection, which featured compact eyeshadow palletes, single eyeshadows, and eyeliners.</p>

      <p>And now fans can get their hands on the Cell Rejuvenating Priming Moisturiser, which VB claims will "help support cell turnover and improve radiance, plump and tone skin, and minimize he appearance of pores and imperfections".</p>
      <p>Kourtney posted her own photo of her outfit from the night, alongside a cryptic quote.</p>

      <p>She also posted a quote on her story about forgiveness, perhaps alluding to her relationship with her ex and the father of her children, Scott Disick, or her step parent Caitlyn Jenner, who she has notably not publicly supported on I'm a Celebrity.</p>
      <p>"Forgiveness is taking the knife out of your own back and not using it to hurt anyone else no matter how they hurt you", it said.</p>
      <p>Today in the jungle, Caitlyn opened up to her I'm A Celebrity campmates over what her kids now call her.</p>

      <p>The reality TV star, 70, who came out publicly as a trans woman in April 2015, also explained how she refers to Bruce.</p>
      <p>During the intimate jungle chat down by the creek about her famous family, Caitlyn explained that her kids still call her 'Dad'.</p>
      <p>During a chat with Kate Garraway, Jacqueline Jossa, Nadine Coyle and Adele Roberts, Caitlyn said: "My kids all call me Dad, Kendall asked me first and I said ‘Dad’, I’m your Dad and I’ll always be your Dad till the day I die.</p>
      <p>"But what they’re really good at which shocks me all the time is when they’re talking about me, my Dad she and it’s tough to change the pronoun in the middle of it."</p>
