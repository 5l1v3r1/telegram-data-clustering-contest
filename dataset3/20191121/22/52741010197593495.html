      <p>TORONTO — A protest outside a Toronto university event featuring former Israeli soldiers that escalated into physical violence prompted a broader discussion Thursday on how such hot-button issues as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are addressed on campus.</p>
      <p>The Wednesday night event was organized by the Herut Zionism Club and featured former members of the Israel Defense Forces speaking about "the Arab-Israeli conflict, BDS and much more," according to a promotional poster. BDS refers to the movement to "boycott, divest and sanction" Israel that has long been a hot-button issue on Canadian campuses.</p>
      <p>Protesters and counter-protesters from on- and off-campus showed up, York President Rhonda Lenton said in a written statement Thursday.</p>
      <p>"The fact that external groups were on campus last night for the sole purpose of fomenting conflict should be especially disturbing to everyone at York," Lenton said.</p>
      <p>Lenton said the university is reviewing the events to determine whether there was hate speech, harassment, threats or discrimination — all of which go against the school's free speech policy.</p>
      <p>"Shouting, threats of violence and attempts to intimidate community members are not consistent with the responsibilities we all share," she said.</p>
      <p>Lenton did not specify which groups were involved or what side they were on, and a spokesperson for the school did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.</p>
      <p>Toronto police Const. Allyson Douglas-Cook said officers removed several people from the protest, which she characterized as very loud but "mostly peaceful."</p>
      <p>She said one person was injured in the ruckus, and nobody was arrested.</p>
      <p>Organizers of the initial protest, Students Against Israeli Apartheid, said they demonstrated peacefully — if loudly — and made sure ahead of time that their chants were specifically against the IDF and not the broader Jewish community.</p>
      <p>"They were coming in a somewhat official capacity to represent the IDF, and the IDF is known to be a force, a group of soldiers, that have actually committed a lot of human rights violations," said Huda Sadoon, a fourth-year student.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the UN found the force had violated international human rights by firing live rounds into a crowd of protesters on the Gaza strip in 2018.</p>
      <p>Videos posted online of Wednesday's event shows a large crowd filling a campus hallway, chanting, "Viva, viva intefadeh!" referring to a Palestinian uprising that began in 1987 and lasted several years.</p>
      <p>Another video appears to show a group of people fighting in a stairwell before being broken up by police.</p>
      <p>The clash prompted Premier Doug Ford to weigh in, condemning the pro-Palestinian protesters.</p>
      <p>"I am disappointed that York University allowed for a hate-filled protest to take place last night," Ford tweeted. "I stand with the Jewish students and the Jewish community. There is no place in Ontario for racism and hatred."  </p>
      <p>The school said it will establish a strategy to foster a "more productive dialogue" around the thorny Israeli-Palestinian issue.</p>
      <p>"In democratic societies, universities play a central role in facilitating debate on difficult issues," said Lenton.</p>
