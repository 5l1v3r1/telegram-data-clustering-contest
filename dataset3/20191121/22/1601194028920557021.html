      <p>With <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/nxt">WWE NXT</a> beating <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/all-elite-wrestling">AEW</a> Dynamite in the 'Wednesday Night Wars' on the measurement of television ratings for the first time, a few feathers have certainly been ruffled - and one man who's spoken out is current AEW World Champion Chris Jericho.</p>
      <p>This week, NXT <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-nxt-surpasses-aew-dynamite-on-tv-ratings-in-this-week-s-wednesday-night-wars">hit a whopping 916,000</a> viewers on the go-home show for NXT TakeOver: WarGames and WWE Survivor Series, while AEW finished up just 23,000 viewers below on 893,000.</p>
      <p>NXT's increase was substantial, having only reached 750,000 the week before, while AEW was very slightly down on last week. Chris Jericho, though spoke out saying it was a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

      <p>Of course, several fans responded to Jericho, with the current AEW Champion responding to one Twitter user who cited Jericho's recent comments about <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/aew-news-chris-jericho-says-nxt-is-a-minor-league-of-basically-unknown-performers">NXT being the "minor leagues"</a> - and the former WWE Superstar responded, hinting that last night wasn't a "true NXT show" because a plethora of stars from RAW and SmackDown appearared on the show in the run-up to Survivor Series where all three WWE rosters will be competing for brand supremacy.</p>
