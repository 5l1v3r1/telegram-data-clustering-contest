      <p>PARIS: The French government has quietly abandoned a campaign urging people to refrain from drinking alcohol in January, after winemakers pushed President Emmanuel Macron to drop a plan they say promotes "total abstinence".</p>
      <p>Health Minister Agnes Buzyn admitted Thursday (Nov 21) that no discussion of a Dry January, initially set for 2020, would be held until a ministerial health prevention committee meeting in February.</p>

      <p>"The campaign is being developed," Buzyn told Franceinfo radio, adding that she would have to sign off on a Dry January, "but that's not necessarily the format we'll decide on."</p>
      <p>Anti-addiction campaigners denounced the U-turn, which they blamed on intense lobbying from the ANEV group of lawmakers from France's numerous wine-growing regions.</p>
      <p>France has the third-highest per capita consumption of alcohol among the 36 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, according to a report from the club of wealthy nations this month.</p>
      <p>Alcohol results in 41,000 deaths in France each year, according to France's Public Health Agency, which urges people to limit themselves to two glasses a day - "and not every day."</p>
      <p>But Macron - who once proclaimed "I drink wine at lunch and dinner!" - reportedly told winemakers in the Champagne region earlier this month that they had nothing to worry about.</p>
      <p>"He told us, 'You can let people know there won't be any Dry January'," Maxime Toubart, president of the Champagne growers' association, told the Vitisphere industry website.</p>
      <p>Asked about the comment on Wednesday, the Elysee Palace refused to confirm or deny the report.</p>
      <p>The plan took its inspiration from the Dry January launched by the British association Alcohol Change in 2013, which has proven increasingly popular as people take a break from imbibing after the holiday festivities.</p>
      <p>The French health ministry already sponsors a smoke-free November to raise awareness over the risks of tobacco.</p>
      <p>"There were backroom decisions taken that raise questions, even though the budgets were set and people were already at work" on the campaign, said Nathalie Latour of the Addiction Federation.</p>
      <p>"These campaigns work: they set a challenge and let people talk about alcohol in a different way, without stigmatising it, and contribute to more controlled use for several months afterwards," she said.</p>
      <p>France's agriculture minister had already unleashed a torrent of criticism from addiction experts last January after he claimed that wine, unlike other forms of alcohol, was rarely the cause of binge drinking.</p>
