      <p>Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle taught some of her jungle camp mates the dance to one of the group's most famous hits with hilarious conequences.</p>
      <p>Eat your heart out Cheryl, Nicola, Sarah and Kimberley as there is now a Jungle Girls Aloud comprising of Nadine, alongside Adele Roberts, Jacqueline Jossa and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn Jenner.</a></p>
      <p>Big Girls Aloud fan was singing the chorus of number 1 single The Promise to Adele when Nadine overheard them and rallied them and Caitlyn to learn some of the moves to its chorus <i><b>as you can see in the video above taken from ITV.</b></i></p>
      <p>Talking in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity's</a> Bush Telegraph, Nadine said “I taught the girls a little bit of The Promise routine, Jacqueline and Adele knew most of it already.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn enjoyed dancing to The Promise as Nadine sang the lyrics.</p>
      <p>In the BT, Jacqueline said “I just love Caitlyn Jenner, she just throws herself into everything, she doesn’t even know the songs.”</p>
      <p>All the camp cheered as the girls finished the dance routine, Nadine joked “We’re ready for the stage, send us in.”</p>
      <p>In the BT, an over excited Adele said “I’ve just danced to The Promise with Nadine Coyle, Caitlyn Jenner and Jacqueline Jossa!.”</p>
      <p>  Nadine said in the BT, “Caitlyn just threw herself into it, we’ll teach her Sound of the Underground next.”</p>
      <p>And viewers absolutely loved what they saw. One joked "caitlyn jenner to replace cheryl cole in girls aloud when they reform, you heard it here first," and another reacted "Caitlyn doing that Girls Aloud dance routine is probably the most random yet funniest thing I have ever witnessed. Seriously I’m sitting here like what is actually happening right now."</p>
