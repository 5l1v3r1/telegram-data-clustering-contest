      <p>During his appeal hearing with the NFL on Wednesday, Browns defensive end Myles Garrett claimed Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph called him a racial slur right before a <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/steelers-browns-live-score-updates-highlights-thursday-night-football/r6xyx2seq57j1h7obct9hqik3">fight broke out</a> between Cleveland and Pittsburgh at the end of their "Thursday Night Football" game on Nov. 14, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28130757/during-appeal-myles-garrett-accused-mason-rudolph-using-racial-slur">ESPN's Adam Schefter and Josina Anderson</a>.</p>
      <p>An NFL spokersperson said the league looked into Garrett's allegation but "found no such evidence" Rudolph uttered a racial slur,<a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1197623527878406144">per Schefter</a>.</p>
      <p>Garrett, however, indicated Thursday night on Twitter that Rudolph did say something objectionable.</p>

      <p>Rudolph earlier Thursday denied Garrett's allegation through a Steelers spokesperson, who said Rudolph "will not discuss this accusation any further" and added "his focus remains on preparation for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals."</p>
      <p>Rudolph <a href="http://twitter.com/Jacob_Klinger_/status/1197590127784144896">was not available</a> tospeak to reporters following the team's Thursday afternoon practice, but hisattorney, Timothy M. Younger, shared a statement on his behalf.</p>

      <p>"According to ESPN, in his appeal, Myles Garrett falsely asserted that Mason Rudolph uttered a racial slur toward him, prior to swinging a helmet at Mason's uncovered head, in a desperate attempt to mitigate his suspension," <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/1197582583531540480">Younger said</a>. "This is a lie. This false allegation was never asserted by Garrett in the aftermath of the game, never suggested prior to the hearing, and conspicuously absent in the apology published by the Browns and adopted by Garrett.</p>
      <p>"The malicious use of this wild and unfounded allegation is an assault on Mason's integrity which is far worse than the physical assault witnessed on Thursday. This is reckless and shameful. We will have no further comment."</p>
      <p>Browns coach Freddie Kitchens affirmed his support for Garrett when asked about the ESPN report on Thursday, but Kitchens would not say whether Garrett made him aware of the accusation.</p>

      <p>During Wednesday's media session, Rudolph accepted responsibility for not keeping his composure but made it clear he "<a href="https://twitter.com/NoahStrack/status/1197184434493173761">definitely didn't say anything</a>"to anger Garrett to the point that he would rip off Rudolph's helmet and use it as a weapon against Rudolph.</p>

      <p>When asked immediately following the game if Rudolph had said something to upset him, Garrett paused before saying, "They've just got to go look at it."</p>

Rudolph avoided a suspension but was reportedly expected to <a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1195409049233158144">receive a fine</a> for his role in the fight.</p>
