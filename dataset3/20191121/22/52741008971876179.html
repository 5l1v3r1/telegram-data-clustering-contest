      <p>TORONTO — North American stock markets fell slightly as investors continued to await signals about a trade deal and the strength of consumer spending.</p>
      <p>Markets partially recovered at the end of Thursday trading on reports that more meetings are planned between the U.S. and China in a bid to conclude a partial trade deal before the Dec. 15 deadline when tariffs will be added on US$156 billion of Chinese-made goods. The tariffs would raise the price of consumer items including electronics.</p>
      <p>"If there's a worry in the marketplace that is it," said Catharine Sterritt, Associate Portfolio Manager, Equities for CIBC Asset Management.</p>
      <p>Investors have turned cautious after markets surged to record highs amid reports that the world's two largest economies may fail to reach an agreement this year.</p>
      <p>And former White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn doused some hopes by recently saying he expects U.S. President Donald Trump will impose the tariffs if no deal is reached because he'd lose credibility with China if he doesn't.</p>
      <p>The markets have been relatively flat all week awaiting positive signals on trade, said Sterritt.</p>
      <p>"You're not seeing the jarring you're going to have in the market if those tariffs come in," she said in an interview, adding that tariffs will create "sticker shock for consumers."</p>
      <p>Sterritt said there's been a rotation out of defensive sectors that have done well to beaten up ones on increasing optimism of a detente in trade tensions.</p>
      <p>She said there's been a pause ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday next week that marks the start to the important shopping season with Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>"So there's kind of this pausing as we're waiting to get that follow through and see whether or not we do indeed get the strong consumer purchasing that is anticipated, especially with continued low interest rates," she said.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P/TSX composite index closed down for a fourth-straight day, shedding 6.63 points at 16,999.19 after hitting an intraday low of 16,950.79.</p>
      <p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 54.80 points at 27,766.29. The S&amp;P 500 index was down 4.92 points at 3,103.54, while the Nasdaq composite was down 20.52 points at 8,506.21.</p>
      <p>The Canadian dollar traded for 75.27 cents US compared with an average of 75.17 cents US on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The health care sector surged 6.7 per cent on a broad rally by cannabis producers which have seen their share prices decimated on weak quarterly results.</p>
      <p>Hexo Corp. led with its shares gaining 34 per cent, followed by the Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Ltd. at 31.5 per cent, Aurora Cannabis Inc. 18.3 per cent and Canopy Growth Corp. 15.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>Energy also climbed with 72 per cent of the sector's companies trading higher on increased crude oil prices after being "beaten up in Canada," said Sterritt.</p>
      <p>The January crude contract was up US$1.57 at US$58.58 per barrel and the January natural gas contract was up 1.1 cent at US$2.62 per mmBTU.</p>
      <p>Materials was down 1.4 per cent with about 85 per cent of sector companies losing ground on a dip in gold prices. Eldorado Gold was off 4.9 per cent while Barrick Gold Corp. shares were down 2.4 per cent.</p>
      <p>The December gold contract was down US$10.60 at US$1,463.60 an ounce and the December copper contract was down 2.6 cents at US$2.62 a pound.</p>
