      <h1>Paedophile teacher abused six young girls at primary school</h1>
      <h2>Charles Ellis was given training about how not to touch children inappropriately but the abuse continued</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:21:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/jenny-kirkham/" target="_blank">Jenny Kirkham</a></address>
      <p>A paedophile teacher used his job at a primary school to sexually abuse six girls aged eight and nine.</p>
      <p>And when one victim of Charles Ellis came forward to police in 2013, no prosecution was brought against him.</p>
      <p>Instead he was given training about how to not touch children inappropriately at the Wirral school where he worked.</p>
      <p>But his sickening abuse carried on for another three years.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old of Oakfield Drive, Upton, in Chester, was  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crime">convicted of ten offences against six girls</a> .</p>

        <figcaption>Charles Ellis, 60, of Oakfield Drive, Upton in Chester, was convicted of ten offences of sexually assaulting six girls, who were just eight and nine-years-old at the time.</figcaption>

      <p>The victims were just eight and nine years old at the time.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/courts">Liverpool Crown Court</a>  heard how Ellis would put his hand on the girls' backs under their clothes, touch their bottoms under and over their clothes and touch their legs.</p>
      <p>Charlotte Kenny, prosecuting, told how Ellis had been employed at the school, which the  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> has chosen not to name, since 2002.</p>
      <p>The offences spanned over eight years.</p>
      <p>Ms Kenny claimed that Ellis was “motivated by sexual gratification” and “abused his position of trust” before more victims and a member of staff came forward to complain.</p>
      <p>After his behaviour was reported by one of the victims, the police again became involved and revisited the earlier report about his behaviour.</p>
      <p>A member of staff had also twice reported feeling uncomfortable about his touching some of the girl pupils.</p>
      <p>He was suspended by the school in April 2017.</p>
      <p>Miss Kenny told the jury that Ellis, who has no previous convictions, was “a man who appears not to be able to control himself.”</p>
      <p>Judge Thomas Teague, QC, released Ellis on bail to enable a pre-sentence report to be prepared but warned him that he was likely to receive a custodial sentence when he returns on December 19.</p>
