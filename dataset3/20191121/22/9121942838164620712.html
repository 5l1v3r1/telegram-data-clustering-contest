      <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — Career nights from Desure Buie and Jalen Ray helped propel Hofstra to one of its biggest wins in school history.</p>
      <p>Buie scored 29 points and Ray added 27 as the Pride rallied in the second half for an 88-78 victory over UCLA on Thursday night at Pauley Pavilion.</p>
      <p>“Those two guys weren’t going to let us lose,” coach Joe Mihalich said. “It’s almost hard to put this win into words. We’re almost numb with excitement.”</p>
      <p>Eli Pemberton added 15 for the Pride (3-2), who made 12 3-pointers along with going 24 of 30 on free throws. Ray made five from beyond the arc and Buie did not miss in 13 trips to the line.</p>
      <p>Hofstra trailed 59-51 with 13:50 remaining before scoring eight straight points, including a pair of Ray 3-pointers. The Pride led 69-68 before taking control with a 13-4 run to go up 82-72 with 2:49 left. Ray had five points during the spurt and Buie added three.</p>
      <p>“We were able to feed off each other,” Ray said. “We got some momentum at the end of the first half and were able to carry it into the second.”</p>

      <p>The Bruins have lost three times to mid-major programs at Pauley the past two seasons, but Hofstra was poised to pull off the upset. The Pride — who reached the NIT last season — are the preseason favorite to win the Colonial Athletic Conference and have three senior starters.</p>
      <p>“We got exposed,” Cronin said. “We have young, inexperienced players. We got beat off the dribble seemingly every possession.”</p>
      <p>Jalen Hill scored a career-high 24 points and grabbed 12 rebounds for UCLA (4-1), which suffered its first loss under Cronin. It is Hill’s second double-double of the season and fifth of his career. Cody Riley added 12 points before fouling out with 8:22 remaining.</p>
      <p>Hill said he could feel the tide turning in the second half and was unable to stop it.</p>
      <p>“From last year I saw it a lot and knew what was happening. It was tough seeing it unfold. We had a lot of unforced turnovers tonight,” he said.</p>
      <p>UCLA led by as many as 13 in the first half before Hofstra went on a 22-10 rally over the final eight minutes to get within 42-41 at halftime. Ray scored eight points and Blue added seven during that stretch.</p>

      <p>The Bruins made 12 of their first 17 from the field to start the game but hit 4 of 15 the rest of the first half. They were 29 of 61 (47.5%) for the game but 6 of 22 from 3-point range — including 1 of 10 in the second half.</p>
      <p>THE TAKEAWAY</p>
      <p>Hofstra: This is the first time the Pride have defeated UCLA in three meetings. It is also their first win over a Power Five program since defeating Florida State in 2015.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had some great chances for big wins the last couple years but were not good enough. Tonight we were,” Mihalich said. “We got UCLA at a good time.”</p>
      <p>UCLA: Cronin knows he has a young team that will have plenty of growing pains, but the one thing that had him fuming was only nine deflections on defense. Cronin said that was a career low for him as a coach.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have enough fortitude and they tested it tonight because they had only seven turnovers. As a coaching staff we were concerned about a lot of things and we were exposed,” he said.</p>
