      <p>Julie Clark, one of the homeowners, told Viral Hog in a statement that the much-loved Christmas decoration was nabbed at around 1:56 a.m. local time on November 17, and that they’d only purchased the holiday item the year prior.</p>
      <p>“On Nov 17, I noticed that my snowman display was missing so I checked the garage, then called my husband. He said, he did nothing with him and that he must have been taken. I then checked our Ring doorbell camera footage and at 1:56 am there it was - a man grabbing frosty and running down the hill with him,” reads the statement. </p>
      <blockquote>“We go big with Christmas lights every year and even won the City of Moraine’s Christmas lights contest, for the past 5 [years]. This hurts,” she added.</blockquote>
      <p>The holiday robbery was reported to police, but no suspects have been identified or caught at present. The Clark family intends to find a replacement snowman for their stolen Frosty.</p>
