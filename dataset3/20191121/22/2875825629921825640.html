      <h1>Jose Mourinho tipped to win trophies that eluded Tottenham predecessor Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>The Mourinho era with Spurs begins on Saturday with a derby at West Ham's London Stadium - between two sides in desperate form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini believes Jose Mourinho can bring the trophies to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> that eluded Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>But the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> boss reckons any success is likely come at a cost, with Spurs fans predicted to be thinking about "what kind of football you want" sooner or later.</p>
      <p>The Mourinho era with Spurs begins at 12.30pm on Saturday with a London Stadium derby between two sides in desperate form.</p>
      <p>Tottenham jettisoned Pochettino on Tuesday night while the Hammers are sticking with Pellegrini - for now.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that Mourinho and Pellegrini view each other with contempt even though both are ex-Real Madrid managers who have won the Premier League as well.</p>

      <p>Mourinho taunted Pellegrini for joining mid-level Malaga on leaving Madrid, who sacked him in 2010 to make way for the Special One.</p>
      <p>Pellegrini, who insisted not being Mourinho's friend does not make him his enemy, prides himself on producing attacking teams that don't 'park the bus'.</p>
      <p>And he reckons there could soon be plenty of the latter at the new-look White Hart Lane.</p>
      <p>He said: "Jose Mourinho, in every league where he works, in Italy, in Spain, here in England, he is a manager that has a lot of titles behind him so he will be a manager who is good for football. After that you must think of what kind of football you want.</p>
      <p>"Of course the philosophy of Pochettino is not the same as the philosophy of Mourinho, but he's just in charge of the team in two days so I don't think he will try to change all properly."</p>

      <p>Pellegrini said he was surprised Pochettino was given the boot so soon after leading his team to the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>But something similar had happened to other big-name managers in the past - including Mourinho.</p>
      <p>He said: "You saw what happened with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> when Mourinho was manager. They won the title then the next season he was sacked. After that, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , exactly the same, (Claudio) Ranieri was sacked."</p>
      <p>Mourinho, in his last days as a TV pundit, had chided Vincent Kompany for not thanking him for helping City win the 2015 title under Pellegrini.</p>

      <p>That alluded to Chelsea's 2-0 win at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , City's only rivals for the prize, where Steven Gerrard famously slipped to allow Demba Ba to score.</p>
      <p>But Pellegrini wasn't willing to give Mourinho any credit whatsoever.</p>
      <p>He said: "Lots of people said we won that title because one player of Liverpool made a slip and conceded a goal.</p>
      <p>“Maybe I am wrong but I think we won that title by two points that season and Liverpool lost that game 2-0, not 1-0. If they had drawn without that goal we would still have won by one point.</p>
      <p>“Every team that beat Liverpool in that season, maybe it was good for us. Every team that beat <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> that season it was good for Liverpool. But you can’t be talking about one manager or one action during 38 games.”</p>
