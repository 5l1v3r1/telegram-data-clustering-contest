      <h1>MSU’s Tom Izzo quits coaches’ board after Joey Hauser’s waiver appeal denied</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:21:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p><b>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)</b> — Michigan State coach Tom Izzo abruptly resigned from a coaches’ board Thursday, angered after the NCAA denied an appeal from forward Joey Hauser to play this season.</p>
      <p>Izzo says the decision led to him resigning from the National Association of Basketball Coaches board of directors because he says the NCAA is making “arbitrary decisions” regarding waiver requests.</p>
      <p>Hauser transferred from Marquette in May and requested a waiver from the NCAA to be eligible immediately instead of sitting out the season, per usual transfer rules. The 6-foot-9 Hauser averaged nearly 10 points last season.</p>
      <p>The third-ranked Spartans play Virginia Tech next week in the Maui Invitational, where they will also face Dayton or Georgia and potentially No. 4 Kansas.</p>
