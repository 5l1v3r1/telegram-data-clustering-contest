      <h1>Hill on Ukraine Backing Clinton in 2016: 'They Bet on the Wrong Horse'</h1>
      <h2>Former National Security Council official Fiona Hill testified Thursday as part of the impeachment inquiry that some Ukrainian officials made “ill-advised” statements against then-candidate Donald Trump and backed Hillary Clinton in 2016, validating the president’s skepticism towards the country.</h2>

      <p>Rep. Jim Himes (D-CT) questioned Hill about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election, suggesting that it was a “fictional narrative.”</p>
      <p>“Dr. Hill…you characterized the idea that Ukraine interfered in the election as a fictional narrative. Have you seen any evidence at all that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election?” he said.</p>
      <p>Hill then produced two articles she was presented with during her closed-door deposition. One article was an <a href="https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/290411-ukraines-ambassador-trumps-comments-send-wrong-message-to">op-ed in The Hill</a> by then-Ukraine Ambassador to the U.S. Valeriy Chaly in August 2016, which was critical of then-candidate Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>Rep. Himes interrupted her, read from the op-ed and asked her rhetorically, “Does that sound like election interference to you?”</p>
      <p>She responded, “Well, I would say it’s probably not the most advisable thing to do for an ambassador because you never know who is going to win,” she said.</p>
      <p>The other article she brought up was a <i>Politico</i> piece by journalist Kenneth Vogel that outlined efforts by a Democratic National Committee contractor Alexandra Chalupa to work with Ukrainian officials to distribute dirt on the Trump campaign.</p>
      <p>“Kenneth Vogel is a very well-known, and as you pointed out, extremely good journalist,” she said. “I think it is extraordinarily important and gets to the issue here.”</p>
      <p>“Mr. Vogel points out that the Ukrainian government, again, they wouldn’t have done very well at the bookies…they bet on the wrong horse — they bet on Hillary Clinton winning the election. And so, you know, they were trying to curry favor with the Clinton campaign — it’s quite evident here,” she continued.</p>
      <p>Hill cited several Ukrainian officials in the article who were trying to collect information on Trump’s then-campaign manager Paul Manafort “and other people as well.”</p>

      <p>Hill added that “many officials from many countries including Ukraine” also “bet on the wrong horse.”</p>
      <p>“They believed that Secretary Clinton, former Sen. Clinton, former First Lady Clinton was going to win. Many said some pretty disparaging and hurtful things about him, and I can’t fault him for feeling aggrieved about them,” she added.</p>
      <p>She remembers collecting remarks that world leaders had made about candidate Trump after she joined the administration, in advance of head of state visits.</p>
      <p>“An awful lot of senior officials in many governments, including our allied government, said some pretty hurtful things about the president. And I would also personally take offense at some of the things that were said if I were the president.”</p>
