      <h1>Iowa Announces Honorary Captain For Game vs. Illinois</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:41:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>The 2019 Iowa Hawkeyes’ season is almost over, and Kinnick Stadium has seen some incredible performances and impressive wins. Ahead of the final home game of the season vs. Illinois, the Hawkeyes are inviting a special alumnus to serve as honorary captain.</p>
      <p>In a press release shared via <a href="https://247sports.com/college/iowa/Article/Los-Angeles-Chargers-Iowa-Hawkeyes-Football-Illinois-Fighting-Illini-Captain-Big-Ten-Conference-138958921/">Hawkeye Insider</a>, the school announced that former Hawkeye Desmond King will serve as honorary captain for the game. King currently plays for the Los Angeles Chargers after a standout career with the Hawkeyes.</p>
      <p>In four years at Iowa, King recorded 263 tackles, 33 passes defended, 14 interceptions and a forced fumble. He earned back-to-back First-Team All-Big Ten honors in his final two seasons. King also earned the Jim Thorpe Award and the Jack Tatum Award in 2015.</p>
      <p>As an NFL player he has thrived. Despite being a fifth-round pick in 2017, King earned his way onto the Chargers’ starting lineup and earned First-Team All-Pro honors last year.</p>

      <p>The Iowa Hawkeyes clinched a seventh consecutive winning season last week with their huge win over previously undefeated Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Having won three of their last four, Iowa can secure a nine-win regular season for the first time since 2015 if they win out.</p>
      <p>But can they get the job done against Illinois this weekend?</p>
