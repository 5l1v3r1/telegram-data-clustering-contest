      <h1>MoneyGram Expands In Hong Kong, New Zealand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:55:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>MoneyGram has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/moneygram-expands-digital-capabilities-in-asia-pacific-300963343.html">announced</a> that it’s continuing its worldwide digital expansion with greater options for its overseas customers, especially in the Asia Pacific area and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The MoneyGram website and MoneyGram Plus Rewards program is now available to the company’s Hong Kong customers, and users in New Zealand are now able to use the MoneyGram app to send money to friends and family. </p>
      <p>“Our Company is the middle of a transformation where we’re focused on accelerating digital growth,” said MoneyGram Chairman and CEO Alex Holmes. “With the expansion of our digital services to additional markets, we’re excited about reaching millions of new consumers with the simple and seamless experience of our online platforms.”</p>
      <p>The company is about three years into its focus on digital expansion, and it recently revealed that about 60 percent of all of its money transfer revenue comes from overseas markets. Also, about 20 percent of all transactions are now digital.</p>
      <p>The company said that users can now either send or get money digitally in more than 60 countries using MoneyGram.</p>
      <p>The MoneyGram app is going to be available next year in Hong Kong and a new website is coming to New Zealand in 2020. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2019/moneygram-wing-team-up-on-cambodian-digital-wallet/">Earlier this month</a>, MoneyGram announced a partnership with Cambodian bank Wing on a digital wallet venture that will allow funds to be deposited directly into customers’ accounts.</p>
      <p>“With 80 percent of our online transactions being made on a mobile device, we are looking to provide even more options for our customers using our digital platforms,” Holmes said. “Wing is at the forefront of mobile money and electronic payments, and this mobile wallet tool will serve as a valuable asset for the under-banked in Cambodia, allowing consumers to conveniently and reliably send money across digital boundaries from anywhere.”</p>
      <p>Customers will be able to receive and send money easily through the Wing Money app, and they’ll be able to get cash out of the more than 7,000 WING cash Xpress locations throughout the whole country. </p>
