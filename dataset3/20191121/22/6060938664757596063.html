      <p>Reuters reported HSBC stating that it fully supported the commission’s inquiry, while Standard Chartered said there was no evidence linking it to the Guptas directly.

The transactions were carried out in a professional and transparent manner and we are totally committed to comply with rules and regulations laid out by the governing bodies and regulators,” the bank said in a statement.</p>
      <p>It also added that the bank’s senior management has taken cognisance of the issues reported in the media. “We would also like to state that the business dealings and transactions undertaken by the South African territory have been extensively examined by the regulator through external agencies and the reports thereon have been submitted to the regulators. The bank also continues to fully cooperate with the law enforcement agencies and courts and have been providing full details as and when sought,” the lender said.</p>
