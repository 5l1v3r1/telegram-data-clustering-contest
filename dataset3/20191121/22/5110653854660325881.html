      <h1>Pipeman, Hayman and Timber Tent locations to dance at for Fortnite challenge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:49:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Heck</a></address>
      <p>The Fortnite Trick Shot challenges are out, and although it sounds like you'll need to do 360 backflip 300m snipe shots to accomplish them, the challenges are actually quite simple. One of the simpler ones is "Dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman and the Timber Tent."</p>
      <p>But while it's simple in nature, you probably don't have their locations on the map memorized. So we are here to help guide you to find all three locations.</p>

      <h3>Pipeman on Fortnite map</h3>

      <p>As you could probably tell by the name, the Pipeman is made out of pipes.</p>
      <p>In order to find him, you're going to want to go just south of <b>Misty Meadows</b>. In fact, the location of the Pipeman is very close to the bottom of the map when you pull it up on screen. We have a more direct location of the Pipeman, along with the other dance locations, below.</p>
      <h3>Hayman on Fortnite map</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Fortnite Hayman</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Similarly to the Pipeman, the Hayman is made of, well, hay.</p>
      <p>If you plan to land near <b>Frenzy Farm</b> then you should be able to spot the Hayman as you're close to landing. The Hayman is quite large and is hard to miss, plus his exact location is pretty much right next to where the map says Frenzy Farm is. Just dance in his general vicinity and challenge accomplished.</p>
      <h3>Timber Tent on Fortnite map</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Timber Tent</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Timber Tent can be seen at a location in between <b>Sweaty Sands</b> and <b>Holly Hedges</b>, near a body of water. In fact, it's pretty much located smack dab in the middle of both named locations.</p>
      <p>Just like you did with the Pipeman and Hayman, just activate any sort of dance animation in this area and you'll have completed your challenge.</p>
      <h3>Dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman and the Timber Tent</h3>
