      <p>CHIPPING NORTON, Nov 22 — Big Tech is becoming “too big to fail” and should not saddle ill-equipped consumers with safekeeping privacy for society at large, data whistleblower Christopher Wylie said yesterday.</p>
      <p>From banking to dating, tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon are so integral to modern life that users have become “dependent” and “vulnerable,” said Canadian-born Wylie.</p>
      <p>“By the sheer nature of their scale, they exert a force which currently doesn't have any corrective counter-force,” Wylie said at a conference in Oxfordshire, west of London.</p>
      <p>“You, as a consumer, should not bear the burden of that responsibility,” he said in an interview. “You are not the one that is in a position of knowledge and power, you're not the one making a profit off this activity.</p>
      <p>“So it is unfair,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Wylie gained notoriety for saying his former employer Cambridge Analytica, a now defunct British data analytics firm, used personal information to aid clients.</p>
      <p>The company, with links to US billionaire Robert Mercer and former White House adviser Steve Bannon, was embroiled in a scandal over reports it harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users, beginning in 2014.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hydra</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wylie said the world's dominant technology companies had reached into so many pockets of modern life, “it's like a hydra — you cut off one head and several more grow.”</p>
      <p>Once seen as engines of growth and innovators, tech giants have come under fire on both sides of the Atlantic for allegedly misusing their power and failing to protect users.</p>
      <p>As data privacy concerns grow, countries are scrambling to better regulate the fast-moving firms.</p>
      <p>European Union countries passed the General Data Protection Regulation rules in 2018, viewed as landmark legislation to rein in technology companies and safeguard personal data and privacy.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Kenya approved a data protection law that sets out restrictions on how personally identifiable data can be handled, stored and shared, the government said.</p>
      <p>The USCalifornia Consumer Privacy Act is set to take effect on January 1 and will require large businesses to let consumers opt out of the sale of their personal data.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Banned</b>
      </p>
      <p>Green-haired Wylie, 30, said he had been banned from using Facebook and Instagram social media platforms since he lifted the lid on Cambridge Analytica's practices in 2018.</p>
      <p>He now works with Swedish retail chain H&amp;M on fusing ethics and Artificial Intelligence and spoke to the Thomson Reuters Foundation at VOICES, a Business of Fashion industry gathering.</p>
      <p>Tim Berners-Lee, so-called inventor of the World Wide Web, has also voiced concern over the abuse of data and privacy online, and called for a check on Silicon Valley's power.</p>
      <p>Yet tech experts point to the positives — from tackling diseases to improving transport, and artificial intelligence.</p>
      <p>Many tech companies and internet service providers say they support federal legislation to protect data privacy and giving users more control and transparency over how their data is used. — Thomson Reuters Foundation</p>
