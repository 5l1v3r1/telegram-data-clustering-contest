      <h1>Manila-bound Philippine Airlines flight makes emergency landing in Los Angeles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:21:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.reuters.com/" target="_blank">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>(Reuters) - A Philippine Airlines' flight bound for Manila suffered an apparent engine failure on Thursday shortly after takeoff from Los Angeles and made an emergency landing, authorities said.</p>
      <p>All 347 passengers and 18 crew aboard flight 113, a Boeing Co 777 widebody, are safe, an airline spokeswoman said.</p>
      <p>Pilots of flight 113 declared an emergency and reported a possible engine failure on the 777, Los Angeles International Airport said. A witness on the ground described "bursts of flames" coming out of an engine.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said the plane returned and landed without incident. Television station ABC-7 in Los Angeles aired video of the plane after takeoff that showed flames and smoke coming out of the right engine.</p>
      <p>The plane landed around 12 p.m. local time (2000 GMT) and was met by the Los Angeles Fire Department, the airport said. There has been no impact on other flights.</p>
      <p>While the cause of the apparent engine failure was not immediately clear, it comes as Boeing faces intense scrutiny over twin deadly crashes involving its 737 MAX single-aisle jetliner. The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March.</p>
      <p>Boeing and General Electric, which makes the GE90 engine for the 777 twin-aisle jetliner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
      <p>"You saw bursts of flames, little flames shooting out from the engine," said Andrew Ames, a 36-year-old fitness professional in Los Angeles, who watched as the 777 ascended over the ocean after takeoff. "It almost looked like backfire flames from a motorcycle or car."</p>
      <p>"I had never seen a plane spew flames repeatedly. Then it stopped. As soon as it stopped, I saw the plane bank left, like it was heading back to airport," Ames said.</p>
      <p>The Philippine Airlines spokeswoman said the flight crew noticed smoke in the plane's second engine and declared an emergency landing and returned safely to the airport.</p>
      <p>"All passengers are safe and sound," spokeswoman Cielo Villaluna said. "They are all being assisted to another flight."</p>
