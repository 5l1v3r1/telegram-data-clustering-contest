      <p>There might be a huge rivalry in the making as two highly touted prospects in the world of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma">MMA</a> almost engaged in a brawl at the media day for the upcoming <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/bellator">Bellator</a> London event.</p>
      <p>Widely regarded as the next MMA superstar to come out of Ireland, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/james-gallagher">James Gallagher</a> and Mike Kimbel almost came down to blows when they came across each other at a media event organized by Bellator. (h/t <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/21/20975791/james-gallagher-mike-kimbel-have-to-be-separated-at-bellator-london-media-day">MMA Fighting</a>)</p>
      <p>The incident stemmed from an Instagram comment made by Kimbel that drew the ire of Gallagher and once the pair met, tensions spilled over and ultimately, they had to be separated by other fighters.</p>
      <p>As reported by <a href="https://forums.sherdog.com/threads/mike-kimbel-wants-the-james-gallagher-fight.3866195">Sherdog Forum</a>, Gallagher recently shared an image on Instagram with his mother and Kimbel made a derogatory comment indicating that Gallagher's mother shouldn't have given birth to him. The distasteful comment caught the attention of the Irishman and the moment he saw Kimbel, he landed a punch on him.</p>
