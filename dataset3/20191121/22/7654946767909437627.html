      <p>Thursday night’s NFL matchup featuring the Indianapolis Colts and Houston Texans (8:20. p.m., Fox/NFL Network) looms intriguingly near the expanding AFC championship chase.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the 2019 season, betting markets presumed a two-team race between the dynastic defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots and last season’s AFC runner-up Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
      <p>No other teams were thought ready to make the leap that high up in power ratings.</p>
      <p>Now:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> New England’s offense continues to sputter through a series of unimpressive litmus tests against other contenders. The Patriots beat Buffalo only 16-10, Philadelphia 17-10, and lost badly at Baltimore 37-20.</li>
        <li>Kansas City hasn’t looked like a serious championship threat for weeks. Injuries to MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes are part of the reason. But, KC lost home games to both Indianapolis and Houston before he dislocated his knee (missing market expectations by 16¹/₂ and 10¹/₂ points).</li>
        <li>Baltimore has taken a leap forward while the Patriots and Chiefs were coming back to the pack. Lamar Jackson is making a weekly case to win this season’s MVP. The Ravens are on a four-game winning streak with point-spread covers of 17, 20, 25¹/₂ and 30 points against Seattle, New England, Cincinnati and Houston, respectively.</li>
        <li>Houston and Indianapolis are within striking distance, as one is very likely to win the AFC South to ensure at least one home playoff game.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>VSiN isn’t suggesting the Texans or Colts are currently championship caliber. They are on the short list of teams that can matter in January if the Patriots and Chiefs don’t find better form while the Ravens fall back to earth after peaking too early. Betting markets still see both Thursday competitors as long shots. Here are the latest odds to win the AFC from William Hill (with win percentage equivalents):</p>
      <p>Patriots -105 (51 percent), Ravens 19/10 (34 percent), Chiefs 5/1 (17 percent), Raiders 17/1 (6 percent), Texans 20/1 (5 percent), Colts 30/1 (3.2 percent), Bills 35/1 (2.8 percent).</p>
      <p>Sportsbooks build a universe larger than 100 percent to create a house edge, which is why those seven teams add up to 119 percent by themselves. If the Patriots, Chiefs, (and upstart Raiders) are all overpriced, with Baltimore capable of turning back into a pumpkin, there’s at least a window of opportunity for Thursday’s winner to significantly improve probability.</p>
      <p>Houston has been favored by 3¹/₂ points on its home field through the week. That means “the market” sees the Texans as the superior neutral-field team. Home-field advantage is typically worth three points in the NFL, though some sharps use 2¹/₂ points in divisional games because of site familiarity.</p>
      <p>The line is expected to settle there through game day. A half-point move in either direction likely would inspire one-sided action. Houston laying the key number of three would get hit by sharps and squares alike. Indianapolis +4 would appeal to ‘dog lovers in a game of such importance.</p>
