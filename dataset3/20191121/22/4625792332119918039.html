      <h1>Chuck Schumer PAC accuses sexual assault survivor Joni Ernst of 'not serving the needs of domestic violence victims'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:31:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Larsen</a></address>
      <p>Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic group affiliated with allies of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, accused Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of not "serving the needs of domestic violence victims" despite the Iowa Republican herself being a victim of domestic violence.</p>
      <p>Ernst worked with Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein on a bipartisan Violence Against Women Act, but the efforts fell apart, and Senate Democrats now back their own version. House Democrats previously passed a version of the bill, but it has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>
      <p>Ernst does not support the Democrats' bill because she said it would retroactively and improperly apply restrictions on those convicted of domestic violence or stalking from owning firearms. And she accused Schumer of blocking her bipartisan efforts in order to hurt her 2020 reelection chances, <a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/11/21/ernst-accuses-senates-democratic-leader-of-mansplaining/">according</a> to Radio Iowa.</p>
      <p>The Democratic PAC escalated pressure on Ernst in tweets on Thursday. "[Joni Ernst] is sending a message that she's not serving the needs of domestic violence victims and those in the most vulnerable communities," one tweet said. "Iowans and victims of domestic violence deserve better than Senator Ernst."</p>

      <p>Ernst revealed in January that she was <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/joni-ernst-i-was-raped-in-college">raped in college</a>. She also said that her ex-husband, whom she divorced earlier this year, was abusive during their marriage.</p>
      <p>"I do not need to be mansplained by Chuck Schumer," Ernst <a href="https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/11/21/ernst-accuses-senates-democratic-leader-of-mansplaining/">said</a> Thursday in response to the tweets. "I am a survivor. I’m not afraid of anyone, folks. I have been through the worst of the worst and I am here today."</p>
      <p>Other Republican groups came to Ernst's defense.</p>
      <p>“This is a new low for Chuck Schumer’s Super PAC. Sen. Ernst is courageously fighting for protections for the vulnerable, and we should value her voice and experiences in this discussion,” said Jack Pandol, representative for the Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican PAC affiliated with allies of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.</p>
      <p>The Senate Majority PAC did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.</p>
