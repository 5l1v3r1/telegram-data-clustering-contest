      <p>It was not one of Nigeria’s political rallies that are usually loaded with razzmatazz, but the event ended up having all the trappings of such popular gatherings. In a health and wellness campaign many participants described as unprecedented, people – old and young – of Udo, an ancient town in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State, trooped out <i>en</i> <i>masse </i>to know their health status.</p>
      <p>As early as 8:00 a.m., the venue had been filled with people from Udo town and nearby communities, eagerly waiting to be screened. As usual, many among the participants that stormed the venue were filled with trepidation; unsure of what verdict the test result might give them. But it was a programme thousands of residents of Udo and its environs embraced with glee, regardless of the fact that some feared what might be the outcomes of subjecting themselves to medical tests. The programme was infused with ceremonial splendour with the presence of the traditional ruler of the ancient kingdom, the <i>Iyase </i>of Udo, His Royal Highness Patrick Igbinidu and his chiefs.</p>
      <p>It was a historic event to commemorate the World Diabetes Day, a day set aside globally to focus attention on diabetes and raise awareness about a disease that affects about 425 million adults and 1.1 million children worldwide- including more than five million Nigerian adults. The programme, which enjoyed massive turnout from the locals who relished the mass diabetes screening exercise held at the town’s Comprehensive Health Centre. It was done under the auspices of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH) and supported by Sanofi, a multi-national pharmaceutical company focused on health care and human health.</p>
      <p>This year’s event, which had the theme, “The Family and Diabetes,” also witnessed the inauguration of a Diabetes and Hypertension Clinic (DHC) – a public-private partnership initiative between UBTH and Sanofi. The project was aimed at engendering effective management of the diseases by bringing health  care to the primary level of care and closer to people in underserved communities.</p>
      <p>Lamenting that the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes has become a major public health concern,  Folake Odediran, General Manager Rx and Country Chair, Sanofi Nigeria-Ghana, said diabetes is also a development challenge because the disease forces many people and families into poverty due to catastrophic expenditures on treatment. Odediran blamed low level of disease awareness, inability to access a health worker or health facility, poorly equipped health centres, inadequate number of health workers and inability to afford the cost of treatment as some of the barriers to effective management of diabetes in the country.</p>
      <p>“Diabetes is not only a health problem but also a development challenge. Diabetes forces many people and families into poverty due to catastrophic expenditures on treatment. It also impacts quality of life and undercut productivity. However, the good news is that diabetes can be effectively managed through interventions that include early diagnosis and access to quality health care,” Odediran said.</p>
      <p>The Sanofi boss said the country needs to do a lot of work to remove the barriers that make access to effective health care service difficult for the people.</p>
      <p>“Our purpose is to understand the health care needs of people in places where we  serve and to help in solving those needs. At Sanofi, we recognise that diabetes is a growing public health issue in Nigeria and we are taking definitive steps in tackling the disease burden through collaboration with stakeholders such as the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH),” Odediran said.</p>
      <p>With the clinic in place, people of the state no longer have any reason to lose their precious lives to the two silent killers. She expressed her joy that the project became a reality, adding that the inauguration of the DHC is in fulfilment of the terms of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) that the company signed with UBTH in July this year. “It is a social responsibility project of Sanofi to help strengthen the health system and remove some of the barriers of access to health care by promoting public disease awareness about diabetes and hypertension, up-skilling health care practitioners through training and providing easy access for people in underserved communities to check their health status and receive appropriate medical care.</p>
      <p>“The DHC focuses efforts on the primary level of care and under-served population. Under our partnership with UBTH, the Comprehensive Health Centre in Udo was selected as most appropriate for the DHC project. Having worked collaboratively with UBTH under the leadership of the CMD, we are pleased to inaugurate the DHC at this Comprehensive Health Centre in Udo to commemorate today’s World Diabetes Day. I am confident that this initiative will live to its purpose and serve to the benefit of the people of Udo and Edo  State,” she said.</p>
      <p>Prof. Darlington Obaseki, Chief Medical Director of UBTH, said the event was organised by the hospital not only to mark the World Diabetes Day, but also to mobilise the community to a new awareness about the killer disease and measures to prevent or effectively manage it. The CMD described diabetes and hypertension as the two commonest non-communicable diseases seen in UBTH among adults. According to him, more than half of those who have the two diseases are unaware that they are suffering from them and often present for medical care too late. The screening exercise, he said, is necessary so detect the disease early and take necessary medical intervention to avoid complications.</p>

      <p>Obaseki, a Professor of Histopathology, thanked the <i>Iyase </i>of Udo Kingdom and his council of chiefs for mobilising their subjects to participate in the disease awareness sessions and screening exercise. Prof. Obaseki also expressed delight with the inauguration of the DHC and the support from Sanofi. He commended the people for turning out in their large numbers, even as he urged them to ensure they are screened for diabetes in line with the World Diabetes Day activities. He added that the hospital had mobilised its members of staff to also screen them for other conditions such as hypertension, oral diseases and eye problems.</p>
      <p>The event also featured a lecture delivered Mrs Toyin Ohenhen, an Endocrinologist in UBTH. She said diabetes affects virtually everyone in any society, irrespective of age, gender or race. According to her, there are three main types of diabetes, Type 1 diabetes, Type 2 diabetes and Gestational diabetes, which only occurs during pregnancy. Of the three types, she said Type two is commonest and is due to insulin resistance when the body can’t use insulin efficiently.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of diabetes, according to Dr. Ohenhen, include excessive thirst and hunger, frequent urination, drowsiness or fatigue, dry or itchy skin, blurry vision and wounds that don’t  heal easily. If not properly managed, she said, diabetes can result in many complications, including heart attack or stroke, eye problems, kidney damage and limb amputations, among others.</p>
      <p>She advised people to reduce the risk of diabetes by eating nutritious food, which should include plenty of vegetable and fruits, indulging in regular exercise and generally embracing healthy lifestyles. Also, she said, people living with diabetes need the support of their family to cope with the financial and emotional pressures that accompany a diabetes diagnosis.</p>
      <p>The World Diabetes Day has been designed by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) to raise awareness on the impact diabetes has on the family, to support network of those affected while also promoting the role of the family in the management, care, prevention and education of the condition. Defined as a chronic disease that occurs when the pancreas is no longer able to make insulin, or when the body cannot make good use of the insulin it produces, diabetes kills about four million people annually worldwide and is associated with serious consequences such as stroke, blindness, limb amputation, kidney disease and cardiovascular disease.</p>
      <p>Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas that acts like a key to let glucose from the food we eat pass from the blood stream into the cells in the body to produce energy. Experts say the body’s inability to produce insulin or use it effectively can lead to raised glucose levels in the blood (known as hyperglycaemia), with high glucose levels over a long-term associated with deadly damage to the various organs of the body.</p>
      <p>Also a major public health problem, hypertension is commonly associated with a high level cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide. It remains the major risk factor for heart failure, stroke, coronary artery disease and chronic renal failure in Nigeria. Hypertension, which was initially considered rare in sub-Saharan Africa, is now a major non-communicable disease with a growing prevalence rate. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said growth of the processed food industry has impacted amount of salt in diets worldwide, and that this plays a role in the high rate of hypertension patients.</p>
      <p>Hypertension is one of the leading causes of death the world over. It’s called the silent killer and it kills millions of people every year. High blood pressure (HBP) often has no symptoms. Over time, HBP if untreated, can cause health conditions such as stroke, heart attack, heart failure, arterial aneurysm, chronic kidney failure, damage to the eyesight and kidney damage, among others. Nigeria records more than 1.5 million cases annually. Hypertension is defined by doctors as blood pressure above 140/90, and is considered severe if the pressure is above 180/120 (Ref range=120/80). Its risk factors include salt, obesity, inactivity, alcohol, smoking, stress and genetics. Management includes adopting healthy lifestyle choices such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating balanced diet, cutting back on salt consumption, exercising regularly, reducing alcohol consumption and monitoring blood pressure regularly.</p>
