        <b>VOLUNTEERS told of their shock after a mountain of marine plastic they had cleared from beaches was “flytipped” by a council.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rubbish including nets and fish farm piping — which can’t be recycled at normal sites — has been dumped on local authority land beside Oban Airport in Argyll.</p>

      <p>The haul also included the same plastic taping that led to the death of a stag after it got caught up in it and had to be put down on Jura last week.</p>
      <p>Argyll and Bute Council had agreed to store the waste, which had been carefully sorted by volunteers, until it could be moved on to be recycled.</p>
      <p>But it was dumped earlier this month after space filled up at the council’s yard.</p>
      <p>Today, beach clean-up organiser Janie Steele said: “It’s been flytipped. I was really upset when I saw it.”</p>
      <p>Argyll and Bute Council said: “We hoped to have a container ready but one was not available. We are doing our best to arrange one now.”</p>
