      <h1>Where is ‘College GameDay’ this week? Location, schedule, guest picker for Week 13 on ESPN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:35:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:35</time> by <a rel="author">Zac Al-Khateeb</a></address>
      <p>Who will represent the Big Ten East in the conference title game? That answer may very well be answered on Saturday when No. 9 Penn State visits No. 2 Ohio State for the "College GameDay" game of the week.</p>
      <p>With a win, the Buckeyes could win the East outright; should the Nittany Lions win, they would need only to down a moribund Rutgers the following week team to claim the divisional title. Easier said than done, however; Ohio State is an 18.5 point favorite on the strength of its nation-leading scoring offense (51.5 points per game) and defense (9.8 ppg).</p>
      <p>Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford will need to have a near-perfect game against Ohio State's defense, finding ways to distribute the ball to both running back Journey Brown and receiver KJ Hamler. That will be difficult with Ohio State defensive end Chase Young returning from a two-game suspension. On the other side of the ball, can Penn State defensive ends Yetur Gross-Matos and Shaka Toney keep quarterback Justin Fields and running back J.K. Dobbins out of the end zone?</p>
      <p>We'll find out on Saturday. Until then, here's everything you need to know about "College GameDay" as it visits Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
