      <p>Martin Fowler (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/james-bye/">James Bye</a>) has had a turbulent through months in EastEnders. After he was forced to go on the run with Stacey (Lacey Turner) when she left <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/phil-mitchell/">Phil Mitchell</a> (Steve McFadden) for dead, he only returned when he almost lost his daughter Bex (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jasmine-armfield/">Jasmine Armfield</a>) to a suicide attempt.</p>
      <p>Ben (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/max-bowden/">Max Bowden</a>) took full advantage of his hold over Martin and Stacey, blackmailing Martin into a dangerous life of crime so that he could keep Stacey out of prison. When this accelerated, Martin decided that he would have to protect Stacey by pretending to have cheated on her – and she slapped him and declared their marriage over.</p>

      <p>This has been weighing heavily on Martin ever since and Ben has had an attack of conscience lately and backed off, deciding that he was going to go legit from now on. However, Martin is about to get an even bigger shock when he gets paid a visit – and learns some heartbreaking news which turns his life upside down.</p>

      <p>As these new pictures show, he ends up in an altercation with Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) and a mystery man called Jerome (Chris Charles). Kush Kazemi (Davood Ghadami) has to hold Martin back as he lashes out – but who is Jerome and how is he connected to Stacey?</p>

      <p>Could Stacey have moved on from Martin and ended their marriage once and for all?</p>
      <p>It’s another setback that will send Martin over the rails and culminate in intense scenes this Christmas which sees him take Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) hostage at gunpoint.</p>
