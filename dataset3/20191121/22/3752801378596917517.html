      <p>A defiant Benjamin Netanyahu rejected all allegations of graft on Thursday, vowing to stay on as leader in Israel despite being indicted on a series of corruption charges.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu denounced what he called the "false" and "politically motivated" allegations, hours after being charged by the attorney general with bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>"What is going on here is an attempt to stage a coup against the prime minister," Netanyahu said.</p>
      <p>"The object of the investigations was to oust the right wing from government."</p>
      <p>In a 15-minute speech, Netanyahu railed against his political rivals and state institutions, accusing the police and judiciary of bias.</p>
      <p>The veteran politician argued that it was time for an "investigation of the investigators".</p>
      <p>He vowed to continue as prime minister despite potential court dates and intense political pressure.</p>
      <p>"I will continue to lead this country, according to the letter of the law," he said.</p>
      <p>"I will not allow lies to win."</p>
