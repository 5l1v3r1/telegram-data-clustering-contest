        <b>The latest episode of What Makes A Murderer had Britain’s longest-serving prisoner John Massey confess he doesn’t believe he should be labelled a killer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>On 24 September 1975, John murdered pub doorman Charlie Higgins after a brawl and was subsequently given a 20-year life sentence, which was extended when he escaped three times.</p>
      <p>John became involved in a brawl with doorman Charlie and ended up shooting him after a friend was apparently stabbed in the eye with a broken bottle.</p>
      <p>He later returned with friends armed with ammunition and shot Charlie in the chest at point-blank range with a sawn-off shotgun.</p>
      <p>After 43 years in Pentonville Prison in North London, John still doesn’t believe he should be labelled a ‘murderer’, which enraged viewers tuning in.</p>
      <p>Massey admitted that the thought he was a murderer hadn’t crossed his mind.</p>
      <p>He confessed: ‘We decided to arm ourselves and go back. We wanted to hurt him.’</p>

      <p>When asked how he felt about being called a murderer, the murderer replied: ‘I’m quite resentful of that label. Not only have they labelled me a murderer, they labelled me a pre-meditated, cold-blooded murderer.</p>
      <p>‘A man lost his life, I was responsible for that. But the actual word “murder” was never in my consciousness.’</p>
      <p>Fans weren’t too happy with his logic, saying the 71-year-old seemed like he lacked ‘remorse’.</p>
      <p>One fan tweeted: ‘Scan him again and see if he feels any remorse for taking another mans life.’</p>
      <p>‘The guy basically just said “He got in the way of my gun, therefore he brought this on himself”. Absolutely zero remorse, vile,’ another user complained.</p>
      <p>John escaped prison three times, firstly during an escorted visit in 1994 to see his parents in Kentish Town where he fled to Spain and was extradited three years later.</p>
      <p>The second time was in 1997, and John escaped to his dying father Jack, and the last time was in 2012 to see his mother.</p>

      <p>His last attempt had him scale the nearby prison wall with a makeshift rope and hook at the age of 64.</p>

      <p>During the episode, John admitted that before the murder his life was focused around robbing banks, a path of life that needed to be ‘cold and calculated’.</p>
      <p>The robbery admission made viewers less understanding of the pensioner.</p>
      <p>One viewer commented: ‘John is a thoroughly nasty individual &amp; murderer. He doesn’t appear at all remorseful for anything he has done.’</p>
      <p>‘Doesn’t appear to have any insight on his crimes, takes no responsibility. You’re not kept inside that long for no reason,’ another stated.</p>
