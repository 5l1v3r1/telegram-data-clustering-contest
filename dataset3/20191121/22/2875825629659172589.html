      <h1>Two time Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes retires from boxing</h1>
      <h2>The Belfast fighter also carried the Irish flag in the opening ceremony in Rio before going out at the last 16 stage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:13:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Two time Olympic bronze medallist Paddy Barnes has called time on his boxing career.<br/><br/>Barnes, 32, turned professional after competing in Rio, his third Olympic Games, in 2016, having failed to add to podium finishes in Beijing in 2008 and London four years later.<br/><br/>The Belfast fighter also carried the Irish flag in the opening ceremony in Rio before going out at the last 16 stage.<br/><br/>Barnes can count himself unlucky that, in both 2008 and 2012, he came up against Chinese rival Zou Shiming at the semi-final stage.<br/><br/>Shiming, a three-time world champion, went on to win Olympic gold on both occasions.<br/><br/>Barnes also represented Northern Ireland in the ring at the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games, winning a gold medal at both events at light-flyweight.<br/><br/>He fought out of the famous Holy Family boxing club before becoming a leadership figure in Ireland's High Performance Unit.<br/><br/>After turning pro as part of the MTK stable, Barnes won his first five bouts before challenging for the WBC flyweight title in Windsor Park in August of last year, only to suffer a fourth round KO by Nicaraguan rival Cristofer Rosales.<br/><br/>Barnes subsequently lost two of his next three fights, most recently the October 11 clash with Jay Harris, which resulted in another fourth round knock-out.</p>

      <p>"After taking some time I've come to a decision to retire," said Barnes.<br/><br/>"I've had a great career and achieved so much. I have loved every minute of boxing, it has been my life for the past 21 years.<br/><br/>"I achieved my dream of becoming an Olympian and getting to carry the Irish flag at the Olympic Games opening ceremony. Those moments were the proudest of my career.<br/><br/>"Professional boxing was never a dream of mine but I tried and threw myself into the deep end straightaway.<br/><br/>"It didn't work out but I wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>"I'd like to thank my family for supporting me throughout my entire career, my wife Mari for keeping my feet firmly on the ground and helping me towards my goals".</p>
