      <p>Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Thursday wrote to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on the death of a student bitten by a snake inside her classroom, saying the school’s “crumbling infrastructure” needed urgent attention of the State government.</p>
      <p>He said since Kerala has been a pioneer in establishing quality public schools, the State government and the General Education Department should conduct an infrastructure audit of public schools in Wayanad.</p>
      <p>“I also urge the government to formulate a time-bound action plan for infrastructure upgradation of Sarvajana HSS, and other public schools in Wayanad.</p>
      <p>“I will also be pleased to provide the requisite support for the upgradation of this school under MPLADS,” Gandhi said.</p>
      <p>The Congress leader also requested the state government to provide compensation to the family of the victim.</p>
      <p>“I hope that the state government takes the necessary measures to ensure that no parent has to bear the pain of such a preventable tragedy again,” he said.</p>
