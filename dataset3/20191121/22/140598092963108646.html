      <h1>Steve Bruce: Aston Villa paying £2m for John McGinn is my best ever signing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/luke-edwards/" target="_blank">Luke Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Steve Bruce has described the £2 million Aston Villa spent on midfielder John McGinn as his best recruitment call as a manager and tipped the Scotland international to become one of the Premier League’s most sought after players.</p>
      <p>McGinn had been expected to join Celtic on his departure from Hiberinan last summer but Bruce fought long and hard to get Villa to also bid and somehow managed to land the 25-year-old just before the close of the transfer window.</p>
      <p>Even though the player could have played in Europe with Celtic, Bruce managed to convince McGinn and his family that Villa were the better option, despite the fact they were playing in the second tier in England.</p>
      <p>It was an inspired call, with McGinn proving to be one of the stars of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/05/25/aston-villas-season-has-disappointment-even-win-play-off-final/">last season’s promotion campaign</a> and his progress has been rapid since.</p>
      <p>McGinn has stepped up effortlessly into the Premier League, shining for Villa as they look to settle back in the top-flight, while also excelling for Scotland during the international break. It has fuelled talk of interest from other English clubs, including Manchester United, who could even make a formal offer in January even if Villa are reluctant to sell such a key player.</p>
      <p>“A club like Villa, we didn’t have £2m,” said Bruce, who revealed he feared the Midlands club were going to go bust before new owners pulled them back from the brink of administration.</p>
      <p>“How we got him out of Celtic, I don’t know because his grandfather was the chairman. It took a couple of games of golf at the Belfry with his dad until we could muster the money together.</p>
      <p>“I am delighted for the kid because he is smashing lad. It took him about a minute to win over the Villa supporters because he crashed into a tackle and sprayed a 50 yard pass, and had a shot in first few minutes.</p>
      <p>“He has to be one of my best ever signings because he has the determination to do well.”</p>
      <p>Asked if McGinn was the sort of players Manchester United should be looking to sign as they rebuild the squad with younger, emerging talent, Bruce could not have been more enthusiastic.</p>
      <p>“Yes, he can play at that level,” he said. “From what he has done in the last 12 months, he can only improve… he has done brilliantly. I always knew he would be good, but he has surpassed even my expectations.</p>
      <p>“He can go on to become a really top player. I wish I could find a few more like him. He <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/john-mcginn-double-gives-scotland-comfortable-victory-kazakhstan/">scored twice again for Scotland the other night</a>, so that’s six in three games.”</p>
