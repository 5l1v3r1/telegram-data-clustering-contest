        <b>Gardai have provided an update after 16 people were found in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck during a routine inspection.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardai announced earlier on Thursday that they were investigating potential breaches of immigration legislation which may have occurred onboard a Stena Line Ferry that arrived in <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/breaking-16-people-found-truck-ferry-bound-ireland-343814"><i>Rosslare</i></a>.</p>
      <p>They have since offered an update on the situation, saying that each of the 16 people on board were males, and that one of them may be a juvenile.</p>
      <p>It is also believed that all of the men found are of Middle Eastern origin. The owners are co-operating fully with the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>The driver is a male in his 50's, who's been a resident of Ireland for over 25 years and he is also co-operating fully with the ongoing investigation. The articulated lorry was photographed and examined on the ferry and has now been removed to a secure location for further technical examination.</p>
