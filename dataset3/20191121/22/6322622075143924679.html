      <p>(Nov 22): Asian stocks looked set for a modest rebound Friday as traders awaited further details on U.S.-China trade discussions. Treasuries and U.S. shares dipped.</p>
      <p>Futures pointed higher in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The S&amp;P 500 Index fell for a third day, the longest losing streak in almost two months, but remained within 1% of a record high. The yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed to 1.77% while the dollar edged higher against most G-10 counterparts.</p>
      <p>It’s been a mixed picture on the trade front this week. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He has invited Robert Lighthizer to Beijing for further talks later this month, according to people familiar, and Washington will likely postpone new tariffs scheduled for December even if there’s no deal by then, the South China Morning Post reported. However, President Donald Trump may soon sign into law a bill supporting Hong Kong’s protesters, a decision Xinhua attacked again.</p>
      <p>“The market is looking for some bullish signal that things aren’t going to get worse and that we’re not going to see further deterioration in trade talks between the U.S. and China,” Erin Browne, a portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Bloomberg TV. “They just don’t want to see further escalation.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, oil climbed to a nine-week high as traders latched on to optimistic signals on trade. Gold slipped.</p>
      <p>These are the main moves in markets:<br/>Stocks</p>
