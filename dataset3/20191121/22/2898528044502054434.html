      <h1>Rafael dos Anjos vs. Michael Chiesa in the works for UFC Raleigh on Jan. 25</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:52:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:52</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>A welterweight showdown between former interim title contender <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/796/rafael-dos-anjos">Rafael dos Anjos</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1643/michael-chiesa">Michael Chiesa</a> is currently in the works for the upcoming UFC Fight Night card from Raleigh, N.C. on Jan. 25.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources confirmed the fight to MMA Fighting on Thursday following an initial report from <a href="https://twitter.com/bokamotoESPN/status/1197631634540920832">ESPN</a>. At this time, the UFC has not made any official announcement regarding the fight but verbal agreements are in place from the fighters.</p>
      <p>After kicking off his welterweight career in the UFC with three straight wins including a victory against former champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/91/robbie-lawler">Robbie Lawler</a>, dos Anjos has fallen on harder times lately dropping three of his past four fights.</p>
      <p>The former lightweight champion picked up a win over <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2665/kevin-lee">Kevin Lee</a> back in May but he’s also suffered losses to <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2975/colby-covington">Colby Covington</a>, <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2033/kamaru-usman">Kamaru Usman</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3026/leon-edwards">Leon Edwards</a> in his most recent outing. Now he will attempt to get back on track while facing another former lightweight who is looking to stay undefeated at 170 pounds.</p>
      <p>Chiesa moved to welterweight late last year and immediately picked up a submission win over former interim champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/106/carlos-condit">Carlos Condit</a>. He followed that up with a lopsided decision against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/121/diego-sanchez">Diego Sanchez</a> and how he’ll attempt to go 3-0 in his new division when he faces dos Anjos in January.</p>
      <p>The UFC Fight Night card from Raleigh, N.C. will be headlined by a heavyweight clash between former champion <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/22/junior-dos-santos">Junior dos Santos</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3622/curtis-blaydes">Curtis Blaydes</a>.</p>
