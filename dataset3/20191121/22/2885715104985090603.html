      <p>The Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly, on Thursday confirmed that the thousands of birds which were found dead at Rajasthan’s Sambhar Lake died of avian botulism — a paralytic, frequently fatal disease caused by the ingestion of toxins which are produced by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.</p>
      <p>The investigation was undertaken at IVRI’s Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnosis (CADRAD).<br/>Rajasthan Animal Husbandry Minister Lalchand Katariya has confirmed IVRI’s results.</p>
      <p>“We carried out laboratory tests on samples, as per internationally prescribed methods, to conclude that it is botulism,” IVRI director Dr Raj Kumar Singh said.</p>
      <p>Talking to the media, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said, “It is satisfying that we were already acting on the RAJUVAS report. I have also written a letter to Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, we will request that a secretary, Government of India, should come here.what were the causes of their death, how were these causes created, we want to ascertain all these reasons so that such a situation is not repeated in future.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal Thursday sought a report on bird deaths from National Wetland Authority, State Wetland Authority, Rajasthan State Pollution Control board and Jaipur District Magistrate. A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed that a factual and action taken report be given jointly by these agencies before January 22.</p>
