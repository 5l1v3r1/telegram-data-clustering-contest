      <p>Opposition leader in the legislative assembly Siddaramaiah will himself ensure that Karnataka will be free of Congress, BJP State President Nalin Kumar Kateel said mocking at Siddaramaiah.</p>
      <p>He told reporters in Chikkamagaluru that Siddaramaiah’s only ambition is to become the ultimate ruler of Congress party. In fact, he is a rebellion and speaks according to the situation. The issue regarding M T B Nagaraj’s claim of him handing over a loan of Rs two crore to Siddaramaiah, is a personal issue between them, he said.</p>
      <p>Nalin said BJP has a responsibility to work towards ensuring the victory of MLAs who are contesting the by-elections after resigning from MLAs posts. Kateel to a query said the Chief Minister had expressed regrets on the statement made by minister J C Madhuswamy. But some people are still dragging the issue, for political gains, he added.</p>
