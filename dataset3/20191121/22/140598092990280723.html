      <p>Unai Emery has insisted that he wants to reintegrate Granit Xhaka into the Arsenal team as he suggested that the midfielder could make his return to the side against Southampton this weekend.</p>
      <p>Emery has previously <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/08/unai-emery-admits-under-fire-former-captain-granit-xhaka-may/">questioned whether Xhaka would ever play for the club again,</a> revealing that there had been discussions with the club hierarchy about selling the midfielder in January after he was stripped of the captain’s armband.</p>
      <p>The Arsenal head coach has softened his stance over the international break, though, saying that Xhaka could still have a future in north London despite his <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/10/31/granit-xhaka-apologises-arsenal-fans-reveals-horrific-abuse/">remarkable outburst towards his own supporters when he was booed at the Emirates last month.</a></p>
      <p>Emery spoke with Xhaka on Thursday morning and revealed that the midfielder’s “mindset” is better following the international break.</p>
      <p>“My objective is going to be his comeback, to help us and convince every supporter of his commitment to us and [that] his performances will be better, and they will be proud of him in the short or long future with us,” Emery said.</p>

      <p>“He is feeling better and also feeling that his team is Arsenal now. He wants to come back with confidence with the supporters, and we are going to decide [when]. I think little by little we can help him come back and connect with us and our supporters.</p>
      <p>“At the moment it is important how he feels. He told me this morning he is very convinced to help the team. The first [match] is Saturday and I am going to decide if it is a good moment or if we need more time to help him for the team.”</p>
      <p>Emery cited other examples of players who have lost the support of the fans and then returned to the side as proof that Xhaka can still win back the faith of the Emirates crowd.</p>
      <p>“For example with Hector Bellerin,” Emery said. “He told me two weeks ago he struggled here with the supporters sometimes when his performance was not the best.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes playing with the team in the Emirates or away. Also we have some other players who have had that situation. They come back. With Xhaka I want to do the same.</p>
      <p>“The first question is [not to] forget his mistake, but he can come back showing his good commitment, his good behaviour and good performances, helping and defending the Arsenal team. That is the objective. He is a good guy, a good player and he loves and respects Arsenal a lot.”</p>
