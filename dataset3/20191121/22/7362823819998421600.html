      <h1>Was same-sex behavior in animals hardwired from the beginning?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:16:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:16</time> by <a rel="author">Christopher Carbone</a></address>
      <p>It's possible that scientists have been examining same-sex sexual behavior in animals incorrectly.</p>
      <p>A study published Monday in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1019-7?utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution</a> posits that researchers should be asking "why not?" instead of why in terms of animals engaging in same-sex behavior (SSB).</p>
      <p>"Usually, when evolutionary biologists see a trait that's really widespread across evolutionary lineages, we at least consider the idea that the trait is ancestral and was preserved in all those lineages," Julia Monk, a doctoral candidate at Yale University, who co-authored the new research, told <a href="https://www.livescience.com/same-sex-behavior-is-old.html">Live Science</a>. "So why hadn't people considered that hypothesis for SSB?"</p>
      <p>According to Live Science, researchers have seen same-sex sexual behavior as posing a conflict: Scientists have wondered why animals would spend time doing something sexual that doesn't involve passing on their genes to future generations. Still, same-sex sexual behavior has been seen in 1,500 species.</p>

      <p>The scientists make a point in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1019-7?utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_medium=affiliate">their study</a> of not using words like "gay" or "straight" or any term that humans use to describe sexuality.</p>
      <p>The reearchers hypothesize that the oldest sexually reproducing animals tried to mate with any or all members of their species, regardless of sex.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/same-sex-behavior-is-old.html">According to Live Science</a>, the authors argue that this path could've made sense as a way to compensate for the fact that distinguishing traits between males and females are "energetically costly" to evolve.</p>

      <p>Caitlin McDonough, a study co-author and doctoral candidate at Syracuse University, said the new hypothesis undercuts old assumptions about same-sex behavior, including the notion that it is costly in comparison with different-sex behavior.</p>
      <p>"You really need to go through those assumptions and test the costs and benefits of both behaviors in a system," McDonough said.</p>
      <p>Monk said that if same-sex behaviors go back to the roots of animal evolution, the fact that these behaviors are so common today makes sense.</p>
