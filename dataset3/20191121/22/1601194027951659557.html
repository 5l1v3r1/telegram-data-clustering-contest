      <p>We've always believed that <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/alberto-del-rio">Alberto Del Rio</a> is not quite liked by the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> officials backstage and that the doors of another return could be shut for good.</p>
      <p>However, surprisingly enough, they are indeed open.</p>
      <p>The former WWE Superstar was interviewed by TMZ Sports and he spoke about a potential return to the company.</p>
      <p>The topic of CM Punk returning to the company to be a part of WWE Backstage was mentioned before Del Rio was asked about him coming back to WWE someday.</p>
      <p>Here's what Del Rio revealed during the interview:</p>
      <blockquote>“The door has always been open for both sides. I’m not against their business and they’re not against my business. At the end of the day, I understand now as a promoter, nothing is personal. When you’re an athlete, sometimes you think your boss doesn’t agree with you because he doesn’t like you but it’s nothing personal.” H/t Credit: <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/watch-alberto-del-rio-addresses-possible-wwe-return">WrestlingNews.co</a></blockquote>
      <p>Del Rio also revealed that he is still in touch with wrestling promotions in the United States and that he is planning to work in and around the squared circle in 2020.</p>
      <p>Del Rio's time with WWE has been one topsy-turvy ride, Despite achieving great success as a main event level Superstar, he was fired in 2014 for alledged unprofessional conduct after he fought with an employee backstage.</p>
      <p>The 4-time WWE Champion would return to the company in 2015 before leaving a year later as an unhappy talent whose promises were reportedly broken by WWE.</p>
      <p>He has been a vocal detractor of WWE in the past and it's astonshing to think that there is still hope to see the 42-year-old back in the WWE. We're not so sure that the fans would want to see him back but it's still quite surprising when you recall the earlier situation.</p>
      <p>Del Rio is currently preparing for an MMA Fight against UFC legend Tito Ortiz which will take place at the Combate Americas show in Texas on December 7th.</p>
