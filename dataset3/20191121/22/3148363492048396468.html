      <h2>An Army veteran is now able to speed through life thanks to the gift of a motorized chair which he received through a donor on Tuesday.</h2>

      <p>Army veteran Scott Miller of Albia, Iowa, received the chair through Electric company ITC Midwest after the <a href="https://iowapva.org/pages/About_Iowa_Paralyzed_Veterans_of_America.html">Iowa chapter of Paralyzed Veterans of America</a> chose Miller to receive the chair.</p>
      <p>“It’s awesome pretty overwhelming really,” Miller <a href="https://ktvo.com/news/local/army-veteran-receives-motorized-chair-that-has-him-moving-through-life-at-a-new-speed">told</a> KTVO. ” It’s quite the chair. It will be a lot for somebody to afford on their own. ITC doing this really helps a guy out to get out in the woods, and get back out and be active.”</p>
      <p>Executive Director of the Iowa chapter of Paralyzed Veterans of America Kim Gould said that Miller’s chair is the sixth chair ITC Midwest has purchased for the charity.</p>
      <p>The cost for each chair is not cheap either, as each power chair runs for about $13,000 each, Gould said.</p>
      <p>In October, PVA’s Iowa Chapter presented ITC Midwest with the Keith M. Griggs Chapter Service Award for their efforts to support veterans, according to a statement on ITC Midwest’s <a href="https://www.itc-holdings.com/newsroom/newsroom-details/itc-midwest-provides-action-trackchair-to-iowa-veteran">website</a>.</p>
      <p>“It does make us feel good as employees we can do a small part to help these veterans who have served our country and sacrificed their time,” said Dusky Terry, ITC Midwest president. “It’s a way for us to show our appreciation for that.</p>
      <p>Miller said that one of the first places he will be speeding off in his new chair is in the woods, where he enjoys spending his time.</p>
