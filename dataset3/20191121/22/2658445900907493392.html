      <p>The Ogun State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has taken a swipe at the Allied  Peoples Movement (APM), and its candidate at the March 9, governorship election, on their plan to appeal the judgment of tribunal at the Supreme Court.</p>
      <p>The Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, Oyo State, has dismissed the petition filed by the APM candidate, Adekunle  Akinlade, against the victory of Governor Dapo Abiodun.</p>
      <p>In a unanimous decision, the Appeal court justices said the appeal “lacks merit and it is therefore struck out.”</p>
      <p>In the lead judgment, Justice Muhammed Ambi-Usi Danjuma declared that the 10 grounds filed by the Akinlade and his party challenging the victory of Abiodun have no merits and that the two appellants were overruled because of lack of merit.</p>
      <p>The judgement reads: “The respective objections raised by the two respondents are overruled and the emotions have no remit, answers to them are sustained and the two motions are dismissed.”</p>
      <p>However, the APM and it’s candidate told the media last weekend that they will be approaching the Supreme Court as the last port of call in gubernatorial election petition.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>In a statement, the Ogun APC Publicity Secretary,  Tunde Oladunjoye said the “APM and it’s candidates are serial losers who are merely”</p>
      <p>He said: “Our party, the APC has unshakeable confidence in the judiciary, the APM and its candidate are serial losers who are merely shadow-chasing and being goaded by a senator, another well known serial loser at tribunals”.</p>
      <p>“Prince Dapo Abiodun won unanimously at the Ogun Governorship Petition tribunal, we also won unanimously at the Appeal Court, they should be told that despite the boasts of their main sponsor, the court judgement is not for sale.”</p>
      <p>“The three-man state governorship election petitions tribunal, led by Justice Yusuf Halilu, while dismissing the petition and upholding Abiodun’s election, described Akinlade’s petition, challenging  Abiodun’s victory,  as  “lazy and destined to fail”.</p>
      <p>“This has exposed the lack of depth, procedurally contaminated and virus-invested petition to the whole world. The reason why they want to go to the Supreme Court is driven by the empty boast of the Senator financing APM, who is dropping the name of Mr. President.”</p>
      <p>“We advise them to get to get off their phantom horse and stop dragging the name of Mr. President into disrepute. The court is not for traders, neither is the apex court’s judgement for sale.”</p>
