      <h1>The 'Dolly Parton Heartstrings' Cast Includes A Famous 'DWTS' Alum</h1>

      <p>Some of Dolly Parton's most beloved songs are being brought to life courtesy of <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/will-heartstrings-return-for-season-2-dolly-parton-has-a-huge-song-catalog-19358527">the <i>Dolly Parton's Heartstrings</i> cast</a>. The new Netflix anthology series transforms eight Parton tunes — "Jolene," "These Old Bones," "If I Had Wings," "JJ Snead," "Two Doors Down," "Down From Dover," "Sugar Hill," and "Cracker Jack" — into TV episodes that, at upwards of 60 minutes each, act more like mini-movies.</p>
      <p>As in previous recreations of her music — like 2015's <i>Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors</i>, in which she appeared as the narrator — <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/dolly-partons-heartstrings-review-1256536">Parton appears at the</a> outset of every <i>Heartstrings </i>episode to introduce the stories, and she also makes acting cameos throughout the show. But it's the rotating cast of actors who do the brunt of the storytelling. It's still characteristically Dolly; she's just letting others take the lead.</p>
      <p>Among the dozens of actors featured throughout the series, avid pop culture fans will recognize a number of faces from movies and TV, including Dallas Roberts (<i>The Walking Dead</i>), David Denman (<i>The Office</i>), and Virginia Gardner (<i>Marvel's Runaways</i>). But because there are almost too many to count, here are the 13 biggest names to look out for when <i>Heartstrings </i>hits Netflix on Friday, Nov. 22.</p>
      <h3>Julianne Hough</h3>

      <p>Triple threat Julianne Hough portrays the infamous beauty beyond compare from Parton's "Jolene." To promote the show, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/11/18/dolly-parton-and-julianne-hough-issue-jolenechallenge-fans/4234835002/">Hough and Parton issued a #JoleneChallenge</a> asking people to send in their best renditions of the popular song.</p>
      <h3>Kimberly Williams-Paisley</h3>

        <figcaption>Tina Rowden/Netflix</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Considering the <i>Father of the Bride </i>star is married to Brad Paisley, she knows a thing or two about country music. Her <i>Heartstrings</i> character is the one who pleads with Jolene not to steal her husband, like in the lyrics. But in the episode, Jolene and Williams-Paisley's character also have a friendship.</p>
      <h3>Kathleen Turner</h3>

      <p>Kathleen Turner isn't taking as many roles as she did back in the '80s and '90s, when she appeared in movies like <i>Peggy Sue Got Married</i> and <i>Romancing the Stone</i>, but she told <i>People</i> <a href="https://people.com/tv/kathleen-turner-had-to-say-yes-when-dolly-parton-asked-her-to-play-a-hill-woman/">that when Parton called her directly</a> to ask her to play the mountain woman thought to be a witch in "These Old Bones," she couldn't turn her down.</p>
      <h3>Ginnifer Goodwin</h3>
      <figure>
