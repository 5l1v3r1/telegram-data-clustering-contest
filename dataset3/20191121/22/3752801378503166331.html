      <p>Three suspected illegal miners who emerged from a shaft in Orkney with a dead body earlier this month are expected to return to court next week to face charges of illegal mining, trespassing and the illegal possession of gold-bearing material. </p>
      <p>The accused - aged 35, 37 and 43 - were arrested at the ventilation shaft leading into the No. 6 shaft in Orkney on November 15.</p>
      <p>"The accused were arrested after mine security followed up on a tip-off that the trio had surfaced with a corpse which was covered with bags. The dead man has been identified.</p>
      <p>"However, circumstances surrounding his death are still being investigated," police spokesperson Colonel Adéle Myburgh said.</p>
      <p>They appeared in the Orkney Magistrate's Court on Monday and were denied bail. Their next appearance will be on November 25. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, two suspects - aged 45 and 36 - are expected to return to the Klerksdorp Magistrate's Court on November 26 for a formal bail application after they were found in possession of illegal explosives and gold dust. </p>
      <p>The pair were arrested on Monday at a house between Klerksdorp and Wolmaransstad. </p>
      <p>"The police received information about suspected illegal miners who were seen entering a house. The accused were arrested after being found in possession of explosives, copper cable and gold dust," Myburgh said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
      <p>They appeared in court on Tuesday on charges of possession of explosives, destruction of critical infrastructure, possession of gold, possession of copper and aluminium and possession of gold-bearing material.</p>
