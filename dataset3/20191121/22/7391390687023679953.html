      <h1>Your Complete Shawn Mendes &amp; Camila Cabello Relationship Timeline, From PDA To Tattoos</h1>
      <address>
        <time datetime="2019-11-21T22:05:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:05</time>
      </address>
      <p>Pop singers and now-confirmed lovers<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-fell-in-love-while-working-on-senorita-19367961"> Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes's relationship timeline</a> has been a hot topic as of late, and it all but reached fever pitch back in August, when they got just close enough onstage to kiss at the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards...before pulling away. A month later, they finally locked lips at one of Mendes' concerts in Toronto (more on that later), but there was <i>still</i> no confirmation that they were together — just a whole lot of paparazzi pics and online fodder.</p>
      <p>It took a whole three-ish months (and lots more kissing) for Mendes to finally use the word "dating" in reference to Cabello. During a Fan Q&amp;A in Adelaide, Australia, he revealed<a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/shawn-mendes-camila-cabellos-relationship-began-on-a-national-holiday-19280853"> they'd been official since July 4th.</a> So at this point, they've been together for just under five months.</p>
      <p>That might not be a long time, but the the two musicians knew each other for several years before getting romantically involved — since 2014, to be exact — which could be why they took things slow in the beginning (you know, aside from all that PDA). Now that they are together, though, let's reminisce on how it all came to be, shall we?</p>
      <h3>2014: They Met</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/are-shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-dating-their-recent-outings-have-sparked-romance-rumors-18174721">Cabello and Mendes first crossed paths in 2014</a> when they were both opening for Austin Mahone. Mendes had not yet released his debut album; <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/200792-why-did-camila-cabello-leave-fifth-harmony-she-shouldnt-have-to-explain-her-decision">Cabello was still a part of Fifth Harmony</a>. Five years may not seem that long ago on paper, but in the pop music world? It might as well be a full century. Needless to say, a great deal has changed since they met on Austin Mahone: Live on Tour.</p>
      <p>In their recent joint interview with <i>V</i> magazine, <a href="https://vmagazine.com/article/v-magazine-presents-shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello/">Mendes and Cabello waxed nostalgic about the moment</a> they first met. Cabello said, “I remember thinking we met on the Austin Mahone tour, and I remember I wanted to hang out with you, but you were always on the tour bus, just learning guitar.” Mendes admitted that he “didn’t talk to anybody,” and then went on to add,</p>
      <blockquote>“You were the only person that talked to me. Like, you were the only one of everybody on that tour who would say words to me. Actually, I think if we go into our DM’s or something, there’s a photo from the day we met, I think.”</blockquote>
      <p>Important question: Where did Mendes get the gigantic ice cream sandwiches that are in that picture? (Follow-up question: Those are ice cream sandwiches, right?)</p>
      <h3>September 2014: They Shawnyboy’d</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>This would be <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2015/08/25/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-flirt-on-twitter/">one of the many tweets Shawmila shippers </a>added to their evidence boards.</p>
      <p>Around this time, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/47722-austin-mahone-camila-cabello-are-dating-they-confirmed-it-in-an-adorable-way">Cabello and Mahone were in a relationship</a>. In November 2014, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/50988-why-did-austin-mahone-camila-cabello-break-up-hey-things-happen">Cabello confirmed they'd split up</a>.</p>
      <h3>2015: They Collaborated</h3>
      <p>Shawn Mendes on YouTube</p>
      <p>2015 was a big year for Shawmila, because that was the year the two pop stars joined musical forces for the first time. That November, Cabello and Mendes released “I Know What You Did Last Summer," a song they wrote together while hanging out backstage at Taylor Swift’s 1989 World Tour.</p>

      <p>More like "I Know What You Did Backstage At One Of Taylor Swift's Concerts," no?</p>

      <p>The two pop stars attended the same VMAs afterparty and <a href="https://www.j-14.com/posts/shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello-go-to-a-2015-video-music-awards-after-party-together-68802/">were spotted leaving in the same car</a>. Gotta love a carpool situation.</p>

      <p>When Cabello was posing for photos at the 2015 iHeartRadio Music Festival, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J1xjsbaHzo">Mendes snuck up behind her</a> and gave her a fright.</p>
      <p>The Monday after the festival, E! News reported that an insider claimed <a href="https://www.eonline.com/uk/news/698295/new-couple-alert-shawn-mendes-is-dating-fifth-harmony-s-camila-cabello-get-the-scoop">Mendes and Cabello were a couple</a>. Mendes and Cabello would go on to deny such reports.</p>
      <h3>November 2015: They Talk Showed</h3>
      <p>The Late Late Show with James Corden on YouTube</p>
      <p>Near the end of 2015, Mendes and Cabello appeared on <i>The Late Late Show with James Corden. </i>In the interview, they talked about being pop stars, their joint single, and, of course, their relationship status. The duo told James Corden that they weren’t dating, haven’t shared any make outs, and are just good buddies. Corden seemed less than convinced.</p>

      <p>When speaking to <i>People</i> in October 2016, <a href="https://people.com/music/shawn-mendes-never-dated-really-good-friend-camila-cabello/">Mendes addressed the rumor</a> regarding whether or not he and the "Never Be the Same" singer were romantically linked. He told the magazine,</p>
      <blockquote>“A thing? No, we weren’t, actually. We’re just really close friends. She is one of those people who is just very easy to connect with and still, to this day, is one of my greatest friends. You find that instant connection with people, and she’s one of them.”</blockquote>
      <h3>May 2017: They Cried In The Club</h3>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/ShawnMendes/status/865539536721281024" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Camila_Cabello/status/865785615169630208">Mendes took to Twitter after Cabello </a>dropped “Crying In the Club, her first post-5H single. He wrote, “speechless.. goosebumps all over. You’re incredible.” Cabello replied, “i love u SO much and i miss u even more than I love u thank u for being such an amazing friend.”</p>
      <p>Later this year, it was reported that Mendes and Hailey Baldwin were a thing. They never confirmed it, but they did <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/are-shawn-mendes-hailey-baldwin-dating-the-pair-has-addressed-the-romance-rumors-before-9111179">attend the Met Gala together</a> the following May. A few months after the 2018 Met Gala, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/shawn-mendes-comments-on-hailey-baldwin-justin-biebers-engagement-show-theres-no-drama-between-them-9811490">Baldwin was engaged to Justin Bieber</a>.</p>
      <h3>January 2018: They Were Just Friends Some More</h3>

        <figcaption>Tim Boyles/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Here is what Cabello said when <i>Zach Sang Show</i> host<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6S-cVgx-Kc"> Zach Sang brought up Mendes</a> in 2018:</p>
      <blockquote>“We never hang out, but we’re always texting. We’re always talk on the phone. We’re never in the same place at the same time, but we’re always texting about random stuff. We talk about <i>Harry Potter</i>. He was working his album and he said he needed some help because he was going to sing a line in Spanish, so I voice memoed him the correct pronunciation. I love Shawn. He’s a real friend. I actually sent him my album before it even came out.”</blockquote>
      <p>About a month later, E! News reported Cabello was spotted <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/913020/camila-cabello-and-dating-coach-matthew-hussey-pack-on-the-pda-in-mexico#photo-886558">on vacation with dating coach Matthew Hussey</a>.</p>
      <h3>May 2018: They Professed Their (Platonic?) Love For One Another</h3>

        <figcaption>Brad Barket/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And here is what the "There's Nothing Holding Me Back" singer said when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0EJnnljToI">Zane Lowe brought up Cabello </a>later that year:</p>
      <blockquote>“She is my favorite person in the whole world. I don’t think you’ll ever meet somebody who can feel emotion like her, in all aspects. She can feel hurt like no other, and she can feel love like no other. It’s really amazing. I remember when we wrote ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer,’ in the studio with her, just her love for what she believed in was just so powerful that it kind of just pushed me to make an entire album out of inspiration of the one night, you know what I mean? I’m so proud of her, truly.”</blockquote>
      <h3>February 2019: They Went To The Grammys</h3>
      <figure>

Cabello opened the show with "Havana" alongside Ricky Martin, J Balvin, Young Thug, and Arturo Sandoval; Mendes sang "In My Blood" with Miley Cyrus.</p>
      <h3>June 2019: They Collaborated Again</h3>
      <p>YouTube</p>
      <p>And what a collaboration it was. "Señorita" and its piping hot music video were released on June 21, and it quickly climbed to the<a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/chart-beat/8528339/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-senorita-number-one-hot-100"> top spot of the Billboard Hot 100.</a></p>
      <p>Days after “Señorita” dropped, E! News reported <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1052300/camila-cabello-and-matthew-hussey-break-up-reports">Cabello and Hussey split up after one year</a>.</p>
      <h3>Summer 2019: They Canoodled A Lot</h3>

      <p>On Aug. 8, Mendes turned 21. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B08zxPaHRFQ/">Cabello wished him a happy birthday on Instagram</a> with a throwback photo. "Happy birthday to this magic human," she wrote. "I love you!!!!</p>
      <h3>August 2019: They Booped Noses At The VMAs</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Whew, the 2019 VMAs was quite the night for Shawmila. Mendes and Cabello cuddled in the crowd, won the award for Best Collaboration, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6gdUM3ffRQ"><i>almost</i> smooched during their performance of "Señorita."</a> A Shawmila smooch never happened, but a nose boop sure did. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/camila-cabello-shawn-mendes-vmas-performance-had-shippers-losing-their-minds-video-18695989">Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner</a> were among the many humans who were very disappointed when they realized Mendes and Cabello would not give us more than a nose boop.</p>
      <p>What Shawmila do next? We'll just have to boop in to find out.</p>
      <h3>September 2019: They Kissed On Stage &amp; Made Out On Instagram</h3>
      <figure>
        <embed-post data-src="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2TF8KbgR5o" data-service="Instagram"/>
      </figure>
      <p>After being caught in<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a28925793/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-dramatic-kissing-pda-pics-toronto/"> multiple acts of PDA by paparazzi</a>, Mendes and Cabello recreated their VMAs performance at his concert in Toronto. Except this time,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2F1SGZH7zO/"> they actually kissed.</a></p>
      <p>Then, later that month, they decided to troll everyone who made fun of how they kissed by...well, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2TF8KbgR5o/">kissing some more.</a></p>
      <p>"So we saw on Twitter and stuff you guys saying stuff about the way we’re kissing and how it looks weird, like we kiss like fish," Mendes said. “So we just want to show you how we really kiss." Cabello then dramatically (and jokingly) lapped his face like a puppy.</p>
      <p>On Sept. 19, TMZ cameras stopped Mendes in the airport, where he (very awkwardly) confirmed that him dating Cabello is "<a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/09/19/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-relationship-not-publicity-stunt-i-love-you/">definitely not a publicity stunt."</a></p>
      <p>On Sept. 27, fans grilled him during a pre-concert Q&amp;A. One asked if he'd ever been in love with someone who didn't love him back. He immediately<a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1177961518299791361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1177961518299791361&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glamour.com%2Fstory%2Fcamila-cabello-shawn-mendes-relationship-timeline"> mentioned his "Señorita" duet partner.</a> "If I told you the whole story of Camila, it would take a long time," he said. "I would say that you have to fight for someone you really love. And if you really truly love them, you'll get them.”</p>
      <h3>October 2019: They Drop The "L" Word</h3>

        <figcaption>Roy Rochlin/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>On Oct. 3, Cabello told UK's <i>Capital Breakfast</i> radio show that she and Mendes were "<a href="https://twitter.com/CapitalOfficial/status/1179653750195138561">pretty happy,</a>" adding "I really, really love him a lot.”</p>
      <p>In an interview with <i>The Sun, </i>she explained that their close friendship made it scary to cross the line into romance. Still, she admitted that she's seen him as more than a friend for a long time.<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10069657/camila-cabello-scary-dating-shawn-mendes/"> "Definitely there were feelings</a>, but I think we were just too young to know what to do with them," she said.</p>
      <p>At the end of the month, Mendes did that aforementioned Australian Q&amp;A, finally <a href="https://people.com/music/shawn-mendes-reveals-when-he-and-camila-cabello-started-dating/">confirming he and Cabello are together.</a></p>
      <h3>November 2019: More PDA, Tattoos &amp; A Grammy Nom</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>On Nov. 11, the couple went to a Los Angeles Clippers game, where they weren't shy about their relationship.</p>
      <p>Shortly afterward, they got tattoos together. According to <i>People</i>,<a href="https://people.com/style/shawn-mendes-camila-cabello-get-tattoos-together/"> it was Cabello's first</a>. She got "it's a mystery" written on her pinky finger, a nod to <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>, and Mendes got the letter A behind his ear for his little sister, Aaliyah.</p>
