      <p>Ant &amp; Dec's live links are once again giving us some TV gold on I'm A Celebrity and the lads were on top form again on Thursday night with a political jibe.</p>
      <p>While this year's <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> lineup are giving us plenty to talk about - with the new episode giving us <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-jungle-jail-argument-17297478">a jungle spat</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/nadine-girls-aloud-dance-caitlyn-17297610">Caitlyn Jenner dancing to Girls Aloud</a> - the Geordie duo's quips are the reason many people tune into the ITV show night after night.</p>
      <p>So far they've taken swipes at Prince Andrew's 'sweat-gate' scandal, as well as being left stunned by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-ant-dec-brexit-17297659">Roman Kemp's impressions of them.</a></p>
      <p>And on Thursday night's show they got political by referencingÂ  Brexit during one of their links. <i><b>As you can see in the video above taken from ITV</b> </i>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Ant &amp; Dec</a> likened the issue that continues to divide the nation to the Jungle Jail House vote that caused a rather heated disagreement in camp, with Ant saying "There's an argument to say that if you don't like the result of a vote, you can't just have another vote until you get the result you want."</p>
      <p>And they also had a message for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other politicians ahead of next month's crunch General Election.</p>
