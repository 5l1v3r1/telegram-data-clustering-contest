      <p>In September, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would be pursuing a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump.</p>
      <p>The decision came in light of a whistleblower complaint that the president sought to use foreign power for his own political gain during a phone call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, by asking that Ukraine investigate the son of former Vice President Joe Biden. The president later confirmed that his administration withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine but denied that it was done for leverage.</p>

      <p>Last month, the House of Representatives approved a resolution that formalized the inquiry and outlined the public-facing portion of the impeachment inquiry, which includes Wednesday’s hearing.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday was the first day of televised hearings in the impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump. Though Fox News was the early ratings winner among cable news channels, ABC actually topped the key adults 25-54 demographic when looking across all of TV.</p>
      <p>Fox News beat the other broadcast and cable news networks in viewership during both days of the impeachment inquiry hearing coverage last week to deliver its highest-rated week of the year in total day viewership.</p>
      <p>The week of Nov. 11 brought in Fox News’ highest viewership since the 2018 midterm election, according to Nielsen ratings.</p>
