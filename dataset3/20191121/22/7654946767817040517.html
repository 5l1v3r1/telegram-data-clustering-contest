      <h1>Ben Affleck to direct Congo movie, ‘King Leopold’s Ghost’</h1>

      <p>Ben Affleck is leaving Gotham City and heading to the Congo.</p>
      <p>The “Batman” star, 47, is set to direct and produce “King Leopold’s Ghost,” a factual drama about Belgium’s King Leopold II exploitation and pillage of the Congo in the late 1800s, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/ben-affleck-direct-congo-plunder-tale-king-leopolds-ghost-belgian-king-leopold-ii-1202791265/">reports Deadline</a>.</p>
      <p>Based on the Adam Hochschild book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/King-Leopolds-Ghost-Heroism-Colonial/dp/0618001905?tag=nypost-20">King Leopold’s Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa</a>,” the film written by Farhad Safinia will cover the historical period from the Congolese perspective when Leopold took ownership of the Congo Free State and forced locals to harvest the land for rubber and ivory.</p>
      <p>The book, which also was the source material for a <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455581/">2006 documentary of the same name</a>, estimates that about 8 million were killed in his cruel quest for riches. The film will focus on the natives who fought back against the brutal King Leopold II.</p>
      <p>Affleck, who reportedly worked on “King Leopold’s Ghost” for several years when it was considered for a limited series, has ties to the Central African country. According to Deadline, he founded the Eastern Congo Initiative which works with and advocates for the people as a catalyst for economic and social development.</p>
      <p>Affleck will produce the movie through his production company, Pearl Street Films, along with Martin Scorsese’s Sikelia Productions.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear whether Affleck will take on “King Leopold’s Ghost” as his next movie since he’s currently filming “Deep Water,” directed by Adrian Lyne and co-starring Ana de Armas.</p>
      <p>The actor recently <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/14/trailer-for-ben-afflecks-latest-film-finally-released/">finished “The Way Back,”</a> directed by Gavin O’Connor, and the Dee Rees-directed crime drama mystery “The Last Thing He Wanted.” He’s also starring and directing World War II-era drama, “Ghost Army.” Affleck will also co-star in Ridley Scott’s “The Last Duel” alongside Matt Damon and Adam Driver as well as Robert Rodriguez’s mystery, “Hypnotic.”</p>
      <p>Affleck made his directorial debut in 2007 with “Gone Baby Gone” and went on to direct “The Town” (2010) and “Live By Night” (2016). He won an Oscar for Best Picture for 2012’s “Argo,” which was based on a true story.</p>
      <p>The actor, who divorced 47-year-old Jennifer Garner in 2018, is <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/10/23/ben-affleck-looking-for-love-on-dating-app-raya/">currently online dating</a> after splitting from “Saturday Night Live” producer Lindsay Shookus.</p>
