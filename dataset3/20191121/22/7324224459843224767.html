      <p>“Seeing someone who was having a struggle years ago, and to still see that struggle today in a new way, it hits home.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it was preaching. I think it was reigniting that fire, like these issues are still going on today, it’s going on now. Let’s be aware of what’s going on.</p>
      <p>“It’s refreshing to do that to a younger audience, and also to a family so you can have that conversation within a household.</p>
      <p>“It’s good to have those conversations and let kids know the past.”</p>
      <p>Fellow cast member Bradley Walsh said the episode would have won an award if it was a standalone drama, and did not contain aliens.</p>
      <p>The historic show nevertheless caused anxiety among the production team on the BBC series.</p>
      <p>Showrunner Chris Chibnall was concerned about the idea of visiting a moment in history which was so topical.</p>
      <p>He said: “We worried. Absolutely had sleepless nights. I worried about it from the start.</p>
      <p>“We really wanted to tell that story. It was part of the reason that I took the job doing the show, was to tell stories like that.”</p>
      <p>The showrunner has promised more historical episodes in the upcoming series of Doctor Who.</p>
      <p>Doctor Who will return with a new series in early 2020.</p>
