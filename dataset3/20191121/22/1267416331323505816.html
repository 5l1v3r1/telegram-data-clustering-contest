      <h1>Microsoft Surface Earbuds delayed until spring 2020 in U.S.</h1>
      <h2>It's unclear how this delay will change the Canadian launch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T22:48:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/02/surface-earbuds-hands-on/">Microsoft’s Surface Earbuds</a> were supposed to launch in the U.S. “later this year,” but the company’s plans have changed. The Redmond-based tech giant has delayed the release of the wireless earbuds until spring 2020.</p>
      <p>This is according to a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/panos_panay/status/1197575990194520065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1197575990194520065&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmobilesyrup.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D692474%26action%3Dedit">Panos Panay (@panos_panay)</a>, Microsoft’s chief product officer.</p>

      <p>Panay explains that Microsoft wants to “deliver the best possible experience…” before launching the earbuds. However, he didn’t go into any real specifics for the delay.</p>
      <p>Microsoft revealed the truly wireless earbuds at its conference in October, alongside the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/02/surface-pro-x-7-laptop-3-hands-on/">Surface Pro X</a>, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/10/02/surface-pro-x-7-laptop-3-hands-on/">Surface Pro 7 and Surface Laptop 3</a>.</p>
      <p>While the launch was planned for this year in the United States, a Canadian release date for the Surface Buds has yet to be announced. With the delay in the United States, it’s unclear how this will affect the product’s launch in Canada.</p>
