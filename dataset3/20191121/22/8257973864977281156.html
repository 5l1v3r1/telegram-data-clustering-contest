      <h1>Sheriff: Shooter used 'ghost gun' in California high school shooting</h1>

      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- The teenager who opened fire at a Southern California high school last week killing two people used unregistered parts to build what sheriff's officials are describing as a "ghost gun."</p>
      <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva on Thursday said the shooter, Nathaniel Berhow, used a "<a href="https://abc7.com/weapon-used-in-saugus-high-shooting-was-kit-gun-authorities-say/5710822/">kit gun</a>" to carry out <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/14/At-least-2-dead-3-injured-in-shooting-at-LA-area-high-school/4841573748472/">the shooting</a> Nov. 14 at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita. Police said the 16-year-old used the .45-caliber gun to shoot five classmates, killing two, before turning the gun on himself.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/15/Accused-suspect-in-Southern-California-school-shooting-dies/9641573823370/">He died</a> of a gunshot wound to the head a day later.</p>
      <p>Because it was a kit gun, Villanueva said the firearm was unregistered.</p>
      <p>"The mystery is trying to piece together who assembled what and at what point in time," he said.</p>
      <p>"They're sold as a kit. You can legally buy it, assemble the weapon yourself and then you have a gun that is not registered and no one knows that you have it, and that is very dangerous."</p>
      <p>He said customers can buy kit guns that are already 80 percent assembled at gun shows.</p>
      <p>Police said they found <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-21/santa-clarita-shooting-45-caliber-gun-saugus-high-attack-a-ghost-gun-sheriff-says">multiple weapons</a> owned by Berhow's late father at the teen's home. Many were unregistered.</p>
      <p>Investigators, trying to determine a motive for the shooting, are attempting to gain access to the teen's cellphone.</p>
