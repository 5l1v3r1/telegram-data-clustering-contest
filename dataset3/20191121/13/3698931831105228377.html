      <h1>One of Malaysia’s first digital telcos is shutting down</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:10:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>After two years, <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2017/09/27/ookyo-5-things-you-need-to-know/">Ookyo</a>, the digital telco under Maxis is shutting down. Existing users will be switched automatically to Hotlink RED effective 21st January 2020.</p>
      <p>According to their <a href="http://www.ookyo.com.my/">website</a>, they will no longer accept new registrations online. However, for those that have recently signed up, your new SIM will still be delivered and you can enjoy Ookyo until they switch you over to Hotlink prepaid.</p>

      <p>As an exclusive offer to existing Ookyo subscribers, you will get to enjoy 8GB of data with non-stop social (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and Pinterest) that’s valid for 30 days at only RM30/month (Normal price: RM45/month) for the first 12 months on Hotlink RED. If you have any existing balance on Ookyo, it will be transferred to your Hotlink RED account and you can manage it via the Hotlink RED app.</p>
      <p>If you have existing Google Play wallet balance, you must utilise it before 20th January 2020. Any leftover amount will not be transferred. You can find out more in the <a href="https://ookyo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036448211">FAQ</a>.</p>

      <p>Ookyo is one of Malaysia’s first digital telco that’s managed entirely via an app and you pay for it like a streaming subscription. The service was launched several months ahead of Digi’s <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/01/11/tapp-is-digis-new-prepaid-service-that-lets-you-customise-your-own-plan/">tapp</a> and Celcom’s <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/01/29/yoodo-officially-revealed-malaysia-fully-customisable-mobile-plan/">Yoodo</a>. Ookyo’s key proposition is unlimited data for your favourite apps at only RM30/month. If you need more, you can purchase unlimited passes for individual apps. On top of that, you can get 10% cash back in the form of Google Play credits for every spend you make.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There are a couple of restrictions when it comes to Ookyo. Firstly, it requires a <a href="https://ookyo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360028460792-Why-do-I-need-to-allow-VPN-access-and-how-does-it-work-">VPN</a> in order to enjoy unlimited data. Without it, your usage will deduct from your main data bucket of 8GB. The last time we checked, the VPN feature is only available for Android and that means iOS users <a href="https://ookyo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=ios">will not be able</a> to enjoy the full unlimited experience. Perhaps the most annoying issue is customer service as users are forced to interact with a chatbot which doesn’t seem to be reliable.</p>
      <p>If you’re an Ookyo user, will you continue to stay on as a Hotlink RED user? Or would you switch to another provider? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
