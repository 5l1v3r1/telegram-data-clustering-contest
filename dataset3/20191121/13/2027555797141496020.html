      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:42:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar, who is still in the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital, is doing "much better", her family said on Thursday, adding they can't comment further.</p>
      <p>Mangeshkar, 90, was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital after she complained of difficulty in breathing last week.</p>
      <p>"Lata Ji is doing much better now. Beyond this, we can't comment. Please respect our privacy," Mangeshkar's niece Rachana Shah told PTI.</p>
      <p>The hospital sources refused to comment on the status of the veteran singer's health.</p>
      <p>In her over a seven-decade long career, Mangeshkar has sung more than 30,000 songs across languages.</p>
      <p>She is considered one of the greatest playback singers in Indian cinema. She received the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, in 2001.</p>
