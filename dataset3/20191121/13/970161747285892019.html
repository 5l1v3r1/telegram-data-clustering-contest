      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! campmate Caitlyn Jenner could be hit with massive financial repercussions for talking about the Kardashians and Jenners in the jungle.</p>
      <p>Since arriving in Down Under, the former Olympian has revealed that her family is aware that she’s on the ITV competition show and has even spilled <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/">details about her step-daughter </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/"> as well as talking about her relationship with Kanye West</a>, for which she might be slapped with a hefty fine.</p>
      <p>While we’re all thirsty for Caitlyn to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/">spill all the tea about the famous brood</a>, it seems highly likely that non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) will be stopping her from going ham.</p>
      <p>An NDA is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship, with the parties agreeing sensitive information they may obtain will not be made available to any others.</p>

      <p>Speaking about what Caitlyn might have agreed to before going on the series, Elliot Fry, a Senior Associate at Cripps Pemberton Greenish, exclusively told <b>Metro.co.uk </b>that multiple contracts from Kris Jenner to Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner could have been thrown into the mix.</p>
      <p>‘Given the people involved and the importance and value of their reputation, it’s difficult to rule out NDAs being in place between family members,’ he began.</p>

      <p>‘In addition, given the number of commercial third parties involved (for instance, the producers of Keeping Up With the Kardashians) we would expect there to be a number of NDAs in place providing some level of protection to the family’s activities.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘A correctly structured and scoped NDA can be a very powerful tool to protect confidential information.</p>
      <p>‘If an NDA is breached the usual remedies are to claim damages (cash) and/or seek an injunction (basically asking the court to tell someone to do something or not do something) to stop any more sharing of information which is subject to the NDA.</p>

      <p>‘Damages in situations like this, given the value of the Kardashian brand and its importance to their earnings, could be very high (if they were pursued), and therefore NDAs used in this scenario could meaningfully bite.’</p>

      <p>The Kardashians and Jenners aren’t shy when it comes to making their nearest and dearest signing NDAs either.</p>

      <p>Back in February, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/02/26/jordyn-woods-nda-kardashian-jada-pinkett-smith-red-table-talk/">TMZ</a> revealed that Jordyn Woods might have violated her contract with the family by appearing on Jada Pinkett Smith’s Red Table Talk.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_73141802.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C809&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>At the time, sources told the publication that she had signed an NDA ‘which prohibits her from disclosing details about the lives of Kris, Kim, Khloe and the rest of the brood.’</p>
      <p>More recently, <a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/08/kim-kardashian-makes-mom-friends-sign-non-disclosure-agreements/">Radar Online</a> claimed that Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kim makes friends sign NDAs before going for coffee with them in a bit to keep her private life under wraps.</p>
      <p>‘Kim’s not very popular with a lot of her kids’ friends’ moms, because she’s so paranoid about even having a basic conversation with them,’ an insider alleged.</p>
      <p>‘She swaggers around like she’s royalty and when she does make a new acquaintance the first thing she makes them do is sign an iron-clad agreement that prohibits them from discussing anything about her at all.’</p>
      <p>So while we’d love to hear all the goss about all the goings-on in the infamous family, we’re not going to hold our breath.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Metro.co.uk has contacted Kim’s reps for comment. </i>
