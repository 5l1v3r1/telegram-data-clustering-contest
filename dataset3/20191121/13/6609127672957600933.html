        <b>RANGERS star Ryan Jack played at Aberdeen for seven years between 2010 and 2017.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> ace turned out to be a great player for the Dons, as he came through the youth ranks to make his mark on the first team and eventually skipper them.</p>

      <p>The Scotland international played with some great players such as Adam Rooney, Niall McGinn and Jonny Hayes.</p>
      <p>However, its one other familiar name who has popped up to give fans a laugh with a baby-faced throwback picture.</p>
      <p>Cove Rangers ace Fraser Fyvie, who played with Jack at the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14898/aberdeen/">Dons</a> for three years in the first team, shared the snap on social media.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old revisited their youth days in the north-east with a classic picture.</p>

      <p>Both have grown up considerably since then, but the duo are still recognisable all the same despite their baby faces.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter, Fyvie said: "What about that for a #ThrowbackThursday guess who ðŸ‘€."</p>
      <p>The ex-Dundee United midfielder became Aberdeen's youngest ever player in 2009 when he made his debut at 16-years-old.</p>
      <p>He then moved on to Wigan Athletic, who were in the Premier League at the time.</p>
      <p>Jack gained his dream move to Ibrox in 2017, when he was signed by Pedro Caixinha.</p>
      <p>He played both games for Scotland as Steve Clarke's side marched to victory against Cyprus and Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>He started alongside Celtic's Callum McGregor in midfield, with John McGinn in a more advanced role.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a move for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4978667/rangers-alfredo-morelos-saint-etienne/">Rangers star Alfredo Morelos is now unlikely for Saint Etienne in January, according to reports</a>.</p>
      <p>The Gers ace has been on incredible form for club and country this campaign, bagging 23 goals in all competitions.</p>
      <p>The Colombian's red-hot strike rate has attracted attention from clubs around Europe, and yesterday it was said that French outfit Saint Etienne were the latest to be keen.</p>
      <p>However, according to Le10sport, the Ibrox club have been labelled as 'being greedy' over their main man.</p>
      <p>The media outlet in France say that a summer move is far more viable as they cooled talk of an advance for the hitman in the winter window.</p>
