                            <p>The match that Mourinho is speaking of, is from Tottenham’s friendly encounter with Real Madrid in the summer during their tour of Asia. Tottenham won that match 3-2. Tanganga was given the responsibility to mark Ronaldo. Considering his age and inexperience, he did very well to keep up with one of the best to have played the game.</p>
                            <p>However, not many took notice of the performance because of the platform it had come under. This just shows why Tottenham have hired the Portuguese. He has an incredible attention to detail that many would miss. But this leads us to our next question,</p>
                            <h3>Who is Japhet Tanganga?</h3>
                            <p>Japhet Tanganga is a Hackney-born defender. He has been at Tottenham since he was 10 years old and has risen through the ranks to make it to their senior squad. He made his debut for the club in last year’s pre-season against Girona.</p>
                            <p>His proper debut for the club came in the Carabao Cup away loss to Colchester United on September 24<sup>th</sup> this year. However, he is yet to feature in the Premier League for the side. As a result, he has rejected Tottenham’s initial contract proposal, with his contract coming to a close at the end of the season.</p>
                            <p>With Mourinho marking him as one for the future however, Tanganga could have a change of heart. There is also the curious case of the possibility of both Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen leaving the club next summer, making Tanganga’s passage to the first team much more easier.</p>
