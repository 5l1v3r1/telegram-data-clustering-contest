      <p>The U.S. used the PKK-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) as mercenaries during the Syrian conflict, according to Sefin Dizayi, head of the Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG) Foreign Affairs Department.<br/><br/>Speaking at a panel organized by the Washington Institute on Wednesday, Dizayi said, "The YPG has been used like mercenaries against a specific enemy and were abandoned after its duty was completed." He added that the U.S. disregarded the future and fate of the civilians in the region, which has become a complete mess following the YPG.</p>
      <p>He also claimed that a U.S. official had told him that they would abandon the YPG once their duty was done.</p>
      <p>Dizayi said the U.S. saw the YPG as a potential military power, thus supported them against Daesh. He noted that the terrorist group lost 11,000 members in the process.</p>
      <p>The U.S. has provided military training and given truckloads of military support to the YPG under the pretext of fighting Daesh, despite security concerns from its NATO ally, Turkey.</p>
      <p>The KRG official also acknowledged Turkey's concern about YPG presence near the border, saying that the PKK's direct involvement as an actor in Syria created a threat for Turkey, which shares a 910-kilometer border with the country.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 9, Turkey launched Operation Peace Spring, the third in a series of cross-border anti-terror operations in northern Syria, targeting terrorists affiliated with Daesh and the YPG, to secure its borders and prevent the establishment of a terror corridor.</p>
      <p>Referring to Washington's warnings of sanctions on Turkey, Dizayi said this would also affect the oil trade with the KRG and that the situation of the KRG should be considered.</p>
      <p>Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Hundreds of thousands of people have since been killed and more than 10 million others displaced, according to U.N. figures.</p>
