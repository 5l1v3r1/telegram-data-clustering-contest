      <p>Nergal’s blackened blues project <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/me-and-that-man/">Me And That Man</a> have big plans over the coming months, according to the man himself.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/behemoth/">Behemoth</a> frontman and mastermind behind the dark folk outfit recently signed with Napalm Records for the next Me And That Man album, which is <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/nergal-to-release-new-me-and-that-man-album-next-year/">scheduled for release next year</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pleasure to be working with a brand new team of people on a project which in many ways is brand new to me,” says Nergal. “We have some big surprises for you in the coming months so keep ‘em peeled. The record has been a lot of hard work; some blood, some tears but just wait and see, it was totally worth it!”</p>

      <p>“As I’ve been a Johnny Cash fan for many years, Songs Of Love And Death (debut MATM album) turned out to be like a memorial to the country music god himself,” adds Sebastian Münch from Napalm Records. “Nergal’s creative and musical brilliance redefined an entire genre, and the album’s dark and sinister vibes were most certainly noticed in distant Nashville.”</p>
      <p>The first Me And That Man album featured Nergal alongside acclaimed musician John Porter, who departed the project last year. There has been no official word on a potential replacement or new members.</p>
      <p>Behemoth have a busy year ahead too. They’re heading out with <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/slipknot/">Slipknot</a> across the UK and Ireland in January 2020, before returning to the UK to <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/behemoth-and-judas-priest-are-headlining-bloodstock-2020/">headline Bloodstock festival in August</a>.</p>
