      <h1>Apple has a new strategy to prevent another buggy launch like iOS 13</h1>
      <h2>The new development strategy aims to catch bugs before the software update reaches customers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:31:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/aisha-malik" target="_blank">Aisha Malik</a></address>
      <p>Apple is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/apple-ios-14-features-changes-testing-after-ios-13-bugs?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social">changing the way it tests</a> new versions of iOS and iPadOS to prevent another buggy debut like the launch of iOS 13 in September.</p>
      <p>The tech giant is working on a way to ensure that test versions of upcoming software updates disable incomplete or buggy features by default, according to a recent report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/apple-ios-14-features-changes-testing-after-ios-13-bugs?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social"><i>Bloomberg</i>.</a></p>
      <p>The software testers will then be able to use a new settings menu called ‘Flags,’ which allows them to isolate the effect of each new addition to the system. This would allow Apple to identify when a recently added feature or line of code isn’t functioning, and then be able to issue a fix for the problem before it reaches customers.</p>
      <p>It’s not surprising that Apple is changing that way it tests its software updates considering how the launch of iOS 13 was a bug-filled mess. Apps were launching slowly or crashing altogether, and there were issues with the Messages and Mail apps.</p>
      <p>There was also a bug that would allow third-party keyboards to <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/09/24/ios-13-ipados-bug-third-party-keyboards-full-access-permission/">gain full access permission</a>, allowing them to communicate with other apps and capture keystroke data.</p>

      <p>Apple is in the process of developing iOS 14 and is debating if it should push some of the features to iOS 15 to allow for more time in development.</p>
