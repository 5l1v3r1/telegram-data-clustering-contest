      <p>Xiaomi seems to be very ambitious about foldable smartphones, like all the major smartphone manufacturers. The company recently <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomi-may-be-working-on-a-razr-like-clamshell-foldable-phone-and-it-might-look-like-this/">filed a patent</a>(published by China National Intellectual Property Administration), which talks about a clamshell foldable smartphone, similar to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/motorola-razr-officially-announced-will-be-available-for-1500-from-verizon/">Motorola’s RAZR foldable phone</a>.</p>
      <p>Now based on the previous patent, folks at <i>WindowsUnited</i> have <a href="https://windowsunited.de/360-video-4k-render-xiaomi-mi-flux-mit-falt-display-erwacht-zum-leben/">produced</a> a 360-degree video and high resolution render images, giving us some ideas about what Xiaomi’s clamshell foldable phone could look like.</p>

      <p>In Xiaomi’s yet-to-be-announced RAZR-like foldable phone, you can see a rectangular screen at the front, and at the back, there is a dual-camera setup. Taking selfies with the smartphone will require you to unfold the device as the selfie camera is going to be located on the upper bezel in the interior.</p>

      <p>Just for a quick refresher, Xiaomi <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomis-upcoming-folding-phone-leaked-online-again/">posted a 10-second teaser in early 2019, giving us a few glimpses of what its foldable smartphone might look like</a>. The device folds inwards from both the left and right side, producing a compact sandwich which passably resembles a phone, especially with the power button on top.</p>
      <p>Aside from Xiaomi, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-teases-clamshell-folding-galaxy-fold-2-at-sdc-2019/">Samsung too, is working on a foldable clamshell smartphone</a> and as per sources, it is going to launch the device at Mobile World Congress 2020.</p>
