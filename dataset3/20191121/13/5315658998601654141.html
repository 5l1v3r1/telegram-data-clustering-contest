        <b>"Firearm collection events on this weekend – less than one month to go"</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is now less than one month to go until the amnesty and buy-back for prohibited firearms and parts ends on 20 December 2019.</p>
      <p>Time is running out for those of you who have not yet handed-in your prohibited items and want to be compensated.</p>
      <p>You need to get online, notify Police of your intention and get to a Police-run collection event near you.</p>
      <p>Collection events will be held on Friday 22, Saturday 23 and Sunday 24 November in Clyde, Cromwell and Roxburgh.</p>
      <p>The event on Friday will be at the Clyde Earnscleugh Hall from 10am to 2pm.</p>
      <p>The Saturday event will be at the Cromwell Racecourse from 10am to 2pm and Sunday’s event at the Roxburgh Golf Club from 9am to 1pm.</p>
      <p>For those firearm owners who are still unsure about whether their firearm is prohibited, you need to get onto Police’s website or call 0800 311 311 to check.</p>
      <p>Don’t leave it until after 20 December 2019 to discover they are.</p>
      <p>From 20 December 2019 it will be illegal to have any of these prohibited items in your possession - don’t risk prosecution and losing your firearms licence.</p>
      <p>The laws won’t be changing – so don’t hold out.</p>
      <p>For more information go to <a href="http://www.police.govt.nz/">www.police.govt.nz</a> or call 0800 311 311.</p>
      <p>ENDS</p>
