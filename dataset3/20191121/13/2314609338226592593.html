      <h1>'Prudence and mutual obligation' to underpin Labor budget policy: Albanese</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Wright</a></address>
      <p>Anthony Albanese will promise a Labor government would underpin its budget management with "prudence and mutual obligation" in a speech on Friday that will commit to reforms to get the economy growing faster.</p>
      <p>The Opposition Leader will use an address in Brisbane to map out a broad economic blueprint for Labor, ditching Bill Shorten's "top end of town" rhetoric for a consensus-based approach backing "wealth creation as well as its fair distribution".</p>

      <p>In comments also targeted at Labor frontbenchers keen to spend their way back into office, Mr Albanese will argue business confidence needs to be restored with a tax system that encourages firms to invest in their operations and their workers.</p>
      <p>Friday's address is the second Mr Albanese has delivered since the release of the internal review of Labor's May 18 election loss, with the focus on rebuilding key themes for the party.</p>
      <p>Mr Albanese will argue that his early life, raised by a single mother on an invalid pension in a council house, would be a cornerstone for how he would approach budget management.</p>

      <p>Declaring he appreciates the "value of a dollar and the importance of managing money", he will attempt to link his lived experience to how Labor will govern the nation's finances.</p>
      <p>"Prudence and mutual obligation are values I learnt growing up and they are values that I will take to fiscal policy," he will say. "I want our economic framework to have a soft heart and a hard head.</p>
      <p>"I want to lead a fiscally responsible Labor government that invests with an eye firmly fixed on productivity."</p>
      <p>Mr Albanese will align himself with both the economic reforms of the Hawke-Keating era and with the response of Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan to the global financial crisis, which meant Australia was one of just three countries to avoid falling into recession.</p>
      <p>But he will argue Labor cannot just rely on these past examples of policy development, making clear economic priorities have to drive new ideas.</p>
      <p>"We have now reached the limits of the Hawke-Keating reforms. And new challenges require new impetus," he will say.</p>
      <p>"Labor's fiscal approach will be aligned to our economic priorities, which will first and foremost be to lift our nation's productivity."</p>
      <p>The immediate priorities for Labor will be around energy policy, the national broadband network and large-scale infrastructure including high-speed rail links.</p>
      <p>Mr Albanese will argue the planned increase in the superannuation guarantee levy to 12 per cent, which some members of the government want to abandon, would be vital to boosting infrastructure investment in the future.</p>
      <p>He will also commit Labor to taking up microeconomic reform as the main way to lift productivity and increase wages for ordinary workers.</p>
      <p>"Our fiscal priorities will be integrated with our long-term objectives to increase our productivity and, in turn, our living standards and social mobility," he will say.</p>
      <p>His address follows <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53chf.html">$3.8 billion of infrastructure announcements this week by Prime Minister Scott Morrison</a>.</p>
      <p>In a note to Liberal Party supporters, Mr Morrison on Thursday said the government was sticking by its overall economic plan in the face of international headwinds and domestic softness driven by the drought.</p>

      <p>"For Australia, challenges are not new. We will meet them, optimistically, practically and soberly," he said.</p>
      <p>"Now is not the time for Australia to lose our nerve. It is once again time to demonstrate our confidence in the future and stick to a plan. To invest, employ and work together to meet and beat the challenges ahead."</p>
