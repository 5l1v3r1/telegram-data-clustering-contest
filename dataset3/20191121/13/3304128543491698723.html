      <p>Nairobi Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti has ordered the Standard Chartered Bank to produce bank statements showing the transactions between Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC), the bank, and Tripple A Capital in Ksh827 million graft case.</p>
      <p>This is after prosecution witness said bank records produced in court had been destroyed, prompting the magistrate to summon bank officials in court.</p>
      <p>According to the witness, the statements were destroyed by the bank after the defence opposed the use of photocopies, saying it will only accept original copies.</p>

      <p>Former KPC managing director Shem Ochuodho, former chairman Maurice Dantas and a director of Tripple A are accused of defrauding KPC Ksh827 million.</p>
      <p>The three, according to a court ruling, hoodwinked the attorney-general’s office, Finance and Energy ministries into approving a refinancing deal with Tripple A that led to the loss of the millions between May 2003 and June 2004.</p>
      <p>Dr Ochuodho, who was sacked from KPC in December 2004.</p>
