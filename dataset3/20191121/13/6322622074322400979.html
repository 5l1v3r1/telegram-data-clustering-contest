      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): Sime Darby Property’s first 100%-owned retail mall is scheduled to be opened in March 2020. The KL East Mall located at the 160-acre integrated KL East development in Taman Melati, Kuala Lumpur, has a gross built-up of about 1.2 million sq ft and a net lettable area of 384,210 sq ft.</p>
      <p>Sime Darby Property Acting Group CEO, Datuk Wan Hashimi Albakri Wan Ahmad Amin Jaffri, said that KL East Mall aspires to become the catalyst for Sime Darby Property's KL East development. It is positioned as a boutique lifestyle retail mall that will serve the surrounding neighbourhood of middle- to middle-upper income brackets.</p>
      <p>“KL East Mall is in an ideal position to enjoy a primary catchment of 1.28 million population with healthy purchasing power, through a total household income of RM29.5 billion per annum. The mall is also well positioned to attract a large student population, as there are various education institutions within its proximity.</p>
      <p>“We expect to see more people coming to KL East, once developments in the area are fully complete. The growth in population will help transform KL East into a future business and education hub, making KL East Mall perfectly poised to reap the benefits of its thriving population,” Wan Hashimi said during the announcement of its key tenants including Jaya Grocer, Camp5, MBO, Blue Ice-Skating Rink, Toys ‘R’ Us, Harvey Norman, Jungle Gym and Café Chef Wan at an event yesterday.</p>
      <p>KL East Mall centre manager Dylan Chan said the shopping centre’s current occupancy rate is also highly encouraging.</p>
      <p>“To date, KL East Mall has over 75% occupancy. Retailers within the mall had been carefully selected to provide visitors with incomparable shopping options,” she added. <i>— EdgeProp.my</i></p>
