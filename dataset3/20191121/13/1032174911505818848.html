      <p>Popular Sydney bakery and patisserie <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/shops/black-star-pastry">Black Star Pastry</a> is opening a pop-up in Melbourne next week, and will be sticking around until April. And its equally famous <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/food-and-drink/article/how-its-made-black-star-pastrys-watermelon-cake">Strawberry Watermelon Cake</a> – <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/magazine/strawberry-watermelon-cake-recipe.html">dubbed “Australia’s most Instagrammed dessert” by <i>the New York Times</i></a> – is coming too.</p>
      <p>Owner and pastry chef Christopher Thé started Black Star in Newtown 11 years ago (before that he was at Sydney’s <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/restaurants/quay">Quay</a>), and has since expanded with three more shops in Sydney and a number of pop-ups across the country, including <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/black-star-pastry-returns-melbourne">one in Carlton in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>“Not a day went by that we weren’t asked on our social media channels when we were going to be back, so for us it just made sense to [do it again],” says Black Star general manager Josef Murray.</p>
      <p>This time the patisserie is heading south side, with a storefront in St Kilda under Jackalope Pavilion, which is home to the equally Instagrammable immersive art experience <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/art-and-design/article/walking-between-raindrops"><i>Rain Room</i></a>).</p>
      <p>“Acland Street is almost synonymous [with] traditional cakes and bakeries in this part of Melbourne,” says Murray. “We’re really excited to be in this area.”</p>
      <p>Black Star’s cakes are known for their intricate layers, fresh flavours and photogenic slices. Expect to see shelves lined with the Strawberry Watermelon Cake (a combination of almond <i>dacquoise</i> (meringue cake); rose-water cream; fresh watermelon, strawberries and grapes; and a semi-sweet jelly) alongside other favourites from the Sydney stores, including the refreshing Raspberry Lychee Cake, the rich Pistachio Lemon Zen cake with white-chocolate mousse, and three other cakes.</p>
      <p>There’ll be a new cake range too, although Murray is staying mum before the big reveal – but we do know that Melbourne customers will be the first to get their hands on them.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately the lamb shank and red wine pie (one of <i>Broadsheet</i>’s picks for <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/guides/best-meat-pies">best meat pies in Sydney</a>) won’t be making an appearance, but expect to see a number of new savoury options, including a vegetarian ratatouille danish and an asparagus and ‘nduja pastry with a spicy kick.</p>
      <p>All Black Star Sydney outposts serve coffee from roaster Little Marionette, but here they’ll be using beans from <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/cafes/st-ali">St Ali</a>.</p>
      <p>The pop-up opens on Monday, November 25 at 7am, but we suggest rocking up earlier (though soon you’ll be able to skip the line by ordering online). Black Star St Kilda will be here until at least Easter 2020, when Thè will be serving his popular hot cross buns.</p>
      <p>“We are looking to eventually – hopefully – set up a shop here full-time,” Murray says. “I think Melbourne is excited to have us and we’re excited to be here, so we’re definitely looking to become a permanent fixture.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Black Star opens at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/cPFRnSU9Tr6G32YaA">2C Acland Street, St Kilda</a> on Monday, November 25. It will be open Monday to Friday from 7am to 4pm, and weekends from 8am to 5pm.</i>
