      <h1>Gold Technical Analysis: Remains vulnerable below 100-day SMA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:35:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/haresh-menghani" target="_blank">Haresh Menghani</a></address>

          <b>The recent corrective bounce from three-month lows falters ahead of 100-DMA.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bears might now aim to challenge monthly swing low, around the $1445 region.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> seems to have stalled its recent corrective bounce from three-month lows and witnessed a modest pullback from previous support, now turned <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> near 100-day SMA.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, the commodity has been trending lower over the past two months or so along a descending trend-channel, which clearly points to a well-established near-term downtrend.<br/> <br/>This coupled with the fact that technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart">chart</a> have struggled to recover from the negative territory add credence to the commodity’s near-term bearish outlook.<br/> <br/>Hence, some follow-through weakness, possibly towards $1457-55 intermediate support en-route monthly swing lows around the $1445 region, now looks a distinct possibility.<br/> <br/>The latter coincides with 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the $1265-$1557 positive move and is closely followed by the lower end of the descending trend-channel, around the $1440 region.<br/> <br/>Failure to defend the mentioned support levels might be seen as a key trigger for bearish traders and pave the way for an extension of the recent pullback from multi-year tops.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, immediate resistance is pegged near the $1481-82 region (100-DMA), above which the commodity is likely to aim back towards the key $1500 psychological mark.<br/> <br/>The momentum could further get extended towards the trend-channel resistance, currently near the $1509-10 region, which if cleared might negate any near-term bearish bias.</p>
