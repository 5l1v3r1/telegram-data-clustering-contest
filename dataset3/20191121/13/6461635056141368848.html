      <h1>5 Strikers Barcelona could sign in January to bolster their attack</h1>

      <h3>Football Club Barcelona are in desperate need of an attacker who can make his mark on the scoreboard alongside Lionel Messi. The club has been heavily criticized for being overly reliant on the Argentine and will look for reinforcement in January.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona are looking to reinforce their attacking options, with Suarez becoming injury-prone as he ages and <a href="https://everythingbarca.com/2019/11/09/france-coach-urges-patience-for-le-petit-prince/"><b>Antoine Griezmann</b></a> still taking his time to settle with Barca since his summer transfer from Atletico Madrid. Ansu Fati and Ousmane Dembele are two youngsters who show immense potential to become great assets for the club but require time to reach their full potential.</p>
      <p>Barca’s over-reliance on Messi is evident when the squad fails to perform if the talisman is having a quiet day, and because of this reason, the Spanish giants are actively searching for a Striker who can help bolster their attack.</p>
      <p>let us take a look at 5 potential strikers Barcelona could sign in January,</p>

      <h4>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</h4>
      <p>Aubameyang is currently under contract with Arsenal until 2021, but the club’s ability to qualify for the Champions League this season plays a crucial role in keeping their superstar in North London. Emery’s side are currently in sixth place and eight points behind the top four.</p>
      <p>The Spanish giants are <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/barcelona-enter-pierre-emerick-aubameyang-20834572"><b>reportedly</b></a> impressed with the 30-year-old’s pace and power and Barcelona’s board believes they can lure the Gabonese striker away from Premier League as they can offer him Champions League football.</p>
      <p>The skipper is yet to sign a contract renewal with The Gunners and is waiting for the Catalonian club to make an offer. [<a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/aubameyang-postpones-contract-talks-with-arsenal-waiting-for-barca-7744334"><b>Sport</b></a>]</p>

      <h4>Lautaro Martinez</h4>
      <p>Inter’s Lautaro Martinez is currently the favorite to strengthen Barca’s frontline, especially because of his good relationship with Captain Lionel Messi which was showcased in Argentina’s previous two outings.</p>
      <p>The latest <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/the-curious-clause-in-barca-target-lautaro-martinezs-contract-7743973"><b>reports</b></a> claim that the player has a release clause in his Internazionale contract, which values him at 111 million euros, but only for 15 days in the month of July. Basically making it possible for Barca to sign the Argentine within those days but at that hefty price.</p>
      <p>Martinez is currently under contract until 2023 but has been heavily regarded as the perfect replacement for Luis Suarez. He has great control over the ball and is capable of creating space as well as being a great box player.</p>

      <h4>Erling Haaland</h4>
      <p>Erling Haaland has recently made a name for himself in European football with his dominant performance with RB Salzburg, especially in their Champions League campaign, having scored seven goals in four CL matches.</p>
      <p>The Norwegian international has also displayed a remarkable form for his club’s domestic fixtures, with the youngster scoring 12 goals in 11 appearances as well as 4 assists. The striker also managed to score 4 goals in 2 outings in the Austrian Cup competition.</p>
      <p>The summer transfer window will see the Salzburg striker negotiate a move away from the Austrian club as interested European giants lineup to land the teenager. Manchester United, Juventus and Bayern Munich, along with Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid are all rightfully interested in the talented striker.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old could be a great signing for the Spanish club as he could be a long term replacement for the aging Luis Suarez.</p>

      <h4>Harry Kane</h4>
      <p>With the recent appointment of Jose Mourinho after the sacking of Mauricio Pochettino, Harry Kane has displayed his love for the former manager and many speculate that this can result in the eventual departure of the player from the club.</p>
      <p>Former Barca striker, David Villa, has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/harry-kane-best-striker-world-no-need-leave-tottenham-believes-david-villa-11189497/"><b>named</b></a> the Englishman as the best striker in football, stating “He is the best striker, or No 9, in football right now, He is great in almost everything he does, he is one of the candidates for taking the golden boot at Euro 2020 for sure.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.footballfancast.com/premier-league/tottenham/spurs-reportedly-name-price-for-harry-kane"><b>Reports</b></a> have claimed Spurs are willing to sell the striker amid Real Madrid interest,  demanding 120 million euros for the forward. Harry Kane can be a great addition to Blaugrana as the English skipper has proven to be a talented goalscorer.</p>

      <h4>Jose Juan Macias</h4>
      <p>Mexican star goalscorer, Jose Marcias, is another young prospect Barcelona can look to invest. The 19-year-old has already <a href="https://tribuna.com/en/fcbarcelona/news/3424957/"><b>revealed</b></a> Barca as his dream club.</p>
      <p>“Barcelona are the team I watch the most, I know that for many it is boring, but I like to analyze them,” an interview with Marca.</p>
      <p>The striker is highly praised in Mexico as he leads the attack for the nation’s U20 squad. He has scored 8 goals in 17 appearances this season for his Liga MX side, Club León, and is ready to play for the European giants.</p>
      <p>Which of these Strikers would you like to see at Barcelona?</p>
