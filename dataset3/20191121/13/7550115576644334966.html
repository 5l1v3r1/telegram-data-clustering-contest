        <b>Before arriving at Liverpool last summer <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> had a host of high-profile clubs approach him, but a meeting with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> convinced him to join.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After a slow start last season, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> has established himself as one of the Reds’ most important players, and one of the names guaranteed in Klopp’s first-choice lineup.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian is in the top five for minutes played this season, and netted his first goal of the campaign to open the scoring in the 3-1 win over <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Man City</a> last time out.</p>
      <p>But were it not for Klopp, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> could have been playing for City instead, as the midfielder’s brother-in-law Ricardo Assis revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/making-fabinho-counting-birds-jose-mourinhos-hotel-visit-jurgen/">the <i>Telegraph</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/man-city">Manchester City</a> and Juventus also talked to his agent, but it was Liverpool that made all the effort to sign him,” Assis said.</p>
      <p>“Klopp showed him videos of the team, explained why he wanted to sign him.</p>
      <p>“But he also made it clear that it wouldn’t be straightforward for him to be a regular starter from the beginning.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> left the meeting determined to join Liverpool.”</p>

      <p>The 26-year-old has previously attested to the influence of <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/philippe-coutinho/">Philippe Coutinho</a> in persuading him Anfield was the right destination, with the latter “talking about the exceptional Liverpool fans.”</p>
      <p>He is not the first player to have been sold on the club by Klopp’s enthusiasm, either, with <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/georginio-wijnaldum/">Gini Wijnaldum</a> among those to turn down advances from other sides to join the Reds.</p>
      <p>“I had great conversations with [Mauricio] Pochettino and Klopp,” he told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/25/georginio-wijnaldum-interview-liverpool-klopp-newcastle-holland">the <i>Guardian</i></a> in 2016.</p>
      <p>“But in the meeting with Jurgen we had a laugh and did not speak only about football.”</p>
      <p>Like <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>, Wijnaldum also recalled how the manager “explained his way of playing and said that I would fit in,” with his attention to detail ensuring he was “very excited” to join.</p>

      <p>It is also interesting that Klopp had already told <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> prior to joining that his transition into the starting XI would be a slow one.</p>
      <p>The No. 3 was no doubt frustrated sitting on the bench in his first months at the club, but will have grown to understand why he, like <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/andrew-robertson/">Andy Robertson</a> and <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alex-oxlade-chamberlain/">Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a>, was given time to adjust.</p>
      <p>The <i>Telegraph</i> also detail how while at Monaco, <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> had attempted to negotiate a clause in his contract that stipulated right-back as his “mandatory position.”</p>
      <p>In an alternate reality, Liverpool may still not have solved their defensive midfield issue—but fortunately the lure of working under Klopp did just that.</p>
