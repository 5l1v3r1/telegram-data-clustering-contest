      <p>Organizers of Kelowna's annual RibFest have come out in support of their title sponsor following a <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/270705/animal-activists-arrested">staged protest </a>by animal rights activists earlier this week.</p>
      <p>"We thank Interior Savings for their support of our RibFest event over the past four years," said RibFest organizer Chris Murphy with the Rotary Club of Kelowna - Sunrise.</p>
      <p>"With their help, and the help of every visitor to the event, we raise funds that benefit our community. We return tens of thousands of dollars to local causes, including over $40,000 to JoeAnna's House, and thousands of dollars to other Kelowna organizers like Freedom's Door, Food for Thought and Pathways Abilities."</p>
      <p>A handful of environmental and animal activists chained themselves outside the Bernard Avenue branch of Interior Savings Credit Union Monday morning, protesting the financial institution's role in RibFest.</p>
      <p>They said animal agriculture contributes to climate change, and showcased videos claiming to show animal abuse at Excelsior Hog farm in Abbotsford. The group raided the farm in the summer.</p>
      <p>"By sponsoring Ribfest, Interior Savings is paying for these animal atrocities to take place," the group said.</p>
      <p>Those who chained themselves outside the front doors, preventing the bank from opening, were eventually arrested.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Murphy says RibFest raised more than $78,000 for charities this year.</p>
