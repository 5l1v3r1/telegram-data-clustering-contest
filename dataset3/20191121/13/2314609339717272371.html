      <h1>'Made a mistake?': Sam Neill to receive AACTA's 'highest screen accolade'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Karl Quinn</a></address>
      <p>When Sam Neill first stepped in front of a camera on a movie set he had no idea he was launching a career that would span five decades and take him around the world.</p>
      <p>"It was slim pickings in those days," he says of his starring role in Roger Donaldson's 1977 thriller <i>Sleeping Dogs</i>, the first feature film that had been made in New Zealand in more than 20 years.</p>
      <p>"I didn’t think about having a career as an actor, let alone in films. I'd heard of one or two New Zealand actors working abroad, perhaps at the Royal Shakespeare Company or in Melbourne, but I'd never heard of another New Zealander in the movies, so it wasn't something I thought about. It wasn't until I came to Australia and Margaret Fink and Gillian Armstrong put me in <i>My Brilliant Career</i> [in 1979] that I thought, 'Wait a minute – I'm enjoying this; maybe I could do it as a living'."</p>

      <p>That living now amounts to more than 130 credits in film and television, including the <i>Jurassic Park</i> franchise, a handful of Emmy and Golden Globe nominations, a best actor Logie for <i>Jessica</i> in 2005, and an AFI award as best actor for his role as Michael Chamberlain in Fred Schepisi's <i>Evil Angels</i> in 1989.</p>
      <p>And on December 4, he'll have another one for the mantelpiece, as he is presented with AACTA's Longford Lyell Award for outstanding contribution to the Australian screen industry, described by the academy as "Australia's highest screen accolade".</p>

      <p>"It's very nice of people to think of one at all, let alone to give you an award for hanging around long enough," the 72-year-old actor, producer and winemaker says. "You might want to call them and see if they've made a mistake, though, given I'm a New Zealander."</p>
      <p>Neill in fact started out as a director of documentaries, dabbling in his spare time in acting roles in short films being made by friends. In recent years, he's returned to the documentary format, producing and presenting <i>Why Anzac With Sam Neill</i> in 2015 and the six-part series <i>The Pacific: In the Wake of Captain Cook</i> last year.</p>
      <p>This last was a massive undertaking that kept him away from acting for a year, but he's keen to do it again. "It was a real blast, an eye-opener and a great voyage of discovery for me," he says of the series that retraced the journeys of Cook and examined the lasting impact thereof. "I'm completely fascinated by the Pacific, and there's so much more to do there."</p>
      <p>But he has absolutely no desire to be the person calling the shots again. "Directing is such hard work and I'm fundamentally a lazy person, so I'm happy for someone else to carry that burden."</p>
      <p>The award comes at an interesting time for the local film and television industry, Neill notes. "We're in a very interesting period of flux," he says, referring to the proliferation of streaming platforms, the challenges to the free-to-air and subscription TV models, and the threat posed to the movie theatre business.</p>
      <p>He remains "a great advocate for cinema", he says. "Watching <i>Ride Like a Girl</i> with an audience, there's no substitute for that."</p>

      <p>And he's an advocate too for creatives who've been lured overseas remaining loyal to their roots, and giving back whenever they can.</p>
      <p>"Hollywood is a great drain of talent, and I do encourage that talent to come back from time to time and reinvest in Australian cinema," he says.</p>
      <p>"It's very important for any country that it has its own culture, its own painters and poets and filmmakers and actors. No country is worth a damn without its own culture."</p>
