          <b>THIS Christmas-obsessed mum has already splashed out £2,500 on gifts for each of her three kids - having started shopping on Boxing Day.</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Nurse Stacey Rosewarne, from Taunton, Somerset, plans to buy 100 presents for each of them - and reckons she'll have spent £4,000 in total come December 25.</p>

      <p>The 38-year-old will lavish kids Amber, 13, Jacob, seven, and Ebony, six, with Nike Air trainers and GHD straighteners.</p>
      <p>Stacey's also wrapped up designer gear like a North Face coat, two Adidas tracksuits and T-shirts and leggings from Nike, as well as a studio mirror with backlight and a gold chain.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to Fabulous Digital, she said: “I am a bit worried about my children not being able to fit the presents in their bedrooms, but we usually have a clear out before Christmas to help.</p>
      <p>“My sister thinks I go over the top - she does enjoy Christmas but believes there is a limit to buying presents.</p>

      <p>“My partner Darren, 40, says I’m spoilt because he had a different upbringing to me, he only got five presents.</p>
      <p>“Luckily when I was younger we were in a more fortunate position - my mum worked so hard and overcompensated at Christmas time because we didn’t see her as much.</p>
      <blockquote>I know I spoil my children and some might not have the same idea as me<cite>Stacey Rosewarne38</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“I know I spoil my children and some might not have the same idea as me but I’m following my mum’s tradition and I always remember Christmas as a time to spend with family opening presents.</p>
      <p>“My mum blames herself because she worked too much, Christmas was the only time of year that she would get to properly spend time with us.</p>
      <p>“I work really hard to buy these presents for my family and find present buying really exciting.”</p>

      <p>As well as her own kids, Stacey splashes out on Darren, his two kids, her sister, nieces and nephews.</p>
      <p>Darren earns £32,000 for his job in waste management and Stacey admits they do spoil the kids - but says it's their choice what to spend their hard earned cash on.</p>

      <p>She said: “Everyone’s entitled to their own opinions, but surely as I earn my own money, I’m allowed to spend it as I please.</p>
      <p>“I try to give my children everything I saw my mum struggle to get me and my sister.</p>
      <p>“For me, it’s all about watching my children open their gifts and seeing<br/>their reaction.”</p>

      <p>The Christmas mad mum puts cash away in her present fund every month, and scours for bargains on Facebook money saving groups.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’m obsessed with Christmas and I talk about it all the time, I love going round the shops to get my Christmas fix.</p>
      <p>“As soon as my birthday in June is over I’m all about Christmas - if I could put my tree up in September, I would!</p>
      <p>“It’s a lot harder to shop for presents nowadays because children want more expensive things – I wouldn’t be able to do it if I didn’t budget.</p>
      <blockquote>I am a bit worried about my children not being able to fit the presents in their bedrooms<cite>Stacey Rosewarne38</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“I have savings allocated to buying Christmas presents and I use groups like Ashley Money Savers to find bargains online, or I go to the shops when I know there’s a sale on.</p>
      <p>“My biggest challenge this year has been trying to find my eldest daughter Amber presents because she wants more technology and branded things which are quite expensive - I can’t get her the latest Barbie anymore.</p>
      <p>“I do think that there is so much pressure on children to have the latest things these days.”</p>

      <p>Stacey keeps her mountains of presents in the spare room in her three-bed house, until she has time to wrap them.</p>
      <p>She said: “The presents are all stored in my spare room under the bed and I live in a three bedroom house where there’s not many places to keep them.</p>
      <p>“One time I drove around with a big sloth teddy in the boot for weeks because there was nowhere to hide it in the house.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes I’ve accidentally bought the same thing twice and I don’t know about it until I get round to wrapping them all up.”</p>

      <p>Stacey will continue shopping for this year until Christmas Eve, before starting the whole process again in the Boxing Day sales.</p>
      <p>And if any presents aren't getting used, she tries to re-gift them to less fortunate families.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve found a few presents I got for Ebony last year that haven’t been out of their cellophane, so I plan on re-gifting these on an internet site for families in less fortunate situations.”</p>
      <p>Yesterday a busy single mum revealed she dresses her son, four, while he’s still sleeping and VACUUMS dirt off his socks instead of washing them.</p>
