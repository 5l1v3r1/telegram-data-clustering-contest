      <p>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Court records show a <a href="https://wsvn.com/news/local/forklift-operator-arrested-after-fatal-hit-and-run-crash-with-car-in-fort-lauderdale/">forklift operator who was involved in a fatal crash</a> in South Florida had been fined three times for driving without a license since 2011.</p>
      <p>The South Florida SunSentinel reports Ulises Mondragon told police he didn’t have a driver’s license nor a permit to operate heavy machinery like the forklift that collided with a Mercedes-Benz convertible and killed 70-year-old James Zako.</p>
      <p>The crash happened Saturday near Fort Lauderdale. A police report says Mondragon continued driving to a nearby construction site.</p>
      <p>Mondragon is jailed on multiple charges including leaving the scene of a fatal crash.</p>
      <p>Court records show Mondragon is from El Salvador and doesn’t have legal documentation to be in the United States. Authorities have placed an immigration hold on him.</p>
