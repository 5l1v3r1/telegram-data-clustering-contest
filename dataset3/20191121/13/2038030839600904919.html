      <p>London - A lawyer for some of the alleged victims of Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday said they wanted to speak to Prince Andrew about his links to the late convicted sex offender.</p>
      <p>Queen Elizabeth II's second son, 59, has faced outrage for days after he gave a <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/watch-prince-andrew-denies-sexual-allegations-in-explosive-interview-20191118"><b>television interview</b></a> in which he defended his friendship with the disgraced financier.</p>
      <p>The prince is accused of having had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured by Epstein, who was found dead in a New York prison in August.</p>
      <p>Andrew denies the allegations.</p>
      <p>But on WednesdayÂ <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/prince-andrew-will-step-back-from-public-duties-amid-ongoing-sexual-misconduct-scandal-20191120"><b>he said he was stepping down from public duties</b></a> because the outcry was causing "major disruption" to the royal family and the charities and organisations associated with it.</p>
      <p>He said he was "willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required".</p>

      <p>US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents five women allegedly assaulted by Epstein, told BBC radio that Andrew should speak to everyone probing the allegations - including her.</p>
      <p>"All of the staff who work for Prince Andrew should come and give information and evidence and the documents should be turned over - emails, texts, calendars, phone logs, travel logs - so we can get to the bottom of this," she said.</p>
      <p>Bloom did not rule out approaching the prince directly to secure a sworn statement.</p>
      <p>"We believe that nobody is above the law and that everybody should have to answer questions if they have relevant information - and he clearly does have relevant information."</p>
      <p>Since the interview, Andrew has been accused of failing to show sympathy for Epstein's victims, prompting companies and organisations to reassess their ties with the royal.</p>
      <p>Some institutions supporting business initiatives championed by the prince have either failed to renew their support or said it was under review.</p>
      <p>Others have faced calls for <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/Royal-News/students-at-top-university-call-for-prince-andrew-to-step-down-in-wake-of-sexual-misconduct-scandal-20191120"><b>Andrew to be dropped as patron</b></a>.</p>
