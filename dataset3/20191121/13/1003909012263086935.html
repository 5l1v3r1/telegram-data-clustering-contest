      <h1>Review: Vertigo's newest Sherlock Holmes case an elementary mystery</h1>

      <p>Vertigo Theatre has given Sherlock Holmes and the Raven’s Curse a handsome world premiere production.</p>
      <p>Technically it’s a dream production with Narda McCarroll’s intricate and highly functional set design and a mood-setting lighting design. Beth Kates’ projections are the finishing touch that allows the action to move swiftly, effortlessly and pleasingly from a Scottish moor to a London men’s club and then through several streets to Holmes’ apartment at 221b Baker Street and that’s only the first act.</p>
      <p>For the second act, McCarroll and Kates follow Holmes to a train station, into a train compartment and into Holmes’ uncle’s manor house on the Isle of Skye and back to the ruins on the moor the audience first visited at the top of the play.</p>
      <p>Such location hopping is the basis of screenplays but is far more difficult to accomplish effectively on stage, yet these kinds of plays have become a staple at Vertigo whose production teams serve it up with real pizzazz. Adding to the authentic look and feel of Victorian England are Leslie Robison-Green’s costumes, Derek Paulich’s sets and Andrew Blizzard’s sound effects and original music design.</p>
      <p>As we saw with Sherlock Holmes and the American Problem, R. Hamilton Wright’s earlier play at Vertigo, this actor-turned-playwright has a witty, self-referential style and a knack for creating amusing supporting characters and he certainly knows Holmes’ lore. What Wright needs though is a ripping good mystery for Holmes to solve, which is not the case with either American Problem or Raven’s Curse.</p>
      <p>The real momentum in Raven’s Curse comes courtesy of the fevered performances of the outstanding cast and Jenna Rodgers’ vigorous staging, not in Wright’s caper.</p>
      <p>In Raven’s Curse, Sherlock’s cousin Beatrice (Katherine Fadum) informs him that her father has died, leaving him a portion of the family estate. Sherlock is convinced there is something suspicious, not only with his uncle’s death, but with cousin Beatrice’s reaction to it and to the wording of the will.</p>
      <p>This case reunites Sherlock with his favourite cousin Fiona (Rong Fu), the adopted Chinese daughter of Sir Donald and with Dr. Watson (Curt McKinstry), Sherlock’s landlady Mrs. Hudson (Kathryn Kerbes) and Sherlock’s brother Mycroft (Garett Ross). They are all delightful eccentrics.</p>
      <p>This play has given Braden Griffiths, who returns as Sherlock, ample opportunity to be wildly extravagant and Griffiths fleshes out all the physical ticks and vocal antics he gave Sherlock last time around.</p>
      <p>The revelation in Raven’s Curse is in Watson, both as written by Wright and inhabited by McKinstry.</p>
      <p>When we meet Watson, he is still mourning the death of his wife six months earlier so he is not the amiable, supportive sidekick he was in American Problem. When Sherlock asks him to pose as a manservant and spy on the family members at Skye, McKinstry is hilarious. It’s the play’s most winning performance.</p>
      <p>It turns out cousin Fiona is Sherlock’s match as a problem-solver so together they try to solve the riddle in Sir Donald’s will. It would have been so much more fun had that portion of the will been projected on the set so the audience could have tried to solve it as well.</p>
      <p>A problem with Vertigo’s production is that Wright’s play requires 12 characters, which results in double casting by most of the supporting actors. At the top of the second act when the actors have simply changed wigs and costumes, it’s initially confusing. Raven’s Curse will be a popular play to mount for community and college theatre groups which aren’t worried about salaries and won’t have to double cast.</p>
      <p>Raven’s Curse is spirited fun even if it isn’t much of a head scratcher.</p>
      <p>It runs until Dec. 14.</p>
