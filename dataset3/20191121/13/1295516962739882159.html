      <p>David Harbour, who starred in Neil Marshall's <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/hellboy-film/">Hellboy</a></i> reboot, isn't afraid to take shots at the film's poor box office performance.</p>
      <p>Harbour granted <i>Architectural Diges</i>t a tour of his home and stopped to discuss his poster for the live-action <i>Masters of the Universe</i> film starring Dolph Lundgren and Frank Langella, referring to it as "one of his most prized possessions. It has Frank Langella in a ton of prosthetics as Skeletor. I heard him interviewed where he considers it one of his greatest roles of all time and I just like the fact that a really great actor that I admire could do a film in full prosthetics that wasn't received very well."</p>

      <p>In June, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/hellboy-harbour-no-sequel-in-works/">Harbour confirmed</a> there were no plans for a sequel to the <i>Hellboy</i> reboot, saying, "There's a lot of people who reach out to me who really loved it and really enjoyed the new take, and were just happy to see him back on the screen, but I know in the culture at large, I don't think it was very well received."</p>
      <p>Harbour's next big-screen outing is Marvel Studios' <i>Black Widow</i>. Directed by Cate Shortland, the film also stars Scarlett Johansson,  Florence Pugh, O-T Fagbenle and Rachel Weisz and arrives in theaters on May 1, 2020.</p>
