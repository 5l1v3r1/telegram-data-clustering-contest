        <b>A video of Nigerian singer David Adeleke aka Davido is currently making the rounds on social media, as the singer celebrates his 27th birthday ceremony.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng </b>sighted the hilarious video posted on the official Instagram page of Davido Worldwide Music (DMW) official hypeman, Special Spesh.</p>
      <p>The clip captures the moment the celebrant was taking a dump in the toilet. From indications, he did not lock the door after he had settled to relieve himself.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately for him, his colleague used the opportunity to film him on camera and share the video on social media.</p>
      <p>In the caption that accompanied the post, Special Spesh teasingly disclosed that the post is a payback for all the times he has also shared some of his awkward recordings on social media.</p>
