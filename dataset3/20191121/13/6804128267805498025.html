      <p>Former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock has remarkably claimed that Tottenham did not improve during Mauricio Pochettino's five year spell at the club.</p>
      <p>The Argentine boss was sacked on Tuesday evening and swiftly replaced by Jose Mourinho on Wednesday morning, who is now preparing for his fourth stint in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Pochettino</a>'s departure came off the back of a woeful start to the season which has left <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> 11-points adrift of the top-four spots, facing a stern battle to secure Champions League football next season.</p>
      <p>Despite the issues this season, Pochettino earned vast praise throughout his stint in north London after turning the Lilywhites from Champions League hopefuls to finalists last season - but <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/stephen-warnock">Warnock</a> is not convinced.</p>
      <p>“He’s won nothing and he hasn’t progressed the club. People will be surprised by that but when you compare him to others, I compare him to Klopp and to Guardiola, they’re the two that everyone wants to try to emulate and be like," he told BBC Radio 5Live.</p>
      <p>“Pochettino, when he came in, had a kick. When you look at the buys he has made, I don’t think he’s brought well, and for me, the team has gotten worse than when he first joined in the first couple of years.”</p>
