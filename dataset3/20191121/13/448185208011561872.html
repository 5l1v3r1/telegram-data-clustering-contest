      <p>A teacher in Wayanad showed gruesome behavior by continuing class despite one of her students died from snakebite during the class session. Snehala, the fifth standard student aged 10 was taken to a hospital one hour after the snakebite. According to students of the government vocational higher secondary school, the girl’s leg has turned blue but the teacher resumed class saying the victim’s father would take her to the hospital for treatment.</p>
      <p>Television channels showed visuals of the dreaded classroom which has a hole near the desk where the victim was seated. She was first taken to a nearby hospital where due to improper response of the hospital staff was shifted to the Kozhikode Medical College. This shows a clear case of lapse on the part of the school authorities and the hospital she was first taken to!</p>
      <p>Wayanad district collector condemned the incident terming it ‘unfortunate’ and directed strict action against those responsible. The teacher is suspended and an official of education department is asked to submit a report soon on the allegation of the delayed medical attention. The additional district magistrate is also asked to visit the school. Meanwhile, angry locals and relatives of the victim barged into the school staff room and tried attacking the teachers. They were deterred by police personnel keeping a vigil in the school.</p>
