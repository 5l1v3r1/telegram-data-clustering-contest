      <h1>Bolivian president presents law allowing fresh elections</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:59:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:59</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Bolivia's interim President Jeanine Anez asked Congress on Wednesday to approve a law that would allow for new elections, after deadly unrest following the resignation of Evo Morales and the disputed October 20 ballot.</p>
      <p>The announcement comes after the number of people killed in clashes with security forces at a fuel plant near La Paz on Tuesday rose to eight, officials said, taking the total death toll since last month’s vote to 32.</p>
      <p>Morales, who fled to Mexico after resigning November 10, accused the Bolivian security forces of engaging in “genocide” against his indigenous supporters and called for action by the international community.</p>
      <p>The government earlier released an audio recording of a person it alleged to be Morales ordering a member of the opposition movement to continue road blockades around the landlocked country.</p>
      <p>For weeks his supporters have been obstructing main roads leading from agricultural regions to La Paz and other major cities, causing severe food and fuel shortages.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Anez said she hoped the caretaker government’s proposal – which also seeks the annulment of the original ballot and the formation of a new election tribunal – would form the basis for generating “a national consensus”.</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Alvaro Coimbra said the hope was for Congress to approve the law “as soon as possible”, to allow the selection within 15 days of a new election tribunal, which would be responsible for choosing a date for the ballot.</p>
      <p>A similar proposal put forward by Morales’ Movement for Socialism (MAS) party has been sent to a Senate commission for analysis.</p>
      <p>Anez still has the option to issue a presidential decree for a new vote.</p>
      <p>The Washington-based Organisation of American States, which audited last month’s elections and found irregularities, on Wednesday, approved a resolution calling on Bolivia to “urgently” hold a new vote.</p>
      <p>Unrest in Bolivia first erupted after Morales – the country’s first indigenous president – was accused of rigging the results of last month’s polls to gain re-election.</p>
      <p>He resigned and fled to Mexico after losing the support of the security forces.</p>
      <p>Anez, the 52-year-old former deputy speaker of the Senate, declared herself the country’s interim president last week, filling a vacuum left by Morales’ departure and the resignations of several ministers.</p>
      <p>Since Morales stepped down, his supporters have demonstrated daily in the streets of La Paz and in some provincial cities to demand Anez’s departure.</p>
      <p>The UN, the EU and the influential Catholic Church have been trying to broker talks between Anez’s interim government and opposition parties loyal to Morales to end the violence.</p>
      <p>Interior Minister Arturo Murillo played a telephone recording to journalists on Wednesday, allegedly of Morales issuing instructions to a leader of the opposition movement in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>“Don’t let food into the cities. We’re going to block, really encircle [the cities],” says the voice Murillo attributed to Morales.</p>
      <p>Morales’ order was a “crime against humanity,” Murillo told reporters, accusing the former president of “terrorism”.</p>
      <p>“In the coming hours we will file an international lawsuit on this,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>’Deadly violence’</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Mexico on Wednesday, Morales urged the international community to intervene to stop what he called a “genocide” in Bolivia.</p>
      <p>“This massacre . . . is part of a genocide that is happening in our beloved Bolivia,” Morales told a press conference in Mexico City.</p>
      <p>The deadliest clashes occurred last Friday in the central city of Cochabamba – a stronghold for Morales – where nine people were killed in a confrontation with the army and police.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, deadly violence erupted in El Alto when security forces lifted a siege on a fuel plant that had caused severe shortages in the nearby capital.</p>
      <p>The attorney general’s office said eight people died in those clashes. The initial death toll had been three, with dozens more wounded.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the ombudsman’s office said earlier two of those killed had been hit by gunfire.</p>
      <p>The army said in a statement that “agitators and vandals” had attacked and partially destroyed the Senkata fuel plant “using high-powered explosives”.</p>
      <p>A convoy of around 50 fuel tankers was able to leave the Senkata plant for the first time in more than a week after police and military forces using armoured vehicles secured the route to neighbouring La Paz.</p>
      <p>The defence ministry issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that protesters had surrounded the plant again and security forces were protecting it to avoid “any type of attack”.</p>
      <p>Morales supporters erected barricades around the El Alto plant last week to protest what they said was a coup by Anez.</p>
