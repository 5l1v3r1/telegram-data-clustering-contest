      <p>"Every attempt to intimidate the leaders of the opposition will be a matter of concern in Europe ", - said the President of the European Council at the press conference in Zagreb while commenting on Ukraine’s tape scandal, in which the Head of Office of the President instructs the Director of State Bureau of Investigations how to carry on the case regarding the fifth president Poroshenko. - "I hope that Ukraine will remain a country where law enforcement and judiciary respect the rule of law and there is no place for politically motivated prosecutions".</p>
      <p>Tusk, who has been just yesterday elected to lead the European People’s Party, also stated that he had heard of the tape scandal in Kyiv: "I have heard about this potential scandal. I have no information about details and I am not aware of the overall context of the situation but my first impression is that this is something really dangerous".</p>
      <p>Donald Tusk, whose party is in opposition in Poland, declared that he personally knows what political prosecution is. "Trust me I have something... I know what I am talking about with my personal experience. Always when political power and people in power use judiciary system against political opponents it means in any way in mid- or long-term perspective a tragedy not only for the victims of this method but for the country".</p>
      <p>Tusk, who has been advocating for Ukraine in the EU for over these 5 years, also added that he follows after the developments in Kyiv: "You know how much emotions and thoughts we have invested in Ukraine. I believe that I should not explain how, personally myself, I have cared about everything that was going on in Ukraine. We will always be following very attentively after developments in Kyiv".</p>
