      <h1>Biggest Bull Is Preparing for Bitcoin to Skyrocket Despite Recent Crash</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin’s price action has been bearish as of late.</li>
        <li>Nevertheless, the biggest bull in Crypto Twitter sees a reversal in the horizon.</li>
        <li>Other traders do not share an optimistic outlook and bet on a bitcoin plummet to $6,000 levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To say that crypto enthusiasts have turned bearish on bitcoin would be an understatement. The number one cryptocurrency is now trading below $8,000. The chart looks ugly and it gives very little reason to be bullish.</p>

      <p>The cryptocurrency has been in a slow bleed ever since it climbed as high as $10,350 on Oct. 26. At that point, many thought that bitcoin would restart its bullish trend. Unfortunately, long positions got liquidated as the digital asset dumped.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/crypto-twitters-biggest-bull-predicts-bitcoin-12000/">Crypto Twitter’s biggest bull</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/majinsayan">Majin</a> strongly believes that the dominant cryptocurrency is primed for a reversal. The liquidity game theorist claims that bitcoin is bottoming out.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin in the Process of Reaccumulation</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin has been painful to watch over the last few weeks. The cryptocurrency lost all bullish steam while volatility was being slowly sucked out of the window. This is often a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distribution-stock.asp">sign of distribution</a> where the smart money investors gradually take profits.</p>
      <p>Majin, however, sees the exact opposite. The trader believes that the smart money investors are accumulating BTC in preparation for the next leg up. The analyst told CCN,</p>
      <blockquote>I interpret the entire $7,400 and $10,00 range as reaccumulation. So the short-squeeze went to the top of the range.</blockquote>
      <p>The short squeeze that the trader’s referring to is the move above $10,000 on Oct. 26. Majin added,</p>
      <blockquote>The slow-bleed since has been reaccumulation, absorption of supply, and preparation of a new rally. I expect [bitcoin] to start drifting up from here.</blockquote>

      <p>Majin’s analysis came with bitcoin’s weekly chart. The chart shows that the cryptocurrency is still respecting the uptrend line with declining volume. The analyst added,</p>
      <blockquote>Especially note the receding weekly volume as price is moving down the range on the last four candles.</blockquote>
      <p>When asked what level would invalidate the analysis, Majin replied,</p>
      <blockquote>[Bitcoin] price below $7,800 but I expect it to have already bottomed.</blockquote>
      <h3>Other Prominent Traders Do Not Share Majin’s Optimism</h3>
      <p>I scoured Crypto Twitter (CT) and it appears that Majin is the only one to have a rosy outlook on bitcoin. Many are expecting a substantial drop to $6,000 levels. For instance, popular Elliottician Benjamin Blunts predicts a bitcoin dump to $6,500. At that point, it might muster the strength to reverse its trend.</p>

      <p>Trader Escobar sees a similar scenario playing out. The trader forecasts a plunge to $6,800 before the top cryptocurrency can show signs of recovery.</p>

      <p>It’s not surprising that many traders are expecting a drop to $6,000. After all, <a href="https://www.ccn.com/3-reasons-bitcoin-price-will-sprint-beyond-2019-high-6000/">$6,000 is a psychological level for bitcoin</a>.</p>
      <p>A dump to $6,500 would mean that bitcoin lost over 53% of its value from the 2019 top of $13,880. Even for the number one cryptocurrency, that would be an extreme retracement.</p>
      <p>Trader Rekt conducted an in-depth study of the bitcoin halvings. He discovered that the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/bitcoin-halving-everything-you-need-to-know-4573dc5b528e">cryptocurrency would go on a pre-halving retracement</a> that wipes out between 38% and 50% of its value.</p>
      <p>Thus, the 47% drop to the Oct. 23 low of $7,293 is very likely the bottom of this pullback. I am one with Majin, and I believe that a bullish reversal is incoming.</p>
