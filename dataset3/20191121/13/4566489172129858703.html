      <h1>UK Labour makes radical election pitch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:00:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alice RITCHIE (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Britain's main opposition Labour party on Thursday unveiled its general election manifesto, promising a radical agenda for social change, including nationalising key industries and a controversial second referendum on Brexit.</p>
      <p>Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called it "the most radical and ambitious plan to transform our country in decades" and a "once-in-a-generation chance of real change".</p>
      <p>Key pledges included the nationalisation of the rail, water, energy and broadband networks, in addition to huge investment in public services, corporate reforms and the introduction of a 32-hour working week.</p>
      <p>Labour has promised a "green industrial revolution" to tackle what Corbyn called "the climate emergency", by focusing new jobs and industries on efforts to tackle global warming.</p>
      <p>But the most immediate problem is Brexit, with Britain due to leave the European Union on January 31 -- just weeks after the December 12 poll.</p>
      <p>Labour says that within six months of taking office, it will strike a new exit deal with the European Union and hold a second referendum on Britain's membership.</p>
      <p>"The British people have the final say. Our government will carry it out, whatever the result of that vote is," Corbyn told an audience of party activists and media.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls show Labour trailing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives, and many activists admit that perceived ambiguity on Brexit is harming the party.</p>
      <p>But Corbyn is hoping to galvanise voters like he did in the last election in 2017 by focusing on tackling inequality after nine years of Conservative austerity measures.</p>
      <p>At the manifesto launch in Birmingham, central England, he said the programme was "full of popular policies that the political establishment has blocked for a generation".</p>
      <p>He repeated the attacks on the rich and powerful that have been a feature of Labour's campaign so far, saying: "It's time for real change."</p>
      <p>- 'Reckless spending spree' -</p>
      <p>The manifesto includes big-ticket promises such as a five percent pay rise for public sector workers and the abolition of university tuition fees.</p>
      <p>Corbyn said Labour would bring back into public ownership the "obvious monopolies", which includes parts of telecoms giant BT to provide free broadband for all.</p>
      <p>The party envisages a huge increase in borrowing to fund investment, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think-tank had previously estimated at around £55 billion ($71 billion, 64 billion euros) a year.</p>
      <p>Labour has also promised tax rises for the top five percent of earners, a rise in corporation tax, and levies on oil companies and multinationals.</p>
      <p>Johnson's Conservatives were quick to condemn the plans for being "a reckless spending spree which would take a sledgehammer to the British economy".</p>
      <p>The head of the British Chambers of Commerce said firms would welcome plans to upgrade infrastructure, as well as Labour's open approach to migration.</p>
      <p>"But command and control isn't the way," said Adam Marshall. "Excessive intervention in business governance and sweeping tax rises would suppress innovation and smother growth."</p>
      <p>Corbyn said he expected hostility from business groups, political rivals and a predominantly right-wing media because "the system is working just fine for them".</p>
      <p>"It's rigged in their favour -- but it's not working for you," he told the audience.</p>
      <p>Labour wants to put workers on company boards and introduce pay ratios within firms, invest in transport and build 100,000 social homes a year.</p>
      <p>- 'Get Brexit Done' -</p>
      <p>Johnson has yet to unveil his own manifesto, which is expected at the weekend, but has also promised big increases in public spending -- although not on the same scale as Labour.</p>
      <p>Ahead of Labour's launch he announced a cut in salary taxes and also vowed a huge house-building programme.</p>
      <p>But after Britain's EU exit was delayed three times under him and his predecessor, Johnson's focus in the election is on delivering the next Brexit deadline of January 31.</p>
      <p>Corbyn said his plan for a second EU referendum was a responsible approach but Johnson said re-running the divisive 2016 vote would only offer more delays.</p>
      <p>"It's only because we will get Brexit done and end the uncertainty that we can afford to cut taxes for hard-working taxpayers," he said.</p>
      <p>But official data Thursday showed British state borrowing hit £11.2 billion ($14.5 billion, 13.1 billion euros) last month, the highest October figure for five years.</p>
      <p>"The worst October for the public finances for five years won't prevent whoever wins the election embarking on a fiscal splurge," said Andrew Wishart, economist at research group Capital Economics.</p>
