      <h1>Euro 2020 finals draw: what date is it, which teams have qualified and how to watch live   </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:09:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/angus-williams/" target="_blank">Angus Williams</a></address>
      <h3>What is happening?</h3>
      <p>The draw for the group stage of the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/euro-2020/">Euro 2020 tournament. </a></p>
      <h3>When and where is it?</h3>
      <p>Saturday 30 November in Bucharest, Romania.</p>
      <h3>What time does it start?</h3>
      <p>The draw kicks off at 18:00 CET. That’s 5pm GMT.</p>
      <h3>How can I watch it?</h3>
      <p>This is as of yet unconfirmed, but you will be able to follow live with <i>Telegraph Sport.</i></p>
      <h3>Who has qualified?</h3>
      <p>The qualifiers will be the top two teams from the ten qualifying groups, and then four winners of the play-offs which will be held in March 2020. </p>
      <p>So far England, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Portugal, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, Croatia, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Austria, France, Turkey, Belgium, Russia, Italy, Finland and Wales have already confirmed their places. </p>
      <p>The teams who have qualified for the play-offs are Iceland, Bosnia, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Norway, Serbia, Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary, Romania, Geoegia, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Belarus. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/euro-2020-play-offs-explained-nations-league-route-qualification/">How these 16 teams will be whittled down to four is explained in full here</a>.  </p>
      <p>Unusually for a major tournament, none of the host nations qualify automatically. That’s because the tournament is spread across 12 different European nations with Wembley set to host the semi-finals and final.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>In order to allow all 12 teams from the host associations to have a chance to qualify as group winners and runners-up, a maximum of two were placed in each group: Azerbaijan, Denmark, England, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Republic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Spain. If both hosts qualify from a group, then a draw will be held to decide which of those two teams will be at home when they face each other.</p>
      <p>The other spots in each group will be allocated by drawing the teams out of four pots which have been seeded depending on where the teams finish in their qualifying groups. </p>
      <p>However, there are certain teams that Uefa will not let be drawn in the same group as each other if they qualify, for instance, Ukraine and Russia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, or Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.  </p>
      <h3>The pots</h3>
      <p><b>Pot 1</b> Belgium, Italy (hosts), England (hosts), Germany (hosts), Spain (hosts), Ukraine.</p>
      <p><b>Pot 2</b> France Poland, Switzerland, Croatia, Netherlands (hosts), Russia (hosts).</p>
      <p><b>Pot 3</b> Portugal, Turkey, Denmark (hosts), Austria, Sweden, Czech Republic.</p>
      <p><b>Pot 4</b> Wales, Finland, Winner play-off Path A, Winner play-off Path B, Winner play-off Path C, Winner play-off Path D.</p>
      <h3>Who could England get?</h3>
      <p>England will be in group D. They are paired with Scotland who will have to win their two match play-off in March to qualify. </p>
      <h3>Who is likely to win?</h3>
      <p>France are favourites with the bookies. England are the second favourites, with Belgium, Germany and Spain in the chasing pack.  </p>
