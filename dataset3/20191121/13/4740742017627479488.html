      <h1>Top street artist to create new artwork underneath Banksy's 'Mild Mild West' in Stokes Croft</h1>
      <h2>Hazard is known around the globe for her stunning creations</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:28:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>Bristol is renowned for its graffiti and this weekend the city will welcome another stunning new piece of artwork.</p>
      <p>Hazard, one of the top street artists in the UK, is renowned for her striking female portraits, detailed floral creations and wildlife pieces worldwide.</p>
      <p>This weekend the artist, real name Harriet Wood, will be showing off her skills outside Hamilton House in Stokes Croft, where she will be creating a new piece of work below Banksy’s 'Mild Mild West'.</p>
      <p>Hazard was initially due to create the artwork last week as part of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bristols-hamilton-house-host-jam-3488243">open studios weekend at the community hub</a>, but was ordered by a doctor to rest her hand having been involved in a painting marathon across the USA, including jobs in Arizona and New York.</p>

      <p>She said: "I was on strict orders not to do anything paint-related until my hand got better.</p>
      <p>"I hate letting people down and was really looking forward to painting during the open studios weekend at Hamilton House.</p>
      <p>"But it was just a postponement, not a cancellation, and I am looking forward to returning this weekend."</p>
      <p>Harriet told Bristol Live she is not able to reveal what she will be painting, but people are encouraged to watch the creation being brought to life.</p>
      <p>After spending several years in Barcelona Harriet is now based in Bristol - when not jetting all over the world to create her distinctive artwork, of course.</p>
      <p>In 2014 she was recognised by the Huffington Post among "25 women pushing the limits of street art around the world" and also named among the UK’s very best female graffiti artists by The Guardian.</p>

      <p>Hannah Worsley from Forward Space, which manages Hamilton House for owners Connolly &amp; Callaghan, said: "When Hazard was not able to attend the open studios event, we knew it was just a postponement, not a cancellation.</p>
      <p>"We’re all very excited to welcome her to Hamilton House this weekend. It’s fantastic for us that such a well-known artist is keen to create something here, and we can’t wait to see what she comes up with.</p>
      <p>"We know what she is planning to create, but don’t want to say anything now, we would rather people came to watch the work take shape and find out for themselves."</p>
      <p>Hazard is due to be painting from 11am on both Saturday and Sunday this weekend until late into the afternoon, depending on the weather.</p>
