      <p>UK opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn is being accused of playing up Jeffrey Epstein’s “Jewishness” after mispronouncing the dead pedophile’s name during an election debate.</p>
      <p>Corbyn’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-C_pI3PIA8&amp;feature=youtu.be">on-air flub came Tuesday</a> when he was asked about <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-in-wake-of-epstein-interview/">Prince Andrew’s disastrous interview</a> about his ties to Epstein, who committed suicide in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>“Before we discuss Prince Andrew, I think we should discuss the victims that are there because of what Epstein was doing,” Corbyn said to applause, clearly pronouncing his name “Ep-schtine.”</p>
      <p>“The primary position ought to be the proper treatment of those people that were victims of the most appalling behavior by apparently Epstein and many others,” Corbyn continued, again mispronouncing “Epstein.”</p>
      <p>The Campaign Against Antisemitism in the UK pounced on Corbyn — who was debating Prime Minister Boris Johnson — for the Epstein error and for claiming that his Labour party has investigated “every single case” of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>“Jeremy Corbyn’s risible attempt to deceive viewers about his handling of Labour’s antisemitism crisis was compounded by his bizarre and inconsistent pronunciation of the Jewish surname of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, referring to him at one point as ‘ep-shtein,'” <a href="https://antisemitism.uk/jeremy-corbyn-laughed-at-in-itv-election-debate-as-he-lied-about-labours-handling-of-its-antisemitism-crisis/">the group said in a statement.</a></p>

      <p>“Mr. Corbyn’s abhorrent record on Jews certainly raises questions as to whether the Labour leader was attempting to underscore Mr. Epstein’s Jewishness.”</p>
      <p>People on Twitter also took notice.</p>
      <p>“Every Jew watching noticed that,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Baddiel/status/1196929204417433600">tweeted</a> British comedian and novelist David Baddiel.</p>
      <p>Corbyn, a long-time supporter of Palestinian rights, and the Labour Party have been dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>The leader previously referred to terror group Hamas and Hezbollah as “friends,” while several Labour members of Parliament resigned earlier this year over Corbyn’s handling of anti-Semitism within the party.</p>
