      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southeast/florida">Florida man</a> who allegedly <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">robbed a bank</a> while donning a "Make America Great Again" shirt apparently received far more money than he demanded — and told the teller to give him a smaller amount of cash.</p>
      <p>Sandy Hawkins, 73, was arrested Tuesday following the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/robbery-theft">alleged robbery</a> that unfolded at a Wells Fargo in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/environment/cities">Boca Raton</a> around 11:30 a.m. Monday, police said.</p>

      <p>Hawkins, wearing a T-shirt that displayed his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">support for President Trump</a>, told the teller he had a weapon and said "This is a robbery," <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/florida/palm-beach-county/bank-robber-wearing-make-america-great-again-shirt-says-teller-gave-him-too-much-money">WPLG</a> reported.</p>

      <p>He demanded $1,100, and the teller counted out $2,000 in $100 bills. But Hawkins, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by the news outlet, "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/odd-news">told him it was too much</a> and again demanded $1,100."</p>
      <p>The teller then slid $1,100 through the window and Hawkins took it and left, investigators alleged.</p>

      <p>Hawkins was discovered after the manager at a nearby <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks/bars">sports bar</a> he frequented identified him. When <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Palm Beach County sheriff's deputies</a> went to his home on Tuesday, he reportedly confessed and told them, "I will make this easy."</p>
      <p>He apparently handed them a bank deposit slip that read: "Give me $1,100. Now, No Alarms, Hope to get caught."</p>

      <p>Hawkins' old landlord, Scott Vail, described the 73-year-old man <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191120/authorities-lsquoyou-gave-me-too-muchrsquo-robber-told-boca-bank-teller">to The Palm Beach Post</a> as an "affable kind of person" who "probably reached some kind of breaking point" when his wife died in 2013.</p>
      <p>Hawkins was charged with robbery and booked at the Palm Beach County jail.</p>
