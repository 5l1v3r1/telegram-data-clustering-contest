      <p>Talking to the <i>PTI </i>on October 22, Mr. Thakur had said the Himachal Pradesh cabinet would be expanded anytime after results of the Assembly bypolls were declared on October 24.</p>
      <p>The exercise is to fill two Ministerial Berths, which have been lying vacant for the past several months.</p>
      <p>Anil Sharma, who was the Power Minister in the State government, had to resign after his son contested on the Congress ticket from the Mandi Lok Sabha seat this year.</p>
      <p>Mr. Sharma had refused to campaign for the BJP candidate from Mandi, Ram Swaroop Sharma.</p>
      <p>Kishan Kapoor, who was the Dharamshala MLA and Civil Supplies Minister in the State government, had resigned after he was elected to the Lok Sabha in May from Kangra.</p>
