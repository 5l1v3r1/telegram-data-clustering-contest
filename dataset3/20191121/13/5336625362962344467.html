      <p>Skilled interviewers may spend years honing their craft, but sometimes all you really need to unlock a person's secrets is the quirky mind of a small child. Or in this case, several small children.</p>
      <p>In the BBC Radio 1 segment above, Emma Thompson follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://mashable.com/video/sarah-silverman-john-c-reilly-kids-questions/">Sarah Silverman</a> and <a href="https://mashable.com/video/tom-hardy-questions-from-kids-bbc/">Tom Hardy</a> by answering a series of "difficult questions" from kids â€” with topics ranging from the environment to what it takes to become rich.</p>
      <p>8-year-old Finn from Glasgow is even cheeky enough to ask about the best onscreen kisser Thompson has ever encountered.</p>
      <p>"Meryl Streep's a very good snogger," she responds. "I had to snog her in <i>Angels in America</i> and she was <i>method</i> about it."</p>
      <p>Goodness.</p>
