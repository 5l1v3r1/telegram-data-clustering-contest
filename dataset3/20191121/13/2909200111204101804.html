      <p>The Member Parliament (MP) for Odotobri Constituency Hon. Emmanuel Akwasi Gyamfi and District Chief Executive of Amansie Central District (DCE) Hon Asamoah Boateng are in a turf war over potholes repairs contract.</p>
      <p>Hon. Emmanuel Akwasi Gyamfi is accusing the DCE of wasting resources of the local assembly in patching potholes of roads in the district which has been neglected by successive governments when he is supposed to know that the same roads have been awarded and contractors will move to site soon.</p>
      <p>He is particularly peeved that that the deplorable roads in the area were left out in the 2020 budget reading which is set to worsen the woes of poor farmers in the wake of several complaints by farmers</p>
      <p>Residents of the district especially Cocoa farmers were not happy that the district was ignored in the budget statement by Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta</p>
      <p>“We have been deprived of good roads. Not even a single road in this district is in good state. All the roads are deplorable. Our leaders are not helping us” the farmers complained.</p>
      <p>But The Member of Parliament of Odotobri Constituency Hon Emmanuel Akwasi Gyamfi in an interview with Kumasi-based  Pured Morning Drive hosted  Kwame Adinkra revealed that majority of the roads in the district have been awarded to contracts.</p>
      <p>“Kwame, though we did not hear the district’s name in the budget but it doesn’t mean the district has been ignored. As I’m talking to you now, some major roads in the district have been awarded to contract”.</p>
      <p>“From Afoako to Jacobu road has been awarded to contract. From Asikesu to Jacobu road has also been awarded. Even some of the contractors have come to inspect the road and they are ready to come site any moment from now” The MP said.</p>
      <p>He added that “Kwame, let me take this opportunity to advice the DCE for Amansie Central District Hon Asamoah Boateng to stop wasting the district’ Common Fund to patch or repair potholes. The roads have been awarded to contractors which they are coming to site so it is unnecessary and money wasting to use the district Common Fund to patch or repair those roads”.</p>
      <p>“If the DCE does not know anything about the government measures to fix the district roads, he should ask for an explanation and clarification” He added.</p>
