      <h1>Karma Is Latest To Tease A Futuristic Electrified Truck</h1>
      <h2>The company isn't offering many details about the truck yet.</h2>

      <p>It's probably not a coincidence that Karma introduces a teaser for an upcoming plug-in hybrid electric pickup on the same day as the unveiling of Tesla's Cybertruck. The company isn't saying when this model might arrive but refers to building “proof of concept” project, which suggests this machine isn't very close to a market launch.</p>

      <p>"Extended-range powertrains represent a smart alternative to full battery systems, especially in larger vehicles used by businesses and fleets," Karma CEO Dr. Lance Zhou said in the project's announcement.</p>

      <p>The truck's design features a high beltline and steeply raked windshield. The windows have an odd design with a notch in the bottom of them. Judging by this image, the cargo bed looks tiny.</p>
      <p>In the teaser for the truck, Karma refers to this work as an Extended Range Electric Vehicle conversion project. This seems to suggest the company also intends to take existing models and install this tech into them.</p>
      <p>Karma is working on a modular platform that it calls Skateboard that be able to support electric and plug-in hybrids. While the company doesn't specify whether the truck would use these underpinnings, the firm is heavily implying it.</p>

      <p>The electrified pickup segment has the chance to become a booming market in the years to come. The Tesla Cybertruck has the opportunity to establish mainstream interest in EV trucks. <a href="https://insideevs.com/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-world-debut/">Rivian's R1T</a> should arrive in late 2020 offering over 400 miles of range and an impressive towing capacity. Ford also seems serious about entering this fight, and rumors suggest that the electric F-150 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/368920/ford-f-150-electric-2021/">could arrive as soon as 2021</a>. General Motors <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/347308/gmc-electric-pickup-announcement/">has an electric truck in the planning stages</a>, too.</p>

        <p>Karma Group Assigns Five Dedicated Business Units to Grow Business and Brand Value Beyond Retail Sales Alone<br/>Performance Oriented Revero GTS On Sale Q1 2020; SC2 Concept Previews Future Karma Design Direction<br/>Karma Demonstrates EREV Conversion Opportunities in Larger Vehicle Platforms<br/> </p>
        <p>LOS ANGELES (Nov. 19, 2019) – Karma Group, the Southern California-based high-tech mobility incubator and creator of luxury electric vehicles, used its first major North American auto show presence to showcase its technology, design and product story, during AutoMobility LA and the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show.</p>
        <p>Karma Group Builds Brand Value Beyond Retail Sales Alone</p>
        <p>“Our company is at a time of emergence where our path forward can be explained in greater detail,” said Karma CEO Dr. Lance Zhou, emphasizing that Karma is Southern California’s creator of luxury electric vehicles and the only brand building cars in this region.</p>
        <p>“However, Karma is more than just a car company,” he added. “Karma is a high-tech incubator, and a supplier to others who need our engineering, design, customization and manufacturing resources to speed their product development or make use of our ability to apply luxury touches.”</p>
        <p>Zhou used AutoMobility LA, the Los Angeles Auto Show’s annual media and industry event, to highlight Karma Group’s five dedicated business tasked with growing long-term brand value, through a combination of retail sales, partnerships, investments, and licensing its engineering, design, customization and contract manufacturing resources.</p>
        <p>Karma Group is comprised of:</p>
        <p>Karma Automotive – Creates luxury electric vehicles and builds Karma’s existing value chain.<br/>Karma Technology – Develops technology for Karma vehicles and sells its engineering expertise to others.<br/>Karma Design – Drives a clear design identity unique to Karma Automotive and sells design services to others.<br/>Karma Innovation and Customization Center – Builds Karma vehicles, grows the company’s customization capabilities and provides contract manufacturing opportunities.<br/>Karma Capital – Invests in technology companies and establishes key partnerships to help speed product development.<br/>Karma’s Path Forward = Two Platforms + Two Core Technologies + Five Tech Ecosystems</p>
        <p>“Karma’s path to future success combines two platforms with two core technologies and five intelligent ecosystems,” Zhou explained, pointing to its family of Revero vehicles as one platform, and Project e-Klipse, an all-electric global platform that will produce several different models starting in 2021 as the second.</p>
        <p>“Our two core technologies include both full-electric vehicles, BEVs, and extended range EVs, or EREVs,” Zhou said. “While we fully embrace an all-electric future, we cannot ignore the great benefits extended-range powertrains offer in parallel.”</p>
        <p>Karma’s path forward also relies on five intelligent technology ecosystems:</p>
        <p>Karma Skateboard – a modular platform for both BEV and EREV propulsion systems.<br/>Karma Cockpit – an immersive and personalized traveling environment.<br/>Karma CarNet – Securely connected vehicles with the power of 5G technology.<br/>Karma Drive – Passive, active and intelligent safety features and growing autonomous technologies<br/>Karma Cloud — Cloud computing, data integration, analytics, and artificial intelligence.<br/>“These ecosystems will be where we plant our competitive flag to achieve our business goals and establish our long-term value proposition,” Zhou explained. “We will use partnerships with startups, academia, companies, service providers, and developers who can benefit from Karma’s five technology ecosystems.”</p>
        <p>Karma’s technology-focused ecosystems are supported by fully certified products already on the road that can serve as technology test beds, a fully-operational manufacturing facility, and a complete line of engineering and design resources and key components that can be used by other OEMs and start-ups to bring their products to market faster and with less cost.</p>
        <p>Global Product Reveals</p>
        <p>To reinforce its continued commitment to it soul-stirring luxury electric vehicles, Karma unveiled two new products at AutoMobility LA — the 2020 Revero GTS, a performance version of its current 2020 Revero GT, and the SC2, a new concept car and evolution of the dramatic SC1 Vision Concept unveiled earlier this year.</p>
        <p>The GTS has a completely reengineered all-electric powertrain, and a more refined, more efficient three-cylinder range extender from BMW. Dual electric motors generate 536 HP taking this car</p>
        <p>from 0 to 60 in under four seconds with a top speed of 125 mph. Electronic torque vectoring uses the GTS’ traction motors to provide improved performance, grip, handling and stability, and delivers industry-leading wheel torque. The Revero GTS, along with the Revero GT, which is currently available for sale at Karma’s growing list of North American retail partners, is handcrafted at the $100-million-dollar Innovation &amp; Customization Center located in Moreno Valley, Calif.</p>
        <p>Featuring cutting-edge technology and design, SC2 is a bold statement to Karma’s emergence as a high-tech mobility incubator, embodying world class luxury design and Karma intellectual property. A striking full BEV concept, SC2 delivers an impressive 1100 HP and advances from 0 to 60mph in under 1.9 seconds. Front and rear mounted twin electric motors deliver 800 kW peak power, with 10,500 lb-ft wheel torque. SC2 is equipped with 350 miles of pure electric range, carbon ceramic brakes, push rod operated racing suspension and a Karma torque vectoring gearbox.</p>
        <p>Karma’s EREV Conversion Project</p>
        <p>Karma also announced its plan to demonstrate the flexibility of its EREV extended range powertrain technology through a conversion “proof of concept” project developed at its Global Headquarters in Irvine, Calif. The EREV conversion project will prove the viability of EREV systems across a wide range of vehicles beyond light-duty passenger cars and will demonstrate what Karma Technology can do for other companies.</p>
        <p>“Extended-range powertrains represent a smart alternative to full battery systems, especially in larger vehicles used by businesses and fleets,” Zhou said.</p>
        <p>Meet Karma Group and the 2020 Revero GT</p>
        <p>As our name implies, Southern California-based Karma Group is more than just a car company.
