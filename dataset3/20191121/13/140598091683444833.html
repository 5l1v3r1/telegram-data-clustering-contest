      <h1>Euro 2020 play-offs explained: the Nations League route to qualification</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:06:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/telegraph-sport/" target="_blank">Telegraph Sport</a></address>
      <p>When Uefa decided that its 55 members deserved <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/euro-2020/">a European Championship</a> finals tournament comprising 24 as opposed to 16 teams for the 2016 tournament and beyond, its initial strategy was to expand qualification in the traditional manner.</p>
      <p>Consequently the host, nine group winners and runners-up plus Turkey as the best third-placed team progressed to the finals. The final four spots were decided by play-offs between the other eight third-placed teams and the winners - Hungary, Republic of Ireland, Sweden and Ukraine - made it to France.</p>
      <h3>Already qualified</h3>
      <p>Euro 2020 has multiple hosts and, influenced by the spirit of Kraftwek’s Trans-Europ Express, will take place across 12 cities from Baku in the east to Dublin in the west. After the final round of fixtures on Nov 19 and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/aaron-ramsey-inspired-wales-secure-euro-2020-qualification-victory/">Wales' victory over Hungary in particular</a>, all 20 of the teams who qualify as group winners and runners-up have been determined: England, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Portugal, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Denmark, Croatia, Spain, Sweden, Poland, Austria, France, Turkey, Belgium, Russia, Italy, Finland and Wales. </p>
      <h3>Nations League to the rescue</h3>
      <p>That leaves four finals places up for grabs and they will be resolved between 16 of the remaining teams, split into four groups of four in which the highest-ranked team in each play-off pot hosts the fourth-ranked, and second hosts third, in one-leg semi-finals on March 26 and the winners of those matches will meet in a do-or-die final five days later.</p>
      <p>Eligibility for the play-offs is based on each country’s performance in the inaugural Nations League groups, with a qualifier from each of the four tiers: A, B, C and D. Each team that finished top of their Nations League group was guaranteed a place in the play-offs. If a team with a play-off spot had also qualified by finishing in the top two positions in their Euro 2020 qualifying group, their place goes to the next best-ranked team in their Nations League tier.</p>
      <p>So, Switzerland, Portugal, Holland and England, who won the four groups in League A, were guaranteed at least a play-off spot. Since all have now qualified for the Euro 2020 finals, their play-off spots are passed down the line, to those with the next-best record in Nations League A should they need it. If every team in League A qualifies for Euro 2020 through the usual path (and all have apart from Iceland), their play-off positions will cascade down to the best-ranked team in League B that hasn't already qualified or made the play-offs in that pathway and so on from League B to C and League C to D.</p>
      <h3>The play-off paths</h3>
      <p>Play-off groups were decided after the final round of fixtures.</p>
      <p>We know Iceland are definitely on Path A; Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on Path B and Scotland, Norway and Serbia Path C; and Georgia, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Belarus from Path D. Other teams that have also qualified are all from Path C: Bulgaria, Israel, Romania and Hungary and it is those four who are yet to learn their fate.</p>
      <p>Given there is only one open berth in Path C but three in Path A, the four unallocated teams will be drawn - three in to Path A and one into Path C - at Uefa HQ in Nyon on November 22. Only then will Scotland learn who they will be playing at Hampden on March 26 - it could be any one of Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania. All will be revealed on Friday ... </p>
