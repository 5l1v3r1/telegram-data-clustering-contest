All of these movies have earned more than 100% profits at the box office. Since, the actor has been part of controlled budget flicks, they have earned huge returns on the merit of the content and of course, the pull of Ayush’CONSISTENT’MANn.</p>

      <p>The surprising fact about the actor is that he amongst the big league superstars like Salman Khan, Akshay Kumar, Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan, to deliver back to back hits and is the only one to have 6 consecutive movies earning profit more than 100% and with highly anticipated <i>Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan</i> making all the right buzz, looks like he will only strengthen his hold at the box office.</p>
      <p>Kudos to the champ!</p>
