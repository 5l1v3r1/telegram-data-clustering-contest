      <p>The Andhra Pradesh State Anti Red Sanders Smuggling Task Force personnel on Thursday nabbed a suspected smuggling operative from Javadi Hills of Vellore district and seized an SUV carrying 23 red sanders logs at a forest location close to Alipiri bypass road, at the foot of Tirumala hills.</p>
      <p>According to the Task Force SP P. Ravi Shankar, a combing party was inspecting the forest stretch between the bypass road and Tirumala foothills, when they spotted an SUV entering the forest location after taking a diversion from the main road.</p>
      <p>Growing suspicious, the sleuths kept a watch at the area. After a half an hour, the SUV was returning to the road point, but seeing the task force men, some inmates of the vehicle fled. Rushing to the spot, the combing party nabbed one operative identified as Ezhumalai, a repeat offender. The sleuths also seized 23 logs and some provisions meant for supply to the woodcutters.</p>
      <p>The SP said that the task force received information about the presence of woodcutters in the Seshachalam forests, and additional forces would be sent inside to flush them out.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a squad of forest personnel at Bhakarapeta, the western side of Seshachalam hills, nabbed three persons, and seized meat of wild boar.</p>
