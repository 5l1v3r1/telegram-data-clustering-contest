      <h1>Six days after start of violence, EU issues Iran statement</h1>
      <h2>The protests, sparked by a hike in fuel prices, are said to have led to more than 100 deaths.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:05:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Jacopo Barigazzi</a></address>
      <p>The EU on Thursday issued a statement on the situation in Iran, six days after the start of massive protests that <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/11/iran-more-than-100-protesters-believed-to-be-killed-as-top-officials-give-green-light-to-crush-protests/">Amnesty International</a> says have resulted in more than 100 deaths.</p>
      <p>“Socio-economic challenges should be addressed through inclusive dialogue and not through the use of violence,” said a spokesperson for the External Action Service, the EU's diplomatic body, in <a href="https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/70754/statement-spokesperson-developments-iran_en">a written statement</a>. “We expect Iran's security forces to exercise maximum restraint in handling the protests and for protestors to demonstrate peacefully. Any violence is unacceptable. The rights to freedom of expression and assembly must be guaranteed.”</p>
      <p>The protests were sparked by <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/iran-petrol-gasoline-oil-price-hike-khamenei/">a hike in fuel prices</a> last Friday. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50490898">reports</a>, authorities blocked internet connections late Saturday. The EU is trying to save the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran after the U.S pulled out and its silence on the current protests has been criticized as a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/iran-petrol-gasoline-oil-price-hike-khamenei/">sign of weakness.</a></p>
      <p>The EEAS spokesperson also urged “Iranian authorities to ensure the free flow of information and access to the internet” and added “the protests in several Iranian cities over the past days have, according to reports, led to serious loss of life and left many people injured. We convey our condolences to the families of victims and wish a speedy recovery to those injured.”</p>
      <p>At the daily European Commission press briefing, a reporter asked why the statement was issued simply by a spokesperson and not by Federica Mogherini, the EU's top diplomat. An EEAS spokeswoman, Maja Kocijancic, <a href="https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-180950">rejected the criticism</a>, saying: “We use several types of statements but they all represent the EU position."</p>
      <p>Another reporter pointed at the language in the statement, saying it appeared to put the level of violence of the regime on the same level as that of the protesters. But Kocijancic denied this was the case: “Not at all, the statement is quite clear," she said. "I think the responsibility here is quite clear,” she added, referring to the Iranian authorities.</p>
