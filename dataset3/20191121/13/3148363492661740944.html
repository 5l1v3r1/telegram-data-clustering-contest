      <p>Student organizers of the event told ABC News that the campaign informed them the governor was late from a previous event and had to make a flight.</p>
      <p>The event was scheduled for Wednesday, the same night as the fifth Democrat debate hosted on NBC News.</p>
      <p>Patrick announced his decision to run for president on November 14, filing for the New Hampshire primary ballot in November.</p>
