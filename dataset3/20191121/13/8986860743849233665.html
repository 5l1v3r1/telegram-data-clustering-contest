      <p>The winner of ‘Di Asa’ 2019, Precious Mensah aka PM has finally spoken on the viral news that she was kicked off an Emirates flight to Dubai.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the embarrassing moment she suffered, PM said when she was first refused the opportunity to board the plane, she did not really take it seriously.</p>
      <p>She assumed it was just a misunderstanding that will be sorted out easily but it did not turn out that way.</p>
      <p>“At first I didn’t feel bad because I had faith everything will be okay, maybe they had their own issues,” she said in an interview with Yen.</p>
      <p>She explained that she assumed since it was her first time traveling, it was just an inconvenience that was being sorted out for her to join the flight only for the flight to leave her behind.</p>
      <p>But she added that her management is dealing with issues and she will be joining her mates soon in Dubai to have fun.</p>
      <p>“My people are working things out and very soon everything will be cleared and I will join my friends in Dubai very soon,” PM said.</p>
      <p>PM recounted how she dreamt of having the fun of her life in Dubai and even on the flight only to be disappointed.</p>
      <p>PM said: “I had really planned for the fun trip because prior to that I dreamt I was happily interacting with people in the plane.”</p>
