      <p>Exactly three weeks from today, millions of people across the UK will be voting in the General Election.</p>
      <p>Opinion polls continue to suggest the Conservative Party enjoys a strong lead over Labour.</p>
      <p>The latest poll averages put the Tories on 43%, with Labour on 29%, the Lib Dems 14%, the Brexit Party 5% and the Greens 3%.</p>

      <p>At this point in the 2017 election campaign, the polls showed the Tories on 47%, with Labour on 31%, the Lib Dems on 8%, Ukip on 5% and the Greens on 3%.</p>
      <p>But on election day, the Tories finished on 43% – four points below where they had been three weeks earlier – while Labour had risen 10 points to 41%.</p>
      <p>While the Lib Dems remained on 8%, both Ukip and the Greens dropped to 2%.</p>

      <p>There was movement in 2015 as well, albeit on a smaller scale and with different consequences.</p>
      <p>Three weeks before polling day in 2015, both the Tories and Labour were averaging 34% with Ukip on 13%, the Lib Dems 8% and the Greens 5%.</p>
      <p>These figures pointed to a hung parliament – but come election day, the Tories opened up a seven-point lead over Labour to finish on 38% while Labour ended on 31%.</p>
      <p>Ukip, the Lib Dems and Green finished on 13%, 8% and 4% respectively.</p>
      <p>This was enough to give the Conservatives a small overall majority in parliament.</p>

      <p>It also serves as a reminder that polls are not predictions, merely snapshots of opinion at a certain point in time.</p>
