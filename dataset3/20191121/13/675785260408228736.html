      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:55:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:55</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> may still be a good week away, but that hasn't stopped almost every tech retailer under the sun launching their offers early.</p>
      <p>But with so many to pick from, it's hard to work out which ones are actually a bargain, and which are just latching onto the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> name.</p>
      <p>Cue Martin Lewis, who has tracked down one very impressive SIM only offer <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=10210&amp;awinaffid=213635&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fstore.three.co.uk%252Fview%252Fbasket%252FSIMOnlyD14022019T093330%5D%5D">from Three Mobile,</a> that gets you 8GB of data for just £8 a month.</p>
      <p>Complete with all-you-can-eat minutes, it's available on a 12 month contract for a mere <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=10210&amp;awinaffid=213635&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fstore.three.co.uk%252Fview%252Fbasket%252FSIMOnlyD14022019T093330%5D%5D">£8 a month,</a> with no upfront cost, working out at just £96 for the entire year.</p>

      <p>Martin Lewis originally revealed the news on Good Morning Britain earlier today, alongside a slew of other Black Friday deals, including a different Smarty SIM only deal that gets you 45GB data, unlimited minutes and texts for just <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10933&amp;clickref=mirror20929192&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsmarty.co.uk%252Fplans%252Flarge%5D%5D">£15 per month on a 12-month contract.</a></p>
      <p>Boots' Black Friday beauty gift sets also earned a spot on his list of best offers, as Martin Lewis praised the brand's No7 Beauty Wardrobe gift set, which is currently just <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=10933&amp;clickref=20929192&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fsmarty.co.uk%252Fplans%252Flarge%5D%5D">£25 instead of £50,</a> but is worth a hefty £87.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for an 8GB SIM only deal, we spotted an even cheaper one on Plusnet, although it's a tad more complex than Three's.</p>
      <p>Working out at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plus.net%2Fmobile%2Fdeals%2Fsim-only-12-month%2F10%2F8GB%2Funl%2Funl%2Frc25%2FMSE%2FNov19&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fmartin-lewis-raves-super-cheap-20929192">£7.92 per month,</a> it's essentially 8GB of data for £10 a month - but with a £25 prepaid Mastercard that you can use in most places. So while it is 96p cheaper than Three's altogether, it's also slightly more faff.</p>
