        <b>Three people have been arrested in the Athlone area in connection with death threats posted on social media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gardaí say they've been investigating a "number of threats to kill and cause serious harm to persons" made on social media in recent days.</p>
      <p>Searches were carried out this morning in the Athlone area by officers looking for both the weapons shown in the online posts and the devices used to record the videos.</p>
      <p>Several devices and weapons were seized during today's searches.</p>
      <p>Three men - two aged in their 20s and one in his late 40s - were arrested during the course of the searches.</p>
      <p>They're now being held at Mullingar and Athlone Garda Station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.</p>
      <p>Gardaí say they're liaising with the PSNI in connection with the arrests, as the videos may be connected to a <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/13-year-old-girl-critically-injured-machete-attack-co-fermanagh-926088">recent serious assault</a></b> in Co Fermanagh.</p>
      <p>A 13-year-old girl was critically injured after a group of men entered a house in Lisnaskea armed with machetes on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old woman was also stabbed in the leg during the attack.</p>
      <p>Police in the North have launched an attempted murder investigation.</p>
