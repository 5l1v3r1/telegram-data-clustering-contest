      <h1>Report: Aston Villa and West Ham eye Nico Gaitan after MLS contract expires</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:15:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/21/nicolas-gaitan-west-ham-aston-villa-free-agent">The Guardian have claimed</a> that Aston Villa, West Ham United and Sheffield United are doing battle for free agent and Argentina interntional Nico Gaitan, after his contract at MLS side Chicago Fire expired.</p>
      <p>The MLS season has finished and will restart in February 2020, meaning that any players have seen their contracts expire. Indeed, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has left LA Galaxy after his deal expired. Gaitan is in a similar boast.</p>
      <p>The former Atletico Madrid and Benfica attacker is now looking for a new home after clocking up 28 appearances for Fire – scoring four goals and laying on 11 assists for his teammates. All three Premier League sides want Gaitan on a two-year deal.</p>
      <p>West Ham are believed to have already opened talks to sign Gaitan, while Villa and Sheffield United are also keen on the attacker. He can play in the number 10 role, but also do a job out wide and in central midfield.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Gaitan a top signing for any team outside top six</h3>
      <p>On a free transfer, Gaitan would be a stunning purchase for any team outside the top six. The Argentinian brings with him enormous pedigree after 253 appearances for Benfica in which he scored 41 times and created 88 goals.</p>
      <p>West Ham have plenty of attacking options but what may prove favourable to Gaitan is that The Hammers boast Argentinian players in their side, in Manuel Lanzini and Pablo Zabaleta. The other sides do not.</p>
