      <h2>As the anniversary of Sigurdsson's record signing looms we look at Everton's spending in a different new era</h2>

      <p>
        <i>The 2010s has been a decade in which Everton take their transfer spending to whole new levels.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Farhad Moshiri's arrival, coupled with the influx of money being pumped into the Premier League from TV deals saw the Blues spend huge amounts on the likes of Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane, Alex Iwobi, Yerry Mina and Davy Klaassen.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>But the Blues have actually only broken their transfer record twice over the past 10 years.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>At the turn of the decade the £15m paid for Marouane Fellaini, brought in from Standard Leige in September 2008, was Everton's record transfer.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The Toffees almost doubled that in 2014 when they paid £28m to make Romelu Lukaku's loan from Chelsea permanent.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>And the Blues blew that out of the water again when Gylfi Sigurdsson arrived for a fee of around £40m.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's Everton correspondent Phil Kirkbride on why Marcel Brands' arrival means that sum might not change for a long while yet:</i>
      </p>
      <p>It was in summer 2017 when Everton pushed themselves into a new financial bracket.</p>
      <p>The signing of Gylfi Sigurdsson, after a drawn-out summer of negotiations with Swansea City, saw the club not only surpass their club record spend on a single player but smash it.</p>
      <p>Romelu Lukaku's £28m arrival from Chelsea had stood as the peak of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>'s spending powers for three years before Ronald Koeman picked up the Icelander for a deal in the region of £40m.</p>
      <p>The closest the Blues have come to such an outlay since has been the signing of Richarlison last summer and where once it felt as though Sigurdsson's position at the top would not last, and that such a spend was a money-spinning sign of things to come, there's a growing feel it's a fee that could be here to stay.</p>
      <p>Certainly as long as Marcel Brands is at the helm.</p>
      <p>Yes, there was an opportunistic, test-the-water £52m bid for Wilfried Zaha in July, but the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/confusing-case-wilfried-zaha-transfer-16732547">finances involved in getting a deal over the line struggled to stack up</a> as the Blues continue to go about reducing their wage bill.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And such a single splurge would have been out of sync with everything else Everton had done under the guidance of the Dutch director of football.</p>
      <p>His Goodison track record suggests Brands could have bought two players for that price.</p>
      <p>Consider the transfer fees he has sanctioned, in descending order: £35m, £28m, £27.5m, £25.4m, £25m, £22m, £18m and £8.5m - every other player signed has either been on a free or loaned.</p>
      <p>The £35m agreement with Watford for Richarlison no doubt included a premium of doing business with another Premier League club, not to mention the boardroom friction which existed, while <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> may also have paid more than the market value to get Alex Iwobi's move done on deadline day.</p>
      <p>And so where Everton's summer spending was moving in one direction when Sigurdsson was signed, that chart topping £40m appears to be the ceiling, for now at least.</p>
      <p>Bigger transfer fees would tend to lend themselves to bigger wages and that's not the direction the Blues are heading in, right now.</p>
      <p>Marco Silva's assessment of the challenges the Blues faced in recent weeks and months, was illuminating.</p>
      <p>“I can tell you, last season was fantastic for us,” <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/marco-silva-explains-difficulties-transfer-16751801">he told the ECHO</a>.</p>
      <p>“This season we have signed very good players but the market was more difficult.</p>
      <p>“You look at the money some clubs are asking for players and the market is really difficult in England and to buy players inside is something unbelievable.”</p>
      <p>Brands has already made it clear that the level of spending seen in January 2018 would not happen under his watch and so, after two windows, the same can be said of the summer market.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>For example, the 57-year-old said he wouldn't even countenance a move for Hirving Lozano - a player he plucked from Mexican football with PSV and who had become hot property in Europe – at €30m.</p>
      <p>That, he said, didn't represent value for Everton's money.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the 24-year-old would end up moving to Napoli for €42m at the end of August.</p>
      <p>Even Farhad Moshiri's assertion at the General Meeting that big fees may have to be paid was put into a context that was laid out this summer.</p>
      <p>“It is why football experts of Marcel's calibre are needed, infrastructure is important and to comply with financial fair play you need to go for younger players on low wages. You might have to pay big fees but you've got to keep the wages down and that is the challenge," the majority shareholder said.</p>
      <p>But it seems the definition of 'big fees' has changed at Goodison and it could be why Sigurdsson's reign as Everton's most expensive player will carry on for a while yet.</p>
