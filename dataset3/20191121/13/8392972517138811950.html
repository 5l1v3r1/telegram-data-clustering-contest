      <h1>I'm A Celebrity: Viewers are making the same joke about Nadine's singing</h1>
      <h2>Singer said she's too shy to, ahem, sing…</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:01:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Nancy Brown</a></address>
      <p>Viewers have reacted to Nadine Coyle's shock revelation that she's "really really shy" so won't be singing in the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> jungle.</p>
      <p>During a probing chat with campmate Jacqueline Jossa, Nadine revealed that while she still gigs "all the time", she won't be warbling during her stint in Oz.</p>

      <p>"Can you sing to us at some point?" Jac asked.</p>

      </p>
      <p>"See, I'm so shy, I am really really shy," came Nadine's reply. "How I became a singer and how I do any of this stuff is just beyond me."</p>
      <p>"Maybe less pressured then," Jacqueline pushed, "in a different environment?"</p>

      <p>"Yes, of course," came the former Girls Aloud star's reply. "If we're out drinking and having a good time then I will be singing."</p>

      <p>However, it appears many viewers were all thinking the same thing, with some questioning Nadine's vocal prowess without the use of auto-tune.</p>

      <p>However, 'journalist' Jac wasn't done there and asked if they should perhaps get "jungle Girls Aloud" together.</p>
      <aside>I'm so shy (about singing)… with no auto-tune and a ton of studio equipment.</aside>
      <p>Jac then proceeded to belt out Girls Aloud tune The Promise, with the help of Adele.</p>
      <p>"I notice you haven't sung any of the words yet," she said to Nadine.</p>
      <p>"No, no, no," came the response.</p>

      <p>"Do you remember them?" Jac asked.</p>
      <p>"I do. Of course," said Nadine.</p>
      <p>"Come on then," Jac pushed.</p>
      <p>"I'm really bad with the words, sometimes I've been singing words at shows and fans have been singing the actual words and I've been singing the wrong ones," she explained.</p>
      <p>However, fans had a different idea, going back to Nadine's earlier point that she was "shy" and cruelly asking if she really said "sh**e".</p>

      <p>Speaking in the Bush Telegraph, Jacqueline – <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/bookies-predict-jacqueline-jossa-will-win-this-years-im-a-celebrity/">who bookies have said is the favourite to win</a> – said she would happily join Girls Aloud. So it looks as if Nadine has an out, should she want one!</p>
