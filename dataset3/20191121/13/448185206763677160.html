      <p><b>Mumbai</b><b>:</b> The Kingfisher House — the erstwhile headquarters of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. (KAL) – owned by absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya, will be up for auction again. The 8th time in barely three years. The Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT), Bengaluru, has announced a new auction date of November 27 through an online bidding process, for the beleaguered property.</p>
      <p>From the original reserve price of Rs 135 crore during the first auction of the property — valued at around Rs 150 crore in 2016 — for the 8th auction this time, the reserve price is fixed at a staggeringly low of just Rs 54 crore, a sharp drop of 60 percent. The building, originally known as Paradigm, and later as Kingfisher House, includes a basement, an upper ground floor, a ground floor and an upper floor which are now up for sale, totally measuring 1,586 sq meters. It is situated on a plot measuring around 2,402 sq. meters in a coveted location, bang outside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA).</p>
      <p>Experts say an important factor affecting the property sale is the massive encroachment — of around 725 sq. meters — giving a net saleable area of just 1,677 sq. meters. Another consideration weighing the minds of the potential buyers is the limited scope of a redevelopment or exploiting it in the future owing to the height restrictions on building constructions as it falls in the vicinity of the CSMIA, among the busiest in the country.
