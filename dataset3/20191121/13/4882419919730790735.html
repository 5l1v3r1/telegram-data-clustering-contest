      <p>Over the last few months, Marcelo Gallardo has been strongly linked with a move to FC Barcelona. The current River Plate coach is on the club's shortlist and Rivaldo believes the Argentinian is ready to manage an elite side in Europe.</p>
      <p>"Of course I believe he could coach Barcelona. He's preparing for that. His work at River Plate has been fantastic. He won the Libertadores last year. He's at the point where he's ready to go to Europe and manage a top side like Barcelona," Rivaldo told Betfair.</p>
      <p>River Plate take on Flamengo in Lima, Peru and another victory could establish the Argentine side as one of the greatest ever teams. "If River win back-to-back Libertadores, everyone on the planet will be talking about them."</p>
