      <h2>WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT A patient went to a hospital in China after he was left with a constant nosebleed following a drink of water from a river two weeks ago</h2>

      <p>A man who complained of a constant nosebleed was shocked to find a three inch leech had been living in his nose for half a month.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old man, whose name has not been disclosed, said he had been suffering from a nosebleed for two weeks when he decided to seek help at Sanhe Hospital in Huizhou, Guangdong province of southeast China.</p>
      <p>Ear, Nose and Throat specialist Dr Wang Yanfeng suspected the patient had a leech living in his nasal cavity upon an initial inspection.</p>
      <p>He confirmed his speculation when he shone a torch up the patient's nostril - and found the parasite wriggling furiously away from the light source.</p>
      <p>Video shows Dr Wang spraying anaesthetics to the patient's nostrils before extracting the leech measuring 3.15 inches long.</p>

      <p>The lively parasite tried to wriggle free as it is unwittingly removed from its host.</p>
      <p>According to the hospital, the patient later revealed he had water from a river while hiking with friends in Yunnan two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Dr Wang suspected her accidentally inhaled the leech larva into his nose, and the young parasite spent two weeks growing in the nasal cavity while feeding on his blood.</p>

      <p>The patient is expected to make a full recovery.</p>
      <p>Leeches can attach themselves to a person's skin or even inside their nose or mouth.</p>
      <p>When this happens, the person suffers from a condition called hirudiniasis, according to Mark Siddall, an expert on leeches.</p>
      <p>Mr Siddall spoke in an interview with Live Science explaining that a leech can suck as much blood as about five times its unfed body weight.</p>
