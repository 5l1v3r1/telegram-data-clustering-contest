      <p>​The post by Dadlani, who has made music for acclaimed films like "Bajirao Mastani", "Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani", and "Taare Zameen Par", didn’t go down well with social media users, who expressed their opinion on the same, demanding that the entertainment channel Sony sack him as a judge in the ongoing singing reality show “Indian Idol”, an Indian adaptation of “American Idol”.</p>

      <p>During his tenure as CJI, which lasted until last week, Justice Gogoi gave various key landmark judgments, with the most crucial among them being his last one related to the decades-old contentious Ayodhya land dispute title case. The 1950 Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case’s verdict was awaited by millions of Hindus and Muslims in the country.</p>
      <p>The Ayodhya land dispute, a decades-old religious conflict between the Hindu and Muslim communities in India, flared up following the 1992 demolition of a mosque by Hindus in Ayodhya town in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
      <p>After the demolition of the mosque on 6 December 1992, Hindus constructed a makeshift temple in the name of Lord Ram, who is believed to have been born at the site.</p>
      <p>The mosque's destruction followed Hindu-Muslim violence. Subsequent years witnessed groups belonging to both religions bickering in courts over who should have control over the historic site.</p>
      <p>On 9 November, the Justice Gogoi as the then CJI headed the Supreme Court Bench in a historic verdict that gave the disputed area of land in Ayodhya town to a trust to build a temple for Hindus and the Muslims received an alternate area to build a mosque at any prominent place in the town.</p>
