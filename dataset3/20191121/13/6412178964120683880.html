        <b>Arsenal have reportedly made an opening enquiry to Villarreal for defender Pau Torres after deciding the €40m star is the man they want to partner William Saliba at the heart of their defence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has started all 13 of the Yellow Submarine’s LaLiga games to date this season and also made his senior debut for Spain national earlier this month, netting as a replacement for Sergio Ramos in the 7-0 win over Malta.</p>
      <p><i>ABC De Sevilla</i> states that the Gunners are hopeful new signing <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/william-saliba"><b>Saliba</b></a>, who is currently on loan at Saint Etienne, will be the long-term future of the club’s backline while <i>The Sun</i> adds that Torres has been identified as a potential partner.</p>
      <p>Arsenal have struggled defensively again this season, with David Luiz not really providing the solidity that Unai Emery had hoped for after his summer arrival from Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Torres broke onto the scene during a loan spell at second tier Malaga last season, where he made 40 appearances, and has now impressed in Villarreal’s back four.</p>
      <p>It is claimed the player has a €45m release clause, while he is also under contract until 2023.</p>
