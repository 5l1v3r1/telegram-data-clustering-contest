      <p>Emergency workers who were called to help after reports that a baby was stuck in a drain in Newlands, Durban, on Thursday found a frightened and shivering puppy instead.</p>
      <p>Rescue Care's Garrith Jamieson said paramedics responded after reports that a baby was heard crying.</p>
      <p>However, when paramedics and personnel from Durban Search and Rescue, police and the fire department arrived at the scene, the cries sounded to them like a puppy's.</p>
      <p>Jamieson said paramedics Emma Westcott and Leon Fourie went down the drain to locate the puppy. The black puppy was rescued a short while later. Fourie named it Perseverance.</p>
      <p>"I gave it that name because it managed to find a dry spot and stay alive despite the fact that it was freezing and there was lots of water in that pipe,"  Fourie said.</p>
      <p>Student Mpilo Mthethwa raised the alarm after hearing a crying sound in the stormwater drain in his yard and went to investigate.</p>
      <p>He told TimesLIVE that he tried opening the drain and when he couldn't, he tried calling the police. He also alerted his sister who managed to report the matter to police.  </p>
      <p>Jamieson said the cold and malnourished puppy was warmed up and taken to the SPCA for adoption and care.</p>
      <p>In February this year, <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2019-02-11-i-thought-it-was-a-kitty-cat-resident-helps-rescue-baby-stuck-in-a-drain/">Baby Sibanisethu</a>, named by the community, was plucked from a stormwater drain in Newlands east in a dramatic four-hour rescue.</p>
      <p>Her mother, who is facing a charge of attempted murder, was arrested in hospital.</p>
