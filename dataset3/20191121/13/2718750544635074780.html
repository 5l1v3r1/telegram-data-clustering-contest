      <p>This Christmas, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/kacey-musgraves/">Kacey Musgraves</a> is thankful for a gift Santa didn’t bring: her man. Her new holiday song “Glittery” is a smooth Christmas ode to the loved ones whose presence feels like the real present. She dropped by <i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i> to debut the new track, looking like a Christmas-tree topper in an all-glitter suit. “You shake me up and turn me upside down just like a snow globe,” she sings at the song’s opening. “And every time you touch me I shiver right down to my toes.” “Glittery” is a cozy tune for sitting near fireplaces, watching the snow fall through the window, and forgetting the holiday is actually about consumerism. Oh, speaking of which, Spacey Kacey is hosting the <i>Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show</i>, out November 29, only on Amazon Prime Video. Special guests include <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/album-review-lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell.html">Lana Del Rey</a>, Troye Sivan, and Musgraves’s own nana. This is everything the holidays are about!</p>
