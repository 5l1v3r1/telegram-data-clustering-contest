        <b>Rory McIlroy's opened with an eight-under-par first-round 64 at the European Tour season-ending DP World Tour Championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It leaves the world number two just one shot behind the clubhouse leader Mike Lorenzo Vera.</p>
      <p>McIlroy closed his round with an eagle on the last hole and he says it's a great way to finish.</p>
      <p>"It's possibly the best shot I've hit all year," the FedEx Cup champion said of his three-wood approach into the 18th.</p>
      <p>"I had 272 to the front, 291 to the pin; the wind was off the left so it was a nice one for me.</p>
      <p>"I just flushed it. As soon as I hit it I knew it was perfect - it was right out of the middle.</p>
      <p>"It was great - I started off fast, basically did what I told you I should do starting off.</p>
      <p>"I birdied the two par-fives on the front nine and did what I needed to do. It was nice to finish the way I did, I hit a lot of quality shots coming in."</p>
      <p>Open champion Shane Lowry has signed for a one-over round of 73 and has ground to make up on his Race to Dubai rivals.</p>
      <p>Jon Rahm closed six-under-par, Tommy Fleetwood five-under and Order of Merit leader Bernd Wiesberger two-under.</p>
