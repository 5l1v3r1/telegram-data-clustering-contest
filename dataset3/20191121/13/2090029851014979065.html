      <p>Recall Invictus Obi was arrested by the FBI in August for an alleged $11 million fraud. Invictus is standing trial in the United States of American for an alleged cyber fraud following his indictment alongside 77 Nigerians.</p>
      <p>Justice Aikawa ordered the interim forfeiture of the funds and asked the commission to publish in any national newspaper, the interim order for the named parties or anyone who is interested in the monies sought to be forfeited to appear before the court to show cause within 14 days why the final order of forfeiture should not be made in favour of the Federal Government.</p>
      <p>The commission said it traced the said amount to Mr Okeke in bank accounts of Invictus Oil and Gas Limited and Invictus Investment Limited.</p>
