      <h1>Tesco blunder sees Sainsbury's squash on one of its shelves - and customers have the same wild theory</h1>
      <h2>It was spotted by Demi Boonham, who posted a picture of the mistake in a popular bargain hunters' Facebook group</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:32:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:32</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Shoppers have spotted an embarrassing error as Sainsbury's squash was put on the shelves in Tesco.</p>
      <p>Demi Boonham posted an image with the caption "spot the error", reports <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/huge-tesco-blunder-sainsburys-squash-17291142">Birmingham Live</a>.</p>
      <p>It's not clear how a Sainsbury's own brand product came to be on the shelves at Britain's largest grocer.</p>
      <p>Some eagle-eyed customers believe the picture proves both retailers are stocking identical products - with the manufacturer simply changing the label.</p>
      <p>One commenter said: "Just goes to show that some brands are actually the same."</p>
      <p>"Can't wait to show my husband this, he swears he only likes the Tesco brand, brilliant haha," a second added.</p>
      <p>A third said: "It took me way to long to see what was wrong in this picture."</p>
      <p>And a fourth wrote: "Awww. The poor lonely Sainsbury's bottle."</p>
      <p>Another shopper wrote: "I got broccoli with a Sainsbury's label on in Tesco the other day and the cashier thought I'd planted it."</p>
      <p>"I got Morrison's gluten free sausages in my Tesco delivery once," another said.</p>
      <p>And another wrote: "I bought Sainsbury's milk in Aldi once."</p>
