      <p>First up, in case you didn’t hear, Will Ferrell is returning to host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SB4ebtdBkkI&amp;feature=emb_title"><i>Saturday Night Live</i></a> on November 23 this weekend. But before he gets down to starring in sketches, he wanted to dig up part of the mainstage in Studio 8H to get the buried treasure he put there so long ago. The only problem is his investment hasn’t matured at all since then.</p>
