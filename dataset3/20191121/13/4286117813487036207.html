      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Eden Gardens hosted the 1987 World Cup final</li>
        <li>Eden will host the 1st ever pink-ball Test in India</li>
        <li>Eden Gardens will be hosting its 42nd Test match -- the most by an Indian venue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With less than 24 hours to go for the historic <b><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/pink-ball-test-eden-gardens-india-vs-bangladesh-sachin-tendulkar-1621171-2019-11-21">Day-night Test</a></b> between India and Bangladesh at the Eden Gardens, the talks at tea stalls or dinner tables in Kolkata would be probably revolving around how the pacers are going to swing the pink ball or how dew will play a major role when the floodlights are on. People in Kolkata love cricket and thus all these debates and discussions are bound to happen.</p>
      <p>It was the enthusiastic crowd at the Eden Gardens which made the 1987 World Cup final look like a World Cup final even though India were knocked out by England in the semi-final as the cricket lovers thronged the stadium in huge numbers to give Australia a feel of lifting the World Cup trophy at Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Eden Gardens could unofficially be called the 'home of cricket' in India because it is this iconic stadium that has witnessed many firsts in the history of Indian cricket. From hosting the first World Cup final outside Lords (1987) to VVS Laxman's 281 against Australia in 2001 or Rohit Sharma's 264 off 173 against Sri Lanka, Eden Gardens has seen it all. And once again, it is gearing up for another historic occasion as India will be playing their first Test under floodlights here.</p>
      <p>The venue will be hosting its 42nd Test match, which is the most hosted at an Indian venue. In this century, India have played 11 Tests at Eden Gardens of which they have won 7 and lost just 1 (against England in 2012).</p>
      <p>
        <b>A day before India's first pink ball Test, here we turn back the pages of time to revisit the historic occasions braced by Eden Gardens.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>1987: World Cup Final</b>
      </p>
      <p>Until 1987, the World Cup was monopolized by England. It hosted the first three World Cups but in 1987, for the first time, the tournament was held outside England and the final was held at Eden Gardens. India were knocked out of the World Cup by England in the semi-final. Australia won the final at Eden Gardens, defeating England by 7 runs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1991: South Africa's readmission into international cricket</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Africa made their historic trip to India in 1991 for 3-match ODI series after the country was readmitted as a Full Member of the ICC after serving a 20-year ban for its apartheid policy. Then South African team member Brian McMillan had said the number of people in one cricket ground was well over 90,000 and the noise was unbelievable.</p>
      <p>2001: India beat Australia; Laxman, Harbhajan rewrite history</p>
      <p>On 15th March, 2001, India snatched victory from the jaws to put an end to Steve Waugh's winning streak of 16 Test matches and give birth to a new era in the India cricket.</p>
      <p>Australia batted first after winning the toss and piled 445 in their first innings. In reply, India were all out for 171 and Waugh then imposed a follow-on given India were not considered a big threat against a formidable side like Australia. While batting again, India were 252/4, trailing by 20.</p>
      <p>In the last two days of the Test, India turned the tables around with VVS Laxman broking Sunil Gavaskar's record score of 236 by scoring a majestic 281 and Rahul Dravid making 180 to declare their innings at 657/7 - the second-highest test score at that time.</p>
      <p>When Australia came out to defend the total, a draw seemed unavoidable but then came the young Harbhajan Singh who changed the course of the match. The Punjab off-spinner became the first Indian bowler to take a hat-trick in Test cricket to help India put an end to Australia's dominance in world cricket.</p>
      <p>VVS Laxman's historic 281 in that series remains to be the highest score at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rohit Sharma's 264</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rohit Sharma'a 264 against Sri Lanka in 2014, still remains to be the highest individual score in 50-over format of the game. It was also his second double hundred in ODI format. Rohit Sharma's debut Test hundred also came at the Eden Gardens.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shoaib Akhtar's arrival</b>
      </p>
      <p>Eden Gardens hosted the first-ever Asian Test Championship match between India and Pakistan in 1991 and eight-Test old Shoaib Akhtar made it special for his team as he bagged two crucial wickets on two back-to-back yorkers to help Pakistan win the inaugural Test.</p>
      <p>Shoaib Akhtar first bowled an unplayable delivery to remove Rahul Dravid's leg stump and then sent the crowd at Eden Gardens into silence when he got Sachin Tendulkar on the very next delivery.</p>
