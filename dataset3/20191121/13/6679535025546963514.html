      <p>The examination fee has been increased by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on ‘no profit no loss’ principle, Union HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“The Board has increased the examination fees of class X and XII examination 2020 for all students on ‘no profit no loss’ principle,” he told Rajya Sabha in response to a written question.</p>
      <p>The CBSE had in August announced hike in board exam fees across categories.</p>
      <p>The CBSE had notified an increase in the examination fees for Classes 10 and 12, registration fees for Classes 9 and 11 and migration fees. The fees for general category students for Classes 10 and 12 were doubled from ₹750 to ₹1,500 for five subjects.</p>
      <p>The Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) students, who were paying ₹375 earlier, will now pay ₹1200 for five subjects. Under a special arrangement in the national capital, these students were only paying ₹50, while the Delhi government was paying the rest of the amount as subsidy.</p>
      <p>Following the CBSE notification, the Delhi government had announced that students at state-run and aided schools will not have to pay any fees for class 10 and 12 CBSE examinations and the cost will be borne by the city administration.</p>
      <p>The CBSE officials had then claimed that a deficit of over ₹200 crore in conducting board examination for class 10 and 12 has forced the CBSE to hike fees.</p>
      <p>“Early board results, measures to make examination leak proof and error-free evaluation have imposed a financial burden on the CBSE,” a senior board official had said.</p>
