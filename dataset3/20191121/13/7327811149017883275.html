      <p>ELIZABETH, New Jersey (WABC) -- A teenager who was riding an e-scooter is dead after being struck by a tow truck in Elizabeth, New Jersey.</p>
      <p>He is the first fatality in the city's newly created scooter share program.</p>
      <p>The incident happened around 8 p.m. Wednesday at the corner of Elizabeth Avenue and South Spring Street in downtown Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>Police say the 16-year-old boy was riding a Lime scooter when he was struck by a large tow truck.</p>
      <p>The victim was rushed to an area hospital. He did not survive. His name has not been released.</p>

      <p>Police say the driver of the tow truck stopped at the scene. No charges were immediately filed.</p>
      <p>The accident is under investigation by the Elizabeth Police Department, which is expected to release information later today.</p>
      <p>The city of Elizabeth just launched their scooter program at the beginning of this month, releasing photos of officers who will be patrolling on them.</p>
      <p>The 400 scooters in the city cost $1 to unlock, plus 20 cents per minute to ride.</p>
      <p>As part of a revenue sharing agreement with Lime, the city receives 10 cents per ride, which offsets the cost of policing the scooters.</p>
      <p>It is against Lime's user agreement for any rider to be under the age of 18.</p>
      <p>Lime released the following statement Thursday morning through a spokesperson:</p>
      <p>"We are absolutely devastated by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the victim's family and friends during this incredibly difficult time. We are in close contact with Elizabeth officials and stand ready to assist in any way we can."</p>
      <p>Several other New Jersey cities also have scooter programs, including Hoboken, which has started patrolling scooter riders.</p>
      <p>A Oja scooter collided with a mother and baby there.</p>
      <p>The name of the victim in Wednesday night's incident has not been released.</p>
