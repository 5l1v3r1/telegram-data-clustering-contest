      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s opposition Labour Party said on Thursday it would increase annual government spending by 82.9 billion pounds by the 2023/24 financial year if it wins Dec. 12’s national election, on top of increases in public investment.</p>
      <p>Labour said in its manifesto that the extra spending would be fully covered by higher taxes on top earners and business.</p>
      <p>The party said it would aim to run a balanced budget for non-investment spending after five years, and keep debt interest payments below 10% of tax revenues, but would waive these rules if the Bank of England restarted quantitative easing.</p>
