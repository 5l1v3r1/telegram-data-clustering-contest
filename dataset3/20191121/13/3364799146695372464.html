      <p>Just as cofounder Travis Kalanick <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/travis-kalanick-sells-another-171-million-of-uber-stock-2019-11-1028701056?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">cashes in his Uber stock</a>, the company's new CEO is buying more shares.</p>
      <p>Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, spent $6.7 million for 250,000 shares of the ride-hailing company at $26.75 per share on Monday, according to a filing with <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1184237/000156218019005611/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">the Securities and Exchange Commission</a>. He now holds 1.53 million shares of Uber, roughly 0.09% of the shares outstanding. </p>
      <p>Uber declined to comment on the share purchases. </p>
      <p>Kalanick, on the other hand, has sold more than <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/travis-kalanick-sells-another-171-million-of-uber-stock-2019-11-1028701056?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">$882 million</a> worth of Uber shares since the company's <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-stock-price-post-ipo-lockup-value-lowest-since-2015-2019-11-1028665630?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">post-initial public offering lockup expiration</a> on November 6. He's done this in three separate installments, with the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/travis-kalanick-sells-another-171-million-of-uber-stock-2019-11-1028701056?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">most recent</a> concluding this week. Even after the sales, Kalanick still owns more than 65 million Uber shares, of 3.82% of total outstanding stock.</p>
      <p>The expiration date, 180 days after Uber listed on the public market, prompted a massive sell-off that sent the company's shares <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/uber-stock-price-post-ipo-lockup-value-lowest-since-2015-2019-11-1028665630?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">to record lows</a>. And, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-original-pitch-deck-shows-evolution-ipo-2018-12?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">insiders continue to sell</a>, including <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/ubers-chief-product-officer-is-stepping-down/">soon-to-be former</a> Chief Product Officer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005602/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">Manik Gupta</a>, Chief Accounting Officer <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1525321/000156218019005603/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">Glen Ceremony</a>, and co-founder and board member <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000156218019005621/xslF345X03/primarydocument.xml">Garrett Camp</a>.</p>
      <p>Since Khosrowshahi purchased the extra shares, Uber stock has risen roughly 10%, including gains during the day Thursday. Khosrowshahi, who <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-expedia-head-dara-khosrowshahi-new-ceo-of-uber-2017-8?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">left Expedia in 2017 to take the top job at Uber,</a> owns other shares of the company acquired through awards of restricted stock units that have not all vested, <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/uber-ceo-dara-khosrowshahi-is-buying-up-the-stock-51574347148?mod=RTA">according to Barron's</a>.</p>
      <p>Uber has lost roughly <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/uber-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">38% year-to-date through Wednesday's close</a>. </p>
