        <b>A manufacturer has stepped forward to pay for a clinical safety audit after NHS England cut its funding.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The National Ophthalmology Database has been running since 2010 and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists credits it with helping improve patient safety over that period.</p>
      <p>Alcon, which makes equipment for the sector, on Wednesday said it would spend £240,000 to keep the audit running for another three years.</p>
      <p>Ophthalmology is one of the biggest elective specialties in the NHS, with taxpayers funding 410,000 cataract surgeries in England a year, costing around £450m.</p>
      <p>The NOD dataset measures performance against two common complications of cataract surgery. The number of trusts and surgeons submitting their data is improving, <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-safety/revealed-the-trusts-with-the-highest-cataract-complication-rates/7026112.article">but some outliers say there are problems with their data.</a> Others have said they have made changes to their services as a result.</p>
      <p>The data shows a 37 per cent decrease in procedures leading to a loss of visual acuity since 2010.</p>
      <p>NHS England funding ceased in August this year.</p>
      <p>In February, the <a href="https://www.rcophth.ac.uk/2019/02/makemydatacount/">Royal College of Ophthalmologists said NHSE’s approach to funding clinical audits was at odds with the ambitions in the long-term plan</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement, it said: “NHS England’s current model of funding national audits is short-sighted. Funding is generally withdrawn after a contracted three years or more and if organisations are unable to secure further funding, all that data and learning is potentially lost.”</p>
      <p>NHSE has been approached for comment.</p>
      <p>The Royal College of Ophthalmologists welcomed the move by Alcon, and another supplier, Bausch and Long, who are paying £10,000 towards the audit. The programme will continue as before with the new funding.</p>
      <p>RCOphth president Mike Burdon said: “This investment by Alcon demonstrates how crucial partnerships between industry [and] the college are in sustaining projects that make a real difference.</p>
      <p>“With NOD being at the forefront of reducing complications, achieving high data completeness and resulting in considerable savings for a stretched health service, contributions by Alcon and Bausch + Long will [allow] us to continue and improve an already high performing service.”</p>
      <p>Alcon Eye Care Limited, owned by Swiss pharmaceutical firm Novartis, had <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/00809238">a turnover of £141m in its most recent annual accounts.</a></p>
