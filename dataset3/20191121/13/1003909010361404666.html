      <h3>UCP’s war path won’t lead to peace, or prosperity, in Alberta</h3>
      <p>Jason Kenny has gone to Texas to drum up investment for our oil and gas industry. I question if Texas is right for his campaign knowing that they are experiencing investment issues similar to Alberta. More pointedly, business does not like uncertainty and chaos. That is exactly what is occurring in Alberta. Uncertainties over Alberta’s place in Canada, a strong strategic ally of the United States; management of taxes, pension funds, policing, possible new provincial constitution; relationship with environmental groups (investors don’t want to see daily protests camped in front of their offices); relationship with public sector workers, universities and students and his election as party leader.</p>
      <p>Kenney does not appear to see a fight he does not like/engage. My advice, for what it is worth: Stay home, mend fences, then invite investors to a peaceful province.</p>

      <h3>Ag outreach helps beekeepers</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Rural representatives grill provincial ministers, Nov. 16</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Alberta Beekeepers Commission supports the ongoing outreach by the Jason Kenney government. We appreciate Minister Dreeshen’s comments acknowledging Albertans’ difficult year in agriculture.</p>
      <p>Our Alberta bees contribute over $67 million to the Alberta economy and are relied on for pollination by the $25-billion hybrid seed canola sector. We buy eight per cent of Alberta’s sugar beet crop to keep our bees alive over the winter. Even before this year’s “harvest from hell,” Alberta beekeepers took a loss of $20 million due to two consecutive bad winters. This year, a cold, wet spring and summer meant 67 per cent of our beekeepers suffered crop losses of 50 per cent or greater. As you can see our bees are in crisis.</p>
      <p>We are looking to work together with Alberta and the federal government to find a solution to help our beekeepers and our Alberta bees so we can keep producing honey and pollinate farmers’ crops.</p>

      <h3>UCP government doing opposite of what was promised</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: Commissioner Investigating UCP Leadership Race Axed, Nov. 19</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am much dismayed by what the UCP government is pushing through the Legislature. Bill 22 is one example of something which is not about to make our province great.  Jason Kenney ran a campaign with a huge focus on improving the economy and employment. Instead, he seems intent on cuts that reduce employment and the weakening of the public sector, unionized employees and public services upon which all Albertans depend. We are headed down a dangerous path.</p>
      <p>Do the people who elected the UCP to power really continue to feel that things are looking up for our province? I for one think exactly the opposite.</p>

      <h3>Ethics of government questioned</h3>
      <p>To be honest, I did not vote for this government, but I’m curious to understand if the average Albertan is on board with all that is included in omnibus Bill 22.</p>
      <p>I find it abhorrent that Bill 22 is filled with so many under the radar items that Albertans did not have any voice in and the UCP did not campaign on. I’m referring specifically to the firing of the elections officer while their party leadership race was under investigation, the takeover of the teacher’s pension plan, the doctor’s conscience bill, talk of leaving CPP and the creation of a provincial police force.</p>
      <p>This is an intentional tactic to throw so many items in one bill and introduce a new one every day so we have no time to research the impact of each bill individually.</p>
      <p>To me, this is a sign of an ethically bankrupt government. Am I alone?</p>

      <h3>Puzzled over Alberta oil</h3>
      <p>Having lived in Alberta for 59 years, I often wondered why Peter Lougheed’s Heritage Trust Fund was not used to diversify the Alberta economy. Now the proposed expansion of Trans Mountain has added additional confusion. I’m hearing about the need to access Asian markets for Alberta crude.</p>
      <p>In a report last year by James Wilt for The Narwhal, it was noted the current line has capacity; but is not being used — in part because the Port of Vancouver cannot serve the size of tanker that would make shipments to Asia economical. Economist Robyn Allan noted that currently all exports go to the U.S. via either the existing Trans Mountain line, Keystone XL or Enbridge Line 3. The U.S. has refining capacity for Alberta’s bitumen along with cheaper transportation fees and deepwater ports for tankers that can carry two million barrels.</p>
      <p>It would seem then, that the rationale for Trans Mountain expansion is not supported by what has just been described. So, I ask why did we buy in to an expansion project that was not really needed and why has there been such a continued push from the governments of Canada and Alberta?</p>

      <h3>Alberta’s contributions need to be recognized</h3>
      <p>Canada is one of the best countries in the world to live in. Alberta is one of the best provinces in Canada. Oil and gas provides 11 per cent of the countries GDP. If we add the supporting industries, this bumps up to over 20 per cent GDP.</p>
      <p>We wish to share our resources with the rest of Canada and the world. Unfortunately, we are unable to do that due to the divisions that exist in our country. This has created a business environment of low return and high risk.</p>
      <p>I am not one that favours separation, but we have to get the attention of the rest of Canada. We already have legislation that allows us to stop shipping our resources to B.C. Lets broaden it to include the rest of Canada.</p>

      <h3>Tolerance needed</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: City should adopt definition of anti-Semitism, Opinion, Nov. 17</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am horrified about the high and increasing level of anti-Semitism in Canada.</p>
      <p>A society that harbours hatred is not a peaceful and tolerant society. Prejudice<b>,</b> unjustly ascribing some inadequacy to an identifiable group or race, is contrary to Canada’s multiracial society. Canadians take pride in being a place where everyone is safe and respected.</p>
      <p>Jewish people have flourished, as a race, in spite of much persecution and have outlasted many mighty empires. They have preserved their identity, without a country of their own. Wherever they have found themselves, they have become valued, contributing citizens.</p>
      <p>As a Christian, I stand up with Jews, asking forgiveness.</p>

      <h3>Better places to cut than police services</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Re: City tax scenarios include cuts to police, fire services, Nov. 13</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am not part of the Calgary Police Service. I am not terribly appreciative if they happen to pull me over with flashing red and blue lights indicating I did something wrong. But, I truly appreciate the service they perform every single day. Thank you.</p>
      <p>Now is not the time for budget cuts or even a budget freeze. It is time for a budget increase to enable the CPS to do the work the citizens have entrusted them to do. Surely, there are many, many places to cut municipal government spending before the safety and well-being of the citizens of Calgary and those who visit Calgary are compromised.</p>

      <h3>Insurance is there for a reason</h3>
      <p>While lobbyists for the insurance industry apparently want to blame Albertans hurt by reckless drivers for a planned increase in vehicle insurance premiums, it is wrong to blame victims.</p>
      <p>In the summer of 2016, I was the “meat in the sandwich” of a three-vehicle rear-ender. I was rushed to hospital with a concussion as well as whiplash and various other soft tissue injuries. Over three years later and all sorts of treatment, I still suffer. Medical experts say I will never fully recover from the injuries.</p>
      <p>The whole point of insurance is that a community of millions chip in some money in the form of premiums to create a pool of funds available to compensate the thousands of ordinary Albertans who are injured by negligent motorists. Perhaps insurance companies would rather rake in premiums, but pocket that cash instead of having to fully compensate innocent injured for pain and suffering?</p>
