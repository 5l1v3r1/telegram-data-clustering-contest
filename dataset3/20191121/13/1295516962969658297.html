      <h1>IT Writer Won't Rule Out a Chapter Three Sequel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:11:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:11</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Russell</a></address>
      <p>Gary Dauberman, the writer behind both <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/it/"><i>IT</i></a> and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/it-chapter-2/"><i>IT: Chapter Two</i></a>, believes there's enough material within Stephen King's novel to create further movies and spinoffs revolving around the demonic entity <a href="https://screenrant.com/it-chapter-2-james-mcavoy-pennywise-scared/amp/">Pennywise</a>.</p>
      <p>"I do think it's possible," Dauberman told <a href="https://www.comicbookmovie.com/horror/it-chapter-two-writer-gary-dauberman-talks-spinoff-possibilities-and-that-rumored-supercut-exclusive-a171703">ComicBookMovie.com</a>. "Anything in the Stephen King Universe interests me but there's only so much of the story we could tell in the two movies. There are definitely elements of the novel you could expand on and make its own movie. It's just a question of whether or not people want to see it but I do think IT was on this planet for a very, very, very long time and that's a lot of bloodshed and a lot of stories to tell and I think you could do that for sure."</p>

      <p>Much like its predecessor, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/it-chapter-two-second-weekend-top-box-office-franchise-1-billion/"><i>IT: Chapter Two</i></a> was a box office smash. Combined with the first movie's total gross, the franchise has earned over $1 billion to date, making the allure of potential spinoffs featuring Pennywise in different forms and at various historical times all the more appealing for Warner Bros.</p>
      <p><i>IT: Chapter Two</i> stars Bill Skarsgård, James McAvoy, Jessica Chastain, Jay Ryan, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, James Ransone, Andy Bean, Teach Grant, Jess Weixler, Will Beinbrink, Xavier Dolan, Jaeden Lieberher, Sophia Lillis, Jeremy Ray Taylor, Finn Wolfhard, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, Wyatt Oleff and Nicholas Hamilton.</p>
