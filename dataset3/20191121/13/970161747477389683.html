      <p>McFly delighted fans by reuniting for a very special one-off concert at London’s O2 on Wednesday, but despite not having performed together for over three years, they say it’s like ‘no time’ has passed.</p>
      <p>The band announced the gig in September, and<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/10/mcflys-tom-fletcher-says-even-didnt-lost-songs-band-announce-comeback-gig-10717543/"> gave fans one of their ‘Lost Songs’ – tracks they had recorded almost 10 years ago – each week</a> in the run up to the big night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/10/mcfly-announce-one-off-london-show-nine-years-last-album-buzzing-10716383/">Tickets obviously sold out in minutes</a>, and even the band were surprised just how fast they were snapped up.</p>
      <p>Harry Judd told Metro.co.uk: ‘I was kind of thinking okay, maybe the first day we’ll sell maybe four or five thousand and then we’ve got a couple of big TV appearances to promote it. Maybe we’ll do a couple thousand off the back of that.</p>

      <p>‘And then nine o’clock they went on sale, and our manager was like “yeah guys, it’s sold out straight away”.</p>
      <p>‘It put a big smile on our faces. I think also it made us kind of think “Ok, sweet, that’s good. That’s confirmation we can do this.”’</p>
      <p>The band may not have been actively touring together for the past few years, but when they got back to rehearsals for the show and<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/mcfly-looking-to-billie-eilish-for-green-gig-inspiration-ahead-of-reunion-tour-10957882/"> the 2020 arena tour they’ve since announced</a>, it was just like old times.</p>

      <p>Tom Fletcher explained:<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/10/mcfly-admit-lost-touch-hiatus-magic-back-embark-comeback-10718223/"> ‘It’s been like no time has gone by whatsoever.</a> Literally from day one it’s felt like there hasn’t been any gap or any pause, we were just straight back into the old ways.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been really fun trying to remember how to play our instruments and how to play with the old songs and then working out the new ones, so it’s been really great.’</p>
      <p>Life on the road is pretty different for the band, comprised of Harry, Tom, Danny Jones and Dougie Poynter, than it was last time around, now most of the band have children of their own.</p>
      <p>However, much of the core team that works on the tour with them have remained the same since they started out over 15 years ago.</p>

      <p>The stereotype of tour life might be all about the partying, but Tom admits the band have a different perspective this time around.</p>

      <p>He explained: ‘As you get older you realise that the bits of touring that everyone assumes are the fun bits, aren’t actually the fun bits.</p>
      <p>‘It’s actually like, the mundane stuff about touring that’s the amazing bit, and we’ve had the same crew for 15 years, some of them have been with us the whole time.</p>
      <p>‘So when we get together to go on tour, it’s not just our family, it’s the extended family of the band and the people that work with us. It’s an amazing family that goes on the road, so it is really special.’</p>

      <p>Tom added: ‘I think we enjoy it more, not that we ever took it for granted, but this time we really understand the band means to us and how much we miss it when it’s not there and, and what a privilege it is to be able to tour and be a band still after all these years that are playing arenas and that there’s that many people that still want to come to see us play.</p>
      <p>‘There’s only a handful of bands that can do that and we are so fortunate to be one of them. So I think we were extremely lucky and I think we’ll try and make the most of every single second that we’re on stage.’</p>

      <p>The McFly fanbase have stuck with the band from the beginning, and the boys are always appreciative of the people that love their music.</p>
      <p>Being back on the promo tour for the upcoming shows, they’ve got to see a lot of them face to face again, and find out what impact their music has had on their fans.</p>

      <p>Harry explained: ‘It’s been amazing speaking to loads of fans online, over social media and at promo things we’ve been doing, and they’re all really excited.</p>
      <p>‘You get to see how much it means to them and hear all these different stories and they send us photos of them when they were like eight years old seeing us at Wembley in 2010 and 2005 and they’re like “it’s 2019 I’m 27 and I’m still going to see my favourite band”.</p>
      <p>‘It’s quite emotional when you start reading all those things and we’ve started to notice that the fans are growing up and what an impact you’ve made on their life, like there’s all these fans that are musicians now.</p>
      <p>‘When we first started we were 17 and all our fans were also teenagers and now a lot of them are in their 20s and 30s and have kids of their own too.’</p>
