      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andy-murray/">Andy Murray</a> revealed his marriage to wife Kim Sears was ‘strained’ following his hip injury.</p>
      <p>The tennis ace was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/11/tearful-andy-murray-considers-retiring-australian-open-will-end-career-2019-8332560/">forced to undergo a ‘life-changing’ operation at the beginning of the year</a>, in an attempt to prolong his career.</p>
      <p>And, lifting the lid on his journey back to health, the 32-year-old admitted it was a ‘tough period’ for his family as he became ‘quite selfish’.</p>
      <p>Speaking about ‘being down’, he explained: ‘It put a lot of strain on our relationship, just because I was down all the time.</p>
      <p>‘She [Kim] has been brilliant and I would probably be quite selfish, just in terms of thinking about myself and how I’m feeling all the time and not actually realising the impact that has on all the people around me.</p>
      <p>‘When everyone was trying to encourage me to keep going and keep trying and keep playing, I was, like, “You don’t know what it’s like. You don’t know what it is that I’m feeling”.’</p>

      <p>Andy and Kim tied the knot back in 2015, share daughters Sophia, Edie and newborn son Teddy – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/04/many-children-andy-murray-tennis-ace-welcomes-baby-boy-11037568/">whom they welcomed earlier this year</a>.</p>

      <p>And the Wimbledon winner revealed the surgery has changed his life, as he can play with his little ones properly.</p>
      <p>‘People say it all the time, but for me this was genuinely life-changing for all sorts of reasons, not just to play tennis, but when I’m crawling through a tunnel in soft play with my children, or just getting down on the floor to play and roll around with them,’ he told The Times.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t do that before. I couldn’t get the same enjoyment out of doing that with my children as I can now.’</p>
      <p>Andy previously opened up about adding to his family with Kim, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/andy-murray-reveals-babys-new-name-with-his-head-now-back-in-the-game-11085663/">confessing it has been ‘busy’ in the Murray household</a>.</p>

      <p>‘It’s been good. It’s just busy. We’ve got three under four now and two dogs so you’ve got to keep an eye out all the time but it’s been good, sleeping fine. Everyone’s healthy,’ he told reporters at his AMC clothing launch.</p>
      <p>‘This time has been really good actually. The first time when we went from one to two the first week or so was a bit I don’t know, a bit of jealousy.</p>
      <p>‘But this time they’ve been brilliant.’</p>

      <p>And he’s hoping that his brood will be able to watch him play tennis when they’re older.</p>
      <p>Which is fair enough.</p>
      <p>‘Selfishly I’d like for them to watch me play but ultimately it’s not that important,’ he added.</p>
      <p>‘Hopefully I can get a few more years out of my body and see what happens after that.’</p>
