      <h2>Jackson Lees' Emma Beckett discusses the importance of being prepared for the future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:38:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:38</time> by <a rel="author">Leena Sidat</a></address>
      <p>It's never too early to start thinking about creating a will, to ensure that the people under your care and closest to you are well looked after in the future, if you are no longer able to do this personally.</p>
      <p>Here, Emma Beckett, who has recently returned to Jackson Lees’ Wills, Trust, and Probate team, based at Exchange Flags in Liverpool's city centre, reflects on the importance of being prepared in order to protect someone else’s future. Now a mother, she discusses how parents and guardians, in particular, can benefit from having a will made.</p>
      <h3>Getting everything in order</h3>
      <p>I recently returned to work following a period of nine months’ maternity leave. Having a baby who completely depends on me has made me appreciate the importance of getting everything in order now more than ever.</p>
      <p>It is very difficult to comprehend a scenario where something happens to both my husband and me, but it has been essential for us to have a conversation about who might look after our son if we are no longer able to look after him ourselves.</p>
      <p>People often think they do not need to make a will until they are in their 60s or 70s, but it is very important to have a will if you have children under the age of 18.</p>
      <p>You may think there is no point in having a will if you do not have any savings or own any property. However, making a will is not just about deciding who you would like to leave money or possessions to.</p>

      <h3>So much more to a will</h3>
      <p>Your will can be used to choose who will look after your child should anything happen. In your will, you can nominate one or more people to care for your children if you are no longer able to do so yourself.</p>
      <p>These are known as ‘testamentary guardians’ and, if the clause in your will comes into effect, they will be granted parental responsibility for your children.</p>
      <p>Parental responsibility means that the guardian can make important decisions about the child’s life, for example, in relation to their medical treatment and education. Anyone caring for a child under the age of 18 on a permanent basis needs to have parental responsibility for them otherwise they will only have limited rights to do what is reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
      <p>If both parents of a child die without appointing guardians, only the court can appoint a guardian. Court proceedings can be costly and stressful and can be easily avoided by making a will.</p>
      <p>Once you have made a decision about who would be most appropriate to take on the role, it is important to discuss it with them and make sure they feel they would be able to care for your child on a long term basis.</p>
      <p>The thought of making a will can be daunting but Jackson Lees has a friendly, experienced team who will be able to provide you with peace of mind and reassurance.</p>
