      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>In morning, we discussed the chances of a breakdown in bitcoin below the $8,000 support area against the US Dollar. BTC made an attempt correct above the $8,150 resistance, but it failed to gain traction and remained well below the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>As a result, there was another bearish break below the $8,050 support. Moreover, morning’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/21/bitcoin-btc-price-hesitates-but-further-downsides-seem-likely/">bearish flag pattern</a> was breached with support near $8,080 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Finally, the price declined below the $8,000 support and the last swing low. A new monthly low was formed near $7,828 and the price is currently correcting higher.</p>
      <p>An immediate resistance for bitcoin is near the $7,920 level. It represents the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,221 high to $7,828 low. The first key resistance on the upside is near the $8,000 level (the recent breakdown support).</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $8,221 high to $7,828 low is near the $8,020 level to prevent gains. Lastly, there is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,020 on the same chart.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the price is likely to face a strong resistance if it corrects higher towards $8,000 and $8,020. A convincing break above the $8,020 resistance may perhaps lift the price towards the $8,200 resistance.</p>
      <p>On the downside, it seems like the gates for a test of the $7,400 support is now open (the next bearish target as discussed in the recent medium term outlook).</p>
