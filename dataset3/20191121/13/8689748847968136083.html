      <p>If you are struggling in certain areas of your life and you have no idea how to go about it, Well, worry no more as Versatile Radio and TV personality Abeiku Aggrey Santana has revealed three major keys to achieving your dreams.</p>
      <p>According to Abeiku Santana, success doesn’t depend on your level of education or the skills you have but rather your attitude.</p>

      <p>Your attitude towards work, your colleagues and people in general can either move you ahead in life and make you stagnant.</p>
      <p>Abeiku Santana took to his twitter page list what one can do to be successful and what goes into it.</p>
      <p>“How far you can go largely depends on your attitude and relationship with people. I define success with the acronym ASK,” he tweeted. Attitude = 60 %Skills = 25 % Knowledge = 15 %. Attitude is everything”. He wrote.</p>
      <p>We couldn’t agree more with Abeiku Santana’s list as many young unemployed people have lost their jobs as a result of their attitude. Showing lackadaisical attitude towards work will definitely get you kicked out. Most employees expect nothing but the perfection from their employees. After all you are getting paid so they need value for their money.</p>
      <p>Do you also agree with Abeiku’, assertions? Tell us in the comment session.</p>
