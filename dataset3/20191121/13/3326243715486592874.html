      <p>One of the more prominent supply partners for Apple over the years has been <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/japan-display/">Japan Display Inc</a>. It’s a company that isn’t a stranger to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2017/08/08/iphone-screen-supplier-japan-display-needs-cash-injection-to-switch-to-oleds/">money issues</a>, but one of its former executives took it to the extreme.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-display-corruption/apple-supplier-japan-display-says-executive-embezzled-5-25-million-idUSKBN1XU2VY"><i>Reuters</i></a>, Japan Display Inc. has formally dismissed an accounting executive at the company for embezzling $5.25 million over four years. The embezzling scheme has apparently gone on since the company went public back in 2014.</p>
      <p>JDI says that up to this point the company is cooperating with the local law enforcement, and that it has filed a criminal complaint against the former employee. The report indicates that the former executive embezzled 578 million yen ($5.3 million) between July 2014 and until October 2018.</p>
      <p>The unnamed executive was apparently arranging payments from JDI to a separate, fictitious company over the years.</p>
      <p>Japan Display is described as a cash-strapped company. It has recently reported its 11th consecutive quarterly net loss, courtesy of slow display sales and costs related to restructuring at the company. JDI is hoping to get a cash bailout from Apple in the near future, as the company tries to raise upwards of 50 billion yen to keep operations moving forward.</p>
      <p>Not great news for JDI by any means. Crazy how long it went on for.</p>
