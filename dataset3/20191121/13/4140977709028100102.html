            <b>: Rain continues to engulf today’s encounter between two sides who have found it impossible to veer clear of inclement weather.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Wherever Tshwane Spartans and Durban Heat have gone in South Africa, rain has stayed hot on their heels, refusing to leave them behind like a loyal dog. It’s been an unfortunate set of events for the two sides who have filed to veer clear of the impasse of floundering weather conditions and with rain in the air when these two meet today, the gripping narrative of widespread rainfall intervening is set to take centrestage once again.</p>
          <p>With both the sides seeing two of their three matches being truncated due to harsh, lashing rain, every match comes bearing with it immense ramifications for both the units. Having played the one full fledged affair till now, Tshwane Spartans managed to win that elusive tie to occupy third place in the points tally with the side’s incredible batting unit chasing down the gargantuan 186 laid out infront of them with 8 wickets in hand.</p>

              <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146">
                <p>Elsewhere, Durban Heat ended up winning their sole match which was not marred by rain with the side failing to preserve in their pursuit of 175. It was a defeat which came by the finest of margins as the side were halted by 10 runs as they folded out their run chase at 164, a performance they know they’ll need to work on if they are to have any chance of defeating a stellar opposition come today.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>Traditionally an extremely staunch wicket for the bats to come out and serenade a slew of runs their way, the massive likelihood of rain means that the bowlers will end up getting ample help as well, especially in the first part of the encounter. That paired with rain will lead the side winning the toss choosing to field first in a bid to make early headway into their opponent’s batting order.</p>

                            <h3>TST vs DUR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Whilst his 31 runs in a mere 13 balls were always going to be enough to warrant his selection, what really pushed us Heinrich Klaasen’s way as the wicket-keeper choice was the time of the match he got those runs in. It was an inning which came when the run-rate was ever increasing in magnitude for the outfit, a knock which ensured his side were able to cruise to a win with an over to spare.</p>
                            <h3>TST vs DUR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Stitching together a quirky and staunch 104 run opening partnership which laid down just the platform the side need as they looked to transpire successfully in their chase of 186 means both of Tshwane Spartans’ openers are going to be hammered down in our Dream 11 setup. Dean Elgar  ended up remaining unbeaten on 88 runs in just 60 balls whilst Theunis de Bruyn at the other end provided him with flawless support as he cantered his way to 42 runs.</p>
                            <p>AB de Villiers is someone who we just can’t leave out to see him complete the trivalent of picks from the outfit whilst from the opposition, we have decided to make Wihan Lubbe our first pick after his articulate and astounding knock of 83 in a mere 42 balls the last time around. Opener Alex Hales is someone who is a specialist T20 bat, seeing him come in as well to wrap up proceedings in this facet of our Dream 11 setup.</p>
                            <h3>TST vs DUR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>We are getting in the two all-rounders over with the one apiece representing us from either. With the chances of this match being run the scissors on as rain looms an eventually lashes, Andile Phehlukwayo is someone who offers solid value with the all-rounder bound to snare wickets and add to his two wicket tally from the last outing.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile we are moving in with the selection of spinner Roelof van de Merwe, someone whose slower brand of bowling will entice batsmen to go after him in a shortened clash as they look to up the ante for their side.</p>
                            <h3>TST vs DUR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Just the one pick for us from Tshwane Spartans as we opt for their new ball operator Tom Curran whilst from Durban Heat we have picked out spinner Keshav Maharaj and Kyle Abbot. It’s a seamless blend of function and grace, two instrumental and talismanic bowlers who’ll not only hold fort with their restrictive brand of bowling but also pick up wickets at regular intervals for the side.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Elgar comes out to captain our side while AB de Villiers is our vice-captain.</p>
