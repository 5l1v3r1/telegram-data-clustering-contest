      <p>Thom Evans got seriously flustered when he was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/nicole-scherzinger-x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-secretly-dating-weeks-texting-11170165/">questioned over those Nicole Scherzinger romance claims</a> – and it was absolutely not smooth.</p>
      <p>The pair are rumoured to have been getting closer during filming for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a>: Celebrity, with the pair spotted out on a romantic evening together.</p>
      <p>And the Try Star singer did nothing to discourage the rumourmill during an appearance on Loose Women, alongside bandmates Ben Goden and Levi Davis.</p>
      <p>When asked whether there was anything going on between himself and the Pussycat Doll favourite, he instantly became flustered as he stumbled over his words.</p>

      <p>‘Nicole is lovely and you know, I… But I’ve been concentrating on the bromance… And getting to the final,’ the 34-year-old told the panel who couldn’t contain their giggles over his denial.</p>
      <p>Smooth, hun.</p>
      <p>‘Who wouldn’t want to date Nicole? She’s lovely and, ermmmm…’</p>

      <p>Saving his bandmate, Ben jumped in to reply: ‘And who wouldn’t want to date Thom? Because he’s lovely.’</p>
      <p>While Levi added: ‘Look at him’.</p>
      <p>An insider recently claimed the rugby player was completely smitten with the ITV judge, and plucked up the courage to ask her out this week.</p>
      <p>‘Thom is completely Nicole’s type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he’s always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world,’ an insider claimed to The Sun.</p>

      <p>‘He fancied her long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, but they had great chemistry from the off.</p>
      <p>‘And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner.’</p>
      <p>Thom was a little more sure of himself when discussing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/thom-evans-claps-back-louis-walsh-x-factor-celebrity-twitter-loving-11072923/">his clapback to Louis Walsh on the latest X Factor instalment</a>, after himself and Ben were branded ‘backing singers’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Speaking about calling the music manager Simon Cowell’s backing singer, he admitted: ‘I can’t even believe I said that, to be honest.</p>
      <p>‘We put so much time and effort into dance choreography, to the vocals… Then we had our song changed on the Friday back to No Diggity from an Ed Sheeran song.</p>
      <p>‘It was the combination of all of that hard work for Louis to say we’re backing singers…’</p>
      <p>Bring on this weekend’s X Factor: Celebrity semi-final…</p>
