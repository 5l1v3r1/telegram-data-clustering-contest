      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/ben-askren">Ben Askren</a> had the biggest "what if" questions answered when he joined the UFC and had an active 2019, beating <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/robbie-lawler">Robbie Lawler</a> controversially within a round before suffering a famous 5-second knockout at the hands of <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jorge-masvidal">Jorge Masvidal</a> in July.</p>
      <p>He had a solid fight against Demian Maia in the main event of UFC Fight Night: Singapore but was submitted in the third round. In November, Askren went on to announce his retirement from MMA.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest aspects that drew fans to him was the way he spoke and his charismatic personality. Many believe that Askren would make a perfect pundit and be great for commentary and from the sound of things, it's an idea he's open to trying. Speaking to <i>TMZ </i>(H/T Credits <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/ben-askren-wants-to-give-television-commentary-a-try">BJPenn.com</a>), Askren said:</p>
      <blockquote>“I think there’s a chance. I think I’m going to give it a try. I’ve got a lot of people encouraging me to give it a try. I’m going to give it a try. I’m still not sure if I’m going to like it or not. I’m up for debate on that.”</blockquote>
      <p>Former fighters transitioning into commentary has worked out well in the past and even today in the UFC, we have the likes of Daniel Cormier, Dominick Cruz, Michael Bisping, Dan Hardy, and even Paul Felder taking up jobs in the commentary booth.</p>
      <p>It's certainly a great option for fighters who are comfortable on the mic and that's an aspect Askren is well-versed with. He'll undoubtedly be right in the mix if he takes the job and will continue to remain in the public eye.</p>
      <p>While his run in the UFC may not have lived up to expectations, his fights were certainly entertaining. Hopefully, he has a great post-fight career as well.</p>
