      <p>Two persons died in West Bengal's Coochbehar after they were allegedly beaten up by a mob over a suspicion of cattle smuggling.</p>
      <p>The alleged lynching took place on Wednesday at Putimari Fuleswari village in Coochbehar.</p>
      <p>The locals spotted the two persons -- Bablu Milan and Prakash Das -- carrying cattle in a van. They were stopped and questioned. When the locals were not satisfied with the answers, they thrashed the two persons and even set their van on fire.</p>
      <p>Police from Kotwali police station rushed to the spot and rescued Bablu and Prakash. They were soon taken to a hospital but due to their serious condition, they succumbed to their injuries.</p>
      <p>An investigation has been launched into the matter.</p>
      <p>The incident comes to light just after the Bengal Assembly passed an anti-lynching legislation.</p>
