      <p>Confirmed: Samsung Galaxy S11 will have 25W fast charging and 5G connectivity<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Although the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S11 series will not be official until February, next year. It is surprising the number of leaks, rumors and information that we are seeing regarding these models. For example, yesterday we learned that they would have a 120 Hz screen refresh rate. Today we see how this same device has passed through the Chinese CCC (or 3C) certification. Thus revealing key features of this phone, such as its fast charge and its connectivity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Samsung">Samsung</a> has never been categorized for having the best fast charging on the market, but with the Galaxy Note 10, it introduced the 25W (charger included, because the S10 were compatible but without an included charger) and even the 45W for the Note 10+ if we bought the right charger. With this in mind, we expected the Samsung Galaxy S11 to be the same. But it seems that it will not be so and that we will have a charging with less power.</p>
      <h3>It is confirmed that the Samsung Galaxy S11 will have 5G connectivity</h3>

      <p>We already brought you a leak on the Samsung Galaxy S11 that confirmed that we would have up to five different versions of these phones. Combining the 5G and 4G versions (the largest model will only be available in 5G version). We can confirm this again after the passage of one of these devices through this certification body. Which has accredited it as a mobile device with 5G connectivity. It’s something we expected for this year 2020, but it’s not bad to know.</p>
      <p>Another of the characteristics that this <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-gets-certified-with-5g-and-25w-charging-support/">certification</a> shows us, is the load power that this terminal will support. In the section where we read model specifications. We can see that at most it will support 9V at 2.77A. Which translates into 25W of charging power. It seems that Samsung’s 45W is reserved for the Galaxy Note 10+ or ​​for the top model of these Samsung Galaxy S11.</p>
      <p>By the way, we know that it is the Samsung Galaxy S11 by the code name given to the phone SM-G9860. And with these details, along with previous leaks, the truth is that we can imagine how Samsung’s next flagship will be. Which already aims to be the best in the market months before being presented.</p>
