        <b>Former Netherlands star Wesley Sneijder believes he could have been mentioned in the same breath as <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/10-years-on-when-tallaght-stadium-welcomed-real-newboy-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> and Lionel Messi had he been more committed.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Ajax, Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Galatasary and Nice star retired back in August finishing his career with a short-spell in Qatar with Al-Gharafa.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old won domestic titles in five different countries as well as the Champions League over the course of his career.</p>
      <p>His best season arguably came in 2010 when he was nominated for the Ballon d’Or after Inter Milan’s successful run in Europe followed by the Netherlands run to the World Cup final.</p>

      <p>He finished fourth in the voting behind eventual winner Lionel Messi who took home the gong ahead of teammates Andres Iniesta and Xavi.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sneijder10official/?hl=en">Sneijder</a> sat down with Fox Sports NL earlier this week and when reflecting on his career the Dutch midfielder claimed he could have been mentioned in the same breath as Messi and Ronaldo if not for his commitment levels.</p>
      <p>“I have to be honest and admit that I could have been mentioned in the same breath as Messi and Ronaldo if I had been 100% committed. I know that,” Sneijder told Fox Sports NL.</p>
      <p>“But I did not want to do that and I have no regrets about it. It’s not that I didn’t have it in me, but I simply didn’t want to do it.</p>

      <p>“I enjoyed my footballing career as it was, both on and off the pitch. I won every trophy I could win at club level, so I have no regrets at all. I am a team player and I like to be successful as a team.</p>
      <p>“People still approach me to tell me that they feel I should have won the Ballon d’Or in 2010, but I keep telling them that winning the Champions League was nicer than an individual trophy.</p>
      <p>“Of course, it would have been the icing on the cake, but it’s satisfying enough that people tell me I should have won it.”</p>
