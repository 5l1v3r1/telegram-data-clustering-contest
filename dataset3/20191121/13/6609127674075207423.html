        <b>TIGER WOODS' ex-wife's incredible Florida mansion has just had its price slashed - and could be yours for £34.4MILLION.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, even with £3.9m taken off, Elin Nordegren's palatial home costs an absolute fortune - although not as much as her former husband's.</p>

      <p>And it's easy to see why.</p>
      <p>The Swedish model and former nanny, 39, was rumoured to have got a £77m payoff when she divorced Woods, 43, in 2010 after he admitted cheating with dozens of women and checked himself into rehab for sex addiction.</p>
      <p>Nordegren splashed some of that cash on the 25,878sq ft oceanfront home in North Palm Beach, Florida, an exclusive area loved by multi-millionaires.</p>
      <p>Bought in 2014, the mansion comes with 11 bedrooms, 15 bathrooms, three half bathrooms and breathtaking ocean views.</p>
      <p>The masters bedroom boasts his and hers bathrooms, walk-in wardrobe, THREE fireplaces and a balcony to look out over the Atlantic.</p>
      <p>Got guests over? No problem. All four of the guest bedrooms have en-suites and walk-in closets.</p>
      <p>The stunning outdoor pool - with slide and spa - sits before a lush garden that leads down to the beach.</p>
      <p>One of the most amazing features is the three-storey Swarovski crystal chandelier that lights up the staircase.</p>
      <p>And there is a gym, lounge area with impressive fire pits, half basketball court and a putting green set inside the 1.4 acre estate.</p>

      <p>The wine cellar is perfect for when you get a bit thirsty and you can watch a film in the plush home cinema.</p>
      <p>A four-car garage means there is plenty of room for visitors - who can stay in a guesthouse which boats two, two-bedroom apartments.</p>
      <p>Woods, who will captain America in next month's Presidents Cup in Australia, and Elin have two children together, daughter Sam, 12, and son Charlie, 10.</p>
      <p>Their marriage imploded when Woods - who now dates Erica Herman - crashed his car into a fire hydrant outside their Orlando home on Thanksgiving 2009.</p>
      <p>Nordegren - who last month had a child with NFL star Jordan Cameron - was alleged to have smashed the back window of his SUV open with a 9-iron after she chased him out the house.</p>
      <p>The couple - who married in a private Bahamas ceremony in 2004 - divorced around six months later when the scale of the golfing legend's cheating became clear.</p>
      <p>Several women including porn stars, pancake house waitresses and Las Vegas party girls came forward to say they had slept with the 15-time Major champion.</p>
      <p>Woods went public with Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn in 2013 before she announced their break-up three years later.</p>
      <p>The 15-time Major champion would hit rock bottom in 2017 when he was arrested for driving under the influence.</p>
      <p>But he reached the top of the golfing world back in April when he completed arguably sport's greatest ever comeback by winning The Masters.</p>
