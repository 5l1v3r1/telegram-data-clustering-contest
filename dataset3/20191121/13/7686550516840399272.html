      <h1>The Tories have created a bogus website called labourmanifesto.co.uk and are using it to attack Jeremy Corbyn</h1>
      <h2>The fake website is appearing at the top of many people's Google search results</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:06:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:06</time> by <a rel="author">Marcus Hughes</a></address>
      <p>The Conservative Party have bought a website called "labourmanifesto.co.uk" and are using it to attack the opponent party on the day of their manifesto launch.</p>
      <p>The website, which some commentators suggest may appear to be an official Labour Party domain, has appeared at the top of some people's Google search results as a paid advertisement.</p>
      <p>But the content of the site contains criticisms and smears on Labour policies related to Brexit and tax reform.</p>
      <p>The website opens on a single page with an unflattering image of Jeremy Corbyn captioned "Labour's 2019 Manifesto".</p>
      <p>Below that it reads: "A website by the Conservative Party" followed by "no plan for Brexit", "higher taxes" and "two more referendums".</p>
      <p>The whois.net website shows that the domain name labourmanifesto.co.uk was bought on Monday this week.</p>
      <p>The Labour Party <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/green-party-manifesto-election-2020-17285467">launched its General Election manifesto on Thursday morning.</a></p>
      <p>The document includes plans for a windfall tax on oil firms, a pledge to make the UK carbon neutral by 2030, and promises to scrap tuition fees and introduce a "real living wage" of at least £10 an hour.</p>

      <p>A WalesOnline reporter entered the search term "labour" into the Google search engine shortly after the official launch of the Labour Party manifesto.</p>
      <p>The top result, appearing as an advertisement, listed the Conservative-run site along with the line "£2,400 More Tax, Every Year".</p>
      <p>Commentators writing on Twitter have suggested the website may be misleading potential voters.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Conservative Party were widely citicised for changing the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/general-election-twitter-fact-check-17284315">name of their communication HQ Twiitter handle to "factcheck UK" during Tuesday's televised debate</a> .</p>
