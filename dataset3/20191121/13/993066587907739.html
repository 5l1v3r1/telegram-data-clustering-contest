      <h1>16 people found alive in sealed container on ferry to Rosslare</h1>

      <p>A LORRY has been seized in Co Wexford after 16 men were found alive in a sealed trailer on a ferry bound for the Republic.</p>
      <p>The lorry driver and the owners of the articulated vehicle are helping gardaí with their enquiries after the 16 men were discovered as the Stena Line ferry was travelling from Cherbourg in France to Rosslare Europort in Co Wexford.</p>
      <p>The men, aged between 20 and 40, were found at around 9.45am today - more than 12 hours after the ferry left Cherbourg.</p>
      <p>A Stena Line staff member making a routine check of the vehicle deck is understood to have heard banging from inside the trailer, which was on the back of a lorry.</p>
      <p>It is thought the lorry is owned by a freight firm based in Co Wexford.</p>
      <p>The migrants' nationalities are not yet known, however, they have believed to have told staff they are from a country in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>The group were brought to a passenger lounge and given hot food and drinks. It is believed they had travelled from Belgium up to five days ago.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said the men "appear in good health".</p>
      <p>The ship docked at Rosslare at around 3pm where it was met by gardaí and other emergency services.</p>
      <p>A Garda spokesman said the men underwent medical assessments at Rosslare Port. He said the force is investigating potential breaches of immigration law.</p>
      <p>"Garda Immigration Officers attached to Wexford Garda Station, supported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) will carry out an assessment on the immigration status of all the persons," a spokesman said.</p>
      <p>He said the lorry had been seized.</p>
      <p>“The driver and the owners of the articulated vehicle are assisting An Garda Síochána with our enquiries," he said.</p>
      <p>Ian Hampton, Stena Line’s chief people &amp; communications officer, said yesterday morning: "During the Stena Horizon’s 21:00 hrs sailing from Cherbourg France to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck."</p>
      <p>"All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees," he said.</p>
      <p>"Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel’s arrival in Rosslare."</p>
      <p>Tánaiste Simon Coveney told the Dáil today: "This is criminal activity which doesn't respect borders."</p>
      <p>He said gardaí will work closely with police services across the EU to deal with the suspected trafficking of the 16 men.</p>
      <p>The find comes just weeks after 39 Vietnamese migrants were discovered in the back of a sealed refrigerated container in an Essex industrial estate.</p>
      <p>The bodies of 31 men and eight women were found in the early hours of October 23.</p>
      <p>Mo Robinson (25), of Laurelvale, Co Armagh, has already appeared in court in England to face charges including 39 counts of manslaughter.</p>
      <p>Essex Police have also started extradition proceedings to bring 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, from Mayobridge in Co Down, to the UK.</p>
      <p>Three other people - a 38-year-old man, a 38-year-old woman, and a 46 year-old man - have been arrested in connection with the investigation.</p>
