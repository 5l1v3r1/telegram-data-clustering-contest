      <p>The Labour Party took aim at gig-economy companies such as Uber and Deliveroo, as it pledged to end “bogus self-employment”.</p>
      <p>The companies, and others who rely on self-employed workers, could face serious challenges under Labour’s new proposal to ban anyone from claiming to be self-employed unless they work for their own business.</p>
      <p>In its manifesto pledge on Thursday, the party pledged it would end “bogus self-employment and create a single status of ‘worker’ for everyone apart from those genuinely self-employed in business on their own account”.</p>
      <p>This, Labour said, would ensure “employers cannot evade workers’ rights”.</p>
      <p>The gig economy has come under pressure in recent years as workers try to extract rights from their employers.</p>
      <p>Companies like Deliveroo and Uber have argued their delivery and taxi drivers are not regular members of staff, meaning they do not qualify for pensions and holiday pay.</p>
      <p>Last December the Court of Appeal ruled against Uber’s classification of its drivers as independent contractors rather than workers, in a case brought by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).<br/>Employment lawyer Ross Meadows at Oury Clark said that courts have already forced companies to provide some minimum rights to their workers, including holiday pay and sick pay.</p>
      <p>“The cases that have gone before the courts have basically said they should be entitled to worker status,” he said.</p>
      <p>He warned that Uber and other companies may consider withdrawing from the UK if they find the new rules too strict.</p>
      <p>But Jason Moyer-Lee, general secretary of the IWGB union, dismissed claims that Uber might leave, pointing to legislation in New York and California which had imposed stricter rules.</p>
      <p>He told the PA news agency that Labour’s manifesto included the two main policies his union had pushed for – enforcement of court decisions and extension of employment rights to workers from their first day in the job.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Thursday said: “How can any government claim it cares about our country when it cares so little about the people who live here?</p>
      <p>“No-one can deny the thirst for real change in Britain. I believe that was a driving force behind the EU referendum vote in 2016.”</p>
      <p>Uber and Deliveroo did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
