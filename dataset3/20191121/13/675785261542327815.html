      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:20:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:20</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Collings</a></address>
      <p>A torture victim who was stabbed and beaten accepted he was going to die before dramatically escaping.</p>
      <p>Over the course of 11 hours David Pattinson, 37, and Arthur Collin, 49 held their victim captive and subjected him to brutal beatings.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was kept at Pattinson's house in Berwick-upon,Tweed, Northumberland, where he was repeatedly assaulted.</p>
      <p>He only managed to escape when the men tried to move him to another location, allowing the victim to flee on foot before flagging down a passing bus, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/david-pattinson-arthur-collin-torture-17291980">Chronicle Live reported.</a></p>
      <p>“I had actually given up on my life at that point in the night and accepted I was going to die," the victim said.</p>

      <p>“What makes this whole event worse is the fact Pattinson and Collin have never admitted their guilt and they have made me go to court and relive the whole experience again.”</p>
      <p>Newcastle Crown Court heard how in April their victim had attended Pattinson's home in the late evening.</p>
      <p>Shortly after Pattinson 'flipped', locking doors of his home and restraining the man in a chair.</p>
      <p>Over the following hours Pattinson, later joined by his friend Collin, tortured their victim: jabbing him in the face with a knife, stabbing him with a screwdriver, beating him and strangling him into unconsciousness.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The duo also forced the man to contact his friends by phone and tell them that he was going to die.</p>
      <p>Claire Wright of the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Pattinson was seemingly motivated by financial pressures and difficulties over access to his children, for which he inexplicably blamed the victim.</p>
      <p>"Collin’s motivation is less clear but he travelled from his home nearly ten miles away to join Pattinson in torturing the man.</p>
      <p>"It is difficult to imagine how terrifying this experience must have been."</p>
      <p>Following Pattinson and Collin's sentencing on Wednesday, police released images of the victim's blood stained clothes which were found in a wheelie bin.</p>

      <p>A hammer was also recovered from the crime scene.</p>
      <p>Three weeks before the kidnapping, Pattinson had assaulted another man at his address.</p>
      <p>On that occasion the 34-year-old victim fled the scene with no shoes on.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Anthony Murray, one of the leading officers on the investigation, said: “I’ve dealt with some particularly nasty and violent cases during my career as a police officer but this has been one of the worst.</p>
      <p>“Pattinson and Collin are two incredibly dangerous offenders who are now safely off our streets.</p>
      <p>"However, the physical and mental trauma suffered by the victims will live with them their whole life.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“Hopefully, knowing they are behind bars will bring some comfort to the victims and I want to thank him for his bravery and dedication during this incredibly difficult investigation and trial.”</p>
      <p>During the investigation Pattinson and Collin claimed their victim had attended the home voluntarily, before inflicting serious injuries upon himself.</p>
      <p>Det Con Murray added: "By piecing together medical evidence and mobile phone data the Crown Prosecution Service has dismantled that false narrative to deliver today’s sentences, in which we sincerely hope the victims of his violent offending can find some measure of comfort."</p>

      <p>Pattinson, of Braeside, Berwick, was found guilty by a jury and was sentenced to a total of 20 years for his crimes – 15 years for assault, false imprisonment, threats to kill and possession of class A drugs with intent to supply and five years to run consecutively for the assault three weeks prior.</p>
      <p>Collin, of Hurkur Crescent, Eyemouth, Scotland, was found guilty of assault and false imprisonment and was sentenced to a total of 14 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>DC Murray added: “Our investigation team are delighted with the result and I want to thank everyone on the team for their hard work on this case.</p>
      <p>“I think we all hope we don’t come across another sickening and violent case such as this anytime soon.”</p>
