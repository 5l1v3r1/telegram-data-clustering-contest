      <h1>Disney says that despite Disney+ hacked accounts, there's no evidence of a security breach</h1>
      <h2>Reused credentials and keyloggers may have been responsible</h2>

      <h4>A hot potato: The launch of a streaming service with over 10 million customers was always likely to have some problems, and Disney+ was no exception. In addition to the technical problems it experienced, there were also reports of thousands of accounts being hacked and stolen, but the company insists it never suffered a breach.</h4>
      <p>On launch day, Twitter and Reddit were swamped with users <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82804-hacked-disney-accounts-sold-dark-web.html">reporting</a> that their passwords had been changed and they’d been logged out of all devices. Account credentials appeared on the dark web’s hacking forums, with prices ranging from $3 to $7, though some were offered for free, as Disney+ allows account sharing.</p>
      <p>Disney, however, says it wasn’t hacked. “We have found no evidence of a security breach,” a rep said in a statement to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/disney-plus-accounts-hacked-security-breach-1203410376/">Variety</a>. “We continuously audit our security systems and when we find an attempted suspicious login we proactively lock the associated user account and direct the user to select a new password.”</p>
      <p>Some affected users did admit to reusing credentials from other accounts, which could be how the hackers accessed them, but there were customers who insisted they used unique passwords.</p>
      <p>Hackers could have gained access by trying credentials leaked from other sites, or they could have used keyloggers. As Disney noted: “Billions of usernames and passwords leaked from previous breaches at other companies, pre-dating the launch of Disney+, are being sold on the web.”</p>
      <p>Disney said only a small percentage of Disney+ customers have reported their accounts being hacked, and it urges anyone who believes they’ve been compromised to contact its customer services.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, Disney exec Kevin Mayer said the Disney+ launch’s problems were to do with the way it <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/82851-disney-app-architecture-caused-disney-launch-day-problems.html">architected the app</a>, and nothing to do with Amazon or other third parties. It appears the company wasn’t expecting such a large demand.</p>
