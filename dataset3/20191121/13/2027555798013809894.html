      <h1>IFFI 2019: Rahul Rawail, others booed at</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:23:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/roshan-h-nair" target="_blank">Roshan H Nair</a></address>
      <p>The inauguration of the Indian Panorama section on Thursday did not go smoothly as expected.</p>
      <p>It was announced that the event, which will see the felicitation of members of the jury, will also screen the movie 'Nooreh' by Ashish Pandey later.</p>
      <p>The event, which was supposed to start at 11 am, did not. The organisers delayed the ceremony by half-an-hour waiting for some members of the jury.</p>
      <p>Since the delegates had been let in at 10.30 itself, many of them had to wait there for an hour with little happening. Then they erupted in protest.</p>
      <p>"Disgusting, utterly disgusting," one woman sneered at the emcees from the back. "We are not here to see you. We just want to watch the movie," another delegate said.<br/>"We have been late since 1947," a man in front said.</p>
      <p>Finally, when the expected jury members arrived, one of whom was reputed Hindi filmmaker Rahul Rawail, the audience booed loudly and gave a round of mock applause.<br/> </p>
