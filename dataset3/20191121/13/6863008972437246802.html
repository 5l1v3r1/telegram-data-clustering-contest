      <p>A citizen of the Republic of Lithuania who has been on the FBI's international wanted list and was earlier detained in the capital city of Kyiv has been extradited to the United States under a fast-track procedure.</p>
      <p>"The Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office has decided to extradite the person to the United States under a simplified procedure and today he has actually been transferred to that country's authorities. This example of cooperation is unique, since this is the first fast-track extradition from Ukraine to the United States," according to the PGO's press service.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, the man is suspected of embezzlement of US$6 million from U.S. financial institutions' accounts, stealing personal data, and money laundering. He was detained in a Kyiv-based hotel where he was staying. Realizing it is impossible to escape extradition to the United States, the suspect agreed to the simplified procedure.</p>
