      <p><b>BAGHDAD —</b> Two protesters were killed and dozens wounded in overnight clashes with security forces in Iraq's capital Baghdad, security and medical sources said on Thursday.<br/><br/>Anti-government demonstrators have spread out from their main protest camp on Tahrir (Liberation) Square onto three bridges linking the two banks of the river Tigris.<br/><br/>Security forces have erected concrete barriers on the bridges to hold protesters back, and late on Wednesday they fired tear gas and live ammunition at crowds gathering on the Al-Sinek and Al-Ahrar bridges.<br/><br/>One protester was shot dead by a live round and another died from a trauma wound sustained by a tear gas canister.<br/><br/>Rights groups have slammed security forces for firing the military-grade gas grenades directly at protesters instead of up in the air.<br/><br/>When shot at close range, the canisters can pierce demonstrators' skulls or chest, and advocacy groups have documented around two dozen such deaths.<br/><br/>The overnight confrontation also injured more than 50 people, including at least six who sustained gunshot wounds.<br/><br/>Authorities fear crowds could use the Al-Sinek bridge to reach the Iranian embassy in Baghdad and cross the adjacent Al-Ahrar bridge, further north, to protest at the Central Bank and other government buildings.<br/><br/>Protesters in Tahrir have slammed Tehran for propping up an Iraqi government they see as corrupt and inefficient, even accusing it of backing the use of violence against them.<br/><br/>More than 330 people have been killed since the protests broke out on Oct. 1, according to an AFP toll, as authorities have stopped providing updated or precise figures. — AFP</p>
