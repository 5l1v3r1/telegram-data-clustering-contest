        <b>UPDATE: 1:40 p.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kelowna Mayor Colin Basran says the City of Kelowna could realize an economic benefit of between $8 million and $15 million by hosting the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier.</p>
      <p>It's anticipated the 2021 Brier, which will be held March 6 to 14, will attract more than 4,300 curling fans from outside the city.</p>
      <p>The 2021 Brier is just one of several international sporting events in the city over an 18 month period.</p>
      <p>Those include last month's Skate Canada International, the world mixed and senior curling championships coming in April, plus the Memorial Cup in May.</p>
      <p>Basran says the national and international television exposure for the city is priceless.</p>
      <p>The city contributed $200,000 toward the bid to host the Brier.</p>
      <p>Those funds, says Basran, comes from a yearly fund designed specifically to assist with bids such as these.</p>
      <p>When the first stone is thrown, it will have been 53 years since the Brier was last held in Kelowna, at Memorial Arena.</p>
      <p>Rick Sawatsky, who has lived in Kelowna since 2000, has curled in eight Brier's, throwing lead rocks for Jim Cotter's hybrid Vernon-Kelowna rink.</p>
      <p>"The thought of being able to represent B.C. and compete for a national championship in my home town would be a pretty special experience for sure," said Sawatsky.</p>
      <p>"Not only for us as athletes, but for our friends and family, and people that support and follow our team up and down this valley. It would be phenomenal.</p>
      <p>Sawatsky said he didn't ever think this day would come.</p>
      <p>"Kudos to Jock (Tyre) and his team for going through with it.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be an amazing event."</p>
      <p>Ticket packages are expected to go on sale early next year.</p>

        <b>UPDATE: 11:45 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kelowna will host the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier.</p>
      <p>Curling Canada officials made the announcement Thursday at Prospera Place.</p>
      <p>Kelowna last hosted the Canadian Men’s Curling Championship in 1968, when Alberta’s Ron Northcott prevailed at Memorial Arena.</p>
      <p>This time around, the nation's best men’s curling teams will go head to head at Prospera Place March 6-14, 2021.</p>
      <p>“Kelowna put together a superb bid to host the Tim Hortons Brier in 2021,” said John Shea, chair of Curling Canada’s board of governors. “The Okanagan region has hosted numerous top-calibre curling events in the past, and I know the City of Kelowna is ready to step up and put on an amazing show for the world's most famous national curling championship.”</p>
      <p>“Kelowna is very excited to host the 2021 Tim Hortons Brier, and we thank Curling Canada for the opportunity to do so,” said Mayor Colin Basran. </p>
      <p>Kelowna previously hosted the 1986 World Women’s Championship, 1989 Scotties Tournament of Hearts, 1999 Canadian Junior Championships, 2002 World Junior Championships, and, most recently, the World Mixed Curling Championship in 2018.</p>
      <p>Tickets are expected to go on sale early in 2020.</p>
      <p>This year's Brier will be held Feb. 29-March 8 in Kingston, Ont. </p>
