      <h1>The Android 10 update seems to be breaking Wi-Fi on some Pixel 2 devices</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:16:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/damien9to5/" target="_blank">Damien Wilde</a></address>
      <p>The full Android 10 update has been available for the Pixel 2 and 2 XL for a little while but it appears as though it has broken Wi-Fi functionality and created other issues for some people.</p>
      <p>An extensive <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/13670154?hl=en#">Google Support thread</a> has quite a sizeable number of reports from disgruntled Pixel 2 owners complaining that since updating to Android 10, Wi-Fi has simply stopped working correctly (via <i><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-10-google-pixel-2-wi-fi-issues-1056743/">Android Authority</a></i>).</p>
      <p>Weirder still, no two reports have the exact same issue. It varies from case to case. There are some people that state they are able to connect to Wi-Fi networks with their Pixel 2, but then have no internet access available. Meanwhile, some are unable to connect to Wi-Fi consistently and experience drop-outs, get kicked off, and generally have a bad time.</p>
      <p>Bluetooth also seems to be affected, with the Android 10 update seemingly rendering connections inconsistent.</p>

      <p>For many, the only solution has been a factory reset and downgrade to Android 9 Pie. Where that hasn’t been possible, Google has sent out replacements running Pie to people without the means to restore and downgrade their device. Even a factory reset isn’t a guarantee that it will fix the Wi-Fi issue on your Pixel 2 — should you have connectivity problems.</p>
      <p>Google has yet to officially respond to the complaints, but we have reached out for a comment and will update should we get an official response. Have you encountered Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connectivity issues with your Pixel 2 or 2 XL since updating to Android 10? Have you managed to resolve the problems? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
