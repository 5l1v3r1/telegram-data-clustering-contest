      <h1>How Inter Milan could line up against Torino</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/inter-milan/"><b>Inter Milan</b></a>'s pursuit of Serie A leaders Juventus will continue away to Torino on Saturday night.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:04:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:04</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Law</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-conte/"><b>Antonio Conte</b></a>'s side are currently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/serie-a/table.html">second in Italy's top flight</a>, one point behind Juve heading into the next set of fixtures.</p>
      <p>The Milan giants have won 10, drawn one and lost one off their 12 league matches this season and will be looking to pick up another three points in Turin this weekend.</p>
      <p>Inter recorded a 2-1 victory over Hellas Verona in their last match before the international break, while they have won all six of their away fixtures in the league during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how Conte's side could line up on Saturday night.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matteo-politano/"><b>Matteo Politano</b></a> (ankle), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alexis-sanchez/"><b>Alexis Sanchez</b></a> (ankle)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alessandro-bastoni/"><b>Alessandro Bastoni</b></a> (foot)</p>
      <p>On-loan Manchester United attacker Alexis Sanchez is still on the sidelines with an ankle problem, while Matteo Politano is also expected to miss out for the Milan giants on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Alessandro Bastoni is the only other slight doubt, though, meaning that Conte has a strong squad to choose from heading into what is a very important fixture.</p>
      <p>Neither <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-candreva/"><b>Antonio Candreva</b></a> nor <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-godin/"><b>Diego Godin</b></a> were in the starting XI against Verona before the international break but the pair should return for this match.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lautaro-martinez/"><b>Lautaro Martinez</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/romelu-lukaku/"><b>Romelu Lukaku</b></a> are certain to continue in the final third, while the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcelo-brozovic/"><b>Marcelo Brozovic</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefan-de-vrij/"><b>Stefan de Vrij</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/milan-skriniar/"><b>Milan Skriniar</b></a> will surely feature.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the main talking point surrounds the potential inclusion of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefano-sensi/"><b>Stefano Sensi</b></a>, who was excellent in the early weeks of the campaign and has now recovered from his recent injury issues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/matias-vecino/"><b>Matias Vecino</b></a> has scored in his last two appearances for Inter, though, meaning that Conte has a huge decision to make when it comes to which player joins <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nicolo-barella/"><b>Nicolo Barella</b></a> and Brozovic in midfield.</p>
