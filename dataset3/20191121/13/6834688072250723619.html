      <p>Thought Machine, a company that builds cloud-native tech for banks, has partnered with Google Cloud, according to a note from the company. As a Google Cloud partner Thought Machine will work closely with the Google Cloud team on new opportunities around the world.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thoughtmachine.net/">Thought Machine</a> is the creator of “Vault” a cloud native alternative to the legacy banking platforms that plague the industry. Vault can implement the full range of banking products, according to the company.</p>
      <p>Vault also allows banks to experiment and offer its customers differentiated and personalised banking products.</p>
      <p>Paul Taylor, CEO and founder of Thought Machine, stated:</p>
      <blockquote>“Many of our clients have already selected Google Cloud to run Vault on, and today’s announcements deepens the relationship further. We are delighted with the collaboration already happening between Thought Machine, Google Cloud and our clients. What excites me most is the transformational effect this partnership will have on the banking industry.  It is time to consign the deficiencies of the legacy platforms to the past once and for all.”</blockquote>
      <p>Prior to founding Thought Machine, Taylor worked at Google leading an engineering team thus there is already a close relationship to the mega-tech firm.</p>
      <p>Derek Freel, Head of FinTech at UK/I – Google Cloud, said the partnership is exactly what they are looking for bringing next-gen software to the banking industry by combining the scale and global reach of Google Cloud.</p>
