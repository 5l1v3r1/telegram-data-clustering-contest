      <p>A funeral service has been held for the slain soldiers in Mali. The Defence Ministry held the service for the 30 soldiers in the city of Gao.</p>
      <p>The soldiers were killed this week during an attack on an army patrol by extremists near the border with Niger.</p>
      <p>Malian army spokesman said the toll rose from 24 to 30 from Mondayâ€™s mug.</p>
      <p>The deadly attack occured in Tabankort in the northeastern Gao region while soldiers from Mali and Niger were carrying out a joint operation to track extremists.</p>
      <p>Women held protests in Gao and Sikasso in the south on Wednesday to pressure the government to better protect soldiers.</p>
      <p>More than 100 Malian soldiers have died in the past two months in attacks by armed groups linked to organisations such as the Islamic State group and al-Qaida.</p>
