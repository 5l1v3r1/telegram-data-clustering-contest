      <p>Microsoft today announced the availability of Azure from new cloud datacenter regions in Norway. With the availability, Microsoft becomes the first major cloud provider in the region to deliver enterprise-grade cloud services. This new cloud region will be really helpful for Norwegian companies and organizations to meet their data residency, security, and compliance requirements. DNB, Equinor, Lånekassen, and Posten are some of the Azure customers taking advantage of this new cloud region launch. The new cloud regions in Norway will expand in 2020 with Office 365, Dynamics 365 and Power Platform support.</p>
      <blockquote>The new cloud regions in Norway connect with Microsoft’s 54 regions via our global network, one of the largest and most innovative on the planet, spanning more than 130,000 miles of terrestrial fiber and subsea cable systems to deliver services to customers. Microsoft brings the global cloud closer to home for Norwegian organizations and citizens through our transatlantic system Marea, the highest-capacity subsea cable to cross the Atlantic.</blockquote>
