      <p>The Queen is a fan of Tunnock’s teacakes, the inventor of the snack has revealed after receiving his knighthood at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>Sir Boyd Tunnock said she chose the teacake from the Scottish brand over the caramel wafer, which was created by his father.</p>
      <p>Sir Boyd, 86, who runs the family-owned business in Uddingston, South Lanarkshire, received his honour on Thursday for services to business and charity.</p>

      <p>Sir Boyd created the Tunnock’s teacake – marshmallow on a biscuit base coated in chocolate – in 1956.</p>
      <p>The caramel wafer, made up of five layers of wafer, four layers of caramel and fully coated in chocolate, was created by Sir Boyd’s father Archie in 1952.</p>

      <p>Describing the investiture ceremony, Sir Boyd said it was “excellent” and “awesome” to receive his honour from the Queen.</p>
      <p>“It was very regal,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The music was great, I was standing there swaying and I could have danced all night.</p>
      <p>“The Queen is so nice and makes you feel very relaxed.”</p>
