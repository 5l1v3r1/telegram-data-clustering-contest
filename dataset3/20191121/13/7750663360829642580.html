      <p>The Accies club captain has not started a game for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/brian-rice/"><b>Brian Rice</b></a>'s team since their Lanarkshire derby defeat in August.</p>
      <p>Sitting on the sidelines has been a bitter experience for the 34-year-old, who has been a first pick for the club ever since he made the step up from the junior ranks back in 2012.</p>
      <p>MacKinnon has seen before how a negative attitude can spread through a dressing room but is determined not to be the bad influence who rocks the boat and sends Accies – currently just a point above the relegation slots – down.</p>
      <p>He said: "It's been frustrating. I'm not used to it.</p>
      <p>"However, there is no point being a bad influence. The worst thing I could do for this club is walk about with my face tripping me. I'll support the boys because I don't want this club to go down. I'm captain, so that's the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>"If I'm being negative the club could end up going down if I'm dragging all the young ones down with me. It's easy to do that at a club.</p>
      <p>"One thing I'll never do is become a bad egg. How do I cope with the frustrations? I just go home and work on the punchbag. I just batter that for an hour.</p>
      <p>"I'm coaching our under-16s too at the moment and, honestly, you have no idea how much of a stress relief that is.</p>
      <p>"We train twice a week and have a game on a Sunday. It means I'm not sitting about the house the day after the first-team play stewing."</p>
      <p>MacKinnon does not entirely agree with Rice's decision to axe him but that will not stop him supporting his team-mates – including the man who has taken his slot.</p>
      <p>"After the Motherwell game, the manager pulled me in and said there will be some times when I play six weeks in a row but others where I'll be out for six," he explained. "That's fine. At least he's being honest with me.</p>
      <p>"You'd rather he was doing that than walking past me in the corridor and saying 'all right'.</p>
      <p>"I've only missed one squad and that was against St Mirren. He pulled me in and explained. He's paid to make the big decisions – it's his neck on the line, not mine.</p>
      <p>"He's been playing with Alex Gogic sitting in front of the defence with two more forward-thinking midfielders.</p>
      <p>"Gog is in the position I want to play in but he's been fantastic. I'm not sitting here hoping he's brutal so I can get back in.</p>
      <p>"He's been through a tough time with injuries so I'm not hoping he has a bad game. I would have when I was younger but now you realise if he's doing well so will the team."</p>
      <p>An injury and suspension crisis could yet open the door for MacKinnon to make his return to Rice's starting line-up on Sunday when Steven Gerrard's in-form <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/rangers/"><b>Rangers</b></a> visit the Foys Stadium.</p>
      <p>And MacKinnon is ready to take the fight to the Light Blues.</p>
      <p>He said: "All you can do is be prepared. If the manager thinks I'm worth a start against Rangers on Sunday then I'll be ready.</p>
      <p>"Last month at Ibrox it was 5-0 but could have been anything Rangers wanted as they were on fire that day.</p>
      <p>"However, no-one likes coming here with the astroturf and the two stands so we have to make it horrible for them. Be annoying, get stuck in and hopefully a wee bit of quality will win the game."</p>
