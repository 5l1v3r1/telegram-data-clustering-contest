      <h2>Cameos by the top-order and Rana’s four-wicket haul see it beat Maharashtra by 77 runs</h2>

      <p>Delhi made a strong start in the Super League phase of the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament with a comprehensive 77-run win over Maharashtra at the CB Patel stadium here on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Put in to bat, Delhi made 167/5 thanks to small cameos by the top order batsmen with skipper Dhruv Shorey making an unbeaten 48. He was ably helped by Himmat Singh, who slammed a 16-ball 32 with three sixes. On a wicket that had turn and bounce, it was Nitish Rana that starred for Delhi — picking up four wickets with his off-spin in addition to his 21 with the bat.</p>
      <p>In reply, Maharashtra’s chase never got going. Every time a batsman tried to take charge and go over the top for a big one, he found a fielder invariably and the team was bowled out for just 90.</p>
      <p>Only opener Ruturaj Gaikwad showed some fight with a valiant 42 (32b, 4x4, 1x6) but he struggled for support from the other end.</p>
      <p>Delhi’s fielding was top notch with some brilliant relay catches in the deep in addition to two run-outs including the crucial one of Kedar Jadhav.</p>
      <p>Earlier, opener Shikhar Dhawan started things off well for Delhi with a six in the first over hitting left-arm spinner Azim Kazi over midwicket before finding two boundaries off pacer Digvijay Deshmukh through point. Fellow opener Hiten Dalal too looked good as the duo got Delhi off to a good start with a 44-run opening wicket stand. However, Deshmukh fought back removing opener Dalal caught at midwicket before off-spinner Shamshuzama Kazi dismissed Dhawan for 24, caught behind when going for a reverse sweep.</p>
      <p>The off-spinner soon had Anuj Rawat too caught behind to reduce Delhi to 68/3 in the ninth over. Shorey then started aggressively with a six and four before he consolidated while Rana looked to go after the bowling with a couple of sixes against the spinners in his 18-ball 21.</p>
      <p>Himmat Singh who joined Shorey then gave the innings some momentum scoring at a strike rate of 200 in a knock that included two fours and three sixes.</p>
      <p>In one over off Deshmukh, Himmat hit him for two sixes — one over long-off and a hook over midwicket — before putting a full toss through the leg-side for a boundary. Once he was dismissed, Shorey took charge with three quick boundaries that pushed Delhi’s total beyond 160 as he brought up his half-century.</p>
