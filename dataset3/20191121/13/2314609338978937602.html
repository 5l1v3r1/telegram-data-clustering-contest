      <h1>ANZ and Westpac next big banks to face 'junk' insurance class action</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:01</time> by <a rel="author">Tammy Mills</a></address>
      <p>Westpac and ANZ will be sued in the latest court action against the big banks over accusations customers were sold insurance for credit card and loan repayments that they did not need or could not use.</p>
      <p>Two days after NAB reached a $49.5 million settlement for selling "junk" insurance policies to unsuspecting customers, lawyers with Slater and Gordon say they will lodge class actions against ANZ and Westpac over the same issue.</p>
      <p>The banks sold consumer credit insurance to customers on the promise it would help them meet their repayments on credit cards and personal loans if they lost their job, got sick or died.</p>
      <p>But for many customers who signed up, the policies were worthless because they were ineligible to claim insurance in the first place.</p>
      <p>Slater and Gordon practice group leader Andrew Paull said the junk products added thousands to credit card bills and personal loan repayments with little or no benefit.</p>
      <p>"Customers who trusted the big banks were ripped off and continue to be out of pocket after being pressured to sign up to worthless insurance cover," Mr Paull said.</p>
      <p>"Many people who purchased these insurance products had disabilities, were unemployed, or were critically ill, and therefore not eligible to claim against the insurance products."</p>
      <p>Melbourne mechanic Steve Vaiopoulos didn't even realise he had insurance on his ANZ credit card until his new receptionist noticed the charges on his bill every month.</p>
      <p>He realised he had been charged between $99 and $180 every month since 2015, adding up to roughly $8000.</p>
      <p>"It's not chicken feed," Mr Vaiopoulos said.</p>
      <p>"[The bank] said 'That's just the charge we put on your account on the insurance' and we said, 'What insurance?'" Mr Vaiopoulos said.</p>

      <p>He said he has been moving his business away from ANZ since and he is one of hundreds of disgruntled customers that Slater and Gordon say have contacted them to join the class action.</p>
      <p>"It's just the dishonesty of it," Mr Vaiopoulos said.</p>
      <p>The new class actions follow the $49.5 million settlement NAB and its wealth arm MLC reached with Slater and Gordon on Wednesday. That money will be distributed to tens of thousands of customers.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p4z37e.html">Commonwealth Bank admitted to similar conduct last year and was forced to refund $16 million to 140,000 people.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The big banks no longer sell the insurance policies after it came under the spotlight of the Hayne banking royal commission and corporate regulator ASIC.</p>
      <p><a href="https://download.asic.gov.au/media/5201456/rep622-published-11-july-2019-1.pdf">ASIC found banks and lenders used unfair sales tactics</a>, including telling customers insurance was a condition of credit.</p>
      <p>The regulator said banks and insurers collected more than $1.78 billion in premiums on credit card insurance, but returned only 11 cents in every dollar that customers paid.</p>
      <p>ANZ returned almost seven cents per dollar, while Westpac paid 11 cents. Both were lower than NAB.</p>
      <p>Car insurance claims return about 89 cents in the dollar, while almost 50 cents is returned for travel insurance.</p>
      <p>Westpac and ANZ declined to comment on the class action on Thursday.</p>
