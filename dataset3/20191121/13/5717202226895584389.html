      <h1>Spurs fans react to Alderweireld, Vertonghen and Eriksen reports</h1>

        <b>A number of Tottenham Hotspur fans have taken to Twitter to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/jose-mourinhos-plans-tottenham-contract-20924759">comment on reports from the Daily Mirror</a> regarding the futures of Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Christian Eriksen.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As reported by the Mirror, all three are out of contract this summer. And it appeared, from the outside, that they may be heading for the exit with the players able to discuss pre-contract moves with non-English clubs in January.</p>

      <p>But it appears that the trio may be open to having a change of heart. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/jose-mourinhos-plans-tottenham-contract-20924759">The Daily Mirror reports that</a> Alderweireld, Vertonghen and Eriksen are intrigued by the prospect of working under Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>And it is suggested that they are now open-minded about their futures. It is perhaps fair to say that the report concerning the three players has divided plenty of supporters on social media.</p>

      <p>On the pitch, it would be a massive boost for Tottenham to have the three men stick around, particularly if Mourinho can help them get back to their best in the coming months.</p>
      <p>However, the reports did not sit well with a lot of supporters. None of the players have particularly impressed this term. Eriksen, in particular, has come in for a lot of criticism.</p>
      <p>And it appears that it will actually disappoint a lot of supporters if their form enjoys a dramatic turnaround in the very near future. It is clear that a number of fans feel a lot of loyalty to Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Of course, Spurs fans ultimately want to see their side do well above anything else. But it seems that the supporters would not be entirely comfortable with seeing a significant transformation that inspires Alderweireld, Eriksen and Vertonghen to all sign new deals.</p>
      <p>Here is how some of the supporters have reacted to the reports…</p>
