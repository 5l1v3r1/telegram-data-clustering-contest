      <p>Julian Fellowes has said that he gave Mr Carson a tremor in the final episode of Downton Abbey in an attempt to dispel myths surrounding the condition.</p>
      <p>The screenwriter, best known for his work on Downton Abbey and Belgravia, lives with an essential tremor, a nerve disorder characterised by uncontrollable shaking.</p>
      <p>Fellowes said he wrote the scene, in which Mr Carson, played by Jim Carter, struggles to pour a bottle of wine, because he wanted to “get it out there”.</p>

      <p>But he said many people missed the point and assumed Mr Carson was suffering from Parkinson’s disease.</p>
      <p>Appearing on ITV’s Lorraine on Thursday to discuss living with the condition, Fellowes said: “It is a question of getting it out there.</p>
      <p>“That’s why on Downton in the last episode of the final series we gave Carson an essential tremor, so he couldn’t pour the wine.</p>
      <p>“Even then the newspapers referred to it as Parkinson’s because they didn’t know it was a tremor.”</p>
      <p>He said he wanted to raise awareness of the condition to avoid the public confusing the two.</p>

      <p>“Nobody talks about it but also nobody’s ever heard of it,” he added.</p>
      <p>“It’s called an essential tremor and as you can see my hands are shaking.</p>
      <p>“It gets better and worse, worse in the morning. Actually it’s better when you’ve had a drink which is an interesting detail.”</p>
      <p>He urged people suffering from a tremor to visit the doctor, adding that he had been prescribed pills which worked for half those with the condition, although they did not for him.</p>
      <p>He said: “What I’m anxious to do is get it out there.</p>
      <p>“So when people have a shake that is unexplained to them and they’re possibly panicking that it’s Parkinson’s, I would just say to them please go to the doctor.</p>
      <p>“The truth is you are eight times more likely to be suffering from an essential tremor than Parkinson’s.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t kill you. It doesn’t hurt. It’s a nuisance. It’s tiresome. But there are plenty of things that are worse in the world that people have to put up with.”</p>
      <p>Fellowes admitted that at the start he was “in denial” and blamed his shaking on a lack of sleep and too much coffee.</p>
      <p>He said he became more open about his diagnosis after his wife Emma warned that people would think he was “either drunk of terrified”.</p>
      <p>Fellowes also addressed whether there would be a sequel to the Downton Abbey film, saying: “I’ll do me best, gov”.</p>
