      <p>Homegrown, healthy <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/asian">noodle house</a> Wokyo has opened in Dubai’s Al Safa.</p>
      <p>Chances are you’ve heard the name <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/wokyo">Wokyo</a> because the casual noodle bar already has a restaurant in JLT.</p>
      <p>But now, Japanese food-lovers over the other side of town can see what they’ve been missing with the fancy <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/423618-brand-new-restaurant-argentina-grill-to-open-at-la-mer">brand-new</a> – though tiny – location near Safa Park.</p>
      <p>Located on the corner of Al Safa 1’s Al Wasl Square – just a stone’s throw away from the Canal – the family-friendly fuschia-coloured eatery is small, with a few of high tables as well as a couple of lower options too, all of which have views of the open plan kitchen.</p>
      <p>Diners can pick their preferred ingredients from a compact menu, which lists a choice of sauces, variety of noodles and lastly the protein – chicken, beef, prawns, tofu or vegetables.</p>
      <p>Everything is then thrown into a wok – the name of the restaurant gives this away – and combined to perfection ready to eat in or take away.</p>
      <p>Wokyo also does home <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/412791-dubais-best-food-deliveries">delivery</a> so you can order your Asian fare in for lunch or dinner, unless you fancy the ramen, which you'd be better off slurping up in store.</p>
