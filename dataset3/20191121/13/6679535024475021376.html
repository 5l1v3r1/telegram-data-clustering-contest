      <p>When Prahlada said that the Lord was everywhere, even in a small atom, Hiranyakasipu struck the pillar before him, and out came Narasimha. Hiranyakasipu had requested Brahma that he should not be killed by man or animal; he should not be killed inside a structure or outside; he should not be killed during the day or during the night; he should not be killed by any weapon. Brahma had granted him all his requests. And that is why Vishnu had to come as Narasimha — in half-man, half-lion form, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan in a discourse. The Lord killed Hiranyakasipu in twilight, which was neither day nor night. He sat on the threshold and put the demon on his lap and tore him with His nails. So, he was killed neither outside nor inside his palace, and since the Lord’s nails were used, clearly the boon of not being killed by a weapon was also kept.</p>
      <p>The Lord went to such lengths to kill Hiranyaksipu, because He wanted to ensure that Brahma’s promises were kept. As Narasimha, the Lord assumed a huge form, which extended beyond Satyaloka, the abode of Brahma. Satyaloka was near His navel. Vedanta Desika, in his Dasavatara Stotra, writes that it seemed as if Brahma was emerging again from His navel. Hiranyakasipu was himself a huge demon, and the Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana gives us an idea of his size. Ravana goes on a digvijaya, and reaches the netherworld, of which Mahabali is king. Ravana sees a dazzling mountain there, and asks Bali about it. Bali says that what Ravana referred to as a mountain had once been the ear ornament of his (Mahabali’s) great-grandfather — Hiranyakasipu! So, if an ear ornament looked like a mountain, the size of the demon can be imagined. It was such a huge demon whom Narasimha lifted easily, and killed using His nails.</p>
