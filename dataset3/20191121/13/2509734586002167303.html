      <h1>Tiny Crystals May Help Scientists Trace Causes of Brain Inflammation in Parkinson’s, Study Reports</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:00:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Catarina Silva, MSc</a></address>
      <p>Tiny and traceable man-made crystals, known as quantum dots, may be useful in carrying toxins to select cells in the brain, allowing researchers to better understand <a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/">Parkinson’s</a> neurodegenerative processes by being able to model and visualize them, researchers in Canada report.</p>
      <p>Their study, “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0161813X19301342">Quantum dot conjugated saporin activates microglia and induces selective substantia nigra degeneration,</a>” was published in <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/neurotoxicology"><i>NeuroToxicology</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Microglia, primary immune cells of the brain and spinal cord, are known to contribute to the inflammation that underlies Parkinson’s neurodegeneration, which severely affects a brain area involved in motor control called the <i>substantia nigra</i>.</p>
      <p>A key aspect of Parkinson’s research is to understand new and targeted ways of modulating microglia’s behavior, with a goal of influencing the survival or neurons or nerve cells. Such an ability would help to address the precise link between neurons and microglial cells.</p>
      <p>Quantum dots, or nanoscale crystals, can be specifically taken up by microglia cells and may be useful as a direct way of targeting these cells. The nanoparticles also glow a particular color after being illuminated by ultraviolet light, allowing scientists to trace the molecules inside cells and study their cellular behavior.</p>
      <p>Researchers at <a href="https://carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a> investigated whether microglia within the <i>substantia nigra</i> of mice would take up quantum dots alone, and quantum dots carrying an immunotoxin called <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3813907/">saporin</a>. The latter works by inactivating ribosomes — cells’ protein builders — which compromises protein synthesis and leads to cell death. The scientists also studied how these nanoparticles affected microglia status (i.e., whether it is active or inactive).</p>
      <p>Animals were given a four-minute infusion directly into their <i>substantia nigra</i> of either quantum dots alone, or of one of two doses of quantum dots conjugated with saporin. Within a week post-infusion, the mice’s balance and coordination were assessed.</p>
      <p>Using imaging technology, researchers observed that quantum dots alone were selectively taken up by microglia and activated them. Microglia activation is a hallmark of inflammation in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. Despite their activated state, however, microglia had minimal effects on neurons and other neuronal support cells like astrocytes.</p>
      <p>But in mice whose quantum dots were administered together with saporin, scientists observed a significant dose-dependent reduction in the number of nigral — meaning “of the <i>substantia nigra</i>” — neurons that produce dopamine, as well as impaired motor coordination six days after the infusion.</p>
      <p>Quantum dots conjugated to saporin also increased the levels of a molecular mediator of inflammation, called WAVE2. This protein “is critical for the changes in activation state morphology of microglia,” the scientists wrote</p>
      <p>The researchers believe that quantum dots carrying saporin could be a new and targeted way of modeling Parkinson’s-related inflammation, and evaluating new therapies aiming to treat it.</p>
      <p>“[Quantum dots] might be a viable route for toxicant delivery and also has an added advantage of being fluorescently visible,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>“Future work using this model should attempt to establish various degrees of neuronal loss. This model could then be used to test neuro-recovery or protective agents at differing stages of [the disease],” the researchers added.</p>
