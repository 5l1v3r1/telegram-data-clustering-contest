      <h1>Ryanair passengers could get money back from hand luggage fees</h1>

      <p>A Spanish court has called Ryanair’s hand luggage policy ‘abusive’ as it ordered the airline to refund a passenger for paying extra to keep a bag in the cabin.</p>
      <p>The holidaymaker, who was flying from Madrid to Brussels, said Ryanair staff made her pay €20 (£17) to take her 10kg hand luggage on the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Following the incident, she took the budget airline to a Madrid court which ordered Ryanair to refund the cost of the hand luggage plus interest.</p>
      <p>Court documents, reported by El Pais, reveal Ryanair was also ordered to compensate her a further €10 (£7) for the hassle.</p>
      <p>It comes after Ryanair introduced a new policy last year, which charges passengers extra if they want to take luggage into the cabin which is deemed larger than a personal bag.</p>

      <p>The airline is one of a few which do not allow travellers to take on a cabin-sized bag free of charge.</p>

      <p>Customers now have to pay for priority boarding to take one bag measuring 55cm x 40cm x 20cm into the cabin. If they do not, they will incur charges at the airport.</p>
      <p>Only a handbag or laptop bag measuring 40cm x 20cm x 25cm is allowed for free, but if it exceeds these dimensions, passengers will have to pay an extra £25 to put it into the holding area.</p>
      <p>But a Spanish judge said the claimant’s luggage could be carried in the cabin, due to its size and weight, and there was no need to charge her.</p>
      <p>When ruling on the case, the judge called the policy ‘abusive’ and cited a Spanish aviation regulation which allows passengers to carry luggage in the cabin area at no extra cost.</p>
      <p>Last year, Spanish consumer group FACUA-Consumidores en Acción accused the airline of breaking rules laid out in the country’s Law of Air Navigation by not allowing bags on aircrafts for free.</p>
      <p>There is no similar law in the UK but the case could encourage other passengers to come forward and claim money for paid hand luggage.</p>

      <p>The judge added that the policy ‘curtailed the rights that the passenger has recognised by law’.</p>
      <p>However, her claim for compensation was rejected as the level of discomfort she faced did not justify a payout.</p>
      <p>Ryanair said in a statement: ‘This ruling will not affect Ryanair’s baggage policy, either in the past or in the future, as it is an isolated case that misinterpreted our commercial freedom to determine the size of our cabin baggage’.</p>
