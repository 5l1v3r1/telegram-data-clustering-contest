      <h2>In the latest edition of the end of the decade series, football.london takes a look at the three times Arsenal lifted the most traditional prize in English football</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Amie Wilson</a></address>
      <p>Three trophies in four years, the 2010s was a pretty good decade for Arsenal in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Finals against Hull City, Aston Villa and Chelsea are sure to live long in the memory of Gunners' fans. All three games bought different elements to them. There was coming back from two early goals to win in extra time against Hull, then the 4-0 demolition of Aston Villa just a year later, before a memorable performance against then Premier League Champions Chelsea to regain the famous trophy.</p>
      <p>While the Premier League or even Champions League title became elusive to Arsenal during the decade, winning the FA Cup would have bought joy to many of the club's fans over the years where uncertainty reigned over the manager's future.</p>
      <p>Take a look below at how the media reported on the three Wembley finals.</p>
      <h3>May 17th 2014 - Arsenal 3-2 Hull city (AET)</h3>
      <p>A comeback that will remembered fondly by Arsenal fans, as it earned them their first piece of silverware in nine years. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-3-2-hull-match-report-3556039">The Mirror's Dave Kidd</a> tells the story of how a the dramatic game unfolded.</p>

      <p>"There could have been no more fitting scorer of the winning goal as Arsene Wenger finally toasted a first trophy in nine years.</p>
      <p>For Arsenal showed uncommon patience in Wenger, while he showed uncommon patience in Aaron Ramsey – and all good things come to those who wait."</p>
      <p>"After such a lengthy wait for silverware, it was never likely to be easy, but the Gunners roared back from two early Hull goals to win one of the great FA Cup Finals of the modern era.</p>
      <p>"James Chester and Curtis Davies had sent the Tigers into ­dreamland early on, but Santi Cazorla soon clawed one back, with a free-kick, before Laurent Koscielny’s second-half leveller.</p>
      <p>"It certainly does not seem to involve any mention of the ­opposition – because Hull love a set-piece and they love a ­wing-back bombing down the flank, yet Arsenal did not appear to have a clue how to defend against either.</p>
      <p>"Wenger had stuck with ­semi-final ­shoot-out hero Lukasz Fabianski, ahead of his fellow Pole Wojciech ­Szczesny, and, inside eight minutes, he was retrieving leather from onion bag – twice.</p>
      <p>"First, Ahmed Elmohamady won a corner, Stephen ­­Quinn played it deep to Tom ­Huddlestone, whose scuffed volley was cutely diverted in by Chester.</p>
      <p>"Then, Quinn crossed from the left, Alex Bruce’s header cannoned off the post and Davies fired in from a tight angle.</p>
      <p>"They were cavorting in the Wembley aisles after eight minutes of mayhem and euphoria. Smiles as wide as Steve Bruce’s waistline. Kids too young to remember when this club almost fell out of the Football League not so long ago, lifelong fans who recall it all, even the old ladies in their tiger-print replica shirts, dancing as if Bet Lynch was staging an acid-house rave in the Rovers.</p>
      <p>"Kieran Gibbs was soon heading off the line to avert a complete early meltdown. And then, perhaps out of ­embarrassment, Arsenal decided to join in.</p>
      <p>"Bruce fouled Cazorla 25 yards out and the Spaniard ­clambered up off his backside to curl home a free-kick, which Allan McGregor could only help into the net.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Yet, there was still little purpose about Arsenal’s play.</p>
      <p>"They spent much of the first half squabbling like car-crash victims on the hard shoulder, trying to apportion blame. Mesut Ozil was wafting his way through the Final like a £42million ­apparition. He ought to have scored from a Lukas Podolski cross, but miskicked meekly.</p>
      <p>"After the break, though, it became clear that Hull were going to have to cling on for dear life if they were to lift the new silver pot.</p>
      <p>"And on 71 minutes when Bacary Sagna won a header from Cazorla’s corner, the ball cannoned off a defender for Laurent Koscielny to turn in from close range, forcing extra-time.</p>
      <p>"Early in that period, Olivier Giroud crashed a header off the bar from a Ramsey cross before the Welshman slammed home his 109th-minute winner after ­Arsenal’s outstanding sub Yaya Sanogo had created space.</p>
      <p>"There was still time for a kamikaze dash out of the box from Fabianski, allowing Sone Aluko to shoot wide across the face of goal.</p>
      <p>"But, finally, the waiting was over, the Boyo with the “bounceback-ability” capping one of the great Wembley comebacks."</p>
      <h3>30th May 2015 - Arsenal 4-0 Aston Villa</h3>
      <p>It was just slightly more comfortable that the year before against Hull, Arsenal brushed aside Aston Villa to retain the FA Cup, as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-4-0-aston-villa-alexis-5791828">the Mirror's Mike Walters</a> explained in his match report:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.football.london/incoming/article17290934.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_mirror-back-page-arsenal-FA-cup-2PNG.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>"Prince William, David Cameron, Nigel Kennedy, Randy Lerner... your boys took one hell of a beating.</p>
      <p>"Villa were outplayed, at times overwhelmed, and close to being humiliated in the most one-sided Cup final since Manchester United crushed Millwall 3-0 at the Millennium stadium in 2004.</p>
      <p>"If there has been a more timid, limp performance from a top-flight club in the end-of-term showpiece in the last 30 years, nobody at the national stadium could remember it.</p>
      <p>"Arsenal should have been home and hosed before the interval as Villa's goal lived a more charmed life than a snake in a basket. As a spectacle, it was a pity their good fortune did not hold out for longer.</p>
      <p>"Laurent Koscielny's glancing header from a Santi Cazorla corner, where more substantial contact would have served him better, set the tone for near misses and hearts skipping a beat in the Midlands after nine minutes.</p>
      <p>"The French defender was foiled by Shay Given's instinctive save six minutes later as the 39-year-old goalkeeper demonstrated the reflexes of a man half his age as Villa struggled to contain the tide of yellow shirts pouring towards their goal.</p>
      <p>"Tom Cleverley and Alan Hutton were booked for cynical fouls, and Christian Benteke escaped censure for another, as the chances came and went.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"Aaron Ramsey, stretching to reach Bellerin's cut-back from the dead ball line, could only shovel his finish into the side netting.</p>
      <p>"Then Ramsey lifted his shot over the top - after a hint of handball in the build-up – and only Kieran Richardson's last-ditch block denied Walcott a certain goal from five yards out.</p>
      <p>"Walcott's pace had been preferred on Arsenal's front line to Olivier Giroud's all-round metrosexual threat, and five minutes before the break Gunners manager Arsene Wenger's big call was vindicated.</p>
      <p>"Nacho Monreal's left-wing cross was nodded down by Alexis Sanchez header and, as Alan Hutton dithered, Walcott slammed his shot inside Given's near post to break the stalemate.</p>
      <p>"But if Villa thought they had got away with a first-half chasing relatively unscathed, Sanchez took their breath away – along with the watching nation's oxygen supply – with a moment of magic five minutes after the restart.</p>
      <p>"Drifting in from the left flank, Sanchez hit a swerving, dipping missile from almost 30 yards that kissed the underside of Given's crossbar on its way in.</p>
      <p>"For half a second, there was a stunned silence at the east end of Wembley, where Arsenal supporters formed a bank or primrose yellow, and then the penny dropped in the fruit machine.</p>
      <p>"Sanchez had scored one of THE special FA Cup final goals, an absolute rocket. Think of Roberto Di Matteo's instant hit for Chelsea after 42 seconds against Middlesbrough 18 years ago and you get the picture.</p>
      <p>"On the hour, Per Mertesacker evaded his marker, Christian Benteke, from a right-wing corner and although the big German defender's contact was not clean, his header bounced inside the unguarded far post. Game over.</p>
      <p>"And in the last seconds of stoppage time, substitutes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Olivier Giroud combined to deliver one last blow to Villa's solar plexus, the French striker prodding home at the near post.</p>
      <p>"Thanks for coming, Villa – the club who fought like lions to reach the FA Cup final and then didn't even lay a paw on their opponents."</p>
      <h3>27th May 2017 - Arsenal 2-1 Chelsea</h3>
      <p>After failing to retain the trophy for a third season in a row, Arsenal found themselves back at Wembley, but this time they were facing the Premier League Champions, Chelsea. It was a Gunners' performance that impressed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsene-wenger-deserves-respect-much-10514706">the Mirror's Andy Dunn</a> .</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>"This was a Wenger team with an unrecognisable intensity. On one Chelsea attacking occasion, three defenders raced each other to deny Diego Costa.</p>
      <p>"Mesut Ozil executed a sliding tackle on Eden Hazard. Let me repeat that. Mesut Ozil executed a sliding tackle on Eden Hazard.</p>
      <p>"Granit Xhaka was granite-tough and Danny Welbeck was a persistent, limb-whirring pest.</p>
      <p>"When Arsenal perform like they did here, Wenger’s insistence this group of players has what it takes to emulate Conte’s Chelsea goes from risible to reasonable.</p>
      <p>"That is the thing with Wenger. He appears to be an incurable optimist, he is an incurable optimist.</p>
      <p>"He probably thinks Mertesacker has got a couple more seasons in him.</p>
      <p>"The likeable German’s performance was one of the stories of this peculiar but hugely enjoyable contest. It was a lesson in positioning.</p>
      <p>"Wenger, though, if he stays, will need defensive extras.</p>
      <p>"The remain route now looks likeliest, for sure.</p>
