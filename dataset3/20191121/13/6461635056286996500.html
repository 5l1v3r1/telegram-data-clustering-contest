      <h3>Barcelona are keeping close tabs on Eduardo Camavinga and are now preparing to make a bid for the wonderkid, as per <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1200066/reports-manchester-united-barcelona-solskjaer-messi-17-year-old-eduardo-camavinga-rennes-real-madrid-zidane/"><b>Fox Sports</b></a>. It is also believed that Real Madrid identified the 17 year-old long ago and had him as a target since a long time.</h3>
      <p>Eduardo Camavinga has been a star in the making for Stade Rennais and has scored 1 goal till date from 16 appearances. He signed his first professional contract with the club at the age of 16 back in 2018 and is now on Barcelona’s radar</p>
      <p>The midfielder has shown promising signs of agility and good game awareness which has naturally attracted the La Liga giants’ interest. It is believed that Manchester City and Bayern Munich are interested in snapping up the 17 year-old as well.</p>
      <p>Oliver Letang, the club president is now preparing to initiate talks with the youngster. He hopes to keep the wonderkid for at least 10 more years having identified his massive potential. However, he has identified Camavinga as a hot prospect in the transfer market.</p>
      <p>With the squad set to undergo a major overhaul, Ernesto Valverde could try and bring in Camavinga who could accompany the likes of Frenkie de Jong in the center of the pitch. Camavinga will be a long-term prospect for any club that he decides to pursue his future in and the Catalans should go for him, to expand their youth pool. However they should understand that they’re up against a stiff opposition in Real Madrid.</p>
