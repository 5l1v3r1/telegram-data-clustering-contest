      <h1>Coldplay Pause Touring to Have a Think About How to do it Environmentally Soundly</h1>

      <p>Members of the band Coldplay have declared a moratorium on the touring of their new album, as the band tries to come up with a way of getting lots of amplifiers and lighting equipment from Cambridge to San Francisco in a way that isn't quite as environmentally unsound as getting a load of hungover tattooed blokes to load up a chartered 747.</p>
      <p>Band boss Chris Martin told the BBC that "We're taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable" but also made somehow "actively beneficial" to the world. Staying at home and not playing their songs is benefit enough to the world, surely? But then they might write <i>more</i> songs out of boredom. What a conundrum this modern world is, eh?</p>
      <p>Martin then downsized environmental expectations by saying a ban on plastic beer cups might be about the sum total of their ideas, adding: "The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered."</p>
      <p>And the band does have quite an enormous carbon debt to pay off, as they put on 122 shows in 2016/17 -- a global carbon-slog which must've involved numerous aeroplanes, some probably hired out specially. Separate taxis to the venue as they must all hate each other by now too. Even if the band members re-forest the various country estates they own, they've still got a long way to go. [<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">BBC</a>]</p>
