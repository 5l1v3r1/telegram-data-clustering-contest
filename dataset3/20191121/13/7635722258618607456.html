      <h1>Coldplay to pause touring over environmental concerns</h1>

        <b>British band Coldplay says they are pausing touring over their concerns about the environmental impact of concerts.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lead singer Chris Martin told <i>BBC</i> that the band - who are releasing their new album <i>Everyday Life</i> this week - will take the next year or two to work out how the tour can be both sustainable and 'actively beneficial'.</p>
      <p>He said flying will be the most difficult issue to address, but that their dream is to have a show with no single use plastic and that is largely solar powered.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">He told <i>BBC</i></a></b>: "We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?</p>
      <blockquote>"How can we harness the resources that our tour creates and make it have a positive impact?</blockquote>
      <p>"Everyone will catch up if you prove that it's easy to do it the right way."</p>
      <p>Mr Martin said the band would be 'disappointed' if their next major tour isn't carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>Instead of a traditional concert launch tour, Coldplay are playing two concerts in Jordan which will be broadcast free on YouTube tomorrow (coinciding with the local sunrise and sunset).</p>
      <p>Coldplay's last 'Head Full of Dreams' world tour was in 2016/17, with the band playing venues in North / South America, Europe, Asia and Australia / New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the band's announcement, Technological University Dublin's Professor Gordon Chambers - who researches the impact of plastics on the environment - said these issues need to be addressed globally.</p>
      <p>He noted: "I'm sure Coldplay and Chris Martin are very eco-friendly in their own lifestyle.</p>
      <p>"[But] we need policies and real legislation that will help the situation, and that's up to the politicians."</p>
