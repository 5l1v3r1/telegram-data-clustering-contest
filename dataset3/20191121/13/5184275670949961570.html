      <p><i>Dabangg 3</i> also stars south star Sudeep Kiccha as the villain in the film. Helmed by Prabhu Deva, the film is slated to hit the theatres on December 20. In a recent conversation, the filmmaker had opened up on his experience of working on Dabangg 3. He said, “I was new to the Dabangg universe. Everyone else (in the unit) had worked in the first and second parts of the series. Of course, I had seen both the earlier films. So, I made an effort to get into the groove. Luckily for me, I didn’t fall flat.”</p>
