      <h1>Boat safety blitz in lead up to summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:52:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler Brown</a></address>
      <p>AS the summer boating season approaches, skippers are urged to check their vessel, trailer and safety equipment before heading out on the water.</p>
      <p>This Saturday marks the start of two weekend-long campaigns at metropolitan boat ramps where the Department of Transport and Main Roads will undertake safety checks on vessels and trailers.<br/>Officers will also be reinforcing the need to have safety gear that is in good condition and accessible in an emergency.</p>
      <p>The first weekend (November 23 and 24) will focus on boat ramps from Hillarys to Two Rocks and the second (November 30 and December 1) will concentrate on launch sites from Woodman Point to Port Kennedy.</p>
      <p>The campaign will also encourage skippers and passengers to take the 30-Second Challenge, which tests if people can gather flares, EPIRB, make a radio call and don a lifejacket in 30 seconds.</p>

      <p>The Department of Transport also produces a free BEST Check guide, which identifies items that should to be maintained before each trip and lists items for an annual 45-point check.</p>
      <p>“Spring is the best time to undertake the BEST check as it allows time for repairs before the boating season,” Transport Minister Rita Saffioti said.</p>
      <p>“Skippers are responsible for taking the time to complete the recommended voyage preparation guidelines every time they head out on to the water.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, skippers who fail to do this put their safety and that of those on board at risk, and also waste the precious resources of our volunteer marine rescue groups.”</p>
