      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity….Get Me Out Of Here!</a> campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a> finally spoke out about the rumours regarding her ‘feud’ with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cheryl-fernandez-versini/">Cheryl</a>. and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-grills-nadine-coyle-girls-aloud-beef-cheryl-brands-fake-news-11191860/">called the gossip ‘fake news.’</a></p>
      <p>When asked by fellow campmate EastEnders actress Jacqueline Jossa if it was true she and the Call My Name hitmaker never got along, Nadine rubbished the claims.</p>
      <p>Everyone loves a feud though, don’t they? Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-fellow-wag-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-elaborate-plan-expose-10887652/">Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy</a>. For the longest time Nadine and Cheryl – the two key members of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/girls-aloud/">Girls Aloud</a> – were put into the same category.</p>
      <p>Every girlband has its inter-political dramas, of course, but these two were always front and centre of all the drama. Who got the most solos? Who would quit the band first? Who would reach number one with their debut single?</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But since the Insatiable singer – now I’m A Celeb contestant- has finally spoken out on the feud rumours, we thought now would be the perfect time for a little deep dive into the history of Britain’s once-premier girl band and its two central stars (sorry Kimberley, Nicola and Sarah).</p>
      <h4>The beginnings of the feud</h4>

      <p>Most Girls Aloud scholars agree that things for the band started to break apart around the time of their fourth album, Tangled Up, when Nadine moved to America.</p>
      <p>Living in the States full-time obviously drew a sharp wedge between the members of the group. Due to the distance (both literal and metaphorical) Nadine recorded all her vocals by herself and missed several key promotional activities.</p>
      <p>She wasn’t even present when the girls won their first Brit award for Best Single with The Promise in 2009.</p>
      <p>There;s also the contentious topic of solo careers in the mix. Nadine seemed like, for the longest time, to be the inevitable Geri Halliwell or Zayn Malik of the band – her move to America was bolstered, initially, with dreams of solo stardom away from the rest of the group.</p>
      <p>That didn’t work out, however, as Cheryl became the de facto breakout hit of the band thanks to a string of number one hits including Fight For This Love and Promise This. Nadine had to contend with a record deal with Tesco and is now releasing music independently alongside old producers Xenomania.</p>

      <h4>The infamous Girls Aloud break-up via Twitlonger</h4>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Remember Twitlonger? The little app you could use to extend your tweet beyond 140 characters? Girls Aloud fans sure do, as that was how the band – on the road for their ten year anniversary tour – decided to break the news that they were actually splitting up, for good this time.</p>
      <p>Only, it soon emerged after the split that the decision had come from the other members of the band – Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, Nicola Roberts and Sarah Harding – and not Nadine herself. She even tweeted herself, claiming she had wanted to keep the band going beyond their reunion tour.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is all a little bit indirect, of course, but don’t you worry, both Nadine and Cheryl haven’t exactly been shy speaking about their apparently fractious relationship following the band’s final, inevitable break-up.</p>
      <h4>Cheryl on Nadine: ‘She’s full of s***’</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Well, that’s certainly one way to put it.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Attitude Magazine in 2014, Cheryl took affront at the suggestion that she and fellow band-mates Kimberley and Nicola were to blame for the band’s permanent split, instead insinuating that the Call The Shots hitmakers only went on hiatus so Nadine could record a solo record.</p>
      <p>‘She’s full of s***,’ she said. ‘What d’you want us to say? She’s full of s***. She was the one who wanted to make a solo record. Which is why we took the hiatus.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘She wants to come out and say we broke the band up? No! She shouldn’t tell porkie pies.’</p>
      <p>After the interview dropped, Cheryl then swiftly unfollowed Nadine on Twitter. Oh dear.</p>
      <h4>Nadine on Celebrity Juice: ‘There was no friendship to begin with’</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Appearing on Celebrity Juice last year, it took none other than Keith Lemon to get Nadine to finally comment on something in public.</p>
      <p>Asking which member of Girls Aloud were her favourite, Nadine answered with the very diplomatic ‘them all!’ But things quickly got a lot more awkward.</p>
      <p>Lemon asked if there had been a falling out, to which Nadine replied with the very depressing: ‘There was no falling out, there was no friendship to begin with.’</p>
      <p>Ouch!</p>
      <h4>Reconciliation?</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_99109724.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C364&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>The band will celebrate their 20th anniversary in 2022 (Picture: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Girls Aloud will celebrate their twentieth anniversary as a band in 2022. Anniversaries such as this are so lucrative for pop bands, especially for a group with such a long-standing legacy (name us a better song than Call The Shots, you still can’t).</p>
      <p>We would be very surprised if the girls didn’t band together to do at least…something to celebrate. The intervening years haven’t been as kind to other members as they have to Our Cheryl, and every celebrity needs a re-jolt of energy every few years.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>So maybe, the feud is just a smoke-screen; everything that’s happened in the past seven years since the split has been engineered to make it seem like a reunion was impossible, so when the big anniversary <i>does</i> happen, it’s so unexpected and shocking it becomes more lucrative than ever.</p>
      <p>Maybe Nadine’s comments on I’m A Celebrity is just the first breadcrumb in a long, long trail. What’s that noise? Not the Sound of the Underground, but the Sound of a Reunion?</p>
