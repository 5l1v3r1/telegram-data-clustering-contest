      <h1>New 13-year birth control for men involves injection into scrotum</h1>
      <h2>It is effective 97 per cent of the time in trials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:52:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>Men could soon be able to get a contraceptive that involves just one injection, has a 97 per cent success rate and lasts for 13 years.</p>
      <p>The system is ready to go, if the inventor can find a company willing to take it on, and involves one injection into the scrotum.</p>
      <p>The male birth control has now successfully completed a clinical trial at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/male-birth-control-thats-injected-20920090">The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hindustan-times-ltd">Hindustan Times</a> , Dr R.S Sharma, a senior scientist with the ICMR, said: “The product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending [from the government].</p>
      <p>“The trials are over, including extended, Phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with a 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects. The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive.”</p>
      <p>The system works by injecting a polymer called styrene malieic anhydride into the vas deferent - the two ducts that carry sperm out of the testicles and which are cut in a vasectomy.</p>
      <p>The polymer blocks sperm from leaving the testicles, and the effect can last for up to 13 years.</p>
      <p>Professor S.K Guha, a scientist from the Indian Institute of Technology, said: “The polymer was developed by Professor S.K. Guha from the Indian Institute of Technology in the 1970s. ICMR has been researching on it to turn it into a product for mass use since 1984, and the final product is ready after exhaustive trials.”</p>
      <p>The product could be available within seven months.</p>
      <p>But a recent survey by YouGov revealed only one in three men would be willing to take male birth control.</p>
      <p>Researchers from the Los Angeles Biomed Research Institute have developed a male birth control pill that’s now been successfully tested in healthy men.</p>
      <p>Based on the findings, the researchers believe that the pill could be widely available ‘in about 10 years.’</p>
