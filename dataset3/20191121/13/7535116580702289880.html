      <p>Bullying is perhaps one of the most common problems that many young people tend to face when they’re still in school. Young and rebellious children have a tendency to exact violence on other kids, without necessarily thinking of the consequences they leave behind.</p>
      <p>But for some victims of bullying, they’re not about to take things lying down. In fact, they’re willing to fight back against their bullies and stand up for themselves!</p>

      <p>In a video that was recently posted to social media by <a href="https://twitter.com/iloveyouIPOH/status/1197172548695281664">@iloveyouIPOH</a>, a boy was seen being viciously attacked by his classmates while someone sitting across from him films the entire incident. Defenseless, all he appears to do is sit against the wall and quietly take the beatings that were being doled out to him.</p>

      <p>It’s worth asking <b>why the person filming the video didn’t intervene</b>, as the beatings that the boy had to endure appeared to be rather severe. One boy can be seen <b>hitting him with a rolled up textbook</b>, while another<b> grabs hold of a schoolbag before covering the head of his victim and shoving him down.</b></p>

      <p>But again, the victim didn’t seem to react and only pushes himself back upright to sit. That doesn’t last long, however. In a sudden surprise, the victim grabs hold of one of his bullies by the arm and drags him down from his chair!</p>

      <p>He then puts him in a choke, forcing him down onto the ground before punching him in retaliation! <i>Woah!</i></p>

      <p>In light of his courage for standing up to his bullies, netizens over Twitter immediately rallied behind the victim, with many saying how satisfying it was to see both bullies being immediately put in their place!</p>

      <blockquote>
        <i>“People say that it’s not that victims of bullying don’t want to retaliate. But they fear that those who they retaliate against might wind up in worse condition. That’s why they remain silent. But if you get it from them, you’re done. <br/></i>
        <i>Don’t test the patience of other people. Unless you don’t care about your life.”</i>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        <i>“If your children behave like demons don’t bring them into religious schools. Pity the kids who wind up becoming the victims of bullying. Btw, I love the last part. If you’re being bullied, don’t stay silent. Fight back and teach your bullies a lesson.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Again, we have to say that we do not condone violence of any kind, especially in the context of bullying. For those of you who are suffering from cases like this, please always report them to your teachers or parents. But we also have to commend the boy for standing up for himself!</p>
