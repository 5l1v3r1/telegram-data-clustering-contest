      <p>Moreno was officially relieved of his duties following Spain's 5-0 win over Romania on Monday to make way for the return of Luis Enrique, despite securing the nation's qualification to the 2020 UEFA Championship.</p>
      <p>Enrique was forced to step down from the role earlier in the year after his daughter tragically fell ill and later passed away, but an agreement had been in place for him to return to the position if he so wished. </p>
      <p>Notwithstanding this agreement, Moreno was visibly emotional after it was confirmed that Enrique would return, and the 42-year-old has now released a statement. </p>

      <p>"Faced with an extreme situation like the one we experienced in Malta, I had to assume the leadership of the national team," Moreno said, as reported by <i>AS</i>.</p>
      <p>"The objective of qualifying (for Euro 2020) entrusted to me has been achieved comfortably.</p>
      <p>"Assessing the last few hours in office or even the last few days would only serve to enter into a spiral of reproaches and justifications for each of the parties. I am not going to do it. I don't see any sense in that.</p>
      <p>"I have a clear conscience. It is impossible to please everyone, but I sincerely tell you that I respect everyone and all opinions.</p>
      <p>"I have always maintained that I am a man of my word, that I would not be an impediment in the event that Luis Enrique decided to coach again. I have done so even though it has meant my departure. I wish him well because his joys will be ours.</p>
      <p>"... My experience as head coach began and ended in the same way, with a bittersweet flavour.</p>
      <p>"I have to look forward and face new challenges as a coach in my passion, football. I am prepared to face the challenge of leading new projects."</p>
