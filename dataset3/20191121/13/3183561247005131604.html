      <p>Jabra's latest set of wireless earbuds, the Elite 75ts, are now available for purchase in Australia. The earbuds feature a marginal spec bump from the original Elite 65ts, including 50 per cent more battery life and a new comfort fit. If you're looking at upgrading, you won't find a lot of difference here, but they're a good option for wireless earbud lovers.</p>
      <p>We got our first look at Jabra's latest earbuds back <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/jabras-great-truly-wireless-earbuds-just-got-better/">in September</a>, and after launching in the States earlier this month, Aussies are now able to get their hands on the earbuds from their local retailers.</p>
