      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:39:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:39</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Hayley Parker, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A half-naked man tracked down by paedophile hunters for sending depraved photos in his underwear to a '13-year-old girl' has walked free from court.</p>
      <p>Safeguarding Kids Online filmed as they stopped Derek Leonard standing against a brick wall in Cheadle, Staffordshire, and quizzed him about his actions.</p>
      <p>Despite protesting his innocence at the time, unemployed Leonard - who has distinctive tattoos on his chest and arm - eventually says: "I've done wrong, I'm sorry".</p>
      <p>The 27 year old also blamed his crimes on drink and drugs and says what he'd done was "sick".</p>
      <p>However, he continues to deny he's sexually attracted to children, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/moment-half-naked-pervert-cornered-17290961">Birmingham Live</a> reports.</p>

      <p>Leonard told the confronters: "It must have been when I was on the drugs and that. I can't remember anything really. I must have missed that she was 13. I ain't attracted to children."</p>
      <p>During the video, the paedophile hunting group repeatedly told him the evidence will be used against him and police will use a Section 18 to search his home.</p>
      <p>They also suggested he seeks help for his issues.</p>

      <p>At Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, Leonard went on to plead guilty to a charge of attempting to sexually communicate with a child.</p>
      <p>The court heard Leonard had been chatting on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> messenger with a girl he believed to be aged 13, but in fact was an adult posing as a child.</p>
      <p>The conversation turned sexual and he sent images of himself in his boxer shorts and another with his genitals deleted.</p>
      <p>Leonard has since been hounded out of Cheadle after the video was live-streamed on Facebook.</p>
      <p>He was handed a community order for 18 months, with a requirement for 30 hours of rehabilitation activity and an alcohol treatment requirement.</p>
      <p>He was also hit with a sexual harm prevention order and ordered to keep police informed of his whereabouts.</p>
