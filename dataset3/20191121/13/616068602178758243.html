      <p>Being by yourself for the holidays can be lonesome, but there's an option for you if you want to be with people in the community.</p>
      <p>Together for Christmas is coming back for its 11th year on Christmas Day, offering free Christmas dinners to those who need it.</p>
      <p>"We will be giving out food to people that may be homeless, elderly, disabled or part of low-income families," says Jae McDermott, one of the organizers for Together for Christmas. "We just don't want anyone to feel alone during the holidays."</p>
      <p>There are volunteer drivers who will take people to and from the dinner if they need it. For those who are shut in and don't want to be surrounded by people, there are also delivery drivers who will take a plate of food to their place.</p>
      <p>"We are offering a lot more than just a dinner," says McDermott. "There will be crafts, door prizes, music and even a volunteer hairdresser who will come in and cut people's hair."</p>
      <p>The dinner will be taking place on Christmas Day at St. James School. Doors open at 2 p.m., and dinner will start being served at 4 p.m. There is no end time, doors will close when the last person is served.</p>
      <p>Together for Christmas is always looking for donations, if you are interested in donating, you can contact Jae at 250-308-9600. Volunteer slots for the event have already been filled, only calls regarding donations will be accepted.</p>
