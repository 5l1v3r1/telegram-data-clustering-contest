      <p>Ada Wodu, Calabar</p>
      <p>The Cross River State Governor, Professor Ben Ayade, on Thursday presented the 2020 budget to the state House of Assembly.</p>
      <p>The budget estimates tagged budget of Olimpotic meristemasis is pegged at N1,100,167,507.09.</p>
      <p>Giving a breakdown of the budget, Ayade said N911 billion representing 82% of the estimates will be for capital estimates while N188 billion representing 17.2% will be spent on recurrent expenditure.</p>
      <p>He said N44 billion was allocated to the health sector, N38 billion for education, N22 billion for agriculture while N85 billion will go to the New Cities Project.</p>
      <p>On taxation, the governor said no nation taxes its people to prosperity and so daily taxes will be abolished for low-income earners including traders and civil servants who earn below N100,000 per month will be exempted from taxes.</p>
      <p>He said a flat monthly tax will rather be paid by low-income earners while the government will continue to legalise hawking by creating some hawking bases in the state to assist low-income earners.</p>
      <p>He said the tax regime in the state beginning from next year will become softer as a means of boosting the income of low-income earners and high-income earners will be the ones who pay more tax.</p>
      <p>He added that agro-based industries under construction in the state will come on stream next year and the government hopes to earn about N380 billion from the industries.</p>
      <p>He said the budget looks unachievable but his administration is determined to actualise it and sought the cooperation of the legislature.</p>
      <p>In his response, Eteng Williams, Speaker of the State Assembly promised to give the necessary support and assured that the budget will be approved before the end of the year.</p>
