      <p>Ranu Mondal became a popular name after her video, singing “Ek Pyaar Ka Naghma hai”, at a railway platform, went viral. Impressed with her talent, music composer-singer Himesh Reshammiya recorded two songs with her for his upcoming film Happy <i>Hardy and Heer</i>. At the launch of the song <i>Teri Meri Kahani </i>from the movie, Mondal said she was blessed to receive this opportunity. “I am grateful for the love of people. They have given me immense love and I got a chance to sing. Himesh ji gave me this big chance, relying solely on my voice. I’m so grateful. If I didn’t have the love, I maybe wouldn’t have been able to sing songs. I have God’s love, which is why I could sing,” Mondal added.</p>
