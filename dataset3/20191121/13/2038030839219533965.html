      <p>Cape Town – The rumour-mill is swirling – and this time with news that <i>Hot Girl Summer</i> rapper Megan Thee Stallion and NBA player Tristan Thompson are dating.</p>
      <p>Reports came flooding in when the 24-year-old was spotted at one of Tristan's games. Rumour has it Tristan slid into her DMs to invite her. Then the couple allegedly went out for dinner after. But Megan cleared things up when a fan tagged her in a report of <a href="https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1197205320713613318"><b>Twitter</b></a>.</p>
      <p>"They outchea lying on you sis," the tweet read, to which Megan replied, "Lol they literally made up a whole LIE I was at knicks game with my manager and my friend Ej."</p>
