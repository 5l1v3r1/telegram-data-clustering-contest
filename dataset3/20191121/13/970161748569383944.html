      <p>Joaquin Phoenix feared getting locked into a Joker franchise before he accepted the role.</p>
      <p>The star recently spoke about the supervillain flick, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/08/joker-now-profitable-comic-book-movie-ever-made-topping-almost-1-billion-worldwide-11068748/">that earned a whopping $1billion (£771,475,000) at the box office.</a></p>
      <p>But despite its success, it turns out the 45-year-old was reluctant to play the comic book character.</p>
      <p>Chatting to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-11-13/joaquin-phoenix-joker-fan-theories-sequel-oscars">the Los Angeles Times, the actor opened up on his first impressions of the movie</a> when he was offered the job.</p>
      <p>He told the publication: ‘I remember, like eight years ago, I was told, “Movies are changing. They’re not making the movies that you want to make, so you’ve got to do one of these.”</p>
      <p>‘It makes sense. It probably is a good strategy. But for me, I guess the fear was that you’d get locked into doing something repeatedly that you don’t really care about, that doesn’t motivate you or excite you.’</p>

      <p>But, it didn’t take long to convince Joaquin that he had done the right thing, as it only took a matter of weeks before he was asking the directer, Todd Phillips for a sequel.</p>

      <p>‘In the second week or third week of shooting, I was like, “Todd, can you start working on a sequel? There’s way too much to explore.” It was kind of in jest – but not really,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I basically said, “You could take this character and put him in any movie.”‘</p>
      <p>And it seems as though his wish has been granted, as it was recently rumoured a second movie was in the works.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, it was reported that there could be a sequel following the box office success.</p>

      <p>Phillips is said to be in talks to return as director for the sequel and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/joaquin-phoenixs-joker-earns-sequel-hitting-1-billion-box-office-despite-gun-violence-backlash-11189468/">is thought to be writing the script with Scott Silver, who also worked on this year’s Joker.</a></p>
      <p>While it’s been claimed that the studio rejected Phillips’ original pitch of tackling several origin stories for different characters, it has been reported that he could have the rights to one other DC story.</p>

      <p>However, Deadline shut down the story claiming that no such talks have taken place. Yet.</p>
