      <h2>Totnes Greens have stood aside as part of a national pact</h2>

      <p>A special 'How Should Totnes Greens Vote?' event is being held because of confusion in the famously alternative town following a national pact by the remain parties not to split the vote.</p>
      <p>The town could produce a close three horse race between Dr Sarah Wollaston - who defected from the Conservatives and now stands as a Lib Dem - her replacement Tory Anthony Mangnall and the Labour candidate Louise Webberley, who points out that Labour came second in the constituency in 2017 with just over 26 per cent of the vote. Independent John Kitson, the man who has successfully halted 5G in Totnes, is also standing.</p>
      <p>The seat of Totnes also includes Brixham, parts of Paignton, Dartmouth and South Brent. Although Totnes town centre voted to Remain the rural areas voted for Brexit.</p>
      <p>The Greens agreed to stand aside in Totnes as part of the pro-Remain political parties' pact which divided up the country's 60 most winnable constituencies - and that included Exeter and Totnes which has been left on a political knife-edge after sitting <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/rebel-devon-mp-joins-lib-3212113">Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollasto</a>n changed parties. </p>
      <p>Stephen Reid, the Totnes Green candidate who stood aside, said: "There is some confusion in Totnes. It is being interpreted that we are behind Sarah Wollaston because of the Lib Dem's pro-Remain stance but we have been careful not to say that. Whilst we want to unify the Remain vote we are not backing any one particular candidate. To underline this we are hosting a 'How Should Totnes Greens Vote?' event.</p>
      <p>"It has emerged that the Labour candidate Louise Webberley is very much pro-Remain and we think the result in Totnes could be a close-run battle with all three candidates likely to win about a third of the votes.</p>
      <p>"We are inviting people to bring food to share so that we can have a really civilised grown-up discussion."</p>
      <p>The event at the Civic Hall just under a week before the election will be a pot luck supper and will include small group discussions for most of the evening before a short group discussion for the last half-hour.</p>
      <p>The South Devon Green Party said: "With the Green candidate in Totnes standing aside as a consequence of our broken electoral system, those who were considering voting Green in Totnes are now faced with a difficult decision at the General Election. <br/><br/>"At the Civic Hall on the evening of Saturday 7th December for a presentation of the Green Party manifesto followed by discussion on the topic How Should Totnes Greens Vote?</p>
