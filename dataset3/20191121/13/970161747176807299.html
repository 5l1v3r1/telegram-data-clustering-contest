      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> bonanza is nearly upon us and it’s quite right to think you could pick up some Apple gear on the cheap.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, because Apple is about as big as it gets when talking about consumer technology – it goes about Black Friday a little differently.</p>
      <p>Last year, for example, rather than reduce its products, it offered incentives when you bought them at regular price.</p>
      <p>Pick up an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/iphone/">iPhone</a>, for example, and you got a £40 Apple Store Gift Card. That rose to £80 if you buy an iPad. You get the idea: Apple doesn’t have to play by the standard rulebook.</p>
      <p>It also doesn’t tend to reveal any red hot offers ahead of time and we’re still a good week away from Black Friday proper.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, there are plenty of other retailers happy to discount the tech company’s gadgets.</p>
