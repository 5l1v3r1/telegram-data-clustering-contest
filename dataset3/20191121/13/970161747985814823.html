      <p>It seems Christmas has well and truly come in the Rooney household as Coleen and Wayne‚Äôs children were the stars in a festive photoshoot this week.</p>
      <p>The pair have four boys, Kai, 10, Klay, six, Kit, three, and Cass, one, who were all decked out in Christmas-themed pyjamas for the series of images.</p>
      <p>Looking like a crew of festive elves, the siblings posed alongside other children, as well as Santa himself (IT‚ÄôS SANTA!) with proud mum Coleen sharing the images on social media overnight.</p>
      <p>While nary a smile was shared between the four of them in the first shot (not a fan of photoshoots perhaps? Still rightly scared of Santa?) Coleen was chuffed as she wrote: In Love üòç‚Ä¶..</p>

      <p>They then grinned up a storm as Coleen uploaded several images to Instagram of her boys.</p>
      <p>Their cherubic faces looked like cartoon drawings as they gazed to the side of the camera, surrounded by toys in what appeared to be Santa‚Äôs famous workshop.</p>

      <p>In other shots, the boys were seen being presented with their gifts from Santa which is a bit early if you ask us ‚Äì we‚Äôve still got a month‚Ä¶and three days, to go.</p>
      <p>Channelling the festive vibes, the siblings then gathered around for a reading of The Night Before Christmas.</p>
      <p>We can only assume Coleen and Wayne are ready to celebrate Christmas and put 2019 behind them after a tumultuous few months in the spotlight.</p>
      <p>Wayne ‚Äì who was based in the US playing for DC United ‚Äì was first <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/25/wayne-rooney-seen-getting-hotel-lift-mystery-woman-seven-hour-bender-10627922/">seen outside a lift with another woman</a> in the early hours of the morning back in August, before Coleen was then in the press after she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/coleen-rooney-accuses-fellow-wag-rebekah-vardy-behind-fake-stories-elaborate-plan-expose-10887652/">accused fellow WAG Rebekah Vardy of providing false stories</a> of her family to the press.</p>
      <p>Of course <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/28/wayne-rooney-insists-not-cheat-girl-hotel-shock-statement-10644944/">Wayne spoke his piece about the elevator incident</a>, citing it an innocent moment that went no further than a chat in the lobby of a hotel, and Becky V ‚Äì who is married to Jamie Vardy ‚Äì <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/09/rebekah-vardy-slams-coleen-rooneys-claims-selling-stories-suggests-instagram-hacked-10887883/">denied she leaked stories</a>, one can only assume Coleen wants to kick back with a Hot Toddy and say sayonara to the year that‚Äôs been.</p>
