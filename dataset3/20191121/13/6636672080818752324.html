      <p>The scheme encourages members to introduce friends and colleagues to the engineering platform, which offers access to resources such as free MCAD and ECAD design software, CAD neutral libraries as well as the 850,000+ global DesignSpark community. A referral earns both the existing and newly registered member entry into a quarterly prize draw, to win a Fitbit tracker and £500 of products stocked by RS.</p>
      <p>There are no limitations on the number of referrals and there is a goody bag for the ‘top’ referring community member each quarter.</p>
      <p>Aside from the hope of material gain, the company points out that the design engineering platform is a forum for engineers around the world to exchange ideas and advice and access professional tools and software to shorten design time and time to market.</p>
      <p>The first draw will take place on Monday 13 January 2020, for all referrals made between 4 October 2019 and 12 January 2020.</p>
