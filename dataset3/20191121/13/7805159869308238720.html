      <h1>Digital Wellbeing preps a “Minimal Phone” mode to help you Wind Down at night</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T13:37:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 13:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/mishaalrahman/" target="_blank">Mishaal Rahman</a></address>
      <p>Since Google initially showed off its Digital Wellbeing app at Google I/O last year, the app has gained a few useful features including Focus Mode and Chrome website integration. Google is also working on adding new enhancements to the “Wind Down” feature in Digital Wellbeing. A few days ago, we spotted a new “<a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/digital-wellbeing-tests-auto-enabling-wind-down-plug-in-charge-night/">plug-in to unplug</a>” feature in development, and now, we’re seeing a new “minimal phone” mode.</p>

          <b>An APK teardown can often predict features that may arrive in a future update of an application, but it is possible that any of the features we mention here may not make it in a future release. This is because these features are currently unimplemented in the live build and may be pulled at any time by the developers in a future build.</b>

      <p>Wind Down is a useful feature that helps you put down your phone at night by optionally enabling a grayscale filter on the screen to reduce the urge to browse your phone. You can also have Wind Down enable Do Not Disturb mode to silence notifications, and you can also have it enable Night Light to reduce eye strain from blue light. The latest version of the Digital Wellbeing app, version 1.0.281262011.beta, rolled out on the Google Play Store earlier today, and we managed to surface a new setting in Wind Down called “minimal phone.” When enabled, this feature will presumably allow you to block access to all apps except for a handful of preselected “bedtime” apps. This setting takes effect when Wind Down is enabled—either manually or automatically on a schedule.</p>

      <p>This feature is not yet available for users in the latest beta release, and it also doesn’t work yet even when manually surfaced. We’ll continue monitoring this and other features to keep you up-to-date on the latest developments of the Digital Wellbeing app.</p>
