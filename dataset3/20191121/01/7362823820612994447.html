      <h1>Nunes slams impeachment 'three-card monte,' then yields to Schiff for 'storytime hour'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:21:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:21</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee ranking member <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes, R-Calif.</a>, slammed the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> process during his closing remarks at Wednesday's hearing.</p>
      <p>Nunes compared the proceedings against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> to "three-card monte" and the medieval Inquisition.</p>
      <p>Democrats like committee Chairman <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a>, Nunes claimed, promised a fair hearing, but have not yet delivered.</p>
      <p>"What have they delivered? The impeachment version of three-card monte, the notorious short-con card trick where the mark -- in this case President Trump and the American public -- stands no chance of winning," he said.</p>

      <p>"The Democrats promised the whistleblower's testimony -- in fact, they told us we need to speak with the whistleblower."</p>
      <p>Nunes said Democrats' plans changed when reports surfaced that Schiff's staff had been in contact with the Ukraine whistleblower.</p>
      <p>Nunes then offered three statements he considered popular legal axioms: "If the facts are against you, argue the law. If the law is against you, argue the facts. And, if both are against you, pound the table and yell like hell."</p>
      <p>He claimed the Democrats are using a fourth "tactic" -- "If the facts and the law are against you, simply rig the game and hope your audience is too stupid to catch your duplicity."</p>

      <p>Nunes went on to claim the impeachment inquiry reminded him of the Middle Ages when inquisitors were able to bring a charge against someone without affording them due process.</p>
      <p>After Nunes concluded his remarks, he yielded the floor to Schiff, D-Calif., as required by House procedure, but not before making a quick dig at his rival.</p>
      <p>"I now yield to Mr. Schiff for 'Storytime Hour,'" the ranking member said.</p>
      <p>Schiff smiled and deadpanned, "I thank the gentleman -- as always -- for his, uh, remarks," a comment met by loud laughter in the hearing room.</p>
