      <p>Phone and online scams are getting more prevalent in Malaysia. The Home Ministry recently <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/12/women-main-target-for-macau-love-scams-but-men-fall-prey-too-says-home-ministry">revealed</a> there are 1,303 love scam or parcel scam cases reported this year with total losses amounting to RM67,737,419.38. 1,070 victims were female and 230 were male. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/08/14/here-are-3-tips-from-the-police-to-protect-yourself-from-being-scammed/">Macau scams</a> have affected 1,911 victims with a total loss of RM94,040,451.65.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, a 45-year-old rubber tapper had lost <a href="http://www.bernama.com/en/news.php?id=1790502">RM184,999</a> when he fell victim to a scammer that impersonated a high ranking officer from Bukit Aman. He was first contacted by a man that claimed to be a banker to settle outstanding credit card payments. Then he was ordered by a “police officer” to transfer all of his savings to other accounts to avoid losing the money on a promise that it will be returned within three days.</p>
