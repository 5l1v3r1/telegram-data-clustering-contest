      <p>Turner and teammate Jordan Bowden both <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/Vols-play-against-Alabama-State--565240522.html">hit a milestone in their career with 1,000 points in Wednesday's game</a>.</p>
      <p>But Turner spoke to WVLT News reporter Zack Rickens not about that, but about Arizona State transfer Plavšić. The NCAA <a href="https://www.wvlt.tv/content/news/UT-basketball-transfer-denied-eligibility--564284291.html">recently denied Plavšić's immediate eligibility waiver</a>.</p>
      <p>Turner said, "Free my boy Uroš, man, let my dog out."</p>

      <p>After the NCAA's decision, Tennessee Athletic Director Phillip Fulmer said, "We are extremely disappointed – quite frankly, stunned – in this outcome, and feel strongly that very compelling facts support clearance for immediate eligibility."</p>
      <p>There has been no update since the beginning of November on Plavšić's situation going forward.</p>
