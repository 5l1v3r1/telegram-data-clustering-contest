      <h1>Gold technical analysis: Looks heavy with signs of indecision on the daily chart</h1>

          <b>Gold could slip into losses as technical charts are indicating the recovery rally has run out of steam. </b>

          <b>The market sentiment is still quite bearish as the metal is struggling despite US-China political tensions. </b>

      <p>Gold is currently reporting marginal gains, but will likely come under pressure during the day ahead, according to technical charts. </p>
      <p>The yellow metal witnessed a two-way business for the second day on Wednesday. The resulting Doji candle indicates the bounce from recent lows near $1,445 has run out of steam. </p>
      <p>As a result, a pullback could be in the offing. Note that the metal is struggling to post gains despite the political friction between the US and China and fading trade optimism. </p>
      <p>The US 10-year treasury yield is also losing ground, currently trading at 1.724% - the lowest level since Nov. 4. Notably, the yield has shed more than 20 basis points in the last two weeks. </p>
      <p>Even so, gold is having a tough time scoring convincing gains. It clearly indicates the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">market sentiment</a> is still bearish. </p>
      <p>A break below the daily low of $1,471 looks likely and could pave the way for a deeper drop to $1,464 and $1,456. On the higher side, a daily close above $1,478 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup. </p>
