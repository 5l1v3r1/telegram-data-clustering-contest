      <p>TYRONE manager Mickey Harte has called up six new players ahead of the beginning of the McKenna Cup at the end of next month as the changes continue to be rung in the county's football set-up.</p>
      <p>With team captain Mattie Donnelly out with a serious injury for at least six months, Declan McClure confined to the sidelines with a knee injury and Connor McAliskey's decision to take a break from inter-county football for the foreseeable future, the Red Hands were down on numbers.</p>
      <p>However, yesterday's announcement by Colm Cavanagh that he intends to continue with the senior team in 2020 will have come as a timely boost. The only remaining link with the last of Tyrone's three All-Ireland winning teams in 2008, the 32-year-old midfielder will provide some much-needed experience on a panel now infused with youth.</p>
      <p>The six fresh faces are Michael O'Neill, Daniel Kerr, Conor Quinn, Conn Kilpatrick, Niall Kelly and Conal Grimes. Defenders Quinn and Grimes were integral members of the Tyrone U20 side who won the Ulster title in the summer and who were later narrowly beaten by eventual winners Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. Both players were recently selected as U20 National Allstars.</p>
      <p>Niall Kelly, who is also a defender, played a key role in helping his club Errigal Ciarán reach both the championship and league finals in Tyrone this season. Conn Kilpatrick is a midfielder from Edendork and has been a standout player at club and schools level. His father Adrian also represented Tyrone at senior level.</p>
      <p>Daniel Kerr has played minor and U21 football for Tyrone and, along with team-mate Quinn, he has played a key role in helping his club Galbally win the Intermediate double in Tyrone this season. The duo are currently preparing for an Ulster final date with Monaghan champions Magheracloone, which will take place in Armagh's Athletic Grounds next Saturday night.</p>
      <p>Ardboe's Michael O'Neill has been rewarded for a series of standout displays for his club and is another player who has represented the county with distinction at underage level.</p>
      <p>The composition of Harte's backroom coaching team has also undergone a shake-up over the autumn months, with Kevin Madden and Jonny Davis coming in for the departing Stephen O'Neill and strength and conditioning coach Peter Donnelly, who left to take up a post with the Ulster rugby squad as well as accepting a coaching role under Séamus McEnaney in Monaghan.</p>
