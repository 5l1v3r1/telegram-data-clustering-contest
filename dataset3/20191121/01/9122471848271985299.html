      <h1>Luka Doncic’s Halftime Stats vs. The Warriors Are Insane</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:55:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Luka Doncic is having himself a night. The Dallas Mavericks’ young star has put up an insane stat line against the Golden State Warriors this evening.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old phenom is in the thick of the NBA MVP race through the first month-plus of the season. Based on his play against Golden State tonight, it’s easy to see why.</p>
      <p>Doncic outscored the entire Warriors team in the first quarter of tonight’s game. He didn’t stop scoring in the second quarter, either.</p>
      <p>Through one half of play, Doncic has:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>33 points on 10 of 11 shooting</li>
        <li>6 assists</li>
        <li>5 rebounds</li>
        <li>+36 in 17 minutes of play</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Doncic’s 33 points are the second-highest halftime total in Dallas Mavericks history behind, you guessed it, Dirk Nowitzki, who poured in 34 against Utah in 2009.</p>
      <p>The Mavericks are leading the lowly Warriors, 74-38.</p>
      <p>If Doncic is going to put up an insane points total, Golden State is probably going to have to make some kind of a comeback. Doncic will probably be sitting all fourth quarter if not.</p>
