      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/2020-presidential-campaign">As they say in politics</a>, every vote counts. But when <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ariana-grande">a person</a> has more than <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Twitter">60m Twitter followers</a>, that vote might count for more than others.</p>
      <p>Just hours before the latest Democratic debate kicked off, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Bernie-Sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> received a welcome boost after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> shared images of them backstage at her concert with the words “MY GUY”.</p>
      <p>The post from the 26-year-old singer may not have been an official endorsement of the 78-year-old senator from Vermont, but it was hard to read it any other way. </p>
      <p>“Thank you Senator Sanders for coming to my show, making my whole night and for all that you stand for,” wrote the Grammy-winning artist, behind albums such as <i>Yours Truly </i>and <i>Thank U, Next</i>.</p>
      <p>She referred to the work of a project, HeadCount, that is seeking to register voters, particularly young people.</p>
      <p>She added: “We’ve already registered 20k+ young voters at my shows alone. Also I will never smile this hard again promise.”</p>
      <p>The Florida-born musician, who is 10th on the list of most popular Twitter accounts with 67.4m followers, has never sought to hide her progressive political views, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once tweeted a set-list that framed “progressive politics as an Ariana dance party”.</p>
      <p>Last year, Grande told <i>Elle</i> magazine: “There’s a lot of noise when you say anything about anything. But if I’m not going to say it, what’s the f***ing point of being here?”.</p>
      <p>Mr Sanders, who attended her gig in Atlanta, Georgia, which was also the venue of the fifth Democratic Party debate, also posted the images.</p>
      <p>“I want to thank Ariana Grande for not only being a wonderful entertainer, but also for being such an outstanding advocate for social justice,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>“We must all be prepared – like Ariana has shown – to fight for everyone who is struggling. It was great to meet her in Atlanta last night.”</p>
      <p>Mr Sanders wife, Jane Sanders, tweeted her own tribute.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “Thank you @ArianaGrande  for supporting @BernieSanders’ candidacy for president! Your Atlanta concert last night was incredible!”</p>
