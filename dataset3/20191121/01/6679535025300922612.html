      <p>A strong earthquake shook a border area between northern Thailand and Laos on November 21 morning, swaying Bangkok high-rises.</p>
      <p>Residents in the northern Thai city of Chiang Mai felt a long period of shaking but saw no major damage. High-rise buildings swayed slowly for at least half a minute in the capital Bangkok, startling residents.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Geological Survey said the 6.1 magnitude quake was about 10 kilometers below the surface. Moderate quakes of 4.6 and 5.7 magnitude shook the same area overnight.</p>
      <p>It was centered about 31 kilometers from Chaloem Phra Kiat, which is about 280 kilometers northeast of Bangkok.</p>
