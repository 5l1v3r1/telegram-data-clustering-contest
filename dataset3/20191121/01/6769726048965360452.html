      <h1>Murdoch Uni cuts ties with Prince Andrew</h1>

      <p>PERTH’S Murdoch University has cut ties with a program founded by Prince Andrew amid continued backlash about his links to billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The university issued a statement on Wednesday saying it would no longer participate in Pitch@Palace, a global entrepreneurial program aimed at providing international development opportunities for early-stage businesses.</p>
      <p>“Murdoch University has today advised Buckingham Palace it would not continue its participation in Pitch@Palace in 2020,” a spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“We remain committed to supporting innovators and entrepreneurs. However, in the current circumstances, we have decided that our efforts in this area are best served through other means.”</p>
      <p>Queensland’s Bond University and Melbourne’s RMIT have both also confirmed they will no longer take part in the Pitch@Palace program.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew founded the program in 2014 and attended an event at Murdoch University last month.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York’s visit was marred by scrutiny of his relationship with Epstein, the disgraced US financier who took his own life in August in a New York prison cell where he was detained on charges of sex trafficking teenage girls.</p>
      <p>British media have reported the FBI expects to interview alleged trafficking victims in the hope they can provide more details about the Duke’s links to Epstein.</p>
      <p>Scotland Yard previously held an investigation after Virginia Giuffre made allegations against Prince Andrew, but that probe was dropped in 2015.</p>
      <p>The Duke, whose recent BBC television interview about the scandal was widely criticised, has denied all allegations against him.</p>
