      <h1>Essena O’Neill, The Influencer Who Famously Quit Insta In 2015, Is Back On Social Media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:03:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author">By Steffanie Tan</a></address>
      <p>Four years ago Australian influencer <b>Essena O’Neill </b>sensationally quit Instagram after loudly proclaiming that “Social Media Is Not Real Life”. It was a wild time, I tell you what, because Essena went viral. Like not just Twitter viral but <i>viral-viral</i> because influencers weren’t <i>as big </i>as they are today, and they certainly didn’t just quit their main source of income and make headlines for it. Everybody was talking about Essena, even the goddamn <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/fashion/essena-oneill-instagram-star-recaptions-her-life.html">New York Times</a> interviewed her about her choice to nuke the influencer life and expose the reality behind taking the perfect IG pic. It was bizarre. And well, now she’s back.</p>
      <p>Last week, Essena appeared on YouTuber <b>Tiffany Ferg</b>‘s series <i>Internet Analysis </i>to kind of just explain the whole shebang.</p>
      <p>Essena told Tiffany that she’s spent the last four years studying and working “shit jobs”. She also has a new website called <a href="https://www.authoritywithin.com/">Authority Within</a> which she says is purely opinion and a bit of everything, like things she loves and things that are a bit “fucked”.</p>
      <p>She also explained that she quit IG because she felt really lost and was struggling with the fame.</p>
      <p>“Instagram came out when I was 14 and that’s when it all kind of started,” she shared. “From 14 to 19, when I quit, that was my whole life.”</p>
      <blockquote>“I quit because it wasn’t making me happy, I wasn’t happy. I kept going around in these circles.”</blockquote>
      <p>Essena said she’s a very different person now and is “excited” to get back into it, despite all the drama.</p>

      <p>She’s also working on a podcast and maybe in the future she’ll return to YouTube but Essena said she’s not ready for that “anytime soon”.</p>
      <p>“I’m terrified of the internet but I think I’m a lot more sure of who I like, who I trust, and I think that makes your personality more than just other things.</p>
      <p>“… I was very hyper-focused on who I was, my body, how I looked, they were kind of the themes of a lot of my content and my life is so much better that that’s not the focus.”</p>
      <p>You can watch her full interview with Tiffany below.</p>
