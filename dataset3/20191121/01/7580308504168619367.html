      <p>Students of the Adekunle Ajasin University plying Akure-Akoko expressway has lamented the deplorable state of the road describing it as death trap.</p>
      <p>The road from Akure, which links Owo Oka, Akungba, Ikare and some other small cities in Akoko land are all in a bad state.According to the students, the unfavourable state of the road has caused incessant robbery attacks on travellers, which often claim lives and properties.</p>
      <p>Besides, they lamented that the several portholes on the road has caused heavy damages to vehicles and has given room for evil doers to effectively carry out their acts.</p>
      <p>Adefemi Emmanuel, a 200-level student of English education department lamented that the road is complicated and travellers as well as drivers are always at risk.</p>
      <p>He said, “Akure-Akoko expressway is very bad to the extent that travellers do not feel safe. The bad road has resulted in robberies, a lot of souls have perished, and has caused a lot of discouragement for drivers to even come to Akoko side.”Oguntuwase Esther also lamented the poor state of the roads an appealed to government to come to their aid.Emmanuel advised that the government should make the road more passable by filling potholes and reconstruct where necessary.</p>
      <p>Akintilayo Joshua of mass communication department implored the government to pay attention to the road so as to ease their difficulties.</p>
