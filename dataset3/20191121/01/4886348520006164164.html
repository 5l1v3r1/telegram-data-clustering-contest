      <h1>Hong Kong Bill Could Be Nail in Coffin for US-China Trade Deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:35:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:35</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/lozawatt</a></address>

        <li>Trump will likely sign a bill supporting Hong Kong protests, according to reports.</li>
        <li>The bill has been vehemently condemned by China.</li>
        <li>Stocks took a hit as hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal by 2020 are squashed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign legislation supporting protesters in Hong Kong, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-20/congress-sends-hong-kong-bill-to-trump-as-china-escalates-threat">according to a report in Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>The move would put Washington, D.C. on a collision course with Beijing and could squash any hopes of a U.S.-China trade deal before 2020. </p>

      <h4>U.S.-China Trade Deal Hanging by a Thread </h4>
      <p>If passed into law, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act could close the door on a <a href="https://www.ccn.com/us-china-phase-one-trade-deal-thwarted-by-chile/">“phase one” trade deal</a> by the end of 2019. </p>
      <p>The bill was drafted in response to Beijing’s crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. According to Reuters, the purpose of the bill is to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests-usa-rights/u-s-house-approves-hong-kong-rights-bill-sends-measure-to-trump-for-signature-or-veto-idUSKBN1XU2RZ">uphold human rights in Hong Kong</a> “by requiring regular reviews of the city’s special financial status.”</p>
      <p>The legislation has been<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/20/hong-kong-protests-beijing-condemns-bills-accuses-us-of-interference.html"> vehemently condemned</a> by China. According to foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang, China “<a href="https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web/fyrbt_673021/t1717260.shtml">strongly condemns and resolutely opposes</a>” the act.  </p>
      <p>Amidst trade hurdles and impeachment proceedings, the bill is the latest in a series of obstacles preventing a trade resolution between the U.S. and China.</p>
      <p>Trump has <a href="https://www.ccn.com/trade-talks-collapse-trump-impeachment-perfect-storm-sp-500/">threatened to slap more tariffs</a> on Chinese goods if trade talks with Beijing collapse.</p>
      <h3>Stock Market Slumps</h3>
      <p>Political speculation and news from the impeachment hearings caused stocks to slump Wednesday<b>.</b></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-jones-price">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> dropped 112.93 points, or 0.40%, to close at 27,821.09.</p>

      <p>The Hong Kong bill and a “quid quo pro” bombshell during the impeachment hearings <a href="https://www.ccn.com/dow-dives-as-impeachment-drama-compounds-trump-china-deadlock/">caused the Dow Jones to nosedive</a> in afternoon trading.</p>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 slightly dipped by 11.72 points, or 0.38%, to close at 3,108.46. </p>
      <p>Threats of fresh tariffs also caused Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stocks to drop 1.16%. But President Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197293250115014656">sought to reassure Apple on Wednesday</a> evening by announcing the opening of “a major Apple manufacturing plant in Texas.”</p>

      <p>According to Reuters, Trump also might <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-apple/trump-says-looking-at-whether-apple-should-be-exempt-from-china-tariffs-idUSKBN1XU2SN">exempt Apple from future tariffs on Chinese imports.</a></p>
      <p>Following the Twitter announcement, Apple saw a bump after hours and grew to 264.20, up 1.01%. </p>
