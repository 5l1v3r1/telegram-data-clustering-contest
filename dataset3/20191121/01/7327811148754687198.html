      <p>PARAMUS, New Jersey (WABC) -- A WWII veteran celebrating his 102nd birthday received a surprise bigger than he could have wished for.</p>
      <p>Michael Diederich asked the public to make his wish come true of getting 102 birthday cards for the big day, but he actually received closer to 3,000.</p>
      <p>He spent Wednesday celebrating his birthday at CareOne Management.</p>
      <p>Some of the cards came from as far away as England and Ireland.</p>
      <p>He said he's always had a soft place in his heart for cards - especially ones with dogs on them.</p>
      <p>"Well it started off when somebody asked me how many cards would you like, and I said 'oh I'd like one from every year of my birthday,' so that was 102 cards, but I've gotten a few more than that," Diederich said.</p>
      <p>He credits his long life to eating well and having a wonderful wife.</p>
