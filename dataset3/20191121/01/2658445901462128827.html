      <p>If you are professionally condemned to using data like Hardball, you would perhaps testify to the seeming racket that calls itself the data market.</p>
      <p>True, the GSM networks are varied, no less than four at the last count.  But we just might be seeing the birth of a ruthless oligopoly, come to ruthlessly milk the data market, with the market regulator not nimble enough to protect subscribers from network greed.</p>
      <p>All too sudden, data is vanishing from subscriber accounts, like luckless dew, under the early morning sun!  Even the minister of Communications and Digital Economy, that earlier expressed outrage, and read out the riot act for prompt correction, has no less promptly been mollified to let the regulator — Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) — do its work.</p>
      <p>That itself is conventional wisdom, which in itself is not bad, since it’s good optics, being free-market friendly.  But it might turn not-so-wise, for a case — a seeming abuse — that appears to be hitting an emergency.  NCC should therefore treat it as such; and hearken subscribers’ cries, as the minister appears to have done.</p>
      <p>Hitherto, and this is as near as two, three months ago, Hardball would load N2, 000 worth of monthly data bundle: to power the Internet, email, Facebook, WhatsApp; with little or no videos, and certainly no Instagram.  In that pristine data Eden, it would last all month; and only recharge for another month-long deal.  Not any more!</p>
      <p>Last month, a N3, 000 worth monthly data plan barely lasted 10 days!  Then this month, Hardball happened on an expected elixir: N5000 for a 15GB bundle, hoping that would do the magic.  But alas!  In just 18 days, it is hinting the data is all but used up, remaining only 50MB!</p>
      <p>Even the back-up, from a rival network, worth N3, 500 monthly bundle, is spewing the same yarn, even if that was strictly for back-up, should the main bundle come up short.</p>
      <p>So, you have two different networks but same dreadful story of vanishing data!  Yet, the networks assail you with a blitz of adverts, promising data as</p>
      <p>plentiful as the never vanishing sea water!  The reverse is the case.</p>
      <p>This is what the subscriber out there faces, day in, day out; and there appears no help in sight.  The annoying thing is the whole thing bucks basic economic concepts, that undergird the so-called free market.</p>
      <p>Basic economics speaks of the economy of scale: the larger the market, the likelihood the price would crash, other things being equal, so long there is competition.</p>
      <p>On the surface, there would appear competition, all right.  But with how data just vanishes, across the networks, other things would appear violently unequal!</p>
      <p>What is it?  Could it be that the networks have signed an industry-wide oligopolistic deal, for sweetheart jumbo data profit, leaving the subscriber perpetually groaning?  How do you explain more data on the surface but far less in real terms, the way the thing vanishes?</p>
      <p>That is what the NCC should investigate and fix.  On this, the minister should stick to his instinct, and push NCC, to push the networks, to do the right thing, by the market.</p>
      <p>The networks are entitled to due nourishment from their investment, but not at the expense of selling short the subscriber.</p>
      <p>That is what is happening now in the data market.  It is fast becoming racket.  The minister should push NCC to investigate; and ultimately smash this racket.  That is the right thing to do, to sanitize the data market.B</p>
