      <h1>Ballarat Cup 2019: fashion judges share their tips</h1>

      <p>A LEADING stylist and Central Square Fashions on the Field judge for Saturday's Ballarat Cup says poise, confidence and dressing for the weather are the keys to a successful day at the races.</p>
      <p>Skipton-based stylist Ema Smith, one of four judges who will decide the four categories at the fashions on the field events, says some golden rules need to be followed.</p>
      <p>"Confidence is key," Ms Smith said. "If the person if not confident, it shows in their outfit.</p>
      <p>"Attention to detail is what I look for. How does the handbag match in with the shoes?"</p>
      <p>"One of the tips I would definitely make is that I always dress for the weather. We're fortunate the weather will be nice, but always consider the wind, check your accessories, perhaps take a light jacket."</p>

      <p>Ms Smith said she was honoured to be chosen as one of the judges for what will be her first Ballarat Cup.</p>
      <p>"I've judged at Ararat Cup before and I'm also an adviser up at Avoca as well," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith said trends this year included one shouldered dresses "bold colour, very bright pops of colour, teals and greens suits".</p>
      <p>"Also total dressing, a full all-white outfit is incredibly striking.</p>
      <p>"For men, three-piece suits were all the rage at the Melbourne Cup carnival, but an attention to detail can really make a difference - perhaps an umbrella or a cane really adds to the whole outfit."</p>

      <p>However, there was one trend that she's going to leave up to the gents.</p>
      <p>"The sock or no socks trend is a European trend as the Europeans tend to wear loafers more," she said.</p>
      <p>"If you're going to go the no socks lock, you need to wear the right shoes or you can look like a fool. For me, it's a matter of what works for the outfit - if it works, it can look good."</p>
      <p>The four categories of Central Square Ballarat Fashions on the Field are: Traditional Lady of the Day, Contemporary Lady of the Day, Most Fabulous Millinery and Gent of the Day.</p>
      <p>Registrations from 11.30am with judging following race 1 at 12.25pm.</p>
