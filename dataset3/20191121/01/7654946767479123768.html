      <h1>Trump on impeachment hearings: ‘If this were a prizefight, they’d stop it!’</h1>

      <p>President Donald Trump compared the impeachment process to a professional boxing match on Wednesday, saying the Democrats were nearly knocked out.</p>
      <p>Trump was reacting to a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/gop-lawmakers-grill-sondland-trump-said-he-wanted-nothing-from-ukraine/">whirlwind day on Capitol Hill</a> that saw EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland grilled about his role in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“If this were a prizefight, they’d stop it!” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197298118330474498">Trump tweeted</a>, casting himself as the victor.</p>
      <p>Sondland had testified on Wednesday that Trump had said he wanted “nothing” from the Ukrainian president.</p>
      <p>The ambassador had <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/sondlands-bombshell-turns-out-to-be-merely-his-presumption/">originally stated that he was in discussions</a> with Ukrainian officials about launching an investigation into a company connected to Hunter Biden in exchange for releasing hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid for the American ally.</p>
      <p>But when he was questioned by Republican lawmakers, Sondland said something slightly different.</p>
      <p>“So you really have no testimony today that ties President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in exchange for these investigations,” Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) said.</p>
      <p>Sondland’s answer: “Other than my own presumption.”</p>
      <p>The ambassador had changed his story on other occasions, claiming he did not recall some things because he “did not take notes.”</p>
