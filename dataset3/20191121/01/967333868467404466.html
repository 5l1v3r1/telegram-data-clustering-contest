      <p>​The adorable pooch was allowed two attempts at the jump before the judges ultimately announced the “devastating news” that Bandit was eliminated from the doggie high-jump contest.</p>
      <p>Bronte Luce, who filmed and later shared cellphone footage of the event on social media, revealed that another contestant voted off the course was Danny, a blind dog who needed a little help from his handler in order to make it over the bar.</p>

      <p>​But in the end, it wasn’t all doom and gloom for this contest. There was also a doggo named Gus, who apparently “will do anything” for a stick - <a href="https://twitter.com/bronte__lee/status/1195503773730275329?s=20">even leap atop the jumping block</a>.</p>
