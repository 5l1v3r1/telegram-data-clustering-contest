      <h2>Mourinho is now the second highest-earning manager in world football after taking charge at Tottenham - and a look at the top 10 throws up a few surprises</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:09:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:09</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho is now the second highest-paid manager in world football after becoming Tottenham's new manager on a reported £15m-a-year contract.</p>
      <p>Mourinho's staggering salary puts him behind only <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss Pep Guardiola, who is said to be on £20m a year.</p>
      <p>The new Spurs boss's whopping pay packet is more than that of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> boss Jurgen Klopp and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> chief Zinedine Zidane.</p>
      <p>Mourinho, who has signed a three-and-a-half year contract, will reportedly earn double what his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino was on.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has won 25 trophies in his career as a manager, and that is what chairman Daniel Levy is banking on as Spurs seek silverware to go with the attractive brand of football developed under Pochettino.</p>

      <p>Guardiola's contract has certainly been worth it for City, who have won five out of six major domestic trophies under Guardiola.</p>
      <p>But who else makes the list of top 10 highest earners in management?</p>
      <p>A look at the game's top-paid bosses throws up a few surprises. Third behind Mourinho is not Klopp or Zidane, but Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone, whose contract until 2022 pockets him £13m a year, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705711/Jose-Mourinho-SECOND-highest-paid-manager-world.html">Daily Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>Two of the next big earners are from the high-paying Chinese Super League, with former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez on £11.5m with Dalian Yifang, and Fabio Cannavaro paid £10m per year by Guangzhou Evergrande.</p>

      <p>Zidane is joint fifth on the same as Cannavaro as he plots to return Real Madrid to the top of European football, while Antonio Conte is seventh, having joined Inter Milan in the summer on a £9m deal.</p>
      <p>Paris-Saint Germain boss Thomas Tuchel and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> chief Ernesto Valverde are in joint eighth place on £8m.</p>
      <p>Klopp completes the top 10 on £7m-a-year - and with Liverpool currently eight points clear at the top of the Premier League and reigning as European champions, Reds fans will feel he is worth every penny.</p>
