      <p>A 44-YEAR-OLD woman arrested on suspicion of murdering a Co Derry teenager 20 years ago has been released on bail.</p>
      <p>Jonathan Cairns (18) was attacked and killed in Ballykelly on his way home from a night out in April 1999.</p>
      <p>His body was discovered in a shallow grave at Loughermore Forest close to his Ballykelly home. No-one has ever been convicted of the murder although a 49-year-old man was sentenced to five years in prison in 2002 for perverting the course of justice.</p>
      <p>The PSNI said a 44-year-old woman was arrested in Dungiven on Tuesday but was released on bail yesterday "pending further enquiries".</p>
      <p>Det Insp Adrian Brown said the teenager's family and friends "have suffered intolerable grief" and "deserve answers".</p>
      <p>He appealed for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
