      <p>From <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/lev-parnas-helped-rep-devin-nunes-investigations">Daily Beast</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani, helped arrange meetings and calls in Europe for Rep. Devin Nunes in 2018, Parnas’  lawyer Ed MacMahon told The Daily Beast.<br/>…<br/>The travel came as Nunes, in his role on the House Intelligence Committee, was working to investigate the origins of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian election meddling.</blockquote>
