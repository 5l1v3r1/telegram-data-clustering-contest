      <h2>Van der Flier glad to be back in blue after disappointment of World Cup departure</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/john-o-sullivan-7.1837393" target="_blank">John O'Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>Josh van der Flier is content to indulge in some media shtick when reflecting on Jonathan Sexton’s try against <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Benetton">Benetton</a> last weekend. The tenet of the query was whether the flanker felt obliged to pass to the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Leinster">Leinster</a> captain on the off chance that van der Flier might have been tackled short of the line.</p>
      <p>He admitted: “At the time I thought I was going to get tackled, I didn’t realise how close I was but I was glad I passed because if I didn’t pass and I didn’t score that would have been bad news.” If it was anyone but Johnny, what option would you have taken? “I might have held it,” he chuckled.</p>
      <p>The Leinster camp appears a relaxed environment this week ahead of what will be a very demanding test against the French Top 14 leaders, Lyon, at the Stade de <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Gerland">Gerland</a>. It’s not that the province’s bonus-point victory over Benetton at the RDS was blemish-free, far from it, but it is possible to discern a growing confidence in content and tone.</p>
      <p>For the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news">Ireland</a> squad members it was an opportunity to shake the dust from the World Cup in what would have been a first game in Leinster colours this season for some, benefitting from the run-out and also the chance to reacquaint with team specific patterns and calls.</p>
      <p>Van der Flier explained: “I suppose the moment we’d come home from the World Cup, all I wanted to do was play again because you always remember the last game and you don’t want the last game, a loss, hanging over you.</p>
      <p>“It’s normally a Pro14 game you come back in for, obviously there’s a bit of pressure there, but <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Europe">Europe</a> is a different level. I got two full weeks’ training leading in and that helped a lot. I felt comfortable enough but obviously I was maybe a small bit rusty with some bits and pieces but I felt good coming back in.</p>
      <h3>‘Into a nice gap’</h3>
      <p>“There was a good flow to the game. I thought we attacked quite well and managed to find a bit of space. I got a few carries in as well which was nice. It was just the way the game panned out. Rory O’Loughlin put me into a nice gap once and then Johnny (Sexton) obviously made a break and passed to me and I got it back to him. It was just one of those games when I ended up with the ball quite a bit so I was happy enough.”</p>
      <p>The disappointment of the World Cup is aired and what if any lessons can be taken forward. “One thing I did notice, and I kind of knew it beforehand, no matter who you are playing, even against teams which are traditionally weaker sides, it’s the biggest game it’s the biggest game of their lives: the same for us, well for me anyway, playing at the World Cup.   </p>
      <p>“Teams will come up with things you’ve never seen before. They play better than you’ve ever seen before because it’s such a big deal, they’ve waited four years for it. I learned a lot that way and then I suppose it’s being around all the great players, spending time watching or playing against them in a World Cup, I learned bits and pieces from that as well.”</p>
      <h3>‘Greater honour’</h3>
      <p>Van der Flier was asked whether there was more joy in playing for Leinster, a specific reference to style of play. “It’s hard to say, really. It’s definitely a greater honour to play for your country. Any time you’re wearing a green jersey is really, really special. I suppose there’s less of those ground-out, really-tight games with club rugby; (it’s) a bit more open. I enjoyed the World Cup as well but, yeah, it was good to be back in blue.”</p>
      <p>His status as an Ireland international guaranteed nothing on his return to the province a fact of which he was quickly apprised on his return. <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Will+Connors">Will Connors</a>, in particular, and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Scott+Penny">Scott Penny</a> had both worn the number seven jersey with distinction in van der Flier’s absence, helping to ensure a six-game winning streak in the Pro14.</p>
      <p>“It was one of the things watching the games, coming back from the World Cup, I was thinking over the last couple of weeks that if I don’t train at my best or put in a really good performance when I can then I won’t be playing, because the other lads would deserve it; they’ve been playing so well.</p>
      <p>“It was one thing that Stuart and Leo said to me when I came back, that basically it’s expected that I’d have to perform because the backrow are all playing well.”</p>
      <p>Some things don’t change.</p>
