      <p>It was a partnership that the WWE Universe was skeptical about from the get-go, but over the last few months, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/nikki-cross">Nikki Cross</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/ranking-the-top-10-nxt-alumni-of-the-decade/6">Alexa Bliss</a> have proven to be true friends. This goes for the inside of the ring as well as outside of it.</p>
      <p>Nikki Cross recently spoke to <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a29828381/wwe-nikki-cross-alexa-bliss-tag-team">Digital Spy </a>about her budding friendship with 'The Goddess' where she said the two always got along while on NXT together, but the real bond started to form once they were both on Monday Night RAW.</p>
      <blockquote>It just started off with us getting coffee together, then driving together and travelling together and just basically being on the road together.</blockquote>
      <p>The chemistry grew strong enough backstage that Cross says it only made sense to bring their friendship to the TV screen.</p>
      <blockquote>It was kinda what was basically happening in real life was us coming together and then working together and getting to know each other and getting to find out little things about each other. Basically life imitated art and art imitated life there.</blockquote>
      <p>Bliss and Cross won the WWE Women's Tag Team Championships from The IIconics back in August. They held onto the belts for a little over two months, before dropping them to the Kabuki Warriors.</p>

      <p>Bliss is currently missing time due to an undisclosed injury but is expected to return soon. Once she does, Cross says they are committed to keeping the team together.</p>
      <blockquote>We really want to be the first-ever two-time WWE Women’s Tag Team Champions. We’re 100% dedicated to keeping that team going and exploring it even more and showcasing it even more.</blockquote>
      <p>In the meantime, Nikki Cross is getting ready for Survivor Series. She'll be part of Team SmackDown in the 5 on 5 on 5 Women's Elimination Match.</p>
