      <p>There was drama yesterday at the Kwale Custodial Centre, Ndokwa West Local Government Area of Delta State after a plea by Friday Eluhu, a sacked security aide to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, was turned down by the state  Chief Judge, Justice Marshal Umukoro.</p>
      <p>Eluhu and his accomplice were allegedly caught in a viral video footage earlier this year assaulting a lady after stripping her naked for allegedly insulting him.</p>
      <p>Justice Umukoro turned down Eluhu’s plea for mercy, saying “a woman was stripped of her dignity and reduced to a state of inhumanity.”</p>
      <p>Eluhu, 47, is charged along with two others Onyeachukwu Nebo France, 22, and Anom Victor Ewere, 33,  for alleged conspiracy, kidnapping, unlawful detention and attempted murder.</p>

      <p>The trio were remanded at the Kwale Custodial Centre since February 18, 2019.</p>
      <p>Eluhu, who was on his knees, attributed his travails to the handiwork of his enemies as well as an alleged high-level conspiracy against him.</p>
      <p>He told Justice Umukoro he had already initiated an out-of-court settlement with the victim’s family.</p>
      <p>Eluhu said his children lacked parental care in his absence.</p>
