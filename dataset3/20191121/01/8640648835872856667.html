      <p>The Westgate sportsbook made James Holzhauer the favorite Wednesday to win the “Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time” tournament, an ABC special event that will debut Jan. 7.</p>
      <p>Holzhauer opened as the plus 125 favorite over Ken Jennings (+175) and Brad Rutter (+300) in the showdown of the three leading money winners in the history of the game show. But the odds are for entertainment purposes only.</p>
      <p>The Westgate asked the Nevada Gaming Control Board about taking bets on the tournament. But the state requires requests for approval to accept wagers on a nontraditional event to be submitted by a book at least 30 days before the event.</p>
      <p>That ruled out the “Jeopardy!” tournament, which Westgate vice president of risk Jeff Sherman said will be taped in early December.</p>
      <p>“They seemed to be receptive to us inquiring, but there just wasn’t enough lead time for us to apply to do it,” Sherman said.</p>
      <p>According to Michael Lawton, a NGCB senior research analyst, the board received a request for wagers on the Academy Awards in 2017, but that request was denied.</p>
      <p>Offshore books already are accepting wagers on the “Jeopardy!” event. BetOnline made Holzhauer a minus 200 favorite over Rutter (+175) and Jennings (+225).</p>
      <p>Bovada listed Holzhauer as the plus 125 favorite over Rutter (+150) and Jennings (+190) on Wednesday after Rutter opened as the plus 280 third choice behind Holzhauer (+110) and Jennings (+115).</p>
      <p>Holzhauer, 35, won $2.46 million during a 32-game win streak on the show this year and made $250,000 for winning the recent <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/betting/las-vegan-james-holzhauer-wins-jeopardy-tournament-of-champions-1894048/">Tournament of Champions</a> to bring his total winnings to $2,712,216.</p>
      <p>Jennings, 45, compiled a record 74-game win streak in 2004 and has won a total of $3,370,700 on the show.</p>
      <p>Rutter, 41, has total winnings of $4,688,436 and has never lost a game of “Jeopardy!” to a human opponent. He and Jennings lost to a computer in a 2011 match.</p>
      <p>“Holzhauer is playing aggressively and will be very tough to beat, while Jennings and Rutter, though successful, were winners more than a decade ago,” BetOnline sportsbook manager Dave Mason said.</p>
      <p>The first contestant to win three games in the series of hourlong specials will earn the $1 million grand prize. The runners-up will take home $250,000 each.</p>
      <p>The matches will air Jan. 7 to 9. If necessary, additional games will air Jan. 10 and Jan. 14 to 16.</p>
