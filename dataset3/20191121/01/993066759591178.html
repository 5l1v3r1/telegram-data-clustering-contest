      <p>THE Institute of Directors Northern Ireland (IoD NI) has launched its new professional development programme for 2020.</p>
      <p>Courses are delivered by the IoD academy, which provides training across a broad range of corporate disciplines and aims to raise standards of excellence among the north's business leaders.</p>
      <p>The launch of dates for the 2020 programme comes as the latest tranche of local leaders achieve chartered director status, the academy's flagship qualification.</p>
      <p>IoD NI Chairman Gordon Milligan said: “Courses at the IoD Academy, led by industry experts, are designed to help leaders to improve their own skill set, thereby enabling them to grow their business and make a real impact on the wider economy.</p>
      <p>“Providing participants with a solid understanding of the role of a director - focusing on areas such as strategy, marketing, finance and legal responsibilities – the courses are a tremendous platform from which leaders can greatly improve their day-to-day decision-making and contribution.”</p>
      <p>Upcoming modules, all of which take place in the Merchant Hotel, Belfast, include the role of the director and the board from February 10-11, finance for non-finance directors from March 23-25, and strategy for directors from April 27-29.</p>
      <p>An accelerated course will also take place from June 14-19 June at a five-star residential resort.</p>
      <p>The courses go towards achieving a certificate in company direction, the first step toward becoming a chartered director.</p>
      <p>“To become a chartered director is one of the highest accolades available to local business leaders," continued Mr Milligan.</p>
      <p>“As an internationally-recognised qualification, it demonstrates the desire of the business community in Northern Ireland to be the best that they can be which helps to make the region an attractive proposition for investors.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to all those that have recently made the mark and I look forward to welcoming the next group of Chartered Directors once they complete the qualification through the IoD Academy.”</p>
      <p>More than 60 Northern Ireland leaders now hold the chartered director status, with the latest to have reached the mark including Sam Waide, Health and Social Care Northern Ireland, Anne Donaghy, Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, Stephen Kearney, Fitzpatrick &amp; Kearney, and Jack Peel, Fusion Heating.</p>
