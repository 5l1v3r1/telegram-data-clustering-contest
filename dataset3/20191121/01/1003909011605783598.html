      <h1>Trudeau cabinet targets western anger, but it's only the beginning</h1>

      <p>Community leaders in Alberta say attempts to address regional divisions through Justin Trudeau’s new cabinet are only a start, with more action needed to satisfy frustrated Albertans.</p>
      <p>The federal cabinet unveiled Wednesday <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/newsalert-justin-trudeau-unveils-new-cabinet-focused-on-domestic-challenges/wcm/294b4084-3166-4ff2-bc3a-d6c882ebbcbc">includes Alberta-born Chrystia Freeland</a>, who represents a Toronto riding, as intergovernmental affairs minister and deputy prime minister.</p>
      <p>North Vancouver MP Jonathan Wilkinson, who was raised in Saskatchewan, was named environment minister.</p>
      <p>Winnipeg MP Jim Carr, a minister over the past four years who is now being treated for cancer, <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/news-pmn/canada-news-pmn/newsalert-justin-trudeau-unveils-new-cabinet-focused-on-domestic-challenges/wcm/294b4084-3166-4ff2-bc3a-d6c882ebbcbc">is no longer in cabinet</a>. He will instead serve as a “special representative for the Prairies” to “ensure that the people of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba have a strong voice in cabinet.”</p>
      <p>Trudeau’s Liberals were shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan in last month’s federal election.</p>
      <p>Mount Royal University political scientist Lori Williams said the roster shows Trudeau is “taking very seriously the issue of regionalism.”</p>
      <p>“What we’re seeing is that there will likely be a number of different ministers reaching out to representatives from these provinces in Parliament, but also reaching out directly in their capacities as ministers . . . to respond to some of the concerns that we’re seeing expressed so passionately,” Williams said.</p>
      <p>Alberta Premier Jason Kenney singled out Freeland, Carr, and new Natural Resources Minister Seamus O’Regan as those his provincial government looked forward to working with.</p>
      <p>“With no ministers from Alberta, I hope that ministers with portfolios of especially urgent interest to our province will listen to Albertans, take our concerns seriously, and work constructively with the Alberta government to address them,” Kenney said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“We have much to discuss with the Prime Minister and his new cabinet on these and other items we have already set out in letters and public communications since the federal election. Our government will be a strong voice for Alberta in Ottawa and with other provinces and territories, explaining the importance of Alberta’s economy to the national economy and making the case for a Fair Deal for Alberta within Canada.”</p>

      <p>Kenney said such work “takes on new urgency,” which he’d look to highlight next month during a meeting in Ottawa with Trudeau.</p>
      <p>The Calgary Chamber of Commerce released a list of priorities it planned to tackle alongside members of the new cabinet.</p>
      <p>President and CEO Sandip Lalli said it would work with Wilkinson and O’Regan “on the development of environment and climate change policies that stimulate competition and promote innovation in Canada’s natural resource sector.”</p>
      <p>Lalli also noted the need for “expansion of market access and removal of international and internal trade barriers to Canadian goods and services.”</p>
      <p>“As we begin this new chapter, let us move forward with vision and decisive action to ensure Canada is competitive, relevant, and nationally and globally responsible,” she stated.</p>
      <p>But regardless of who is in cabinet, solutions to Alberta’s woes must be a priority for the prime minister himself, according to Canada West Foundation president and CEO Martha Hall Findlay.</p>
      <p>“There are things that can be fixed, there are actions that can be taken, but they have to come from the prime minister,” she said.</p>
      <p>“One of the reasons we’re at this very difficult time now is that there clearly was not enough recognition or true listening, or true heeding, of the warnings about C-48 and C-69 (two federal bills that were criticized as adding obstacles to getting Alberta’s natural resources to international markets). Unless that changes and unless the prime minister actually takes responsibility for this . . . it puts way too much pressure on these individuals. They’re not magicians.”</p>
      <p>Hall Findlay praised Carr’s appointment, noting he’s well respected in Western Canada.</p>
      <p>“The problem is, is he going to be heard and listened to by the PMO? Let’s not forget we’re at a point of real frustration in Saskatchewan and Alberta in particular,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We got here while Jim Carr was in cabinet, as was Ralph Goodale, as were two Alberta representatives, so if we think that’s going to be some magic bullet, that’s unfair to Jim Carr. That puts way too much on his shoulders. This is the prime minister’s responsibility.”</p>
