      <p>A gold mining firm has confirmed it withdrew sponsorship from a business awards event in Co Tyrone.</p>
      <p>Dalradian Gold was not involved in the Mid Ulster Business Excellence Awards held in Clogher last night.</p>
      <p>The firm did not give a reason for its decision but it comes after Mid Ulster District Council wrote to organisers to “highlight the widespread concern and community opposition to gold mining in the Sperrins and asked that reflection should be placed on this when accepting sponsorship of awards categories and sponsorship generally for the Business Awards”.</p>
      <p>A council spokeswoman said it was also agreed to write to all sponsors involved in the event “making them aware of the community and council opposition to Dalradian”.</p>
      <p>Canadian-owned Dalradian Gold wants to develop a mine at Greencastle, near Omagh, which some local people are opposed to.</p>
      <p>Campaigners had indicated their intention to protest at the awards event.</p>
      <p>Sinn Féin councillor Ronan McGinley, who proposed that the letter be sent, tweeted: “Delighted to say that Dalradian is no longer a sponsor."</p>
      <p>Independent councillor Dan Kerr also claimed that “Dalradian are trying to normalise themselves to the community in Greencastle and surrounding areas".</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Dalradian said: “As a local employer since 2009, we had hoped to support the wider business community through the awards, particularly as 13 per cent of all jobs in the Mid Ulster Council area are related to the extraction and processing of natural resources. Our focus, however, is on ensuring that the awards celebrate the best of local business.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, anti-gold mine campaigners have said they will lodge a formal complaint after claiming they were refused entry to a public council meeting.</p>
      <p>Campaigners claim they were initially allowed into the Fermanagh and Omagh District Council meeting at the Townhall in Enniskillen earlier this month but later refused re-entry after temporarily leaving the chamber.</p>
      <p>A video of the incident has been posted on social media.</p>
      <p>Campaigner Martin Tracey said: All communities have the right to hear how they are being represented. There will be a formal complaint lodged.”</p>
      <p>Independent councillor Emmet McAleer said: “From my perspective it's a worrying development - these meetings are supposed to be for the public and open to the public and they are denied access to them.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Fermanagh and Omagh District Council said: “The anti-goldmine protesters were not refused re-entry to the council meeting on November 5 2019 in the Townhall Enniskillen.</p>
      <p>“Those in attendance had an opportunity to attend the meeting in accordance with the council's 'Conduct and Behaviour of Visitors to Fermanagh and Omagh District Council's Civic Buildings Protocol'.”</p>
