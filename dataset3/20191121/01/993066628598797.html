      <p>ACCORDING to lovable snowman Olaf (voiced by Josh Gad), who is a permafrosted font of wisdom about the natural world, water has memory.</p>
      <p>Considering that audiences who flocked to the original Frozen are largely made of water, it's safe to assume that their memories of Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee's Oscar-winning adventure will ebb and flow throughout this visually stunning sequel to the highest-grossing animated film of all time.</p>
      <p>Water and the other classical elements – air, earth and fire – play pivotal roles in Frozen II.</p>
      <p>The realistic movement of aqua has always been a chink in the armour of computer animators. Not so here.</p>
      <p>Disney's platoons of digital wizards repeatedly quench our thirst with jaw-dropping set pieces including a thrilling gallop over crashing waves of an angry sea astride an untamed water horse.</p>
      <p>We've had six years to commit to memory every note, key change and lyrical flip of Do You Want To Build A Snowman?, For The First Time In Forever, Love Is An Open Door and Let It Go.</p>
      <p>It would be churlish to expect returning songwriters Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez to ride the crest of those sound waves again on a first listen.</p>
      <p>In the sequel, Elsa's call to arms Into The Unknown soars to dizzying high notes and Kristoff's faux 1990s rock ballad Lost In The Woods is a hoot, replete with four-legged backing singers.</p>
      <p>Anna's solo The Next Right Thing is a beautifully melancholic distillation of grief.</p>
      <p>Three years have passed since Elsa (Idina Menzel) ascended the throne of Arendelle.</p>
      <p>An ethereal voice from the enchanted forest beckons her to unlock the secret of a bedtime story told to Elsa and sister Anna (Kristen Bell) by their parents, King Agarr (Alfred Molina) and Queen Iduna (Evan Rachel Wood).</p>
      <p>"The truth must be found. Without it, there is no future," confirms troll king Grand Pabbie (Ciaran Hinds).</p>
      <p>Thus, Elsa, Anna and her goofy beau Kristoff (Jonathan Groff), reindeer Sven and Olaf journey to an ancient stone circle shrouded in swirling mist, which designates a hidden pathway to the supposedly lost Northuldra tribe.</p>
      <p>Frozen II dilutes a conventional quest storyline to wring out the running time to 103 minutes.</p>
      <p>Inveterate scene-stealer Olaf hysterically recaps the first film in the sequel's crowd-pleasing showpiece and finds a perfect match for his gosh-darn cuteness in a blue salamander sidekick.</p>
      <p>While the first film encouraged characters to let go of things that hurt or hinder – fear, self-doubt, regret, the past – Buck and Lee's follow-up dives deeper into their tearful self-reflection.</p>
      <p>Menzel and Bell gently tug heartstrings as sisterly bonds strain and their brave heroines make sacrifices to remedy a great injustice.</p>
      <p>"I've had my adventure/I don't need something new," defiantly trills Elsa.</p>
      <p>Legions of fans do, and, despite its flimsy plot, Frozen II largely delivers.</p>
