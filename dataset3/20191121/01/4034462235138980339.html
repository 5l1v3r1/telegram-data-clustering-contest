      <h1>2020 Genesis G90 Arrives With Even More Luxury</h1>
      <h2>The G90 gets an extensive makeover for the new model year.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:05:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:05</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>Genesis' flagship model, the elegant and well-engineered G90, impressed us when we drove it earlier this year. Make no mistake, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/genesis/g90">Genesis G90</a> is already a high-end car for less money than others would charge for. Now, for 2020 Genesis has gone to town on the G90 to bring an even better experience to the luxury car market. Something <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/official-radical-genesis-g90-facelift-coming-to-la-auto-show">we were waiting to hear about was the engine options</a>, and we're pleased to see that Genesis is remaining committed to its smooth 5.0-liter V8 engine making 420 horsepower and 383 lb-ft. of torque. The 3.3-liter turbocharged V6 also carries on, still making 365 horsepower.</p>

      <p>Design-wise, Genesis has applied its G-Matrix design language, inspired by light reflecting from an illuminating diamond, heavily. It's there in the headlights and taillights and the optional, 19-inch wheels. Genesis is seeking to launch a "product offensive" with emotive design and exceptional design, and it's impossible to deny the new "Crest Grille" isn't emotive as it's flanked by the "Quad Lamps." Something we also see on the outside is how Genesis has emphasized the low and wide stance and used different lines to create an even more stately silhouette than the 2019 model. Genesis is also promising an extended color palette inside and out.</p>

      <p>Inside, Genesis is touting what it calls the Horizontal Architecture ethos, based on a "harmonious flow of horizontal surfaces". The elegant lines are capped with open-pore wood, authentic chrome plating, leather wrapping, and double stitching and piping throughout the cabin.</p>
      <p>Technology is also key to the Genesis flagship, and the G90 is the first Genesis vehicle to offer over-the-air wireless updates for maps and software. Those maps are shown on a 12.3-inch display, and the infotainment system comes standard with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The G90 also uses Active Noise Cancellation along with the adaptive control suspension to minimize noise and vibration in the cabin.</p>

      <p>Something that impressed us on the 2019 Genesis model was the sheer wealth of standard features that would be expensive boxes to tick on similar cars. This year is no different, and on top of the features mentioned above, new driver assistance features debut on the G90, including lane follow assist, rear cross-traffic collision-avoidance, forward collision-avoidance, safe exit assist, and lane-keep assist.</p>
      <p>Genesis is also offering 3 years/36,000 miles of complimentary scheduled maintenance and valet service, as well as 3 years of Genesis Connected Services, SiriusXM Travel Link, and a lifetime of its traffic data service. No price has been announced just yet, but we expect it to creep just above the $70,000 mark.</p>
