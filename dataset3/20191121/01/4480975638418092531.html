      <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) now holds a staggering 43.5% of all outstanding Japanese government debt, <a href="https://twitter.com/jsblokland/status/1197263374242996225">Jeroen Blokland</a>,  Portfolio Manager for the Robeco Multi-Asset funds, Robeco ONE and Robeco Pension Return Portfolio, tweeted on Thursday. </p>
      <p>The central bank unleashed a massive quantitative easing program in April 2013. Under the QE plan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) vowed to buy ¥7 trillion of government bonds each month using electronically created money.</p>
      <p>The QE program is in its sixth year. Even so, the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/boj">BOJ</a> remains miles away from its 2% inflation target. </p>
      <p>If anything, the QE program seems to have distorted markets. Also, with BOJ owning more than 43% of government debt, there is limited scope for further monetary stimulus. </p>
      <p>Put simply, the BOJ is going to have a tough time battling bullish pressures around the JPY during the next round of <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment/risk-appetite">risk aversion</a>. </p>
