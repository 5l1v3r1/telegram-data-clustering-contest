      <h1>Redskins Fall in Haskins First Start at FedEx Field</h1>

      <p><b>LANDOVER, MD –</b> Dwayne Haskins started his first game at FedEx Field on Sunday. The 22-year-old Rookie QB ended the game 19 for 35 throwing for a total of 214 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception. His inability to deliver in the red zone played a part in the 9th loss of the season for the Redskins. He didn’t get much help from his offensive line who allowed 6 sacks as the Jet’s defense took their turns hitting the rookie.</p>

      <p>On the bright side, the young Redskins trio of Dwayne Haskins, Derrius Guice, and Terry McLaurin all made big plays and showed some Redskins faithful a glimpse of what is to come in future seasons.</p>

      <p>Derrius Guice who played his first game since tearing his meniscus in Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles caught a 45-yard screen pass for a touchdown. The touchdown was the Redskins first in 16 quarters, and also Guice’s first NFL touchdown.</p>
