      <h1>Greg Bird’s time with Yankees is also over</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:47:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:47</time> by <a rel="author">Ted Holmlund</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/yankees-strongly-consider-releasing-jacoby-ellsbury/">Jacoby Ellsbury</a> is not the only Yankee whose run is coming to an end.</p>
      <p>The team designated oft-injured <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/greg-birds-future-with-yankees-is-at-its-crossroads/">first baseman Greg Bird</a> for assignment on Wednesday, along with left-handed reliever Nestor Cortes Jr.</p>
      <p>The Bombers had an 8 p.m. deadline to set their 40-man roster, and Bird was not on it.</p>
      <p>The Yankees still have a chance to trade the left-handed hitter because when a player’s contract is designated for assignment (DFA’d), he can either be traded or placed on irrevocable outright waivers within seven days of the transaction.</p>
      <p>This was not the ending many in the Yankees organization expected for Bird, who was considered one of the team’s building blocks a couple of seasons ago.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Bird filled in well for Mark Teixeira by hitting .261 with 11 homers, 31 RBIs and a .872 OPS in 46 games, but a slew of injuries have short-circuited his career.</p>
      <p>Bird missed the entire 2016 season because of right shoulder surgery and was limited to a combined 130 games in 2017 and 2018 because of surgeries on his right ankle. This past season, Bird appeared in 10 games before going on the injured list on April 16 with a tear in his left plantar fascia and missed the rest of the season. He played in seven games for Gigantes in the Dominican Winter League to reacclimate himself to baseball activities and went 3-for-24 (.125).</p>
      <p>As for Ellsbury, the release of the 36-year-old means the Yankees will swallow the $26 million remaining on the seven-year, $153 million free-agent contract the center fielder signed prior to the 2014 season.</p>
