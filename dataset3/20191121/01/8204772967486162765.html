      <p>Sir,– I wrote to Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the Ceann Comhairle in Leinster House asking him to get agreement not to turn on Christmas lights this year at Leinster House because of the appalling situation of the homeless.</p>
      <p>I was thinking of the little boy eating his dinner off cardboard at the time, but Kitty Holland’s piece (<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/homeless-children-experiencing-significant-mental-health-difficulties-1.4088670">Home News</a>, November 20th) is truly heart breaking.</p>
      <p>It tells us of damage being done to mental health of homeless children, a thing I have suspected would happen as a mother and grandmother myself.</p>
      <p>I am asking readers to also contact Leinster House on this matter as I believe it would bring home to the Oireachtas the damage being done. The Cabinet are collectively responsible under the Constitution. – Yours, etc,</p>
