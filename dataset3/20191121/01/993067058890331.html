      <p>OPPORTUNISTIC thieves are in the wrong place at the wrong time, sparking a night-time police manhunt through the streets of Manhattan, in Brian Kirk's propulsive action thriller.</p>
      <p>Screenwriters Adam Mervis and Matthew Michael Carnahan milk droplets of dramatic tension from their simple and efficient set-up, running a stopwatch on the frenetic gun fights and car chases from the moment the lead investigating officer reminds colleagues: "If we don't catch these guys in the next three to four hours, they vanish."</p>
      <p>On-screen time checks cleanly convey the relentless passage of time from the first pull of a trigger to the cacophony of a bullet-riddled final reckoning that poses uncomfortable questions about the fractious relationship between taxpayers and the people entrusted to protect them.</p>
      <p>Chadwick Boseman trades Black Panther's figure-hugging Vibranium weave mesh suit for more simple, functional attire as a morally incorruptible NYPD detective, who has been raised to never shy away from doing the right thing and to always "look the devil in the eye".</p>
      <p>He is often the fulcrum of impeccably staged action sequences including a breathless pursuit on foot through the Subway transit system.</p>
      <p>Michael (Stephan James) and his military-trained buddy Ray (Taylor Kitsch) receive a tip-off that a swanky restaurant in New York is a temporary hold for a 30kg shipment of cocaine.</p>
      <p>The low-level criminals storm the premises after hours and point automatic weapons at a lone waiter, who eventually gives Michael and Ray a key to the downstairs safe.</p>
      <p>Inside, the shocked duo find a whopping 300kg of white powder.</p>
      <p>A police patrol arrives as the trigger-happy duo escape with considerably more than they came for.</p>
      <p>Eight serving officers perish in a hail of bullets and Ray and Michael flee to Chinatown to offload their stash via a high-class money launderer (Alexander Siddig)</p>
      <p>Flashing blue and red lights of the NYPD flood the crime scene.</p>
      <p>Detective Andre Davis (Boseman), son of a decorated cop who was killed in the line of duty, is assigned to lead the manhunt by Captain McKenna (JK Simmons).</p>
      <p>Andre proposes a bold plan of action â€“ the temporary closure of all 21 bridges out of Manhattan and a suspension of train and subway services, trapping the killers on the island.</p>
      <p>Flanked by ballsy narcotics division officer Frankie Burns (Sienna Miller), Andre screeches into Chinatown to apprehend Ray and Michael, using lethal force if necessary.</p>
      <p>21 Bridges shoots to thrill on familiar territory, emboldened by Boseman's portrayal of a stoic and softly spoken man of honour, who brandishes his badge as a symbol of righteous authority.</p>
      <p>Northern Irish director Kirk is a willing accomplice to explosive skirmishes beneath the gleaming glass and metal of a cityscape that never sleeps.</p>
      <p>With a sleek 99-minute running time, there's no time for us to slumber.</p>
