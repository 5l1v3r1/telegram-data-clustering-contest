      <h1>NHLPA files grievance challenging Winnipeg Jets' suspension of Dustin Byfuglien, per report</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:20:24+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:20</time> by <a rel="author">Tommy McArdle</a></address>
      <p>The NHLPA on Wednesday filed a grievance on behalf of Winnipeg Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien challenging his suspension from the team, <a href="https://twitter.com/PierreVLeBrun/status/1197300205965713408">according to a report</a> from The Athletic's Pierre Lebrun.</p>
      <p>The Jets suspended Byfuglien, 34, in September<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/jets-reportedly-suspend-dustin-byfuglien-to-protect-cap-flexibility-roster-space/b0tjfb6aj9i51adycajbwkoei">to protect salary cap flexibility</a>after a preseason leave of absence raised questions about<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/winnipeg-jets-dustin-byfuglien-mulling-nhl-future-amid-leave-of-absence/mfq13xuei3kp1pgdg53lsoijy">whether he will continue playing in the NHL</a> at all. Byfuglien never reported to the team for training camp or the regular season, andhe islisted as "suspended without pay" by <a href="https://www.capfriendly.com/teams/jets">CapFriendly</a>for this reason — allowing Byfuglien's $7.6 million contract to not count against the team's salary cap.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nhl/news/winnipeg-jets-dustin-byfuglien-undergoes-ankle-surgery-nhl-future-remains-up-in-the-air/lxcc4t9zih4712a1m2f3z7aw8">It was reported in October</a> that the lumbering, physical defenseman underwent ankle surgery that could keep him out through at least the remainder of the calendar year.Jets general manager Kevin Cheveldayoff told reporters at the time that the team was aware Byfuglien had considered surgery, but that the team had played no role in his decision.</p>
      <p>Byfuglien's contract expires after the 2019-20 season. In 42 games last year, he scored 31 points in 42 games played and heavily featured on Winnipeg's blue line (24:22 minutes played per game).</p>
