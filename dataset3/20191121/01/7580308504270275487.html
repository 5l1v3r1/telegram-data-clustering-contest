      <h1>UNN students deplore conference on witchcraft</h1>

      <p>Many students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), last weekend rose to speak against the upcoming conference organised by the B.I.C Ijomah Centre for policy and research in UNN tagged “Witchcraft.”</p>
      <p>The conference, scheduled to take place on campus next week, has generated criticisms from different quarters as many queried the concept behind such meeting.</p>
      <p>However, as the scheduled date draws nearer, members of the university community, including young and old are kicking against the conference. While some engaged in online protests, others are making it prayer points. With many posters going around the university’s environment carrying inscriptions such as “we plead the blood of Jesus over UNN. We reject all forms of witchcraft overtly or covertly in Jesus name, Amen.”</p>
      <p>But the President of the Students Union Government (SUG), Chimezie Fortunatus, who spoke to The Guardian on the issue expressed that contrary to various opinions on the upcoming conference on witchcraft, he believes the academia should be open to any form of discussion. “I do not see anything wrong with the proposed topic of discussion, it is supposed to increase our knowledge on the topic and not promote its practice. We are in a learning environment and are supposed to be open to anything new,” he said.</p>
