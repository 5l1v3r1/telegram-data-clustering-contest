      <h1>Terrell Owens Slams Stephen A. Smith For His Comments About Colin Kaepernick (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Terrell Owens is among the many folks who are still criticizing Stephen A. Smith for his comments that suggested Colin Kaepernick “doesn’t want to play football, he wants to be a martyr.”</p>
      <p>The Pro Football Hall of Famer texted Smith personally to let him know how wrong he was.</p>
      <p>“T.O. — Terrell Owens — just sent me a text. ‘You have no idea what you’re talking about. You’re quick to bash. That’s why people say what they say about you.’ Even T.O. is on my case right now. You know, I will respond to him and all the folks that feel the way that they feel in just a second. Because there’s a whole lot of people that are coming at me with emotion. I’m going to come at folks with facts,” Smith said Tuesday on the show.</p>

      <p>Not included in the video were the remarks he directed at Owens:</p>
      <p>Smith responded to Owens by saying, “T.O. sends me a damn text just now. T.O.! How many times have I come to the defense of Terrell Owens? OK? How many times have I talked about how unfairly he has been maligned? How people have insulted him? How this man deserved to be a first-ballot Hall of Famer? But by the way, T.O. wasn’t asking to go to the Hall of Fame ceremony or anything like that. T.O. — Terrell Owens … was maligned unnecessarily and unfairly, and I pointed that out.”</p>
      <p>Stephen A. pretty much bashed Kaepernick for not showing up to the workout that was scheduled at the Falcons training facility and moving the venue an hour away at a high school.</p>
      <p>“The fact that he did not show up, to me, eradicates his points altogether. From the standpoint of ‘the NFL, I’m looking for a job, running from the truth,’ and all this nonsense. His ‘I have a dream’ speech that he gave to the media and the public Saturday.”</p>
