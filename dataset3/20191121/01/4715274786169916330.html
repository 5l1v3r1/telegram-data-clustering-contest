      <h1>2 Cabinet men face Duterte’s ax</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">MJ Blancaflor</a></address>
      <p>President Rodrigo Duterte said Tuesday night he would fire the two Cabinet secretaries purportedly linked to corruption if allegations against them would be proven true.</p>
      <p>President Duterte said he had already seen the report submitted by the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission in late October on the complaint against sitting Cabinet officials he refused to name.</p>
      <p>“I should know, actually, if you are corrupt, because I will summon you to my office and we will have a one-on-one talk,” Duterte said.</p>
      <p>“If proven true, I’ll fire you. That’s for sure…But let us observe due process,” he added.</p>
      <p>PACC Greco Belgica earlier said the two sitting Cabinet officials have been accused of violating Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act based on the complaints filed.</p>
      <p>He also said one of the complaints was filed by an official from the Cabinet secretary’s department while the other was submitted by a private citizen.</p>
      <p>The two unidentified Cabinet members, Belgica said, have been cooperating with PACC investigators as the commission conducted a lifestyle check and probe on them which began in February.</p>
      <p>Duterte has repeatedly said he would not tolerate even a “whiff” of corruption from any government employee, but he was also criticized for reappointing sacked officials to other government posts.</p>
