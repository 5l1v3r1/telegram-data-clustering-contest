      <h1>FUTO holds first computer-based exam in history</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:34:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:34</time> by <a rel="author">Chiamaka Ukachukwu</a></address>
      <p>Federal University of Technology, Owerri (FUTO) recorded its first-ever major computer-based exam in the just concluded 2018/2019 session examination. Apart from post-Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), the institution never had more than two papers of its exams as computer-based.</p>
      <p>Although the CBT examination started with 100 level students, other undergraduates lauded the move, which they described as the beginning of a new era in the university.A student, Okechukwu Prince told The Guardian that they had just one exam in CBT, which was a complete disaster, so they stopped it, and has not been any computer-based examination till now.</p>
      <p>Another student, Onyegbule Emmanuel, described the development as a good one, saying it is an indication that the school is advancing in technology. Emmanuel said, “It is a welcome development. I believe that it would reduce the menace of malpractice, even though it delayed their exams”.However, some undergraduates described it as too stressful, adding if a school does not have over 1,000 computers, it would just delay the exams and that is more stress for us.”</p>
