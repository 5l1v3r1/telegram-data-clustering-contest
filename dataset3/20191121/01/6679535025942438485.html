      <h1>Pakistan vs Australia 1st test | Pakistan win toss, choose to bat</h1>
      <h2>As expected, Pakistan will give 16-year-old pace sensation Naseem Shah his first cap, making him one of the youngest players in Test history</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T01:40:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 01:40</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Pakistan captain Azhar Ali won the toss and chose to bat in the first cricket Test in hot and humid conditions at the Gabba in Brisbane on November 21.</p>
      <p>As expected, Pakistan will give <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pakistan-set-to-unleash-16-year-old-fast-bowler-naseem-shah-on-australia/article30027248.ece">16-year-old pace sensation Naseem Shah</a> his first cap, making him one of the youngest players in Test history. Shah, who decided to remain on tour after his mother died last week, made the team after impressing with an eight-over spell against Australia A in a lead-up game in Perth.</p>
      <p>Pakistan omitted experienced paceman Mohammad Abbas in favour of the players who performed so well against Australia A.</p>
      <p>Australia have recalled opener Joe Burns to partner with David Warner at the top of the order and middle-order batsman Travis Head.</p>
      <p>"There's a bit of grass on the pitch but it looks a good pitch to bat on, especially if you get through the new ball then there will be lots of runs in it," Azhar said. "We're really excited to see Naseem play. It was very emotional this morning when he got his cap.</p>
      <p>"It was difficult to leave out Mohammad Abbas but sometimes form can take over and we know he's very good and our number one bowler, but at the moment these three pacers are doing the job and we picked them."</p>
