      <p>Former president of Ireland Mary McAleese has written to the Papal Nuncio and Archbishop Eamon Martin over an article in the Irish Catholic newspaper.</p>
      <p>The former president has also written to Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin and the owner of the Irish Catholic newspaper, Garry O’Sullivan.</p>
      <p>It is understood Ms McAleese penned the letters after she was challenged over her interpretation of writings by Pope John Paul II during an address at Trinity College in Dublin, where she is chancellor.</p>
      <p>Ms McAleese, <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/04/news/former-president-mary-mcaleese-calls-on-catholic-church-to-allow-women-to-become-deacons-1755296/">who has come into conflict with the Catholic church in the past</a>, has been critical of the Irish Catholic.</p>

      <p>Editor Michael Kelly referred to Mrs McAleese's letter this week on Twitter after it emerged Sean Quinn <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/18/news/association-of-catholic-priests-expresses-support-for-co-cavan-pp-after-sea-n-quinn-complains-to-vatican-1767946/">had written to the Papal Nuncio to complain about his parish priest</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Kelly, who is originally from Omagh, said: “Given that our former president Mrs McAleese has been writing to the Papal Nuncio trying to get me in trouble this is interesting”.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Irish News, Mr Kelly said he was disappointed that the former president had contacted the paper’s owner directly.</p>
      <p>“No-one wants to get a call from the proprietor to say the former president has been in touch,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the intervention has had a “chilling effect” but added that he felt that both he and his paper have been “vindicated”.</p>
