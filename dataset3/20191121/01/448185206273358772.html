      <p>Aries : (March 21 – April 20)</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It is going to be a wonderful day. You will have the stamina and the energy to get your tasks completed. And will work with full dedication and commitment. Don’t keep putting your partner down.  This will be a source of irritation and you will not benefit.  Trying to score brownie points never helps a romance to get better.</p>
