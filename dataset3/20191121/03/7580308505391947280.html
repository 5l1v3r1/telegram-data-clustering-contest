      <p>Imo State government has urged the newly appointed Head of Service (HoS), Dr. Chibuzor Iwuagwu, to promote discipline, accountability, punctuality and increased productivity in the state civil service.</p>
      <p>Governor Emeka Ihedioha, who gave the charge at the swearing-in of Dr. Iwuagwu at Douglas House, Owerri, yesterday, said his administration would not condone any attempt to undermine his efforts towards rebuilding the state.He urged the new HoS to put in his best to ensure a transformed civil service in the state for effective service delivery, high productivity and huge economic returns.</p>
      <p>Ihedioha said, “You are coming at a very challenging time in the fortune of the Imo State Civil Service. You are therefore expected to spearhead government reforms in the service without fear or favour.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to seeing effective service delivery, observance of extant rules and respect for due process in the public service system in the coming months. “The state of the service speaks volume about the readiness of our government to rebuild Imo. We hope you will do your best to satisfy our investment in the civil service by delivering corresponding results.”He threatened to hold the HoS responsible if errant civil servants were protected.</p>
      <p>“We will not tolerate those that want to stay within us and undermine the efforts of our administration to rebuild our state.”In his vote of thanks, Iwuagwu appreciated the governor for finding him worthy for the position and promised that the civil service under his watch would witness great transformation in line with the Rebuild Imo agenda of the government.Iwuagwu, until his new appointment, was a Permanent Secretary. He replaced Mrs. Elma Eluwa.“I will push you; I will drive you; I will wake you up at odd hours,” the governor added.</p>
