      <h1>2021 Chevy Trailblazer Arrives At Dealers In Q1 2020 At Under $20,000</h1>
      <h2>1.2- and 1.3-liter turbo engines power the crossover.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:53:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-karr/" target="_blank">Anthony Karr</a></address>
      <p>General Motors’ latest crossover, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/352095/chevrolet-trailblazer-debuts-compact-suv/">2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer</a>, goes on sale in the spring of 2020 at a starting price of “below $20,000” before taxes and dealer fees. Unfortunately, that’s all the pricing information <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/">Chevy</a> is willing to share at this point, promising more specific trim and option pricing details will be released closer to the on-sale date. Just for a quick comparison, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/ford/ecosport/">Ford EcoSport</a> has a starting price of $20,485 for the 2020 model year, while the comparable <a href="https://www.motor1.com/honda/hr-v/">2020 Honda HR-V</a> stars at $20,820.</p>
      <p>The new <a href="https://www.motor1.com/chevrolet/trailblazer/">Trailblazer</a> is not just very competitively priced as Chevy also promises it delivers “a uniquely youthful, yet functional alternative to the fast-growing small SUV segment.” Translating this into non-marketing language, expect a sporty design combined with enough space for five passengers. Visually, the bold front fascia corresponds with the two-tone roof, which is available in the ACTIV trim level. A sportier-looking RS model is also offered.</p>

      <p>We now also have details about the powertrains of the completely revamped model, which gets 1.2- and 1.3-liter turbo units with up to 155 horsepower (115 kilowatts). Both mills come as standard with a continuously variable transmission with selectable stop/start capability, while the more powerful unit is optionally available with a nine-speed automatic.</p>
      <p>The Trailblazer shares its all-wheel-drive system with the Blazer and Traverse, which means you can deactivate the AWD when its performance is not needed and activate it again for off-roading. The FWD models have three drive modes: Normal, Snow, and Sport.</p>

        <p><b>LOS ANGELES — </b>When it arrives in showrooms in Spring 2020, the 2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer will provide a uniquely youthful, yet functional alternative to the fast-growing small SUV segment.</p>
        <p>Like Chevrolet’s latest line of SUVs, the Trailblazer features a bold front fascia and sports car-inspired rear design. The ACTIV trim package amplifies this sporty style with a two-tone roof, unique front and rear fascia and dual exhaust, along with sport terrain tires and suspension tuning enhancements.</p>
        <p>“Slotting between the Trax and Equinox, the addition of the Trailblazer provides us with a great opportunity to expand the Chevy SUV family to new audiences,” said Steve Majoros, director of Chevrolet passenger car and crossover marketing. “With the new ACTIV trim, plus the sporty RS trim, we can appeal to customers’ varying active lifestyles.”</p>
        <p><b>Design Stands Out from Competition</b><br/>The all-new Trailblazer has a character of its own, bringing a bold and expressive look to the segment, and a new level of personalization.</p>
        <p>“The Trailblazer doesn’t simply let customers express their personal style. It encourages it with uniquely styled trims that allow buyers to select a vehicle that reflects their lifestyle,” said Stuart Norris, design director of global Chevrolet compact SUVs. “Its design is bold, confident and full of personality.”</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer’s exterior styling, which follows in the theme set by the Chevy Blazer, features Chevy’s signature dual-port grille, which gives its face a multilayered, dimensional appearance. The accent bar is integrated with the headlamps, helping to visually widen its stance, while a simulated front skidplate adds a sense of strength.</p>
        <p>ACTIV trim Trailblazers feature a new interpretation of the signature dual-port grille, with a larger opening for a more rugged look. The RS trim features a performance-inspired mesh grille with black Chevy bowtie and unique front splitter elements to define its sporty demeanor.</p>
        <p>The side profile includes taut bodyside lines, a sleek roofline and a bold hood shape to accentuate the Trailblazer’s youthful character. RS and ACTIV trim models boost the visual appeal with standard two-tone roofs. Large, wraparound taillamps seamlessly span the liftgate and bodyside, which adds to the visual width of the Trailblazer, providing a more planted look.</p>
        <p>Inside, the Trailblazer features a driver-focused, dual-cockpit interior design with an integrated center stack. High-quality finishes and stitching are customized to allow for different appearances at each trim level. The center console provides several storage options with up to 3.5 liters of open storage and 4.4 liters of storage under the armrest, as well as dual cupholders.</p>
        <p><b>Suite of Standard Safety and Driver Assistance Features</b><br/>All Trailblazer trims come with a comprehensive list of standard active safety and driver assistance features2, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Forward Collision Alert</li>

          <li>Rear Cross Traffic Alert</li>
          <li>HD Rear Vision Camera</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>ACTIV Tuned for Off-Road Use</b><br/>Trailblazer ACTIV is equipped with unique tires and shock tuning. The ACTIV dampers are tuned to enhance vehicle performance and ride comfort when traveling on gravel roads. The Hankook Sport Terrain 17-inch tires feature an aggressive shoulder design and an all-season tread pattern.</p>
        <p>The front fascia on Trailblazer ACTIV has been revised with the lower section designed for improved ground clearance. Additional exterior differentiation includes two-tone roof, standard roof rails and trapezoid-shaped exhaust tips.</p>
        <p><b>Connectivity and Functionality</b><br/>The Trailblazer will feature Chevy’s latest infotainment system<sup>5</sup>, providing the ability to use two Bluetooth-paired phones<sup>6</sup> concurrently, which enables passengers in the vehicle to use their cellphones hands-free or the driver to use multiple phones hands-free.</p>
        <p>The audio system has available wireless Apple CarPlay<sup>7</sup> and Android Auto8 connectivity and available SiriusXM with 360L<sup>9</sup>, featuring exclusive content, including commercial-free music, interviews, shows and performances. The system even learns customer preferences and shares recommendations based on listening habits. SiriusXM with 360L delivers both a satellite and streaming listening experience with more SiriusXM channels than ever before in the vehicle, plus the ability to make on-demand programming choices.</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer features 40/60 split folding second row seats, which enables the vehicle to accommodate objects up to 8.5 feet long. Overall storage capacity is rated up to 54.4cubic feet<sup>10</sup> with the second row folded. For additional convenience, an available hands-free liftgate, with logo projection improves ease of loading and unloading cargo.</p>
        <p><b>Power and AWD Confidence</b><br/>Powered by either a 1.2L turbo or 1.3L turbo engine, the Trailblazer will deliver up to 155 horsepower. Both engines are mated with a standard Continuously Variable Transmission with selectable stop/start capability. A nine-speed automatic transmission is also available on Trailblazers equipped with the 1.3L engine and all-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer is available with Chevy’s selectable AWD, also found in the Blazer and Traverse. Selectable AWD allows drivers to decide whether to activate their AWD system in off-road or inclement weather situations, or to deactivate when AWD performance is not required, to achieve improved fuel economy.</p>
        <p>Drive modes on front-wheel drive models include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Normal:</b> Tailored for daily commuting and focused on ride comfort</li>
          <li><b>Snow:</b> Provides more progressive throttle input for improved vehicle acceleration on snow- and ice-covered roads</li>
          <li><b>Sport:</b> Modifies steering effort and shifting for a sportier feel and response</li>
        </ul>
        <p>AWD models add unique calibrations for more rear-wheel torque at lower speeds to improve the driving experience on moderately steep and unpaved surfaces.</p>
        <p>The Trailblazer is expected to arrive in U.S. showrooms in spring 2020. Specific trim and option pricing details will be announced closer to launch.</p>
