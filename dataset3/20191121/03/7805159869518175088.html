      <h1>Redmi Note 8 Development Update: POSP and Pixel Experience Custom ROM, Custom Kernel, and TWRP released</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:40:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series is arguably one of the most successful product lineups to come out of the company’s stables. The lower mid-range devices offer reasonable specifications at a very competitive price and the recently launched Redmi Note 8 series is no different. The Redmi Note 8 and Note 8 Pro were <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-redmi-note-8-pro-redmibook-tv-china-launch/">launched in China</a> back in August this year and they <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-8-pro-europe-launch/">made their way to the European market</a> shortly thereafter. In order to promote third-party development for the devices, Xiaomi then <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/redmi-note-8-kernel-sources-available/">released kernel sources</a> for the two devices in September. As expected, development has been on high-gear for both the devices on our forums. Here’s an update on everything new for the Redmi Note 8 that you can get right away:</p>

      <h3>Unofficial <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-twrp/">TWRP</a></h3>
      <p>Developers have now released an unofficial build of the TWRP custom recovery (v3.3.1-2) for the Note 8 which you can flash to replace the stock recovery on your device. Flashing the custom recovery will allow you to install custom ROMs or kernels on your device to improve overall performance. You can download the unofficial TWRP recovery for this device from the link below and follow the instruction in <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/how-to-install-twrp/">this post</a> to flash it on your device.</p>

      <h3>POSP ROM</h3>
      <p>Once you’re done installing TWRP on your device, you’ll be able to flash the POSP custom ROM from the link below. The Android 9 Pie-based AOSP ROM for the Note 8 is a far cry from Xiaomi’s <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/miui/">MIUI</a> and offers a stock Android-like experience with plenty of additional features. As per the comments in the forum post, the ROM seems to be quite stable and all the features are working as expected.</p>

      <h3>Pixel Experience ROM</h3>
      <p>If you are looking for more options, and want to try some of the sweet Pixel goodness, you can also try out Pixel Experience ROM based on <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/androidpie/">Android 9.0</a>.</p>

      <h3>BaeBae Kernel</h3>
      <p>In case you wish to further improve your Note 8’s performance, you can also try out the new BaeBae kernel. However, before you go ahead and flash it on your device, do note that the kernel is currently in its alpha release and it might result in your device getting stuck in a boot loop. In case you have access to the Note 8, you can flash it on your device and share feedback with the kernel developer to help fast track the development process.</p>
