      <p>Briefing journalists after a stakeholders meeting held here yesterday, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry for Natural Resources and Tourism, Prof Adolf Mkenda said the meeting aimed to discuss the best way to constitute the authority to develop beaches in the country.</p>
      <p>He said after going through beach tourism stakeholders contributions, they realised the need to come up with one authority that would oversee development of beaches to attract more tourists.</p>
      <p>“ As we open up new tourism attractions, we have seen the need for one authority to harmonize all operations since there are many government agencies, departments and ministries currently involved in beach management,” he said.</p>
      <p>The PS said there are many authorities like lands ministry, President’s office, Regional Administration and Local Government, fisheries ministry and his ministry, but all these are now working to form one authority.</p>
      <p>Prof Mkenda said initially there was a draft of proposals which have been worked upon in line with beach tourism stakeholders inputs. He added that having many authorities on one thing sometimes cause a lot of confusion.</p>
      <p>He said other countries like Egypt have authorities that develop beaches which attract over 50 percent of tourists in the country. He said, adding that Mauritius also have sustainable beach tourism, hence Tanzania with beaches totaling 1400 kilometres can do better in the tourism sub-sector.</p>
      <p>The PS added that experts have stated that 80 percent of tourists visiting Tanzania come to see animals at the national game parks and reserves, citing the need to increase number of tourists.</p>
      <p>According to the PS, Tanzania is endowed with a lot of tourist attraction sites that only advertise themselves, and many stakeholders are satisfied with the status but a lot more needs to be done if the country is to reap heavily from the tourism sector.<br/>He said for instance, a total of 1.5 million tourists visit Mauritius every year compared to the country’s population of 1.2 million people.</p>
      <p>He said that the government’s efforts to attract more tourists in the country have started yielding positive results as the number of international arrivals visiting the country has risen to 1.5 million in 2018 from 1.3 million in 2017.</p>
      <p>Prof Mkenda said that the number of tourists has increased by 13.5 per cent in the past one year.</p>
      <p>He described the increase as one of the highest to be recorded in the country, noting that in 2018, number of tourists was increased by 6 per cent only, compared to 13.5 percent for Tanzania.</p>
      <p>Prof Mkenda said tourism activities generated $2.4billion last year, an increase of 7.2 per cent from $2.3bn earned in 2017.<br/>According to him, Tanzania is ahead of Kenya when it comes to forex earned from tourism despite the fact that the neighbouring country receives large number of tourists.</p>
      <p>Citing examples, Prof Mkenda said in 2018, Kenya received 2million tourists, but earned US$1.6billion only.</p>
      <p>He however said that statistics show that Tanzania is performing well as it ranks number four for bringing in more foreign Exchange (Forex) from tourism industry in Africa.</p>
      <p>He further noted that an increase in the number of tourists was largely attributed to ongoing promotional efforts coupled with beautiful tourists attractions in the country.</p>
      <p>Prof Mkenda acknowledged the role played by private sector in scaling up tourism through their hefty investments in hotels, transport and other issues in the tourism value chain.</p>
      <p>He also said apart from the achievements, the government can still do more than that.</p>
      <p>Citing the CCM election manifesto, Prof Mkenda said that the target is to register two million tourists by 2020.<br/>“This target is achievable,” he said.</p>
