      <p>Posted to Ivanka's official Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5G4-TYBQb0/?igshid=1p3wuzoth5tx8">account</a>, the pictures offer a good view of Apple's new <a href="https://iphone.appleinsider.com/topic/mac+pro">Mac Pro</a> as it comes off the assembly line at Flextronics' plant in Austin, Texas. <br/><br/>"Introducing @Apple NEW Mac Pro! Proudly Made in the USA!" text accompanying the photos reads. <br/><br/>The president <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/20/tim-cook-touts-american-made-mac-pro-during-factory-tour-with-president-trump">toured the facility</a> on Wednesday as part of a trip designed to highlight job creation in America, and more specifically Apple's U.S. investments.</p>

      <p>While Apple shared a plethora of high quality photos of the machine on its website and in press materials, the computer's packaging has been something of a mystery. Until now. <br/><br/>As seen in Trump's posts, Mac Pro will come in a two-section box that appears to be secured by a cloth strap. Handles in the top box portion offer easy access to the bottom section, which houses the cloth pullouts. <br/><br/>Inside, Mac Pro is protected by Apple's trademark molded paper packing, which in this case is formed into a "honeycomb wave structure" for shock absorption. Judging by the photos, wheels will come preinstalled on models configured with rollers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Mac Pro is due to arrive in December alongside Apple's Pro Display XDR. <br/><br/><b>Update:</b> Donald Trump posted a video of the plant tour <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1197316106236481539?s=20">in a tweet</a>, showing a closer look at the assembly process, as well as detailed views of Mac Pro's packaging design.</p>
