      <h3>Ethereum Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>Recently, there was a downside break in Ethereum below the $180 support against the US Dollar. Moreover, ETH price settled below the $178 support and the 100 hourly simple moving average.</p>
      <p>Later, it found support near the $172 level and started an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/20/ethereum-eth-correcting-higher-but-bears-remain-in-control/">upside correction</a>. There was a break above the $175 resistance area. However, the upward move was capped by the $177-$178 resistance area.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the price failed to stay above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $186 high to $172 low. At the outset, the price is consolidating above the $172 support and facing many hurdles near $176.</p>
      <p>More importantly, there is a new connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $176 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Above the trend line resistance, the 100 hourly simple moving average is near the $178 level to act as a resistance.</p>
      <p>Besides, the main resistance is near the $180 level. It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the last key decline from the $186 high to $172 low. Therefore, Ethereum price must break the $178 and $180 resistance levels to start a decent recovery.</p>
      <p>Conversely, the price could struggle to recover and continue lower below $172. If there is a downside break below the $172 support, the price is likely to accelerate lower towards the $166 and $164 support levels.</p>
      <p>The main support is near the $160 area, where the bulls are likely to take a stand. Any further losses may perhaps push the price towards the $154 level.</p>

      <p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/">chart</a>, Ethereum price is showing a lot of bearish signs below the $178 and $180 resistance levels. Therefore, there remains a risk of more downsides below the $172 support area. Only a close above $180 might negate the bearish view and start a decent recovery in the near term.</p>
