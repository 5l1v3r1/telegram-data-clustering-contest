      <p>ATLANTA -- Sen. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/person/cory-booker">Cory Booker</a>, D-N.J., took a pot shot at former Vice President Joe Biden for his opposition to legalizing marijuana during Wednesday night's <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/democrats">Democratic</a> debate.</p>
      <p>Booker said he was taken aback when he recently heard Biden speak out against legalizing the substance.</p>
      <p>"When I hear him say thatÂ 'I don't think we should legalize marijuana,' I thought you might have been high when you said it," Booker quipped, drawing laughter from the audience.</p>

      <p>Booker went on to explain his position, saying "it is already legal for privileged people," and that it is African Americans who suffer disproportionately for marijuana-related crimes.</p>

      <p>Biden responded by clarifying that he thought "we should decriminalize marijuana, period," but that "we should study what the long term effects are" of marijuana use before legalizing it.</p>
