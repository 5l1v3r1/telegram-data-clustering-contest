      <h1>The Trump campaign loved Tulsi Gabbard's criticism of the Democratic Party</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:11:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Catherine Garcia</a></address>
      <p>That didn't take long.</p>
      <p>Only minutes after Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) criticized the Democratic Party during Wednesday night's primary debate, the Trump War Room Twitter account posted video of her remarks. In the short clip, Gabbard says, "Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by, and for the people."</p>
      <p>The Trump War Room account is managed by Trump's 2020 campaign, and amplifies pro-Trump news stories and Republican talking points. The fact that the Trump War Room posted the video likely won't sit well with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who responded to Gabbard's comment by saying it was "unfortunate" that the Hawaii representative spent "four years full time on Fox News criticizing President Obama" and became buddy-buddy with former Trump adviser Stephen Bannon.</p>
