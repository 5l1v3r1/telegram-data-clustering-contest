      <h1>WWE NXT Results (11/20): Cole vs. Dijakovic In A Ladder Match, Several Stars From Raw And SmackDown, More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:26:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/traviswakeman/" target="_blank">Travis Wakeman</a></address>
      <p>It’s the last show before both <i>NXT TakeOver: WarGames</i> this Saturday night and <i>Survivor Series</i> this Sunday, so the action is fast and furious on this edition of NXT.</p>
      <p>The show starts with <i>Raw</i> Women’s champion Becky Lynch coming to the ring to address the crowd. The NXT crowd starts a chant in support of Shayna Baszler, and Becky challenges Baszler to come out. Instead, she gets Rhea Ripley.</p>
      <p>Ripley enters the ring and after she and Becky exchange words, they agree to a match.</p>

      <p>Baszler came out with both Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir and they went after both women.</p>
      <p>The Revival is shown arriving at the arena.</p>
      <p>Kona Reeves is coming to the ring for action but Ricochet comes out of nowhere and takes him out.</p>

      <p>Cesaro and Shinsuke Nakamura, representing <i>SmackDown</i>, came out during the match and provided the distraction that led to Riddle’s win. Roderick Strong came out and went after Nakamura and then Finn Balor came out and tangled with Riddle, but Riddle was able to get the best of that.</p>
      <p>It is announced that the Triple Threat Match between Pete Dunne, Damian Priest and Killian Dain at <i>TakeOver</i> will be a No.1 Contender’s match and the winner will challenge Adam Cole for the NXT Title at <i>Survivor Series</i>.</p>

      <p>After the match, the women from <i>SmackDown</i> come out and attack both Kai and Ray before the women from NXT and then <i>Monday Night Raw</i> join the fray. Nikki Cross uses a trash can lid to clear the ring and is left standing as the last woman inside the ring.</p>

      </p>
      <p>After the match, Raw, SmackDown and NXT come out and brawl again, something we have seen entirely too much of in the build to these big events.</p>
      <p>The show closes with Seth Rollins coming out and hitting Cole with a Superkick but that brings out Tommaso Ciampa who hits Cole with a running knee to the head outside the ring. He then gets in the ring for a face-off with Rollins and the two trade punches as the show closes.</p>
