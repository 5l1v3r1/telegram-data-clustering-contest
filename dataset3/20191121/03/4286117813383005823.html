      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Both Kollywood legends drop hints of a possible tie-up</li>
        <li>If need arises we will get together: Kamal Haasan</li>
        <li>Rajini makes similar statement; fans ecstatic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan. Superstar and Ulaganayagan. A friendship forged on the sets of Apoorva Raagangal (1975) has lasted four decades, and now, Kollywood's two biggest stars have hinted at a joint political venture.</p>
      <p>Kamal Hassan was the first to answer the question of a possible alliance. There is no miracle in our joining hands," he said on Tuesday at the Chennai airport. "We have been together for 44 years. <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/if-need-arises-will-join-hands-for-welfare-of-tamil-nadu-rajinikanth-kamal-haasan-hint-at-joining-hands-1620632-2019-11-19">If the need comes for us to get together</a> [in politics] then we will. Right now, work is important; talking about this is not. For the benefit of the people of Tamil Nadu, we can take this journey together."</p>
      <p>Within half an hour, Rajinikanth, too, had made a similar statement: "For the benefit of the people, if there is a situation to form an alliance with Kamal Haasan, we will definitely come together."</p>
      <p>These hints have made fans of both men extremely happy. Arunachalam, a member of Kamal Haasan's Makkal Needhi Maiam party said, "I am a fan of Rajini sir as well, and if Kamal sir and Rajini sir join hands then it is the best news that I have got in the 50 years of my life. Tamil Nadu will be a glorious state if these two join hands and come to power.</p>
      <p>PC Balasubramaniam, author of Rajini’s Punchtantra and Grand Brand Rajini, said: "Today’s audience in Tamil Nadu will be very excited even if they come together on the silver screen, and there are no two ways about it."</p>
      <p>"Political front also. Although they might have different ideologies, and different parties, they can come together and give a tough fight."</p>
      <p>"The two superstars have been friends for two decades and if they come together it will be huge for Tamil Nadu, as they are coming with the aim to bring a corruption-free Tamil Nadu," said Makkal Needhi Maiam vice-president R Mahendran.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'WE AREN'T BOTHERED'</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the two superstars’ fans and supporters expressed approval of the hinted alliance, political parties were quick to dismiss the impact of their union. Tamil Nadu's fisheries minister, D Jayakumar of the AIADMK, said, If at all they come together, we are not bothered. Our party is like an Everest. No one can touch us. The only worried party is the DMK. Our vote bank is strong; only the DMK will be affected."</p>
      <p>The BJP, an ally of the AIADMK, took a similar stand.</p>
      <p>Both Rajinikanth and Kamal Hassan are into totally different [ideologies]. Rajini says spiritual politics and Kamal says he is an atheist, and practically it is not possible. Even then if they want to join, well and good. What is wrong in that? There is nothing wrong. But can they do it?" asked BJP spokesperson Narayanan Thirupathy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'COMPULSION OF TIME'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Allegations that Rajini was close to the BJP, and speculation about the BJP's attempts to woo him were laid to rest after he recently said he could not be saffronised.</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth announced his political entry on December 31, 2017, and said he would form a party that would contest from all of Tamil Nadu's constituencies.</p>
      <p>"This is the compulsion of time," Rajini said back then. But the delay in forming a party has been criticised by other political outfits in the state; they call him a 'reel hero alone'.</p>
      <p>Now, with hints that the two superstars will join hands, there's a lot of excitement among their respective followers. Will this just be an episode or be a big development in Tamil Nadu politics? We'll have to wait and watch.</p>
