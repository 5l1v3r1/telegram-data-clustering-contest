      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - Susan Choi's novel "Trust Exercise," in which a high school romance is spun out into a web of memories and perspectives, has won the National Book Award for fiction.</p>
      <p>Sarah M. Broom's family memoir "The Yellow House" won in nonfiction and Martin W. Sandler's "1919 The Year That Changed America" for young people's literature. The winner for best translated book was Laszlo Krasznahorkai's "Baron Wenckheim's Homecoming," translated from Hungarian by Ottilie Mulzet. In poetry, the winner was Arthur Sze's "Sight Lines."</p>
      <p>Choi expressed gratitude not just for the award, but for the writing life, saying that writing and teaching showed her that the word was "its own reward." Her other books include the Pulitzer Prize finalist "American Woman" and the PEN/Faulkner finalist "A Person of Interest."</p>
      <p>The 70th annual National Book Awards were presented Wednesday night at a dinner benefit gala in downtown Manhattan. Honorary prizes were given to author Edmund White and to the head of the American Booksellers Association, Oren J. Teicher.</p>
