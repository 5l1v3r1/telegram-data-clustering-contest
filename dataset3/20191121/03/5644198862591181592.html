      <p>MADRID: Canada's decision to forfeit their doubles rubber in Tuesday's Group F clash against the U.S. at the revamped Davis Cup Finals has come under fire from rival teams.</p>
      <p>Victories in both singles rubbers had given Canada a 2-0 lead to seal a first ever Davis Cup win over their neighbours in 16 attempts and guarantee them top spot in the group.</p>

      <p>They then opted to concede the doubles rubber, giving the U.S. a 6-0 6-0 victory.</p>
      <p>"Three of the Canadian players were passed unfit to the play the doubles," the organisers the ITF said at the time.</p>
      <p>The U.S. face Italy later on Wednesday at La Caja Magica with the winner of the tie finishing runner-up.</p>
      <p>With the two best runners-up in the six groups joining the group winners in the quarter-finals, the U.S. could benefit from the fact that were effectively handed two gift 6-0 sets, should they beat Italy and finish second behind Canada.</p>
      <p>"I personally don't like that. I mean, that shouldn't be allowed, to be honest," Serbia's Novak Djokovic told reporters after his side's 3-0 win over Japan in Group A on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"I understand that Canada is through already, they won both of their ties. Maybe some of the players like Felix (Auger-Aliassime), I think he's injured, and they wanted to rest their players for the quarter-finals and onwards.</p>
      <p>"But I just feel it's not fair the U.S. gets 6-0 6-0. That 6-0 6-0 might make a big difference in the calculations for the second-best teams in the group. I think everyone should be obliged to come out and play, at least play."</p>
      <p>Britain's Andy Murray agreed.</p>
      <p>"I don't think that's good. I was saying I felt like one of the positive things to the way the group stages work is that all of the matches are live, there isn't any dead rubbers.</p>
      <p>"So where Canada may have felt that that was a dead rubber in theory for them because they were already through, that could have implications to all of the teams potentially that might finish in second place.</p>
      <p>"Also they would have had two days off as well after that so I think they should have played the tie."</p>
      <p>The best second-placed nations will be decided first on matches won, then individual rubbers, then sets and then games.</p>
