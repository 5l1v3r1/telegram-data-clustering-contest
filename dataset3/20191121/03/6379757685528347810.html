      <p>He made the statement yesterday when addressing party elders at Kizimkazi-Mkunguni school in South Unguja. He argued that both, serving leaders and retired party officials have responsibilities to build the party through their councils and party wings.</p>
      <p>Dr Shein who is CCM’s Vice Chairman (Zanzibar) challenged elders to talk to youth on various party issues as well as informing them on how to care for the elders. He said the government recognises and values the efforts by elders which led into the independency of Tanganyika and Zanzibar through ASP and TANU.</p>
      <p>“We should value the elders as well as their opinions because they are the ones who fought for our independency,” he said adding that the elders are also recognised by the ruling party’s manifesto and country’s constitution.</p>
      <p>CCM Secretary General (Zanzibar), Abdalla Juma Mabodi called upon other party leaders to regularly meet with the elders. He commended President Shein for ensuring regular meetings with party elders.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the elders applauded President Shein for successful implementation of CCM election manifesto (2015-2020) as well as the promises he made during 2015 election campaigns. They also commended the president for introducing a 20,000/- monthly pension to elders, whereas currently there are 1,348 elders benefiting with the new scheme that started in 2016 with 1,421 elders.</p>
      <p>They were concerned that President Shein has been in the fore front to ensure improved social services especially availability of clean and safe water in South Unguja district and Makunduchi area. The elders noted that implementation of the 1.8bn/- water project at Michamvi and Mtende Shehias have started with the contractor laying water distribution pipes.</p>
      <p>On health sector, the elders said the government has improved provision of health services in South Unguja district and installed modern medical equipment at hospitals and health centers. They said most of the residents now get medical services at their localities while they were previously forced to seek such services at the Mnazi Mmoja referral hospital.</p>
      <p>CCM chairman in South Unguja district, Abdulaziz Hamad Ibrahim said during President Shein’s tenure, the government has been able to increase its revenue collection, leading to improved social services.</p>
