      <p>The <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/rupee">rupee</a> on Thursday opened 3 paise down at 71.84 against the US <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/dollar-industries-ltd/stocks/companyid-65885.cms">dollar</a> amid rising crude oil prices and fresh concerns over US-China trade tensions that supported demand for the safe-haven greenback.</p>
      <p>Oil prices surged more than 2 per cent on Wednesday after a better-than-expected US crude inventories report and as Russia said it would continue its cooperation with <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Opec">Opec</a> to keep the global oil market balanced. However, the commodity was trading around 0.20 per cent down in the morning trade on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The local currency declined 10 paise to close at 71.81 against the American currency on Wednesday, in line with weak Asian currencies.</p>
      <p>In the last couple of sessions, rupee consolidated in a narrow range despite gains in domestic and global equities following optimism related to trade talks between US and China. But yesterday, US equities came under pressure following reports that ‘Phase One’ deal between the two major economies could slide in to next year. Reports suggested that China is pushing for more extensive tariff rollbacks and the Trump administration counters with heightened demands of its own.</p>
      <p>“Dollar strengthened against its major crosses also after FOMC minutes showed that Fed officials won’t need to cut interest rates again unless economic conditions change significantly. Today, USDINR pair is expected to quote in the range of 71.70 and 72.20,” <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/motilal-oswal-financial-services-ltd/stocks/companyid-18715.cms">Motilal Oswal Financial Services</a> said.</p>
      <p>Euro and Pound in the last few sessions have been trading positive ahead of the important preliminary manufacturing and services PMI number that will be released in tomorrow’s session. Expectation is that both the economies could witness a bit of a rebound and that could give major crosses support at lower levels.</p>
      <p>Today, from the Euro zone, ECB minutes will be in focus and expectation is that the central bank will continue to maintain a dovish stance and could extend gains for the currency.</p>
