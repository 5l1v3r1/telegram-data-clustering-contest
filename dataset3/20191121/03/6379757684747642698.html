      <p>Speaking with the drivers here yesterday during the launch of DRINKiQ Campaign to promote responsible drinking when driving, the SBL corporate relations director John Wanyancha explained that, the DrinkiQ campaign aims at promoting road safety by promoting responsible drinking and not drinking while driving especially during the seasons when frequent accidents are reported to occur, sometimes resulting in deaths and morbidity to many drivers, passengers and other road users.</p>
      <p>“In realisation of the fact that drivers are among the consumers of our beer products and other alcohol beverages, SBL initiated this campaign countrywide to discuss with our customers on responsible drinking and driving,” he explained.<br/>Wanyancha further explained that they have already run such campaigns in Dar-es-salaam, Arusha, Mwanza, Morogoro, Tanga, and Moshi regions.</p>
      <p>“Through this campaign we have reached more than 10,000 people directly, while many others were reached through various media including social media....” Wanyancha further explained.</p>
      <p>For her part, the Kilimanjaro Regional Traffic Officer (RTO), Superintendent of Police (SP) Zauda Mohammed said the awareness by SBL entailed modern driving skills that require a driver to drive with a sober mind instead of drink and drive.</p>
      <p>She further explained that, most of the roads accidents are caused by reckless drivers who don’t abide with road regulations whereby records show that 80 per cent of accidents are caused by reckless drivers, 12 per cent by mechanical problems of the vehicles, 6 per cent by climate change, while only 2 per cent of are caused by bad infrastructures.</p>
      <p>“My appeal to all drivers and other road users is to abide by all road regulations to avoid unnecessary road accidents,” the Kilimanjaro traffic boss insisted.</p>
      <p>According to the RTO, people don’t need to be afraid of police officers, instead they should work together as a team to avoid unnecessary road accidents and crimes for sustainable safety of the public.</p>
