      <h1>Nokia 9 PureView drops to super-low price of $380 ($320 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:18:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/corbin-davenport/" target="_blank">Corbin Davenport</a></address>
      <p>The Nokia 9 PureView has plummeted in price since it was released earlier this year, turning it into something more competitive with devices from OnePlus. Now you can get the PureView for just $379.99 from B&amp;H Photo, a discount of $380 from the original price.</p>
      <p>The Nokia 9 PureView has a Snapdragon 845 processor, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage, a 3320mAh battery, a 6-inch 1080p OLED screen, and stock Android 9 Pie. The camera array on the back is the highlight feature, as the mix of 12MP RGB sensors, 12MP monochrome sensors, flashes, and time-of-flight sensors can result in some great pictures. Like most of HMD Global's phones, the PureView only works on GSM networks like AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, and not Verizon or Sprint.</p>

      <p>We <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/03/18/the-nokia-9-pureview-is-a-good-phone-ruined-by-serious-problems/">reviewed the PureView</a> when it was released in March, and found that while the hardware and software were mostly excellent, the camera suffered from sluggish processing and the in-screen fingerprint sensor was terrible. HMD Global has <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/04/20/nokia-9-pureview-update-addresses-fingerprint-scanner-performance/">improved both aspects with updates</a>, and an Android 10 upgrade should arrive <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/30/nokia-reveals-its-android-10-update-plans/">before the end of the year</a>.</p>
