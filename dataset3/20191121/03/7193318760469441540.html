    <meta property="og:description" content="Ka-pow! Comic book legend Frank Miller — who penned “The Dark Knight Returns” and “Sin City” — socked his ex-wife with a lawsuit Monday for allegedly swiping valuable rough sketches of his work and trying to sell them under the table. Lynn Varley, an award-winning comic book colorist who collaborated with Miller on many of his early tomes, is allegedly hiding preliminary sketches she squirreled away before the couple’s divorce, Miller claims in his Manhattan Supreme Court lawsuit. Varley filed for divorce in 2006, after 20 years of marriage. In 2011, while the duo was still married, they cut a deal to divvy up illustrations and artwork they owned, according to the court documents."/>
