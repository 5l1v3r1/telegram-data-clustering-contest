      </p>
      <p>The dividend of the common stock has been on the rise for the past several years, from $0.50 in 2014 to $0.82 in 2018. Also, for 2019, the common stock is expected to have paid Ð° $1.20 yearly dividend. With a market price of $44.50, the current yield of CIT is at 2.70%. As an absolute value, this means it pays $113.70 million in dividends yearly. For comparison, the yearly dividend expenses for all outstanding preferred stocks (with the newly issued Series B Preferred Stock) of the company is around $30 million.</p>
      <p>In addition, with a market capitalization of around $4.26 billion, CIT is one of the relatively large companies in the "Credit Services" sector (according to Finviz).</p>

      </p>
      <p>As of Q3 2019, CIT had a total debt of $6.88 billion ranking senior to the newly issued preferred stock. The new Series B preferred stock rank is junior to all outstanding debt and equal to the other preferred shares of the company, the Series A Preferred Stock which total $335 million.</p>

          <b>The Ratios Which We Should Care About</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Our purpose today is not to make an investment decision regarding the common stock of CIT but to find out if its new preferred stock has the need quality to be part of our portfolio. Here is the moment where I want to remind you of two important aspects of the preferred stocks compared to the common stocks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preferred shareholders have priority over a company's income, meaning they are paid dividends before common shareholders.</li>
        <li>Common stockholders are last in line when it comes to company assets, which means they will be paid out after creditors, bondholders, and preferred shareholders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Based on our research and experience, these are the most important metrics we use when comparing preferred stocks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Market Cap/(Long-term debt + Preferreds)</b>. This is our main criteria when determining credit risk. <b>The bigger the ratio, the safer the preferred.</b> Based on the latest annual report and taking into consideration the latest preferred issue, we have a ratio of 4,260/(6,880 + 525) = <b>0.62</b>, which is not the best coverage we can hope for, as the company is quite more leveraged.</li>
        <li><b>Earnings/(Debt and Preferred Payments).</b> This is also a quite easy-to-understand approach. One can use EBITDA instead of earnings, but we prefer to have our buffer in what is left to the common stockholder. The higher this ratio, the better. The ratio with the TTM results is 470/(310 + 30) = <b>1.30</b>, which looks better from the previous, and despite the high leverage, the cost of that leverage is relatively low.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>The CIT Group Family</b>
      </p>
      <p>Except for one fixed-to-floating preferred stock, <b>CIT Group Inc. 5.80% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A</b>, that is on listed on any National exchange, there are 13 corporate bonds issued by the company:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        <i>Source: FINRA</i>
      </p>
      <p>For the purpose of this comparison, I choose the 2025 bond, CIT4608106, that has the closest maturity to the call date of the newly issued preferred stock. CIT4608106, as it is the FINRA ticker, matures three months later than CIT-B becomes callable and has a Yield-to-Maturity of 3.21%. This should be compared to the 4.92% Yield-to-Call of CIT-B, but when making that comparison, do remember that CIT-B's YTC is the maximum you could realize if you hold the preferred stock until 2024. That translates into a yield spread of 1.70% between the two securities.</p>
      <p>Some more information about the bond can be found in the chart below.</p>

          <b>Addition to the </b>
          <i>iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>With the current market capitalization of the new issue of around $200 million, the new IPO is a possible addition to the <i>ICE Exchange-Listed Preferred &amp; Hybrid Securities Index </i>during some of the next rebalancings. It will also be included in the holdings of the main benchmark, the iShares U.S. Preferred Stock ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFF">PFF</a>), which is the ETF that seeks to track the investment results of this index, and which is important to us due to its influence on the behavior of all fixed-income securities. I'll just remind you about the last year's summer rally in the fixed-income borne from the redemption of the two "giants" HSEA and HSEB and the released cash of over $600 million used from PFF to buy more of the rest of its holdings.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <b>Conclusion</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>As fixed-income traders, we follow each preferred stock or baby bond which is listed on the stock exchange. As such, <b>CIT-B </b>is no exception, and the homework we always do we share it with the public. It is not necessary for the IPO to be an arbitrage and a bargain, but in many cases, the new security happens to be better than the ones already trading on the market.</p>
      <p>The company's ratios are satisfying but definitely cannot be defined as exceptional. CIT has quite more debt + preferred stocks than equity (market capitalization), despite the fact that the net income for the TTM is enough to cover all the bondholders and preferred stockholders' payments.</p>
      <p>As for the yields, there aren't any listed securities in the CIT Group's capital structure. There are one more fixed-to-floating preferred stock and a dozen corporate bonds that can be checked in FINRA. Unfortunately, not all brokers provide the ability to trade these instruments, so we use them mainly for informational purposes. Although, despite the small number of preferred stocks in the sector, CIT-B has one of the highest Yield-to-Worst with its Yield-to-Call of 4.92%. Along with CIT-B, there are a few other issues with a Yield-to-Worst close to the 5%, AGM-D, COF-I, and SYF-A. SYF-A is another recently issued preferred stock that is still trading on the Grey market, under the temporary ticker symbol SNFI. It is currently trading at a price of $25.28 that translates into a Yield-to-Worst of 5.65% and a similar call date as CIT-B. The difference between the two, however, is that SYF has a lot better financials than CIT, paying a lot more dividends on its common stock than its preferred stock, which is the only issued by the company. Generally, I would prefer SYF-A - getting the highest yield in the sector, with much less credit risk - than CIT-B, which has already reached a premium of 3%.</p>
