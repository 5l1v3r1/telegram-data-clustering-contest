      <h1>Lisa Vanderpump And Bravo TV Working Together On A New Project</h1>

      <p>According to a report from PageSix.com, Lisa Vanderpump isn’t averse to appearing on the Bravo TV network once again, but it depends on whether or not they choose to have her on. As fans of the reality star know, the 59-year-old left the set of <i>The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills</i> following the ending of the ninth season.</p>
      <p>However, according to new reports, there may be a spin-off around her dog rescue company, Vanderpump Dogs. During BravoCon, Vanderpump teased to Page Six about the production, stating that she would love to say she was getting a show, but people would have to wait and see what happens.</p>
      <p>Vanderpump claimed she thought it was a great idea, however, whether or not it went on air yet would remain to be seen. “But I’m not allowed to say anything at all,” the reality star remarked. Back in March of this year, Page Six reported that Lisa was working on a brand new project revolving around the company.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, her decision to create the dog center show was not loved by all, including some of the other cast and crew members, for instance, Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp, Lisa Rinna, and Erika Girardi.</p>

      <p>Fans of the series will remember there was an issue with the way that Dorit Kemsley dealt with one of the dogs. She reportedly gave it to a shelter after she got it from Vanderpump’s dog center.</p>
      <p>While she might have a new show, Vanderpump has another spin-off called <i>Vanderpump Rules</i>, revolving around her restaurant, SUR, in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Lisa doesn’t appear in it that often, however. The show started in 2013. Earlier this week, People Magazine reported that Kyle Richards wasn’t pleased with the fact Lisa Vanderpump was purportedly avoiding other co-stars on the show following her exit.</p>
      <p>This weekend, at the aforementioned BravoCon, Vanderpump responded to some of the comments from Richards, who stated that Kyle would always have something negative to say about her. “She would always sling something at me,” the reality star remarked.</p>
