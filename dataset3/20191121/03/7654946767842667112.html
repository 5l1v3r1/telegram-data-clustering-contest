      <h1>Kyrie Irving-less Nets use balanced attack to top Hornets</h1>

      <p>With the Nets offense cratering since the loss of Kyrie Irving, they’ve needed somebody — anybody — to step up and help Spencer Dinwiddie.</p>
      <p>They finally got that in a 101-91 win over the Hornets before a modest crowd of 14,011 at Barclays Center.</p>
      <p>The Nets (6-8) defended tooth-and-nail against the Hornets, allowing just 37 percent shooting and snatching 53 rebounds. And with their three best players — Irving, Kevin Durant and Caris LeVert — all out, they’re going to need that. And they’re going to need more of the rare offensive balance they got Wednesday night, as well.</p>
      <p>“It can be anybody,” coach Kenny Atkinson said before the game. “Spencer’s done an admirable job since Kyrie’s been out. It’s hard to ask much more of him. And he’s doing it on the defensive end, so we need to support him in general.</p>
      <p>“It could be anybody. Taurean [Prince is] more than capable, Joe [Harris is] s more than capable. He definitely needs some support right now.”</p>
      <p>Dinwiddie (20 points, eight assists, four rebounds) set the tone as Irving sat a third straight with a shoulder impingement. But with Atkinson begging for somebody else to step up offensively, the heretofore-struggling Prince did just that, along with their two-headed center platoon of Jarrett Allen and DeAndre Jordan.</p>

      <p>Prince had 20 points and eight rebounds. And when the Nets saw an 11-point cushion near the end of the third quarter shrivel to just 86-83 with 5:37 left in the fourth, he drilled a clutch 3-pointer to stanch the bleeding.</p>
      <p>Allen and Jordan were nightmares for Charlotte on rolls and lobs, respectively. Allen had season-highs of 22 points and 17 rebounds, and Jordan came off the bench with 14 points and seven boards.</p>
      <p>“It’s huge it gives us so momentum, for the home stretch,” Allen said in an on-court interview after the win. “The crowd was into it, the bench was into it, we were all into it. … It’s next man up. We showed that.”</p>
      <p>The Nets have been noncommittal about a recovery time for Irving. But in his absence, they’ve needed Harris to shoot more and Prince to shoot better.</p>
      <p>After averaging 15.5 points in his first six games as a Net on 44.4 percent shooting from deep, Prince had cooled off to just 10 points on 32.5 percent shooting from deep in his previous seven games coming into Wednesday.</p>
      <p>But against Charlotte he hit four of nine from behind the arc, including that clutch dagger with 5 ½ minutes left to stem the tide.</p>
      <p>“He’s struggled shooting the ball a little bit,” Atkinson had said. “We still love him. He’s so important to how we’re playing. When we play well he usually plays well. That four position I do think he’s adapting a little bit to that. He’s kind of played the three a lot of his career. This is a bit of a shift for him.</p>
      <p>“I’ll put him in the bucket [with] our team, just consistency. The average to below average teams are inconsistent. The really good teams are consistent. And that’s players, too, right? The great players are just more consistent. They can do it over and over. That’s what we’re really searching for right now.”</p>
      <p>The Nets were locked in a 28-all tie after a Miles Bridges pull-up two minutes into the second quarter. But they tightened the screws defensively and held Charlotte scoreless for almost the next four minutes.</p>
      <p>The Nets harassed the Hornets into five straight misses and four turnovers, and Prince drilled a 3-pointer to put them ahead 39-30.</p>
      <p>By the time Terry Rozier (team-high 18 points) broke the run midway through the second quarter, the Nets had seized momentum.</p>
      <p>Clinging to a five-point edge in the third, Allen scored five straight points to double that cushion. He made one of two at the line, then had back-to-back dunks to give the Nets a 70-60 lead.</p>
      <p>Jordan’s free throws padded it to 82-71 with 1:37 left in the third. The Nets saw Charlotte (6-9) close to within three, but no closer, and they closed it out for a much-needed shorthanded win.</p>
