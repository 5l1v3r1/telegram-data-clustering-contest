      <h1>Bill Belichick Addresses The Viral Story Jerry Jones Told About Him</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:37:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Jerry Jones told a pretty great story about Bill Belichick in anticipation of Sunday afternoon’s game between his Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys owner recalled Belichick pitching himself for a coaching job after he was fired by the Cleveland Browns back in 1996. Jones had ran into Belichick at a ski resort, where the pitch was made.</p>
      <p>“Bill Belichick said, ‘I can coach. If you ever get an opportunity, don’t forget about me,’” Jones said on 105.3 The Fan on Tuesday. “I’ve thought about that many times. You never know where you can find a great coach. You can find them in a ski checkout line sometimes.”</p>
      <p>Belichick ended up landing an assistant coach job in New England later that year. He became the team’s head coach in 2000 and has won six Super Bowls. The Cowboys have had four head coaches since Belichick was hired by the Patriots.</p>
      <p>New England’s head coach addressed Jones’ story today.</p>
      <p>“Yeah, I was out in Snowmass. I was out there with the family, and Jerry, he’s got on a big white jacket with a blue star, coming off a couple Super Bowl victories out there. But yeah, Jerry and the Jones’ have always been great to me,” he said.</p>

      <p>Belichick didn’t confirm asking Jones for a job, though he admitted his memory isn’t the best. What could have been…</p>
