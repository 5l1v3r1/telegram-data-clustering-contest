      <h1>Luka Doncic dismantles Warriors in only three quarters with another dazzling triple-double</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:01:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bernstein</a></address>
      <p>Luka Doncic hascaptured the attention of the NBA-watching universe — not just in a check-the-numbers kind of way, but a must-watch-his-games respect.</p>
      <p>One game after the Mavericks guard recordeda 40-point triple-double against the Spurs, he picked apart the depleted Warriors on Wednesday night with a 35-point, 11-assist and 10-reboundperformance. The 20-year-oldscored 22 points in the first quarter alone — his career high for a single period.</p>
      <p>Doncic might not be better than LeBron or Giannis at this point, though that debate will probably be had soon; however, there's a case to be made that he's the more novel draw.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Doncic won Rookie of the Year honors last season, but he has leveled up in 2019, improving his shooting efficiency, playmaking ability and work on the boards.</p>
      <p>Sure, his opponent Wednesday resembed a G-League unit. Golden State is without Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, D'Angelo Russell and Draymond Green, but given the context of the run Doncic has been on, theperformance was still special.</p>
      <p>His early scoring barrage showed the mix of go-to moves he has at his disposal. In addition toa couple of his patented step-back 3s from the left wing, he demonstrated his explosiveness going to the rim and strong decision-making in transition.</p>

      <p>If the Mavericks weren't up 40 in the third quarter (they wound up winning 142-94), Doncic would have had an opportunity to play more than 25minutes (he averages 35 per game).</p>
      <p>He still managed to check off some historicboxes. Here are some of the most notable figures from one of the best games of his early career:</p>
