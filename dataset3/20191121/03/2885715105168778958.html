      <h1>Panchkula: Over-occupancy forces early discharge of patients at Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre</h1>
      <h2>In the month of October alone, the occupancy at the centre was 152 per cent.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:13:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/chahat-rana/" target="_blank">Chahat Rana</a></address>
      <p>Over-occupancy at the Nutrition Rehabilitation Centre (<a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/">NRC</a>) of the Civil Hospital in Panchkula has compelled the medical staff there to discharge patients before the mandated six weeks rehabilitation. In the month of October alone, the occupancy at the centre was 152 per cent.</p>
      <p>Under the National Health Mission, 1,151 such NRCs have been established across the country to treat Severe Acute Malnutrition and related health complications in children under the age of five. These children are either referred to the centre by other departments, where children our admitted for illnesses such as pneumonia or jaundice, or sent through frontline medical aid and child support agents such as Aanganwadi workers or ASHA workers.</p>
      <p>“We have six beds at our centre, but we always have at least ten children admitted at a given period of time. Of course we make space for these children and provide them beds in the adjacent, general pediatrics wards and we give them the same holistic treatment and nutrition that we provide the others,” says Dr <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rohit-sharma/">Rohit Sharma</a>, a pediatrician at the Civil Hospital and the nodal officer appointed to run the NRC. However, despite his best efforts, the children admitted to the centre are not given treatment for the mandated time period of six weeks. “We do follow the guideline, which asks us to make sure that the child’s weight has increased by 15 per cent before discharging them. However, when some severely malnourished children are admitted and we have to make space, we are forced to discharge those who have partially recovered,” says Sharma.</p>
      <p>“Some of the parents are also in a rush to take the children back with themselves as they say, they cannot afford to miss out on their daily wages to be present at the centre with their children,” says Dr Minki Singla, a nutrition counsellor at the centre. Singla’s job is to counsel the parents on how to maintain their children’s weight at a healthy level to ensure that they do not suffer with severe malnourishment again.</p>
      <p>Further, the centre is supposed to provide Rs 100 to the family of the children for each day that the child is admitted, as an incentive to the families who would otherwise lose their daily wages by missing work to attend to their child. “They should increase this incentive to at least half their minimum wage, otherwise they miss out on a lot of money,” says Sharma.</p>
      <p>“I have asked my husband to go to work and leave me here alone because at least one of us should earn. Otherwise, who will pay our rent, or pay for our ration?” says Manju, a young mother of a four-year-old Ankit, who is suffering from Pneumonia as well as malnutrition and was admitted to the centre three days ago. “Lets see how soon they can discharge my child so that I can start working again,” adds Manju.</p>
