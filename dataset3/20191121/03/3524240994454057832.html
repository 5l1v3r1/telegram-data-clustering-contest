      <p><b>Super Eagles</b> coach, Gernot Rohr, has put on hold the possibility of inviting Queens Park Rangers’ star, Eberechi Eze, to the national team after he stated that he won’t invite new players for the 2022 World Cup qualifiers in March.</p>
      <p>Rohr, who was at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Lagos for the match-day four game between MFM and Warri Wolves in the Nigeria Professional Football League on Wednesday, said bringing in new players might disrupt his plans for the World Cup qualifiers next year.</p>
      <p>“There are no more friendlies, so there is no more time to invite new players we don’t know,” Rohr told reporters.</p>
      <p>“We need harmony in the team and if you are bringing in new players to do better for the team than they are doing now, which one do you want to push out of the team?</p>
      <p>“Those players must be really better than what we have already.”</p>
      <p>This could mean Eze, who has been sought after by the Nigeria Football Federation, might not be getting any call up soon.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old added that he is thrilled with the current competition in the team.</p>
      <p>“I hope everybody will be fit, we miss some players for the (AFCON) qualifiers like Oghenekaro Etebo, Bryan Idowu, who could not come. But now there is a very good competition for starting positions, which is very good for the level of the team.</p>
      <p>“It is good to have competition and to have such good players, now we have four very good central defenders but I have to choose two or play three like we did in the second half in Lesotho.”</p>
