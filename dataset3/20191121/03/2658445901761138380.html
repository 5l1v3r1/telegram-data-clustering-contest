      <p>The Nigeria Institute of Quantity Surveyors &amp; Valuers (NIQS) said it is partnering the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission (ICPC) and the Presidency to track constituency projects wherever they are located across the nation.</p>
      <p>NIQS  President, Femi Onashile said as cost economists in the construction sector they see it as their contribution to the growth of the economy to track the budgets approved for each project.  He spoke at a parley announcing the annual Biennial conference  of the institute in Lagos.</p>
      <p>He explained that costing for politicians are arbitrary and not usually based on scientific proof and that the institute is poised towards bringing sanity to contract awards and execution in the nation.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are independent assessors and not politicians with independent professional opinion. Our part is to go to site and cost the projects said to have been executed for a particular amount. Based on the materials used, size and height of the said project we give the appropriate costing.”</p>
      <p>He sought the patronage of indigenous professionals on projects to build capacity. Onashile regretted that in most construction projects foreign firms are preferred to local professionals not for lack of proficiency or skill of the locals but by other extraneous reasons which is inimical to the growth of indigenous skill and competencies but also the economy.</p>
      <p>He argued on the need to have a law that would compel developers to engage indigenous professionals in the sector, noting that it is the only way they can grow and be competitive. he advised his colleagues to form mega firms with specialization to be able to compete for bigger jobs like their foreign counterpart.</p>
      <p>The NIQS president further canvassed for reforms in the construction sector regretting that the nation is still operating a contract form of 1963. He stated that before now contract disagreements are only solved through arbitration or litigation while other developed climes have gone beyond that with processes such as arbitration and alternative dispute resolution.</p>
      <p>He explained that reforms will also guarantee security of payment.</p>
      <p>“There is flagrant abuse of contractual agreement as a result of not only noticeable lapses in our laws but also the fact that the regular courts are not actually primed to deal with construction disputes. Judges are not trained in the technicalities involved in construction and may sometimes not be enthusiastic or patient enough to arbitrate in such matters. It is therefore our considered opinion that government consider the establishment of dedicated construction courts”.</p>
      <p>On why he is calling for reforms, he said reforms in the sector have the capacity to grow the economy, create ample opportunity for professionals to develop themselves, impact more on the citizens as a result of modern infrastructure and modern life style”.</p>
