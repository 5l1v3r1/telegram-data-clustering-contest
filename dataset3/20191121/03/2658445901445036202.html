      <p>Super Eagles dazzling forward, Samuel Chukwueze has said that he hopes to replicate his international form for Villarreal when they face Celta Vigo later this weekend, AOIFootball.com reports.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old impressed in Nigeria’s two openings AFCON 2021 qualifiers and found the net in their 4-2 win over Lesotho and now wants to return to Spain with such high spirit.</p>
      <p>“It was a perfect outing for me, massive wins in both games and to even get a goal made it more special but overall I am glad we began the AFCON qualifiers with a perfect record.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s time to switch attention back to club football. Hopefully, I can replicate the same form for Villarreal in the next game,” Chukwueze said.</p>
      <p>Despite falling down the pecking order of late at Estadio de la Ceramica, the 20-year-old revealed that he has been training very well and will always try to do his best whenever he is given the chance to lead the line for the Yellow Submarines.</p>
