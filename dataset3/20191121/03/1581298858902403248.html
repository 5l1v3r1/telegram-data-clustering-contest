      </p>
      <p>The team won Activ's Galaxy Award in Perth on Saturday, for being the team that best demonstrated Activ's values.</p>
      <p>These values include leading with courage, learning and growing and sharing a passion for people.</p>
      <p>Activ chief executive officer Danielle Newport said the Esperance 'kitchen rules-style' initiative originated from one customer expressing an interest in learning how to cook.</p>
      <p>Ms Newport said the cooking competition was then created between a male customer team, a female customer team and a staff team.</p>
      <p>The teams competed against each other at a series of 'instant restaurants' earlier in 2019, where community members judged the meals.</p>
      <p>The judges included members of <i>The Express</i>, the council, a local chef and local businesses.</p>
      <p>The kitchen contest was a great opportunity for customers to enhance their daily life skills in a way that was both fun and inclusive.</p>
