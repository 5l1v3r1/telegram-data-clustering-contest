      <h1>Sydney faces tougher water restrictions as NSW grapples with drought</h1>

        <i>Under the level-two water restrictions, people will need to use a bucket or watering can to water gardens at approved times</i>
      </p>
      <p>Parts of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales">New South Wales</a> will face tougher water restrictions in an attempt to stem falling dam levels as the state grapples with drought.</p>
      <p>The premier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gladys-berejiklian">Gladys Berejiklian</a>, and the water minister, Melinda Pavey, on Thursday announced Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the Illawarra would be subject to level-two water restrictions from 10 December.</p>
      <p>They are usually enforced when Greater Sydney’s dam levels fall to 40% but are being brought forward. The total storage is currently at 46%.</p>
      <p>“We’re experiencing one of the most severe droughts on record and we expect introducing level-two restrictions to save 78.5 gigalitres of water per year,” Berejiklian said.</p>
      <p>“The amount of water we’re losing every month is accelerating faster than it’s been before … we’re doing this because we want to ensure we have water supply without any concerns.</p>
      <p>Under the restrictions, people will need to use a bucket or watering can to water gardens between approved times.</p>
      <p>Cars can only be washed with a bucket or taken to a commercial car wash and the topping up of pools and spas will be limited to 15 minutes a day with a trigger nozzle.</p>
      <p>“Basically these restrictions mean you can’t use a hose and that is going to be a challenge for some people, especially our older population, and we’re very aware of that,” Pavey told reporters.</p>
      <p>Fines of $220 apply for residential breaches while businesses face a potential $550 penalty.</p>
      <p>Labor supports bringing the restrictions forward but also wants the coalition to expand the capacity of Sydney’s desalination plant which returned to operation in January.</p>
      <p>“Sydneysiders are heeding the warnings and are doing their bit to save water but it is clear that it is not going to be enough,” opposition water spokesman Clayton Barr said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The premier either has to commit to an expansion of the current facility today or investigate a new facility in the state.”</p>
      <p>Berejiklian said they were considering expanding the plant.</p>
      <p>The Liberal leader said introducing level 2 restrictions in December would “prolong” the period before level 3 restrictions had to be considered.</p>
      <p>Pavey said <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sydney">Sydney</a> water usage had dropped from about 200 litres per person per day before level 1 restrictions were introduced in June to about 183 litres per person per day in October.</p>
