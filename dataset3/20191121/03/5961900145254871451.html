      <h1>GET THE FANCY GLASSES: A $7 Bottle Of Aldi Plonk Just Won Gold At An Aussie Wine Comp</h1>

      <p>Nothing enthuses me more than the <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/">Aldi</a> wine section. Except maybe the Aldi cheese section – the other night my friend stole her housemate’s cheese and it turned out to be a) the best goddamn blue I’ve had in my life and b) from Aldi. I approved of the stealing since she lives with an ex of mine and it was probably his.</p>
      <p>Aldi are known for scoring top gongs for wines that cost less than your school lunch order, and yep – it’s bloody happened again.</p>
      <p>At the Sydney International Wine Competition, their<a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/liquor/champagne-sparkling/champagne-sparkling-detail/ps/p/veuve-monsigny-brut-champagne-nv/"> Veuve Monsigny Brut Champagne</a> made the Top 100. It’s $21.99.</p>

      <p>Their <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/liquor/wine/wine-detail/ps/p/one-road-cabernet-merlot/">One Road Goulburn &amp; King Valley Cabernet Merlot</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/liquor/wine/wine-detail/ps/p/ac-byrne-co-margaret-river-cabernet-merlot/">A.C. Byrne &amp; Co Margaret River Cabernet Merlot 2018</a>, $6.99 and $9.99 respectively, also scored Blue Gold gongs in the same comp.</p>

      <p>The Aldi <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/liquor/wine/wine-detail/ps/p/south-point-estate-ros-1/">South Point Estate Rose</a> also took out the People’s Picks Award.</p>

      <p>But the absolute clanger is the <a href="https://www.aldi.com.au/en/groceries/liquor/wine/wine-detail/ps/p/one-road-shiraz/">One Road Shiraz</a>, which picked up GOLD – the top spot – in an entire Shiraz competition, The Great Shiraz Challenge.</p>
      <p>All these wines are available at Aldi right now, so why don’t you do what I’m absolutely doing tonight – go buy 3 bottles and a shit-tonne of cheese, then eat it all yourself while crying in a corner of a highly air-conditioned room. Vibes or what.</p>
