        <b>The European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) reported that a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck Laos on Thursday, with the epicenter registered some 219 kilometers northwest of Vientiane at an approximate depth of 10 kilometers.</b>

      <p>There has been no information on damage or casualties. <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911201077359890-second-in-a-day-54-magnitude-earthquake-strikes-off-the-coast-of-mexicos-chiapas---usgs/">Eyewitnesses said</a>, cited by EMSC, that the tremor was felt over 100 kilometers away from the epicenter.</p>
      <blockquote>The EMSC later downgraded the quake's magnitude to 5.7. The EMSC also said that another quake with a recorded magnitude of 6.1 hit Thailand moments after the tremor jolted neighboring Laos.</blockquote>

      <p>Laos and Thailand are situated in a seismically active part of the planet where the Indo-Australian Plate runs up against the Eurasian Plate.</p>
      <p>In March 2011, dozens of people were reportedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911191077348599-four-people-injured-as-magnitude-59-earthquake-hits-philippines---reports/">killed in an earthquake</a> in Myanmar that hit the nation's border region with Thailand and Laos.</p>
