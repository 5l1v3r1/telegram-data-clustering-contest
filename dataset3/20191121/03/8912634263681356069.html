      <p>DAKHLA, Western Sahara: In the Oued Eddahab desert in Western Sahara, Habiboullah Dlimi raises dairy and racing camels just like his ancestors used to — but with a little help from modern technology.<br/>His animals roam free in the desert and are milked as camels always have been, by hand, at dawn and dusk.<br/>When camels “feed on wild plants and walk all day, the milk is much better,” said the 59-year-old herder, rhapsodizing about the benefits of the nutrient-rich drink, known as the “source of life” for nomads.<br/>But Dlimi no longer lives with his flock.<br/>He lives in town with his family. His camels are watched over by hired herders and Dlimi follows GPS coordinates across the desert in a 4X4 vehicle to reach them.<br/>He is reticent when asked about the size of his herd. “That would bring bad luck,” he said.<br/>He prefers to speak of the gentleness and friendliness of the animals he knows like his own children.<br/>“Camels can endure everything: sun, wind, sand and lack of water, and if they could talk, you’d easily hear how intelligent they are,” he said.</p>

      <p><b>"The desert knows me"</b><br/>Dlimi comes from a long line of desert dwellers from the Ouled Dlimi tribe.<br/>As tradition dictates, he lists his ancestors going back five generations when introducing himself.<br/>“I know the desert and the desert knows me,” he said.<br/>Like elsewhere, the nomads of Western Sahara are settling, following a shift from rural to urban living.<br/>“Young people prefer to stay in town,” Dlimi said, and herders now mostly come from neighboring Mauritania, whose desert north is traversed by caravans of up to a thousand camels.<br/>Even they “often demand to work in areas covered by (mobile phone) network signal,” he added.<br/>The population of the nearby town of Dakhla has tripled to 100,000 in 20 years, with growth driven by fishing, tourism and greenhouse farming encouraged by Morocco.<br/>In this part of Western Sahara, development projects depend entirely on Rabat.<br/>Morocco has controlled 80 percent of the former Spanish colony since the 1970s and wants to maintain it as an autonomous territory under its sovereignty.<br/>The Polisario Front movement fought a war for independence from 1975 to 1991 and wants a referendum in which the people of Western Sahara choose between independence and integration with Morocco.<br/>The United Nations has been trying to negotiate a political compromise for decades.<br/>Like many in his tribe, Dlimi has family members on the other side of the Western Sahara Wall separating the Moroccan controlled areas from the Polisario controlled areas.<br/>He favors loyalty to Morocco while others back independence, he said.<br/>Tribal affiliation trumps politics, though.<br/>“Tribes are tribes, it’s a social organization,” he said. “There are very strong links between us.”<br/>To “preserve the past for the future,” Dlimi started a cultural association to conserve traditions from a time when there were no borders and “families followed the herds and the clouds.”</p>

      <p><b>The irony</b><br/>While Dlimi loves the desert, he does have one complaint: “The camel dairy industry is valued everywhere in the world except here.”<br/>Camel milk is trendy with health-conscious consumers and the lean meat is excellent, Dlimi claims.<br/>Today though, it is small livestock farming that is the main agricultural focus, in response to what non-nomadic Moroccans tend to eat.<br/>The 266,000 square kilometers (106,400 square miles) of Western Sahara under Moroccan control hosts some 6,000 herders, 105,000 camels, and 560,000 sheep and goats, according to figures from Rabat.<br/>In other arid countries, including Saudi Arabia, intensive farming of camels has taken off.<br/>But, while Moroccan authorities have undertaken several studies into developing Western Sahara’s camel industry, these have not so far been acted upon.<br/>Regardless, a local adage holds that he who has no camel, has nothing.<br/>“Some say that Saharans are crazy because when they have money they spend it on four feet,” Dlimi jokes.<br/>For him, 20,000 dirhams ($2,000) spent on a camel is a safe investment.<br/>But it is also a consuming passion.<br/>His Facebook page and WhatsApp messages are filled with talk of camel husbandry techniques, research and racing.<br/>Racing “is a pleasure and it pays,” Dlimi said.<br/>Since the United Arab Emirates funded construction of a camel racing track at Tantan, 900 kilometers (560 miles) to the north, racing animals have appreciated in value and can sell for up to 120,000 dirhams, according to Dlimi.<br/>To train his racing camels, Dlimi chases the young animals across the desert in his 4X4.<br/>The technique has made him an eight-time champion in national competitions, he said.<br/>But camels can be stubborn, Dlimi stressed, telling of how he once sold his best champion for a “very good price,” but the animal refused to race once it had changed hands.</p>
