      <p>(CNN) - Asian markets tumbled Thursday, as worries grew over the possible delay of a preliminary trade deal between the United States and China.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index briefly slid 2.2% in early trading. It recovered some of those losses later in the morning and was last down 1.6%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined 1.7%. South Korea's Kospi also dropped 1.4%. China's Shanghai Composite Index was off 0.2%.</p>
      <p>US stocks closed lower on Wednesday, after a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-timing/a-us-china-phase-one-trade-deal-may-not-be-inked-this-year-idUSKBN1XU2C7">Reuters story said</a> the United States and China may not be able to reach a "phase one" deal as both sides have heightened demands of their own.</p>
      <p>US President Trump told reporters on Wednesday after US markets closedthat he is not ready to make a deal with China because he didn't think that China was "stepping up to the level" that he wanted.</p>
      <p>Tensions are also rising between the two countries over the political situation in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>China strongly condemned on Wednesday the US Senate's passage of a bill that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/asia/hong-kong-senate-democracy-bill-intl-hnk/index.html">supports human rights in Hong Kong</a>. China said it would take "forceful countermeasures" if the United States presses ahead with the bill.</p>
      <p>US futures fell further during Asian trading hours on Thursday. Futures for the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq were all down 0.2%.</p>
