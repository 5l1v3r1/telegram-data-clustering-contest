      <h1>Hey, New York, stop sending me money!</h1>

      <p>You are going to laugh at the story I’m about to tell you, especially if you find it funny when taxpayer money is wasted because of slapstick incompetence.</p>
      <p>And hopefully this is the only case of its kind, although I doubt it.</p>
      <p>I will call the woman who wrote to me Charlotte because she didn’t want to be identified. But the New York City agencies involved know who she is. I’ll let Charlotte start telling the story.</p>
      <p>“During a long period of unemployment, I briefly received SNAP benefits,” she explained. SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, is a federally subsidized way to make sure people are getting enough food. The program is administered by the city’s Human Resource Administration, or HRA.</p>
      <p>I’ll let Charlotte, who works freelance for living, continue:</p>
      <p>“I went back to work after Memorial Day 2018 and submitted paperwork in early June 2018, as required, to terminate my benefits,” she says.</p>
      <p>But that request was ignored and Charlotte kept getting benefits from the city — even after she resubmitted the paperwork in late July. “They finally terminated SNAP benefits on Sept. 20, 2018,” she said.</p>
      <p>But the problem didn’t end because there was another benefit that went along with SNAP — assistance in paying heating bills— that Charlotte has been trying unsuccessfully to cancel ever since.</p>
      <p>“Since my SNAP benefits were terminated, I have been contacted five times by HRA’s Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) and by Con Edison informing me I am being automatically enrolled in a utility rate reduction program and/or will receive supplemental benefits,” Charlotte says.</p>
      <p>“They claim I am receiving social service benefits and can’t afford my energy bills on my own,” she says. “I have had to make numerous phone calls to both agencies to un-enroll.”</p>
      <p>But the calls never worked and — while the total she was receiving amounted to a total of only a few hundred bucks, the money kept going to her SNAP bank account.</p>

      <p>She even sent a certified letter. That didn’t work.</p>
      <p>“After receiving the third notice of automatic enrollment in April 2019, I sent a Certified Letter/Return Receipt to HRA/HEAP reminding them I am not eligible to receive social service benefits and requesting termination from their active database,” Charlotte said.</p>
      <p>Nope, that didn’t work.</p>
      <p>“Shortly thereafter, I received a fourth notice but it likely crossed my letter in the mail. But I just received another (the fifth) notice that HEAP is intervening on my behalf with Con Edison and automatically enrolling me in the rate reduction,” Charlotte explained.</p>
      <p>When was the last time you heard of a person saying, “Please stop sending me money,” so many times without success?</p>
      <p>“I was grateful to receive temporary assistance during my hardship, particularly as I had paid into the system for 30 years through income taxes. But I no longer need the money and it’s disgusting to have my and other hardworking taxpayers’ money given away by the city to people who don’t need it,” she said.</p>
      <p>I don’t mind a few people getting benefits they don’t deserve. There are always going to some of them. But here’s a woman who has been trying for almost a year and a half to stop receiving benefits — and needed to reach out to me before that was accomplished.</p>
      <p>What if there are a million people out there getting a few hundred dollars they don’t deserve?</p>
      <p>I contacted HRA for Charlotte — and now they tell her she is definitely unenrolled in any benefits program.</p>
      <p>Says the HRA: Charlotte “should have been dis-enrolled from SNAP as she requested, when she requested it.” The agency blamed human error for that not happening.</p>
      <p>“Our accidental oversight in doing so resulted in (her) being automatically enrolled in another benefit that we typically offer to individuals receiving assistance. Upon learning of this error (from me) we promptly resolved the situation,” a spokesman for HRA said.</p>
      <p>Hey, I’m always happy to fix a problem. Now I think the city should inspect it’s assistance rolls for others who don’t deserve benefits. There are certainly enough other people out there who honestly need help.</p>
      <p>*</p>
      <p>If you want to know everything about real estate, attend next year’s Capital Markets in Real Estate conference held by the Schack Institute of New York University’s School of Professional Studies.</p>
      <p>I attended last week and since I assume you didn’t, let me fill you in on the sentiment in one single quote: “Every piece of real estate in the US is fully valued. There isn’t much upside,” said Boyd Fellow, managing partner at Acore Capital.</p>
      <p>It didn’t seem like any of the many speakers for the day disagreed with him and there were some fine folks there including real estate hotshots Larry Silverstein, Stephen Ross, Bill Rudin and Maryanne Gilmartin.</p>
      <p>Among the worries are the economy, politics and the fact that demographics in the US are changing now that Baby Boomers are saying adios to the Northeast and to life in general.</p>
