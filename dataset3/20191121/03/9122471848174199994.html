      <h1>Cleveland Browns Player Says He’s Been Receiving Death Threats</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:14:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>A Cleveland Browns player says he’s been receiving death threats in the wake of Thursday night’s game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p>
      <p>Damarious Randall, a 27-year-old safety, was ejected from last week’s game for his hit on Steelers receiver Diontae Johnson.</p>
      <p>The hit to the head took Johnson out of the game, as the wideout reportedly suffered a concussion. Randall says the hit was not intentional.</p>
      <p>Randall is not happy with the comments and threats being sent his way following the hit.</p>
      <p>“How is it, from the standpoint, after the hit . . . I get so many death threats, so many people calling me names, people saying, ‘Oh, I hope you get hurt; I’m going to kill you, this and that,’” <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/browns-damarious-randall-laments-so-many-death-threats-on-his-social-media-after-getting-ejected-from-steelers-game.html">Randall said, per Cleveland.com</a>, “and it’s OK for fans to do it to us, but then when we say something back, it’s a problem, [and] we get in trouble? I just never understood that.”</p>
      <p>Randall added that he was shaken up by what happened.</p>
      <p>“I clearly hit him helmet-to-helmet, but I was just saying some prayers about it and that actually bothered me a little bit that he was laying there like that, because it just shows how dangerous this game is and how dangerous this game can be. Really, I just never intend to hurt anyone,’’ Randall said.</p>
      <p>Of course, this was not the only major incident during Thursday night’s game. It ended with the Myles Garrett melee.</p>
      <p>We’ll get Browns-Steelers again in two weeks. It’s going to be an intense one.</p>
