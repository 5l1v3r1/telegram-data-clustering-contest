      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has echoed Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim’s remark that those with ambitions to lead the country must do so through legitimate means.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Dr Mahathir’s anointed successor said the position of the prime minister must not be won through clandestine measures such as “secretive meetings.”</p>
      <p>“We agree with him, it must be through the right way,” Dr Mahathir said when asked for his views on Anwar’s remarks, after launching the Social Well-Being Conference 2019 at the Grand Hyatt Hotel here this morning. </p>
      <p>Yesterday, Anwar issued the critical remarks when commenting on his deputy, Datuk Seri Azmin Ali’s furtive meeting with 22 Umno MPs at the latter’s official residence in Putrajaya on Monday.</p>
      <p>On the possible reshuffle of the Cabinet, Dr Mahathir said he would raise this during the next Pakatan Harapan presidential council meeting.</p>
      <p>However, Dr Mahathir joked that he was sure the ministers would have already learnt of this through news reports.</p>
      <p>“I will convey that when we have our meeting of Pakatan Harapan, but I think they read the newspapers; thank you for publicising. </p>
      <p>“I know the press is more anxious to see this reshuffle than the ministers themselves,” he added. </p>
      <p>Yesterday, Dr Mahathir revealed that he would consider reshuffling his Cabinet reshuffle, after several critics blamed under-performing ministers for PH’s loss in the Tanjung Piai by-election.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he would take ministers’ parliamentary attendance into account for the reshuffle, the prime minister only said their positions were his prerogative.</p>
