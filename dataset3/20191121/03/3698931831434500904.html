      <h1>Huawei Nova 6 with two selfie cameras and 5G is launching in December</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:49:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/06/21/huawei-nova-5-5i-5-pro-officially-announced/">Nova 5 series</a> is barely 5 months old and Huawei is about to launch its new Nova 6 series next month in China. This is Huawei’s popular mid-range series and they are doubling things up with two selfie cameras on a punch-hole display.</p>

      <p>According to Huawei’s Weibo page, the Huawei Nova 6 will be revealed on the 5th December 2019 and this is also the first Nova smartphone to support 5G connectivity.</p>
      <p>In the brief teaser video, it shows a rather large FullView display that has a wide punch-hole to house two selfie cameras. The punch-hole looks similar to the Galaxy S10+ and the second camera is expected to be an ultra-wide-angle shooter. The front of the Huawei Nova 6 looks quite similar to the <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/13/honor-v30-launch-5g-smartphone/">Honor V30</a> that’s launching next week.</p>
      <p>For the top-spec variant, it is likely to run on a Kirin 990 chip with 5G and it is speculated to feature a 6.44″ IPS display. Looking at the right side of the device, it appears to retain a flush side-mounted fingerprint sensor which is similar to the current <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/09/11/huawei-nova-5t-unboxing-hands-on/">Huawei Nova 5T</a>. The device is also expected to come with a 4,000mAh battery and it could support Huawei’s 40W SuperCharge power brick via USB-C.</p>
      <p>With the ongoing restrictions from the US Government, the Huawei Nova 6 will not come with Google Mobile Services pre-installed if it were to be released globally. Similar to the Huawei Mate 30 series, Huawei will be shipping their devices with Huawei Mobile Services that comes with its own AppGallery.</p>
