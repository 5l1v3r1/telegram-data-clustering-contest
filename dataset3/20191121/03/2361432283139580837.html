      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:09:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/tim-b/" target="_blank">Tim Baysinger</a></address>

      <p>Lizzo will be the musical guest for Murphy’s long-awaited return to Studio 8H on Dec. 21. Lopez will host on Dec. 7 with DaBaby as the musical guest, with Johansson taking over on Dec. 14, with Niall Horan as musical guest. This will be the third time for Lopez and the sixth for Johansson.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is DaBaby’s “SNL” debut and the first time that Horan will perform solo (he previously performed with One Direction) on the NBC late-night franchise.</p>

      <p>This will be Murphy’s first time hosting “SNL” since 1984. He was last seen on the show for a brief appearance on the 40th anniversary special, “SNL 40,” in 2015. He is in the middle of a comeback with his Netflix film, “Dolemite is My Name” and will return as Prince Akeem in “Coming 2 America,” the sequel to his 1988 comedy. That film will be out next December.</p>
      <p>Last week, Netflix bought the rights from Paramount for a fourth “Beverly Hills Cop” film, which will also see Murphy return as Axel Foley.</p>
      <p>This week, another “SNL” alum in Will Ferrell will be hosting — marking his fifth time — with King Princess as the musical guest.</p>
