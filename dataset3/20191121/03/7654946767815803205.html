      <h1>Whistleblower claims WeWork rubber-stamped acquisition during Adam Neumann reign</h1>

      <p>Adam Neumann may have <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/22/wework-accepts-softbanks-takeover-plan/">departed from WeWork months ago</a>, but the mess he left behind continues to linger.</p>
      <p>Already plagued with complaints that Neumann was self-dealing, WeWork is now facing claims that it rubber-stamped a deal to buy a smaller rival.</p>
      <p>In August, WeWork executives pushed through a $42.5 million acquisition of 3-year-old startup Spacious by demanding outside accountants OK the deal without reviewing the company’s financial statements, according to a whistleblower complaint filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in October.</p>
      <p>Accounting experts say it’s unheard of for a company to move forward with an acquisition without seeking a professional review of the financials.</p>
      <p>“There couldn’t be a more basic step done in due diligence,” tax and accounting expert Robert Willens told The Post. “The SEC might feel that’s enough of a lead to begin an investigation.”</p>
      <p>The SEC is already investigating WeWork over whether it violated its rules in seeking a public stock listing, according to Bloomberg. The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/new-york-state-attorney-general-investigating-wework/">New York Attorney General is also probing the company</a> over whether Neumann engaged in self-dealing to enrich himself, according to Reuters.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower complaint, filed with the SEC on Oct. 1, makes clear the complainant doesn’t know why the deal may have been rubber-stamped, but it raises questions about the Spacious business model, suggesting WeWork vastly overpaid.</p>
      <p>Spacious, founded in NYC in 2016, turns restaurants that sit empty during the day into co-working spaces. When it was bought by WeWork, it boasted a handful of co-working spaces in NYC — including Bar Primi — and in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>During an average month, Spacious, which charges $20 a day for drop-in office space, had $4.5 million in working capital and recorded little if any profit, documents obtained by The Post show.</p>
      <p>Spacious investors included Lerer Hippeau, a VC firm headed in part by Eric Hippeau, who’s a former executive at Japanese investment firm SoftBank.</p>
      <p>In a statement, WeWork said it “engaged an outside advisor to conduct financial and tax due diligence on this deal. The decision to acquire the business was based on market data and go forward strategic plans, as is common industry practice.”</p>
      <p>Neumann stepped down as WeWork’s CEO in September after IPO plans were thwarted amid nonstop reports of Neumann’s self-dealing. The Israeli billionaire, 40, came under fire for buying properties that he then leased back to WeWork, and for charging his own company $6 million to use the word “We,” which he had trademarked for himself.</p>
      <p>Neumann — who walked away with $1.7 billion after the company was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/23/softbank-clinches-deal-to-buy-wework-that-bails-out-founder/">rescued by investor SoftBank</a> — also faced questions over his management style. He reportedly banned employees from expensing meals with meat, and sold multiple hundred million dollars of shares that weren’t disclosed in IPO docs.</p>
      <p>One report said a jet owner had to recall a plane Neumann was on after the crew found marijuana in a cereal box on the flight.</p>
