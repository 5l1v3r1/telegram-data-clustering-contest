      <p>BANGKOK (AP) — The Latest on Pope Francis’s visit to Thailand and Japan (all times local):</p>
      <p>6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Thousands of people have filled Bangkok’s national sports stadium for Pope Francis’ first public Mass in Thailand.</p>
      <p>Francis was circling around the stadium in his popemobile Thursday as the crowd waved yellow and white Holy See flags and chanted “Via il papa!”</p>
      <p>The Mass capped a busy first day for the pope in Asia. It included separate meetings with Thailand’s prime minister, supreme Buddhist leader and recently crowned king.</p>
      <p>Throughout his stay, Francis has been accompanied by Sister Ana Rosa Sivori, his second cousin who is serving as his interpreter.</p>
      <p>By all indications, she is also serving as a counselor. She has joined him in the car for his appointments, taking the usual place of the archbishop. It’s a rare case of the pope consulting a woman for advice, since his usual counselors are all men.</p>

      <p>Pope Francis is committing the Catholic Church to working more with Thailand’s majority Buddhists to launch projects to care for the poor and the environment.</p>
      <p>Francis made the pledge during a meeting Thursday with the supreme Buddhist patriarch at the Wat Ratchabophit temple. It was the second time a pope has called on the spiritual leader of Thailand’s Buddhists, after St. John Paul II visited the temple in 1984.</p>
      <p>There are fewer than 400,000 Catholics among Thailand’s 65 million people, yet Francis said they nevertheless have enjoyed freedom in their religious practice.</p>
      <p>He called for increasing charitable initiatives to improve fraternity and to help the poor “and our much-abused common home.”</p>

      <p>Pope Francis has called for migrants to be welcomed and for women and children to be protected from exploitation, abuse and enslavement as he began a busy two days of activities in Thailand.</p>
      <p>Francis pleaded for action against one of the region’s greatest scourges — human trafficking to fuel the forced labor and sex trade industries — as he opened a weeklong visit to Asia on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He praised the Thai government’s efforts to fight human trafficking in a speech at host Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha’s offices. But he appealed for greater international commitment to protect women and children “who are violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse.”</p>
      <p>He called for ways to “uproot this evil and to provide ways to restore their dignity.”</p>
