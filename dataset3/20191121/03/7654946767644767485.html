      <p>Google’s new video-game streaming service is a lag-riddled, nausea-inducing disaster.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/google-stadia-has-launched-but-there-are-a-lot-of-kinks/">Stadia, which launched this week</a>, aims to eliminate the need for expensive consoles and cumbersome hardware by letting users access Google’s ample processing power through the internet.</p>
      <p>But the convenience of relying on Google’s servers to stream games is also what dooms it.</p>
      <p>Why? With Stadia, your game-play experience is reliant on the strength of your wireless connection.</p>
      <p>My apartment has a strong signal that has never given me any trouble streaming 4K movies or playing online Xbox games, but it apparently wasn’t good enough for Stadia.</p>
      <p>The Wi-Fi-connected controller experienced a half-second of input lag, meaning that any button I pressed saw a delayed reaction on-screen.</p>
      <p>That resulted in missed shots in shooting games like “Destiny,” broken combos in “Mortal Kombat,” and many, many deaths in “Tomb Raider.”</p>
      <p>The lag was so bad in some instances that a friend who came to try it out with me ended up with a case of motion sickness due to the lagging in-game camera controls.</p>
      <p>He stopped playing after just 15 minutes.</p>
      <p>That’s not all. Stadia’s selection of games is paltry.</p>
      <p>Beyond last year’s hit “Red Dead Redemption 2,” there’s nothing that makes Stadia a must-buy.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would sooner direct someone toward a PlayStation or Xbox on sale for $200 on Black Friday than recommend shelling out the $130 Google is asking for the Stadia Premiere Edition, which comes with a controller as well as a Google Chromecast Ultra.</p>
      <p>My week with Stadia actually gave me a greater appreciation for the gaming console I already own, rather than making me think about selling it.</p>
      <p>Still, Stadia is a glorious proof-of-concept, and it seems like the bones for a console-less future are there. Setup took just a few minutes, and only involved plugging in a Google Chromecast Ultra into my TV and downloading the Stadia app.</p>
      <p>Adding games to my library was a matter of picking and choosing which ones I wanted, and prevented the hours of waiting required to download massive files on consoles like the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
      <p>I’m not writing Stadia off for good. Although Google has a well-documented track record of killing its pet projects, it has also turned Gmail and YouTube into juggernauts.</p>
      <p>But Stadia still needs work, and is impossible to recommend to anyone who takes games seriously.</p>
      <p>If Google can iron out the kinks and expand its library, Stadia will be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
      <p>Until then, it’s just a mess.</p>
