      <p>The Hollywood Reporter mentioned that on October 7, 2019, Todd Phillips had a meet with Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich after the film made a collection of $96.2 on its first weekend. THR report stated that Todd asked Toby for the rights to develop a portfolio of DC Characters’ origin stories via his films. However, Emmerich was quite hesitant to give the rights as DC is very protective of their characters.</p>
      <p>But Todd did manage to get the rights of making another DC story, reveals the sources. As Phoenix’s Joker crossed $1 billion mark worldwide, the makers are now gearing up for the sequel which will be helmed by Phillips. But the studio and director’s team have refused to comment on anything regarding the sequel.</p>
      <p>If the sequel is indeed happening, it’s great news for all the Joker, Joaquin and DC fans. After all, who doesn’t want to watch another phenomenal craft on the big screen?</p>
