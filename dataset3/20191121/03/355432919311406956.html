      <h1>Yang says white supremacist violence should be designated domestic terrorism</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:49:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>Tech entrepreneur <a href="https://thehill.com/people/andrew-yang">Andrew Yang</a> said Wednesday during the Democratic presidential debate that he would designate white supremacist violence as domestic terrorism. </p>
      <p>Yang’s answer was in response to a question on how to fight the rise of white supremacy. </p>
      <p>Designating white supremacist violence as domestic terrorism would be the first step in curbing the issue, Yang said. </p>
      <p>He said leaders have to “start finding a way” to turn boys into “healthy strong young men” with “healthy paths forward.” </p>
      <p>His answer expands on Yang’s <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/fight-white-nationalism-extremism/">proposal</a> to fight the rise of white nationalism and extremism, in which he says he would instruct the Department of Justice to treat white nationalism and domestic terrorism as a “central focus.” </p>
      <p>His proposal also calls for increasing the budget for fighting domestic terrorism. </p>
