      <p>While some people still aren‚Äôt convinced that <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29574145/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-relationship-timeline/">Miley Cyrus and Cody Simpson‚Äôs relationship</a> was even real to begin with (please refer to <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29623352/miley-cyrus-body-language-cody-simpson-kaitlynn-carter-liam-hemsworth/">body-language expert Blanca Cobb‚Äôs analysis</a> for a full explanation), there are rumors that their time together has come to an abrupt halt.</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, gossip site<a href="https://radaronline.com/exclusives/2019/11/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-split-on-break-whirlwind-romance/"> <i>Radar Onlin</i>e claimed that Miley is ‚Äútaking a break‚Äù from Cody</a> and all the nonstop PDA posts that came with their relationship. If you look at their feeds right now, you‚Äôll see that the last time they posted about each other was right after Halloween. BTW, <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29688045/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-date-brother-braison-wedding/">Miley did post a pic with Cody</a> when they went to her brother‚Äôs wedding together, but it seems she‚Äôs deleted it.</p>
      <p>The <i>Radar</i> source also added that while they reportedly want to remain friends, Miley wants to focus on herself right now.</p>

      <p>As if their relationship weren‚Äôt confusing enough already, an <i>E! News</i> source basically claimed the <i>Radar</i> report was completely false. <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29840827/miley-cyrus-cody-simpson-breakup-reports/">They said</a>, ‚ÄúMiley and Cody saw each other last week when he visited her in Tennessee. They are fine and are still dating. Miley has been resting from her vocal surgery but has been in touch and seen Cody recently.‚Äù</p>
      <p>Well, Miley hasn‚Äôt commented on any of that, but Cody took to his Instagram Story, seemingly in an attempt to squash all the split rumors. Before he posted pictures of his spiked hair and captioned it, ‚ÄúC‚Äômon baby yeah c‚Äômon just a little bit more,‚Äù he revealed that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29868601/cody-simpson-miley-cyrus-breakup-rumors-response/">his phone screen saver is an adorable picture of bb Miley</a>.</p>
