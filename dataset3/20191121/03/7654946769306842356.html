      <p>A 23-year-old Mexican trainer and fitness model was found shot in the head and stabbed multiple times inside her home, local reports said.</p>
      <p>Alondra Getsemani Villaseñor’s mother made the grisly discovery Sunday night when she went to check on her daughter, who hadn’t answered several phone calls, <a href="https://heraldodemexico.com.mx/estados/modelo-fitness-entrenadora-asesinada-tijuana-alindra-getsemani-villasenor-munoz-disparo-heridas-arma-blanca-feminicidio-baja-california/">The Herald of Mexico reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The young woman, who lived in Tijuana, had been dead for at least 24 hours, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Police found a 9mm bullet casing and two small bags apparently containing marijuana at the scene.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said they saw someone, believed to be the killer, fleeing Villaseñor’s home in a red vehicle.</p>
      <p>Villaseñor worked as an instructor at a local gym, according to the outlet.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made. Investigators have not yet revealed a possible motive for the murder.</p>
      <p>Tijuana, a border city in the Mexican state of Baja California, saw close to 1,800 murders this year, compared to a record 2,518 murders last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/04/bloody-tijuana-mexico-murderous-border-city-week">The Guardian recently reported</a>.</p>
