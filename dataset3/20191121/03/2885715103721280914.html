      <h2>Director SS Rajamouli on Wednesday announced new additions to the cast of his upcoming film RRR, which stars Ram Charan and Jr NTR in the lead roles.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:49:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>Director SS Rajamouli on Wednesday announced that he has handpicked British stage actor Olivia Morris to play one of the female leads in his next directorial RRR.</p>
      <p>“Welcome aboard #OliviaMorris @OliviaMorris891! We are happy to have you play the female lead #JENNIFER. Looking forward for the shoot (sic),” read an announcement on the film’s official Twitter handle.</p>
      <p>Olivia Morris is a graduate of Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama. According to IMDb, she has not worked in a film so far. However, she has appeared in a single episode of a mini-series called 7 Trails in 7 Days. Hence, RRR will mark her big screen debut.</p>
      <p>After months of search, Rajamouli handpicked Olivia to replace British actor Daisy Edgar-Jones, who opted out of the project due to “unavoidable circumstances.” She was hired to share screen space with Jr NTR in the period drama.</p>
      <p>Now, Olivia will play Jennifer, the romantic interest of Tarak’s Komaram Bheem.</p>
      <p>The producers also introduced popular Hollywood actor Ray Stevenson. Known for his roles in television series like Rome and Dexter, Stevenson will be seen as the main antagonist, Scott, in the film. Seasoned Irish actor Alison Doody will also play a key role in the film.</p>
      <p>“Welcome to Indian cinema, #AlisonDoody! Had a wonderful time shooting for your first schedule… We are glad to have you play lead antagonist #LADYSCOTT in #RRRMovie! #RRR (sic)” read a tweet on RRR’s handle.</p>

      <p>Olivia Morris and Ray Stevenson will start shooting for the film soon.</p>
      <p>The production of RRR hit multiple snags following the injury of Tarak and Ram Charan in separate incidents. And Daisy Edgar’s exit had raised concerns over the completion of the project. According to the filmmakers, about 70 per cent of the shooting is completed so far. The latest announcements were made with the primary intention of putting the rumours about the fate of the project to rest.</p>
      <p>RRR is a fictional story based on the struggles of Telugu tribal leaders Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem. While Ram Charan is playing Sitarama, Tarak will essay the role of Komaram. Rajamouli has also roped in Bollywood actors <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/alia-bhatt/">Alia Bhatt</a> and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ajay-devgan/">Ajay Devgan</a> to play pivotal roles in the film, which is being made at an estimated budget of more than Rs 300 crore.</p>
      <p>It is expected to release in multiple languages on July 30, 2020.</p>
