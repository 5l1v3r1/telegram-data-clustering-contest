      <p>Two days after the death of 12-year-old boy allegedly due to the negligence of the hospital staff at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), police are yet to file an FIR in connection with the case.</p>
      <p>The incident happened on last Sunday, when Sonu, who lived with his family in Zirakpur, was taken to PGIMER as he was suffering from Jaundice. Sonu’s family members alleged that he died after a nurse in the emergency ward administered an injection to him.</p>
      <p>While the police said that they are waiting for the report from the PGIMER’s internal committee, the hospital authorities said that it will take a few days to find out who was responsible for the child’s death.</p>
      <p>Though he was officially declared dead Monday morning, his relatives claimed that the 12-year-old died right after he was given the injection.</p>
      <p>“I had gone to buy the prescribed medicines from Ankit Pharmacy which is on the same floor as the emergency ward. When I brought them, a nurse filled the syringe with a medicine without even checking what it is, and immediately injected it into Sonu. His head suddenly plopped and he looked lifeless. We are sure he died right then and there,” said Pratap, Sonu’s brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>After the injection was administered, hospital staff had put Sonu on the ventilator till Monday morning until he was declared dead. “They just put him on the ventilator to hide the fact that it was the negligence of the pharmacist and the nurse that caused Sonu’s death,” claimed Pratap.</p>
      <p>PGIMER’s Additional PRO Anil Joshi said, “It will take a few days to say whether it was due to the negligence of the staff or not. We will have to wait for the committee formed by the director to declare their results.”</p>
      <p>As of now, a Daily Diary Register (DDR) has been filed in connection with the matter at Sector 11 Police Station. “We have to wait for the results of the internal committee formed by the PGI Director Jagat Ram, as well as the findings of the toxicology report before filing an FIR. The toxicology report will take at least one-and-a-half months to be ready,” said Inspector Rajeev of Sector 11 police station.</p>
      <p>“We did not know there is any difference between a DDR and and an FIR. Now, I don’t know how long we will have to wait until some action is taken,” Pratap added.</p>
