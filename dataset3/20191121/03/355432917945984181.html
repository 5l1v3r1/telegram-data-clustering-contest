      <p><a href="https://thehill.com/people/andrew-yang">Andrew Yang</a> joked on Wednesday that if he's elected president in 2020, his first words to Russian President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> would offer condolences. </p>
      <p>"Sorry I beat your guy," Yang said during the fifth Democratic debate when asked what he would say in his first call with Putin. </p>

      <p>The remark was a reference to <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, who has repeatedly heaped praise on Putin and whose 2016 presidential victory was at the center of a years-long investigation into whether Russian officials sought to interfere in the U.S. political process.</p>
      <p>Yang said that Russia's interference in American democracy would also be a key topic of discussion in a phone call with Putin. </p>
      <p>"I would say the days of meddling in our elections are over," Yang, a former tech executive, said.</p>
      <p>National security officials have already warned that Moscow is taking steps to meddle in the 2020 presidential race.</p>
