      <h3>Carlton star Charlie Curnow has suffered yet another pre-season setback on his troublesome right knee — after another accidental incident away from the club.</h3>
      <p>The Blues released a statement on Thursday, confirming Curnow had suffered a fractured patella after slipping on tiles while walking upstairs on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The injury setback, which resulted in Curnow heading straight to hospital,<a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/afl/afl-2020-preseason-charlie-curnow-knee-injury-hurts-knee-playing-basketball-carlton-injury-news/news-story/7f1b8e62e6b2c163f3d8c6a78383c09d"> is separate to his previous injury, which was caused by playing basketball</a>.</p>

      <p>Curnow’s fresh injury concern will keep him sidelined until the new year and puts the forward in severe doubt for the club’s Round 1 clash with Richmond.</p>
      <p>The club said the incident occurred on the same knee, but the slip caused a high-level contraction to his quadriceps muscle. Consequently, a large force went through his whole knee that his patella could not tolerate.</p>
      <p>The young Blue is slated to miss a number of months and won’t run until early 2020.</p>
      <p>“The recovery time for a fractured knee cap is typically three to four months. This will delay his return to running until the New Year, which means it is unlikely he will be available for our pre-season games in late-February and early-March,” Carlton head of football Brad Lloyd said.</p>

      <p>“Charlie is understandably very disappointed right now but our entire football club, and I’m sure our members included, will give Charlie all the support he needs to get through this frustrating period.</p>
      <p>“He is a resilient character, and we have no doubt, knowing the competitor he is, he will be back to playing good football in the Navy Blue in 2020.”</p>
      <p>Curnow missed 10 games through the 2019 season due to a knee injury, suffering a setback in March and then missing the last seven games of the year as well.</p>
