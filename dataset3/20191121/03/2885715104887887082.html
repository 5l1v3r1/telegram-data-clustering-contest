      <p>THE ECONOMIC Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai police has sought documents related to earnings of Yash Raj Films (YRF) Private Limited from royalty for the songs in their movies. This comes after an FIR was lodged on the basis of a complaint that the company had not paid 50 per cent royalty to singers, lyricists and music composers who performed in their films since 2012.</p>
      <p>The police will be checking documentation between the production house, artistes associated with their films and the royalty collection body Indian Performing Rights Society (IPRS) to verify the allegations.</p>
      <p>A senior officer said, “We will need to check records of the royalty earned by YRF from these songs and how much money they paid as royalty.”</p>
      <p>The officer said that as per the amendment to the Copyright Act in 2012, the production house should have paid the artistes 50 per cent of the royalty they earned every time a song was used by a streaming device or at a function. “We will also be recording statements of the artistes associated with them…” he said.</p>
      <p>A senior member of IPRS said they first wrote to YRF last year, asking them to pay the royalty due. “After we started writing to them, artistes were paid small amounts. However, they were not paid the 50 per cent that they should have been paid,” he alleged.</p>
      <p>After negotiations between YRF and IPRS did not lead to any resolution, IPRS lodged a written complaint with Amboli police two months ago. Since the estimated amount involved was Rs 100 crore as per the complaint, the matter was transferred to EOW.</p>

      </p>
      <p>An officer said they will first have to establish the royalty YRF earned from these songs and the amount paid to the artistes.</p>
      <p>The police last week registered an FIR against YRF on the charge of criminal breach of trust along with relevant sections of the Copyright Act. YRF did not respond to the FIR till late on Wednesday evening.</p>
