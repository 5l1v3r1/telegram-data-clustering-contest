      <p>They better be sincere on this very special day literally!</p>
      <p>What about that elite photographer you've booked for your day?! what of the make up artist?</p>
      <p>Oh well, may your village people not come in between this day by messing up the schedules of these very important service providers.</p>
      <p>Well, congratulations! You’ve made it through the college struggles, put in the work and hureeey! Finally you've got to the finish line and, here you are waving the graduation cap tagging your fiends in pictures with “mama I made it” captions and making the worth some memories in many years to come.</p>
      <p>So you’re officially a college graduate... what now?</p>
      <p>You may not have a job just yet or any other activity to keep you busy during the day. Your siblings, parents and guardians might already be on your neck making demands or already asking disturbing questions. Relax...the journey has just began.</p>
      <p>Completing college isn't the commencement of a fulfilling career life but rather a bumpy ride which will leave you with more lessons than overnight success and what is beautiful about that experience is it will all be worthwhile.</p>
      <p>Don’t even begin comparing yourself to your college mates who you think have already started making it...each individuals' journey is different and in the long run we all get to it whichever way--you'll get there, you will.</p>
      <p>Sit back relax, take a deep breath and clear your mind of anything that is meant to confuse you.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, this journey is yours and yours alone...so now what's next after that graduation ceremony ?</p>
      <p>Visit Your Family, Travel</p>
      <p>This is definitely the perfect time to make the right choices with a clear relaxed mind...what of visiting your parents and siblings in the suburb's or your village? You now can create memories with the ones you love and use this time to reconnect with family and friends. Suggest a family vacation and help plan it.</p>
      <p>You can also go out with friends you haven’t been able to see or hang out with in a while and make wonderful memories together. Well, relax you need that don't be too hard on yourself.</p>
      <p>Commit yourself to learn a new skill or hobby</p>
      <p>There’s nothing like me time or doing something for yourself that you never got to do. Another way to spend your time is opening your mind to learn a new skill and you may never know where the new learned skill might take you. Cooking, interior design &amp; decor, public speaking, coding, graphic design, photography, sports and painting. Don’t take it lightly but however unprofessional the skill might look like it has people earn a living out of it.</p>
      <p>YouTube offers millions of free classes on anything, make good use of that ...you are just a bundle away from learning a new skill. You now have a reason to stay on YouTube rather than watching that series or just watching pointless gists or music videos from tabloid online TVs.</p>
      <p>Sign up for a salsa class, learn a new language, take a fitness zumba, cycling and spin class etc...Do something worthwhile this time. You could also look into expanding your professional skill set by taking a course that might make you more marketable to jobs when you begin applying. Sites like lynda.com, edx, coursera, udemy among many others provide a huge lists of professional courses you could take and offer certification as well.</p>
      <p>Volunteer in a community service project</p>
      <p>Life after college will bring you so much free time you never knew you needed.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in giving back to your community, then this is the perfect time. There are dozens of projects everywhere that can be reached locally in different places. You just have to find that passion of yours and see how you could lend a hand to those in need.</p>
      <p>Although you may not have a job just yet, dedicating your time to community service can give you a mission or purpose. Volunteer work and setting time aside to give back will definitely make you productive and of course expand your network, polish your skills especially interaction with people boosts your social skills as well. Your resume eventually will stand out among the rest in a job contest.</p>
      <p>Spend time with Yourself</p>
      <p>While you’re closing one chapter of your life and walking into new doors with new opportunities, use this time to simply take care of yourself. Write lists: goals, dreams, things to do, or even affirmations and intentions that you have for yourself at this new beginning</p>
      <p>Network</p>
      <p>Networking is actually a skill that most people shy away from, forget how important it is, or don’t have much experience with at all. Due to the fact that we have alumnus in college and that you are one of them, it's a great place to start building your network.</p>
      <p>Fellow alumni members are always more willing to help recent graduates get their foot in the door, guide you to the best people to talk to for advice, or even set up possible interviews. Also look for networking events that go on in your city, and use your social media to your advantage.</p>
      <p>Meeting people in person to ask for advice will help you to build a relationship with them that will help you get that job you want.</p>
      <p>Eventually, if you do these 5 things consistently, starting now, I’m confident that you’ll end up having the career and life you desire.</p>
      <p>Literally speaking, It won’t always be easy. It certainly won’t be stress free. There will be setbacks. There will be days you’ll want to quit, but there will also be days you’ll be jumping with joy.</p>
      <p>Congratulations on completing that college life phase. Live your best life but carry your brain with you.</p>
