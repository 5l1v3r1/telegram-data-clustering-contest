      <h1>Biden says Trump could face prosecution after leaving office</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T03:05:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 03:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rebecca-klar" target="_blank">Rebecca Klar</a></address>
      <p>President <a href="https://thehill.com/person/trump">Trump</a> could face prosecution after leaving office, former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> said during Wednesday’s debate. </p>
      <p>Biden said he would not direct his Justice Department “like this president does" if he wins in 2020.</p>
      <p>“I would let them make an independent judgement,” he said, adding that it is not the role of the president or the “president’s attorney [but] it's the role of the attorney general."</p>
      <p>“If that was the judgement, that he violated the law and he should be criminally prosecuted, so be it,” Biden added.</p>
      <p>It’s not the first time Biden has said he would leave open the possibility of Trump’s prosecution; he reportedly made similar comments in July after former special counsel <a href="https://thehill.com/people/robert-mueller">Robert Mueller</a> testified before Congress on his investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. </p>
      <p>Biden's July remarks were made at an NAACP presidential candidate forum in Detroit, <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2019/07/biden-says-trump-could-face-indictment-after-leaving-white-house.html">MichiganLive.com</a> reports. </p>
      <p>House Democrats are investigating whether Trump sought to use a White House meeting and security assistance in order to pressure Ukraine to pursue investigations that could benefit the president politically.</p>
      <p>Trump has denied wrongdoing. </p>
      <p>U.S. Ambassador to the European Union <a href="https://thehill.com/people/gordon-sondland">Gordon Sondland</a> testified Wednesday as part of the impeachment inquiry that there was a clear quid pro quo deal.</p>
