      <p>SINGAPORE: Discoloured tap water was reported at some parts of the Basic Military Training Centre (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong on Wednesday morning (Nov 20), the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said.</p>
      <p>"BMTC is working with (national water agency) PUB to restore potable water supply at the earliest opportunity," MINDEF said on Thursday in response to queries sent by CNA on Wednesday. </p>

      <p>PUB told CNA on Thursday it received reports of discoloured tap water at BMTC at 7.30am on Wednesday, adding that its officers "immediately" went on-site to flush out the water network.</p>
      <p>"Essential water needs for servicemen, including drinking water and food preparation, have been met by alternative sources within BMTC and PUB-deployed water wagons," MINDEF said.</p>
      <p>The water wagons provide temporary water supply to "affected users", PUB elaborated.</p>
      <p>"PUB has collected water samples for testing and is currently investigating the cause of the incident," the agency stated.</p>
      <p>MINDEF said the safety and well-being of servicemen is of "paramount importance".</p>
      <p>In March 2018, then-Second Minister for Defence Ong Ye Kung <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/all-nsfs-to-undergo-bmt-on-pulau-tekong-10006400">told Parliament</a> that all full-time national servicemen, except those in elite and support vocations, will undergo BMT on Pulau Tekong.</p>
