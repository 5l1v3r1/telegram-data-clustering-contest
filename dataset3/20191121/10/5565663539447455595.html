      <h1>Police brutality getting out of hand in Zimbabwe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:47:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Esther Tafadzwa Munyira</a></address>
      <p>Editor, <br/><br/>The government of Zimbabwe has no intentions to reform as shown by the most barbaric, inhuman and degrading treatment of MDC supporters that were gathered outside harvest house in Harare yesterday. Their right of freedom of assembly has been violently wiped off by the unprovoked police who mercilessly beat up people. The government of Zimbabwe is at war with it's unarmed citizens who are surviving on one meal a day. The gathering was non violent and there was no need to beat people until they break legs.<br/><br/>Last week doctors were fired from work for asking the Government to review their salaries and working conditions. This left all hospitals with no staff. When a government official needs medical attention they simply fly abroad so they care less about what everybody else will do when they need medical attention.  This is gross denial of the population  the right to  health.   The government of Zimbabwe has failed beyond explanation and has brutalized and tormented it's own to cover up their corrupt and illegitimate entry into power.<br/><br/>Heartbroken <br/><br/>Esther Tafadzwa Munyira <br/>Human rights activist <br/>Middlesbrough</p>
