      <p>[<b>Update:</b> Square Enix has reached out to numerous outlets stating that Yoshida-san's statement was not an announcement but an "expression of hope" that <i>FF XIV</i> would one day appear on the PlayStation 5.] <br/><br/>During a <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> fanfest held in London yesterday evening, producer and director Naoki Yoshida seemingly confirmed that the long-running MMO is being prepped for release on Sony's upcoming console, PlayStation 5.<br/><br/><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-ps5-development-confirmed/">According to Wccftech writer Chris Wray</a>, who was in attendance at the event, the news was delivered by Yoshida - a surprise guest - after he took to the stage to hand out raffle prizes. After awarding the top prize of a sleek <i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> branded PS4 console, Yoshida noted that he hoped he would be returning to the event next year, and that his team are currently hard at work on making <i>FF XIV</i> for PlayStation 5 a reality.<br/><br/>There has been no official word from Square Enix concerning this sudden announcement, but as it came straight from the producer's mouth, it seems the <i>FF XIV's</i> PlayStation fans still have years of adventure awaiting them. We will, of course, let you know should any confirmation be forthcoming.<br/><br/><i>Final Fantasy XIV</i> is available on PS4 and PC. An Xbox release <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../phil-spencer-we-will-be-bringing-final-fantasy-xiv-to-xbox--572561.phtml">is expected at some point in the future.</a></p>
