      <h1>Marie Kondo’s shop is a reminder of Japan’s love of stuff</h1>
      <h2>Here is a nation in permanent logistical war with its own tide of clutter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:00:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Leo Lewis</a></address>
      <p>It is not yet December and I’ve already got Christmas sorted. My son gets a crumb brush (windmill palm bark, $24), his sister an earthsaver ridged soap rest (hinoki wood, $16) and dad a flower bouquet tote (raw denim, $42). My wife will undoubtedly purr over her 4,096hz tuning fork (with smoky quartz crystal, $75).</p>
      <p>I know that these items will either be worn out or somewhere at the back of a drawer a year from now, but it’s the giving that counts, and I can already picture their faces: each one a picture of joy sparked by Japan’s minimalist martinet and joy-sparker-in-chief, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8413f9a0-18c0-11e9-9e64-d150b3105d21">Marie Kondo</a>. That’s right: the arch-advocate of decluttering is hawking stuff that seems doomed to become clutter.</p>
      <p>Kondo’s new <a href="https://konmari.com/konmari-shop/">internet shop</a>, which lists the above items among a variety of “did you keep the receipt?” homeware gifts, has only been online for a couple of days and is already causing a stir. Unsurprisingly. Since her bestselling book on scorched earth tidying-up strategies went global five years ago, and was later parlayed into a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4d093f4e-053b-11e9-99df-6183d3002ee1">Netflix series</a>, the softly-spoken Ms Kondo has become a perfect example of how the internet viciously and instantly polarises. She doesn’t really hate books. She cannot force you to get rid of heirlooms.</p>
      <p>Ms Kondo’s fans — and they are legion — are delighted that the guru of tidiness has provided such clear, elegantly designed answers to the question raised by her quirky approach to decluttering. When a home has been denuded the KonMari way, what things would Ms Kondo herself allow back in to inhabit the void? (Balance gem water bottle, $98? Computer brush, $35?).</p>

      <p>Her detractors — and they are also legion but rather less polite — have launched precisely the barrage of scoffing and confected outrage that was predictable from the moment the words “Kondo” and “shop” were juxtaposed. They identify in her homeware collection the kind of dark hypocrisies that blight the world. They condemn the verbal gymnastics with which Ms Kondo has explained how the purist has turned peddler: once you have completed your tidying, “there is room to welcome meaningful objects, people and experiences into your life”, she said.</p>
      <p>The more intriguing aspect of Ms Kondo’s online shop is how it might now change perceptions of the nature of her <a href="https://www.ft.com/topics/places/Japan">Japaneseness</a>. To much of the outside world, her tidiness schtick has seemed like an extension of the culture that produced her — the elusive Japanese way of doing things that keeps its streets so clean, its public transport so punctual and its image so orderly. To her fans at home, she is the epitome of what many would like to think is inherent within the Japanese character — meticulous, spare, tasteful and grateful. To both groups, Ms Kondo, like any good ambassador, has sold an ideal, rather than a reality.</p>

      <p>The truth, of course, is that Japanese homes and offices are often jammed with clutter. Japan’s economy — in large part because of its residual worship of <i>monozukuri</i> (thing-making) and fascination with novelty — exists in an unending frenzy of making, packaging, distributing and accumulating things. Every sales promotion, minor public event or meeting seems to justify the creation and donation of a new thing. Add to this a habit of gift-giving and collection-building that begins in childhood and expands with personal prosperity, sprinkle into limited living space and you have a nation living in permanent logistical war with its own tide of stuff. Households with children are the most vulnerable.</p>
      <p>Ms Kondo, a mother of two, has generally been careful to keep the state of her own home out of the public eye. She has dropped a few hints, however, that it may not differ too much from the Japanese norm, and has described the multiple different scents with which she sprays a small vase of flowers she keeps on her desk (small glass vase, $15) and the 15 different types of tea she keeps in her cupboard (individual tea container, $200). These admissions attest to the way Japan really rolls. It does not detract in the slightest from the power or validity of Ms Kondo’s decluttering mission or message, but it does perhaps puncture the idea that either is especially Japanese. The shop is perhaps her most Japanese work to date.</p>
