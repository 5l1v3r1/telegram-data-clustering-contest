      <p>Shantanu Naidu, a young boy, is proof of how a simple act of love and kindness can change your life. With his unique initiative to save stray dogs, Shantanu earned himself a job from none other than Ratan Tata himself. In a post shared by Humans of Bombay on Wednesday, the story of the boy went viral.</p>
      <p>This young boy witnessed the death of a stray dog one day during his tenure as an employee at the Tata Group in 2014. Shantanu was quite upset as a result of the incident and decided to take a step so as to help prevent such incidents.</p>
      <p>"I knew that I had to do something. So I called a few friends &amp; made a collar with reflectors on it, for drivers to see the dog from afar. The next day, we went &amp; put these collars on stray dogs. I didn't know if it would work, but when I received a message saying that a dog had been saved because of the collar-it felt amazing," he said.</p>
      <p>This noble initiative was applauded by everyone but he did not have any funding to design more collars for bulk orders. That is when his father advised him to write a letter to Ratan Tata "since he loves dogs too", but Shantanu was apprehensive. "I was hesitant, but then I thought, 'Why not?' So I wrote him a handwritten letter &amp; forgot about it," Shantanu added.</p>
      <p>What happened two months later, changed his life. He received a letter from Ratan Tata in return. He said, "Two months later, I received a letter from Mr. Ratan Tata himself! When I opened it, it said that he loved our work &amp; would like to meet me-I couldn't believe it!"</p>
      <p>"A few days later I met him at his office in Mumbai. He told me,'I'm deeply touched by the work you do!' I still get goosebumps thinking about it. He then took me to see his dogs &amp; that's how our friendship began. He also funded our venture! I left for my masters soon, but I promised him that once I finished, I would work for the Tata Trust &amp; he accepted my request."</p>
      <p>And then, this:</p>

      <p>A lot to learn, indeed.</p>
