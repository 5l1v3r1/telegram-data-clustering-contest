      <h1>Review: The Red Shoes at Theatre Royal Plymouth</h1>
      <h2>The drama is rich but there is also fun to be had</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:43:45+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:43</time> by <a rel="author">David Marston</a></address>
      <p>It was only three years ago this very week that award winning director Matthew Bourne launched this mesmerizing production on the world. That too was in Plymouth, prior to a national and international tour.</p>
      <p>Now it is back, prior to a Christmas season at Saddlers Wells, with Ashley Shaw reprising her role as the emotionally fragile, perfectionist dancer and Royal Ballet legend Adam Cooper (the original swan in Bourne’s Swan Lake) taking on the role of imperious impresario Boris Lemontov. And audience members were on their feet at the end, giving a rousing reception to this revival.</p>
      <p>It is a story of obsession and art and it helps to be familiar with the Han Christian Anderson morality tale of the vain girl whose red dancing shoes won’t let her stop dancing.</p>
      <p>But crucial to this dance version is the iconic 1948 Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger (cor) film of the same name. Bourne follows in their steps, telling a story within a story: A ballet company is staging a ballet of The Red Shoes; the leading lady is injured; a chorus girl takes the role and becomes a star – you know the sort of thing.</p>

      <p>Victoria Page (Shaw) is the talented young dancer who falls in love with a struggling composer. But the dictatorial impresario who leads the company believes there is no room for love and human relationships – they detract from your art.</p>
      <p>Shaw captures perfectly the dilemma of the increasingly fragile young woman who is torn between following her heart or her art.</p>
      <p>The drama is rich but there is also fun to be had with the rest of the dance company as they frolic off duty in Monte Carlo or play out their relationships during back stage scenes.</p>
      <p>The luscious music is from Hollywood golden age composer Bernard Hermann – and high praise is due to designer Lez Brotherston, Bourne’s regular collaborator, who constantly delights the eye with his sets which move seamlessly from front to back stage and or from cheap bedsit to grand salon.</p>
      <p>We have already had the thrill of Bourne’s new Romeo and Juliet this year. Lets hope the wonderful spring of his inspiration is still flowing with ideas for his next project – and that we get the chance to see it first.</p>
