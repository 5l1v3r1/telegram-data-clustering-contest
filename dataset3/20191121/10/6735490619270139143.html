      <p>He shared, “I wouldn’t because I don’t want to do a TV show. I wouldn’t choose one so I can’t answer that.</p>
      <p>“I have a whole list of things that I’m excited about and none of those are franchises.”</p>
      <p>Boseman, who has been busy promoting his latest flick “21 Bridges”, also spoke about “Black Panther 2”, which is expected to hit theatres May 2022.</p>

      <p>He said of what fans can expect from the sequel, “Hopefully we can maintain the foundation that we set and build upon it and expand and explore.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I hope, but I think first you need to maintain the foundation. We built a culture and a world and so you have to make sure that you keep that in place.”</p>
