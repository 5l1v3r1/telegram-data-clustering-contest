      <h1>MUFG likely to turn down SoftBank loan over WeWork</h1>
      <h2>Masayoshi Son seeks ¥300bn facility but faces resistance from Japan’s biggest bank</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:20:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:20</time> by <a rel="author">Kana Inagaki, Leo Lewis</a></address>
      <p>Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan’s biggest bank, is likely to withhold additional loans to finance SoftBank’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7fb9ffb2-f53d-11e9-b018-3ef8794b17c6">$9.5bn rescue package</a> for lossmaking office-sharing group WeWork, according to people with knowledge of the discussions. </p>
      <p>SoftBank has asked Japan’s three megabanks — MUFG, Mizuho Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group — for about ¥300bn ($2.8bn) in loans.</p>
      <p>The group is typically a big borrower from Japanese banks for an array of purposes but it has an especially big financing need as it aims to revive WeWork and recoup losses from its $10bn-plus bet on the US property group. </p>
      <p>But MUFG may turn the request down, according to one of the people, if the loans are to be used to save WeWork — a bailout package which involves $5bn of new debt, injecting $1.5bn in previously promised equity and an offer to buy up to $3bn of existing WeWork shares. </p>
      <p>People close to SMFG said that the bank also did not want to lend to the WeWork bailout, but acknowledged that it had no real control over how SoftBank used any corporate loans once they had been extended. </p>
      <p>Analysts say the cautious stance could signal a turning point in the close relationship between Japanese banks and SoftBank’s deal-driven founder Masayoshi Son. </p>
      <p>SoftBank, armed with its<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/25f76710-fbde-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229"> $100bn investment fund</a>, is now one of the most lucrative fee payers for the banking industry. </p>
      <blockquote><b>$6.4bn<br/></b><br/>SoftBank’s most recent net quarterly loss</blockquote>
      <p>But some financial groups, particularly its main bank Mizuho, have become heavily exposed to SoftBank’s fate. </p>
      <p>In recent weeks, investors in Mizuho have privately expressed concerns over the bank’s level of exposure to SoftBank. </p>
      <p>SoftBank recently reported a net quarterly loss of $6.4bn after it <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3694a074-0061-11ea-b7bc-f3fa4e77dd47">wrote down</a> the value of its largest investments including WeWork and ride-hailing group Uber. </p>
      <p>Since the valuation issues at WeWork, there has been “a definite change in mood” among the Japanese banks and doubts have emerged over some parts of SoftBank’s investment strategy, said a banker close to SoftBank. </p>

      <p>The Japanese group poured more than $10bn into WeWork, but governance concerns and questions about its business model killed WeWork’s hopes for an initial public offering and sank its valuation from $47bn in January to $8bn. </p>
      <p>One person close to the talks said the loans were part of SoftBank’s regular financing, but others said its request for loans was specifically related to WeWork’s rescue package. </p>
      <p>With $19bn in cash, the Japanese group does not face an immediate need to seek loans for the $9.5bn bailout. Still, SoftBank said bank loans were one of its options and added no decision had been made. </p>
      <p>MUFG, Mizuho and SMFG declined to comment. </p>
      <p>Shares in SoftBank fell 1.6 per cent on Thursday after the Nikkei newspaper first reported on the financing talks.</p>
