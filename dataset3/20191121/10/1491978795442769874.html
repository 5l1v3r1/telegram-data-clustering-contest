        <i>British group delay tour to support new album Everyday Life as they work towards developing carbon-neutral concerts</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay">Coldplay</a> have pledged to make any tour in support of their new album “actively beneficial” to the environment.</p>
      <p>Frontman Chris Martin <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">told BBC News</a> that the British group was waiting to tour their new album, Everyday Life, so they can ensure such a tour is carbon neutral. “Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” said Martin. “We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral. We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much taking as giving?”</p>
      <p>Coldplay are the latest musical act to address the impact of touring on the environment. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> has announced plans to make her world tour “as green as possible” by banning plastic straws, encouraging fans to bring refillable water bottles and providing comprehensive recycling facilities.</p>
      <p>Every venue on the tour, commencing next March, will feature the “Billie Eilish Eco-Village”, where fans can learn about their role in the climate crisis. Those who pledge to fight <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/21/oxford-dictionaries-declares-climate-emergency-the-word-of-2019">the climate emergency</a> with the organisation Global Citizen can earn free tickets to the sold-out shows.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-1975">The 1975</a> are working towards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/25/time-to-rebel-greta-thunberg-makes-musical-debut-on-the-1975-track">making their tours carbon-efficient</a> and have <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieoborne/status/1172437099498180608">pledged to plant a tree</a> for every ticket sold to their UK arena tour in February. The British band have also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Rm2qXB89l/">stopped producing new </a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Rm2qXB89l/">T-shirts</a>, instead screen-printing a new design over old merchandise stock.</p>
      <p>Emma Banks, co-founder of leading tour agents Creative Artists Agency, questioned the need for musicians to tour at a scale that might require dozens of trucks to transport equipment. “While I certainly don’t want to be putting anybody out of business, I think we have to start being realistic and going, ‘OK, let’s just dial it down a bit,’” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-50485444">she told the BBC</a>.</p>
      <p>Music festivals are also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/23/green-music-festivals-eco-environment">facing </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/23/green-music-festivals-eco-environment">pressure to go green</a>. This year, Glastonbury banned the sale of single-use plastic bottles across its site, offering 850 water taps and dozens of water kiosks. More than 60 major festivals, including Reading, Leeds and Download, have pledged to go plastic-free by 2021.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/coldplay">Coldplay</a> will play two shows in Jordan on 22 November, on the day their album is released, which will be streamed live. On 25 November, they play a one-off concert at the Natural History Museum in London, with all proceeds going to environmental law charity ClientEarth.</p>
