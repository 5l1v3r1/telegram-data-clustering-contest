      <p>Wyoming authorities have ordered rapper <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> to stop ongoing construction on one of his ranches.</p>
      <p>Park County Wyoming Planner Joy Hill told TMZ that the county has instructed West to stop building on his property because his construction permit has not been approved.</p>
      <p>West had submitted an application to build a 70,684-square-foot amphitheatre on his property. The “Jesus Is King” rapper allegedly began construction after submitting his permit without waiting for approval.  According to reports, county officials visited the site and told Kanye’s team to stop construction. Follow-up visits allegedly show that West and his crew ignored the officials’ requests and kept working.</p>
      <p>West reportedly told the Park County Planning and Zoning Commission that the area would be used as a meditation space and the commission was set to make a decision regarding his permit on Tuesday. However, West decided to change the purpose of the structure to residential use hours before the meeting.</p>
      <p>West had purchased <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/kanye-west-buys-14-million-wyoming-ranch/">the Monster Lake Ranch in Cody, Wyoming for $14 million</a> in September. And in November, he bought another $14 million property, the Bighorn Mountain Ranch.</p>
