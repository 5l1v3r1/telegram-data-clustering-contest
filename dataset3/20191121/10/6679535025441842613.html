      <p>The committee’s other members include former defence minister and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, according to a notification issued by Parliamentary Affairs Ministry. Also in the list is <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bjp-mp-pragya-thakur-nominated-to-parliamentary-consultative-committee-on-defence/article30035659.ece">controversial BJP MP Pragya Thakur</a>, whose <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pragyas-appointment-parliamentary-committee-on-defence-unfortunate-for-the-country-congress/article30035975.ece">inclusion has been slammed by the Congress party</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr. Abdullah was detained on August 5, hours before the Union government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into two union territories.</p>
      <p>His son and former Chief Minister <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/omar-abdullah-mehbooba-mufti-placed-under-house-arrest-section-144-imposed-in-srinagar/article28816384.ece">Omar Abdullah and another ex-chief minister Mehbooba mufti </a>were also detained along with more than 5,000 others across the state.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/farooq-abdullah-detained-under-public-safety-act-for-12-days/article29429439.ece">Mr. Abdullah was slapped with the stringent PSA</a> on September 17 on the eve of a Supreme Court hearing on a <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/vaiko-moves-sc-to-produce-farooq-abdullah-in-court-and-set-him-free/article29392304.ece">habeas corpus pertaining to his detention filed by MDMK leader Vaiko</a>.</p>
      <p>The National Conference chief and three-term chief minister has been booked under the ‘public order’ provision of the PSA under which a person can be kept in jail from three-six months without a trial.</p>
      <p>Mr. Abdullah, the PSA order stated, “has tremendous potential for creating an environment of public disorder within the district (Srinagar) and other parts of the Valley“.</p>
      <p>It also accuses him of being a person seen as fanning the emotions of general masses against the country.</p>
