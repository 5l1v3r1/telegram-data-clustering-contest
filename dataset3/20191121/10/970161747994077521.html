      <p>It’s sometimes worth thinking about just how lucky we are to live in a relatively calm and peaceful corner of the universe.</p>
      <p>Now scientists have shown just how hostile the cosmos can be after spotting the most powerful explosion ever recorded.</p>
      <p>Astronomers at the European Space Agency spotted a huge ‘gamma-ray burst’ in January this year.</p>
      <p>These gigantic outbursts spew out more energy than any natural process in the universe, but their origins are mysterious.</p>
      <p>The mega-booms emit lethal ‘gamma rays’ as well as a huge burst of light.</p>
      <p>They produce so much energy that the only source could be a collapsing star which ejects material at 99.999% the speed of light.</p>
      <p>This material then shoots through the gas that surrounds the star, causing a shock that creates a gamma-ray burst.</p>
      <p>The burst spotted in January was named GRB 190114C and took place in a galaxy that’s 5 billion light-years from Earth.</p>

      <p>A team from the European Space Agency used the Hubble Telescope to observe the gamma-ray burst.</p>
      <p>‘Hubble’s observations suggest that this particular burst was sitting in a very dense environment, right in the middle of a bright galaxy 5 billion light-years away,’ explained Andrew Levan of the Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics &amp; Particle Physics Department of Astrophysics at Radboud University in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>‘This is really unusual, and suggests that might be why it produced this exceptionally powerful light.’</p>
      <p>It’s believed the burst took place in a ‘nuclear region’ of a massive galaxy, which is its centre and ‘a location that is rather unique’.</p>
      <p>This means the environment is denser than usual and could explain why the explosion was so powerful.</p>
      <p>‘Scientists have been trying to observe very-high-energy emission from gamma-ray bursts for a long time,’ said Antonio de Ugarte Postigo of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía in Spain.</p>
      <p>‘This new observation is a vital step forward in our understanding of gamma-ray bursts, their immediate surroundings, and just how matter behaves when it is moving at 99.999% of the speed of light.’</p>
