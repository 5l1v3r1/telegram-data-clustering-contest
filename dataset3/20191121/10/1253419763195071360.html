      <h1>Four player co-op action/horror FPS, GTFO, will be coming soon to Steam Early Access</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:38:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>10 Chambers Collective has announced that its 4 player co-op action/horror FPS, GTFO, will be coming soon to Steam Early Access. Although there isn’t any release date yet, the team hopes to release the game in Early Access later this year. Moreover, the team aims to regularly update the game with new levels that will replace the previous ones.</p>
      <p>GTFO is a 4-player co-op action/horror FPS game that targets hardcore gamers looking for a true challenge. To survive down in the terrifying underground Complex where the game takes place, your team needs to communicate and coordinate. Ammunition will be scarce in this game, therefore you’d rather try to go stealth than fire your weapons.</p>
      <p>You play as scavengers held captive by an entity called “The Warden”. The Warden will task your team with a work order that includes different objectives to carry out inside the Complex. This work order is represented by The Rundown, which is the menu you are presented with when you launch GTFO. The Rundown is divided into different tiers; the deeper you go into the Complex, the harder the expeditions get.</p>
      <p>Simon Viklund, member of 10 Chambers Collective and narrator of the explaining video, said:</p>
      <blockquote>“Each work order in the Rundown represents an expedition into a different part of the Complex where the environment, the population of monsters, the objective, and other conditions can all be vastly different and offer diverse gaming experiences”.</blockquote>
      <p>What makes The Rundown a unique and exciting concept, is the countdown timer. When time runs out, the Rundown and its objectives get replaced by new ones. The previous Rundown is wiped and won’t be playable anymore. By using this system, 10 Chambers Collective are able to keep GTFO dynamic while also compelling the game’s community to focus on a common set of expeditions. Gamers will be always able to come back to GTFO for fresh new challenges that they can take on with their friends.</p>
      <p>GTFO is using the Unity game engine and will come out as Early Access on Steam hopefully in 2019. Before that, the team will run an Early Access Beta test of the game. In this beta phase, anyone will be able to join by signing up as an Ambassador at the game’s <a href="http://www.gtfothegame.com/">official website</a>.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
