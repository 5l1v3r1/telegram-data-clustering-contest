      <p>It is, without doubt, a genre-defining game. Let’s rinse it for all its worth.<br/><br/>GTA 5 is an outlier. Everyone’s played it, and everyone knows what Grand Theft Auto is. It’s one of a small handful of games that transcends the gaming hobby to enter mainstream consciousness. It’s a true phenomenon. And above all, it’s a fantastic game.</p>
      <p>GTA 5 is effectively two different games. The single-player campaign of GTA 5 which follows the misadventures of Trevor, Michael and Franklin as they pursue a last-ditch criminal career in Los Santos. And GTA Online, a sprawling, ever-growing online multiplayer criminal simulation, where players can spend their time doing anything from sticking up a local liquor store to running a city-wide criminal empire. If you’re looking for help with multiplayer madness, we have you covered with this extensive <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/10/11/gta-5-online-guide-tips-cheats-mods-heists/">GTA Online guide</a>.</p>
      <p>This page? This page right here is about making the most of <b>GTA 5 cheats</b> to ensure the single-player fun continues well after our three boys have retired, and you’re looking for more ways to escalate the carnage across Los Santos and Blaine County.</p>

      <h3>How to use GTA 5 cheats</h3>
      <p>It’s easy enough using these cheats on your console of choice or PC. For Xbox One, PS4, Xbox 360 or PS3, just tap the relevant buttons. You can also press up on the d-pad to bring up your character’s cell phone, then enter the cell phone cheat and it will have the same effect. On PC you just need to bring up the command/tilde button (~) and enter the cheat from there.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Weapon and ammo cheats</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first set of codes to get your hands on all relate to weapons and making the player a completely lethal killing machine.</p>
      <h4>Spawn all weapons</h4>
      <p>This is the biggie. Enter this cheat and you’ll spawn all weapons and max out the ammo for each one. That means you’ll have pockets crammed with everything from the basic pistols to the grenade launcher and everything in between. It’s a box of lethal toys for you to play with – just be careful not to accidentally blow yourself up.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b>TRIANGLE, R2, LEFT, L1, X, RIGHT, TRIANGLE, DOWN, SQUARE, L1, L1, L1</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> Y, RT, LEFT, LB, A, RIGHT, Y, Down, X, LB, LB, LB</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> TOOLUP</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-8665-87</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Invincibility</h4>
      <p>Unleash violent chaos in GTA 5 and you’ll soon have the cops, the local gangs, gun nuts and general populace returning fire. Not a lot of people back down in Los Santos. So with this cheat you’ll make yourself invincible. You will not die. That doesn’t mean the locals won’t stop throwing bullets at you, so expect the chaos to continue until you manage to shake them off. Or kill them all.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> RIGHT, X, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, R1, RIGHT, LEFT, X, TRIANGLE</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> RIGHT, A, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, RB, RIGHT, LEFT, A, Y</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> PAINKILLER</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-724-654-5537</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Max out health and armour</h4>
      <p>If you don’t want to be completely invincible but do want to keep your ticker pumping, this is the cheat for you. So much quicker and easier than using first aid or eating snacks from a vending machine, this cheat will pump your health back up to maximum and equip you with the highest form of body armour. Now you’re feeling tip-top again, you can jump back in to the action.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> CIRCLE, L1, TRIANGLE, R2, X, SQUARE, CIRCLE, RIGHT, SQUARE, L1, L1, L1</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> B, LB, Y, RT, A, X, B, RIGHT, X, LB, LB, LB</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> TURTLE</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-887-853</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Recharge special ability</h4>
      <p>This is another cheat that gives you a boost without making you super-powered. You might want to use this during the main campaign for that little uplift. It basically recharges your characters special ability. For Franklin that means <b>Driving Focus</b>, so he can slow down time when handling any vehicle with wheels, allowing pinpoint accuracy when racing around the streets. Michael’s special ability is <b>Bullet Time</b>. He can slow down time to target heads and other hotspots with complete accuracy – although he can only do this on foot. Trevor’s special ability is <b>Red Mist</b>. Red Mist allows Trevor to take less damage and inflict more pain when he’s in the zone, so he can be a little more wild and less cautious of the damage he might take.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PS4 / PS3: X, X, Square, R1, L1, X, Right, Left, X</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360</b>: A, A, X, RB, LB, A, Right, Left, A</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> POWERUP</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-769-3787</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Raise Wanted level</h4>
      <p>If you really want to taunt the police and you can’t be bothered to start the antagonism from scratch, this cheat will max out your wanted level immediately. That means you’ll be descended upon by special military police in helicopters and tanks and with van-loads of support. Brace yourself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> R1, R1, CIRCLE, R2, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> RB, RB, B, RT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> FUGITIVE</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-3844-8483</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Lower Wanted Level</h4>
      <p>Okay, so you need to take it down and notch and you just can’t shake those relentless cops? You need to lower your wanted level by entering this cheat. Each time you enter it you lower your wanted level by one star.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> R1, R1, CIRCLE, R2, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> – RB, RB, B, RT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> LAWYERUP</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> – 1-999-529-93787</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Explosive rounds</h4>
      <p>When normal bullets just won’t kill quick enough, you need explosive bullets. These are great for taking out heavily armoured targets and for dropping enemies with a single shot. Especially useful when going up against the police or military because those guys do not mess around.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> RIGHT, SQUARE, X, LEFT, R1, R2, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, L1, L1, L1</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> RIGHT, X, A, LEFT, RB, RT, LEFT, RIGHT, RIGHT, LB, LB, LB</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> HIGHEX</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-444-439</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Flame rounds</h4>
      <p>Flame rounds do more damage long term because after the initial hit they continue to do burn damage to your enemies, so they really are an effective way to win the fight.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> L1, R1, SQUARE, R1, LEFT, R2, R1, LEFT, SQUARE, RIGHT, L1, L1</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> LB, RB, X, RB, LEFT, RT, RB, LEFT, X, RIGHT, LB, LB</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> INCENDIARY</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-462-363-4279</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Explosive melee</h4>
      <p>This cheat is pure comedy. Enter it and you’ll win pretty much any fist fight with a flick of the wrist and an explosive punch. Pow, indeed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> RIGHT, LEFT, X, TRIANGLE, R1, CIRCLE, CIRCLE, CIRCLE, L2</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> RIGHT, LEFT, A, Y, RB, B, B, B, LT</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> HOTHANDS</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-4684-2637</li>
      </ul>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://assets.vg247.com/current//2015/08/gta_5.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Slow down aim</h4>
      <p>This is similar to Michael’s special ability in that it gives you a bullet time cheat but can be applied to any of the three characters. You can enter it up to four times, with each entry slowing down time further. The fifth time you enter it you’ll return to normal time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> SQUARE, L2, R1, TRIANGLE, LEFT, SQUARE, L2, RIGHT, X</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> X, LT, RB, Y, LEFT, X, LT, RIGHT, A</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> DEADEYE</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-332-3393</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to spawn all vehicles in GTA 5</h3>
      <p>Grand Theft Auto 5 is all about the vehicles. It has it all; sports cars, off-road, novelty rides, bikes, dad cars, helicopters, jet planes and a whole lot more. It even has a submarine. So when the main game is over and you want to explore, race or just mess about doing donuts, these are the vehicles for you.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Duke O’ Death</h4>
      <p>Probably the most fun you can have on four wheels in GTA 5. This badboy is bullet proof, sounds like farts in Hell, and punches other vehicles off the freeway. You’ll never go back to another muscle car. As this was added post-release, you can only spawn this using the in-game phone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 /PS3:</b> Dial 1-999-332-84227</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> Dial 1-999-332-84227</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> DEATHCAR</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-332-84227</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Kraken submarine</h4>
      <p>The Kraken is handy for exploring underwater and finding hidden treasure amongst the depths. Note that you have to spawn this on console using the phone, there isn’t a regular cheat code for it.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> Dial 1-999-282-2537</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360:</b> Dial 1-999-282-2537</li>
        <li><b>PC:</b> BUBBLES</li>
        <li><b>Cell Phone:</b> 1-999-282-2537</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Dodo sea plane</h4>
      <p>Boats are generally a bit rubbish in GTA 5, so we prefer to use the Dodo as you can fly to any mission that requires water and land close by. On console you’ll need to enter this cheat via the phone by pressing up on the d-pad.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3</b> Dial 1-999-398-4628</li>
        <li><b>Xbox One / Xbox 360</b> Dial 1-999-398-4628</li>

      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> R2, L1, Circle, Right, L1, R1, Right, Left, Circle, R2</li>

        <li><b>PC:</b> RAPIDGT</li>
        <li>Cell Phone: 1-999-727-4348</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Spawn Comet</h4>
      <p>Another popular racer, it handles well and is ideal for a quick getaway if the five-0 are on your ass.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>PS4 / PS3:</b> R1, Circle, R2, Right, L1, L2, X, X, Square, R1</li>
        <li>Xbox One / Xbox 360: RB, B, RT, Right, LB, LT, A, A, X, RB</li>
