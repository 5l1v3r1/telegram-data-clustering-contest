      <p>AirPods will be one of the most popular items of <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-friday/">Black Friday 2019</a>. We're calling it now.</p>
      <p>Go type "AirPods" into Google Trends and check out the related queries. Searches like "Black Friday AirPods" and "AirPods Black Friday sale" have risen by <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=airpods">700% from October to November</a> and over <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=airpods">100% in the last seven days</a>. </p>
      <p>This leads up to one question: Who will have the best price on AirPods for Black Friday 2019?</p>
      <p>
        <b>As of now, </b>
        <a href="https://zdcs.link/q2Alw">
          <b>Walmart wins for the more affordable AirPods 2</b>
        </a>
        <b> and </b>
        <a href="https://zdcs.link/2kjLD">
          <b>Amazon wins for the new AirPods Pro</b>
        </a>
        <b>. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The front page of <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/ads/walmart-black-friday#ad_view">Walmart's Black Friday ad</a> flexes the <a href="https://zdcs.link/q2Alw">second-generation AirPods</a> with the regular (not wireless) charging case for $129, which is the lowest we've seen during our scouring of <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/black-friday-2019-ad-scans-best-deals/">all the major Black Friday 2019 ad scans</a>. $129 is $30 off the original price and $10 less than this model's lowest price on Amazon ever.</p>
      <p>Amazon doesn't drop a traditional ad scan, but in typical Amazon fashion, it has sneakily dropped the <a href="https://zdcs.link/2kjLD">AirPods Pro</a> to $234.98 weeks ahead of Black Friday. A $14 discount doesn't seem like much until you consider that Amazon is currently the only major retailer we've seen with any sort of AirPods Pro discount. Amazon is no stranger to unprecedented discounts on Apple devices, so a surprise Black Friday sale on the AirPods 2 or AirPods Pro could be on the horizon.</p>
      <p>What's the difference between AirPods and AirPods Pro? The steep change in price can be attributed to the addition of noise cancellation and water resistance in the AirPods Pro. If you're wondering if that's worth the extra $100, <a href="https://mashable.com/review/airpods-pro-review/">it definitely is</a>.</p>
