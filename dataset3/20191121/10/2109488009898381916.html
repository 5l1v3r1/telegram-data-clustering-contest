      <p>America Movil chairman Carlos Slim Domit (<i>pictured</i>) revealed the company would invest BRL30 billion ($7.2 billion) to increase the scope of its offering in Brazil, <i>Bloomberg</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Speaking after a meeting with the country’s president Jair Bolsonaro, Slim Domit said the cash injection would allow the company to increase infrastructure capacity and grow across various segments, including a push into cloud services.</p>
      <p>The cash covers increased spend to improve current services and launch of new ones.</p>
      <p>America Movil operates the Claro mobile brand in Brazil which, according to GSMA Intelligence estimates for Q3, is the second largest operator in the country with 56.6 million connections.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the operator group announced it was in the <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/america-movil-strikes-nextel-brazil-deal/">process of acquiring</a> much smaller market rival Nextel for $905 million and has also been <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/america-movil-denies-interest-in-oi/">linked numerous times</a> with a purchase of assets from troubled operator Oi. Rumours have covered both bids for Oi’s whole operation and a deal where assets are divided between a number of interested parties.</p>
      <p>In addition to mobile services, America Movil’s Brazil division provides fixed line, PayTV and related services.</p>
