      <h1>General Election 2019: Conservatives go head-to-head with Labour on housing</h1>

      <p>The Conservatives are hoping to take Labour head-on with a series of pledges designed to tackle the housing crisis.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn will today unveil a flagship policy that includes plans 100,000 council homes a year by the end of the five-year term, an increase of more than 3,500 per cent.</p>

      <p>On top of this Labour will pledge to build at least 50,000 "genuinely affordable" homes each year, and at least 150,000 new council and social homes a year within five years. The party claims this is the biggest council housebuilding programme the Second World War, and the biggest overall affordable housebuilding programme since the 1960s.</p>
      <p>Looking to neuter this, the Tories will also announce a number of policies alongside their million homes pledge, which includes an overhaul of the planning system.</p>
      <p>Conservatives say they would not use public money to build the houses, instead using policies designed to encourage the private sector to build more.</p>
      <p>But one eye-catching pledge will see a Boris Johnson government introduce a new mortgage with long-term fixed rates, with only a five per cent deposit, to help renters buy their first homes.</p>
      <p>The Tories will also create a scheme where local first-time buyers will be able to get a 30 per cent discount on new homes in their area.</p>
      <p>Plans to tinker with the mortgage market has raised eyebrows among some commentators.</p>
      <p>Torsten Bell, chief executive of Resolution Foundation, said: "It's a massive deal if they're overruling the Bank of England on regulation OR getting on the nationalisation bandwagon with state-backed mortgages."</p>
      <p>He pointed to "the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac joys" during the sub-prime mortgage collapse in the US.</p>
