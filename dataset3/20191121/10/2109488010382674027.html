      <h1>FCC unveils C-V2X frequency proposal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:23:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#yanitsaboyadzhieva" target="_blank">Yanitsa Boyadzhieva</a></address>
      <p>The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Ajit Pai announced a proposal to open the 5.9 GHz band for Wi-Fi and automotive communications technology, with a decision to be made by the regulator on 12 December.</p>
      <p>Pai suggested the lower 45 MHz of the band be made available for unlicensed uses like Wi-Fi and the upper 20 MHz to be allocated for Cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X).</p>
      <p>The FCC chairman also appealed for public input on whether to allocate the remaining 10 MHz of the spectrum for Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) or C-V2X.</p>
      <p>Pai argued the expansion of C-V2X should be encouraged, as the technology would provide direct communications between vehicles and “everything”, including other vehicles on the road, infrastructure, cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
      <p>“Our hope is that this move will unlock new vehicle safety services, using less spectrum and on a much faster timeline than we have seen or realistically could see with a DSRC-focused policy”, he said, reassuring the FCC is committed to transportation safety.</p>
      <p>He also called for resisting “the notion that we have to choose between automotive safety and Wi-Fi”, as his proposal “would do far more for both automotive safety and Wi-Fi than the status quo”.</p>
