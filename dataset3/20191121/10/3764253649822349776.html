      <p>The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has successfully completed clinical trials of the world’s first injectable male contraceptive, and it has been sent to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for approval.</p>
      <p>According to Hindustantimes, if the birth control pill is finally approved, when injected it would be effective for 13 years in the carrier.</p>
      <p>The same media also reports that injection is an alternative to the only form of male birth control which is surgical vasectomy.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the ICMR is the final body in India that oversees biomedical research and gets its funding from the government at the union ministry of health.</p>

      <p>HT reports that 53.5% of Indian couples use birth spacing methods, out of permanent sterilization is the most popular.</p>
      <p>Doctors in the country are of the opinion that injectable male contraceptives will be most demanded-for than surgical vasectomy as Dr Anup Kumar said men will opt for it.</p>
      <p><i>“Non-surgical procedures are always preferred over surgical procedures because they will be safer and less invasive. More men are likely to opt for it,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p>There are, however, a challenge in the face of the drug once it gets approval; the government will need to publicise it for it to gain wide acceptability.</p>
      <p>AR Nanda, a former family welfare secretary is one of the above opinion, adding that incentives for people who go for the option is also necessary.</p>

      <p><i>“Two things are needed from the government for it to work; one is to make use of the trial subjects for awareness generation among masses about the product, and second is to offer higher incentives for people opting for male contraceptives,”</i> Nanda said.</p>
