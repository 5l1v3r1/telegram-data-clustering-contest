      <h1>Room For Repo Rate Cut, According To Some Economists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:50:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.iafrica.com/author/neelket/" target="_blank">NT Editor</a></address>
      <p>With inflation at its lowest rate in eight years, some economists argue there is room for the South African Reserve Bank (Sarb) to lower the repo rate on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Stats SA announced that the headline consumer price index fell to 3.7% in October, down from 4.1% the month before.</p>
      <p>The monetary policy committee decided to keep the rate unchanged at its last meeting citing factors that could influence inflation.</p>
      <p>Inflation has continued its downward move with consumer spending also subdued.</p>
      <p>Independent economist Richard Downing said: “In terms of interest rates, I think there is some room at the moment because real interests will be affected by lower inflation.”</p>
      <p>Economist Thabi Leoka said while there may be good news for those with debt, not all South Africans will benefit if the repo rate decreases.</p>
      <p>“So, for the majority of South Africans, a rate cut may not have a significant impact.”</p>
      <p>With the festive season fast approaching, there may be good news on Thursday afternoon for many cash-strapped South Africans, although those with savings may not agree.</p>
