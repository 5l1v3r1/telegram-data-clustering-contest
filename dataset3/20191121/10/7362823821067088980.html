      <h1>Kissinger, in Beijing, warns US-China trade war could spark conflict worse than WWI</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:27:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Danielle Wallace</a></address>
      <p>Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told an audience in Beijing on Thursday that <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/china">China</a> and the United States are in the “foothills of a Cold War,” warning that the current <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/global-economy/trade">trade war</a> <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-trade-deal-with-china-could-happen-soon-but-only-if-good-for-us">between the two nations</a> could escalate into an armed conflict worse than World War I if left unresolved.</p>
      <p>Kissinger, who as President Nixon’s secretary of state flew to Beijing to begin trade talks with Communist China in 1971, gave his take on modern U.S.-Chinese relations at the Bloomberg New Economy Forum.</p>

      <p>"If conflict is permitted to run unconstrained, the outcome could be even worse than it was in Europe," Kissinger said. "World War I broke out because of a relatively minor crisis ... and today the weapons are more powerful."</p>

      <p>“That makes it, in my view, especially important that a period of relative tension be followed by an explicit effort to understand what the political causes are and a commitment by both sides to try to overcome those,” Kissinger continued, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/kissinger-says-u-s-and-china-in-foothills-of-a-cold-war">Bloomberg</a>. “It is far from being too late for that, because we are still in the foothills of a Cold War.”</p>
      <p>China has taken issue with Washington over Congress’ recent passage of a bill aimed at protecting human rights in Hong Kong amid an escalating pro-democracy movement in the semiautonomous Chinese city. The U.S. has criticized the detention of Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region, and both nations remain locked in a contentious strategic competition in the South China Sea.</p>
      <p>Kissinger, 96, made the remarks as the U.S. and China struggle to reach a trade agreement. President Trump began imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese exports nearly 18 months ago, citing trade and technology policies that he says violate Beijing’s market-opening commitments and are unfair. Since then, tariffs have been raised by both sides on billions of dollars’ worth of each other’s exports, squeezing farmers and manufacturers. A fresh set of tariffs is due to take effect Dec. 15 on about $160 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S., including smartphones, laptops and other consumer goods.</p>
      <p>“Everybody knows that trade negotiations, which I hope will succeed and whose success I support, can only be a small beginning to a political discussion that I hope will take place,” Kissinger added.</p>
      <p>Trump had said he hoped to sign a preliminary agreement with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at a regional economic summit in Chile in mid-November that was canceled due to protests. Prospects for the two leaders to meet and sign a deal soon appear uncertain.</p>

      <p>Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan delivered a speech at the start of the forum, calling for better relations between the two world powers.</p>
      <p>“Between war and peace, the Chinese people firmly choose peace. Humanity cherishes peace,” he said. “We should abandon the zero-sum thinking and cold war mentality.”</p>
