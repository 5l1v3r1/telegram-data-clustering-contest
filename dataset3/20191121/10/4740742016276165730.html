      <p>Hamer joined the Gas in February 2016, being installed after the al-Qadi family took charge of the club, after previously having a three-year stint as chairman of Swansea City between 1997 and 2000.</p>
      <p>The 68-year-old was at Rovers' FA Cup replay victory over Bromley on Tuesday evening but has been out of the spotlight over the last 12 months, with CEO Martyn Starnes taking a more prominent role after being appointed in March 2018.</p>
      <p>Rovers' statement is notable in its shortness, with just 15 words being dedicated to the man who has been at the Gas for over three years.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/news/2019/november/chairman-statement/">It said:</a> "The club has parted company with the non-executive chairman, Steve Hamer, with immediate effect."</p>
