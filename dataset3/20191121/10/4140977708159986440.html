                <h3>On not playing day-night match during Australia tour</h3>
                <p>During their tour of Australia last year, India refused to play a day-night match in Adelaide. While many reasons were speculated behind the same, Kohli opened up on why the Indian team wanted to play a home Test with the pink ball before playing it in on overseas soil.</p>

                      <p>“It [day-night Test] had to happen eventually. The thing was to experience the pink ball test in our own conditions first so you get a hang of how the ball behaves. Then eventually going on and playing pink ball Test anywhere in the world.</p>

                          <p>“It can’t be a sudden thing. A few guys practiced even before the series started. You can’t two before we get on to a plane say that we are going to play a pink-ball Test in a week’s time. We didn’t think it was logical from that point of view,” Kohli said.</p>

                            <h3>Virat Kohli answers if day-night Tests should become future of Test cricket</h3>
                            <p>Being asked about if day-night Tests should be the way forward in Test cricket, Kohli didn’t shy away from speaking against the same. The 31-year old cricketer didn’t aim at playing the format for just “entertainment”.</p>
                            <p>“This can be a one-off thing. It should not, in my opinion, become a regular scenario. You can bring excitement into Test cricket but you can’t purely make Test cricket based on just entertainment. The entertainment of Test cricket lies in a batsman trying to survive a session, a bowler trying to set up a batsman.</p>
                            <p>“If people don’t want to respond to that, too bad. If I don’t like Test cricket, you can’t push me to like it. Those who enjoy the battle between bat and ball and great session of Test cricket, in my opinion, those are the people that should come and watch Test cricket because they understand what’s going on,” Kohli added.</p>
