      <p>Gospel musician Wahu Kagwi was on Thursday arrested and charged for causing obstruction, driving without a valid driving license and dangerous overtaking.</p>
      <p>The businesswoman was apparently driving a Mercedes Benz 440L when the incident occurred. It was around 10.10 am along Ring Road, Kileleshwa.</p>
      <p>Wahu was arraigned at Milimani Law Courts before magistrate Elector Riani where she denied the charges.</p>

      <p>She has since been released on a Sh15,000 cash bail.</p>
      <p>The case will be heard later on in the day.</p>
