      <p>Kaizer Chiefs are a ‘big squad’ with ‘quality players’, and Maritzburg United face a big challenge if they’re going to pip them to a spot in the 2019 Telkom Knockout final.</p>

      <p>The Team of Choice have never made it to the TKO final since their formation, while no team in the country has won it more times than the Glamour Boys, and on Sunday they lock horns as they seek to book their spot at the showpiece in Durban next month.</p>
      <p>Both teams find themselves on a good run of form at present, with Chiefs sitting pretty at the top of the Absa Premiership table and Maritzburg unbeaten in seven games in all competitions – it’s going to be a battle at Mbombela Stadium. </p>
      <p>Nazeer Allie, Eric Tinkler’s captain, says they will play without fear against Ernst Middendorp’s side, telling the club’s official website, “We know it’s going to be tough, Chiefs are on a very good run of form. But we’ll go there with a positive mindset, it can go either way in a cup semi-final… We’ll just prepare well as we do for every game and take that into Sunday’s match. Chiefs are a big squad, they have quality players who can come in and fill the positions. All of them have quality, so we’ll prepare ourselves very well for them.</p>
      <p>“You need to go out there and enjoy it, because if you don’t enjoy it you’ll be playing under stress. You’ve got to take the pressure off, go out there and play without fear, enjoy the game and know it can go either way.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Allie is also looking for his teammates in the side to step up and grab more goals – an area of their game that they’ve been lacking in – calling for everyone to chip in, saying, “The whole squad should take the responsibility of scoring goals… We can’t just look up front, because the guys up front are also assisting, putting other guys in a position to score, so we all have to take responsibility to score goals, it’s the whole team.”</p>
      <p>Maritzburg face Chiefs in Nelspruit on Sunday afternoon at XI.  </p>
