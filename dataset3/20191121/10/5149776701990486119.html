      <p>Sammy Ameobi deserves a new contract at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>, says former Reds caretaker boss Ian McParland.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old winger has played in every Championship match for Forest so far this season, after moving to the City Ground on a one-year deal last summer, helping them to fifth place in the table.</p>
      <p>And while McParland believes <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sammy-ameobi">Ameobi</a> has still not fulfilled his potential, he thinks he should "definitely" be rewarded for his performances with a contract extension.</p>
      <p>"We talk about characters and personalities and you can see right away he's great," McParland told Notts TV.</p>

      <p>"It's good for people to come into the club with a big smile on their face and with a bit of character.</p>
      <p>"I've watched him all through the years and I still don't think he's fulfilled his potential.</p>
      <p>"I think he's got a lot of ability.</p>
      <p>"He needs to add more goals to his game and more assists."</p>
