      <p>Charity Dingle and Vanessa Woodfield have reunited in sweet scenes, but some <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> viewers found them laughable.</p>
      <p>As the ITV soap told fans it was the "reunion we were waiting for", those watching from home pointed out that the couple had only been apart for a matter of days!</p>

      <p>Last week (November 11), <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-heartbroken-as-vanessa-dumps-charity/">Vanessa split up with Charity</a> after realising she couldn't forgive her for her lies.</p>
      <p>Discovering <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-divided-over-mandy-dingle-flashback-episode/">Charity's involvement in the casino scam</a> with Mandy Dingle and the mysterious Vinny, Vanessa gave Charity the opportunity to confess.</p>
      <aside>I'm not so fussed about a couple that have been apart about six days.</aside>
      <p>But, when she lied to her face, Vanessa realised she had no option but to dump her partner.</p>

      <p>However, after a week of moping around and looking sad, the pair came back together in sweet scenes on Wednesday (November 20).</p>
      <p>When Sarah had a scary night throwing up after taking an unidentified pill, Charity called Vanessa over for emotional comfort.</p>
      <p>But Charity pushed her luck when she made a move...</p>

      <p>In later scenes, Charity found Vanessa to apologise for crossing the line, and made another plea for them to get back together.</p>
      <p>Vanessa admitted she still loved Charity, but that she can't cope with the lying.</p>
      <p>When Charity promised to be completely open from now on, Vanessa agreed to give their relationship another go.</p>
      <p>And, just like that, Vanity are a thing again.</p>

      <p>But some fans were quick to mock the scenes, with one tweeting: "I'm not so fussed about a couple that have been apart about six days, I'm more focused on a Robron reunion."</p>
      <p>Another said: "No, we weren't [all waiting for a Charity and Vanessa reunion]. What's the point in breaking them up if they reunite like five minutes later?"</p>
      <p>A third typed: "Wow so powerful, a break-up that lasted two days, for stupid reasons, no consequences for any of them, at least it will stop Charity being boring and nagging so I guess small mercies."</p>
      <p>"A boring reunion for a boring couple in a now boring show. At least you are consistent," slammed one more, while another added: "Hasn't even been a week?"</p>
      <p>Many others hoped for a Robron reunion one day, and others begged for Coira - <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-viewers-divided-as-cain-dingle-throws-wife-moira-out/">Cain and Moira</a> - to reunite, but neither are looking likely any time soon!</p>
