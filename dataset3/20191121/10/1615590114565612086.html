      <h1>Paid subscriptions coming to Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</h1>
      <h2>UPDATE: Nintendo follows Mario Kart subscription with two tiers for Animal Crossing amounting to $10.98 per month</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:10:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/?author=1708" target="_blank">Haydn Taylor</a></address>
      <p><b>Original Story 18/11/19:</b> Nintendo has revealed plans to introduce a two-tier paid subscription model to Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp.</p>
      <p>Released in October 2017, the mobile adaptation of one of Nintendo's flagship franchises has <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-09-30-one-year-in-dragalia-lost-revenue-surpassed-by-pocket-camp-again">grossed around $111 million lifetime revenue</a>.</p>
      <p>However, following the surprise implementation of the subscription model in Mario Kart World Tour, Nintendo has given the greenlight for a similar system for Pocket Camp.</p>
      <p>There is currently no information on the pricing and limited detail on features, but according to an in-game update the two tiers will offer very different perks around admin and storage.</p>
      <p>Nintendo will reveal more details on Wednesday, November 21 when it will release some videos.</p>
      <p>Working with Japanese developer DeNA, Nintendo has released a raft of mobile games over the past three years with varying degrees of success.</p>
      <p>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp has been among the weakest performing along with Dr Mario World, while Fire Emblem Heroes has remained Nintendo's golden child since launch.</p>
      <p><b>Update:</b> Nintendo has now detailed the two subscription plans, which come to a combined $10.98 per month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/1rF1SDjOKTg">$7.99 Cookie and Depot Plan</a> gives subscribers five free fortune cookies -- the mobile game's loot boxes -- per month, plus an expanded inventory.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://youtu.be/ex6120rV24E">$2.99 Happy Helper Plan</a> automates some of the in-game tasks such as collecting event items and completing animal requests, so players won't have to log in as often.</p>
      <p>Our sister site Eurogamer has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-07-31-animal-crossing-pocket-camps-latest-event-left-fans-in-despair">highly critical of Pocket Camp's aggressive monetisation model</a>. Fortunately, the series' next full entry -- Animal Crossing: New Horizons -- arrives on Switch in March.</p>
