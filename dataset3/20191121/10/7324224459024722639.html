      <h2>A ghost tour is taking place at an historic museum in the Black Country, hosted by a paranormal investigation team.</h2>

      <p>Energies &amp; Entities will be holding the tour at the Leather Museum in Littleton Street, Walsall.</p>
      <p>The investigation team will be searching for auras and vibrations inside the 130-year-old building.</p>
      <p>Chris Stone, a medium at Energies and Entities, said: “We were very excited to investigate this landmark site. We recently spent a good three hours at the museum with and picked-up on a lot of different energies and auras.</p>
      <p>"I quickly became aware of a soldier and officer, who I believe fought in the Great War – he wasn’t directly connected with the building, but I got a strong feeling that his leather accessories for his dress uniform, namely a harness, belt, gun holster and boots, were all made on site.</p>
      <p>"I had several colleagues with me that night and all of us greatly enjoyed our investigations, the atmosphere in the building is so warm and friendly. We would love to come back some day to discover more secrets.”</p>
      <p>Catherine Lister, collections officer at Walsall Leather Museum, said: “The Energies &amp; Entities group take their work and research very seriously and we were pleased to be able to give them the opportunity to hire the museum and investigate the old workshops on the first floor.</p>
      <p>"We get a range of requests to use the building, but this was the first time we allowed a paranormal group to do an investigation.</p>
      <p>“As it was ‘out of hours’ booking, I myself supervised the visit - and as a history lover with a great interest in Walsall’s past, I can see exactly why our 130-year-old museum would appeal to them. Whatever your beliefs or interests, it is an atmospheric old building and we cannot know exactly who worked here and what went on.</p>
      <p>"The building was a hive of activity at the height of the town’s leather industry - who knows what stories and secrets could have passed inside these walls?”</p>
