      <h3>Keighley might be besties with Kojima, but he had nothing to do with nominations.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/the-game-awards/">The Game Awards’</a> Geoff Keighley has addressed conflict of interest concerns that have crept up as a result of <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/death-stranding/">Death Stranding</a> </i>being nominated across a number of categories.</p>
      <p>Keighley, who hosts The Game Awards and also <a href="https://stevivor.com/guides/death-stranding-cameos-find/">appears inside <i>Death Stranding </i>as The Ludens Fan</a>, took to Twitter to assert he personally had nothing to do with the awards’ nominations themselves, <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/game-awards-2019-nominees-announced/">which were recently released to the public</a>.</p>
      <p>“I don’t vote on the nominees,” <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1197178114645753860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Keighley wrote</a>, adding, “there is a jury of 80 media that select the nominees!” Keighley noted that <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq">The Game Awards’ FAQ page</a> may also clear up additional concerns.</p>
      <p>As a member of The Game Awards jury, Stevivor can confirm it submitted a list of nominations and will soon vote on winners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/the-game-awards/">The Game Awards</a> will be livestreamed from Los Angeles, California from 12.30pm AEDT on 13 December. <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/death-stranding/">Death Stranding</a> </i>is currently available on PS4 and heads to PC in 2020. How do you feel about the game’s nominations?</p>
