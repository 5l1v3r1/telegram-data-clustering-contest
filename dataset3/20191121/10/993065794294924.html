      <p>In an area that’s currently booming in popularity, number 538 on Belfast’s Antrim Road exudes the kind of inimitable grace and appeal sure to appeal for the decades to come.</p>
      <p>This stunning five bedroom detached residence enjoys a prominent location in this coveted address - perfectly placed to take full advantage of a wealth of amenities including shops, schools, sporting facilities and of course, excellent transport links into the city centre.</p>
      <p>Practicality aside and on an aesthetic note alone, this property boasts the kind of look sure to strike a chord with the daydreamer intent on a period property of their very own that many others will try to emulate but never achieve.</p>

      <p>It has been beautifully maintained by the long term family owners here - even the original doorbell from the 1930s is in place - and the property is almost Tudoresque with its sublime wooden panelled hallway, beamed ceilings, tiles and of course exquisite dining room which almost looks like it was perfectly pinched straight from the set of an Agatha Christie adaptation.</p>
      <p>Here your imagination can truly run wild but as intriguing as this property is, it’s worth nothing that is as every bit as practical and ready for family life and all that it brings.</p>

      <p>It screams quality and attention to detail with various arts and crafts style finishes ready and waiting to be maximised to their full potential. Enjoy beautiful bay windows overlooking lush green spaces, creative fireplaces, original stained glass windows and of course, spacious bedrooms that are a hallmark of the period this property was built. </p>
      <p>The property has bucket loads of potential and it is up to you how much you would like to bring number 538 more firmly into the 21st century. But whatever you choose to do, or not do, the foundations are already in place for a truly one-of-a-kind project. A showpiece home you will be proud to call your own. </p>
      <p>Through to your kitchen where the possibilities are endless including an extension to accommodate an island and Velux windows. It already of course opens onto a small covered courtyard with access to outbuildings and the garage.</p>
      <p>Upstairs the quality and style continues with touches of flair sure to be unearthed at every corner - chandeliers are just one of too many to mention examples. </p>
