      <p>Star Wars actor Anthony Daniels says the people “inside the suits” are finally starting to get the credit they deserve.</p>
      <p>Daniels, 73, said that film bosses originally wanted to “pretend” that C-3PO was a real robot.</p>
      <p>He told BBC Breakfast: “These days, people are better at acknowledging who is doing voiceover, who is doing motion capture, or whatever.</p>

      <p>“Back in the day, they tried to pretend that C-3PO was a real robot and<br/>that was a little difficult to live with.</p>
      <p>“Now it’s perfectly normal to say, ‘Basically I was puppeteering’.”</p>
      <p>Daniels, who will be back in character in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, said he worried about being “locked” in his golden, droid suit when he first took on the role, after “realising that I couldn’t get out if anyone got abducted by aliens”.</p>
      <p>“It would take half an hour to put back on, so they never wanted to take me out of it,” the British actor said.</p>
