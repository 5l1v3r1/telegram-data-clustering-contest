      <p>So, you know since this morning that Arjun Rampal and Mehr Jesia stopped being man and wife yesterday, when the <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/arjun-rampal-and-mehr-jesia-granted-divorce-daughters-to-live-with-their-mother/5dd6085e87fb571eff7e42ec">Family Court granted them divorce.</a> But, bet you didn't know that these two were fed up of each since at least 6 years and had decided to end their 21-year-old shaadi 5 years back. Ji haan, and mind you, they had even met lawyers for the same.<br/><br/>Lekin kisina kisi vajah se they did not take the plunge, ji, marriage end karna bhi toh ek plunge (big decision) hi hai na. They tried in some way or the other to even resurrect their broken relationship- but all in vain. </p>

      <p>The delay was perpetrated by largely Mehr and Arjun's disagreements over alimony.<br/><br/>And now, when they're eventually separated legally- let us tell you that the Chand Terrace flat (where they lived in their happier days) has gone to Mehr; Arjun readily gave it. And yes, the lady has even taken an alimony. The two obviously came to a mutual settlement with an amount that both digested (with a gulp, of course). Arjun is the earning member of the family and both daughters need to grow up comfortably, besides alimony was Mehr's right anyway.</p>

      <p>We also have it that Arjun and Mehr's behaviour at the Family Court was extremely dignified. Neither of the two showed any bad vibes or created a scene. The divorce, in the first place, was filed by mutual consent. The ugly battles and the shouting was all over, after all, 5 years is a long time for a good amount of water to have flown under the bridge.<br/><br/>Mehr is single now, never heard of any link-up at her end. Sources say that she's an extremely headstrong woman who believes that loyalty is the first criterion in marriage.</p>

      <p>On the other hand, Arjun has currently settled down with his girlfriend Gabriella Demetriades. The couple has a 5-month old son, born on July 18, 2019.<br/><i><br/><br/>Image Source:-  ww17/pinterest/kapanlagi/onlinemovie</i></p>
