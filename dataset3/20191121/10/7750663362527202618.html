      <h1>Rory Burns "disappointed" despite half-century in New Zealand</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/cricket/england/"><b>England</b></a> opener <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rory-burns/"><b>Rory Burns</b></a> was pleased he battled to a half-century but admitted his disappointment at not progressing further on the opening day of the first Test against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/cricket/new-zealand/"><b>New Zealand</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Burns rode his luck on a number of occasions to record a streaky 52 as England’s top order followed captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-root/"><b>Joe Root</b></a>’s instruction to adopt a more patient approach in an effort to eliminate the collapses of recent years.</p>
      <p>The Surrey captain was one of three batsmen to go past fifty in Mount Maunganui as England closed on 241 for four, a total swelled by some belligerence from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-denly/"><b>Joe Denly</b></a> (74) and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-stokes/"><b>Ben Stokes</b></a> (67 not out) towards the end of the day.</p>

      <p>Burns said: “I sort of ebbed and flowed. There were bits where I had some rhythm, there were bits where I was scrapping away and couldn’t really find it.</p>
      <p>“It was slightly indifferent but I managed to scrap my way to a score and in the end was probably disappointed that it wasn’t a bigger score than it was.</p>
      <p>“It’s been a good day’s cricket. The way they bowled and the discipline they showed, our run-rate was probably hovering just over two for most of the day until Stokesy got a few away there at the end.</p>
      <p>“They’ve obviously bowled very well but I feel we’ve set up the game in a way where we’re really looking at establishing ourselves in this first innings and trying to get some good runs on the board.”</p>
      <p>Burns edged between first and second slip on 37 and then survived a review for lbw after being rapped on the back pad by Trent Boult, reprieved by ‘Umpire’s Call’ on height alone.</p>

      <p>He would have been dismissed on 10 had New Zealand opted to query a caught-behind appeal that was not given, with Hot Spot detecting a faint edge.</p>
      <p>However, Burns said: “I didn’t feel like I hit it. I was quite surprised when Ross Taylor ran past at the end of the next over saying to one of the boys that apparently there was a Hot Spot.</p>
      <p>“I thought I missed it by a country mile but apparently I didn’t.”</p>
      <p>Burns revealed England’s safety-first approach – their run-rate hovered at just over two an over for most of the day – was partially because of Root’s plea as well as the sluggish pitch at the Bay Oval, hosting its first Test.</p>
      <p>The medium-fast pace of Colin De Grandhomme found some movement and Burns was one of the all-rounder’s victims as he finished with an impressive two for 28 from 19 overs.</p>

      <p>Asked whether England’s go-slow was down to the surface or their captain’s comments before the Test, Burns said: “Probably a little bit of both in all honesty.</p>
      <p>“The pitch seems like it’ll probably get slower so it’s lending itself to quite attritional cricket at points. You’ve got to scrap in and get in.”</p>
      <p>However, Burns added that he and former Surrey team-mate Dom Sibley – who made 22 on his Test debut in a 52-run opening stand – are disposed towards starting their innings cautiously.</p>
      <p>He said: “When me and Sibbo are walking out to the middle, the way we set up our four-day or five-day cricket is pretty traditional from both ends.</p>
      <p>“It was nice and it was also nice to walk out there with Sibbo, it’s the first time we’ve done that in a while. I thought the way we went about it was pretty good.”</p>

      <p>New Zealand seamer <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-wagner/"><b>Neil Wagner</b></a> credited England for their strategy although he believes they enjoyed moments of fortune.</p>
      <p>As well as Burns’ let-offs, Stokes was given a lifeline on 63 late in the day when the all-rounder’s edge burst through Taylor’s hands at first slip.</p>
      <p>Wagner said: “I thought we bowled really well, we asked really good questions for long periods of time and at the same time they batted really well.</p>
      <p>“Anything we threw at them, they played quite well. At times they had a bit of luck but sometimes you need a bit of luck, it happens in cricket.”</p>
