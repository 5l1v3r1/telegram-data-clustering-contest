      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> had major reservations about replacing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/unai-emery/">Unai Emery</a> as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> manager, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been appointed as Tottenham’s new manager following their surprise decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino earlier this week.</p>
      <p>But before his move to Spurs, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/arsenal-dines-jose-mourinho-pressure-builds-unai-emery-11033365/">Mourinho reportedly held talks with Arsenal’s head of football Raul Sanllehi about potentially replacing Unai Emery last month.</a></p>
      <p>Emery has been under pressure following a poor start to the campaign and Mourinho was reportedly under consideration to take charge as the Gunners were preparing for a change of management.</p>

      <p>Mourinho is understood to have impressed Sanllehi with his plans for Arsenal during their discussions.</p>
      <p>But according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/calling-out-players-and-falling-out-with-physios-where-it-all-went-wrong-for-jose-mourinho-at-manchester-united-2glljtqwv">The Times</a>, Mourinho was not fully convinced that Arsenal would be the best move for him.</p>

      <p>The report claims that the structure of Arsenal’s hierarchy ‘did not appeal’ to the Portuguese.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, former Arsenal defender Martin Keown has urged to Gunners to make a move for Pochettino.</p>
      <p>‘There’s no need to panic at Arsenal, we are getting close to panic by the way, because we’re not having the best of seasons, but the powers that be at the top of the club should be seriously considering Pochettino,’ said Keown.</p>
      <p>‘I have a lot of admiration for what he did at Tottenham, the way he nurtured those young players and he didn’t spend a great deal of money.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t think Tottenham spent enough.</p>
      <p>‘I know the poor record he has recently, I know it all but I still would have given him another chance. I don’t like the way Tottenham have done it.</p>
      <p>‘There will be a lot of chairmen looking at him now.</p>
      <p>‘Manchester United wanted him this time last year. I think Arsenal would have to be interested if they want to take a step forward.’</p>
