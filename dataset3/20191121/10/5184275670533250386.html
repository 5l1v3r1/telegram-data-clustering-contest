      <p>“It’s been a busy week and I have not been so gratified with my work in a long time. I think I will give in to the public demand of starting my own Tik Tok account. I don’t think I can be an avid user, but I look forward to make some videos on the platform. I would would love to explore and see what all ‘<i>Bala</i>‘ inspired and Pari Mishra inspired videos other users are making. Personally I would like to recreate some iconic videos from the 90s and do the hook steps to some amazing songs from that time like we did in the movie,” Yami said.</p>
      <p>Yami feels it “will be a good way to connect with the fans who have given the character so much love”.</p>
      <p>On the film front, she will be next seen in “<a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/yami-gautam-vikrant-masseys-ginny-weds-sunny-wraps-up/"><i>Ginny Weds Sunny</i></a>“, which is touted as a romantic comedy.</p>
