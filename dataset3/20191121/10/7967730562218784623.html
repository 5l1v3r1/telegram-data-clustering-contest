      <p>As a left-handed (C8) trainee in one of Sydney’s teacher colleges in the '50s, Robert Unwin of The Entrance was advised to learn to write legibly on the blackboard with his right hand if he wished to obtain a teaching certificate, as his body would obscure his writing to the students as he wrote on the board. Robert's thought: "Ridiculous! It was the right-handers who would do that. I was never tested and I’m sure none of my students ever suffered as a result of my non-compliance."</p>

        <b>As a "leftie" (C8) in his mid-70s, Mick McGillion of Blaxland had a very different childhood experience to others. "During a visit to the family doctor when I was aged about eight my mother asked if she should encourage me to use my right hand for writing. The doctor discouraged the idea, then wrote out a script for my medication with his left hand."</b>
      </p>
      <p>Moving on from the leftie hysteria of the past, Jack McCann of Wollstonecraft writes that he once worked with "a woman who had the extraordinary ability to write with both hands at the same time, one hand writing normally while the other wrote in mirror image. She used her talent during the war to write on photo negatives for defence use."</p>

        <b>After seeing television reports that the River Don had broken its banks in the Yorkshire town of Doncaster, Ron Sinclair of Bathurst emailed his family in Doncaster, hoping they were OK. "Almost simultaneously I received an email from them anxiously asking if we were adversely impacted by our bushfires! We subsequently assured each other we were amongst the fortunate ones."</b>

      <p>Colleen Burke of Drummoyne asks if anyone remembers "those entrepreneurs who put fresh air into aerosol cans for export to China. Could someone please tell me where they are getting the fresh air from? I want to go there."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Frank Paterson of Mount Annan was feeling very proud of himself after he put the digital version of his NSW driver's license on his phone using the Service NSW app. "A week later I was again in my local Service NSW centre to obtain my boat licence, where a driver’s licence was needed for proof of identity. I pulled out the phone, fired up the app and produced the digital licence only to be told that it couldn't be used - my plastic licence had to be photocopied. It had failed at its first test!"</b>
