      <h2>For Milkha Singh, age is just a number that does not stop Milkha Singh from playing 18 holes at the 7,202-yard long Chandigarh Golf Course</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:29:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/nitin-sharma/" target="_blank">Nitin Sharma</a></address>
      <p>It’s 1 p.m in the afternoon and Flying Sikh Milkha Singh makes his way to his Sector 8 home in his golf cart. For Singh, who turned 90 on Wednesday, age is just a number that does not stop him from playing 18 holes at the 7,202-yard long <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Golf Course.</p>
      <p>Greeted by fans at his home, the former Commonwealth and Asian Games champion says, “It’s a special day for me and the whole family but celebrations can wait. The reason I am here to see this day is my fitness regime and that’s what I followed at the start of the day,’’ says Singh, who plays golf thrice a week during which he walks the first nine holes before getting on to the cart.</p>
      <p>Not just that, he also jogs for more than 2 km at the Sukhna. “I want people to be passionate about their fitness. Everyone must take ten minutes of physical exercise daily at home or outside,” declares Singh.</p>
      <p>He attributes his present form to the six hours of training which he used to do in his youth.</p>
      <p>“I start my day with two eggs and two slices of toast along with juice and take 1-2 chapatis with dal and curd rice at lunch. Doctors have advised me not to take milk so I have curd from the desi cows at our farm.</p>
      <p>It has been close to three decades since I took a full meal during dinner. Instead, have a light snack, but this diet has kept me fit all these years,” adds Singh.</p>
