      <h1>Bristol Bears injury latest: Charles Piutau, Alapati Leiua, Andy Uren and Jordan Crane</h1>
      <h2>Key players joined the injured list but more set to return ahead of London Irish</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:47:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">John Evely</a></address>
      <p>Bristol Bears star back Charles Piutau has been ruled out of the club's trip to France to take on CA Brive tomorrow with injury.</p>
      <p>The former All Black full back has picked up an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>Piutau, 28, was rested during the Premiership Rugby Cup - the first four games of the 2019/20 season - as he recovered from an Achillies injury but returned for the opening Gallagher Premiership game against Bath Rugby and has played in every game since as Bristol have climbed to the top of the league table.</p>
      <p>He departed the field early last weekend in the Bears' 59-21 victory over Italian side Zebre in their opening game of the European Challenge Cup.</p>

      <p>The good news is Bristol Live understands Piutau's injury is a minor one and he is expected to be back in training next week ahead of the club's return to Premiership action against London Irish.</p>
      <p>Scrum half Andy Uren has also been sidelined this weekend after taking a blow to the head against Zebre.</p>
      <p>He is going through the HIA return to play protocols and has been replaced in the squad for the trip to France by Nic Stirzaker with Harry Randall starting at nine. Like Piutau he is expected to be back in training next week ahead of the visit of the Exiles on December 1.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the squad flanker Steven Luatua has returned early than expected after recovering from a blow to the hip in the 17-20 victory against Exeter Chiefs.</p>
      <p>Nathan Hughes [finger] and John Afoa [calf] <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/bristol-bears-injury-news-ahead-3552996">both miss the game against Brive as reported earlier in the week</a> as they continue to recover from injuries sustained against Exeter.</p>
      <p>Flanker Jake Heenan also rolled his ankle against the Chiefs and will not be available this weekend but should be back in contention to face to London Irish on December 1.</p>

      <p>Pat Lam has also provided an update on Samoan winger Alapati Leiua who injured his knee in Bristol's 43-16 victory over Bath Rugby in round one of the Premiership. He came off the bench in that game having returned from the Rugby World Cup earlier in the same week.</p>
      <p>Lam told Bristol Live: "Alapati Leiua is coming back from injury, he is not far off.</p>
      <p>"He should be in line and available for selection next week.</p>
      <p>"He is training this afternoon [Wednesday], he is on the Return to Performance team and I think this afternoon could be his first session back with the group."</p>
      <p>With a number of injuries in the backrow, the Bears are also set to be bolstered by the return of number eight Jordan Crane who has been recovering from a back injury.</p>
      <p>Lam added: "Craner is working his way back. Hopefully he will be available next week as well."</p>
      <p><b>Unavailable:</b> Shaun Malton (neck), Tom Lindsay (hamstring), John Afoa (calf), Jake Heenan (ankle), Nathan Hughes (finger), Blake Boyland (ankle), Andy Uren (head),  Alapati Leiua (knee), Jack Bates (hamstring), Luke Daniels (shoulder), Charles Piutau (ankle).</p>
