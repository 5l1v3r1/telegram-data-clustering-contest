      <p>Hospitality management chain Sarovar Hotels and Resorts, which is now operating with a portfolio of 80 properties across the country and some overseas locations, is on course to cross the 100 properties mark by 2021 or early 2022.</p>
      <p>Ajay Bakaya, Managing Director, Sarovar Hotels, said, “At Sarovar Hotels, we are embarking on our journey of managing 100 hotels soon. In line with our growth strategy within India and in Africa, we plan to strengthen our presence in existing locations and in new tier-II and -III cities.”</p>
      <p>“We have already signed new hotels in Jammu, Indore, Jalandhar, Ahmedabad, Udaipur and Panipat. Expecting to open hotels in Dalhousie, Indore, Rajahmundry, Pathankot, Jagdalpur, Ajmer, Guhagar (Maharastra), Dhamtari (Chhattisgarh) among others in next two years,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Currently Sarovar Hotels comprises over 6,400 keys under its three brands — Sarovar Premiere, Sarovar Portico and Hometel — with more than 80 hotels across 50 destinations. In line with our strategic business plan, we will add more than 2,000 keys in next three years,” Bakaya told BusinessLine.</p>
      <p>“We recently opened a hotel in Dindi, RVR Sarovar Portico, which is a 50-room property in East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh. Two more properties are in the pipeline in Rajahmundry, including a Convention centre scheduled to open this year and a 105-room five star hotel to open in early next year. Apart from this we are  operating hotels in Kakinada and Tirupati. ” he said.</p>
      <p>On the hospitality sector, Bakaya said, “In recent years we have seen many consolidations among hotel companies and online travel agents. Going forward, we’ll see the impact of these changes. We have been a part of similar progress and expect bigger and positive impact from this. Post GST cut, we expect better occupancies in the coming quarter as the season has already begun with weddings, foreign leisure travel, inbound traffic set to gain more traction.”</p>
      <p>“We are an asset light company and offer hotel management services assisting in setting up new hotels and then managing them. The current level of occupancy is about 70 per cent,” he said.</p>
      <p>Sarovar’s current portfolio includes two hotels in Nairobi, Kenya — The Heron Portico and The Zehneria Portico and one hotel in Lusaka, Zambia — Neelkanth Sarovar Premiere.</p>
      <p>“Our International expansion plan will see Sarovar expanding its all three brands in Africa with two premiere hotels in Somaliland and Ethiopia, One Portico in Dar Es Salaam Tanzania and Hometel in Nairobi Kenya,” he added</p>
