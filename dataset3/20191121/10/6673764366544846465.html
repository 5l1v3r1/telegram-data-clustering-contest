      <p><b>FUKUOKA – </b>Yokozuna Hakuho extended his lead at the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament with a win over Endo on Thursday as new komusubi Asanoyama suffered his third loss and fell two wins off the pace.</p>
      <p>Hakuho (11-1) blasted Endo (5-7) with his right forearm and issued a couple of ferocious slaps to bloody the komusubi’s nose and quickly put him down in the final bout of Day 12 at Fukuoka Kokusai Center.</p>
      <p>The Mongolian-born yokozuna, who moved closer capturing his record-extending 43rd makuuchi title, entered the ring with some added confidence after sekiwake Mitakeumi (6-6) delivered some inadvertent aid by pushing out Asanoyama (9-3).</p>
      <p>In the highlight bout of the day, Mitakeumi launched himself at Asanoyama and quickly drove May’s champion to the edge while keeping Asanoyama’s arms high and denying him a belt hold.</p>
      <p>Asanoyama could do little but struggle from there as the sekiwake inched him over the straw to even his record and earn a much-needed victory.</p>
      <p>Hakuho faces komusubi Abi on Day 13, while Asanoyama takes on No. 4 Kotoyuki. The meet’s top grapplers have already clashed, with Hakuho handing Asanoyama his first loss on Day 3.</p>
      <p>In other bouts, No. 5 Ryuden (5-7) pulled off an upset with a desperation move against Takakeisho (8-4). The ozeki found himself lunging at air and plunging to the sand as Ryuden promptly dashed to the side.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t really have (a plan of attack),” said Ryuden, who beat Takakeisho for the first time in three top-tier matchups. “I just tried to avoid getting hit.”</p>
      <p>Takakeisho is the last wrestler remaining at sumo’s second-highest rank at this basho, following the injury withdrawals of Takayasu and Goeido. Yokozuna Kakuryu and sekiwake Tochinoshin have also pulled out of the 15-day meet.</p>
      <p>Komusubi Abi improved to 7-5 with a win over No. 4 Tamawashi (6-6). Abi tried to pull down the former sekiwake while circling away, then switched tactics and shoved Tamawashi straight off the dohyo.</p>
      <p>Hokutofuji (5-7) avoided a losing record with a reversal against No. 2 Meisei (5-7). The komusubi was nearly pulled out after bouncing back from the edge, but spun out of the maegashira’s clutches and thrust him down to the sand.</p>
      <p>Among the other wrestlers who started the day two wins behind Hakuho, No. 10 Shodai (9-3) held his position with a push-out win over No. 15 Daishomaru (4-8), while No. 13 Kagayaki (8-4) was upended by No. 11 Ishiura (7-5) and fell off the leaderboard.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Chiyomaru and No. 12 Takanosho picked up victories on to secure winning records in their return to the top division. Chiyomaru pushed out No. 8 Sadanoumi (6-6) and Takanosho slapped down No. 6 Enho (6-6).</p>
      <p>No. 7 Kotoeko, No. 10 Shimanoumi and No. 15 Daishomaru each suffered a decisive eighth loss.</p>
