        <figcaption>About the place: Pondicherry — officially named Puducherry — is a union territory that is located in the state of Tamil Nadu, and shares its culture and language. Sometimes, tourists refer to it as 'Pondy', and consider it to be an artsy escape from the boring confines of city life. It is also hailed as the 'French Riviera of the East'. Pondy is one town that has all the Indian sensibilities and the best of the French world vis-à-vis architecture. It is but obvious that the coastal town is dotted with beaches. Pictured here, is one such beach that defines the town's coastline. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>How to reach: This should not be a problem, since Pondy is well connected to almost all major Indian cities via air, rail and road network. Chennai is the biggest city that lies in close proximity to the union territory. Once in Chennai, Pondy is a beautiful and comfortable car ride away. Once you make it, you can travel around either on foot, or experience the joy of a rickshaw ride, especially in and around the French quarters. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Best time to visit: Pondy is best visited between October and March, when the temperatures are most suitable. The summer months are quite hot and humid here, given it is close to the sea. Pictured here, is a blissful sunrise at the Promenade Beach. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Other places to explore: The most touristy thing to do when you land here, is to hit the beach. For people who do not get to see beaches often, Pondy offers the best experience. After a nice, long stroll, you can head over to the town's French corners just to admire the architecture. For photographers, this could be extremely satisfying, given the aesthetics and quietude of the place. There are many 'Instagrammable' corners here, too. Ask locals for directions.

        <figcaption>Next, head over to the Aurobindo Ashram, which is located in the White Town. The ashram is named after its creator, Sri Aurobindo Ghosh. It is believed the ashram's foundation was laid in November, 1926 when Rishi Aurobindo decided to retire from politics and settle here. The ashram tries to help people attain inner peace, spiritual knowledge and moksha, by means of meditation. Away from the humdrum of city life, this place cannot be missed.

        <figcaption>While there are several things you can do here -- depending upon your travel agenda -- there are a few important places that are unmissable. Among them, is the beautiful Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It is one of the most sacred places in Pondy, located some 2.5 km from the Pondicherry bus station. It is believed to be one of the 21 basilicas in India, set up by the French missionaries in 1908. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Pictured here is the 'Aayi Mandapam', or the Park Monument, which is a pearly white edifice constructed during the reign of Napolean III -- the erstwhile Emperor of France. It is said that the monument was built in honour of a courtesan named 'Aayi', who had razed her own house so she could build a reservoir for the town folk. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>When in Pondy, you cannot miss Auroville, or the 'City of Dawn' -- an experimental township which wants "men and women of all countries to be able to live in peace and progressive harmony above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities". The township was inaugurated in February 1968. For those searching for peace and tranquility, this town is a perfect hideaway. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Food in Pondy: There are many cafes here that serve a variety of gourmet food. Not only are the cafes beautiful, the food is mouthwatering, too. Before you actually make it to France, visit a quaint French cafe in Pondy and ruminate on life. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)</figcaption>
