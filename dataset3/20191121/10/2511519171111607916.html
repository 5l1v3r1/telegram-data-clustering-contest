      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/football-manager">Football Manager</a> has returned for another season and, as ever, the race is on to unearth the best wonderkids in the game.</p>
      <p>Every player faces a tough decision as they begin their virtual managerial career: do you start with a rich super-club such as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ManchesterUnited">Manchester United</a> or <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a>, or do you instead try and lead a much more modest club up the football pyramid?</p>
      <p>If you choose the latter option then you’re going to need to become an expert in the transfer market – and you’re almost certainly going to need to pick up a wonderkid or two on the cheap.</p>
      <p>A wonderkid is a player aged 20 or below who has the potential to go on and become a world-class player in the game.</p>
      <p>There are the usual recognisable names in our list – such as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ACMilan">AC Milan</a>’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/gianluigi-donnarumma">Gianluigi Donnarumma</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/paris-saint-germain">Paris Saint-Germain</a>’s Kylian Mbappé and Atlético Madrid’s João Félix – but also some youngsters with a much smaller profile. Snap them up early, and they could help take your team to the next level.</p>
      <p>Check the above gallery to see the top wonderkids in the game.</p>
