      <p>“I’ve been a fan of Jonathan’s work for years, and have enjoyed the opportunity to write <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP-gN-Y9RwE&amp;feature=emb_title">a few songs</a> with him, so was really excited to do a performance together for <i>SongWriter</i>,” Arthur tells <i>Paste</i>. “He invited his friend Cindy Lee Berryhill to write a song in response, and Jonathan and I wrote a song for the performance, as well. I love hearing how the music of Jonathan’s story bleeds into both the songs in different ways.”</p>
