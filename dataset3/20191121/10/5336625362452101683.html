      <p>There’s nothing like falling into a deep, delicious slumber after a long, hard day of adulting. But plenty of things get in the way of good sleep: stress, anxiety, discomfort, and car alarms — to name a few. </p>
      <p>You’ve probably heard of Gravity blankets by now, a brand name product that sits within the wider category of weighted blankets. (We named them our top pick for napping in <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-weighted-blankets/">this roundup</a>.) </p>
      <p>Weighted blankets can help to reduce stress and anxiety, ultimately helping you fall asleep faster. Eight Sleep has an amazing <a href="https://zdcs.link/y0gJ2">early access Black Friday deal</a>, and it couldn't come at a better time: When you buy Eight Sleep’s Pod mattress, you’ll knock $200 off and get <a href="https://zdcs.link/y0gJ2">a free Eight Sleep &amp; Gravity Blanket</a>, plus free shipping. That’s a total value of $450.</p>

        <b>What’s a Pod mattress?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Pod mattress tracks and learns your sleeping patterns based on biometric data. We’ve named <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-online-mattresses/">it the best mattress out there for temperature regulation</a>, which means it will adjust its temperature for your optimal comfort, so you’re never too hot or too cold. It has a “thermo alarm” that gradually cools you as you wake, smart home integration, and an AI Sleep Coach personalized just for you. Buying it during Eight Sleep’s <a href="https://zdcs.link/y0gJ2">early Black Friday sale</a> means free shipping, $200 off, and a free Gravity blanket to boot. </p>

        <b>Tell me more about this Gravity blanket</b>
      </p>
      <p>Designed by Gravity exclusively for Eight Sleep, this limited-edition weighted throw reduces stress and anxiety through the power of deep touch pressure stimulation.

Worried about overheating? The micro-fiber cooling duvet has your back (or front, or side, depending on your sleep position.) Wrapping yourself up in this blanket has been described as a full-body hug. </p>
