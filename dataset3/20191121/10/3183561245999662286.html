      <p>As we head into deep Samsung Galaxy S11 leak season, more rumours have emerged regarding a new <i>lighter</i> model, the Galaxy S11 Lite, that might be coming to the lineup. Strangely, a new leak suggests it's anything but light.</p>

      <p>Prominent leaker, Ishan Agarwal, posted to Twitter that the Lite will come with a Snapdragon 855 processor and an impressive camera setup. On the rear, it's alleged to come with a 48MP main camera with a 5MP depth lens and a 12MP wide angle. For the selfie camera, a 32MP lens.</p>

      <p>The Galaxy S10e, a smaller version with one less camera, was released in May 2019 and gave us a powerful phone for a slightly cheaper price. <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-s10/specs/">That model came with</a> a 10MP selfie camera as well as a 12MP wide angle lens and a 16MP ultra wide lens on the rear. So the camera specs on this Lite model seem much better somehow despite everyone expecting the price will be less.</p>

      <p>The inclusion of a Snapdragon 855 processor is also interesting. That chip is found in both models of the Google Pixel 4 as well as the Galaxy S10 and Note 10 series and OPPO Reno to name a few. While the rest of the <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/samsung-galaxy-s11-specs-leaks-rumours/">Galaxy S11 lineup is rumoured to come</a> with the next Qualcomm processor, Snapdragon 865, the 855 is still one of the best mobile processors out there right now.</p>
      <p>In Australia, however, Samsung devices often come with Samsung's Exynos chips as opposed to Snapdragon so if the rumours turn out to be true, a Samsung equivalent, like the Exynos 9 Series 9825 seen in the Note 10 series, could be fitted into the device.</p>
      <p>If this truly is Samsung's new entry model for Galaxy S11 series, it's a pretty impressive one. Let's hope it's just as impressive in terms of pricing too.</p>
