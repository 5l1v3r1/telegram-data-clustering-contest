      <h1>Mourinho unlikely to get a January windfall as details of Pochettino exit emerge</h1>

        <b>New Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho is unlikely to receive any funds to buy players in January unless he sells some of his squad. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese will make his first remarks to the media on Thursday after penning a three-and-a-half-year deal with the North London outfit.</p>
      <p>Mourinho and Spurs chairman Daniel Levy are believed to have agreed that retaining Harry Kane's services is the top priority. Mourinho may now be able to persuade England striker that when given a full season, he can deliver silverware to the club.</p>
      <p>Levy wasn't forthcoming with a reservoir of transfer funds for the axed Mauricio Pochettino during the White Hart Lane stadium rebuild, and Mourinho is set to have to work the type of magic he brought to Porto and Inter Milan rather than having the blank chequebook that was available at Real Madrid and Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Jose has appointed a new backroom staff, with Joao Sacramento joining from Lille, who had an excellent run in the French League last season.</p>
      <p>It's understood Mourinho is happy with the strength of the Tottenham squad, and while he made a specific nod to the importance of youth which could be reassuring to Troy Parrott, it's the defensive positions that the new Head Coach will look to bolster.</p>
      <p>Toby Alderweireld, Jan Vertonghen and Danny Rose may be allowed to leave the club if no new deals are signed, while Christian Eriksen's medium term future remains up in the air.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is a known fan of Eric Dier, who may now come in from the cold after not being an automatic choice under Pochettino.</p>
      <p>It's emerged that Amazon, who are filming a fly-on-the-wall documentary at Spurs this season, were on hand to capture Pochettino's departure and Mourinho's arrival.</p>
      <p>It's also reported that Pochettino's request to have training sessions filmed was turned down for budgetary reasons, which is ironic given that the cameras ended up being turned on him.</p>
      <p>Although he left the club with a £12.5 million pay off, sacked Pochettino was not allowed to say goodbye to the squad. Instead, he left a note wishing them the best.</p>
      <p>It's the brutality of modern football, that having led Tottenham to their first Champions League final back in June, the Argentine would be yesterday's news when it came to Tottenham even before the paint was dry.</p>
