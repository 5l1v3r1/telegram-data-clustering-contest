      <h1>Gareth Bale: Spanish press turn on Real Madrid forward – ‘Disrespectful. Misguided. Ungrateful. In that order’</h1>
      <h2>Bale mocked the perception of himself in Spain during Wales’ celebrations after qualifying for Euro 2020 </h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:35:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jack Rathborn</a></address>
      <p>The Madrid press have predictably come after <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethBale">Gareth Bale</a> after the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a> forward celebrated Wales’s qualification for Euro 2020 alongside a flag that read: “Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order”.</p>
      <p>Bale has long since had a frosty relationship with the Madrid-based press with constant speculation over his future.</p>
      <p>While Bale will feel mistreated by the club after Zinedine Zidane overlooked him this year to push him towards the Bernabeu exit, he must surely have known how the images from Tuesday night would go down back in the Spanish capital.</p>
      <p>Marca’s front page responded: “Disrespectful. Misguided. Ungrateful. In that order.”</p>
      <p>While AS columnist Tomas Roncero did his own play on the flag, writing: “Out. Out. Out.”</p>

      <p>AS also led with Bale’s relationship with Real on their front page, emphasising the flag incident was the last straw and that Real’s patience has run out.</p>
      <p>But Bale appears comfortable for now, with a contract that runs until 2022, a January exit appears unlikely no matter the desire from Los Blancos to make it happen.</p>
