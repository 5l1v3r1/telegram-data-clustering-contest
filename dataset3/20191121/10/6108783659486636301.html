      <h3>"We designed [Project] Scarlett with the cloud in mind as well."</h3>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/xbox-one-s/">Xbox One S</a> consoles in <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud</a> racks will eventually be replaced by <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-scarlett/">Project Scarlett</a>, Microsoft’s Kareem Choudhry confirmed with Stevivor.</p>
      <p>For xCloud, Microsoft has deployed 2U racks with eight Xbox One S consoles in each across thirteen Azure data centres worldwide. Choudhry told Stevivor that Project xCloud will evolve over time.</p>
      <p>“We designed [Project] Scarlett with the cloud in mind as well, and just as you’re going to see our console product family evolve with that next generation, the cloud is going to evolve along with it,” Choudhry told Stevivor at X019.</p>
      <p>Fortune Magazine was walked through current Project xCloud hardware in the video below.</p>
      <p><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/project-xcloud/">Project xCloud</a> is in an active trial in the UK, the US and Korea. The preview program <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/project-xcloud-heads-canada-india-japan-2020/">will extend to more regions</a> — and <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/project-xcloud-heads-to-pc-other-devices-in-2020/">more devices</a> — in 2020.</p>
