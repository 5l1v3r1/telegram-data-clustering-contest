      <p>DUBAI: Iran handed over the state’s Yemeni embassy to the Houthi militia, a move condemned by the Arab Leauge, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul Gheit condemned Iran’s step considering it a flagrant violation of diplomatic norms and of the United Nations Charter, the Vienna Convention, and the relevant Security Council resolutions.</p>
      <p>The move, he said, also reflects an Iranian insistence to destabilize Yemen’s conditions, and threaten the security of its neighbouring countries.</p>
