      <p>The story, done by Africa Correspondent John Sparks identified the stowaway, who fell from a KQ’s landing gear moments before touching down at London’s Heathrow Airport in June, as Paul Manyasi.</p>

      <p>Sparks reported that the man was an employee of Colnet, a company that offers cleaning services at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA).</p>
      <p>Both Colnet and the Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) denied the reports saying no such employee existed on JKIA register.</p>
      <p>However, it has now been established that the photos used by the media are those of a man identified as Cedric Shivonje, a remandee at Kamiti Prison.</p>
      <p>In a recent interview with <i>Nation</i>, Shivonje stated that he is not the stowaway.</p>

      <p>The man, charged of defilement, said the photos used in the story were taken from his Facebook page.</p>
      <p>“I am alive, as you can see,” said Shivonje.</p>
      <p>Shivonje further stated that he is 25-years-old and not 29 as reported by Sky News.</p>
      <p>Shivonje’s father who was in the company of the <i>Nation</i> team had earlier dismissed the reports that his son was dead.</p>
      <p>The man identified as Isaac Betti was filmed in the British media’s story confirming that the bag and the shoes recovered by London’s Metropolitan Police were owned by his son.</p>
      <p>In the <i>Nation</i> story, Betti said the Sky News team gave him Ksh20,000 after the interview. The man couldn’t, however, explain the intention of the journalist when he gave him the money.</p>
