      <p>Jose Mourinho taking over at Tottenham Hotspur has given the Portuguese media an opportunity to go crazy again on a Bruno Fernandes transfer.</p>
      <p>Friday’s edition of <a href="http://abola.pt/">A Bola</a> has Jose Mourinho and the Sporting midfielder splashed across the front page, with it stating ‘Mourinho opens the door for Bruno’.</p>
      <p>Inside it’s reported the player’s signing ‘gains strength’ at Tottenham, and an attempt for the player ‘could happen as early as January’.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is said to ‘greatly appreciate’ the midfielder, and it’s stated Spurs were the only club to make a concrete attempt during the summer. Therefore, the ‘perfect storm’ is now in place at the London club.</p>

      <p>Champions League.</p>
      <p>It’s known Tottenham made that offer, Sporting’s president has spoken about it publicly. Spurs either moved because Mauricio Pochettino wanted the player, or because Daniel Levy decided he could be an alternative to Giovani Lo Celso, and which of those scenarios was true, and what happens to the, technically still owned by Real Betis, Argentine could be key.</p>
      <p>So far, this is all based on circumstantial evidence.</p>
