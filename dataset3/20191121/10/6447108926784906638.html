      <h1>Is a new Crash Bandicoot game coming to PS5?</h1>

      <p>We’re roughly a year away from the launch of Sony’s next big home console but right now we’re in the dark as to what games will actually be making an appearance on PS5. If a series of clues mined from a new PlayStation marketing campaign turn out to be legit, we may see platforming hero Crash Bandicoot among the vanguard of next generation games arriving in 2020.</p>

      <p>Rumours stem from the minute long video above. Uploaded to the official PlayStation channel earlier this month, this incredible live action ad showcases an impressive number of cameos and has already been watched more than 1.6 million times. Next to Kratos we see characters such as Cloud, Nathan Drake, Ellie, Aloy, and Deacon St. John, as well as Crash Bandicoot.</p>
      <p>Alongside Dr. Neo Cortex and Coco Bandicoot, the trio race through a multi-story car park in a scene clearly meant to advertise <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/21/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review-ps4-xbox-switch/">Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fuelled</a>. It’s not the only non-exclusive game to feature in the video with Monster Hunter World, Fortnite, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare also popping up.</p>

      <p>However, looking a little closer, fans have picked up on a minor detail that could suggest a new Crash Bandicoot game is in the wings. Look a little closer and Coco and you’ll spot that she’s being followed by a floating mask similar to Aku Aku. Whoever this character is they do not feature in Crash Team Racing leading many to speculate this is a tease for Activision’s next Crash title.</p>
      <p>It’s by no means confirmation though a tweet from Toys for Bob character designer Nicholas Kole has certainly fuelled speculation surrounding the rumours. Toys for Bob is best known for its work on the Skylanders franchise as well as the recent Crash Bandicoot and Spyro remakes. It has yet to be announced what the studio is currently working on.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile a bus ad spotted in the UK (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crashbandicoot/comments/dw7zu5/dont_know_if_this_has_been_posted_yet_but_i_saw/">via Reddit user “aneegles”</a>) shows Crash again, brandishing a set of keys. Fans have commented on how this particular version of the manic marsupial looks more akin to Naughty Dog’s original design from the 90s.</p>

      <p>So, what could this all point to? With Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fuelled having been a big success, this could be Sony trying to punch up its Christmas marketing campaign with a mascot older PlayStation fans are familiar with. However, given that same success, it’s clear that Activision has <i>something</i> planned for Crash.</p>
      <p>According to one leaker (who is said to have had an accurate beat on both the Crash and Spyro trilogies) this could be an upcoming game called Crash Bandicoot Worlds. The supposed <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanPS88/status/1196193164358537220?s=20">4chan leak</a> briefly details a 3D action platformer that will be announced next month – just in time for The Game Awards perhaps?</p>
