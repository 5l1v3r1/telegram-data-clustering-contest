      <h1>Cayetano turns tables on ex-president in ‘kaldero’ controversy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:42:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/jester-p-manalastas" target="_blank">Jester P. Manalastas</a></address>
      <h3>HOW about the P10 billion budget for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders Meeting in 2015?</h3>
      <p>Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano has reminded the opposition, particularly former President Benigno Aquino III and the Liberal Party, that they once spent a huge amount of money for an international event.</p>
      <p>“Namamahalan kayo sa P50 million, pero sa P10 billion, okay lang sa inyo?” Cayetano asked the opposition.</p>
      <p>Cayetano yesterday slammed the former President for questioning the P55 million worth cauldron that will be used for the 2019 Southeast Asian Games.</p>
      <p>“Nakalimutan niya na kinausap niya ako nung ako ay Majority Leader sa Senado at nakita ko sa budget, 10 billion pesos para sa APEC. Sa APEC po. At ano ang sabi niya sa amin? “Huwag kayong mag-ingay before and during, dahil lahat ng bansa, international press, nandito,” Cayetano said in a speech during an inspection of the SEA Games sports facilities at the New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac.</p>
      <p>Cayetano said he was wondering then why there seemed to be extravagance in spending for the APEC meeting and yet Aquino defended the budget.</p>
      <p>“Sir, bakit medyo magarbo ‘yung mga gala night, ibang mga kagamitan?” (Sir, why does the gala night and the facilities seem to be luxurious?” the Speaker recalled asking Aquino who replied: “Boss, representasyon ‘to ng ating bansa</p>
      <p>The former president and his allies in the LP led by Sen. Franklin Drilon have been criticizing the cost of the cauldron, saying the amount was enough to build 50 classrooms.</p>
      <p>In defending the construction of the cauldron, Cayetano and his allies said that this is actually  cheaper compared to the P62 million cauldron of Singapore in 2015 and P85 million cauldron of Malaysia in 2017.</p>
      <p>Aquino said last Thursday that the government should have prioritized more important projects, adding that the cauldron will only be used for a few days.</p>
      <p>Cayetano, chairman of the Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC), said the opposition is obviously just gearing for the 2022 national elections.</p>
      <p>“I said, don’t worry. After the games, kahit araw-arawin niyo ‘ko, ako haharap. Ako sasagot. Kung may kailangan idemanda, ako idemanda niyo. Pero ‘wag before and during the games. E araw-araw nasa TV e. Talagang ‘yung all-talk lang, Operation: All-talk Lang, parang 2022 na siguro nasa isip,” Cayetano added.</p>
      <p>Cayetano said Aquino  has no right to question the P55-million cauldron since the APEC budget  during his administration could have built 10,000 classrooms.</p>
      <p>“Ilan ba ang dapat nagawang classroom kung hindi natin hinost ang APEC? 10,000 classrooms? Tapos simbolo ng SEA Games, simbolo po ng ating mga atleta, fighting spirit of the Filipino, P50 million, titirahin nila,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Speaker said the cauldron, the final work of art of the late national artist Francisco “Bobby” Mañosa, can be sold for as much as P100 million.</p>
