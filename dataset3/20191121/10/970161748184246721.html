      <p>The latest rumours suggest Amazon could unveil their own streaming service next year, in what is becoming a very crowded market.</p>
      <p>Despite the backing of Google, it seems fair to say that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/google-stadia-uk-review-video-game-streaming-becomes-a-reality-11178888/">Stadia</a> has not set the world alight so far – although who knows how the service may evolve in the future.</p>
      <p>It will have plenty of competition the longer time goes on though, not just Microsoft’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-streaming-service-adds-xbox-game-pass-games-11148301/">Project xCloud</a> and whatever Sony’s cooking up but also competition from Amazon, who have been rumoured to be working on their own streaming service for some time now.</p>
      <p>According to a new report by <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/google-stadia-wants-to-be-the-future-of-gaming-so-do-microsoft-sony-and-amazon/">CNET</a> Amazon’s service will be publicly revealed next year and is powered by the company’s existing AWS cloud tech.</p>

      <p>Since they own Twitch, Amazon does have an obvious leverage in setting up its own service – just as Google has with owning YouTube (the fact that none of the YouTube features work yet could be argued as one of the main reasons Stadia currently doesn’t seem that appealing).</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Amazon is currently recruiting staff from rivals including Microsoft, and some of its <a href="https://gamejobs.global/jobs/amazon-game-studios/principal-product-leader-new-aws-gaming-initiative/8681">job ads</a> make it pretty clear what they’re aiming for:</p>
      <p>‘We believe the evolution that began with arcade communities a quarter at a time, growing to the live streams and esports of today, will continue to a future where everyone is a gamer and every gamer can create, compete, collaborate and connect with others at massive scales’.</p>
      <p>Apart from Twitch, Amazon has long had an on and off again interest in the video games industry, setting up a number of its own internal studios only to cancel many of the projects.</p>
      <p>Although CNET’s insiders claim that the Amazon service will be announced next year no-one seems to know when it will actually launch.</p>
      <p>But given the PlayStation 5 and next gen Xbox are also due to be revealed sometime in 2020 that is going to make for a very busy year and create such a crowded market that it’s inevitable not every company is going to find success.</p>
      <p>Sony, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon all offering similar services, and demanding similar subscriptions and/or hardware purchases is clearly untenable for the average gamer, even before you add in Nintendo, Apple, and individual games with their own subscription fees.</p>
      <p>There’s going to be some high-profile winners and losers in the next generation and at this point in time it’s very hard to predict who they’re going to be.</p>
