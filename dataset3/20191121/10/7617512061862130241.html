      <p>A Courtenay man has died after an assault in downtown Courtenay on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Sean Parker, 46, died at Victoria General Hospital, said sister Natalie Parker.</p>
      <p>Comox Valley RCMP officers responded to a report of an assault on the 350-block of 6th Street in Courtenay at about 1:25 p.m. on Tuesday and found a man unconscious on the sidewalk. He was taken to hospital by ambulance with life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>“The investigation that began as a serious assault is now a homicide after the victim passed away in hospital yesterday afternoon,” Comox Valley RCMP Const. Monika Terragni said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Police said they identified a person of interest in the assault on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>The victim and the suspect were at the Courtenay library shortly before getting into an altercation that resulted in the victim suffering a serious head injury, said Staff Sgt. Glen Breckon of the Comox Valley RCMP’s major crime unit.</p>
      <p>Breckon, who described the area on 6th street as busy, put a call out for witnesses to the dispute at the library, or anyone with video from around the time of the assault.</p>
      <p>“Investigators have spoken with several witnesses. However, we believe there are more witnesses out there who have not yet come forward,” said Breckon.</p>
      <p>Anyone with related information is asked to call Comox Valley RCMP at 250-338-1321 and refer to file number 2019-17839.</p>
