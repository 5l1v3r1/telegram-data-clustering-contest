      <p>Facebook’s unveiling of its proposed Libra cryptocurrency this summer was “ridiculously stupid,” according to the boss of a company building its own blockchain ecosystem.</p>
      <p>“The way they rolled it out … it was just so in your face,” R3 CEO David Rutter said at a recent company conference, <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/r3s-david-rutter-what-facebook-did-was-ridiculously-stupid-20191118?mod=home-page">according to Financial News</a>. “There’s a lack of understanding.”</p>
      <p>Facebook underestimated the complexity of building a cryptocurrency ecosystem, Rutter said, according to Financial News. For example, the social-media giant suggested underpinning Libra with a weighted basket of currencies, but translating digital coins back into different currencies is “not simple,” he said. “It’s really naïve.”</p>
      <p>R3, which was founded as a consortium of top-tier banks, is working with more than 300 partners to build an open-source blockchain platform called Corda, as well as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/r3-launches-corda-open-source-blockchain-platform-2018-7?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">paid version for businesses</a>.</p>
      <p>Libra has drawn intense scrutiny from government regulators, prompting launch partners including Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/paypal-drops-out-of-facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-project-report-2019-10?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">walk back their support</a>. Lawmakers have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-testifies-congress-libra-cryptocurrency-2019-10?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">grilled Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other executives</a> on whether they can be trusted to protect users’ privacy, handle vast amounts of financial data, and other issues.</p>
