      <p>Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Thursday said Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy could have ended the controversy over his alleged “arrogant behaviour” with the seer of Kuruba community by apologising to Eshwarananda Puri Swami, seer of Kanaka Gurupeeta, Kaginele.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters in Mysuru before heading to Hunsur constituency for the byelection campaign, Mr. Siddaramaiah said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has issued an apology. “Why did the Chief Minister tender an apology if there was no mistake (by Mr. Madhuswamy),” he asked.</p>
      <p>The issue over the naming of a circle in Huliyar town became a caste controversy after the community members accused the Law Minister of “insulting” the seer at a meeting called recently to discuss the naming of the circle.</p>
      <p>Kuruba community members have been staging protests across the State seeking the resignation of Mr. Madhuswamy and also an apology to the seer.</p>
      <p>Referring to the call for a bandh in Huliyar, Mr. Siddaramaiah felt the Minister should have expressed his regrets for the alleged comments and closed the matter.</p>
      <p>He said the people have understood the “true colours” of the disqualified MLAs who are fighting the byelections on December 5 since they are fully aware of their motives behind defections. “I need not have to talk about the episode in my election rallies.”</p>
      <p>On the accusations of Hoskote BJP candidate MTB Nagaraj that he and other Congress leaders took money from him, Mr. Siddaramaiah denied the claims and said he never took money from Mr. Nagaraj. “He (Mr. Nagaraj) allegedly funded the BJP’s Operation Lotus. Out of desperation, the disqualified MLAs were making unfounded allegations,” he charged.</p>
