      <p>It would be nigh on impossible to go to Madrid on business and not get caught up in the social whirl of the city. And frankly, who wouldn’t want to have a bit of fun too? While the traditional business area is along the Paseo de la Castellana, downtown hotels are becoming ever more popular with visitors who want to experience the vibrancy of the Spanish capital. We've rounded up Madrid's hottest hotels that do their part in blurring the line between work, leisure and pleasure.</p>

      <p>In the smart Salamanca district, with the city’s best shops and restaurants on the doorstep, Bless feels a bit like a fashionable private club – albeit one where the local residents and professionals like to hang out. Multi-Michelin-starred chef Martín Berasategui is behind the Etxeko restaurant and you are never far from a gin and tonic, whether on the roof terrace, in the buzzy lobby bar or down in the Fetén club in the basement. If you don’t feel like leaving your room to go to the spa, a bath butler will appear to provide lotions and potions tailored to your mood – they really look after their guests here. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/bless-madrid-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 233 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/bless-hotel-madrid.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-BLESS2Madrid">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>In an elegant, central location off the tourist beat, The Pavilions is filled with contemporary artworks and is a cross between a gallery and a boutique hotel. Chic and discreet with a good restaurant, it immediately became a favourite with people in the creative industries when it opened. If you want to work in your room, marble café-style tables and curving banquettes make the experience less of a chore. Step outside the door and you can join Madrid’s young professionals in juice bars and trendy restaurants, while the best shops are a short walk away in the Salamanca neighbourhood. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/the-pavilions-madrid-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 92 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/amador-de-los-rios.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-The2Pavilions2Madrid">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This is one for business travellers who are in the know. In Triball, a location that is now screamingly hip but until recently was regarded as a bit grungy, the 7 Islas strips away fussy frills to focus on what’s important, which here is all about making their guests feel at home – whether that means providing yoga mats or creating a bespoke cocktail with their homemade gins. Oh yes, the cocktails… Narciso Bermejo, one of the top barmen in Spain, is in charge here, so you have a head start when it comes to impressing your colleagues. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/7-islas-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 77 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/sieteislas.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-72Islas2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>When you need true luxury with no gimmicks, privacy and superb service, the boutique Heritage is the top hotel in Madrid. With distinctive, exquisite interiors, a restaurant run by the Michelin-starred Mario Sandoval and a very pretty roof terrace, this is somewhere you can meet clients without being disturbed or simply relax in total peace. The hotel is in the upscale Salamanca neighbourhood, away from the main tourist areas but close to the capital’s top restaurants and shops. Crucially, given the usual gridlock in Madrid, it is the right side of the city for airport access, which only takes around 20 minutes by taxi as you avoid the downtown traffic. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/heritage-madrid-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 219 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/heritage-madrid.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-Heritage2Madrid2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>There might well be a conference or two going on at this centrally-located five-star hotel, but the sense of light, space and peace means you would never know. You are more likely to notice the fashion and media crowd hanging out in the Gingko Skybar on the 12th floor, where there is also a very welcome pool on the roof terrace. If you want to wow anyone, just bring them up here and let them take in the 360-degree views – this is probably the best vantage point in the city. Rooms have large desks with plenty of easy-to-access sockets and some have crosstrainers and stationary bikes. The Biloba Spa has a 24-hour gym and a hydrotherapy pool, so you’ve really got all bases covered without even trying if you stay here. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/vp-plaza-espana-design-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 159 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/vp-plaza-espana-design.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-VP2Plaza2Espa%C3%B1a2Design">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>Location, location, location… being right next to the cool neighbourhoods of Malasaña, Chueca and Salesas makes the Bastardo a key venue for young entrepreneurs in Madrid, whether they are staying there or not. The massive, industrial-style lobby, with a restaurant at one end and a bar at the other, is somewhere you can do a bit of work without feeling cut off from the energy of the surroundings – and have a craft beer and a tapa (Spanish appetiser) while you’re at it. If you’re travelling solo, there are frequent events and performances, as well as yoga sessions on the roof. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/bastardo-hostel-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 15 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/bastardo-hostel.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-Bastardo2Hostel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>There’s a bit of a loft-living vibe going on at the Only You Atocha, with oversized squashy leather sofas, swirling bookshelves and open-brick walls in the lobby. There’s always going to be a corner free to do some work or just take in the scene. Pop-ups might include a barber shop, a premium gin bar or a cupcake stand. It's right by Atocha train station with fast access by bus or train from the airport, while also close to the Reina Sofia and other major museums. And with the Retiro Park just up the road for a morning or evening run and a 24-hour gym, this is a hugely handy place to stay. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/spain/madrid/hotels/only-you-hotel-atocha//">Read expert review</a> From £ 104 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/es/only-you-atocha.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1spain1madrid1articles1best0modern0business0hotels0madrid-Only2You2Hotel2Atocha">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
