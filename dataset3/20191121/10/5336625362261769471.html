      <h1>The best place to buy an Instant Pot on Black Friday may surprise you</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/leah-stodart/" target="_blank">Leah Stodart</a></address>
      <p>Was the <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-instant-pot-to-buy-recipes-deals-amazon/">Instant Pot</a> one of the best-selling products on Black Friday last year? Is the Pope Catholic? Is water wet?</p>
      <p>Surprising absolutely no one, the 8-quart Instant Pot Lux was <a href="https://abc13.com/shopping/see-what-people-bought-over-thanksgiving-weekend-in-your-state/4788717/">Walmart's best-selling item in 33 states</a> on Black Friday 2018. The 6-quart Instant Pot Duo was one of the <a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-announces-record-breaking-holiday-shopping-weekend-cyber?tag=mashable0c-20">most popular items on Amazon</a> on Cyber Monday 2018. <a href="https://mashable.com/category/black-friday/">Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019</a> will probably be a similar story with the addition of new models that were just released in summer 2019.</p>
      <p>From what we've seen during our investigations of all the major <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/black-friday-2019-ad-scans-best-deals/">Black Friday 2019 ad scans</a> (thanks to the intrepid work of our pals at <a href="https://blackfriday.com/">BlackFriday.com</a>), where to find the best Instant Pot deals will <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-instant-pot-to-buy-recipes-deals-amazon/">depend on the model you want</a>.</p>

          <b>So what makes the Instant Pot so special, anyway?</b>
        </a>
        <b> </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Where to buy the Instant Pot Duo:</b> For now, <a href="https://zdcs.link/5d7jY">Walmart</a>. The ad scan shows that the <a href="https://zdcs.link/3PxdR">6-quart 7-in-1 Duo</a> will be $49, which is $30 off the original price and the same price that it was on <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/amazon-prime-day-2019-instant-pot-deals-duo-lux-ultra/">Prime Day 2019</a>. This matches the lowest price on Amazon history (actually, it's $0.95 cheaper), and though Amazon doesn't release an official ad scan, it's very possible that it will undercut Walmart with an <a href="https://zdcs.link/jVBop">even better price on the Duo</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Where to buy the Instant Pot Duo Nova:</b> <a href="https://zdcs.link/4Be3D">Target</a> with the steal. The front page of <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/ads/target-black-friday/">Target's Black Friday ad</a> shows the <a href="https://zdcs.link/dnYd5">6-quart Duo Nova</a>, the new-and-improved version of the best-selling Duo (now with an easier steam release mechanism) for $64.95. This matches its lowest price on Amazon ever, so it's highly likely that <a href="https://zdcs.link/M1Xvg">Amazon</a> will match this or go lower.</p>
      <p><b>Where to buy the Instant Pot Ultra:</b> Probably <a href="https://zdcs.link/65wx2">Amazon</a>. The highly-beloved <a href="https://zdcs.link/X5ldO">Instant Pot Ultra</a> was randomly up to <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/sept-20-instant-pot-ultra-amazon/">50% off in all three sizes in September</a>, so Amazon would have to slash the price <i>pretty</i> low if they want the Black Friday price to beat that. Your biggest competition is yourself, right?</p>
      <p><b>Where to buy the Instant Vortex Air Fryer:</b> Aw, baby's first Black Friday! Instant Pot's first air fryer was released in August 2019 and <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/deal-july-14-instant-vortex-plus/">hasn't been on sale for more than $20 off</a>. Walmart's ad scan shows the <a href="https://zdcs.link/5d7M5">6-quart Instant Vortex</a> on sale for $49, which is a generous $50 off the regular $99. Walmart currently has the <a href="https://zdcs.link/p8Vgv">10-quart Instant Vortex Plus</a> for $20 off at $99 and may drop it even more for Black Friday. The only other ad scan that mentions the Vortex is <a href="https://bestblackfriday.com/ads/macys-black-friday">Macy's</a>, where it will be $69.99.</p>
