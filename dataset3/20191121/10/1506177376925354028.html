      <p>Greek American actress Nia Vardalos together with The Hellenic Initiative, are supporting the SOS Babies Care Program this November for National Adoption Month, which is a reminder that every child deserves a safe, stable and loving home.</p>
      <h3>SOS CHILDREN’S VILLAGES GREECE</h3>
      <p>In February of 2017 SOS Children’s Villages Greece launched the SOS Babies Care program, which was designed with a dual goal: to immediately remove babies from the hospitals and to provide specialised adequate care; as well as to work on their rehabilitation in a family environment as soon as possible (foster care, adoption, support for their return to their biological families).</p>
      <p>Before this program, newborn babies that were abandoned in public maternity hospitals (30 babies per year on average) stayed without care for 6 months to a year. These babies were kept in a ward that was severely insufficient and even dangerous for their health, close to sick older children. They did not receive any care, were not even exposed to natural light, and as such developed significant problems in their development and health.</p>
