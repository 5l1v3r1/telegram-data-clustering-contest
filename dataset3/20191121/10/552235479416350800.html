      <h1>Five years from his death, we look back at Sammy Reid's amazing life.</h1>
      <h2>The Craigneuk man scored against Rangers to put them out of the cup in January 1967.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:49:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:49</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Pringle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/michael-pringle/</a></address>
      <p>Last week marked the fifth anniversary of the death of one of Wishaw’s most famous sons.</p>
      <p>Sammy Reid, who was born and bred in the town, scored the winning goal in what remains the biggest shock in the history of Scottish football.</p>
      <p>Sammy, who was born in Craigneuk on October 13, 1939, scored the only goal of the game when Berwick Rangers knocked their namesakes from Glasgow out of the Scottish Cup almost 53 years ago.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Wee Rangers’ victory in January 1967 is still considered by many as the biggest upset in Scottish football.</p>
      <p>It is also amongst the most famous of giant-killing acts in British footballing history.</p>
      <p>To put it in perspective, Glasgow Rangers went on to make it all the way to the European Cup Winners Cup final that season, where they narrowly lost out in extra time to a Bayern Munich side that was brimming with international stars such as Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Muller and Sepp Maier. It was Bayern’s first European trophy in their history.</p>
      <p>The big Rangers had already defeated holders Borussia Dortmund in the earlier rounds.</p>
      <p>While Sammy is best remembered throughout the country for his Scottish Cup goal that day in 1967, he was no stranger to beating Rangers.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The diminutive Sammy, who stood just 5ft 4ins tall, had kicked off his senior career at Motherwell, debuting against Airdrie as an 18-year-old in 1958 where he played in a fantastic team under manager Bobby Ancell. The side, known fondly as the Ancell Babes, beat Rangers four times in succession during one season in 1959/60.</p>
      <p>Well won home and away in both the league and league cup that season.</p>
      <p>Sammy’s displays didn’t go unnoticed in the wider footballing world and he became legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly’s first signing for a fee of around £8,000.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately the inside-right didn’t set the heather alight while in England and failed to make a first team appearance for the Reds after picking up an injury soon after his move.</p>
      <p>He returned home to Scotland and over the next six years had successful stints at both Falkirk and Clyde, during the latter spell playing alongside Harry Hood before his move to Celtic.</p>
      <p>Sammy, a time-served bricklayer, actually started the 1966/67 season still on Clyde’s books.</p>
      <p>He had been sidelined that season with a knee injury before moving south to Berwick’s Shielfield Park.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Clyde finished the season in third place behind the two Glasgow sides. Berwick finished mid-table in the second division.</p>
      <p>At the time there were only two divisions.</p>
      <p>Ironically, goalkeeper Jock Wallace was Berwick’s player-manager at the time of the Scottish Cup upset.</p>
      <p>The following season Sammy was consigned to the reserves by the future Rangers manager and moved on to play for Dumbarton.</p>
      <p>Sammy who had previously undergone heart surgery passed away at home in Wishaw on November 9, 2014.</p>
      <p>He was aged 75.</p>
