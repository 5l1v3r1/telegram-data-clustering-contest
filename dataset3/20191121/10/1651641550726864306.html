      <p>The Galaxy S11 is expected to Samsung’s first smartphone release in 2020. The S11 is rumored to be the best camera phone that Samsung has ever produced. Not only the camera but also other specs such as processor, battery, display are expected to be top-notch.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy S11 is also expected to be one of the best smartphones when it comes to taking the battery from 0 to 100 percent, because according to the famous leaker <i>Ice Universe</i>, the S11 5G has recently been certified with EP- TA800 charger that has support for 25W fast charging.</p>

      <p>The certification suggests that the Galaxy S11 and S11e will support the 25W fast charging, while the S11 Plus will have support for 45W fast charging much like the Galaxy Note 10 Plus.</p>
      <p>Rumors are also doing the rounds that Galaxy S11 is going to set a new benchmark for other major players in the smartphone industry. <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/more-details-about-the-camera-of-the-upcoming-galaxy-s11-leaks-online/">The smartphone will feature a huge 108MP camera sensor</a>, which will be capable of capturing 8K@30fps video. The company is also working on <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsung-camera-app-to-get-directors-view-mode-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-and-more/">plenty of new camera features</a> and these include Director’s View Mode, Night Hyperlapse, Single Take Photo, Vertical Panoramas, and custom filters.</p>
      <p>The S11 is also expected to be more pleasing to look at as bezel is going to be narrower than that of the Note 10 series of smartphones.</p>
      <p>Coming back to the display, Galaxy S11 is expected to <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/new-galaxy-s11-leak-reveals-surprising-details-about-the-display/">feature a display with a weird 20:9 aspect ratio</a>, slightly up from 19:9 on the Galaxy S10. The display of the S11 is also rumored to have <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/samsungs-upcoming-galaxy-s11-smartphone-might-have-a-120hz-display/">a 120 Hz refresh rate</a>. This will make the display look a lot like the one you find on the Galaxy A70 and Galaxy A80 as both A70 and A80 have a similar aspect ratio.</p>
