      <h2>David Bartram died last December</h2>

      <p>A Winshill man set to pay an amazing tribute to his "one-of-a-kind" brother after his death left "a hole" in his family's life.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/david-bartram-tribute-death-burton-2768753">David Bartram, who was known to his family and friends as Bert</a>, was 63 when he died after a short illness last year.</p>
      <p>His family said they had been left with a "massive hole" in their lives.</p>
      <p>Bert was well known <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/burton/smoker-died-fire-burton-milton-3558038">in Winshill</a> for his friendly nature and unique personality.</p>
      <p>Now, Bert's younger brother, Steve, also 63, will be following in his footsteps when he takes on a gruelling biking challenge in Cuba - a country that always had a special place in Bert's heart.</p>
      <p>Bert - one of six children - would often visit Cuba, but rather than heading to capital Havana and trying its world-famous cigars, he would travel to small villages and meet "real people".</p>

      <p>He worked with charities supporting Cubans and would give them essential items they no longer had access to due to the blockade implemented by the US after the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.</p>
      <p>Steve and Bert were very close and loved to watch live music together or go to see plays together. The duo went to Glastonbury 26 times.</p>
      <p>Dad-of-five Steve, said: "I lost my brother and best friend last December. He was truly one of kind and lived his life to the fullest.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if I would have done this if Bert hadn't passed away. I always did want to go to Cuba though, it was on our bucket list to go together, but we never got to fulfil that wish.</p>
      <p>"But now I'm going and doing the bike ride for Bert. It's all in his memory and it's thanks to him that I'm doing it and want to raise the money to help children in Cuba. It's for him; for Bertie."</p>
      <p>Steve's bike ride will raise funds for essential children's educational equipment, such as braille machines for blind children.</p>

      <p>The challenge will see Steve cycle 355km over five days, and he will travel 85km on the longest day.</p>
      <p>He added: "The hilly terrain and the temperatures are going to make it more difficult, I think, bearing in mind I'm only 18 months younger than Bert and he did it 15 years ago.</p>
      <p>"I am excited to do the same ride that he did though. It will be the exact same route, so I will be doing the exact same as he did years ago.</p>
      <p>"After the ride, we will have five days in Cuba, so I am going to meet the real people who live there - like Bert used to."</p>
      <p>While he is out there, Steve is also hoping to plant a tree in memory of Bert and create a memorial to him in Cuba.</p>
      <p>In October, Steve hosted a special Cuban night, with famous Cuban musician Omar Puente, at Tower Brewery, and and around 140 of Bert's friends and family all gathered to remember him.</p>
