      <h2>Chloe is getting better but fears she may have been left infertile</h2>

      <p>A young woman has told how a girls' trip to Magaluf saved her life when her friends noticed her anorexia - which had stopped her periods and caused her hair to fall out.</p>
      <p>Chloe Frame, 20, became so determined not to eat that she feared even using toothpaste would cause her to put on weight.</p>
      <p>At the height of her illness, Chloe weighed just six stone - and would eat one meal of 500 calories a day, while doing 25,000 steps to burn them off.</p>

      <p>Her periods stopped and her hair began to fall out, and she was only sleeping two hours a night.</p>
      <p>Chloe’s problems began aged 18 when her parents divorced, and she says she began to starve herself in a bid for attention.</p>

      <p>She became fixated with eating one 500 calorie meal a day and began obsessively calorie counting.</p>
      <p>But a girls holiday to Magaluf in June last year saved her life when her pals noticed how thin she was and told her parents.</p>

      <p>The university student, from Ayr, South Ayrshire, is now recovering with the help of private counselling - but feared her illness may have left her infertile.</p>
      <p>Chloe said: “When it started, my mum and dad were getting divorced and I wasn’t getting the attention I was used too.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I started becoming obsessed with food and thought if I lost weight maybe that would get me the attention from my family.</p>
      <p>“I started restricting what I was eating, I would eat three normal meals a day but just not overindulge.</p>
      <p>“But the weight wasn’t coming off quick enough.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“So I started starving myself all day and then allowed myself to eat one meal at night time which would be around 500 calories.</p>
      <p>“I would weigh everything out and find out exactly how many calories were in each thing so I could get it to 500.</p>
      <p>“Even when I brushed my teeth, I would only use a tiny bit of toothpaste because I was so worried it would make me put on weight.”</p>

      <p>As the illness took hold, Chloe developed a fear of supermarkets - and each trip would end up lasting three hours as she desperately searched for the lowest calorie foods.</p>
      <p>She began trawling online grocery stores in a bid to find foods with no calories.</p>
      <p>Chloe said: “I developed a phobia of supermarkets, I would find them totally overwhelming to be in.</p>
      <p>“I would spend three hours shopping looking at the calorie content of each thing to make sure I got the one with the least in it.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“When I started getting scared to go in them, I would sit at home instead, spending hours on my phone looking at their websites to find food with zero calories.</p>
      <p>“I think I was also taunting myself, looking at all the things I couldn’t have.</p>
      <p>“It was the same with restaurants, I was scared to eat out.</p>
      <p>“If my friends asked me to go for a meal, I would starve myself beforehand, and know the menu off by heart, so I knew exactly what I could get.</p>
      <p>“Even when I did eat, I would normally be sick right afterwards.</p>

      <p>“It was exhausting and I was always so hungry but the need to be thin kept me going.</p>
      <p>“I was so cold all the time, I was only sleeping for about two hours a night, my periods stopped and my hair fell out in massive clumps.</p>
      <p>“At one point I was constipated for four weeks.</p>
      <p>“I was so weak and tired but was still trying to do 25,000 steps a day while eating no food.</p>
      <p>“I would say ‘I will stop when I get to this weight’, but then when I reached it, I would just keep going.</p>
      <p>“Then people started noticing I had lost weight and it felt amazing."</p>

      <p>But an intervention finally came following a boozy holiday to Magaluf - when Chloe restricted her eating even further to allow for calories from her alcohol consumption.</p>
      <p>She said: “When we went on holiday to Magaluf I was drinking so I really tried not to eat anything at all because I was so determined to stay thin.</p>
      <p>“But my friends started noticing, so one of the days I ate three chicken nuggets and was sick right away because I just couldn’t live with the guilt.</p>
      <p>“When we got home my friends told my parents and that's when I knew I had to make a change.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“The holiday saved my life because that’s when my friends started noticing.</p>
      <p>“I was a really bubbly and happy person, who always enjoyed food, no one could believe this happened to me.”</p>
      <p>Last July she began seeing a counsellor, and she has now returned to a healthy weight and is enrolled on a course at Glasgow Caledonian University.</p>

      <p>She said: “My periods only came back two months ago and I was really worried that I was going to be infertile.</p>
      <p>“I had to cut my hair into a bob because it was so thin, and then get extensions to try and make it look thicker because I lost so much.</p>
      <p>“But the counselling has helped me cope and I no longer have anxiety and depression because of my eating disorder.</p>

      <p>“I still eat a healthy diet but I don’t weigh myself anymore.</p>
      <p>"The thoughts can sometimes be there but it’s gradually getting better.”</p>
