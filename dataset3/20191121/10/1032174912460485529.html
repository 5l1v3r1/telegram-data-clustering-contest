      <p>Since opening in 2017, North Street Store has taken the Perth bread scene by storm. In the 2019 Perth Royal Food Awards it won four gold medals, two champion awards for its baguettes and was declared “most successful bread exhibitor”. You’re likely to encounter a queue whenever you visit its Cottesloe corner store.</p>
      <p>So it came as no surprise when owners Lachlan Bisset and Craig Stewart announced they were building a new bakery – in North Fremantle – to help cope with demand. Little Loaf Bakery is the interim store, before a bigger one gets built.</p>
      <p>Located in the old <a href="https://www.broadsheet.com.au/perth/fremantle/shops/wild-bakery">Wild Bakery</a> premises, around the corner from pizza restaurant L’Antica, Little Loaf is a truly blink-and-you’ll-miss-it joint. You’ll wonder if you’re in the right place, but behind the tiny retail frontage is a substantial bakery.</p>
      <p>The shop is self-service, which is entirely appropriate for its size and location and helps keep costs down. A selection of cakes, pastries and continental rolls make an appearance alongside the store’s legendary bread. For sweeter options the strawberry tarts, cinnamon scrolls and vanilla slices are hard to resist. Karvan coffee is offered in two different batch brews.</p>
      <p>North Street Store’s dinner service is also worth trying. The three-dish menu changes daily and ranges from pasta and curries to porchetta and schnitzel.</p>
