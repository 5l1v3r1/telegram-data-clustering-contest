      <p>A woman of Pakistani descent who works as a beautician in Saudi Arabia was arrested after a video of her ‘catcalling’ men on a street went viral.</p>
      <p>The incident took place in Jeddah’s Corniche, according to Saudi news outlet <i><a href="https://www.okaz.com.sa/article/1757049/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA/%D8%A5%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81-%D9%81%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%A8-%D9%83%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%B4-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D8%A9">Okaz</a>.</i></p>
      <p>The woman was filmed sitting in the backseat of a car, smoking what appears to be an electronic cigarette, and catcalling men through an open window of the car.</p>
      <p>The video of the incident was initially shared on Snapchat after which it also began doing the rounds on Twitter.</p>

      <p>In the video, the woman can be heard and seen speaking in Arabic, though authorities have since said that she is of Pakistani origin.</p>
      <p>As the video rolls on, the woman in question makes comments regarding men walking by. At one instance, she is heard saying “If her abaya was pretty, I would’ve flirted with her” as a woman passes by.</p>
      <p>Sources speaking to Okaz said the woman and her friend escaped to Madinah amid the backlash generated by the footage.</p>
      <p>She was, nevertheless, detained in Madinah and referred to legal authorities in Jeddah.</p>
      <p>Before her arrest, accounts on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KSA/status/1197185079568670721?s=20">circulated a video</a> claiming it featured the woman’s apology.</p>
      <p>In it, she is heard crying while saying she “didn’t intend to offend anyone with her actions”.</p>
      <p>The accuracy and veracity of the footage being attributed to her remains unconfirmed.</p>
      <p>The incident polarised Saudis the moment it was made public and people’s reactions to it continued to pour in after the defendant’s detainment.</p>
      <p>Many were <a href="https://twitter.com/998Ros/status/1197305733844328448?s=20">relieved</a> action was taken against her because they felt what she did “violated the kingdom’s rules and regulations”.</p>
