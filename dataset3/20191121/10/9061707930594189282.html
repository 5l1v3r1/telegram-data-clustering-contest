      <h1>Plans for new £4 million primary school revealed</h1>
      <h2>The new school would be more energy efficient</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:56:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:56</time> by <a rel="author">Eddie Bisknell</a></address>
      <p>Plans for a new £4 million primary school have been submitted for a Derbyshire village.</p>
      <p>The application, filed by <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derbyshire-county-council">Derbyshire County Council</a> to itself, would see a new 120-space primary school built in Brookside Road, Breadsall.</p>
      <p>In January, the council announced its plans to switch from refurbishing its former pupil referral unit in Breadsall Road to become a <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/education">primary school</a>, to demolishing it instead.</p>
      <p>This was to “provide a better solution for the school in terms of delivering education”.</p>
      <p>On top of this, it is thought that the refurbished option would not bring the site up to modern standards, due to the restrictions of trying to fit a school within a building which was not built to be used as one.</p>
      <p>It ultimately chose to make the switch due to rising costs caused by “serious vandalism” of the former PRU site and “significant problems” with the building, including unforeseen asbestos.</p>
      <p>A new build is thought to be more energy efficient, which would keep running costs down.</p>
      <p>The overall new build would cost about £4 million.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the council’s former behavioural support centre, which had shared the same site in Brookside Road, has already been knocked down.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Derbyshire County Council approved plans to spend £4.75 million to move the pupil referral unit from Brookside Road to a building in Ilkeston.</p>
      <p>In the second half of the project, Breadsall Primary School, currently located in Moor Road, west of the cricket club, was to be moved into a section of the vacated PRU building, just a few hundred metres to the south-east, at a cost of £1.75 million.</p>

      <p>However, in 2017, this cost rose to £2.2 million.</p>
      <p>Issues with fixing vandalism and asbestos were due to require an extra £1.3 million.</p>
      <p>Switching from refurbishment to building a brand new school would cost £1.8 million, the council said in January.</p>
      <p>It also said this included £300,000 in “abortive fees” to cover design work which has already been carried out for the initial refurbishment plan.</p>
      <p>A statement submitted with the application says: “The proposed development would enable Breadsall Church of England Primary School to relocate from its existing site to this larger site.</p>
      <p>“The scheme will create an exciting learning environment that will be accessible to all. The buildings have been designed to minimise energy consumption and incorporate features to save a significant amount of CO2.</p>
      <p>“The development will also offer a new hard play area a playing field and resurfaced games courts.”</p>
      <p>The plans for the new school include two hard-surfaced sports courts, a playing field, additional hard play area, trim trail, wild flower meadow, and separate play areas for early years/foundation pupils and infants.</p>
      <p>In total, 14 parking spaces would be created for the school along with two spots for disabled users.</p>
      <p>The council said in a report in January: “The current Breadsall Primary School building is an old Victorian building with a significant maintenance backlog.</p>
      <p>“Whilst the refurbishment option on the Brookside Road site would provide a more modern building and access to playing fields, it would not have brought facilities into line with current guidelines in terms of room and kitchen sizes, width of circulation and full accessibility.</p>
      <p>“Whilst the cost of the abortive fees is unfortunate, it is felt that the new build option would provide a better solution for the school in terms of delivering education, removing further doubt about the fitness and cost of the refurbishment, and providing an efficient building that will cost less to run in the future.”</p>
