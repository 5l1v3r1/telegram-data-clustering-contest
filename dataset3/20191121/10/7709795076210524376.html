        <b>Judicial is set to make his next public appearance at Lingfield on Good Friday, after landing a fast-track qualifier for the all-weather championships at the Surrey venue.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The seven-year-old overcame his wide draw to take the Listed Golden Rose Stakes in emphatic fashion - proving he has no problem staying the six furlongs.</p>
      <p>Steve Brown, assistant to his wife, trainer Julie Camacho, said: "It was visually very impressive. It couldn't have worked out any better for us.</p>
      <p>"We were a little pessimistic with the draw, but he managed to overcome that - and it was a good performance from him.</p>
      <p>"It seemed to suit. We didn't have too many options. He was up in trip and he saw it out well over the easy six. We were really pleased - it was a nice end to his season."</p>
      <p>Judicial has earned a holiday before being prepared for his next target on April 10.</p>
      <p>"I imagine he'll go down to the owners' place for a month's break and hope to get him back in similar form for the final of the all-weather championships on Good Friday," added Brown.</p>
      <p>"I think we'll go straight there. We've always got the option of going away for a gallop and stretch his legs on the synthetics, so that's a possibility.</p>
      <p>"He's not a horse you have to work hard with to get fit. He's a pretty straightforward horse these days. We just might give him a breeze two of three weeks before to blow the cobwebs away.</p>
      <p>"He's been fantastic for us, and we love him dearly."</p>
