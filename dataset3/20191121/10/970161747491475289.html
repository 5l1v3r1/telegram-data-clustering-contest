      <p>Turns out the I’m a Celebrity campsite is smaller than even the campmates realise – with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacqueline-jossa/">Jacqueline Jossa</a> getting awkwardly confronted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/andrew-maxwell/">Andrew Maxwell</a> after he overheard her talking about him.</p>
      <p>The EastEnders star spoke to Ian Wright and James Haskell about their bushtucker trial from the day before, where she overcame her fears as her head was surrounded by spiders, and admitted she felt pressured by Andrew while doing it.</p>
      <p>Speaking with the sportsmen about motivation when trying to complete something, Jacqueline said: ‘I wouldn’t want to be the one coming back with nothing. I was panicking so much yesterday.’</p>

      <p>‘It didn’t make it better people going if you don’t even try we’re going to get nothing,’ she said. ‘That doesn’t make it better.  It makes it ten times worse.</p>
      <p>‘In fact it made me want to go I’m not doing it.  If someone can’t do it, they can’t do it.’</p>
      <p>Listening in on the conversation, Andrew then chimed in and said: ’That was me you were talking about?’</p>
      <p>Admitting to him that it was, the Ex On The Beach voiceover told her: ‘I’d just been through a really horrific thing but I didn’t want to put pressure on you.’</p>

      <p>‘I won’t do that again,’ he added. ‘We’re all still learning on the job.’</p>
      <p>Awkward.</p>
      <p>The conversation came up as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/im-a-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-uses-the-spirit-of-jane-mcdonald-to-wolf-down-camel-anus-and-vomit-fruit-in-foul-bushtucker-trial-11190226/">Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts took on the first eating Bushtucker trial of the series</a>, Just Desserts.</p>

      <p>Ian Wright, who’s been struggling with the camp’s meagre rations, was seen desperate for the pair to come up with the goods in order for the team to get a decent meal.</p>
      <p>‘The meal that we had yesterday [Monday], we’re only going to get stuff like that if people step up and that’s all you can ask people to do,’ he said.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Step up, do your best so I’m confident they’re going to do well.’</p>
      <p>After taking one for the team, the pair had to take on camel anus and vomit fruit among the foul collection of meals – but managed to bring home all 10 stars for the first time this series.</p>
