        <b>This is Why You Don’t Mess With Nandos For Attention</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Nandos_zw/status/1197236418189438977?s=20">A Parody Nandos Zimbabwe</a> Account just hit back at a customer who was on a rant about poor services at one of their Fast Food Outlets in Harare. Taking to Social Media the angry customer lambasted the Nandos branch for never having anything.</p>
      <aside>Nandos Sam Levy is the worst!! They never have anything. I went on Wednesday, they had no fries. I went today with 15 of my mates, they had no water and couldn’t serve us!! Never go there!! Such a waste of time!! Mxm #Nandoszw #Nandos @RebelzUnlimited @NandosZimbabwe @NandosSA</aside>
      <p>Without Saying much, Nandos responded and silenced the angry customer…..</p>
      <aside>We remember you, you didn’t buy anything, you just came in to use the toilet. Shame on you!!!!</aside>
      <p>Now that’s savage….What’s your opinion, did Nandos not go too far?</p>
