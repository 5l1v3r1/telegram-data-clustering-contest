      <p>Curtis Jackson is back on IG.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Earlier this year, former G-Unit comrades 50 Cent and Young Buck were engaged in a feud on the internet. Part of 50’s Instagram attack involved claiming that Buck was attracted to transgender women.</p>
      <p>Fiddy is back at it again. Yesterday, the <i>Power </i>executive producer took another shot at his ex-protégé on IG. 50 Cent posted a meme of two people embracing each other with the header “He Doesn’t Know Yet.” 50’s separate caption suggested the picture was of a man with a trans woman. It read, “👀buck type sh*t, nah he know. LOL😆#lecheminduroi #bransoncogna.”</p>
      <p>In May, DJ Mister Cee, an NYC radio personality who was arrested several times for soliciting trans prostitution, <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/50-cent-reacts-to-dj-mister-cee-advising-young-buck-on-transgender-dating-rumors-Q3KwIy7iWEuGqGVgnsEdrQ/">offered advice to Young Buck</a> about dating transgender women. He stated, “What I want to tell you, Young Buck, is whether your situation is true or not, that's not what I'm here for. I'm here to kind of give you a little bit of guidance to what I think you need to do."</p>
      <p>50 Cent reacted to Mister Cee’s message. The 44-year-old entertainer posted on Instagram, "👀yo the funny sh*t is @djmistercee help me, after I got hit he booked the first show we did at club speed. 🤐I got nothing bad to say."</p>
