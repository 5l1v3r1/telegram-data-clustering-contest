      <h1>Marvel's Star Wars May Answer a Lingering Question From The Force Awakens</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:11:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p>One of several mysteries set up in 2015's <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</i> was how Maz Kanata came into possession of the iconic Skywalker lightsaber. However, in Marvel's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> #3 by Charles Soule and Jesus Saiz, we may finally get our answer.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-solicitations-february-2020/">Marvel's solicitation</a> text for the upcoming issue, "LUKE SKYWALKER’S only hope at becoming a JEDI KNIGHT was lost during his battle with DARTH VADER…and so he, PRINCESS LEIA and LANDO CALRISSIAN must return to CLOUD CITY to find it!" This seemingly indicates he'll venture back to Bespin to seek out the lightsaber he lost when Darth Vader severed his hand during their duel.</p>

      <p>After losing the Jedi weapon that once belonged to Anakin, Luke constructed a new lightsaber with a green kyber crystal. However, the blue-bladed one that was gifted to him by Obi-Wan Kenobi in <i>A New Hope</i> made a return in <i>The Force Awakens</i> when it called out to Rey from the basement of Maz's castle. Then, when Han Solo asked her where she got it, Maz simply said, "A good question -- for another time," leaving fans wondering when exactly this plot point would be addressed.</p>
