      <p>Campaigners around Horsehay Pool had been planning to protest the eyesore wall, but work has now started on repairing it.</p>
      <p>Telford &amp; Wrekin Council said its contractors began the work on Monday, and that it was expected to take about four weeks to complete.</p>
      <p>Russell Griffin, a spokesman for Telford &amp; Wrekin Council, said: "A large tree fell into Horsehay Pool in October 2018 after high winds and damaged part of the Reservoir dam wall.</p>
      <p>"Works started to permanently repair the damage on Monday, November 18 and these are expected to be completed in four weeks.</p>
      <p>"Balfour Beatty is the principal contractor for the works and specialist local sub-contractors are being used to install scaffolding and rebuild the wall using locally sourced materials."</p>
      <h3>Ruins</h3>
      <p>The dam wall was left in ruins after a tree smashed through it during Storm Callum in October 2018.</p>
      <p>The tree that crashed through the wall was cut down and the area was secured, but the beauty spot was then left untouched.</p>
      <p>The council said that work had been going on behind the scenes on the difficult project, which was delayed in part by a suspended BT duct.</p>
      <p>It said it was not a simple quick job because it involved the historic dam wall, the open water of Horsehay pool and nearby buried services.</p>
      <p>The pool was created when Abraham Darby II build a blast furnace in the area.</p>
      <p>It is believed to be the original pool from which water was drawn to operate the blast furnace. Many large scale projects were created in Horsehay, including the Shifnal railway bridge.</p>
      <p>Many of the homes next to the pool were built for workers at the furnace.</p>
