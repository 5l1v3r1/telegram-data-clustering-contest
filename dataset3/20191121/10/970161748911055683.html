        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/joe-warren-plant/">Joe-Warren Plant</a>) is about to get a serious wake up call over his recent appalling behaviour in Emmerdale when Liam Cavanagh (Jonny McPherson) discovers that he slept with Leanna (Mimi Slinger) before walking out on her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After Jacob took Leanna’s virginity while still having his mind messed up by the release of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein), <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-jacob-maya-pregnant-age-leanna-return-11187552/">she was confused and hurt when he was cold and distant with her before leaving straight after the act.</a></p>
      <p>Later on, she was further taken aback when he sent a blunt text asking if she is on the pill. Tonight, after Leanna implies that Jacob put pressure on her to have sex, Liam takes this as an allegation amounting to sexual assault and he is on the warpath.</p>
      <p>He bursts into the shop and attacks Jacob, hitting him and ranting at him for his deplorable behaviour. As David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) can’t believe his ears over what has happened, the situation spirals out of control and Liam ends up being arrested.</p>

      <p>As news of Jacob’s selfish behaviour spreads, he will find himself isolated – but what consequences will there be for Liam as he is charged with assault? Could he lose his job as a GP as a result of his altercation with Jacob?</p>
      <p>And will the trouble serve as a wake up call to Jacob that he is out of control and has issues he needs to address, given that he is hurting those around him?</p>
      <p>The situation is more complicated still as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">it was recently confirmed on her release that Maya is pregnant with a baby</a> that could be Jacob’s or David’s. However, Emmerdale confirmed to Metro.co.uk that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/emmerdale-spoilers-no-return-planned-for-maya-stepney-amid-pregnancy-twist-11184975/">there are no current plans for the character to return</a> so that seems to be a bombshell for a later date.</p>
