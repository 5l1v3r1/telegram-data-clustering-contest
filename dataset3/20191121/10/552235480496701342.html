      <p>A community council has imploded with a raft of resignations.</p>
      <p>The blow has all but put Kirkoswald, Maidens and Turnberry Community Council out of business.</p>
      <p>Chairman Mike Savage is the Director of Estates Cassillis &amp; Culzean Estates and he has resigned.</p>
      <p>Vice chairman John Barr - a former chairman - confirmed he’d stepped down.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t want to talk about the specifics. I have done it for all these years and thought enough is enough.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t mind standing in for the odd meeting, but there was no way I was taking over again.”</p>
      <p>It is believed a build-up of pressure - among other things - over the open market sale by South Ayrshire Council of the Richmond Hall in Kirkoswald - had been the trigger for some of the resignations.</p>
      <p>Kirkoswald, Maidens and Turnberry Community Council is understood to have come under flack for not getting involved in a community asset transfer of the Richmond.</p>
      <p>Sources say it was offered the option to take over under an official asset transfer, but did not initially do so.</p>
      <p>The arts and crafts-style B listed hall was built in 1924 and South Ayrshire Council is seeking bids on the open market.</p>
      <p>It was actually gifted to the community and could now end up in private hands.</p>
      <p>The benefactor was John Richmond who had the same top architect James Miller build his mansion, nearby Blanefield House.</p>
      <p>Ex Chairman Savage failed to speak and hung up the phone. He also failed to respond to a voice message seeking clarification.</p>
      <p>Former Community Councillor John Dunlop was also coy about the reason for his departure.</p>
      <p>He refused to say if treasurer Leslie McFadzean had also stood down. Mr McFadzean was unavailable for comment.</p>
      <p>Asked if KMTC was now out of business, Mr Dunlop replied: “I really cannot comment on that, I have put my resignation in.”</p>
      <p>And asked if the sale of Richmond was to blame, he added: “There has just been a build-up of things.”</p>
