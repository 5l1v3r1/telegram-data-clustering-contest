      <p>Sri Lanka’s newly-elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has sworn in as prime minister his brother and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, capping a victorious return to power of the siblings credited with a military victory over Tamil rebels – but also implicated in human rights violations.</p>
      <p>Ranil Wickremesinghe stepped down as prime minister earlier on Thursday to clear the way for the president to form his government.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement that he was quitting despite having a parliamentary majority, respecting the mandate Gotabaya Rajapaksa received in last Saturday’s presidential election.</p>
      <p>A refusal to resign could have resulted in a stalemate because the president cannot sack the prime minister or appoint ministers without his advice.</p>

      <p>Mahinda Rajapaksa is widely applauded with ending a 26-year separatist civil war with ethnic Tamil rebels during his presidency from 2005 to 2015. His brother the current president then served as a powerful secretary to the Ministry of Defence.</p>
      <p>In a boost to his grip on power, a court on Thursday discharged President Rajapaksa in a corruption case, citing constitutional provisions for presidential immunity. The decision was made on the advice of the attorney general, spokeswoman Nishara Jayaratne said.</p>
      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa had been charged with misappropriating almost £150,000 in state funds to build a monument for his parents.</p>
      <p>He was also implicated in several investigations including the abduction and killing of critical journalists during the civil war.</p>
      <p>Ms Jayaratne said that according to the constitution, no legal case, civil or criminal, can be filed against the president.</p>
