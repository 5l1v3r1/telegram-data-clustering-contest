        <b>TT Electronics has announced the latest series to be added to its green thick-film chip portfolio – the GBCN, a thick-film chip array which is free of Pb (lead) and lead compounds.</b>
      </p>
      <p>As environmental regulations become increasingly stringent, the GBCN series allows designers to achieve exemption-free compliance with the EU’s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive.  </p>

      <p>The resistors provide pull-up, pull-down, level shift and termination functions in digital circuits and compact analogue circuits found in equipment such as process controllers, body control modules and medical devices.</p>
      <p>“TT Electronics is committed to providing our customers future-proof designs that remove reliance on RoHS exemptions,” said Barry Peters, VP product management and engineering, TT Electronics. “GBCN and the rest of our Green portfolio enable OEMs to safeguard their system design investments and avoid time-consuming re-spins or, worse, extensive design alterations.”</p>
      <p>The GBCN series is a single-component, AEC-Q200 qualified product, containing an array of four isolated resistor elements in a compact 1206 total footprint which results in faster assembly.</p>
      <p>The manufacturer has previously released two other green thick-film series: the GHVC (green thick-film high-voltage resistor) and GWCR (green thick-film chip resistor).</p>
