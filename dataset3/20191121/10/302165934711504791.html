      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Malaysian Resources Corporation Bhd (MRCB) recorded lower revenue of RM847.8 million in the first nine months of 2019 compared to RM1.5 billion in the corresponding period last year.</p>
      <p>During the period, net profit also declined to RM11.37 million from RM76.34 million previously, it said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>In a separate statement, MRCB attributed its performance to the significant high-rise residential property projects still being in their early phase of construction when revenue recognition is very minimal.</p>
      <p>It added that a majority of the completed residential units sold during the period have yet to be recognised due to the pending completion of sales and purchase.</p>
      <p>Group managing director Imran Salim said that it has been a challenging year in terms of the timing of revenue and profit recognition.</p>
      <p>“These results mask the real progress we have made in 2019 and our RM1.7 billion unbilled property sales, which will begin to produce results in 2020.</p>
      <p>“Income recognition from the Light Rail Transit Line 3 project was also considerably lower during the period as a result of its re-timing and remodelling from a project delivery partner to a fixed price turnkey project,” he said.</p>
      <p>As of Sept 30, 2019, MRCB’s unbilled construction order book stood at RM20.9 billion.</p>
      <p>During the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, MRCB posted a net profit of RM2.52 million in the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, compared with RM19.79 million in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Revenue dropped to RM372.74 million from RM663.75 million previously.</p>
      <p>Moving forward, MRCB said its engineering, construction and environment division will continue to vie for more contracting projects to replenish its order book.</p>
      <p>As at Sept 30, 2019, the division’s external client order book stood at RM22.3 billion, which is amongst the highest in the industry.</p>
      <p>“This will ensure that the division has a steady pipeline of contracts to sustain its business. — Bernama</p>
