        <b>Abuse inquiry: Survivor rejects Church leader's 'minimising' of Michael Shirres attack</b>
      </p>
      <p>A Catholic leader newly appointed to the church's liaison group to the royal commission is accused of telling a survivor the priest who abused her had been "healing his sexuality".</p>

      <p>Anne Hill of Northland was preyed on from the age of five by Michael Shirres, a Pākehā priest who lectured in Māori theology at the University of Auckland, wrote several books on Māori spirituality, and was celebrated for decades among tangata whenua in the Far North.</p>
      <p>At the Royal Commission hearing in Auckland this month she had a conversation with Rangi Davis, who was newly-appointed to the Catholics' Te Rōpū Tautoko group that liases with the Commission.</p>
      <p>"We then had a conversation about the issues around abuse, and my abuser Michael Shirres from the Dominican Order," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Hill said she did not know Ms Davis was on Te Rōpū at the time.</p>
      <p>"She offered me some comfort. And that comfort was to say that she believed that he was healing his sexuality with women."</p>
      <p>All of the group's members have access to survivors' files. Ms Hill said she did not know if Ms Davis knew she had been abused by Shirres.</p>
      <p>"There was nothing in this interaction that was mistaken. I asked her if I could put my hand into her vagina to 'heal' myself. She shook herself and indicated that that would not be okay."</p>
      <p>Ms Hill first raised the alarm about the late priest - who was demoted to Brother after admitting his offending - 26 years ago.</p>

      <p>The Church quietly put him into treatment in 1993; his crimes were only <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=12094473">made public last year</a>.</p>
      <p>Ms Hill said Ms Davis' view epitomised Catholic leaders' excusing and minimising attitude of sex abuse.</p>
      <p>"I then went on to try to explain to her that this is not a case of a good man doing a bad thing ... this is a case of a very bad man doing very bad things.</p>
      <p>"There was a myth around Shirres, that his behaviour was to do with women, because there were some women involved. But this creates an ambivalence - where, in Davis's mind, are the children and non-consenting and vulnerable adults?"</p>
      <p>Ms Davis was a house parent at Hato Petera, a Māori boarding school in Auckland, for 13 years to 2001, during a period when two male teachers were sexually abusing boys; they were <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=186204">later</a> <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/crime/4135298/Jail-for-sex-abusing-ex-principal">convicted</a>.</p>
      <p>Ms Davis should be removed from Te Rōpū Tautoko, Ms Hill said, but said being understood was her deepest desire.</p>
      <p>"If the Rōpū understand us perhaps they will work for us, rather than for the Church and the commission. Are we not the children of the church?"</p>
      <p>Rangi Davis has not responded to multiple requests for comment.</p>
      <p>Te Rōpū Tautoko chair Catherine Fyfe declined an interview and instead issued a statement saying Ms Hill had raised the matter with them, and they acknowledged her concerns.</p>
      <p>"I have spoken with the member of Tautoko about her conversation with Ms Hill," Ms Fyfe wrote.</p>
      <p>"She is deeply sorry that their conversation has caused such distress, and has offered her profound apologies.</p>
      <p>"We have offered to Anne that the member would like to apologise to her directly, but only if Anne wishes that to occur."</p>
      <p>Ms Hill rejected any apology without real change, and without the Church addressing the deep betrayal of Māori by Father Shirres and those who covered up for him.</p>
      <p>"To some extent, I see Ms Davis as a victim, and that is probably why I'm so upset," she said.</p>
      <p>"Here is the first Māori woman I speak to about this issue. And she's actually responding like a victim - I recognise it; we used to think about it as thinking that we were so lucky that that Pa Shirres loved us."</p>
      <p>A Royal Commission spokesperson said it had no say in who the Church appointed to Te Ropu.</p>
