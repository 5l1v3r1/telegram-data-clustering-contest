      <h1>Update: House Panel Approves Bill to Decriminalize Marijuana Federally</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:12:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:12</time> by <a rel="author">VladTV</a></address>
      <p>Update 11/21/2019 9:51am:</p>
      <p>The House Judiciary Committee <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259082/lawmakers-set-to-vote-in-congress-to-federally-legalize-marijuana">voted on Wednesday</a> (November 20) 24-10 in favor of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act, or MORE, which would remove marijuana from the list of controlled substances federally. The bill would also expunge records of low-level marijuana offenses and allow VA doctors to prescribe marijuana to veterans for anxiety, depression, PTSD, and pain management. </p>
      <p>While many are applauding the House for approving the bill, it was also introduced in seven other House committees that could alter the outcome. The legislation's primary sponsor, Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., also explained why he doesn't think the Senate will pass the bill "as is." He added, "When the House passes a bill, it's part of a continuing process. It's not the end of a process." </p>

      <p>Original 11/20/2019 9:54am:</p>
      <p>Congress is set to vote this week to removing cannabis from the confines of the Controlled Substances Act, which will decriminalize it at the federal level and enable states to set their policies. The House Judiciary Committee will debate bill HR 3884, called the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act as early as Wednesday (November 20), or shortly thereafter. </p>
      <p>The MORE Act, co-sponsored by Sen. Kamala Harris and House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler, will also allow people with low-level cannabis convictions the opportunity to have their records cleared. Communities that were impacted by the failed "war on drugs" will also be given grants and funding, while doctors at VA facilities will be able to recommend cannabis to veterans suffering from PTSD, pain management and anxiety. The proposal currently has 55 co-sponsors and while some believe that it will receive a fair shot from Congress, while others are skeptical of the Senate passing the bill. </p>
