      <h1>We need surplus to pay down debt, says Scott Morrison</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:39:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/newdaily/" target="_blank">The New Daily</a></address>
      <p>Scott Morrison has ruled out running a deficit to stimulate the economy, insisting Australia not risk its budget surplus.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister has warned against making rash decisions after the government brought forward $3.8 billion for road and rail projects.</p>
      <p>“The surplus is not money left down the back of the couch with no economic purpose, it pays down debt,” he told the ABC’s <i>AM</i> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The coalition government came under intense pressure to bring forward spending on infrastructure, with big business, the central bank, economists and the opposition calling for faster cash.</p>
      <p>But Mr Morrison said the decision wasn’t based on a “phone call over the weekend”.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t rush around with our arms flapping in the air in some sort of panic crisis as the Labor Party wanted us to do,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We just took the sober, calm, methodical approach and got the projects ready.”</p>
      <p>While there are suggestions more needs to be done to stimulate the economy, the prime minister says sacrificing the surplus is off the table.</p>
      <p>“It’s critically important for Australia’s future financial resilience,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You just don’t go and erode all of your financial resources at a time like this. You make measured and careful decisions.”</p>
      <p>Labor frontbencher Tanya Plibersek said bringing infrastructure spending forward proved the opposition’s claims the economy was in trouble.</p>
      <p>“What’s not clear from yesterday’s announcement in the profile of the spending – when the money will start to be spent, when it will make a difference to the economy,” she told Sky News.</p>
      <p>“It’s not clear which projects are shovel-ready, which ones are years off in the never-never.”</p>
      <p>Mr Morrison said the United Kingdom, Germany and South Korea had negative economic growth in the most recent quarter, while Australia was up 1.4 per cent.</p>
