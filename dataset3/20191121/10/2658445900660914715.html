      <p>Lagos State government Thursday held a-one day seminar to train over 300 driving school instructors operating in the state towards enhancing best practices for drivers and reduce road traffic accidents.</p>
      <p>The seminar organised by the Lagos State Drivers’ Institute (LASDRI) has as its theme: ‘Enhancing best practice for driving school instructors in Lagos state’.</p>
      <p>Declaring the seminar open, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Transportation, Mr. Sewedo Oluseyi Whenu said training, retraining and recertification of drivers is germane towards ensuring road safety culture in Lagos state and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>“The seminar is designed to equip you all as the first line drivers’ instructors with necessary skills that will have cross effects on safe driving in the state; you are saddled with the responsibility of building confidence that will match the driving challenges of the state”.</p>
      <p>He told them that they are expected to teach road designs and automobile apparatus in their schools and that the seminar is organised to review the curriculum/templates they use in their various driving schools with the aim of adopting a uniform template towards Y2019/2020 training year.</p>

      <p>He urged the instructors to partner with the state government by upholding the mission of safe driving for safer roads in the state, charging them to “desist from activit Lagosies capable of endangering other road users.</p>
      <p>“Usage of rickety/distressed vehicles that are not road worthy for training is bad, change all your off road training vehicles to sound ones that still have all the auto parts intact, the breaking system must be in good condition to avoid the danger of road crashes,” the Perm Sec said.</p>
      <p>In her welcome address earlier, Acting General Manager of LASDRI, Mrs. Afusat Tiamiyu said the goal of the initiative is to reduce road traffic accident and set standards for driving schools across the state.</p>
      <p>According to her, the administration of Governor Sanwo-Olu “is resolute in making sanity prevail on our roads….with the mandate of ensuring adequate, efficient and effective road infrastructure and personnel in line with global best practice which is the reason for the training.</p>
      <p>“We at the institute find it imperative for all driving school instructors to undergo refresher training which is expected to enhance safe driving with adequate trendy safety practice,” Tiamiyu said.</p>
