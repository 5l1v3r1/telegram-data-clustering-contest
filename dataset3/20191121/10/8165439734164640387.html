      <h3>Missed out on I'm A Celeb last night?</h3>
      <h4>Here's what our celeb campmates got up to.</h4>
      <p>The hanger's starting to show as Adele and Roman gear up to take on the Just Desserts eating Trial.</p>
      <p>While their fellow Celebs' intentions are good, Jacqueline's not impressed by the pressure some of the Campmates put on the nervous pair.</p>
      <p>Is trouble brewing in Camp?</p>

      <p>Victory is extra sweet for Adele and Roman as they stomach a concoction of horrific desserts in the first eating Trial of the series.</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec save the best (or worst) for last as Roman chews on bull's penis, while Adele successfully swallows camel's anus to take home 10 stars to a hungry Camp.</p>

      <p>They survived Snake Rock, but life in Main Camp as a full cohort of big personalities is proving tough for some of our Campmates and the reality of life without luxury starts to bite.</p>
      <p>Having earlier vocalised his hunger, Ian isn't impressed when Andrew pushes him to have a second helping of dinner.</p>
      <p>Are the cracks starting to show?</p>

      <p>Kate Garraway and Myles Stephenson in giant pigeon costumes in the middle of the Australian Outback? Absolutely.</p>
      <p>The pair find themselves with egg on their face as they struggle to get to grips with the Dingo Dollar Challenge.</p>
      <p>But after getting in a flap, Myles swoops in and saves the day to unlock those dollars.</p>
