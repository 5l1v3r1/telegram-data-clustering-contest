      <p>Buckingham Palace this morning confirmed that Prince Andrew will continue to work on his Pitch@Palace initiative, as was first reported by <i>City A.M. </i>last night.</p>
      <p>A source close to Pitch@Palace told <i>City A.M. </i>that it was "business as usual" at the programme, which connects entrepreneurs with investors.</p>
      <p>This morning a number of businesses have expressed their support for the scheme, as the Duke was urged to give evidence to US authorities.</p>
      <p>It comes after the Duke announced he would step back from public duties for the foreseeable future.</p>
