      <p>A Burton business is offering aid to any household impacted by the devastating floods that hit the area last week.</p>
      <p>Bosses at Mick's Carpets, in <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">Curzon Street, Burton</a>, has vowed to give free rugs and offer discounts for new carpeting to those who have suffered.</p>
      <p>It comes after torrential rainfall throughout Thursday, November 14, that saw homes flooded and streets underwater across Burton and South Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>And it was the story of pensioner Carol Checkett that caught the attention of Caroline Heath, of Mick's Carpets.</p>
      <p>She said Mrs Checkett, who was forced out of <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/repton">her Repton home</a>, in Brook End, was a long-time customer of theirs.</p>
      <p>Many of her belongings were wrecked when eight inches of water seeped into the ground floor.</p>
      <p>Mrs Heath said her loyal customer had only recently had carpeting on her stairs done by Mick's.</p>

      <p>She said: "I read it in the Burton Mail and felt so terrible for her.</p>
      <p>"I thought of how devastated I'd be if it were to happen to us, we just want to help.</p>
      <p>"As a family business, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">based in Burton</a> since the 1960s and being a small business, we want to help how we can, we feel sympathy for our customers.</p>
      <p>"Following Carol's predicament, we have realised there are also a lot of people in Rolleston affected by the flooding.</p>
      <p>"As a company, we would like, for anyone affected by the flooding, to offer them free rugs to protect the floor and then offer a discount for carpetting, particularly for those that are self-funded."</p>
      <p>The firm will be handing out 5x3ft rugs to those who need them and can prove they have been impacted by flooding in their homes.</p>
