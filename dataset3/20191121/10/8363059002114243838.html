      <h1>OnePlus 3 Series Gets Its Last Software Update</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:30:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>The OnePlus 3 and 3T are crooning their swan song with the final update, with the rollout starting this week.</p>
      <p>OnePlus made the announcement in an update on its <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-9-0-6-for-oneplus-3-oneplus-3t.1142865/">forum</a> that detailed the very brief patch notes for two handsets that includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated Android security patch to 2019.10</li>
        <li>General bug fixes and improvements</li>
        <li>Updated GMS apps</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rollout started yesterday for a "limited number of users" and will get out to everyone else over the course of a few days or weeks. OnePlus has stressed that the rollout isn't region-based on using VPN to download it isn't necessarily going to get it to you any sooner. It's happening seemingly at random.</p>
      <p>"This will be the last update for these two devices and we can't thank you enough for your invaluable feedback throughtout these three years," reads the update. "With your support, we improved Oxygen OS across three major Android versions and dozens of updates.</p>
      <p>"This is not the end for the OnePlus 3 and 3T, though. Starting next week, we will start highlighting some of great work done by the developer community, for those of you considering to have a go at Custom ROMs."</p>
      <p>The OnePlus 3 series launched in 2016 and has enjoyed its <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/">promised software maintenance schedule</a> of 36 months, so now it's time to take it out behind the shed and put it out of its misery.
