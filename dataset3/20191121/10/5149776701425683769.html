      <h1>Reported Nottingham Forest transfer target 'waiting on his options in January'</h1>
      <h2>The Reds have been linked with a January transfer window move for Newcastle United striker Dwight Gayle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:08:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United will “listen to offers” for reported <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> target Dwight Gayle in January.</p>
      <p>The Reds were said to be keen on the striker in the summer, and it has been claimed they <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/dwight-gayle-nottingham-forest-newcastle-3449184">could reignite their interest</a> when the window opens in a few weeks.</p>
      <p>Gayle has featured just twice for the Magpies under Steve Bruce this season, coming off the bench against both Chelsea and Wolves last month.</p>
      <p>And though boss Bruce has previously said the 29-year-old will get his chance, it has been suggested United will be willing to let him leave midway through the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Chronicle Live</a> report: “They’ll be listening to offers for Dwight Gayle - although don’t expect that to be advertised publicly - and if he leaves, a replacement would be possible.”</p>
      <p>West Bromwich Albion, where Gayle spent last term on loan, are also said to be eyeing up the forward, while he has also been <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/reported-nottingham-forest-target-willing-3528752">linked with a big money move</a> to the Chinese Super League.</p>

      <p>The Chronicle also state that Gayle came close to joining the Baggies in the summer but that he wanted to wait to see what else was on the table come January.</p>
      <p>“Newcastle were prepared to sell him to West Brom just before deadline day in August,” the report says.</p>
      <p>“United had lined up a loan deal with an agreement of a permanent £15m switch if the Baggies were promoted.</p>
      <p>“But Gayle was savvy enough to know the pendulum would swing in his favour in the coming months.</p>
      <p>“He preferred a permanent deal to know what the future holds - and a Premier League chance - and informed West Brom he’d be <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/nottingham-forest-transfer-news-gayle-3560211">waiting on his options</a> in January and beyond (while attempting to breakthrough at Newcastle).”</p>
