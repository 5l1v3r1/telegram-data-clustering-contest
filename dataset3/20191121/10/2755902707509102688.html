      <p>Following yesterday’s<b><a href="https://iharare.com/the-moment-when-zrp-indiscriminately-beat-up-civilians-in-harare-cbd/"> brutal and indiscriminate beating of civilians by officers of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP),</a></b></p>
      <p>Zimbabweans based in the diaspora are reaching out to the spouses of the ZRP commissioners begging them to intercede for the sake of the people and their husbands. This comes after yesterday’s brutal and indiscriminate beating of civilians by officers of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) which <b><a href="https://iharare.com/us-govt-condemns-zrps-indiscriminate-beatings/">shocked the world</a></b>.</p>
      <p>Following yesterday’ shocking and depressing events, several social media accounts, which have been described as vigilantes in some quarters, alleged that the ZRP commander who was in charge of the brutality was Assistant Commissioner Charles Ndoro.  Some of these so-called vigilante accounts even shared his phone number and that of his wife.</p>
      <p>Some citizens who are based outside the country took the opportunity to reach out to Ndoro’s wife. In one such message, the person then politely asked Mrs Ndoro to advise her husband not to order the police to brutalize civilians. The person went on to use former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri as an example of how the system eventually spits you out after using you.</p>
      <p>Below are some of the chats from the internet.</p>
