      <p>Tirupati is all set to host the prestigious three-day National Inter District Junior Athletics Meet (NIDJAM) from November 23 to 25. Over 5,000 athletes from all over India are set to participate in the event.</p>
      <p>The Chittoor district administration, which is hosting the event, is leaving no stone unturned to make it a hit. District Collector Bharat Narayana Gupta has conducted a series of review meetings with all the heads of the departments, entrusting them with key works pertaining to the event, focussing on the arrangements of grounds, accommodation, transportation and food. Incidentally, Chittoor district hosted the NIDJAM 2018 also.</p>
      <p>While the Government of Andhra Pradesh released ₹50 lakh for the mega event, the district administration has embarked on collecting donations from sports lovers and corporates. From November 21 onwards, the organisers are ready to host the participants arriving beforehand for practice, which included various athletic games such as running, high and long jumps, javelin and discuss throws.</p>
      <h3>12 venues</h3>
      <p>The District Collector, who is also chairman of the NIDJAM, said 12 venues were getting ready at different university campuses for the events. The Tirupati Municipal Corporation has been entrusted with the food arrangements, while it’s the turn of the Tirupati Urban Development Authority to make arrangements at the grounds hosting the competitions.</p>
      <p>The officials said that so far 2,578 boys and 1,794 girls (under 15 and 14 categories)from 469 districts of various States and Union Territories had registered for the event. About 800 officials drafted from all government departments would be overseeing the arrangements.</p>
      <h3>MLA visits grounds</h3>
      <p>Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy visited the various grounds in and around Tirupati and interacted with the local participants and officials. He said all steps were taken to make the event a success.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a sudden downpour on Wednesday led to some water logging at various venues, including the main ground at SV University stadium. Workers have been deployed in large numbers to remove the stagnant waters and level the grounds.</p>
