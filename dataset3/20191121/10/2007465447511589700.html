      <h1>Will next-gen Tucson look as good as the Hyundai Vision T?</h1>
      <h2>Are we looking at the all-new Hyundai Tucson in concept form?</h2>

      <p>The third-generation Hyundai Tucson has been with us since 2015. While still looking fresh thanks to a recent facelift, it is already getting long in the tooth and is due for a replacement. Luckily, it looks like Hyundai has been busy designing an all-new model, albeit still in concept form.</p>

      <p>After being teased several weeks ago, Hyundai has officially revealed the Vision T at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. Serving as the Hyundai Design Center's seventh concept, it highlights the brand's evolving Sensous Sportiness global design language, and is powered by a plug-in hybrid powertrain.</p>

      <p>Thanks to its unique shape, the Vision T gives off the illusion of motion even while it's standing still. Combined with its long wheelbase, short overhangs, and coupe-like design, Hyundai claims this is their most dynamic-looking SUVs to date. The company even went on to say that this is their vision for a new urban adventure SUV design direction.</p>

      <p>From the front fascia, to the side profile, as well as its rear, the Vision T is dominated by sharp creases, muscular curves, and intersecting lines that further give the concept its sleek appearance. Also worth mentioning is its unique air shuttle grill design. While stationary, the grill is fully closed. Once on the move, the grill design slowly opens up in a prescribed sequence which helps control airflow to the powertrain, and optimize aerodynamics.</p>

      <p>A seamless side window design highlights the concept's coupe-like shape, while the overly-large five-spoke alloy wheels give it a sportier look. Meanwhile, the squared-off wheel arches and additional body cladding provide the Vision T with a more rugged finish.</p>
      <p>Hyundai did not go into detail regarding the Vision T's plug-in hybrid powertrain. Given that this concept is a prelude for an all-new Tucson, perhaps the next-generation crossover will have a plug-in hybrid option available.</p>

      <p>Will we see the production version of the Vision T soon? Fingers crossed Hyundai reveals it some time in 2020 or in 2021.</p>
