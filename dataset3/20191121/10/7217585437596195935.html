      <p>Google on Wednesday revealed new creation tools for Google Earth that allow users to tell stories about all the places they’ve visited.</p>
      <p>“With creation tools in Google Earth, you can draw your own placemarks, lines and shapes, then attach your own custom text, images, and videos to these locations,” the company said on its <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/earth/new-google-earth-creation-tools/">website</a>.</p>
      <p>This means users tools can attach stories about different locations around the world to Google Earth’s map and share these stories with others.</p>
      <p>“By clicking the new “Present” button, your audience will be able to fly from place to place in your custom-made Google Earth narrative,” Google explained.</p>
      <p>Additionally, users can invite others to collaborate on stories as well.</p>
      <p>“Thanks to an integration with Google Drive, you can share your stories with your audience and they can view it anywhere—their phone, tablet or laptop,” the company also noted.</p>
      <p>The creation tools are available on the web version of Google Earth, while Android and iOS users can view ongoing projects on their devices.</p>
