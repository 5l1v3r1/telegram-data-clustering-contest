        <b>KSI’s brother Deji is giving away the boxing gloves he wore in the fight against Jake Paul, after bids on them reached £65,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not too shabby.</p>
      <p>The younger Olatunji brother lost out in the fight against Jake during the undercard of the 2018 match between KSI and Logan Paul.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/08/25/jake-paul-left-with-bloodied-face-as-he-battles-deji-at-ksi-vs-logan-paul-youtube-fight-7882713/">he did manage to give his rival a bloody nose in the process.</a></p>
      <p>First taking to eBay, Deji insisted he would be selling the gloves, with bids reaching more than £65,000, before he claimed that the page had been taken down ‘because of the blood’.</p>

      <p>Not gruesome at all.</p>
      <p>He went on to claim that he’d received private offers of up to £250,000, although he’s since decided to ‘give back’ to fans by giving away the gloves.</p>
      <p>‘You guys know I fought Jake Paul with these gloves and everything, they hold memories,’ he explained in a YouTube video.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘If you decide to sell [them]… make sure you buy your mum a house, something nice. Treat your parents to something.’</p>
      <p>Unable to resist a jab at the Paul brother, he said: ‘Obviously I’m gonna clean [them], because they’ve got Jake Paul’s blood. Someone told me he’s got herpes.’</p>
      <p>Although Deji didn’t attend the KSI and Logan rematch, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksi-triumphs-logan-paul-boxing-rematch-fierce-fight-11068044/">he was one of the first to congratulate his brother on his win.</a></p>

      <p>In a move that surprised fans after their feud, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/ksis-brother-deji-ninja-lead-congratulations-youtuber-wins-logan-paul-epic-rematch-11073057/">he shared a snap of them both on his Instagram after the eagerly-anticipated rematch</a>, saying: ‘JJ, you’ve made me so proud. You are honestly a role model in my life.</p>
      <p>‘We fight, I know but regardless of that; you’re amazing. Well done on your win! I love you bro.’</p>
      <p>However, things haven’t always been as friendly between the pair, with the drama culminating on Christmas Day last year, when JJ was ‘thrown out’ of the family home.</p>
      <p>He later insisted that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/19/youtuber-ksi-says-birthday-taken-brother-deji-makes-life-hell-feud-10013782/">Deji had ‘made his life hell’.</a></p>
      <p>Nevertheless, with the 22-year-old celebrating his brother’s win, it seems the brothers have finally put aside their differences.</p>
