      <p>A severely disabled child with cerebral palsy who was assessed by three doctors at home after contracting salmonella, tragically died after then developing undiagnosed sepsis.</p>
      <p>Eight year old Thomas, who was described as generally being happy and healthy, came down with vomiting and diarrhoea five days before his death on March 26, 2018.</p>
      <p>An inquest at Exeter’s County Hall yesterday heard it was deemed ‘safe’ for him to continued to be cared for by his parents at his home in Devon, which was their preferred choice due to the risk of hospital infections.</p>
      <p>However, had they been advised he required it they said they would have consented for him to be hospitalised.</p>

      <p>Evidence from all the doctors who treated Thomas stated it was not believed his condition had worsened, and no obvious signs of sepsis were apparent.</p>
      <p>In a statement his mum Lisa recalled Thomas was born with a grade five brain damage and they were told he would never be able to do anything for himself, including walking, talking and feeding.</p>
      <p>Thomas and his two brothers moved to Devon in October 2016. As part of his daily care he was fed through a tube five times every 24 hours, which included pureed homemade family meals and milk.</p>
      <p>Lisa described how she was “always meticulous” about preparing his food keeping his equipment regularly.</p>
      <p>She told how the bout of vomiting and diarrhoea he came down with late evening on March 21 was ‘very unusual and a noticeable change’.</p>
      <p>It prompted her and Thomas’s father Oliver to call the doctor who made a home visit the following day. A stool sample was taken and it was confirmed the following day he had salmonella.</p>
      <p>Despite an initial improvement Thomas, who also had epilepsy, deteriorated, and in the early hours of March 24 they rang 111.</p>
      <p>Lisa recalled: “He was very lethargic and sleepy. He had not eaten for quite some time and was looking poorly. He was crying now and again; he never cried.”</p>
      <p>She added: “It was heartbreaking.”</p>
      <p>An oncall Devon Doctors GP who visited their home confirmed he was not dehydrated or in pain. The inquest heard a hospital admission was offered but it was agreed he could stay at home.</p>
      <p>Another doctor, Timothy Watson, was urgently sent to the home the following afternoon after 111 were called again, by which point Lisa said they were ‘beyond worried’.</p>
      <p>She said: “He was very ill and sleepy, and did not open his eyes. The doctor did not seem to appreciate how ill Thomas was.</p>
      <p>“After Dr Watson left I should have felt safe and reassured, but I wasn’t. I was a nervous wreck and believed he should have been admitted.</p>
      <p>“We continued to do our best to keep him comfortable.”</p>
      <p>She continued: “Our preference was to keep Thomas at home, but we didn’t have an issue with him being hospitalised if he needed to be. None of the GPs said he needed to go.”</p>
      <p>At around 11.45pm, Lisa said she felt something was not right and when she checked on Thomas he was unresponsive.</p>
      <p>Despite the CPR she and ambulance staff gave him, he passed away shortly afterwards at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.</p>
      <p>She said: “Our whole life changed after that. Oliver and I devoted our lives to him. All we did was in his best interest. We both gave up well paid jobs to look after him.</p>
      <p>“Thomas meant the world to us. We tried to make sure he achieved all he was capable of.”</p>
      <p>Describing what Thomas was like she said: “He always had smile for us and made everything worthwhile. Every day he is missed.”</p>
      <p>She added: “I miss him so much. He touched so many hearts. He was our little boy, brave boy and our sweetheart. Words cannot express what our family has lost.”</p>

      <p>Dr Timothy Watson told the inquest he arrived at the house at around 2.20pm.</p>
      <p>He said: “Clinically it was a picture of improvement from the previous day.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “I had a discussion with his parents and there were two options – either admission into hospital or continue with rehydration which they seemed to be managing very well.</p>
      <p>“Their starting point was if it was possible the preference was to avoid admission, but there was never any feeling they would not accept it.</p>
      <p>He added: “I felt continued management at home under the circumstances seemed reasonable and safe.”</p>
      <p>The inquest heard no markers of sepsis were identified, worsening advice was given and his parents were happy with the plan.</p>
      <p>Pediatric pathologist Dr Andrew Bamber stated he did not think cerebral palsy directly contributed to Thomas's death or dehydration, the levels of which were abnormal but were not possible to measure.</p>
      <p>He concluded the most significant findings were evidence of a ‘severe’ infection.</p>
      <p>Dr Bamber told the inquest sepsis was not always easy to recognise in a child.</p>
      <p>He said: “Children can seem very well until they are quite deep in trouble and become sick very quickly.</p>
      <p>He added: “Children with cerebral palsy can’t say they feel sick so sometimes it’s harder to spot on children with those disorders.”</p>
      <p>The cause of death given was salmonella and sepsis.</p>
      <p>Concluding the inquest, coroner Philip Spinney told how Thomas died as a consequence of an infection that developed into sepsis.</p>
      <p>He said: “The opinion of the attending doctors made within the context of clinical judgements does not support the conclusion of any neglect in this case.”</p>
      <p>Recording a narrative conclusion, Mr Spinney said: “Thomas died as a consequence of complications following a salmonella infection.”</p>
