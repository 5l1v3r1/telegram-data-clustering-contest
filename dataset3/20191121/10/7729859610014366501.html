      <p>A club statement said: "Our vision is to create a bigger Anfield which would allow more fans to watch some of Europe's best football in a world-class facility in the heart of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"We invite you to a series of drop-ins to find out more about our progress so far. We want to hear from local residents, businesses and fans as we develop and shape our proposals."</p>
      <p>Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, spent £115m on the new Main Stand in 2016 and are continuing their redevelopment of Anfield.</p>
      <p>The club scrapped a proposal to expand Anfield back in August to work on this "larger" planning application.</p>
