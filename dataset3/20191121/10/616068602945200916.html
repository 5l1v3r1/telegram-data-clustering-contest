      <p>A 911 call from a woman who was running for a train has prompted police in Southern Ontario to remind people that the number is meant for emergencies only.</p>
      <p>In audio posted on Twitter by Peel Regional Police on Thursday, the caller says she's in a taxi on her way to catch a train at Toronto's Union Station.</p>
      <p>When the 911 operator asks the caller what she wants police to do, the woman asks if they offer "emergency ride services."</p>
      <p>The call, which took place in October, ends when the operator tells the woman that no such service exists.</p>
      <p>Const. Akhil Mooken says Peel Regional Police received more than 180,000 improper calls from the start of January to the end of October this year.</p>
      <p>He says they included hangups, kids playing on the phone or other non-emergencies.</p>
