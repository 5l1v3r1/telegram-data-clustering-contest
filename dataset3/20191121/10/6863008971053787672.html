      <p>The Pentagon plans to pay Ukraine all military aid by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>"Congress did not direct accelerated obligation of the funds. The Department is nonetheless expediting the process of implementing the authorized assistance to Ukraine and is committed to obligating these funds as quickly as possible in accordance with contracting procedures as required by law," Lt. Col. Thomas Campbell, a defense department spokesperson, told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-20-19/index.html">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, over $35 million of the roughly $400 million in aid to Ukraine that U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly delayed, sparking the impeachment inquiry, has not been released to the country.</p>
