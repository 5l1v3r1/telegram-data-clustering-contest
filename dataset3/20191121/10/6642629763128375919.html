      <p>At least 22 civilians have been killed in Syria's northwest region as Russian-backed government forces continued air raids and shelling in the last rebel-held territory in the war-torn country, according to volunteer medics.</p>
      <p>At least 16 people were killed and scores wounded when a ground-to-ground missile struck a camp for displaced people in the village of Qah on Wednesday, said Ahmed Yarji, a spokesman for Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets.</p>
      <p>Among those who lost their lives were 10 children and three women, Yarji told Al Jazeera.</p>

      <p>The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) <a href="https://t.co/y0mOztXcQK?amp=1">said</a> in a statement that the two missiles exploded 25 metres away from its maternity hospital, injuring four of its staff members.</p>
      <p>The hospital "sustained considerable material damage, causing the medical staff to evacuate patients to nearby facilities", the statement added.</p>
      <p>Idlib province is facing a serious lack of adequate medical facilities.</p>
      <p>The attack on the Qah maternity hospital marks the 65th attack on 47 health facilities in northwest Syria since the end of April 2019.</p>

      <p>Russia has long been accused of carrying out attacks against hospitals and medical facilities throughout its involvement in Syria’s war. </p>
      <p>Last month, the New York Times published a report looking into Russian air raids on Idlib over a 12-hour period, which found that the Russian air force repeatedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/world/middleeast/russia-bombing-syrian-hospitals.html">bombed</a> hospitals in an effort to crush the last opposition-held stronghold.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, UN officials <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/aid-chief-syria-russia-attacks-civilians-deliberate-190619072034833.html">alleged Russian forces may be deliberately targeting</a> hospitals and schools as a tactic to "terrorise" civilians - accusations denied by both Syria and Russia. </p>
      <p>The UN early in August established a board of inquiry to investigate the bombing of United Nations-supported medical facilities in the northwest of the country.</p>
      <h3>Fragile truce</h3>
      <p>The attack came just hours after the town of Maaret al-Numan, also in northwestern Syria, was hit by an air raid, which killed at least six people, including four children, and wounded others, according to Ahmed Sheikho, a White Helmets volunteer in the area.</p>
      <p>The rebel-held province has endured a Russian-backed bombing campaign that aims to recapture the last remaining opposition stronghold in Syria.</p>
      <p>Russia, which supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and Turkey, a longtime a backer of opposition factions, had cosponsored a de-escalation agreement for the area earlier this year that has since faltered.</p>

      <p>The four-month-long offensive launched earlier this year has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/1000-civilians-killed-syria-4-months-190904094645974.html">killed more than 1,000 civilians</a>, according to the UN.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been displaced by violence in the Idlib region since the end of April.</p>
      <p>Half the population in northwest Syria has been uprooted at least once with some being displaced up to seven times over the eight-year-long conflict, according to Save the Children.</p>
      <p>In August, after being surrounded by government troops, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/syria-war-armed-rebels-withdraw-idlib-khan-shaikhoun-190820063255105.html">opposition fighters withdrew from Khan Sheikhoun</a>, a key town that had been in rebel hands since 2014.</p>
      <p>Khan Sheikhoun lies on the strategic M5 highway that connects Damascus with the northern city of Aleppo. The Syrian government has been fighting to regain the highway, a move that would allow it to connect cities under its control and boost trade.</p>
      <p>Many of those who resided in and around Khan Sheikhoun have taken shelter near the Turkey-Syria border, fleeing bombardment.</p>
      <p>A ceasefire announced by Moscow on August 31 has reduced air raids, but skirmishes on the ground persist.</p>
      <p>The region is home to nearly three million people, half of whom were transferred there en masse from other areas that were taken by pro-government forces.</p>
      <p>The war in Syria has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions since erupting in 2011 with the repression of anti-government protests.</p>
