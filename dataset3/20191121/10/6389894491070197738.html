      <p>In a gloomy update to its forecasts, the Paris-based organisation said countries were also failing on tackling climate change, the digitisation of economies and a breakdown of the rules-based global order.</p>
      <p>The world economy is set to grow 2.9 per cent this year and in 2020, the OECD said, the weakest expansions for 10 years. In 2021, growth is predicted to rise to just three per cent.</p>
