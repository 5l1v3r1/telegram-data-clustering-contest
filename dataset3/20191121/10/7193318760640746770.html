      <p>Oklahoma manufacturers are driving Oklahoma’s economy toward top 10 status, Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell told an audience of manufacturers and their support network Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Speaking before about 300 people at an Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance’s “Together We Make It” dinner at the Embassy Suites Downtown/Medical Center, Pinnell lauded manufacturers as “entrepreneurs” creating jobs at higher wages than other state industries.</p>
      <p>“Those who are in this room and have started businesses, you are entrepreneurs,” Pinnell said. “We’re talking about over 4,000 manufacturing firms in the state of Oklahoma, over 140,000 employees of those firms and, this is key, 20 percent higher wages in your sector than in other sectors.”</p>
      <p>In addition to manufacturers and OMA’s manufacturing extension agents who provide expertise, Pinnell’s audience included economic development leaders, educators and state legislators.</p>
      <p>Pinnell praised the Manufacturing Alliance and its partners in what is known as the Oklahoma Innovation Model that supports manufacturers and small businesses across the state. The Manufacturing Alliance, i2E Inc., the Oklahoma Center for the Advancement of Science and Technology (OCAST) and the New Product Development Center at Oklahoma State University comprise that support network.</p>
      <p>“We can’t get there without you,” Pinnell said. “It’s critical that we work in a hand-in-glove relationship. The Innovation Pipeline Model with i2E and OCAST and the Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance are helping companies thrive. It’s important that it’s not just two counties in the state of Oklahoma, but it’s 77 counties in the state of Oklahoma.”</p>
      <p>Dave Rowland, CEO of the Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance, described the event as a celebration of manufacturing and the support network that includes both state and federal resources.</p>
      <p>“It’s a vast network: the educational system, the economic development system, our partners at the federal level with innovation and technology,” Rowland said. “We’re in a very unique place and want to make sure that everybody recognizes that we have this vast resource that we can bring from all over the United States to help a single manufacturer in Oklahoma become something greater than they are today.”</p>
      <p>Also addressing the audience was Phillip Singerman, associate director for Innovation and Industry Services with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Singerman’s agency manages a 30-year-old initiative called the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program that provides expertise for manufacturers through organizations like the Oklahoma Manufacturing Alliance.</p>
      <p>“OMA is one of the leaders nationally,” Singerman said. “It’s in the top 10%, one of the top five performing centers in the nation. We are very pleased to be able to support and partner with the state. We at the federal government are delighted to be a partner with you and we look forward to working with you for many more years.”</p>
      <p>Michael Carolina, executive director of OCAST, a state agency charged with working to diversify and grow the state’s economy, described the Oklahoma Innovation Model as a successful initiative that other states envy and seek to emulate.</p>
      <p>“I think we’ve found the right formula between government, industry and academia to form this relationship and partnership so that we leverage that to say to the world that ‘we are open for business in Oklahoma,’ ” Carolina said. “We have that kind of collaboration going on, and we’ve been successful at it.”</p>
      <p>Other speakers at the OMA event included Brent Kisling, executive director of the state Commerce Department, and Sean Kouplen, secretary of commerce and workforce development.</p>
      <p>At the conclusion of the dinner, Rowland said the event was created to deliver a message to manufacturers that they are valued for their contributions to Oklahoma’s economy.</p>
      <p>“We want the manufacturers to feel good about the resources and capabilities that the country has to support them,” Rowland said. “The manufacturers are really the ones we wanted to thank and make sure that they felt appreciated by the people here.”</p>
