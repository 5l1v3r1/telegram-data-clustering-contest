      <p>Yup, the fast food chain’s been getting festive, with their own seasonal offerings arriving in branches across the UK yesterday.</p>
      <p>They’ve got everything on offer from special burgers to desserts and even a coffee or two – but just what is on their festive menu?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>What is on the McDonald’s Christmas menu?</h3>
      <p>The McDonald’s Christmas menu sees the return of some old favourites as well as a few new items for the festive season.</p>

        <figcaption>Look out for the Chicken Deluxe which is new to the menu (Picture: McDonald’s)</figcaption>

      <p>For starters, the <b>Big Tasty</b> is back for Christmas, bringing customers a beef burger topped with Emmental cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the special Big Tasty sauce.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>On its own it’s £4.29 or you can get it as a medium meal for £5.89 – and if you’d like bacon on top, that’ll cost you an extra 40p.</p>
      <p>Also look out for their brand new <b>Chicken Deluxe burger,</b> which includes crispy chicken, tomato relish, mayo, cheese, lettuce and red onion rings.</p>
      <p>if you want to feel really festive, meanwhile, they’ve added <b>Camembert Cheese Dippers</b> to the menu.</p>

      <p>Five of those will set you back £1.69, or a sharing box costs £4.40</p>
      <p>If after all that you still have room for dessert, the good news is that the mint <b>Matchmaker McFlurry</b> is returning to the menu for the first time since Christmas 2013.</p>
      <p>The festive treat will come in two sizes, the regular for £1.39 and a mini version for 99p.</p>
      <p>Oh, and don’t forget about Santa’s reindeer either – as McDonald’s carrot bags have been renamed <b>Reindeer Treats</b> for the season.</p>
      <h3>Is McDonald’s doing festive coffee?</h3>
      <p>There are indeed festive drinks to be found on the McCafe menu, as you can also nab yourself a <b>Millionaire’s Latte</b> – making a festive return to the menu – complete with caramel syrup and chocolate cream, a <b>Toffee Latte</b> or <b>Hot Chocolate</b>.</p>
      <p>Also back for Christmas is the <b>Chocolate Brownie</b>, along with new additions including a <b>Mixed Berry Muffin</b> and <b>Millionaire’s Doughnut</b>, topped with biscuit pieces and a dark chocolate drizzle.</p>
