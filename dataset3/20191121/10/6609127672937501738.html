      <p>The deals are available in Mothercare stores and online as long as stocks last, as part of its closing down sale.</p>
      <p>With Christmas just over a month away, it could be the perfect time to stock up on essentials.</p>
      <p>It's best to be quick though as Mothercare is set to close all 79 stores within a few months, after it collapsed into administration in the beginning of November.</p>
      <p>It announced a closing down sale a few weeks ago, but has now also rolled out its early Black Friday deals.</p>

      <p>When shopping on Black Friday, always compare the prices beforehand as you may be able to find better deals elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Google's price comparison tool, <a href="https://www.google.com/shopping?hl=en">Google Shopping</a>, is free and easy to use.</p>
      <p>Luckily, Mothercare is currently offering the cheapest prices on the products we've listed above.</p>
      <p>Although, if you're not fussed about the colour of the Tommee Tipeee starter set then you can get away cheaper by snapping up a grey set for just £14 at <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/tommee-tippee-closer-to-nature-newborn-starter-kit/p3344091">John Lewis</a>.</p>
      <h3>Our tips for finding the best deals this Black Friday</h3>
      <p>
        <b>IT might be tempting to dive in and snap up LOADS of items on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but here’s how you can guarantee you’re getting a good deal.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>PREPARE</b> Research the items you want to buy and find out the cheapest price. Websites like PriceSpy, PriceHistory and CamelCamelCamel will give you historical data on prices so you can see how much you should pay.</p>
      <p><b>GET FOLLOWING </b>Follow your favourite shops on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and sign up to its deals newsletter to get the latest on any offers. We post the best deals in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSunMoney/">Sun Money FB group</a> too.</p>
      <p><b>EARN CASHBACK</b> Check websites like Quidco and TopCashback BEFORE you place your order. Cashback websites PAY you to shop. All you have to do is click through their links and the money is added to your online account, usually within 14 days.</p>
      <p>Mothercare is just one of many retailers launching deals for Black Friday.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for other offers, check out our Black Friday page, where you'll be able to find the key areas likely to feature in the event.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can also get in early as some high street shops have already launched their sales, with up to 60 per cent off goods.</p>
