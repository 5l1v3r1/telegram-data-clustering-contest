      <h1>Finland Has an App Showing Shopping's True Carbon Footprint</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Bloomberg: <i>Unlike other carbon-footprint <a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">calculators</a> already on the market, the application developed by Enfuce Financial Services Oy, a Finnish payment services provider, does not rely on users inputting the data manually. Instead, it combines data from credit cards and banks with purchase data from retailers <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/finland-has-an-app-that-reveals-shopping-s-true-carbon-footprint">to provide real-time calculations of how a given product affects the climate</a>. With an estimated 70% of carbon emissions globally attributed to end users, Enfuce chairman and co-founder Monika Liikamaa says the app will help people adapt their lifestyles and make them compatible with the goal of keeping global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius. <br/><br/>After the initial set up and opt-in, the app will calculate a carbon footprint based on the user's purchases -- to the level of individual steaks or tomatoes. It will then propose actions to reduce their carbon impact. Typical suggestions may include taking a shorter shower, hopping on the bus instead of the car, turning down the thermostat and going vegan for a week. The app is a side project for Enfuce, which already handles sensitive payments data securely. Its core business is to run credit card systems for clients that do not require owning expensive computer servers. Enfuce is in talks with three major banks and is already working with Mastercard Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud-server unit. No vendor will have exclusive rights to the system, which should be available by March, the company said.</i></p>
