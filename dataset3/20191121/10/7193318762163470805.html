        <b>What new benefit options are available to businesses starting next year?</b>
      </p>
      <p>New rules issued by the Departments of the Treasury, Labor and Health and Human Services in June created two new Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs) that may be used to reimburse medical expenses and individual health insurance premiums for businesses of all sizes. Beginning Jan. 1, employers may start using Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRA), Excepted Benefits Health Reimbursement Arrangements (EBHRA) and Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRA).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Which employers may offer the new ICHRAs and EBHRAs?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Businesses, nonprofits, churches, local governments that have at least one W-2 employee and meet specific other requirements. Employers who have been unable to afford to offer benefits before may strategically develop benefit plans to help all classes of employees. These new options will provide all employers with many choices in designing employee benefits plans to help attract and retain employees in this competitive labor market.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What expenses may an employer reimburse an employee for with the new ICHRAs?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Employers may pay for premiums paid toward individual health insurance, whether it was bought on or off the marketplace (healthcare.gov), including Medicare parts A &amp; B and C, as well as part D, and Medigap premiums. The plan also may reimburse employees for any medical expenses listed in IRS code section 213 (d). Examples include dental treatment, physical exams, X-rays, hospital services and more. The employer also may limit which Section 213 (d) expenses the plan will reimburse.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there a limit or minimum amount that an employee may provide when offering an ICHRA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No. The employer may decide on how much they want the ICHRA to reimburse. There are no minimum or maximum amounts. The amount elected by the employer may not vary within a “class” or group of employees other than by age up to a 3-to-1 difference and by the number of dependents in the family coverage.</p>
      <p>
        <b>May an employer offer both a traditional group health plan and an ICHRA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>No, not to the same class of employees. The employer, though, may create up to 11 different classes of employees and offer one class an ICHRA and a different class a traditional group health plan. When creating different classes of employees, employers must follow strict guidelines based on the size of the company and the definition of each class. As an example, businesses with fewer than 100 employees must have at least 10 employees in the classes they use. One class may be defined as full-time employees, and another class may be defined as part-time employees. You are not allowed to offer the employees of one class a choice between a group health plan and an ICHRA.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What other rules must an employer follow when offering an ICHRA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Participants must confirm enrollment in individual health coverage each time a request is made for a reimbursement. Participants must be able to opt-out and waive any future reimbursements. Participants must be provided notice 90 days before the beginning of each plan year. Other regulatory reporting requirements are required.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What benefits may an employer reimburse an employee for with the new the Excepted Benefits Health Reimbursement Arrangements (EBHRAs)?</b>
      </p>
      <p>These plans may reimburse all IRS Code Section 213(d) expenses, dental vision, and short-term limited duration insurance premiums, but no individual, group health insurance, or Medicare premiums. COBRA premiums are allowed.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Is there a limit or minimum amount that an employee may provide when offering an EBHRA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. The maximum benefit can't exceed $1,800 per employee for the plan year (indexed for inflation beginning 2021.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>May an employer offer both a traditional group health plan and an EBHRA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. The employer must offer a group health plan, and the employee must be eligible to enroll in the plan to receive this benefit. Please note enrollment in the plan is not required in order to participate in the EBHRA the employee simply needs to be eligible to enroll.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What other rules must an employer follow when offering an EBHRA?</b>
      </p>
      <p>These plans require expense substantiation similar to a Flexible Spending Account (FSA). Plan documents, example Summary Plan Descriptions (SPD’s) must be provided. Carryover options are allowed. No employee contributions are allowed.</p>
