      <p>Rafael van der Vaart has posted on Twitter after Tottenham Hotspur appointed the Dutchman’s former manager Jose Mourinho as Mauricio Pochettino’s replacement, agreeing a deal until the summer of 2023.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was relieved of his duties on Tuesday night after a disappointing start to the 2019-20 campaign. Spurs are already out of the Carabao Cup and have picked up just three keague wins from 12 league games this season.</p>
      <p>Just hours later, Spurs confirmed the appointment of former Manchester United and Chelsea boss Mourinho. The Portuguese gaffer took charge of his first training session later that day – and has his first press conference on Thursday at 2pm.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs midfielder van der Vaart worked under Mourinho during the Dutchman’s time at Real Madrid, and while he is saddened at the departure of Pochettino – he has backed the appointment of Mourinho.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Can Mourinho get off to a winning start?</h3>
      <p>Spurs make the short distance across London to take on local rivals West Ham United at the London Stadium, who are equally in a poor position and lacking in form. Manuel Pellegrini is under pressure as Hammers boss.</p>
      <p>With Spurs seemingly re-energised following the appointment of Mourinho and a new sense of optimism has flown through the side, Mourinho is expected to pick up all three points in his first game. Anything less, and it will be a disappointment.</p>
