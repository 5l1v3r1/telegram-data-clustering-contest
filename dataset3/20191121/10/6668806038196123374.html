      <p>Shahid Kapoor is currently in the top phase of his career. The actor gave a noteworthy performance in his last release Kabir Singh which went on to earn big bucks at the box-office shattering several records at the cash-counters. The suave actor is now gearing up for his next release Jersey for which he has already started his prep. Shahid will be essaying the part of a cricketer in the film and for that the actor is going through severe training to ace the game. But last night, he was snapped at his favourite director Vishal Bharadwaj’s office in Mumbai which has sparked off rumours of a fresh project being on the cards. Shahid and Vishal have worked together on films like Kaminey and Haider, and in both these film Shahid’s performance received a lot of love and appreciation. </p>
      <p>Shahid was clicked with director Vishal Bharadwaj at the latter’s office and the duo even happily posed for pictures on spotting the paparazzi waiting for them. Scroll through to take a look at the snaps from the spot. Well, we hope this duo comes up with yet another entertainer soon. </p>
