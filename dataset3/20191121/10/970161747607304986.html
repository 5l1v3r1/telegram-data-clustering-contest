      <p>Kindhearted people have raised over £15,000 after a girl wrote to Santa asking ‘Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?’</p>
      <p>The child, seven, posted the letter in a special post box to Father Christmas at her community centre.</p>
      <p>It said: ‘Mum wants us all to be together. Can you give us some food and can I have a nice doll for Christmas? Thank you.’</p>
      <p>The heartbreaking note was left at the L6 Community centre in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/everton-fc/">Everton</a>, Liverpool.</p>
      <p>It went viral after Labour councillor Gerard Woodhouse shared it on Twitter, saying: ‘Last week <a href="https://twitter.com/L6Centre">@L6Centre</a> we started getting down Xmas decorations.</p>
      <p>‘We placed The Santa post box in the cafe until [the] grotto is set up.</p>

      <p>‘Today I went into to <a href="https://twitter.com/L6Centre">@L6Centre</a> to sort food parcels for residents. While passing [the] post box I looked in it !! Just read a seven-year-old’s letter. Vote Labour.’</p>
      <p>TOWIE star Gemma Collins then shared the letter, saying: ‘This is the REALITY of what’s actually going on out there!</p>
      <p>‘This was a letter from a child in Liverpool who asked Santa for food this Christmas.</p>
      <p>‘As you know I am very fond of Liverpool and the people there PLEASE let’s help everyone I’m asking can we help this family and family’s like this.’</p>

      <p>A fundraiser for the community centre has now reached £15,445 from over 300 donors.</p>
      <p>The appeal says: ‘The children we work with come to the L6 Centre very distressed and hungry.</p>
      <p>‘We run a youth club for these disadvantaged children of our community and provide them with a hot meal three times a week. We work closely with the local schools and the teachers who refer vulnerable children and families. We also ensure we support families who are deprived at Christmas and Easter</p>
      <p>‘We need funds to keep our 15 freezers kept on after Liverpool Council stopped our funding. And we want to support 5000 families this Christmas.’</p>

      <p>Mr Woodhouse told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-merseyside-50481997">BBC</a> that the girl’s mum lives in a hostel, and that part of the money raised would pay for the family to stay in a hotel for three days over Christmas.</p>

      <p>He said:’She was really shocked her letter went national… but is really excited her family will be staying in a hotel over Christmas.’</p>
      <p>He added she was excited to hear she would get the doll she asked for, saying: ‘She said “wait until I show my friends at school”.</p>
      <p>‘She is a bright girl and knows money is tight.’</p>
