      <p>Terrifying first-person adventure <i>Alien: Isolation</i> will be blasting out of the airlock and onto the Switch in just a couple of weeks' time. Developed by Creative Assemblies, the award-winning 2014 release will be hitting the Nintendo platform on December 5.<br/><br/>For those yet to experience its tense stealth action, <i>Alien: Isolation</i> sees players taking on the role of Amanda Ripley, daughter of franchise protagonist Ellen Ripley, as she investigates the disappearance of her mother in the wake of the original <i>Alien</i> movie. As Amanda picks her way through the Sevastopol space station, she is mercilessly stalked by a roaming Xenomorph, and must use guile and cunning to evade its deadly clutches.</p>

      <p>If that wasn't enough, then Weyland-Yutani corp. is up to its usual shenanigans, throwing numerous hurdles in Ripley's path - mostly in the form of deadly androids and gun-toting security guards. Despite this sporadic gunplay, <i>Alien: Isolation</i> is primarily a stealth-horror title, and one of the better examples the genre has to offer.<br/><br/>The Nintendo Switch release will include gyroscopic aiming, HD rumble support, and all previously released DLC, including the <i>Crew Expendable</i> chapter, featuring characters from the original 1979 movie, such as Ellen Ripley, Dallas, and Parker.<br/><br/><i>Alien: Isolation</i> launches for Nintendo Switch on December 5. It is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One.</p>
