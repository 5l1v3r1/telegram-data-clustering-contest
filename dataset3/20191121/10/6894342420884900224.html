      <h1>Ookyo Is No More: Customers To Be Absorbed By Hotlink On 21 Jan 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:00:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/chapree/" target="_blank">Chief Chapree</a></address>
      <p>Originally <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2017/142674/what-is-ookyo-maxis-prepaid/">launched in 2017</a>, it looks <b>Ookyo</b>’s time in the market is coming to an end. According to the SMS that <b>Maxis</b> has sent to Ookyo’s customers, the telco will be migrating Ookyo customers to <b>Hotlink RED</b> in January 2020.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://ookyo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036448211">the Ookyo’s website</a>, customers don’t have to do anything as the transition to Hotlink RED will take place automatically on 21 January 2020. In fact, they don’t even have to change their SIM card which not exactly surprising since both Ookyo and Hotlink are under Maxis’ umbrella.</p>

      <p>In addition to that, customers will also be provided with free 8GB of data quota as a welcome gift. Valid for 30 days, customers will also receive Non-Stop RED Social pass that provides them unlimited access to Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, and Pinterest for the same duration.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, they will also only need to pay RM 30 per month for the next 12 months from 21 February 2020 onwards, instead of the usual monthly cost of RM 45. Not to forget, any remaining balance within their Ookyo wallet will be automatically transferred to Hotlink RED wallet with the exception of the Google Play wallet which customers need to fully utilize by 20 January 2020.</p>
