      <h1>VW ID. Space Vizzion EV is a lifestyle wagon concept</h1>
      <h2>VW reimagines the wagon into a fast and practical electric vehicle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T10:06:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 10:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>Remember when Volkswagen released <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/volkswagen-id-space-vizzion-concept-is-one-sleek-electric-wagon.html">design renderings</a> of what appeared to be a new wagon concept? Well, just weeks after releasing them, the automaker has officially revealed it in the metal.</p>

      <p>Called the I.D. Space Vizzion, it is Volkswagen's take on making a purely electric wagon that looks good inside and out, as well as have the performance and practicality to boot. Underpinned by the same Modular Electric Drive Matrix platform (MEB) found on the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/is-the-2020-volkswagen-id-3-the-new-people-s-electric-car.html">ID. 3</a>, the new concept takes advantage of an aerodynamic design, along with the freedom of not having an engine upfront.</p>

      <p>Case in point, Volkswagen has a unique front fascia design. While it looks similar to the ID.3, it has a sleeker set of headlights, along with a special front bumper with honeycomb-style ducts that direct air towards the rear. Also worth mentioning is the hood with its high-gloss black paint finish which appears to blend with the tinted windshield and panoramic sunroof.</p>
      <p>Keen-eyed viewers might have also noticed the lack of door handles. That's because VW wanted to keep the car as aerodynamic as possible. It has touch-sensitive surfaces that light up as soon as the car's keyless function detects its users. Massive 22-inch alloy wheels, meanwhile, have a turbine-inspired design that avoids any interruption of airflow. Finally, a huge single taillight design gives the ID. Space Vizzion a sexy-looking rear.</p>

      <p>Step inside and a predominantly white and beige interior invites occupants to the ID. Space Vizzion. Making its home on the center dash is a huge 15.6-inch touchscreen infotainment system. It supports a wide array of online connectivity functions, as well as manage the car's onboard systems.</p>

      <p>Between the seats is a large fold-out center console that has cubby holes, storage bins, cupholders, and USB-C ports. Instead of a traditional instrument panel for the driver, an augmented reality (AR) HUD provides the necessary vehicle information.</p>

      <p>In order to reflect on its zero-emissions powertrain, this concept makes use of reusable and environmentally-friendly materials. What looks to be leather, is actually residual matter from apple juice production called 'AppleSkin'. This makes it possible to replace polyurethane with apple leftovers to make the cabin materials. In the future, VW plans to give AppleSkin a metallic-like finish along with ambient lighting in order for a more futuristic look.</p>
      <p>Powering the I.D. Space Vizzion is a rear-mounted electric motor that puts out 275 PS and 550 Nm of torque. Paired with an 82 kWh battery pack, this all-electric wagon has a maximum range of up to 590 km based on WLTP standards. Alternatively, the EV can also be equipped with an additional front-mounted electric motor which produces 101 PS with 150 Nm. The result is a total system output of 335 PS, a 0 â€“ 100 km/h sprint of 5 seconds flat, a 175 km/h top speed, plus all-wheel-drive capability.</p>

      <p>Under the cargo compartment is a pair of electric skateboards and helmets too, which are supposed to handle the 'last mile' travel to your destination, or if you just feel that you want to have fun.</p>
      <p>We're hoping that Volkswagen can make this electric wagon concept a reality sooner than later, even though it has a very slim chance of being brought here.</p>
