      <h1>The Fall of The Alliance of Evil Against Saudi Arabia</h1>

      <p>No one was surprised with the publishing of intelligence documents that revealed Iranian interference in Iraq. In fact, those documents have confirmed what was already known. No one was shocked by the continued exceptional relations between the Muslim Brotherhood and the Iranian regime. The history of the brotherhood shows its intimate relation with Tehran since Ayatollah Khomeini came to power in 1979.<br/><br/>As for the documents published by The Intercept and The New York Times about a brotherhood-Iranian conspiracy hosted by Turkey against Saudi Arabia, they constitute, in my opinion, one of the most important revelations in 2019; not only because the three sides are seeking enmity with Saudi Arabia, according to evidence and proof, but because the size of collective targeting against the Kingdom is organized and planned for many years. The three sides have held secret summits and intelligence conspiracies, in which they agreed that Saudi Arabia was their “common enemy”, as the documents showed.<br/><br/>What is remarkable at the tripartite summit of evil is not the Iranian-Brotherhood’s hostility against the Kingdom and targeting its security and stability. This is a proven history and these documents will only add other facts. What is striking is Turkey’s hosting of this coalition of evil, by planning to strike the Saudi national security, supporting the Houthis in Yemen and backing the Iranian project there.<br/><br/>The Turkish hypocrisy has reached unprecedented levels; the conspiracy came at a time when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, shortly after the launch of the Decisive Storm operations, announced his country’s support to curbing the expansion of the Houthis, while he was planning otherwise.<br/>Ankara continued with its deception policy. Its president said that his country considered the strategy of King Salman a “safety valve for the region”, but in fact, he was adopting a “dissimilation” policy that was also seen in Iran and with the Muslim Brotherhood.<br/><br/>The best thing about the disclosure of the documents of the tripartite conspiracy is that it proved that the Kingdom’s stance against revolutionary Iran, or its designation of the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist group, was completely correct. On the other hand, the worst thing about it is that Turkey was lying and conspiring against the Kingdom. This was evident in several positions taken by Ankara, including targeting the Kingdom openly, systematically and aggressively since the killing of Jamal Khashoggi and Turkey’s invasion of Syrian territory in flagrant violation of international conventions. These two positions are enough to show the reality of Turkish politics in the region.<br/><br/>Then came the great disaster of conspiring with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood against the Kingdom, within episodes of very poor production, ugly output, but of great usefulness.<br/>The facts on the ground alone can reveal the outcome of the Iranian-Turkish- Brotherhood conspiracy against Saudi Arabia. The Brotherhood remained in their underground positions, and Iran is facing popular anger in Iraq and Lebanon, which is now spreading to its own territory in the worst violent protests since the Green Revolution.<br/>As for Turkey, it has been abandoned by everyone, and it is suffering economically, politically and militarily; it has become a state competing with itself in provoking the world and being the most detested.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the state they have conspired against and held black summits to target was not affected by their actions at all. No wonder that the alliance of evil fell without the Kingdom even bothering to respond to it.</p>
