        <i>• Players will not play first minute of matches in top two divisions <br/>• Protest in response to alleged abuse of Ahmad Mendes Moreira</i>
      </p>
      <p>Players in the top two divisions of Dutch football will stand still for the first minute of matches this weekend as a protest against racism.</p>
      <p>An anti-racism message – “Racism? Then we don’t play football’ – will be displayed on scoreboards during the opening minute at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> and Eerste Divisie games and an extra minute will be added to first-half injury time.</p>
      <p>The move comes after the Excelsior forward Ahmad Mendes Moreira was racially abused by a section of Den Bosch supporters last weekend. The game was suspended for half an hour after the referee decided to take the players off the pitch.</p>
      <p>The Dutch football association said it will investigate and look into possible sanctions against Den Bosch and their supporters after several of the Netherlands side admitted they had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2019/nov/19/wijnaldum-on-racism-in-football-what-can-you-do-as-a-player-its-a-problem-in-society-video">shocked by the incident</a>.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s Georginio Wijnaldum and Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong pointed to the colour of their skin after Wijnaldum scored the first of his three goals in the Netherlands’ 5-0 Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Estonia on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>A series of racist incidents has tainted European football recently. The Brescia striker Mario Balotelli <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/balotelli-returned-to-italy-with-hope-it-has-been-crushed-again-by-racism">threatened to walk off </a>the pitch after receiving alleged racist abuse, while the Shakhtar Donetsk forward Taison was shown a red card for reacting to racist jeers from the crowd during a match.</p>
