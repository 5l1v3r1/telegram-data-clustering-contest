      <h3>THE proposed Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) is gaining support from members of the House of Representatives.</h3>
      <p>In a joint hearing of the Committee on Government Reorganization chaired by Batangas Rep. Mario Vittorio Mariño and the Committee on Disaster Management chaired by Leyte Rep. Lucy Torres-Gomez, members agreed to approve the substitute bill.</p>
      <p>A technical working group (TWG) co-chaired by Rep. Yedda Marie Romualdez (Party-list, TINGOG SINIRANGAN) and Rep. Romeo Momo, Sr. (Party-list, CWS) consolidated and harmonized the provisions of 32 measures led by House Bill No. (HB) 4 authored by Speaker Alan Peter “Compañero” Cayetano.</p>
      <p>Romualdez gave the assurance that during the TWG meeting the structure and budget reorganization of key government agencies were exhaustively discussed. She added that manifestations and proposals of valued stakeholders were earnestly considered as the panel drafted the substitute bill.</p>
      <p>Deputy Speaker Loren Legarda lauded the TWG for thoroughly reviewing the various versions of the measure establishing the DDR, which resulted in a substitute bill that promotes science-based and risk-informed development plans and investments.</p>
      <p>Torres-Gomez expressed delight that the measure is finally a step closer to becoming a law.</p>
      <p>“There will still be many ways to fine-tune the bill so we will wait for the amended substitute bill and then this will be deliberated further on the floor. But I think as representatives we are all one in wanting a department that can really function the way it should,” she said.</p>
      <p>As a priority measure of the Duterte administration, Torres-Gomez expressed confidence the bill will be approved on third reading by the end of 2019.</p>
      <p>“I’m very hopeful. Ganoon naman kapag gusto ng President. And the Speaker, I’m sure, will push for this also,” she said.</p>
      <p>Upon the committees’ approval, Mariño directed that the measure be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means chaired by Rep. Joey Sarte Salceda and the Committee on Appropriations chaired by Rep. Isidro Ungab.</p>
      <p>Salceda bared that his committee is set to tackle and approve the tax provisions of the measure next week.</p>
      <p>In the explanatory note of his HB 4, Speaker Cayetano said that while the country has very good people in the National Disaster Risk, Reduction Management Council, it is high time that the government provided for a focused, single-minded, specialized  department to upgrade the government’s capacity to respond to disasters in an effective and speedy manner.</p>
      <p>The unnumbered substitute bill provides for the creation of a Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) which shall serve as the primary government agency responsible for leading, organizing and managing the national effort to reduce disaster risk, prepare for and respond to disasters, recover and rehabilitate, and build forward better after the occurrence of disasters.</p>
