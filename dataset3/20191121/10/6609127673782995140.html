        <b>SCOTLAND are just two games away from securing a spot at the Euro 2020 finals - but they could find themselves in a 'group of death'.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Steve Clarke's men <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4694106/scotland-euro-2020-play-off-draw-time-tickets/">face a play-off semi-final and final</a> to make it to the tournament proper.</p>

      <p>But they will find out their potential group stage opponents next week - and one scenario doesn't make for good reading.</p>
      <p>The Dark Blues <a href="https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/0257-0e05cf76aaec-6602964740ad-1000--euro-2020-draw-pots-confirmed/?iv=true">could come up against England, France AND Portugal</a> in the early stages of the major finals.</p>
      <p>Scotland are guaranteed to be paired with England in Group D - who are top seeds - due to Hampden and Wembley being host pairings.</p>
      <p>A slightly less daunting route for the Scots would be facing England, Poland and Czech Republic.</p>

      <p>The 24 teams that qualify for Euro 2020 are seeded based on their performances during the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>The ten group winners take the first ten positions, followed by the ten runners up, all ranked by points, goal difference and goals scored to determine their final pot.</p>
      <p>The draw for the Euro 2020 finals takes place on Saturday November 30 and Scotland will be part of the draw.</p>

      <p><b>POT 1 - </b>Belgium, Italy (hosts, Group A), England (hosts, Group D), Germany (hosts, Group F), Spain (hosts, Group E), Ukraine.</p>

      <p>Clarke and Co will discover their play-off semi-final opponents tomorrow with one of Bulgaria, Israel, Hungary or Romania making the trip to Hampden in the last four.</p>
      <p>If the Dark Blues reach the final they will face one of Norway or Serbia - with a draw determining who hosts the one-off game.</p>
      <p>The overall winner secures a spot at Euro 2020 and will be seeded in Pot 4.</p>
