      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/communist-party-of-india-marxist">Communist Party of India-Marxist </a>(CPI-M) has extended its support to a proposed countrywide strike of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bpcl">BPCL </a>employees on November 28 against the privatisation of the public sector enterprise, saying that the move is "completely detrimental to India's sovereignty."</p>
      <p>"The Polit Bureau of the CPI(M) extends its support to the countrywide strike by all unions of <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/bpcl">BPCL </a>on November 28. The CPI(M) has already announced a month-long campaign against privatisation of PSUs in December," said the party in a statement on Thursday.</p>
      <p>"In order to meet its profligate expenditure, mostly on propaganda and spin, this government is selling public assets to meet a target of raising Rs 1.10 lakh crore. In the process, productive and value-creating PSUs are being sold to promote their crony corporates to gain strategic control of the Indian economy," added the party.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) accorded 'in-principle' approval for strategic disinvestment in five central public-sector enterprises including the Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL).</p>
      <p>The party said the strategic disinvestment of public sector enterprises was like "selling the family silver to meet daily expenditure inevitably ruining the family".</p>
      <p>Apart from the BPCL, the Union Cabinet has also approved the sale of its stake in four other public sector enterprises -- Shipping Corporation of India and the Container Corporation of India, THDCIL and the North Eastern Electric Power Corporation. The government will also cease the management control of these PSUs.</p>
