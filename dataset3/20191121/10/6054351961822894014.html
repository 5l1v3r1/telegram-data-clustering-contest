      <h1>Tory Lanez: 'Rap Is In A Horrible Place'</h1>

      <p>New York, NY – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53423/title.tory-lanez-throws-punch-in-video-of-alleged-altercation-with-love-hip-hop-cast-member">Tory Lanez</a> recently stopped by Hot 97’s <i>Ebro In The Morning</i> to discuss a myriad of topics, including his <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.3570/title.review-tory-lanez-chixtape-5-is-a-decent-sonic-love-letter-to-00s-rb"><i>Chixtape 5</i></a> project. At one point, the conversation pivoted to the state of rap and the Canadian artist didn’t hesitate to express his disappointment in the seemingly homogenous rap landscape.</p>
      <p>“I look at rap right now and rap is in a horrible place,” he said. “It’s in a horrible place. You gotta look at it right now. What’s the best rap song out right now? I just feel like rap has gotten to a repetitive place. There’s just one sound right now and it sounds like it’s out of an automated box.</p>
      <p>“There’s a lot of other dudes who I feel like come up — of course we all draw sounds and inspirations from each other, like I’ve been one of the people who’ve done that too  — but at the same time, I feel like when everybody starts to sound the same … and I keep hearing the same drum and the same kick and the same snare, and the same hi-hats, the same patterns, it gets to a point where I start saying, ‘This shit’s in a bad place right now.'”</p>

      <p>Lanez also gave credit to <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/videos/id.27911/title.young-thug-just-how-it-is">Young Thug</a> who he says is responsible for “75 percent” of the “rap style that’s going on right now.”</p>
      <p>“I don’t think we shine enough light on Thugger for that,” he added. “There’s a lot of copying of Thugger. It’s so important for him to shed light on it because of the fact that people just have been taking his style so blatantly and not showing the respect.”</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the interview, they discuss <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53526/title.lil-xan-admits-to-relapsing-back-on-painkillers">Lil Xan’s</a> face tattoos, why he chose Ashanti for the album cover and more.</p>
