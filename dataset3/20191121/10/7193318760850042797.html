      <p>GUTHRIE — He may not be Jimmy Stewart, but for the second straight year, Joshua McGowen will play one of the most iconic movie characters in cinema history, but in a radio play that is actually a theatrical production.</p>
      <p>"It's a great honor. It definitely would be considered a dream role of mine. I think George Bailey is such a complex character. He's not your typical hero," McGowen said. "He's trying to overcome all these obstacles that keep getting in his way. But what he has to learn is that being a hero and fulfilling your dreams may not necessarily mean your own dreams. But it might be serving your fellow human beings. ... Once he finally realizes he has been living just the life that he needs, it's a beautiful thing."</p>
      <p>The story of George Bailey will continue to touch many lives when The Pollard Theatre stages its encore production of “It's a Wonderful Life: A Live Radio Play” from Nov. 29-Dec. 22 on its downtown Guthrie stage.</p>
      <p>“When it went over well last year, we kind of breathed a sigh of relief,” said W. Jerome Stevenson, The Pollard's producing artistic director. “You can’t go wrong with that story, and it’s really a question of, ‘Do they want to see it in this style, this new format?’ But that, I think, kind of lends itself to Guthrie and to the time period of the city and the look and feel of it.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shelving a favorite</b>
      </p>
      <p>The theater shelved its traditional yuletide title, “A Territorial Christmas Carol,” last season after the 2018 deaths of founding company member James Ong, who had played Ebenezer Scrooge since 2000, and playwright Stephen P. Scott, who penned the Charles Dickens adaptation for The Pollard in 1987.</p>
      <p>"There'd be a great deal of mourning in the show, which is not why people come to a Christmas show. While it may have been cathartic for us, it wasn't gonna be something that we wanted to share with our audience for Christmas. So, it became really clear we needed to get away from it," Stevenson said.</p>
      <p>The search for a holiday title with similar themes led to Joe Landry's adaptation of Frank Capra's classic 1946 film starring Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.</p>
      <p>"The American version of the 'Christmas Carol' story is a 'It's a Wonderful Life' ... and I've always been a huge fan of that piece. So, when I came across it as a radio play, I thought, 'This is ideal,' " said Stevenson, who will direct the yuletide show for the second year.</p>
      <p>"This version of it allows us to do kind of what The Pollard does really well, which is focus in on narrative, focus in on relationship between characters."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blurring reality</b>
      </p>
      <p>Landry's adaptation frames the familiar film story as a live 1940s radio broadcast of the tale of George Bailey, a downtrodden small-town businessman who is visited by an angel who shows him what life would have been like if he'd never been born.</p>
      <p>"It's set up to where the audience is actually the studio audience during a live recording of the play. So, it's set in the same period, and last year we entered from the back of the house as the actors that are going to be portraying these classic characters. And then there's the radio announcer ... and it's just very much how it would be like listening to a radio play," McGowen said.</p>
      <p>During the course of the show, though, the lines between reality and magic blur.</p>
      <p>"There is something kind of interesting and charming about the way that it is structured, because you get to the latter half of this play and you're 100 percent not sure ... whether they're just kind of speaking the lines or they're living this experience," Stevenson said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Transporting audiences</b>
      </p>
      <p>After 30 years of flocking to The Pollard for its "A Territorial Christmas Carol," Stevenson said audiences graciously supported last year's production of "It's a Wonderful Life." The plan is to eventually return to "A Territorial Christmas Carol," with "It's a Wonderful Life" perhaps swapping into The Pollard's holiday slot every few years. The theater is using the time away from its traditional title to look at revamping its "Christmas Carol" set.</p>
      <p>"The set’s really old, and it’s a wood set. And it gets stored in a storage unit, and we pull it out and Swiss-cheese it back together. ... We've got safety issues that we want to concern ourselves with. Plus, it might be time to rethink the production and give it a new edge and a new look," Stevenson said. "I feel like it's going to be a pretty high priority ... that we gotta get 'Christmas Carol' back."</p>
      <p>For McGowen, who played young Scrooge and the miser's cheery nephew Fred for many years in "A Territorial Christmas Carol," the change in yuletide tales has been refreshing.</p>
      <p>"'It's a Wonderful Life,' I think, is just as much of an important, classic tale as 'Christmas Carol' is. And the response we've gotten has been wonderful," he said. "I'm very honored and excited to be back at it again and maybe to find even some more elements of George that I didn't have last year. I love Jimmy Stewart ... and as an actor-character piece, it's so rich."</p>
