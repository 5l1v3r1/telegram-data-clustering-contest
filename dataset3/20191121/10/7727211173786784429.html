      <p>Dr Hilary Jones has been touting the benefits of sex, alcohol and classic chicken soup to help cure a cold.</p>
      <p>Runny noses, tickly coughs, cramps and genuinely feeling unwell can really make us feel down.</p>
      <p>And with no real cure for the common cold, we often just have to wait it out.</p>
      <p>But, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> doctor told viewers of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/lorraine-kelly">Lorraine Kelly</a> that there are some 'old wives' tales' that can actually shift the symptoms.</p>
      <p>Busting some myths he said there is some research to suggest chicken soup can help with a cold, along with whisky to soothe a sore throat.</p>
      <p>The 66-year-old said: "Whisky, honey and lemon can help, and whisky is an antiseptic so can soothe the throat and can help you sleep, but obviously you don't want too much of it."</p>
      <p>He also said preventative measures will stop you getting a cold in the first place, he said: "Having sex can boost your immune system - a study that found if you have sex once a week, it can help.</p>
      <p>"Fish can prevent flu because it is rich in vitamin D - the sunshine vitamin - and a lot of people are deficient in vitamin D, especially in winter."</p>
      <p>He also said rumors that going to bed with wet hair can cause a cold are unfounded, adding: " A cold comes from viruses and everyone is different, if you don't have immunity from that virus, you are going to get it."</p>
