      <h1>Convicted Murderer Henry Segura Faces Death Penalty, But He Won’t Put Up a Fight</h1>

      <p>Murder defendant <b>Henry Segura </b>told the court Thursday that he didn’t want his attorneys to put up a case to save him from the death penalty. The defense said they won’t put up an opening statement, call any witnesses, or make a closing argument.</p>
      <p>Judge <b>James Hankinson </b>allowed this approach, but said he must still review evidence.</p>

      <p>Strictly speaking, this kind of situation makes the case tee-ball for the state. Nonetheless, they kept things concise Thursday morning, and declined to present evidence.</p>

      <p>Segura was convicted Tuesday in the first-degree murders of girlfriend <b>Brandi Peters</b>, their 3-year-old son <b>JaVante Segura</b>, and <b>Tamiyah </b>and<b> Taniyah Peters</b>, the adult victim’s twin 6-year-old daughters who were not the defendant’s kids. He did it because he owed over $20,000 for the care of his son, prosecutors said. This was his second trial. Jurors in the first were deadlocked 8-4 in favor of acquittal. At the opening statement for Thursday’s penalty phase, the state presented aggravating factors (the children were younger than 12 years of age; the murders were done for pecuniary gain).</p>
