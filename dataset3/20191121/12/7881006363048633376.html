      <p><b>New Delhi:</b> Yoga Guru Ramdev on Thursday welcomed Home Minister's Amit Shah recent statement on the implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) saying, "this will be beneficial for maintaining national security" and added that the issue should not be "politicised".</p>
      <p>Speaking to ANI in New Delhi, Ramdev said, "Even if a single person is staying in India illegally it is dangerous for the national security and the unity of the country. We must protect our country. This (NRC) will be beneficial for maintaining national security. NRC is not a social and a political issue and hence should not be politicised."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Union Minister Shah had stated in the Parliament that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) process will be carried out across India, clarifying that there would be no discrimination on the basis of religion.</p>
      <p>The statement of Shah led to mixed reactions from various political quarters with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee saying that "NRC will not be implemented, keep this in mind. There is nothing to worry about."</p>
      <p>In the final NRC list published on August 31, a total of 3,11,21,004 persons were found eligible for inclusion in the list leaving out 19,06,657 persons, including those who did not submit their claims in Assam.</p>
