        <b>Diego Costa will not play again until 2020 after having neck surgery, heightening concerns in front of goal for Atletico boss Diego Simeone.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Atletico Madrid striker Diego Costa is set for a spell on the sidelines after undergoing neck surgery.</p>
      <p>In a statement issued on their official website, Atleti confirmed Costa had an operation on his herniated cervical disc on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The procedure was successful but normally requires a recovery time of two to three months.</p>
      <p>Speaking earlier this week, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo insisted there were no plans to sign a January replacement for Costa in the event of surgery.</p>
      <p>“No, because we already tried to sign [a striker] at the beginning of the season and you know that you have to sell someone to be able to buy someone,” he told AS, citing his club’s salary limit.</p>
      <p>“So, I don’t know. In principle, no. We have a fantastic team and fantastic strikers who score many goals.”</p>
      <p>Record signing Joao Felix is in line to boost Diego Simeone’s attack by returning from a sprained ankle when Atletico visit Granada in LaLiga on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Like Costa, the Portugal forward has only two top-flight goals to his name this term. Alvaro Morata leads the way with five for a team that have 15 goals in 13 LaLiga outings so far</p>
      <p>Atleti are third in the table, a point behind Barcelona and Real Madrid having played a game more.</p>
