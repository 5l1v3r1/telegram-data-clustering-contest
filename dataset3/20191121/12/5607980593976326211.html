      <p>The <b>One Mix 3 Pro</b> is the first mini-laptop to feature a 10th-gen Intel Comet Lake processor. The 8.4 inch laptop with an Intel Core i5-10210Y quad-core processor <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/10/one-mix-3-pro-mini-laptop-with-intel-comet-lake-hits-japan-for-979.html">went on sale in China in October</a>, and now it’s available internationally.</p>
      <p>GeekBuying is selling the <a href="https://fave.co/2qphrBw">One Mix 3 Pro for $960</a> (or $940 if you use the coupon code Mix3Pro at checkout).</p>

      <p>That makes the One Mix 3 Pro one of the pricier mini-laptops on the market. But it’s also one of the most powerful. In addition to featuring a <a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/196454/intel-core-i5-10210y-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-00-ghz.html">7 watt, 4-core/8-thread processor</a>, the portable computer features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>8.4 inch, 2560 x 1600 pixel touchscreen display</li>
        <li>16GB LPDDR3 memory</li>
        <li>512GB PCIe SSD storage</li>
        <li>360-degree hinge</li>
        <li>Support for an optional pen (4096 levels of pressure sensitivity)</li>
        <li>Backlit keyboard</li>
        <li>Fingerprint reader</li>
        <li>Optical touch sensor (instead of a touchpad)</li>
        <li>Micro HDMI</li>
        <li>USB 3.0 Type-A</li>
        <li>USB Type-C</li>
        <li>3.5mm audio</li>
        <li>microSD card reader</li>
        <li>Aluminum body</li>
        <li>8600 mAh battery</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Honestly, the $1000 price tag wouldn’t be that unusual for a 13 inch or larger Comet Lake laptop with a high-res display, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. It just seems a little high for a computer that you’re most likely going to treat as a secondary device rather than a primary PC.</p>

      <p>Measuring 8″ x 5.1″ x 0.6″ and weighing about 1.4 pound, this is a notebook that’s a little too large to slide into a pocket, but still much smaller than most other laptop computers. The appeal of mini-laptops is largely that you can take them places you might not take other PCs. So I don’t typically recommend anyone use them as their <i>only </i>computer… although in recent years the keyboards, displays, and processors have gotten good enough that I probably wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to try.</p>
      <p>If the overall design looks familiar, that’s because the One Mix 3 Pro is basically a One Mix 3 Yoga with a new processor and top-tier memory and storage specs.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year I posted a <a href="https://liliputing.com/2019/06/one-mix-3-yoga-8-4-inch-mini-laptop-review.html">review of the original One Mix 3</a>, and I was pretty impressed with the keyboard, design, and overall performance… although underwhelmed by the battery life (which tended to only last for around 4-5 hours at a time).</p>

      <p>I haven’t had a chance to test the new Pro model yet, so I can’t say how it compares in terms of performance or battery life. I suspect the move to a quad-core chip may help in some areas, but I wouldn’t expect any enormous improvements since both versions of the laptop are using low-power, 7-watt Intel Core Y-series chips with Intel UHD integrated graphics.</p>
      <p>That said, the One Mix 3 Pro isn’t just the first mini-laptop to feature a Comet Lake chip. It’s one of the first computers of <i>any</i> size to feature the a Comet Lake-Y processor, so it’ll be interesting to what improvements, if any, the new chip brings to this tiny laptop.</p>
      <p>GeekBuying is selling two versions of the One Mix 3 Pro, by the way. You can get it with an <a href="https://fave.co/2qphrBw">English keyboard</a> or a <a href="https://fave.co/2qphrBw">Japanese keyboard</a>.</p>
      <p>Both versions are priced at $960… and the Mix3Pro coupon code will knock $20 off the price of either one.</p>
      <p>Hopefully we’ll also see lower-priced versions in the future. I suspect a Comet Lake + 8GB RAM + 256GB storage model would be good enough for many users, especially if it cost $100 – $200 less than the 16GB/512GB version.</p>
