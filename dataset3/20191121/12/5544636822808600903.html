      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/sports">Barcelona</a> defender, Gerard Pique says he is planning to see out his current contract at the club through to 2022, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>The World Cup winner who returned to his roots in Catalunya back in 2008 after spending four years with Manchester United also said that Barca will be the final club of his career.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old has gone on to take in over 500 appearances for Barca, while collecting numerous major trophies with club and country.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191121/471773780058/pique-barca-futuro-contrato-2022-retirada.html"><i>Mundo Deportivo</i></a>: “I have always said my last team will be Barca.</p>
      <p>“I have absolutely no intention of wearing any other shirt because… I have been a ‘Cule’ all my life. For me, being at Barca is the biggest dream of all.</p>
      <p>“My intention is to get to 2022, but I don’t have a crystal ball and I don’t know if I’m going to be able to do it.</p>
      <p>“If I see that I lose importance or see that I am not at the [required] level, I have no problem leaving earlier.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it will happen because I know myself and I am able to endure until 2022, but you never know.”</p>
      <h3>Barcelona Leading Bayern Munich, Real Madrid, Man Utd in Race for Pochettino</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are both considering moves for Mauricio Pochettino following his <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/19/epl-tottenham-sack-manager-pochettino/">departure from Tottenham Hotspur</a>, with the Catalan side reportedly in pole position to secure his signature.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was relieved of his duties and <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/tottenham-appoints-jose-mourinho-as-head-coach/">replaced by José Mourinho</a> earlier in the week, but there is expected to be no shortage of interest in him.</p>
      <p>According to ​The Sun, both ​Barcelona and ​Bayern are incredibly keen on recruiting Pochettino, but it is the Spanish side who are leading the race for his acquisition.</p>
      <p>Barcelona have doubts over the future of current boss Ernesto Valverde. He may have led them to first in ​La Liga, but Valverde has struggled to replicate that success in Europe, having watched his side crash out the ​Champions League in spectacular fashion in the last two seasons.</p>
      <p>La Blaugrana have again struggled in the competition this year, labouring to draws against both ​Borussia Dortmund and Slavia Prague, and there is a belief that they could move on from Valverde if he fails to improve.</p>
      <p>If Barcelona do choose to cut ties with their boss, they are expected to move for Pochettino, who managed to lead Spurs to the Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>He is understood to be close friends with club president Josep Maria Bartomeu, although his loyalty to former side Espanyol could ultimately stop him from even considering a switch to Camp Nou, and has said in the past that he would never manage Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Should that be the case, ​Bayern may jump to the front of the queue for his signature. They are still looking for a permanent replacement for Niko Kovač, and it is thought that they are incredibly eager to speak to Pochettino now that he is available immediately.</p>
