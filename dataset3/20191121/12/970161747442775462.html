      <p>When you’re starting out on a new venture, a few premature detonations can be easily forgiven.</p>
      <p>So we’re hoping Elon Musk isn’t feeling too embarrassed about the explosion of his Starship – a rocket that’s designed to carry humans to Mars and beyond.</p>
      <p>The Mk1 prototype was undergoing a ‘cryogenic pressure test’ at SpaceX’s facilities near the South Texas village of Boca Chica when the spacecraft went kaboom.</p>
      <p>Witnesses said the top of the craft shot almost 500 feet into the air and videos show plumes of smoke pouring from the top of the gigantic spaceship.</p>
      <p>‘The purpose of today’s test was to pressurise systems to the max, so the outcome was not completely unexpected,’ a SpaceX spokesperson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>‘There were no injuries, nor is this a serious setback.’</p>

      <p>Musk took to Twitter to tell fans that his firm will now focus its attention on a new Mk3 Starship prototype.</p>

      <p>‘This had some value as a manufacturing pathfinder, but flight design is quite different,’ he wrote.</p>
      <p>Starship was previously known as BFR (Big Falcon Rocket or the Big F***ing Rocket).</p>
      <p>The 50 metre-tall Starship will one day fly atop a booster called the Super Heavy and take astronauts to the moon as well as the Red Planet.</p>
      <p>Musk hopes to send a Mk3 version of Starship into space next year, propelled by the mega-powerful Super Heavy.</p>
      <p>He now believes humanity will be able to<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/24/elon-musk-doesnt-know-whether-wants-conquer-mars-moon-10038601/"> found a permanent settlement on the Red Planet in just over three decades.</a></p>
