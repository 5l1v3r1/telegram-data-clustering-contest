      <p>Malik Muhammad Jayasi’s ‘Padmavat’ is one of the most celebrated classics of pre-modern Hindi. Because the author Jayasi was a Sufi, this work has also been considered an allegory for divine love. Written in 16th century, like a host of historical narratives in other Indian languages in pre-modern period, weaves strands of history and imagination in a seamless way. Though it is deeply human love story narrated against the background of the supernatural, mythology is used to deepen real life happenings.</p>
      <p>Purushottam Agrawal’s eminently readable and brilliantly crafted book on ‘Padmavat’ is unique in many ways. Apart from giving a gist of the content and form, this colossal work which enables the reader not only to follow the beautiful story through its surprising twists and turns, but also smell and savour its poetic flavours.</p>
      <p>The significance of this book goes even further. Refusing to be a passive summary of a classic, it locates the uniqueness of its philosophical essence in its own times, at the same time relating it to our own concerns today. The book assumes significance in the light of the recent controversy about the film, ‘Padmavat’. It was the conflict between history and faith. Aggarwal, though aware of both faith and history, sifts grain from chaff and poetic truth and beauty from Jayasi’s work.</p>
      <p>The most invaluable aspect of Agrawal’s introduction to Jayasi’s work is his analysis of the theme of love in this story.</p>
      <p>Erotic love came to be stigmatised by ascetic faiths like Buddhism and Jainism. Though Buddhism became highly inclusive in its Mahayana phase, the old Buddhism saw erotic love as a trap, as is clear from Buddha’s parting instruction in Mahaparinibbana Suttam of Deegha Nikita, to Ananda: ‘Don’t look at a woman’. In Jaina sacred stories, Thirthankaras, highly awakened beings, enter the ascetic path only after exhausting all their desire for worldly enjoyment. In both the ascetic systems, physical love and spiritual liberation are antagonistic to each other.</p>
      <p>Buddhism and Jainism became highly influential faiths because, among other things, of the royal patronage extended to them. Later, other spiritual schools of India like Vedanta, Shaivism and Vaishnavism, not initially antagonistic to the erotics, imbibed from the ascetic faiths taboos on erotic desire. Ascetic faiths taught the wisdom of abstinence. But that would not work for the majority of people. The schools of Tantra and Bhakti( like Sufism) discovered alternative ways of dealing with the problem.</p>
      <p>Tantrik approach is one of inclusion. Instead of abjuring desire it uses it as means of freedom from conditioned existence. Bhakti on the other hand discovered for the most part the path of sublimation by directing erotic love to one’s isthadevata, beloved deity.</p>
      <p>Though there was a stream of Madhura Bhakti represented by Chandidas and Jayadeva where human love was metonymically related to divine love. In other words, divine love is not substitute, but an extension of human love. But most Bhakti saints opted out of this and joined the chorus of ascetics in hurling accusations and vilifying human love.</p>
      <p>Agrawal,argues that Jayasi’s work ‘Padmavat’ is a Sufi allegory in spite of the fact that the author was a devout Sufi. If that had been the case, argues Agrawal, the characters depicted would not have been so real and rounded. The love between Padmavati and Ratan Singh is basically the intense love between man and woman. In the degree of passion it at times transcends the human. Ratan Singh has to become a love- yogi before Padmavati reciprocates. In spite of his attachment, he does not want to possess her until he is sure she too longs for him. So his emotion for her is different than that of Alauddin Khilji, who wants her at any cost and without caring how she feels. Ratan Singh on the other hand is willing to give up his life for her. At the same time, Jayasi gives an uninhibited poetic account of the physical love between the couple. Isn’t it the same with Kalidasa’s description of love between Shiva and Parvati in ‘Kumara Sambhavam’? Jayasi did not even present this love as completely monogamous in case of Ratan Singh. He already has a wife Nagmati with whom Padmavati later fights fierce battles. Ratan Singh unlike Alauddin has no other women except these two in his love.</p>
      <p>The greatest sensitivity that Jayasi shows is in the depiction of Padmavati’s love and Alauddin’s character. Alauddin is no angel, but not a satan either.</p>
      <p>These are Jayasi’s last words:</p>
      <p>‘Where is the beautiful queen Padmavati herself? Nothing but the story survives in the world.’</p>
      <p>That story comes alive before our eyes through Agrawal’s renderings. The book is enriched by the introduction and illustration by Devdutt Pattanaik</p>
