      <p>Camera placement has been one of the biggest differing factors of phones in 2019. We have seen hole-punch notches, slider notches, flip cameras and pop-up cameras. The Honor 9X is one of the most prevalent phones to feature a pop-up selfie camera, which makes room for a large notch-free display. With this being a pretty desirable feature among consumers, we put together the top three pop-up camera phones under $300.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Honor 9X</h3>
      <h4>€ 299.00</h4>
      <p>The Honor 9X is the first in the X-series line to feature a pop-up camera. This pop-up camera has a fully motorized design. When the selfie mode is activated, the camera will quickly rise from the top of the phone. To really enhance the full-screen notch-free effect of the phone, Honor fitter a larger display into the phone at 6.59″. The end result is a large full screen phone with a very convenient motorized pop-up camera.</p>

      <h3>Huawei y9 Prime</h3>
      <h4>$242.50</h4>
      <p>The Huawei y9 Prime is a very budget-friendly phone designed for people who are looking for large screen size and decent specs. This phone is very similar to the above mentioned Honor 9X. The large 6.59″ display stretches from one edge of the phone to the other, without any intrusive notch or sliding mechanism. The pop-up camera is mechanical and reveals itself when selfie mode is activated in the camera app.</p>
