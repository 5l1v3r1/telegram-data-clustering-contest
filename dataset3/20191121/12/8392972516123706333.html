      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:17:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:17</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>Presenter Phillip Schofield has revealed his fears that he and Holly Willoughby are set to be replaced on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a>.</p>
      <p>As the pair introduced the segments on today's (21.11.19) episode, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly</a> explained that they had a robot in the studio capable of drawing pictures and learning from its interactions.</p>
      <p>Holly said: "She's one of the most sophisticated robots ever created. Sophia will be answering our questions later, but in the meantime she's keeping herself busy. What are you drawing there, Sophia?"</p>

      <p>As the camera cut to the robot doing a sketch, it replied: "It's a surprise. You'll have to wait and see."</p>
      <p>Looking concerned, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phil</a> told Holly: "It's the beginning of the end. There'll be two of those presenting this in a few years' time."</p>

      <p>Later in the programme, the co-hosts got to meet Sophia face to face as she joined them on the couch alongside her creator, David Hanson.</p>
      <p>Holly said: "I can't keep my eyes of her. It's just the most extraordinary thing. She's so realistic!"</p>
      <aside>There'll be two of those presenting this in a few years' time.</aside>
      <p>Her creator explained: "Sophia is a robot that looks human as a platform for investigating embodied cognition, so she serves a lot of AI research and also some applications development where she can help people through therapy.</p>

      <p>"She's also an artistic expression. I have a background as an artist and I sculpted her face and also, we developed her personality. So we depict a human - she's one part science, in other words, and one part fiction. She's science fiction."</p>
      <p>But Phil went on to express his fears, telling David: "But the thing is, there are some scientists who are deeply, deeply concerned about where we're going with this.</p>

      <p>"Because, maybe it just takes one new invention, one tiny thing that you guys haven't seen... and suddenly deep within that brain, she does begin to think."</p>
      <p>In a tone far removed from the lighter moments that see <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/this-mornings-holly-willoughby-and-phil-schofield-have-giggling-fit-over-naughty-innuendo/">Holly and Phil descending into fits of the giggles</a>, he added: "There is a potential sinister side to this."</p>
