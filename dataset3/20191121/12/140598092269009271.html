      <p>Marcus Rashford has insisted Ole Gunnar Solskjaer remains the perfect fit for Manchester United, despite Mauricio Pochettino’s sudden availability <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/jose-mourinhos-return-mauricio-pochettinos-release-dual-shadow/">placing fresh scrutiny on the Old Trafford manager</a>.</p>
      <p>United coveted Pochettino at the time of Solskjaer’s interim appointment last December only to install the Norwegian permanently after being impressed by his temporary spell in charge amid reluctance to foot a £34 million compensation package for the Tottenham Hotspur manager.</p>
      <p>Pochettino’s sacking by Spurs this week has now removed that obstacle and is likely to make the Argentine one of the hottest properties in management, with Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Paris St-Germain all admirers, along with United.</p>
      <p>But Rashford - who signed a new four-year contract with United in July and has become the focal point of the attack under Solskjaer - <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/20/message-tottenham-manchester-jose-mourinho-manager-know-story/">says the club are already in the best hands</a>.</p>
      <p>“There was no hesitation from me over signing a new contract,” said the England forward, who has nine goals in his past 10 games for club and country.</p>
      <p>“And it was the same for Ole as well - I could see where his head was at, where he wanted the club to be at and for me it was just a no-brainer.</p>
      <p>“We were on the same page and wanted the same things for the club. Ole is a great guy and he has the club's interests at heart so there’s not a better person for the job in my opinion.”</p>

      <p>United travel to Bramall Lane on Sunday on the back of five wins in six games in all competitions but they have taken just eight points from the past 21 available in the Premier League and need to beat Sheffield United - who are a point and two places above them in fifth - in pursuit of a top-four finish.</p>
      <p>Rashford says United are working towards long-term improvement under Solskjaer, whom he believes will need time to be remodel the squad to his liking.</p>
      <p>But Rashford believes United can still finish in the top four and win a trophy this term. They face League Two Colchester United in the League Cup quarter-finals next month and have already qualified for the Europa League knockout stages with two matches to spare.</p>
      <p>“Manchester United have always got to chase trophies,” he told Sky Sports. “I think it’s been 18 months [two-and-a-half years] since we won our last trophy so it’s been a while.</p>
      <p>“If we come out of this season with top four but without a trophy, I wouldn’t be happy. If we manage to get some trophies and get ourselves into the top four then, of course, it has been a successful season.</p>
      <p>“For me it is just about putting markers down for what we can do in the future because we know that this period is not going to change overnight, Ole’s not going to get what he wants overnight.</p>
      <p>“We have to bide our time and just be patient, as long as we keep working hard and believe in what we are doing - which I think the team do 100 per cent - then I think we will be fine.”</p>
