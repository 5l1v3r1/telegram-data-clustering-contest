      <p>“Why do Shannon Bream and Fox News waste airtime on Democrat Rep. Eric Swalwell, who recently left the Presidential Primaries having attained a grand number of ZERO in the polls,” Trump wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Swalwell, who was recently the subject of a <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/18/he-who-denied-it-eric-swalwell-denies-emitting-massive-fart-on-msnbc/">“fart-gate”</a> controversy during an MSNBC interview with Chris Matthews, appeared on Bream’s show in the 11:00 p.m. hour on Wednesday night to talk about the case for impeaching President Trump</p>
      <p>“I don’t even know how that is possible,” Trump commented. “Fox should stay with the people that got them there, not losers!”</p>
