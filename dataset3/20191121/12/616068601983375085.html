      <p>A Penticton family is again holding their unique “V2A” fundraiser for the homeless.</p>
      <p>Dave, Viv and Heather Lieskovsky have created small home Christmas ornaments out of leftover wood, flooring and paint for the past three years. The ornaments have been sold with proceeds going towards charities supporting the homeless.</p>
      <p>“This year’s edition of homes are once again made from leftover clay and glazes, so each one is completely unique, just like the people they represent,” Viv Lieskovsky said.</p>
      <p>“Penticton is home to many, including those who don’t have actual homes to live in. The fundraiser is based on Penticton’s postal code, V2A.  A postal code is something everyone has. Those who don’t have a postal code, likely don’t have a home.”</p>
      <p>Proceeds this year will go towards the Salvation Army. In the first three years of the fundraiser, $7,000 in cash donations have been generated. </p>
      <p>“The little homes can be used as holiday decorations, stocking stuffers, teacher gifts, hostess gifts, wine bottle tags or gift tags as great reminders that Penticton cares for those less fortunate in our community. This year there will also be other 'house' related gift items as well,” Lieskovsky said.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser will start Nov. 27 at Banks Travel's temporary location at 323 Main Street, Penticton (previously Grant King's). The little homes will be sold for a minimum $7 cash donation. Banks Travel is open Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturdays 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p>
