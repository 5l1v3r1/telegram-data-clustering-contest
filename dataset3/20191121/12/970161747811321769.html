      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> looked remarkably relaxed today as he was pictured for the first time since he was effectively sacked by the Queen.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York has now suspended work with most of his charities, organisations and military units because of the fallout from his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>He will, however, continue to work on the entrepreneurship initiative Pitch@Palace because it is a private venture, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/buckingham-palace/">Buckingham Palace</a> said this morning.</p>
      <p>The royal was pictured behind the wheel on Thursday morning driving out of his home, Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.</p>
      <p>Dressed in a suit and tie, he smiled and waved to photographers as he left the estate in Berkshire.</p>

      <p>Last night Prince Andrew announced he would step back from public duties for the ‘foreseeable future’ in an unprecedented move for a royal in modern times.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The bombshell declaration came after mounting pressure following his ‘car crash’ interview about his friendship with convicted sex offender Mr Epstein.</p>
      <p>His team had hoped the BBC interview would convince the general public of his innocence and honesty.</p>
      <p>However millions were left aghast as the Duke attempted to explain his relationship and why he stayed with the late Epstein after his release from prison on sex offence charges.</p>
      <p>In particular, he was roundly criticised for failing to show any remorse for Epstein’s dozens of young female victims.</p>
      <p>Today US lawyers acting for some of the victims said they wanted to speak to Prince Andrew about his friendship.</p>
      <p>Lisa Bloom said that as an attorney she had ‘the right’ to seek a statement from individuals she deemed to have ‘relevant information.’</p>

      <p>Businesses and other organisations have also announced they are terminating or reviewing their association with the royal after days of public outcry.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday night, the Queen’s second son, 59, quit royal duties saying the issue was becoming a ‘major distraction.’</p>
      <p>Royal sources said he was forced to act after the monarch and Prince Charles personally intervened.</p>
      <p>The Queen is said to have summoned Prince Andrew to Buckingham Palace yesterday and demanded he step down from public duties.</p>
      <p>The eighth-in-line to the throne was told he could write his own statement in an attempt to allow him to bow out gracefully.</p>

      <p>A source told the Daily Mail: ‘When the Queen and the Prince of Wales stand firm together they are a pretty formidable combination in terms of getting things done.’</p>
      <p>The wider Royal Family were informed and a statement put out just before 6pm after days of trying to insist it was business as normal.</p>

      <p>In the past few days, more than 20 companies and charities, including Barclays, KPMG and the English National Ballet, have distanced themselves from the Prince.</p>
      <p>Backers for his key public initiative’s such as the entrepreneurs scheme, Pitch@Palace, began to openly withdraw their support.</p>
      <p>This morning, Buckingham Palace said Prince Andrew wanted to continue working there but would do so privately without their support.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman said: ‘He will continue to work on Pitch but will look at how to do that outside and entirely separate from the palace.’</p>
      <p>It is unclear if he still plans to travel to Bahrain on Saturday for a Pitch event after he cancelled a trip to South Yorkshire to visit flood affected towns.</p>
      <p>There is no time period specified for the Prince to be out of the limelight for.</p>
      <p>He is likely to attend events such as the Christmas Day service, Trooping The Colour and Remembrance Sunday.</p>
      <p>Sources said his decision is unlikely to affects his daughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, who undertake occasional royal duties.</p>

      <p>The Prince is not publicly-funded and receives an undisclosed stipend from the Queen’s Privy Purse, believed to be in the region of £250,000.</p>

      <p>The taxpayer had been funding his travel while on royal duties.</p>
      <p>There are also likely to be redundancies in his private office following what has been described as a ‘period of transition’.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew is the only one of the Queen’s children to have accommodation and an office at Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p>He inherited Royal Lodge from the Queen Mother and spent £8.5 million on a refurbishment.</p>
      <p>It is just a short drive from the piece of land on which his marital home Sunninghill Park used to stand.</p>
      <p>A Kazakh billionaire paid £15 million for it, £3 million more than the asking price.</p>
