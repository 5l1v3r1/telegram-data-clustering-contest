      <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> are 'in love' with Peter Barlow after he desperately tried to help his brother Daniel Osbourne.</p>
      <p>Over the last few weeks, viewers have seen Daniel grieving for his wife Sinead, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-heartbroken-as-sinead-dies/">who sadly passed away from cancer</a>.</p>
      <p>After her death, Daniel decided to go away for a while and had to be convinced to come home by his half-brother Peter.</p>

      <p>However, this week things got worse for Daniel.</p>
      <aside>Peter Barlow I love you.</aside>
      <p>During <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-sinead-is-laid-to-rest/">Sinead's funeral</a>, Daniel's flat was robbed and the burglar took Daniel's laptop which contained precious videos that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-in-awe-of-katie-mcglynn-as-sinead-films-video-messages-for-bertie/">Sinead had recorded for their son Bertie</a>.</p>
      <p>In last night's episodes (November 20 2019), Daniel grew angry at the police for not contacting him further about the robbery, however Craig offered to take him to pawn shops to have a look for the laptop to avoid Daniel kicking up a fuss at the station.</p>

      <p>But instead of waiting for Craig, Daniel took matters into his own hands and went looking at pawn shops alone.</p>
      <p>After he found a laptop which looked like his in a shop, he began smashing the place up when the shop owner refused to let him look at the computer unless he was buying it.</p>
      <p>After the shopkeeper pushed his panic button, the police, including Sinead's cousin Craig, turned up and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-spoilers-daniel-gets-arrested/">arrested Daniel</a>.</p>
      <p>While Daniel was being held at the station, Peter pleaded with the shop owner to drop the charges against Daniel by explaining about Sinead's death and the subsequent robbery.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It was then revealed the laptop had been brought in a few weeks ago by a regular customer, so likely wasn't Daniel's.</p>
      <p>Luckily Peter's words managed to get through and the charges were dropped, meaning Daniel wouldn't be in legal trouble and wouldn't be looked into by social services.</p>
      <p>Fans were left swooning over Peter the hero.</p>
