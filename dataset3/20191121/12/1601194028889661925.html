      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/jorge-masvidal">Jorge Masvidal</a> has been riding a wave of momentum in 2019 that has put him in the conversation for "Fighter of the year". With knockout victories over <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/darren-till">Darren Till</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/ben-askren">Ben Askren</a>, followed by a doctor stoppage finish of Nate Diaz in one of the most highly-publicized fights of the year, it's clear that his stock has risen higher than it ever has before.</p>
      <p>A name that has popped up to Masvidal as a potential next opponent is Conor McGregor, but Masvidal rubbished the idea of a fight against him in the UFC 244 post-fight press conference, calling the Irishman a "midget" and warning him not to take that fight.</p>
      <p>He would, of course, be open to it as it would mean the "most zeroes" in his paycheque - something that Masvidal has been open about. He trains at American Top Team, run by Dan Lambert, who was recently interviewed by <i><a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/exclusive-interviews/att-owner-wants-conor-mcgregor-but-believes-nick-diaz-will-be-next-for-jorge-masvidal">BJPenn.com</a></i>. The ATT Owner said that if it were up to him, a fight against Conor McGregor would be next as it's the biggest payday - but he certainly doesn't expect it:</p>
      <blockquote>“They are all big money fights but all different money fights. Jorge and the team made it clear he wants whatever has the most zeros at the end,”</blockquote>
      <p>Lambert said it's ironic that the biggest money fights for Masvidal don't involve the Welterweight Championship:</p>
      <blockquote>“He wants to make the money, to me, the biggest money fight is always Conor McGregor so if I had it my way, I’d have him fight Conor next. It is probably going to be Nick [Diaz], and it will get a lot of eyeballs. It is kind of ironic, the lesser money deal is the title fight.</blockquote>
      <p>He revealed that the only other person in the conversation for "Fighter of the year" is Israel Adesanya but said that he would give the edge to <i>Gamebred</i>. A fight against Conor McGregor would be a well-deserved payday for Masvidal but it seems like an unrealistic fight as of this writing.</p>
