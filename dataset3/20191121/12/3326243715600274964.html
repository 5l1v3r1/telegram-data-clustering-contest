      </ul>
      <h3>Opening Help on Mac</h3>
      <p>When you have Finder open, you can <b>access the Help system from your menu bar</b>, all the way to the right. If you have an app open, the Help button in the menu bar will take you to the help topics specific to that app instead.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>You can also access Help for certain sections in your System Preferences. If there is help available, you’ll see a <b>question mark</b> in the lower right corner of the window. The topics you see when you click the button will relate to the specific section you’re viewing.</p>
      <p>For instance, if you open <b>System Preferences</b>, select <b>Mouse</b>, and choose <b>Point &amp; Click</b>, when you click the question mark, the Help topics you see are for that exact area of Point &amp; Click for your Mouse.</p>

      <h3>Using Help in the menu bar</h3>
      <p>Obviously, when you click <b>Help</b> from the menu bar, you can pop in a search term. You also have the option to open macOS Help, if you prefer. But most times, using a keyword to search for what you need will get you the results you seek. Just click when you see what you need and the Help window will open.</p>

      <p>If the item you’re searching for is an option within the menu, you’ll see this and exactly where it resides when move your cursor over the item.</p>

      <h3>Using the Help window toolbar</h3>
      <p>When you have the Help window open, whether you open it with the button in the menu bar or question mark in <b>System Preferences</b>, you have some additional options.</p>
      <p>In the Help window toolbar at the top, from left to right, you have <b>arrows</b> you can use to go back to the previous page or forward again.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Next, you have a <b>Table of Contents</b> button. This is super handy for seeing an outline related to your search so you can jump to different areas if needed.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>If you’d like to <b>share</b> something from the Help section, the next button gives you your default sharing options. So if you’re helping out a friend or family member, you can share the Help topic with them.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Finally, you have a <b>search</b> box. If you want to look for something completely different or try to narrow down your search, just pop a word or phrase into the box and you’ll see suggestions.</p>

      <h3>Clicking links within Help</h3>
      <p>You’ll notice as you’re using the Help system that some words or phrases are linked (blue). And where you are directed when you click a link may change.</p>
      <p>Some links have a dotted underline. Those will show you a preview of what the word or phrase is referring to.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Other links will take you to another section of the Help system if there is a topic dedicated to it.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://media.idownloadblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Help-Link-to-Section.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>And still other links will open things for you such as the settings in System Preferences.</p>

      <p>So, pay attention to those linked words and phrases for additional help within the Help system.</p>
