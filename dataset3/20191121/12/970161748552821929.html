      <p>Hailey Baldwin slayed in Berlin as she headed to a swish Calvin Klein party without husband <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite the Sorry singer also appearing in a campaign for the brand alongside his wife, he was notably absent at the bash, held in the German capital.</p>
      <p>Not that the model seemed too fussed, as she rocked up solo at Musikbrauerei in an off-the-shoulder, black and white top, paired with fitted dark skinny jeans.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old completed the look with a pair of the highest, deep red heels.</p>
      <p>Hailey’s appearance comes after she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/selena-gomez-doesnt-care-justin-bieber-backlash-hailey-baldwin-slams-drama-following-lose-love-10973491/">forced to hit back at claims she had shaded Justin’s ex, Selena Gomez</a>, on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Because we’re back in 2015, apparently.</p>
      <p>It all kicked off when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/selena-gomez-sings-replaced-2-months-course-everyone-thinks-justin-bieber-10966857/">Selena released her new song, Lose You To Love Me</a>, last month – with fans suggesting the bop was about her ex.</p>

      <p>She can be heard singing about being ‘replaced’ in two months ‘like it was easy’, which some took as a dig at Justin, who got engaged to Kendall Jenner’s best friend last July, shortly after he broke things off with Selena.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Soon after the song dropped, Stephen Baldwin’s daughter shared a screenshot to her Instagram page of the song I’ll Kill You, by Summer Walker.</p>
      <p>Side note: A total banger.</p>
      <p>But her Instagram antics put her directly in the firing line, with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/selena-gomez-fans-convinced-hailey-baldwin-threatened-kill-lose-love-release-10967144/">fans adamant she was throwing shade at Selena</a>, threatening to ‘kill her’.</p>
      <p>Yes, seriously.</p>

      <p>Hailey soon hit back at all the drama and denied the accusations in a now-deleted comment, insisting: ‘Please stop with this nonsense… there is no “response”, this is complete BS.’</p>
      <p>Discussing the emotional song, the Wolves singer told Radio Disney she never wants to be inauthentic.</p>
      <p>‘I wrote this song over a year ago and it’s obviously a very emotional song for me but it’s interesting to see how far I’ve come from that point to now,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘And me sharing my story is exactly what I’ve always done, because I can’t be inauthentic, I can’t pretend that I’m not going through something when it’s obvious that I had been.</p>
      <p>‘It’s one of those songs where I feel it’s out, it’s released, and I hope that girls and guys all over the world can feel supported. Because that’s a feeling everyone has felt.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘That was something that I needed to do for myself, regardless of what was going to come after.’</p>
      <p>So, that’s that then.</p>
