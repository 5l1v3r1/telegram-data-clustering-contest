      <p>The State Highways department on Thursday began laying of bituminous macadam on Vannankoil-Manikandam Road as part of development of the stretch as a major link between Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway and Tiruchi-Dindigul National Highway.</p>
      <p>The development of the 4.4 km-long road would help vehicles traversing between the two highways avoid entering Tiruchi city and save about 13 km.</p>
      <p>The rural road, which had long been in a state of neglect, was recently widened by the Highways department. Its width that was just 3.75 metres was increased to seven metres from Vannankoil to Manikandam.</p>
      <p>The development of the road involved construction of 14 culverts. The project was taken up at a total cost of â‚¹6 crore under the Comprehensive Road Infrastructure Development Programme.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Minister for Backward Classes and Minorities Welfare S. Valarmathi inaugurated the bituminous macadam laying work.</p>
      <p>A senior Highways official said the work would be completed by month-end.</p>
      <p>The development of the road assumes significance as it would bring relief to motorists in the wake of delay in execution of the by-pass road connecting Tiruchi-Madurai, Tiruchi-Dindigul and Tiruchi-Karur Highways from Panchapur to Thindukarai by National Highways Authority of India.</p>
