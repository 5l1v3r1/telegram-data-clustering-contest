      <h1>This New York hotel suite is designed entirely around hit Christmas movie Elf</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:10:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>They say the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear. That’s as may be, but it probably helps to be surrounded by toys, presents and decorations, inspired in every aspect by one of our most beloved Christmas movies.</p>
      <p>Festive favourite Elf – the tale of Buddy, a human raised in the North Pole who must journey to New York to find his father – came out in 2003 and the Will Ferrell-fronted flick quickly became a seasonal staple.</p>

      <p>Now Manhattan’s Wyndham Midtown 45 is transforming one of its hotel suites into an Eden for Elf-lovers, rammed with all Buddy’s favourite things. Hundreds of cut-out snowflakes hang from the ceiling, the walls are covered with ribbon-covered wrapping paper, and a playlist of seasonal songs awaits you on the speaker system.</p>
      <p>The kitchen is particularly tinselled, and comes stocked with Buddy’s four main food groups – candy, candy canes, candy corn and maple syrup. For particularly sweet-toothed visitors, there’s also the ingredients for the character’s trademark dish, spaghetti-a-la-Buddy – pasta with syrup, pop tarts and marshmallows.</p>

      <p>The bathroom is bedecked with copious baubles and fake snow, and comes complete with quotes from the movie on the mirror. Even the door to the suite is now Elf-themed, overlaid with a floor-to-ceiling picture of Buddy’s famous green costume.</p>
      <p>The package also comes with complimentary entrance to the the Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center – assuming, of course, you can navigate the revolving doors. Just remember to wear more than bright yellow tights when braving New York in December.</p>

      <p>“Every detail of this Elf-inspired suite was designed to put families in awe from the moment they walk in,” said Noah Brodsky, chief brand officer for Wyndham Destinations. “Club Wyndham wants to help our owners check that list off in a spectacular way.  We think there’s no better way to do it than to get families immersed into Buddy the Elf’s whimsical Christmas world.”</p>
