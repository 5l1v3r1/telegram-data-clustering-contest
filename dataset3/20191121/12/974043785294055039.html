      <h1>Drying off: A new udder health bolus to target individual high SCC cows</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Agriland Team</a></address>
      <p>An established method to tackle udder health challenges without antibiotics is been broadened to selectively target individual cows with high somatic cell counts (SCC) at the point off drying off.</p>
      <p>The Maycillin udder health bolus, developed by Mayo Healthcare, is engineered to release the active compound <b>allicin</b>, which is a sulfoxide amino acid of Alliin.</p>
      <p>Allicin in bolus form is used extensively in a growing number of countries in both clinical and sub-clinical challenges, but it is the first time this novel technology is being used to target cows for the drying-off period in Ireland.</p>
      <h3>Tackling udder health performance</h3>
      <p>Mayo Healthcare sales manager Leo Forkan says the bolus allows farmers to tackle udder health performance in an effective way without the use of antibiotics.</p>
      <p>We are now entering a post-antibiotic period in dairying. New products like the Maycillin bolus aids udder health and this bolus technology offers farms a new method of tackling high cell count cows without having to rely on antibiotics.</p>

      <p>The dry period offers an ideal time to select cows whose cell counts have risen over <b>200,000</b>.</p>
      <p>The advice is to double bolus these individual cows at the point of drying off, if using a teat sealant, then apply the bolus after the teat sealant has been infused.</p>
      <p>For cows between 200,000 and 500,000, the application of the bolus is once off. For cows between 500,000 and 1 million, the advice is to make the application at the point of drying off and reapply at the beginning of the subsequent lactation.</p>
