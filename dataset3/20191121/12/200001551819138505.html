      <h1>Chelsea player knows he will need to follow David Luiz example and ‘force’ exit for January move</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:47:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/tom-coast/" target="_blank">Tom Coast</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/?refresh_ce">Corriere dello Sport</a>, normally a prime candidate when it comes to answering the question of who is making boring stories exciting, are in the business of playing down rumours on Thursday.</p>
      <p>They’ve done it with the Moise Kean to AS Roma one, and next up is Olivier Giroud to Inter.</p>
      <p>It’s no secret the striker needs game time since he isn’t getting any at Chelsea under Frank Lampard, and with Antonio Conte wanting some reinforcements in January, the Frenchman is an ideal (and relatively cheap) target.</p>
      <p>However, despite Inter ‘enquiring thoroughly’ and ‘informing itself’, there’s a big Alexis Sánchez shaped problem in their squad they need to sort out first.</p>

      <p>Before making any big decision, the Serie A side want to see what the Chile international’s recovery timeline is like, and with him set to return in January, they’ll wait and see how he does first.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Giroud knows that ‘forcing’ the issue could help convince his club to let him go, as Corriere use David Luiz’s example this summer, who pushed his way out of Stamford Bridge to join Arsenal.</p>
