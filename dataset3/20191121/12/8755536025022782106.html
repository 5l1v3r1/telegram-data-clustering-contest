      <p>Caitlyn Jenner’s son Brody has revealed why he won’t be watching her on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>The transgender star is currently taking part in the popular ITV series, but she’s yet to receive any public support from her six children – including Kendall and Kylie Jenner.</p>
      <p>Brody was approached by paps in LA yesterday, and according to The Sun, he said he wouldn’t be watching the show because he “doesn’t know what it is”.</p>

      <p>Brody was then asked if he thought Caitlyn would be OK in the jungle, after she broke down in tears on the first night.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn’s youngest son simply replied: “I don’t know. I hope so.”</p>
      <p>Brody and Caitlyn haven’t had the best relationship over the years, and it’s believed The Hills star was hurt when Caitlyn snubbed his wedding to Kaitlynn Carter in 2018.</p>
