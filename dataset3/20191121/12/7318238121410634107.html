      <h1>European Commission candidates approved ahead of final vote</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:38:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:38</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Hurst</a></address>
      <p>The European Parliament is to vote on the new European Commissioners after the parliament's chief announced the debates and hearings on the makeup of the new Commission were complete.</p>
      <p>After meeting with the Commission’s three executive Vice Presidents-designate, David Sassoli told a press conference the College of Commissioners would be presented to the parliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>"If it's a favourable vote, the Commisison will be able to start its work on 1 December," he said.</p>
      <p>Prior to this announcement, the European Commission President-elect Von de Leyen had to select replacements for Hungary, Romania and France.</p>
      <p>Her previous picks for the three countries - France's Sylvie Goulard, Hungary's Laszlo Trocsanyi and Romania's Rovana Plumb - were rejected by MEPs in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>27 EU member states have made their nominations, but the United Kingdom failed to put names forward, leading to the European Commission to begin infringement proceedings against the UK.</p>
      <p>The European Commission gave the UK until Friday 22 November to respond.</p>
