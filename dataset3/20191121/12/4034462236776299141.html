      <h1>Aggressive Kia Seltos Concepts Ready For Adventures</h1>
      <h2>Say hello to the Kia Seltos X-Line Trail Attack and Urban Concepts.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:52:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:52</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>At the 2019 LA Auto Show, the covers came off the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/seltos">2021 Kia Seltos</a> SUV and the refreshed <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/niro-hybrid">2020 Kia Niro Hybrid</a>. These aren't the only new Kia models being showcased at the event, however, as the Korean automaker has also unveiled two new concepts based on the stylish Seltos. The Kia Seltos X-Line Trail Attack Concept and Kia Seltos X-Line Urban Concept offer unique takes on the stylish SUV with increased capability. Built by Zero to 60 Designs of Corona, California, the concepts are designed to convey the active lifestyles of Seltos owners.</p>
      <p>"The Seltos is an exciting addition Kia's tough and rugged lineup of Kia SUVs," said Michael Cole, president of Kia Motors America. "But the Kia brand is always looking toward the future and we are eager to show what may wait just around the corner. These new concepts are meant to get the creative juices flowing and illustrate what the ultimate Seltos could be."</p>

      <p>While the production Seltos is planned to go on sale in Q1 2020, Kia isn't planning to put either concept into production. Then again, Kia also said the same about the GT Concept and the Telluride Concept, which both spawned production models in the form of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/stinger">Kia Stinger</a> sport sedan and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/kia/telluride">Kia Telluride</a> SUV.</p>
      <p>The Kia Seltos X-Line Trail Attack Concept is designed for driving off the beaten track and features a custom two-tone paint scheme evoking a desert sunset and eight ultra-bright Hella auxiliary lights mounted on the front bumper and roof to improve visibility.</p>

      <p>Equipped with electronic AWD, the center differential lock equally distributes power between the front and rear axles, while a custom two-inch lift kit raises ground clearance to 9.2-inches. Off-road traction is improved thanks to rugged Knobby off-road tires with 17x8â€“inch custom-painted alloy wheels. There's also a hidden winch behind the front valance and a custom fabricated roof rack.</p>
      <p>Like the regular Seltos, power is provided by a 1.6-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 195 lb-ft of torque through a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. Inside, the Trail Attack Concept retains its Seltos sibling's production interior.</p>

      <p>As the name implies, the Seltos X-Line Urban Concept is designed for the challenges of city driving. Inspired by the glass and steel skyscrapers of New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, the Urban Concept is distinguished by a custom slate gray paint scheme with a contrasting gloss-black roof panel.</p>
      <p>A custom two-inch lift offers protection against potholes while also raising the seating position to offer a better vantage point around congested city track. Electronically controlled AWD with torque vectoring sends power to the 17-inch alloy wheels. A custom hood features an integrated intake, giving the Seltos a more aggressive appearance. Four roof-mounted auxiliary lights provide extra visibility through city fog and a custom fabricated roof rack offers extra storage. Inside, the interior has been left unchanged, retaining its production sibling's 10.25-inch touchscreen, a navigation system, and a backup camera and the powertrain is also identical.</p>
