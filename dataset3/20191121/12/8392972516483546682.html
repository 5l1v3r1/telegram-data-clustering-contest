      <p>Saturday, January 4, to be precise!</p>
      <p>Fan favourite Connie was last seen in August when she <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/amanda-mealing-casualty-bosses-resetting-connie-beauchamp/">left under a cloud of shame</a>.</p>
      <p>After a storyline that saw her struggle with an addiction to prescription drugs, Charlie Fairhead was forced to dismiss her from the ED.</p>

      </p>
      <p>She hasn't been seen since - apart from in a comical <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/children-in-need-viewers-slam-mel-giedroyc-for-spoiling-show-and-constant-interruptions/">Children in Need</a> sketch in which she strutted around the hospital like the Queen of Sheba and got the cast to ask viewers multiple medical questions.</p>
      <p>Actress Amanda Mealing, who plays Connie, directed the special video herself.</p>
      <p>When Connie returns in 2020, Amanda teased that "there are hints of romance to come" but also added that "it's not what anyone will think or expect".</p>

      <p>The 52-year-old previously revealed that Casualty bosses were "resetting" Connie after her exit.</p>
      <p>Giving viewers hope for the character's future, Amanda told <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/casualty/a28646150/casualty-amanda-mealing-connie-exit-return-details/">Digital Spy</a>: "We are resetting Connie, which is really exciting for me.</p>
      <p>"We've seen her vulnerable side, but I am now pushing to get back into that strong, strident Connie that viewers love.</p>
      <p>"I go back to work very soon, so she will be off screen for a while. But she will come back so much stronger.</p>
      <p>"When you hit rock bottom, there's no one else left but you. You have to look at yourself, and that's what she does. She has a chance to look at herself."</p>

      <p>Amanda - who originally appeared on sister show <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/drama-tv/holby-city/">Holby City</a> from 2004 to 2010 before joining the cast of Casualty four years later - received numerous tweets from fans delighted that her return date had been confirmed.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Is it January 4th yet? My queen is coming back!"</p>
      <p>Another said: "Cannot wait!!!! Cue the heels!"</p>
      <p>A third added: "Can't wait for Connie's return! I've missed the fabulous @meamandamealing on my screen."</p>
      <p>"Everyone is counting down the days for Christmas with such excitement," said one more. "It's like they have forgotten in the New Year Connie is back! Let's skip to 2020 #missingconnie #Casualty #skiptojanuary @meamandamealing."</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Amanda spoke openly about the anxiety she suffered following her breast cancer fight, saying it caused her to "crumble" and collapse at work.</p>
      <p>The star told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/">The Mirror</a> her PTSD left her drained - despite her determination to resume her acting career after a wearying health battle which saw her undergo a mastectomy, chemo and radiotherapy.</p>
      <p>Her cancer diagnosis came just one day after the birth of her second son.</p>
      <p>Speaking about her keeling over at the studios of Holby City, she admitted: "I literally crumbled down on my haunches at the steps, going up to reception. And there were only five steps and I couldn't make it up."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>She also acknowledged that she returned to her busy work commitments before dealing with how her cancer diagnosis and treatment had affected her.</p>
      <p>Amanda continued: "At the time I couldn't because I'd just had, what I call, my hand-to-hand combat of fighting the cancer, so I didn't have time to look at my emotional and psychological state."</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/casualty-star-amanda-mealing-opens-up-about-ptsd-collapse/">Amanda is convinced therapy has helped her cope</a> and manage her symptoms - describing the process as "essential".</p>
