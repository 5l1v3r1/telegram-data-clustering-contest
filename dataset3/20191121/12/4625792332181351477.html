      <h1>Pompeo seeks safe exit from state department ahead of Senate run: Report</h1>

      <p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is looking to resign from his post in the Trump administration so he can launch his senatorial campaign, but he's unsure of how to leave unscathed by President Trump.</p>
      <p>Pompeo, 55, originally planned on staying at the State Department until early spring, but that process might have been expedited, <i><a href="https://time.com/5732232/mike-pompeo-kansas-senate-run-state-exit/">Time</a></i> reported, citing three GOP sources. The sources included "one who served in the Trump Administration, another who remains in government, and a third who served in several high-ranking posts and is active in GOP politics."</p>
      <p>The impeachment investigation could speed up the Secretary's resignation given that the president and some of his loyalists blame him for the negative testimony of State Department officials. Pompeo, who previously served as CIA Director and as a member of the House, has also notably decided not to defend former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch or <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/we-all-can-get-it-wrong-mike-pompeo-suggests-william-taylor-misunderstood-ukraine-controversy">top diplomat William Taylor</a>.</p>
      <p>The Secretary of State has shot down rumors of a potential Senate run for months. Despite the state being solidly red, Pompeo stands to face a tough primary. Former Kansas political Kris Kobach, current Congressman Roger Marshall and others have already started their campaigns. There are a number of others who are said to be considering a run as well.</p>
