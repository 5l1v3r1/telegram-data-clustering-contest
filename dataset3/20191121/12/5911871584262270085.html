      <p>The long wait until the 1975’s new album <i>Notes On A Conditional Form</i> continues. The existence of the album was discussed all the way back around the release of last year’s excellent <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2023673/the-1975-a-brief-inquiry-into-online-relationships-review/franchises/premature-evaluation/"><i>A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships</i></a>, and then truly kicked into gear this August with the release of the batshit “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2055570/the-1975-people-video/video/">People</a>.” We’re still several months away, but the band recently returned with another, slightly more characteristic single called “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062164/the-1975-frail-state-of-mind/music/">Frail State Of Mind</a>.” (Both it and “People” ranked amongst our favorite songs in their <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2055837/the-5-best-songs-of-the-week-301/franchises/the-5-best-songs-of-the-week/">respective</a> <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2062694/the-5-best-songs-of-the-week-310/franchises/the-5-best-songs-of-the-week/">weeks</a>.)</p>
      <p>Given the very long lead-up to <i>Notes On A Conditional Form</i>, the 1975 have been sitting with this one for about a month now. The band recently brought “Frail State Of Mind” to a <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2065353/watch-the-1975-perform-frail-state-of-mind-on-colbert/video/">late-night performance on Colbert</a>. And today they’re back with a new video for the track.</p>
      <p>Just as “Frail State Of Mind” was a bit more recognizably 1975 than “People,” so too is its video a bit less jarring than the Marilyn Manson cosplay of its predecessor’s clip. The whole thing is Matty Healy alone in a room, surrounded by papers attached to the wall and filming himself for a giant projection on another wall. The whole vibe and aesthetic — especially when it gets to him dancing in silhouette against flashing imagery — is reminiscent of <i>Achtung Baby</i>/<i>Zooropa</i> era U2 with a bit more millennial anxiety injected into it, which seems like a fitting forebear for the 1975 in their current iteration. Check it out below.</p>
