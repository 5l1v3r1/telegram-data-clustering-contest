      <p>Jose Mourinho has reportedly contacted English striker Harry Kane telling him that he is the best forward in Europe and vowed to win trophies with him at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese recently <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277255-jose-mourinho-appointed-tottenham-hotspur-manager-10-months-losing-man-united-job.html">replaced Mauricio Pochettino</a> at Tottenham and he is preparing his squad for their coming Premier League game against West Ham United.</p>
      <p>Despite reaching the Champions League final last season, Tottenham have endured a shocking start to the ongoing Premier League season sitting 14th on the standings.</p>
      <p>And one of the big tasks given to Jose Mourinho is to ensure he convinces Harry Kane not to leave the club following the departure of Mauricio Pochettino.</p>

      <p>According to The Times, Jose Mourinho has began the process of making Harry Kane stay by sending him a text message that he wants to win trophies with him.</p>
      <p>
        <i>''I’ll be forever thankful to you for helping me achieve my dreams. ‘We’ve had some amazing moments in the last five and a half years that I will never forget.</i>
