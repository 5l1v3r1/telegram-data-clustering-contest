      <h2>Debbarma says illegal immigrants should be detected but doesn’t want them in jail, their rights scuttled or their deportation.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:23:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/debraj-deb/" target="_blank">Debraj Deb</a></address>
      <p>A day after Union Home Minister Amit Shah declared revision of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/">National Register of Citizens</a> across India, Tripura’s royal scion and former state Congress president Pradyot Kishore Debbarma has backed the idea but has a new formula to go about it. Debbarma says illegal immigrants should be detected but doesn’t want them in jail, their rights scuttled or their deportation.</p>
      <p>Debbarma had on October 22, 2018, filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking the revision of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/">NRC</a> in Tripura. The petition is said to have cost him his PCC presidentship.</p>
      <p>Pradyot claimed he was forced by All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary Luizinho Faleiro to retract his NRC petition and appoint former <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> leaders in key positions of Congress party — something that eventually led him to resign from his post.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>, Kishore said that NRC revision was required in Tripura but it didn’t necessarily need to “detect, delete, deport” people from the Indian territory.</p>
      <p>“The NRC formula in Assam is based on Assam Accord. My petition for NRC revision is based on the Constitution of India. They are two very different issues, I am hopeful that people don’t confuse the two,” Pradyot said.</p>
      <p>Asked how his petition seeks to revise NRC in Tripura and if the aftermath would look like Assam where 19 lakh people are excluded from the final list, Pradyot said, “Anyone born in India is an Indian. My petition relates to Article 6 of the Indian Constitution which specifies what qualifies one to be an Indian citizen. I have asked for detection. I said someone who came illegally in India can’t hold key Constitutional posts or government jobs. But they should be able to get education, live freely, practise their religion and other things.”</p>
      <p>Citing examples of Dalai Lama and Tibetan refugees living in India since last six decades, Pradyot said the country now needs a national refugee policy, which would allow rights to asylum seekers to live peacefully and not by violating the law.</p>
      <p>He also claimed many people in the incumbent BJP-IPFT administration, the erstwhile Left regime and the last Congress administration in 1988-93 were not Indian citizens and illegally held key Constitutional positions.</p>
      <p>About his political aspirations, Pradyot said he didn’t want to form any new party but would seek to bring all existing regional political parties of Tripura in a single platform but without merging them together.</p>
      <p>He said he would push for a Common Minimum Programme which would include upliftment of tribals in the state, NRC, opposition of Citizenship Amendment Bill, land alienation, recognition of Kokborok language in 8th Schedule, the tribal university in 6th schedule areas, larger seat representation for tribals in legislative assembly among others.</p>
