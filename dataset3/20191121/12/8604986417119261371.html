      <p>Apple is making a big fix to mitigate the chances of itsÂ <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/these-are-9-best-features-of-apples-new-ios-13.html">recreating the biggest mistake</a> the company has made all year.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead to 2020, Apple plans to revise how it evaluates software, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/apple-ios-14-features-changes-testing-after-ios-13-bugs">Bloomberg is reporting</a>, citing people who claim to have knowledge of its plans. The move will help Apple identify bugs (and ultimately address them) far more quickly than it did with iOS 13.</p>
      <p>In order to do that, Apple's new process will require that any features that are unfinished or sufficiently buggy will not be turned on in software updates. <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/the-9-best-ios-13-apps-for-iphone-11-iphone-11-pro.html">Apple's software developers</a> will then evaluate those bugs one at a time to see what they're doing and how they can be fixed before they become a widespread problem.</p>
      <p>Other companies, including Google and Microsoft, already use that technique to test for bugs before software is released. Apple hasn't followed their tack.</p>
      <p>It's fortunate for those of us who have <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/ios-13-is-here-but-department-of-defense-is-telling-people-not-to-upgrade-yet-should-you.html">suffered under the iOS 13 bug fiasco</a> that Apple is now looking to improve the process by which it releases its software.</p>
      <p>When Apple released iOS 13 in September, it was nearly universally criticized for bugs and odd glitches. Apps would crash or take forever to launch, and for whatever reason, Apple made changes to the autocorrect engine in its keyboard, causing plenty of mistypes. Just days after the operating system launched, Apple followed it up with a major update trying to fix some bugs and add in features that didn't make the cut in the first run.</p>
      <p>In just the two months since the operating system's release, iOS 13 has been updated a whopping eight times with bug fixes.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, it was an embarrassing moment for a company that prides itself on delivering a no-fuss solution to its users. It also served to prove that Apple, despite the accolades it receives from fans, has plenty of work to do to justify that lofty presence in people's minds.</p>
      <p>Now, according to Bloomberg's sources, the company is working with its developers to get a jumpstart on iOS 14 and try to get it right next year. But whether that means Apple will be spending more time on trying to find new features or just improve its software is unknown.</p>
      <p>Interestingly enough, it was rumored a couple of years ago that Apple was similarly concerned about iOS bugs in 2017 and used the iOS 12 it released in 2018 to focus more on fixing bugs than adding new features. This year's iOS 13 brought on many new features, like a dark mode and swiping keyboard.</p>
      <p>And now, it appears, that was a big mistake that Apple will once again need to address.</p>
