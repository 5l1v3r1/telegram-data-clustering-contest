      <h2>Fleetwood Town head coach Joey Barton is pleased the ‘nonsense’ is over, now that his side know they will be travelling to Goodison Park in the Leasing.Com Trophy.</h2>

      <p>There had been a bit of confusion on organising the fixture but the Cod Army will be facing Everton U21s, who came through a tough group, at Goodison Park.</p>
      <p>The game will take place next Tuesday, November 26 at 7:45pm.</p>
      <p>But the Fleetwood boss, who is an Everton fan, is looking forward to the contest and for the chance to manage a side at Goodison.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m looking forward to it.</p>
      <p>"It’s been moved to Tuesday now, there was a bit of nonsense about when it was being arranged but finally we have it in the diary now.</p>
      <p>"It comes as a part of a congested period of fixtures.</p>
      <p>"We’re delighted, we just want to bounce game to game now.</p>
      <p>"We’re really enjoying it. It’s a good challenge for us, a midweek game, going back to Goodison.</p>
      <p>"It’ll be nice. It’ll be the first time I’ve ever done that as a manager, albeit against an U21s side.</p>
      <p>"It would be nice to go there in the league on a consistent basis.”</p>
      <p>The Toffees youth side finished on six points and top of Northern Group E, winning one, drawing two and winning one of the resulting shoot outs for their draws.</p>
      <p>They also finished above three league sides, with Mansfield Town, Crewe Alexandra and Burton Albion all finishing behind Everton, in that order.</p>
      <p>Barton won’t be taking the tie lightly and is fully aware of what is at stake.</p>
      <p>“It’s a challenge we’ve got to overcome," he said.</p>
      <p>"I think some of my comments when I was working on the radio will no doubt add a little bit of fuel to the occasion.</p>
      <p>"I’m sure it’ll be nothing that we’ve not dealt with before and be something we’ll look forward to dealing with again.</p>
      <p>"We’ll pay them the ultimate respect by picking the strongest side we can, we want to go to Wembley and I’m sure they do.</p>
      <p>"We expect a really good cup tie. Hopefully we’ll get a good crowd there.”</p>
