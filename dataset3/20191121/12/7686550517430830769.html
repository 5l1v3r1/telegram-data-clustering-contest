      <p>A chance to stay in a room at Wembley Stadium overlooking the UEFA Euro 2020 final is up for grabs.</p>
      <p>The website <a href="https://fave.co/37rrIOf">Booking.com</a> is a partner of UEFA Euro 2020 and they are opening a sports suite for the occasion complete with a bed, football-inspired decor and seats right in front of the huge floor-to-ceiling windows directly overlooking the pitch.</p>

      <p>It will be open for a stay on Sunday, July 12 for the final of the tournament so you can catch all of the action, from the comfort of your room, the Mirror <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/uk-ireland/you-can-bag-stay-uefa-20923310">report.</a></p>
      <p>But first, the guests will take a VIP guided tour of Wembley Stadium followed by watching the UEFA EURO 2020 final from the suite’s balcony.</p>
      <p>Then, there will be a "luxurious" overnight stay as the pair wake up to a shower in the players’ changing rooms and have breakfast on the pitch.</p>

      <p>You'll be hosted by football legend David Villa for the entire match too.</p>
      <p>The Spanish footballer said: "Wembley is one of the most iconic venues in world football, for players and fans alike, so the chance to stay in the Stadium Suite the night of the Final and experience the electric atmosphere is truly a once in a lifetime opportunity!</p>
      <p>"I look forward to meeting the lucky winners on July 12 next year."</p>
