      <p>Paramedics, firefighters, police and members of the public gathered at Orchard Park Wednesday night to brave the cold for the eighth annual National Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims. </p>
      <p>The event was organized by lawyer Paul Hergott, who founded the non-profit organization <a href="https://www.onecrashistoomany.com/">One Crash Too Many</a> with wife Terri after a friend was killed in a collision. </p>
      <p>"Crashes and collisions are caused so regularly that we become desensitized to them,” says Hergott. "It’s only when our hearts are touched that we get anything of a grasp of how devastating they are… That’s why we have a day for remembrance. It is a time for reflection, a time for getting a grasp and feeling that loss, a time for supporting those who have lost loved ones and those living with life-changing injuries. A time for appreciating and supporting the emergency services personnel who deal with the aftermaths of horrific crashes on a daily basis.”</p>
      <p>Hergott says he is convinced that if drivers understood how to maintain constant attentiveness on the road and removed distractions – including handsfree devices – it would result in a dramatic reduction in crashes.</p>
      <p>"Science has established that we can be looking out of our windshield with our brain not processing up to 50% of what our eyes are looking at. If our brain is diverted elsewhere, our eyes see, but our brain fails to process a lot of it. That’s scientific evidence collected and put into the report produced by the B.C. government in 2009 – before they passed the idiotic law that banned handheld use and left hands free perfectly legal.</p>
      <p>"Show some leadership to those around you and your children. Leave your phone completely alone when driving. Avoid other activities that take your attention away from the task at hand and actively work to maintain constant attentiveness to the road, and don’t tolerate the dangerous driving behaviour of others."</p>
      <p>Kelowna Fire Department fire and life safety educator Rick Euper shared his experiences of dealing with the traumatic aftermath of crashes daily – most of them avoidable. </p>
      <p>The event was also attended by Hideki Mimura, a father who lost his 21-year-old daughter to a crash on Highway 5 in April 2017. The university student was travelling back to UBC Okanagan after a trip to Vancouver. </p>
      <p>It’s the third year Mimura has travelled from Japan to attend the event, and he says what he really wants to see is stronger repercussions for drivers who cause collisions.</p>
      <p>"Since the day Melissa died, all of our family are having a very hard time every day and grieving. This pain won’t go away, and this is going to continue for our lifetime. We should be regarded as victims, too. But instead, it’s like we have life sentences for no reason. But, the guilty driver was only asked to pay a $1,500 fine. That is so unfair.”</p>
      <p>Canada first declared the National Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims in 2008. </p>
