      <p>Having left their mark on the Marvel Cinematic Universe with <i>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</i>, <i>Captain America: Civil War</i>, <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> and <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, directors Joe and Anthony Russo are seemingly <a href="https://screenrant.com/russo-brothers-mcu-avengers-4/">done with Marvel Studios</a>. However, the former confirmed he and his brother would still be interested in taking a stab at fan-favorite Marvel character <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/moon-knight-tv/">Moon Knight</a> for his upcoming Disney+ series.</p>
      <p>"Moon Knight would be fun," Joe told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/61000-russo-brothers-interview-21-bridges-cherry-avengers-endgame">Inverse</a>. "It’s hard to say because we’re in the middle of <i>Cherry</i> right now. We’re on location in Cleveland shooting at the moment. But anything Marvel does is going to be special. And we’ve had such an amazing working relationship with them that I’m sure we’re all gonna find something to come back together."</p>

      <p>Moon Knight is one of three Marvel characters making their MCU debut in a Disney+ series, the other two being <a href="https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-disney-plus-new-series/">She-Hulk</a> and the current <a href="https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-series-disney-plus/">Ms. Marvel, Kamala Khan</a>. Afterward, they will head to the silver screen in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/she-hulk-moon-knight-ms-marvel-mcu-movies/">future Marvel films</a>, as opposed to previous Marvel shows that only referenced the films but never crossed over with them.</p>
      <p>Disney+'s <i>Moon Knight</i> series has yet to receive a release date.</p>
