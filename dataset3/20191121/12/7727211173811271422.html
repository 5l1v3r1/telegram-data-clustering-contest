      <h1>Unauthorised traveller encampments in Halton have plummeted since transit site opened</h1>
      <h2>Unauthorised encampments fell 95% between 2005 and this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:36:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/christopher-mckeon/" target="_blank">Christopher McKeon</a></address>
      <p>Unauthorised traveller encampments in Halton have fallen by 95% since the council established a transit site in the borough.</p>
      <p>In 2005, four years before the transit site in Warrington Road opened, Halton had 83 unauthorised encampments - more than one a week.</p>
      <p>This year, Dawn Taylor of the Cheshire Gypsy and Traveller Team told Halton councillors on Tuesday, that number has fallen to just four.</p>
      <p>Ms Taylor told the council’s Safer Policy and Performance Board that <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/halton-council">Halton</a> was “a shining example” for other local authorities in how to deal with unauthorised encampments.</p>
      <p>She said: “Most travellers already kind of know about it and to go and book in advance.</p>
      <p>“So obviously that helps with community cohesion because you don’t have the headlines in your local newspapers [about unauthorised encampments].”</p>
      <p>Halton has the only transit site for travellers in Cheshire, which as a county has had 176 unauthorised encampments this year.</p>
      <p>Committee chair Cllr Dave Thompson described setting up the transit site as “one of the most logical things we’ve done”.</p>
      <p>He said: “When the idea of a transit site came about, people were mortified.</p>
      <p>“They though ‘what the hell were the council doing?’</p>
      <p>“It’s turned out to be, as these statistics show, absolutely a sensible thing to do.”</p>
      <p>Ms Taylor said she hoped other local authorities in Cheshire and Merseyside would develop transit sites, but warned that a possible change in government policy could present problems for Halton if they didn’t.</p>
      <p>She said: “One of the issues is one of the proposals is the police can direct [travellers] to a transit site in a neighbouring local authority.</p>
      <p>“Police forces in Merseyside and Cheshire could direct travellers to your transit site.”</p>
      <p>With only 14 spaces on Halton’s transit site, she added, “that could be quite difficult”.</p>
