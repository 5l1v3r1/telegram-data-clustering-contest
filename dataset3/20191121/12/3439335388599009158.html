      <p>All nine satellite city hall locations are now accepting credit and debit cards, City and County of Honolulu officials announced today.</p>
      <p>The satellite city halls join the five driver licensing centers that already accept Visa, MasterCard and Discover as payment for city services, they said.</p>
      <p>The satellite city halls will accept credit card payments for motor vehicle transactions, bicycle and moped registration, bills, bus pass sales and dog licenses. A 2.35% service charge will apply, they said.</p>
      <p>“We continue to look for ways to help improve and modernize the experience of our customers,” Sheri Kajiwara, director of the city’s Department of Customer Services, said in a news release.</p>
      <p>Credit and debit cards are also accepted at the city’s <a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/02/12/breaking-news/vehicle-registrations-can-now-be-done-at-safeways/">self-service kiosks</a> that are available to residents 24/7 for renewing motor vehicle registrations. The six kiosks are available at select Safeway stores across Oahu. Locations and hours are available at <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/csd">honolulu.gov/csd</a>.</p>
