      <p>Cape Town - Portuguese tactician <b>Jose Mourinho</b> has wasted no time in appointing his new backroom staff and has vowed to lift <b>Tottenham Hotspur</b> up the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been named as Mauricio Pochettino's successor, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal at the north London club and has already named his backroom team.</p>
      <p>Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos have joined from Lille as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach, respectively.</p>
      <p>Carlos Lalin arrives as fitness coach, Ricardo Formosinho as tactical analyst and Giovanni Cerra as technical analyst. All three worked under Mourinho at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Mourinho met his new squad following his hasty appointment, which was announced less than 12 hours after Mauricio Pochettino was fired, on Wednesday and then took training ahead of his first game in charge at West Ham on Saturday.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese, who has been out of work since losing his job at United last December, inherits a squad that are languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League, having taken 14 points from their 12 games.</p>
      <p>They are 11 points off the top four and while Mourinho stopped short of saying Spurs could bridge that gap, he promised they would be in a better position once he gets going.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is certainly up for the challenge and says he is determined to ‘bring happiness to everyone that loves the club’.</p>
      <p>“In relation to the Premier League I think we know where we are and we know that we don’t belong there,” he told Spurs TV. “We should just play match after match. The next match we want to win and that is the same for the next and the next and the next until the last.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the season we will see where we are, but I know that we are going to be in a different position than we are now.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho will hold his first press conference with the assembled media at on Thursday afternoon.</p>
