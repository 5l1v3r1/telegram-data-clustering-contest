      <p>On 6 June this year, the couple announced they will be married which was a surprise to her fans and the entertainment circle.</p>
      <p>Lin wrote in her marriage announcement that some people said that love is a split-second gift and that she thinks it takes courage, tolerance, unselfishness, compromises and naivety to turn the split-second into a lifetime of company.</p>
      <p>She also described Akira as enthusiastic, hard-working, pleasant and kind. Lin’s father, Lin Fan-nan complimented his son-in-law for his tall stature and having a modest manner and good personality.</p>
      <p>To Akira, Lin Chi-ling is full of good things, saying during Sunday’s wedding that with the world’s population of several billion, being able to meet and marry her is due to fate.</p>
      <p>His words caused Lin to shed tears.</p>
