      <p>The Nigerian Senate has approved the request by President Muhammadu Buhari to increase Value-Added Tax (VAT) from 5 percent to 7.5 percent.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported that the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/10/15/vat-why-there-must-be-hike-buhari-govt-opens-up/">Federal Executive Council (FEC) in September approved an increase in VAT</a> and sent a bill to the National Assembly for consent.</p>
      <p>However, the Red chamber passed the Finance bill during Thursday’s plenary after it scaled through the third reading on the floor of the Senate.</p>
      <p>The Senate also approved the amendment of six tax provisions and make them more responsive to tax reform policies.</p>
      <p>It also seeks to amend the Customs and Excise Tariff Act to encourage local manufacturers.</p>
      <p>The legislation under the bill includes Companies Income Tax, Value Added Tax, Customs and Excise Tariff, Capital Gains Tax Act, Petroleum Profit Tax, Personal Income Tax, and Stamp Duties Act.</p>
      <p>The Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, and Senators Ifeanyi Ubah, Gabriel Suswan and Abba Moro, however, raised objections to the bill.</p>
      <p>According to the lawmakers, the increment in taxes would further compound the sufferings and pains of Nigerians.</p>
