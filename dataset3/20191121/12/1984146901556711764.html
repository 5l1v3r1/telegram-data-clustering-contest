      <h1>I'm A Celebrity favourite to win changes as bookies slash odds on Jacqueline Jossa</h1>
      <h2>Bookies have got a new frontrunner in the race to be I'm A Celebrity winner with odds changing all the time</h2>

      <p>We're still only days into the new series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here but bookies have already tipped two different stars to win the show this year.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> returned to our screens on Sunday night with this year's lineup including Caitlyn Jenner, Ian Wright and Nadine Coyle.</p>
      <p>So far we have seen <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn</a> in action quite a bit; in the first Bushtucker Trial alongside Kate Garraway and then in a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-celebrity-caitlyn-jenner-transition-17277364">candid chat about life with the Kardashians and her transition into a woman.</a></p>
      <p>Bookies thought the 70-year-old has made such a good impression on viewers, that they earmarked her as the new favourite to win.</p>
      <p>Original tip to win Ian Wright has now seen his odds drift as odds have also been slashed on Capital Radio host and son of Spandau Ballet and Eastenders legend Martin Kemp, Roman Kemp.</p>
      <p>And the new joint favourite to win is ex-Eastenders actress Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Jacqueline is proving to be one of the stars of this year’s I’m A Celebrity and William Hill now make her their 7/2 joint favourite alongside Roman Kemp. “You could not fail to have been impressed by Jacqueline’s performance in the spider trial and she is definitely a hit with viewers,” said William Hill spokesman Rupert Adams.</p>
