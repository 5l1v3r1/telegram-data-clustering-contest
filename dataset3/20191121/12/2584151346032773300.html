      <h1>MEPs call on UEFA to do more to kick racism out of football</h1>
      <h2>The letter follows several incidents of racism in European football in recent months.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:27:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author">Eline Schaart</a></address>
      <p>A group of 140 MEPs have <a href="https://twitter.com/samiraraf/status/1197210582623170561?s=20">written to European football's governing body</a> urging it to take "urgent action" against racism and discrimination in the wake of a recent incident during a match in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The lawmakers acknowledged the work that UEFA has done to remove racism and discrimination from the sport — including the so-called three-step procedure under which referees can halt a game if there is a racist incident inside a stadium and, if the behavior continues, abandon the match — but said more needs to be done.</p>
      <p>In the Netherlands on Sunday, the referee <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50457235">suspended a game</a> after fans of FC Den Bosch abused a black player from Excelsior Rotterdam. The player, Ahmad Mendes Moreira, was racially abused throughout the game.</p>
      <p>The Dutch public prosecutor is working with local police in order to determine what exactly happened and who participated in the abuse, while the national football association said it was exploring possible sanctions against the club and its supporters.</p>
      <p>It is the latest incident of racism in European football in recent months. In October, an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50212951">international match</a> between England and Bulgaria saw Bulgarian fans taunting England's black players with monkey chants and Nazi salutes.</p>
      <p>The MEPs called on UEFA to ensure that the three-step procedure is properly enforced, as well as to increase funding for anti-racism and discrimination education.</p>
      <p>The letter also asked football officials to move away from symbolic sanctions and to impose significant sanctions, including the potential expulsion of clubs and countries from tournaments.</p>
