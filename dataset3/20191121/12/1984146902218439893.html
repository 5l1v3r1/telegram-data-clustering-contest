      <p>Around 60 schools across the North East are reporting absences of staff and pupils following an outbreak of a flu-like virus.</p>
      <p>Experts from the Government run Public Health England North East (PHE NE) health protection team have confirmed they have been working with dozens of schools and local authorities in the region.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of children have been off sick this week in the North East with some schools being forced to close as a result of the high numbers of absentees of both staff and students.</p>
      <p>Three <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham</a> schools have resorted to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/north-east-schools-close-virus-17292201">closing for a deep clean</a> to help prevent the spread of infection.</p>

      <p>Burnopfield Primary School, Newton Hall Infants' School are both closed today (Thursday), while Durham Blue Coat C of E (Aided) Junior School opened its doors again on Thursday following a 48-hour clean up.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a third of children at the 450-pupil Holystone Primary School, in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside</a> , were off sick on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Dr Gayle Dolan, consultant in health protection for PHE NE, said: “Around 60 schools across the region are reporting absences due to symptoms of likely viral illness including influenza (flu) and norovirus.</p>
      <p>“We expect viral illnesses of this kind to circulate in schools and the community at this time of year and we have been providing advice to parents and schools to help reduce the spread of infection.</p>
      <p>“Flu can be extremely unpleasant for young children but for most healthy people it is a self-limiting illness. Some people including older people, those with long-term medical conditions or weakened immune systems can be more at risk of developing complications and should seek prompt medical assessment if they develop symptoms of flu."</p>
      <p>It comes after hundreds of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/st-mary-school-jarrow-closed-17262354">pupils were told to stay at home</a> after the winter bug hit St Mary's RC Voluntary Aided Primary School in Jarrow last week.</p>
      <p>The school was closed at the end of last week and a deep clean was carried out, with pupils and staff returning on Monday.</p>

      <p>Public Health England was also called to Kells Lane Primary School in Low Fell, Gateshead, following <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/health-officials-called-fever-vomiting-17251800">reports of a large number of sick children.</a></p>
      <p>And on Tuesday, Jarrow School and Jarrow Cross C of E Primary School <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/jarrow-school-closed-sickness-council-17279155">were shut</a> to allow a deep clean to take place.</p>
      <p>Public Health England further said there had been a delay in the delivery of some batches of the flu vaccine this year but this has not prevented children at high risk of flu from getting the vaccine.</p>
      <p>First, there was a two-week delay compared to last year as the World Health Organisation took longer to make a decision on the strain to include in the vaccine.</p>
      <p>However, the schools' programme started at the beginning of October.</p>
      <p>Following this, there was a "temporary pause" of around five days to schools ordering the childhood vaccine. This was on November 8 but re-opened on November 14.</p>
      <p>As a result, some schools have had to reschedule their flu vaccination sessions. The delay only related to some batches of Fluenz Tetra nasal spray.</p>
      <p>GPs have been advised to prioritise all those under 18 years of age who are in at-risk groups, followed by younger children aged two and three.</p>

      <p>Dr Dolan added: "The flu vaccination is the best form of protection we have. If they haven’t already had the flu nasal spray, it is important children who are in the clinical risk groups of flu visit their GP as soon as possible to be vaccinated.</p>
      <p>"Primary school children should take up the opportunity to be vaccinated when their school vaccination programme begins, and toddlers aged two and three should visit their GP surgery as normal to receive this.</p>
      <p>“We also encourage adults in risk groups for flu: including pregnant women, those aged 65 and over and people with long term medical conditions or weakened immune systems, to book in with their GP or local pharmacy to receive the free vaccine.</p>
      <p>“The risk of all infections can be reduced by practising good hand hygiene, particularly after using the toilet, after using a tissue to catch a cough or a sneeze, and before eating.</p>
      <p>“If you are concerned about your child’s symptoms, or need further advice on how to manage an illness please consult your GP or NHS 111 in the normal way.”</p>
