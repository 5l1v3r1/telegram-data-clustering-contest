      <h1>The Young Offenders deny involvement in Cork bike theft in hilarious tweet</h1>
      <h2>The two lads say they were not in the area at the time of the theft</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:07:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:07</time> by <a rel="author">Cormac O'Shea</a></address>
      <p>The Young Offenders have denied on their official Twitter account that they had any involvement in the disappearance of two bikes in Co <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cork">Cork</a>.</p>
      <p>Delinquents Jock and Conor are well-known for their bike stealing ways on the hit comedy series set in the Rebel County.</p>
      <p>And while the show isn't exactly based on true events, the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/the-young-offenders">Young Offenders</a> official Twitter account had a fun of blurring the line between reality and fiction.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.corkbeo.ie/culture/whats-on-news/young-offenders-hilariously-deny-involvement-17291714">CorkBeo</a>, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/blackrock">Blackrock</a> Village's Twitter account made an appeal earlier this week which read: "If anyone is missing two kids' bikes in the Blackrock/Mahon area, I passed these two at 8am this morning on the walkway just down from Blackrock Castle."</p>
      <p>Someone quickly replied: "Last seen being ridden by two lads named Conor and Jock."</p>

      <p>But keen to uphold their good name, the show's account replied: "We weren't anywhere near there, promise."</p>
      <p>Fans who have kept up to date with the new series, will know that the pair are still fond of robbing the odd bike.</p>
      <p>The opening scene of episode one shows them trying to take the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/gardai">garda</a> bikes from the Bridewell Garda Station.</p>
      <p>Season two of The Young Offenders continues on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rte">RTE</a> Two next Monday.</p>
