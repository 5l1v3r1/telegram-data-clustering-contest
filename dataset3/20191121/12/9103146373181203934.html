      <p><u>MARRIAGE</u>   <u>RELATIONSHIPS</u><br/><br/>KAMPALA - <b>We are making 11 years in marriage in February next year.  We are blessed with three children and a number of other blessings.</b><br/><br/>However, for almost half our marriage, my husband has been unemployed and I have been the breadwinner and of course with some help from his relatives.<br/><br/>With all those challenges, I expected my husband to value my hard work by being loving and faithful.<br/><br/>I also expected him to use that much free time to think of ways of generating an income for our family but no, he instead resorted to cheating.<br/><br/>I have caught him with love messages to about six different women at different times. I’m not sure how far he has reached with any of them but I’m sure that there are many more women that I don’t know about.<br/><br/>This year alone, I have caught him twice, in May and November with love messages to two different women.  I feel so betrayed because we are struggling so much financially that we even moved our children from good schools to an affordable one around the village.<br/><br/>I also expected him to value my hard work and the plans we talk about to get out of poverty but it seems we are at a different wavelength. <br/><br/>I’m contemplating divorce to take it on single-handedly like many single mothers rather than being a single mother in marriage, moreover with someone who doesn’t value me.<br/><br/>Alternatively, I feel like, in fact, I’ve started looking for someone to flirt or cheat with, just to give him a taste of his own medicine.<br/><br/>I’m so tired and annoyed, what should I do?<br/><br/><i><b>Harriet </b></i><br/> </p>
