      <p>Nicolás Gaitán could be on his way to the Premier League in January, with West Ham, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/aston-villa">Aston Villa</a> and Sheffield United interested in signing the former Argentina winger on a two-year deal.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old is available on a free transfer with his contract at MLS side Chicago Fire due to expire at the end of December. Gaitán, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/04/nicolas-gaitan-manchester-united-benfica">perennially linked</a> with a move to Manchester United during his spell at Benfica, has an option to remain in the United States for another year but is understood to favour a return to Europe. He spent the previous season at Chinese side Dalian Yifang.</p>
      <p>His return of four goals and 11 assists in 27 MLS appearances has alerted West Ham, with initial talks understood to have taken place between the sporting director, Mario Husillos, and the player’s representative, Matias Lipman, over a January move.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini’s side are struggling in the lower half of the table as they prepare to face Tottenham on Saturday in José Mourinho’s first match since taking over from Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Resolving West Ham’s defensive issues is the priority for the transfer window, although the manager is believed to have requested more attacking reinforcements as well.</p>
      <p>West Ham are expected to face competition from Villa for Gaitán’s signature, while Chris Wilder’s United have also registered an interest. The former Atlético Madrid player has won 16 caps for Argentina but has not made an international appearance since 2016.</p>
