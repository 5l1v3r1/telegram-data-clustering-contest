      <p>This slow-cooked meatball and pea strew recipe is pretty special. Serve with deliciously creamy mashed potatoes. My top tip: blanching the peas first helps to prevent them from going hard.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>45 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>100g smoked lardons or large chunks of pancetta</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
        <li>200g peas</li>
        <li>400g pork mince, straight out of the fridge</li>
        <li>30g fresh breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>Zest of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>A handful of parsley leaves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>A pinch of dried chilli</li>
        <li>1 tsp fennel seeds, roughly crushed</li>
        <li>30g Parmesan, plus extra to serve</li>
        <li>275ml dry sherry</li>
        <li>Mashed potato, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Add a good splash of oil to a deep pan and place over a medium heat. When hot, add the lardons or pancetta and fry until they begin to release their fat.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and the garlic and cook slowly for at least 8 minutes until soft and sweet.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a pan of hot water to the boil and blanch the peas for 2 minutes. Drain, keeping the cooking liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked peas to the onions and pour over enough cooking water to come halfway up the peas. Turn the heat down to a simmer and cover while you make the meatballs.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining ingredients, except the sherry, in a large bowl and season well. Mix with your hands, then shape into ping-pong-sized balls.</li>
        <li>Add a good splash of oil to a large frying pan and place over a medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs until golden all over and then add to the peas.</li>
        <li>Pour over the sherry and bring to the boil. Turn down to a simmer and cover with greaseproof paper. Leave to simmer for 10-15 minutes until the meatballs are cooked through and the peas are soft and delicious. Serve with mashed potato.</li>
