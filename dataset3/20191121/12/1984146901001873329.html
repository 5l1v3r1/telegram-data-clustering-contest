      <p>We're still less than a week into the new series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here but the camp already has two new arrivals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> returned to ITV on Sunday night with a lineup including Ian Wright, Caitlyn Jenner and Nadine Coyle heading into the jungle.</p>
      <p>So far we've had talk about the Kardashians, a rendition of Girls Aloud hit The Promise, a stomach-churning Bushtucker Trial and even a spat over Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>And there are sure to be laughs aplenty with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-late-arrivals-17275271">the arrival of two new campmates,</a> who have one big thing in common - they are both soap legends.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night's episode of I'm A Celebrity, we'll get our first look at Coronation Street actor Andrew Whyment, better known as Wetherfield's Kirk Sutherland, and see fellow new arrival Cliff Parisi in action too.</p>
      <h3>Who is Cliff Parisi?</h3>
      <p>Cliff is better known to millions of viewers as as ex-Eastenders regular Minty.</p>
      <p>Cliff went on to appear in BBC drama Call The Midwife and show bosses think the 59-year-old and Andy will be just the tonic for this year's series.</p>
      <p>Revealing what he'll struggle with most in the jungle, Cliff said "When you have a crucial time in your life, you always have a cup of tea. To go without tea, no telly and not much food will be tough. It’s going to be hard being away from my creature comforts.”</p>
      <p>As for what his colleagues on Call the Midwife will think when they find out he is swapping the popular drama for snakes and rats and he says: “They will be screaming with delight once they find out. I know they won’t be disappointed and they will be rooting for me.</p>
      <p>"In fact, I know they will be phoning up for me to do the trials! Doing I’m A Celebrity is going to be so much fun. It is going to be the best year!”</p>
