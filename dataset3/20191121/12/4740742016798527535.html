      <h1>Make sure that men’s health matters this Movember</h1>
      <h2>The annual Movember campaign encourages men to think more about issues affecting their health, and Nuffield Health Bristol Hospital can help</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:02:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Jonny Dillon</a></address>
      <p>The month of ‘Movember’ is well under way, which over the course of the last few years has helped shine a spotlight on issues affecting men’s health each November. Men have a poor reputation when it comes to looking after their own health, and on average, men will go to see their GP half as often as women. </p>
      <p>However, British men are paying the price for neglecting their health, as more than 100,000 men die prematurely every year. Therefore, it’s important for men to be aware of changes in their health, and to see their GP immediately if they notice something that’s not right. </p>
      <p>To mark this year’s Movember campaign and promote awareness of men’s health issues, we spoke to Consultant Urologist Professor Raj Persad, from Nuffield Health Bristol Hospital, who is always keen to promote the awareness of men’s health issues and the treatments available.</p>
      <p><b>Professor Persad, what made you decide to specialise in urology and men’s health?</b>  </p>
      <p>I wanted to practice medicine on the cutting edge of developments, and at the time, urology seemed to have that - modern technologies like laser and lithotripsy, and new cancer treatments for prostate and other insights. </p>
      <p>Developments over the years have vindicated my choice and now I do a lot of robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery and use new technologies like REZUM (intraprostatic high pressure steam) treatment for prostate enlargement, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), to give it its medical name. </p>
      <p>There also seemed to be a high patient satisfaction rate following treatment, which there isn’t in all specialities. </p>

      <p><b>What’s the most important quality for a consultant urologist?</b>  </p>
      <p>Most important is to listen and understand the patient, putting their worries and concerns at the focus of the discussion, and working to his priorities. Urologists work in many areas where more than one treatment choice exists, and without listening, you can’t properly tailor the treatment to the needs of the patient, incorporating all the various options available. </p>
      <p><b>What do you enjoy most about being a consultant urologist?</b>  </p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, the satisfaction in making people better makes the job worthwhile. Also, offering the best continuum of care you can is most important to me. For example, some treatments involve a combination of skilled surgery and skilled radiotherapy to achieve the best results.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What advice or reassurance would you give to someone who is considering coming to see you, but who might be nervous or embarrassed about their problem? </b>
      </p>
      <p>The reassurance I would give is that, however strong the fear or embarrassment might feel, we can always help to improve things - either by cure or by reassurance. So much of medicine is about reassurance, explaining problems (and how they should be addressed) in lay language. Doctors are not always good at this! </p>
      <p><b>If you weren’t a doctor, what would you like to do instead?</b>  </p>
      <p>Be George Clooney, in ER! No, seriously, I don’t know what else I would have wanted to be. I have always wanted to be a surgeon! </p>
