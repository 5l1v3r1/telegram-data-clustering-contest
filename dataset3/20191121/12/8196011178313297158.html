      <p>Transport Minister Shane Ross is to seek a meeting with his British counterpart over the "peculiar" ownership structure of Rosslare Port as soon as new Government is formed in Britain.</p>
      <p>Mr Ross has come under fire for failing to bring Rosslare harbour — which is owned by a British company set up under UK statute — under full control of the State.</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil's Mary Butler raised the complex ownership issue in the Dáil and warned that is "wrong-headed to leave it in control of a foreign nation" given the threat which Brexit now poses.</p>
      <p>The port was established under the Rosslare Fishguard Harbours Company 1898 by UK statutory instrument. This arrangement covers the two ports and part of the railway at either side.</p>
      <p>Under this act, the British government delegated control of Rosslare to Iarnród Eireann and Fishguard in Wales comes under the control of Stena Line.</p>
      <p>Pressed on the issue in the Dáil, Mr Ross said he would be "happy" to get his officials to look at the ownership of the port with a view to legislation being introduced here and in Britain.</p>
      <p>He agreed that the ownership structure is "peculiar" and "archaic" but claimed that it doesn't seem to be impacting on the working of the port.</p>
      <p>But Ms Butler said: "Unfortunately with Brexit looming the uncertainty around the future of the port has to be questioned."</p>
