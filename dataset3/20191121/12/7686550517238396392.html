      <h1>Is Secret Santa more trouble than it's worth?</h1>
      <h2>Nobody wants to be shown up in what is meant to be a bit of festive fun</h2>

      <p>It's not quite the Most Wonderful Time of the Year (TM) but we're getting there and plans are being put in place for the festive season.</p>
      <p>For workplaces that means figuring out where to go for the office Christmas party and roping as many people as possible into Secret Santa.</p>
      <p>It's a nice little tradition where everyone buys a gift for one other person but (theoretically) nobody knows who bought what.</p>
      <h3>The Claim</h3>
      <p>Millennials get accused of "killing" a lot of things and apparently Secret Santa is the latest practice on the list.</p>
      <p>Psychology lecturer Dr Ashley Weinberg of the University of Salford has said <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/secret-santa-christmas-millennials-anxiety-spending-limit-psychologist-ashley-weinberg-a9206176.html">some younger people in the workplace see Secret Santa as a source of anxiety</a> rather than festive joy, with a fear of being seen as "stingy" if their gift doesn't measure up.</p>
      <p>A hallmark of Secret Santa is strict spending limits placed on gifts so nobody shows anyone else up, but people don't always follow the rules and many younger workers don't have the same level of disposable income to splash out on gifts on that special someone whose name they picked out of a hat.</p>
      <p>A survey for Jobsite found that more than a quarter of young people in the workplace have needed to go into their savings or take out an overdraft to keep up with the gift giving of more affluent colleagues or peers.</p>
      <p>Dr Weinberg said people were open to "the whole range of human emotions" when they give a gift and their colleagues judge what they bought, which opens the door to humiliation.</p>
      <p>Nobody wants to be shown up in what is meant to be a bit of festive fun. It's supposed to be a secret but it's often difficult to bring the gift into the office and get it into the hands of the intended recipient without a few people noticing.</p>
      <h3>The Counter Claim</h3>
      <p>Don't worry, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/11/18/fear-not-millennials-solved-secret-santa-dilemma/">millennials haven't actually killed the jolly fat man in the red hat.</a> Most are fine with Secret Santa and the whole thing works best when everyone sticks to clearly defined rules.</p>
      <p>The golden rule is a price limit everyone can afford, meaning nobody is shown up when it comes time for presents to be unwrapped. £5 is usually enough, if you really must push the boat out then £10 is alright if everyone agrees to it.</p>
      <p>It might also be helpful to avoid overthinking your gift. Much of what is gifted during Secret Santa is probably destined to gather dust so keeping it simple with something edible and sweet is usually a good way to go.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, Secret Santa is supposed to be a bit of harmless fun and that's exactly what it can be as long as everyone keeps it simple. Without trying to sound too much like a teacher, the rules are there for everyone's enjoyment.</p>
      <h3>The Facts</h3>
      <p>Around six out of 10 workers in the UK think Secret Santa is a good idea for boosting morale and building a good rapport between colleagues. Most Brits think giving a gift to coworkers is a chance to show them respect and appreciation.</p>
      <p>Making sure the rules of Secret Santa are clear and everyone follows them are the keys to making the whole thing a success. Nobody gets priced out and no one is left embarrassed when that guy (you know the one) decides to show off.</p>
      <p>Sticking to the price limit is important and <a href="https://www.reed.co.uk/career-advice/secret-santa-dos-and-donts/">employment agency Reed recommends not going too far below it either,</a> because getting nowhere near a low price limit really is quite stingy.</p>
      <p>They also point out you should keep your gifts appropriate. Ideally you want to be receiving Christmas cards during the festive period, not letters from HR asking you to come in for a discussion about a "recent incident".</p>
