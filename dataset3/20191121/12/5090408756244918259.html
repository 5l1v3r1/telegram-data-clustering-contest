      <p>Walmart reportedly has plans to double its store count in China, opening 500 new stores in the next five to seven years.</p>
      <p>The news was first reported by Chinese newspaper, <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201911/21/WS5dd63458a310cf3e35579098_1.html">China Daily</a>, followed up with additional details by <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_term=link&amp;amp;utm_source=twbusiness&amp;amp;utm_content=2019-11-21T11%3A41%3A58">CNN</a>. A spokesperson for Walmart was not immediately available to comment when contacted by Business Insider.</p>
      <p>According to China Daily, the new locations will include a mix of smaller stores and supercenters as well as warehouses to fulfill online orders.</p>

      <p>Walmart first opened its doors in China in 1996 and has since grown to have 433 stores there. These largely belong to its namesake chain but there are more than two dozen Sam’s Club locations as well.
