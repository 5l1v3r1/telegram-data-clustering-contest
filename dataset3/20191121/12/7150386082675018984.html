      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar on Thursday urged India Inc to assess and review the impact of their CSR initiatives.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the ‘CSR Impact Conclave’ here, Kumar also said that companies should focus on nutrition and innovation as part of their CSR mandate.</p>
      <p>“India has excellent examples of CSR. Going forward, the corporate CSR should focus more on two additional areas like nutrition and innovation as a part of their CSR mandate,” he said.</p>
      <p>Kumar further said: “I think corporate must find a way to do well by doing good. ‘Doing good’ must be integrated in business practices in line with conscious capitalism by making self-interest a very small part of our way of doing business.”</p>
      <p>The gap between the social good and the corporate good should be studied, he added.</p>
      <p>He also urged the National CSR Network to work with the Niti Aayog for an objective impact assessment of the five years of the CSR initiative.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, the Additional Secretary for Department of Personnel and Training, Srinivas Katikithala said that there is a need for partnership between the government and industry for capacity building to achieve greater impact of CSR projects.</p>
