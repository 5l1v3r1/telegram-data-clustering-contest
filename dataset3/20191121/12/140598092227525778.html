      <p>This healthy mushroom and chickpea stew is vegan, gluten-free and packed with vegetables. Serve it with quinoa or rice, or any grain you fancy.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>1 hour</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Six</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>8 carrots</li>
        <li>850g mushrooms</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>4 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>4 tsp cumin power</li>
        <li>3 tsp ground chilli</li>
        <li>olive oil, for frying</li>
        <li>3 x 400g tins chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>7 tbsp tomato puree</li>
        <li>600ml boiling water</li>
        <li>2 x 400g tins chickpeas</li>
        <li>a big handful of coriander, about 50g, plus more to serve</li>
        <li>2 lemons, plus 3 more to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Start by peeling the carrots, then chop them into pieces. Cut the mushrooms into thin slices.</li>
        <li>Place the crushed garlic, turmeric, cumin, chilli, and some salt and pepper into a large saucepan along with 4 tbsp of olive oil. Allow this to heat until it’s bubbling, then pour in the tins of tomatoes, tomato puree and boiling water.</li>
        <li>Then stir in the chopped carrots and mushrooms. Bring this mix to the boil then turn it down to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Let this cook for about 30 minutes, then stir in the chickpeas (drain the tin first) and the finely chopped coriander.</li>
        <li>Let this cook for another 20 minutes, at which point the mushrooms and carrots should be soft and ready to eat. If you’re making quinoa to serve with it then cook this when you put the chickpeas in</li>
        <li>Once everything is ready squeeze the two lemons into the mix and place the stew into bowls with the quinoa. I like serving each bowl with half a lemon and an extra sprinkling of coriander.</li>
      </ol>
