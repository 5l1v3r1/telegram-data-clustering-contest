      <h1>Chelsea's Izzy Brown opens up on his injury struggles, Jose Mourinho's promise and life at Luton</h1>
      <h2>In the first of a two-part interview the attacker, who is on loan in the Championship, details how he lost confidence after tearing his cruciate ligament and why those who say he is big time are way off the mark</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alan Smith</a></address>
      <p>By Izzy Brown’s own frank admission, he remains inconsistent. The Chelsea attacker, on loan at Luton Town, is still searching for his best form following the torn cruciate ligament he sustained while at Brighton in January 2018 - but at least the self-doubt is beginning to fade.</p>
      <p>The past 22 months have been largely a struggle for the 22-year-old and there were moments during the arduous rehabilitation post-knee surgery in which he began to question his ability to return to full strength.</p>
      <p>Now, as the creator-in-chief for a Luton team battling to stay in the Championship, he is finding his confidence again despite being his own harshest critic. “One day I will be playing well and then the day after I have a dip, so right now I need to find that consistency,” he says.</p>
      <p>Yet the progress is clear. Earlier this month Brown played three games in a week for the first time since the injury. Although he ended up with a minor hamstring issue that meant he missed the Hatters’ defeat away to Reading, it cleared up quickly and he will be ready to face Leeds United, where he spent last season unhappy on loan, this Saturday.</p>
      <p>“When you’re injured you do really doubt yourself,” he says. “You think, ‘Will I get back to being as good or better than I was before?’ It kept playing on my mind because people say you lose 10% once you do your ACL and you lose your speed and awareness and I was thinking, ‘No I don’t want that to happen to me’.</p>
      <p>“This season I am starting to gain confidence, getting assists and playing well and that’s what I want to do. I need to add goals to my game, other than that the confidence is back.”</p>
      <p>Brown does not turn 23 until January but he has experienced enough to speak with an authority that belies his age.</p>
      <p>He is the Premier League’s third-youngest debutant after all, the player who Jose Mourinho promised to make a senior England international. He was also the underage talent West Bromwich Albion were so upset to lose that then chairman Jeremy Peace threatened to downgrade their academy.</p>
      <p>Although he played only 11 minutes of Chelsea’s Premier League title win in 2014-15, Mourinho demanded he get a medal because of his contribution to the squad and on the training pitch.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t get one, no,” Brown tells <b>football.london</b>, but he can remember and appreciate the gesture along with Mourinho’s proclamation on the 2014 pre-season tour that the Portuguese would have failed in his role if the then teenage attacking midfielder did not end up playing for England's senior team.</p>
      <p>“Me and Dominic Solanke were in the room together on pre-season tour. He was like, ‘Izzy, did you see what Jose said?’” Brown recalls. “We never took much notice, but we appreciated that one of the best managers in the world said that about us.</p>
      <p>“We were young and all we cared about was first-team football around that time. Being around the first-team was enough of an accomplishment for us. It was amazing that he said it but we didn't take it to heart too much.”</p>

      <p>Since then there have been successful loans at Vitesse, Huddersfield and Rotherham, the aborted spell at Brighton and, last season, a less enjoyable period on the periphery at Leeds.</p>
      <p>Now there is Luton, a club where he feels at home and is beginning to re-establish his best form despite a tricky start in which he felt like games were passing him by because of rustiness.</p>
      <p>“I just felt like I wasn't used to the pace,” he says. “Training is all right but until you start a Championship game you don't feel the pressure.</p>
      <p>“For me to not be able to do things straight away was difficult. I was trying things that weren't coming off and I was like, 'What's going on?' But now I feel like my confidence is coming back, my sharpness is coming back and I'm just trying things. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. But I keep trying.”</p>
      <p>He has five assists so far and Luton manager Graeme Jones has been regularly singing his praises, extolling his Premier League qualities. Brown says those comments have given him “so much confidence”, although scoring a first goal will relieve some further stress.</p>
      <p>“I feel like I need to prove it,” he adds. “Some people may not agree with him. I am just going to go out there and give it 100%. If I give 100% to the team then I know the boys behind me will give 100% as well. If we play to 100% then I don't think teams can beat us.”</p>
      <p>The quest to find the net is being helped by Tore Andre Flo, the former Chelsea striker who is a technical coach for the club’s loan players. The Norwegian has been to Kenilworth Road for several games and is paying regular visits to the training ground, while they also speak regularly on the phone.</p>
      <p>There are constant appraisals but also no shortage of advice from a former player Brown evidently admires.</p>
      <p>“I feel like I need to just get in the box more,” he adds. “Sometimes I am just waiting on the edge of the box for a cutback when I could be running into the box. Instead of waiting for the ball to come to me I should just go and attack the ball.</p>
      <p>“My friends came to watch me the other day and they said, 'Izzy, why do you always pass when you are in front of goal? You never shoot.' I was like, ‘I don't know.’ Sometimes I am too unselfish, sometimes I need to be more selfish and shoot but other than that I just want to score.”</p>
      <p>It is an odd quirk for a player who looks so confident in all other facets of the game. Is he afraid of team-mates having a go at him if he balloons a shot into the stands?</p>
      <p>“No,” he says. “I feel like I'm... I don't know, I don't want to say I'm arrogant but on the pitch I do think, 'You can't tackle me.' I have that in my mind before a game. 'I'm going to run over you in this game. No one is going to get close to me.'</p>

      <p>“If you go into a game with that mentality you're already a step ahead of them because the first time you get the ball you're already confident.</p>
      <p>“If they're thinking, 'I'm up against Izzy' or something like that, then I am already mentally a step ahead of them, if that makes sense. I won't say I'm arrogant, I'm just confident in my ability. Whoever I'm playing against, the holding midfielder, I think 'if it's me against you I'm going to beat you'. That's the confidence I have going into the game.”</p>
      <p>A misguided perception has also formed of Brown being flash, comfortably immersed in the luxuries of being a Chelsea player without actually being a Chelsea player. In reality he seems well grounded - his mum is always quick to point out mistakes, and he will watch misplaced passes instead of good moments from games.</p>
      <p>He believes getting out of the Cobham bubble and experiencing the “real world” in the Championship has been vital to his development, helping him understand what football is really about.</p>
      <p>“I feel like a lot of people have a perception of me that I am big time,” he says. “I am not big time when you get to know me. I am confident and I like cars. It is just a hobby but I don't do it to show off. People have their perception. When they really meet me then they know.</p>
      <p>“It is probably because I am from Chelsea. People think when you are from Chelsea you get everything. It is true that when you are growing up at Chelsea you get everything given to you. It is not the real world. When you step out in the real world is when you go out on loan. Then you really understand what football is like.</p>
      <p>“I think at Chelsea they sugar coat it when you are young. That's why loans are so important because you can man up. When you come in the dressing room, there's no one there for you. They are grown men and they will tell you when you are not doing good enough.</p>
      <p>“It was nice to get away [on loan] and I did it young. It was a good decision at the time to do it young. It wasn't too much for me because I wasn't at Chelsea growing up. I was at West Brom and I went to Chelsea at 16.</p>
      <p>“I wasn't really in the bubble after being at West Brom but then you see other players in that bubble and you think they don't understand. They don't have to clean player's boots and it is just because it is a massive football club. There's two different buildings but I feel like real football is Championship football.”</p>
      <p>He is also not taking being a Championship footballer for granted. The brutal nature of his rehab cannot be overstated and each appearance is genuinely cherished.</p>
      <p>The mood swings, the effects of the strong painkillers post-surgery and the common feeling of helplessness felt by footballers unable to do their job meant that Brown was often difficult to be around.</p>
      <p>There were moments during the long and painful rehabilitation when his partner, Destiny, had to help him shower. She was also there to help him up the stairs and, despite being heavily pregnant with their daughter, she would often get on the ground and do the exercises Brown’s physiotherapists had prescribed.</p>
      <p>“I don't know how she put up with me,” he says. ”The mood swings I was having when on the heavy tablets after the operation - I was like a ghost. I didn't know what I was saying.</p>
      <p>“She's done so much and now I feel like I owe a lot to her. Without her I don't know where I would be. I could still be injured, have a pain in my knee.”</p>
      <p>Now he goes to games and he sees his young daughter waving to him from the stands and, cliched as it sounds, fatherhood has given him a whole new perspective</p>
      <p>“It gives you so much confidence that a part of you is here watching,” he adds. “You just want to make them proud on the pitch. When I go out on the pitch I just want to play, make my family and friends happy. My daughter's everything to me.”</p>
