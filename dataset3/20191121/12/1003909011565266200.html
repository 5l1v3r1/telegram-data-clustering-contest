      <p>Jane Cooke who plays Donna in Stage West’s Mamma Mia! has done her share of musicals, including West Side Story and Beauty and the Beast, but it is the ABBA jukebox musical that holds a special place in her heart.</p>
      <p>Cooke, who is married to actor Vince Corazza, has played Donna in Las Vegas, on the Broadway national tour and in Regina and is now recreating the role in Calgary.</p>
      <p>Cooke and Corazza were living in Los Angeles working in film when she saw an open call for a Las Vegas production of Mamma Mia!</p>
      <p>“Even though I do film and voice over work my absolute first love is theatre, but I didn’t have a theatrical agent at that time so I had to do it all on my own,” says Cooke.</p>
      <p>She was hired for the Las Vegas company for two years where she ended up playing not only Donna, but her two longtime friends Rosie and Tanya.</p>
      <p>“I love all three of these characters, but what I love even more is their friendship that has lasted for at least 30 years.</p>
      <p>“They’re like sisters and it’s rare we get to see this kind of supportive, loving relationship between women in a musical. I am the youngest of four sisters, so I know what a beautiful thing this kind of friendship can be, and it has been captured in Mamma Mia! The female bond means so much to me.”</p>
      <p>After she completed her contract in Vegas, Cooke was asked to play Donna in a national Broadway touring company.</p>
      <p>“My husband and I had been living in two cities for two years. I didn’t want to be away from him on a tour so he agreed to audition for the touring production. They loved him and he ended up playing Harry, one of the three men who could be Donna’s daughter’s father.</p>
      <p>“We spent 18 wonderful months touring the U.S. together. We did all the touristy things in the cities where we played. We amassed such a great journal of memories, which is one of the reasons Mamma Mia! holds such a special place in my heart.”</p>
      <p>Cooke loves playing Donna because the character “is such a strong, vibrant, independent woman. She created a life for herself and her daughter all on her own. I also admire her joy for life and her love of family which are two things I definitely share with her. I come from a very close family.”</p>
      <p>It was family that prompted Cooke to accept an offer last year to star as Donna at the Globe Theatre in Regina.</p>
      <p>“I hadn’t been back to Canada in 16 years. My mother is 81 years old, so this was a way for her to see me in the role I love. My whole family came to Regina to see the show,” says Cooke adding La Danse, the studio where she trained as a youngster booked buses and brought 400 students to see the show.</p>
      <p>The Globe Theatre production was staged in the round and very intimate. For Cooke, the configuration at Stage West feels similar.</p>
      <p>“At Stage West the audience is literally at our feet, which means we get to see and feel their reactions instantly. Other than the Globe, I’m used to playing in large venues. It’s a very different experience and an exciting one.”</p>
      <p>Stage West’s Mamma Mia! is directed by Toronto-based choreographer, director and actor Phil Nero, who directed Stage West’s version of Young Frankenstein.</p>
      <p>“What’s so rewarding for the cast of our Mamma Mia! is that Phil has focused on the heart of the story by pushing the connections between mother and daughter and between the trio of longtime female friends.</p>
      <p>“This makes the show more rewarding for the audience as well as the actors.</p>
      <p>“It really is rare for four women to be the stars of a big Broadway musical and for three of those women to be played by mature actresses.”</p>
      <p>Stage West’s Mamma Mia! runs until Feb. 9 but some performances are already at capacity so it is advisable to book early especially for the holiday season.</p>
