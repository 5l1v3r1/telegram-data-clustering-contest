      <h1>Savage Scots teen jailed for biting lump out of pal's face in row over man at nightclub</h1>
      <h2>Danielle Gaffar left victim Kyra Strachan with horror injuries after the brutal attack.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:12:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Bugler</a></address>
      <p>A teenage girl who sank her teeth into the face of a former friend after a "disagreement" with the other girl, was jailed for 16 months today.</p>
      <p>Danielle Gaffar and her victim Kyra Strachan, who was going out with the accused ex, were both still schoolgirls at the time of the incident at a nightclub in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dundee">Dundee</a> .</p>
      <p>Sheriff Tom Hughes rejected defence pleas not to jail Gaffar, a first offender, now 19, labelling her actions outrageous and "reprehensible".</p>
      <p>He said the law imposed a presumption against custody in the case of people under 21.</p>
      <p>But he said: "I make no bones about it, if I had been dealing with an adult, I'd talking about a considerable number of years in prison.</p>
      <p>"This can only be described as a brutal attack and there's been absolute outrage in the community as a result of what happened.</p>
      <p>"The court cannot tolerate young people being involved in this type of behaviour.</p>
      <p>"I have to take into account your age, that you were of previous good character, have been in no trouble since, and are genuinely remorseful.</p>
      <p>"But I have to take the view that a custodial sentence is the only possible way of dealing with this because of the severe and brutal nature of the attack."</p>

      <p>Gaffar shook visibly in the dock.</p>
      <p>Her victim, who was on the public benches at Dundee Sheriff <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">Court</a> to hear the sentence, gasped, "Thank God."</p>
      <p>Members of Gaffar's family shouted, "Stay strong, Danielle" as Gaffar was handcuffed and led to the cells.</p>
      <p>Gaffar, of Tealing, Dundee, pleaded guilty in October to assaulting Miss Strachan to her severe injury and permanent disfigurement in the incident on February 3rd (2019), and sentence had been deferred for reports.</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Jim Laverty said that parliament had laid down that in the case of under-21s, where a "credible alternative" to custody existed, it should be used.</p>
      <p>He said Gaffar had saved £1,000 to pay Miss Strachan compensation, if this were ordered.</p>
      <p>He said: "That's not as a blood payment, it's a true expression of Miss Gaffar's remorse and her acceptance of her responsibility.</p>
      <p>"This was a fleeting moment of madness and loss of self control which will never be repeated."</p>
      <p>Mr Laverty added that Gaffar had received death threats on social media.</p>
      <p>He said: "She has received death threats, she has received threats, and she has lost a job because of the publicity of this case."</p>
      <p>The court heard that Gaffar and Miss Strachan, who were both 18 and at school at the time, were formerly close friends but there had been a "disagreement" between them and there remained some animosity.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor Kirsten Letford said: "At, the time of the offence the complainer was in a relationship with a man who was formerly the partner of the accused."</p>
      <p>Mrs Letford said Miss Strachan had been on the dance floor of the Aura nightclub when she was attacked from behind, pulled to the ground, and her head was banged off the floor several times.</p>
      <p>At first she had no idea who her attacker was, but she then saw it was Gaffar.</p>
      <p>A friend of Miss Strachan's tried to intervene, but Gaffar put her arm around Miss Strachan's throat so she was struggling to breathe.</p>
      <p>Mrs Letford said: "The accused then bit her on the right cheek."</p>
      <p>Gaffar was ejected, and police were called.</p>
      <p>Miss Strachan was taken to the city's Ninewells Hospital where eight stitches were inserted in her cheek to repair the bite mark.</p>
      <p>Mrs Letford described it as "a significant wound" that would leave permanent scarring. She also suffered bruising to her face and forehead.</p>
      <p>The court heard it was thanks to "the skill of medical staff" that the effects of the attack were not more noticeable.</p>
      <p>Outside court, Miss Strachan said: "I'm happy with the sentence, she deserved it."</p>
      <p>Her mother, Gemma Leonard, said: "It means Kyra can draw a line under it and move on with her life. Our family can move on. Her family will have to deal with the consequences of her actions."</p>
