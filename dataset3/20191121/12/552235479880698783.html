      <h2>Former Aberdeen team-mate Fraser Fyvie shared the old snap on Twitter.</h2>

      <p>There's nothing like a good old throwback to get your pals blushing.</p>
      <p>Before <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/ryan-jack">Ryan Jack</a> was captaining Aberdeen or starring under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> at Rangers, he was a fresh-faced youngster in the Dons' youth academy.</p>
      <p>The midfielder emerged through the ranks at Pittodrie as a kid, alongside Fraser Fyvie.</p>
      <p>And those days were revisited by the Cove Rangers player in the form a classic picture.</p>
      <p>It shows the pair in their early Aberdeen days, grinning for the camera.</p>
      <p>Much has changed since then, clearly, although the pair are still identifiable despite the picture's age.</p>
      <p>Fyvie wrote: "What about that for a #ThrowbackThursday guess who"</p>
      <p>Fyvie became <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> 's youngest-ever player when he debuted at 16 in 2009, while Jack made his league bow a year later in 2010 against, funnily enough, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .</p>
      <p>Fyvie departed for Wigan Athletic in 2012, with Jack remaining in the north east until 2017 before eventually sealing his switch to Ibrox.</p>
