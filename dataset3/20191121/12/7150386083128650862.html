      <p><b>Beijing:</b> China on Thursday said it’s striving for an initial “phase one” deal with the US as both sides continue to maintain close communication.</p>
      <p>“China is ready to work with the US side to properly address each other’s core concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect and will strive to reach a ‘phase one’ deal, which serves the interests of both countries and the rest of the world,” Xinhua quoted Chinese Commerce Ministry Spokesperson Gao Feng as saying to reporters.</p>
      <p>“There is no further information on details of the consultation over the deal, but hearsay about the issue is not accurate,” he said.</p>
      <p>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chief of the Chinese side of the China-US comprehensive economic dialogue, held a phone conversation at the request of US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>During their talks, the two sides had constructive discussions on each other’s core concerns in the “phase one” deal, Feng said.</p>
