      <h2>Why is some of the best education reserved for children who follow a religion?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:42:57+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:42</time> by <a rel="author">Will Hayward</a></address>
      <p>In Wales we have a serious problem with our religious schools.</p>
      <p>Let me describe a situation that happens all the time under our current education system.</p>
      <p>There is a secondary school on a street in a city like <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/news-opinion/die-no-one-seems-care-15833970">Cardiff</a> .</p>
      <p>That school is faith school that follows the Catholic religion.</p>
      <p>The school is funded by the taxpayer and is considered the best school in the area.</p>
      <p>Because it is so popular it is massively over subscribed.</p>
      <p>Rhys is a boy in year who lives on the same street as that school. He will soon be applying for secondary school. His mother has a good job and pays lots of taxes which in turn fund the school.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, because that school is oversubscribed the Welsh government allows them to select their students based on faith.</p>
      <p>Rhys may not be allowed to go to that school because he is not Catholic. Instead that place can be given to a child from 20 miles away, whose parents have decided to raise him Catholic.</p>
      <p>Instead of walking one minute to school Rhys must now either catch a bus everyday across town. Or perhaps his mum will have to drop him off before heading to work in the opposite direction.</p>
      <p>Think that system absolutely stinks? You are not alone.</p>
      <p>A survey last year by Censuswide found only 17% of people thought publicly funded schools should be able to select pupils on the grounds of their religious beliefs.</p>
      <p>I want to articulate why this current system is not just unfair, but also cruel and damaging to us all.</p>
      <p>Before I do however I need to lay down a few ground rules and assumptions so we are all singing from the same hymn sheet (lol):</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Religion is a choice. No child is born with a religion. It is taught to them (usually by their parents).</li>
        <li>The religious institutions are not doing the state a favour, it is our money funding these schools.</li>
        <li>Faith, by definition, is belief in something in the absence of fact.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Right first things first, is this actually happening? Yes.</p>
      <p>As an example, take a look at the <a href="https://corpuschristihs.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/document/Admissions-Policy-2020.pdf?t=1569925552">selection criteria</a> for Corpus Christi Catholic High School in Lisvane, Cardiff.</p>
      <p>In the case of over superscription, six out of the seven priorities for selection involve the child being baptised.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Looked after or previously looked after Baptised Catholic children.</li>
        <li>Looked after or previously looked after non-Catholic children.</li>
        <li>Baptised Catholic children (a) residing in the catchment area and (b) attending a designated Catholic Primary School.</li>
        <li>Baptised Catholic brothers or sisters of pupils already in the school at the time of determination and who will be pupils at the time the applicant commences at the school.</li>
        <li>Baptised Catholic children (a) residing in the catchment area and (b) attending a non-designated Catholic Primary School. 6</li>
        <li>Baptised Catholic children residing in the catchment area.</li>
        <li>Other Baptised Catholic children.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Only then are non-Catholics residing in the catchment area considered and even then they have to be attending a designated Catholic primary school.</p>
      <p>In all these cases a copy of the baptismal certificate is needed as proof.</p>
      <p>Now this is not to pick on this school in particular. This is just an example and the school has plenty of non Catholic students.</p>
      <p>It is not even picking on the Catholic Church - all faiths are allowed to do this.</p>
      <p>It quite an awful state of affairs when a school is allowed to say that one child is less deserving of state funds because their parents have taught them to worship the “wrong” god.</p>
      <p>This is not to mention the complete hypocrisy of saying a child shouldn’t get a place because they worship the “right god” but in the “wrong way” like if a Catholic kid applied to a Protestant school.</p>
      <p>Beyond all of this is the societal costs to us all of this policy which forces us to live in our little bubbles.</p>
      <p>At a time when we all seem to be more divided than ever, wouldn’t it be better for our schools (whatever faith they be), to expose young people to the peers of all faiths and none?</p>
      <p>Wouldn’t that breed empathy and compassion for other people’s beliefs rather than creating the “them and us” attitude we see in our political discourse.</p>
      <p>Surely if a child has come to their religious opinions after hearing and seeing other points of view their faith will be all the stronger for the experience?</p>
      <p>Ultimately I believe that the state should not fund any religious school.</p>
      <p>The UK government’s own toolkit on freedom of religion states that human rights law gives parents and legal guardians the right to educate their children in accordance with their religion.</p>
      <p>Despite this, it adds that “the state is not obliged to actively participate or provide resources to assist parents in such religious education” and that “parents do not have a right to state funding for confessional religious teaching or religious schools that are in line with their own beliefs”.</p>
      <p>However while we are stuck with these religious institutions running schools they should not be able to select who has the right to tax payers money.</p>
      <p>This is by no means a Wales only issue. It is the same in England.</p>
      <p>However education is a devolved issue therefore it is within the Welsh Government’s ability to make this change. The sooner the better.</p>
