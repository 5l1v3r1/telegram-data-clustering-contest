      <h1>What the anti-apartheid poster in Rachel Riley's t-shirt actually said</h1>

      <p>Countdown presenter Rachel Riley has been criticised for posing in a t-shirt showing a doctored photo of Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>In the picture, the Labour leader holds a placard saying: ‘Jeremy Corbyn is a racist endeavour’.</p>
      <p>But what did the poster say before it was edited?</p>
      <p>The original photo was taken outside the South African embassy in London in 1984, during a protest demanding Nelson Mandela’s release from prison.</p>
      <p>It shows Corbyn being led away by two police officers for defying a ban on demonstrating outside.</p>
      <p>The original placard reads: ‘Defend the right to protest against apartheid. Join this picket.’</p>

      <p>Heavily pregnant Riley is facing calls to resign from Countdown for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/rachel-riley-sparks-backlash-erasing-jeremy-corbyns-anti-apartheid-message-photoshopped-t-shirt-11192944/">erasing the message and replacing it with an accusation of Mr Corbyn being himself racist. </a></p>

      <p>One person tweeted: ‘Dislike corbyn, whatever – it’s a free country – but jfc a white person doing this shows a complete detachment from reality. Precisely the kind of behaviour rewarded by the media (as long as you attack the left).’</p>
      <p>Another read: ‘This is, without doubt, the craziest thing I’ve seen on Twitter. A white person erasing an anti-apartheid message is new levels of bizarre. It’s something you expect from the alt-right. This person has fronted ‘anti-trolling’ campaigns. Good grief.’</p>
      <p>While one critic wrote: ‘Did my girl actually erase the anti-apartheid message to do this?? ‘I. Can. Friggin. NOT. It’s not just any old message you’re erasing. It was a friggin struggle against severe and brutal legalised racism.’</p>

      <p>Riley, who is Jewish, has been a vocal critic of Labour’s handling of anti-Semitism and has regularly accused Mr Corbyn of failing to properly address the issue.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the TV debate between Mr Corbyn and Boris Johnson in Salford’s Media City on Tuesday, she tweeted: ‘I didn’t feel comfortable knowing my workplace was to be full of racists tonight. I don’t endorse Boris, but I do endorse Never Corbyn.’</p>
      <p>Riley responded to criticism by referencing claims that Nelson Mandela declined to meet Mr Corbyn’s anti-apartheid movement CLAAG (City of London Anti-Apartheid Group).</p>
      <p>She said on Twitter: ‘Without feeding individual ignorant trolls, this is why I have no qualms using this photo to highlight Corbyn’s racism.’</p>

      <p>During the ITV Leaders’ Debate between Mr Corbyn and the Prime Minister on Tuesday, the Labour leader said anti-Semitism was ‘an absolute evil and scourge within our society’.</p>

      <p>When asked further about the issue by host Julie Etchingham, Mr Corbyn responded: ‘I have taken action in my party, where anyone who has committed any anti-Semitic acts or made any anti-Semitic statements, they are either suspended or expelled from the party and we’ve investigated every single case.’</p>
      <p>After the debate, Jewish Labour Movement national secretary Peter Mason alleged the claim that every case had been investigated was a ‘lie’, adding: ‘There are at least 130 outstanding anti-Semitism cases, some dating back years, that still haven’t been dealt with.’</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Labour Party declined to comment on the incident involving Riley.</p>
