      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:35:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/364391-bayelsa-poll-inec-presents-certificate-of-return-to-lyon-deputy.html" target="_blank">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday, presented Certificate of Return to Bayelsa Governor-elect, David Lyon and his deputy Degi Eremienyo.</p>
      <p>INEC National Commissioner in charge of Rivers, Bayelsa and Edo, May Agbamuche-Mbu, presented the certificates at a ceremony in Yenogoa.</p>
      <p>Mrs Agbamuche-Mbu expressed gratitude to all stakeholders including the police, army, traditional rulers, women groups and the youth for abiding by the electoral law to record the “most violence free- poll in the state”.</p>
      <p>Observer reports contradict the position of the INEC official about the election being “most violence free-poll”.</p>
      <p>Speaking after receiving the certificate, Mr Lyon dedicated his victory to the people of the state, whom he said made it possible for him to win the poll.</p>
      <p>Mr Lyon also commended the Nigeria Police Force and the Department of State Service (DSS) for living up to their responsibilities during the election.</p>
      <p>“I thank INEC for its commitment towards the election in spite of pressure to do otherwise.</p>
      <p>“To all the people of Bayelsa, this is the time to come together to build our dear state; my victory at the poll is for the people and I am assuring you, my people, that I will not fail you.</p>
      <p>“The APC led administration will be for a total change which Bayelsa is going to be witnessing in the next few months; my belief in this context is that, everyone is a winner.</p>
      <p>“Let us come together and ensure that the state is developed and there will be security for investors,” Mr Lyon said.</p>
      <p>Mr Lyon polled 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr Duoye Diri, who scored 143,172 votes in the Nov. 16, governorship poll.(NAN)</p>
