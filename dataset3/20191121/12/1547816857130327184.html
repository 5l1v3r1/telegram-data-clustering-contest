      <p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, once Hollywood’s most loved couple, left their fans shocked with the news of their divorce three years ago back in 2016. The two had been married for two years and Angelina shares six children with Brad Pitt namely, Zahara, Shiloh, Vivienne, Maddox, Pax, and Knox. Brad and Angelina’s divorce is always in the headlines for some reason or other, since the couple is still sorting out their differences over the divorce settlement. However, looks like Brad might be moving on and was spotted hanging out with Arrested Development star Alia Shawkat.</p>
      <p>Brad Pitt was spotted at an art gallery with the 30-year-old actress Alia Shawkat and the snaps that have surfaced on the Internet show both of them at the same gallery, however, in the pictures they cannot be seen talking with each other. Instead, they can be seen chatting with other people present at the art gallery. Meral Melika Duran took to Instagram to share pictures of Brad Pitt and Alia Shawkat and wrote, “Supporting arts &amp; artist, as usual, Thank you, Brad Pitt, for joining us Had the pleasure to introduce my great artist friend Martin Werthmann to Brad (please check out his work). I had a very interesting conversation with Brad. Like is a positive attitude.” Check out the pictures: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/hollywood/hollywood_news/post-messy-divorce-with-brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-has-been-on-a-few-dates-but-will-never-get-married-again/5dce9b8d87fb571eff7e3ec9">ALSO READ: Post-Messy Divorce With Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie Has Been On A Few Dates But Will Never Get Married Again</a></p>
