      <p><b>MOSCOWÂ (AP)</b> - Russia's lower house of parliament has passed a bill that gives the government the right to register bloggers, journalists and social media users as foreign agents.</p>
      <p>The bill, which was almost unanimously approved by the State Duma on Thursday, extends an existing law involving foreign-funded media outlets. That was adopted in 2017 in response to the decision by the U.S. Justice Department to label the Russian state-funded RT television a foreign agent.</p>
      <p>The new law can apply to anyone who distributes content produced by media outlets registered as foreign agents and receives payments from abroad.</p>
      <p>The move has been criticized by many in Russia for restricting freedom of expression in Russia even further and allowing the authorities to crack down on dissent.</p>
