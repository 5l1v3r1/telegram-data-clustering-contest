      <p>A 30-year-old teacher who allegedly bought a cellphone for a learner so that they could share nude pictures with each other will appear in the Kabokweni Magistrates Court in Mbombela, Mpumalanga on Friday.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Brigadier Leonard Hlathi says the teacher already made his first appearance and is now expected to bring a formal bail application.</p>
      <p>He says the teacher will be charged with Child Grooming as well as for supplying, exposing and displaying pornographic material to a minor.</p>
      <p>Hlathi says it is alleged that the mother of a 14-year-old girl entered her room on the 5th of November and saw her daughter hiding an unknown cellphone under her pillow.</p>
      <p>The woman confronted the child who eventually admitted that the teacher had given it to her.</p>
      <p>Hlathi says the mother then went through the phone and found pornographic pictures that were exchanged between the man and her daughter.</p>
      <p>Police were immediately informed and two cases were opened.</p>
      <p>The Provincial Police Commissioner of Mpumalanga Lieutenant General Mondi Zuma welcomed the arrest and expressed his disappointment and disgust displayed by the accused.</p>
