        <b>Kyle Edmund commenced Great Britain's crunch Davis Cup clash with Kazakhstan on a winning-note with a 6-3 6-3 victory over Mikhail Kukushkin in the opening rubber.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Edmund wasn't part of the team's opening round against the Netherlands and came into the team as the No 2 singles player for this decisive clash.</p>
      <p>Leon Smith had elected to field Edmund and Dan Evans for the two singles matches with Andy Murray supporting from the team bench. Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski retained their places for the doubles rubber.</p>
      <p>On court at the Caja Magica in Madrid, Edmund cut a determined figure as he raced to a straight-sets win pver Kukushkin, who is ranked two places higher than him.</p>

      <p>The Brit was named late as the fifth member of Great Britain's squad and pipped Cameron Norrie to the post after a strong run at the Paris Masters.</p>
      <p>"Today I just wanted to go on court and really give it my all. It was such a buzz to thrive off this crowd. Davis Cup, playing for your country - it doesn't get any better," Edmund said.</p>

      <p>Edmund's performance set exactly the right tone for the day from a Great Britain perspective.</p>
      <p>He struck his hefty groundstrokes with authority, pounced on any short balls and stayed tough in the face of any pressure, saving all the break points he faced.</p>
      <p>"The job's half done so we really need to push it home now," Edmund added.</p>
      <p>The second rubber of the day will be a clash between the British No 1 Dan Evans and the world No 57 Alexander Bublik.</p>
      <p>If Evans is able to emulate Edmund's result then Great Britain's place in the quarter-finals will be confirmed.</p>
