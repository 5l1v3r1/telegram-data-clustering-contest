      <p>Labour is promising to deliver the “substantial majority” of the emissions cuts needed to tackle the climate emergency by 2030.</p>
      <p>The party’s manifesto has a strong focus on the environment, amid widespread concern over the issue, with a majority of people in a recent poll saying climate change would influence their vote in the next general election.</p>
      <p>Labour is promising a “green industrial revolution” to deliver a million jobs, and says its “green new deal” aims to achieve the substantial majority of greenhouse gas reductions by 2030 in a way that is fair to workers and communities.</p>
      <p>The manifesto also contains ambitions to put the UK on track for a “net zero” energy system within the 2030s and for British food production to reach net zero carbon by 2040 – which is in line with the farming sector’s plans.</p>
      <p>The ambitions represent less stringent targets than the pledge to work towards a path to net zero carbon emissions by 2030, which was agreed at the party conference in September, but faced criticism it would be unachievable.</p>
      <p>But it appears more ambitious than the Liberal Democrats’ pledge for a new legally binding target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045, or the Government’s 2050 target which became law in the summer.</p>
      <p>Labour says it will be backed by a “green transformation fund” of £250 billion to produce the shift to a green economy, funding renewables, low-carbon energy and transport, wildlife and environmental restoration.</p>
      <p>The manifesto promises a windfall tax on oil companies, to help cover the costs of climate damage, and to “immediately and permanently ban fracking”.</p>
      <p>And it confirms pledges already announced by Labour to upgrade almost all of the UK’s 27 million homes to the highest energy-efficiency standards, and build thousands of new offshore and onshore wind turbines.</p>
      <p>It also restates pledges to nationalise energy and water utilities.</p>
