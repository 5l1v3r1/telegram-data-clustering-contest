      <p>The Madras High Court on Tuesday (19 November) dismissed DMK MP Kanimozhi’s plea to reject the petition challenging her election to Lok Sabha from the Tuticorin constituency, reports Times of India.</p>
      <p>The judgement was given by Justice SM Subramaniam, who said that the petition is fit for hearing while rejecting the plea made by Kanimozhi.</p>
      <p>The petition was filed by a voter named Santhanakumar from the constituency alleging that Kanimozhi wilfully failed to disclose her husband’s income in the nomination filed for contesting the 2019 lok sabha election from Tuticorin and had bribed the voters.</p>
      <p>As per <a href="https://swarajyamag.com/insta/newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2019/nov/20/kanimozhis-plea-to-reject-petition-against-her-dismissed-2064245.html">reports</a>, counsel for Kanimozhi submitted that her husband is a citizen of Singapore and does not hold a PAN card and hence there was no necessity to submit an income statement. The judge said that only after the investigation of the case, a conclusion can be arrived at.</p>
