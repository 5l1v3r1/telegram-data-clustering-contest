      <p>Up to 16 people have been discovered in a truck on a ferry bound for Rosslare Europort in Co <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Wexford">Wexford</a>.</p>
      <p>Stena Line, which owns the ferry carrying the truck where the people were found, confirmed the discovery in a statement this morning.</p>
      <p>The people, who have told staff on the ferry they are from a country in the Middle East, were discovered after banging was heard during a routine inspection on the car deck of the Stena Horizon.</p>
      <p>It is thought the truck is owned by a local freight firm based in Co Wexford.</p>
      <p>The container they were found in was sealed and locked, but it is understood that it was opened within five minutes of the banging being heard.</p>
      <p>“All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees. Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials inRosslare so the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel’s arrival in Rosslare,” Stena said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The ferry was travelling on its usual route from Cherbourg, where it departed from yesterday evening.</p>
      <p>It is currently in the Irish Sea and is expected to dock in Rosslare at 3.30pm .</p>
      <p>Tánaiste Simon Coveney told the Dáil on Thursday gardaí will work closely with police services across the EU to deal with the trafficking of the 16 people found on a ferry bound for Rosslare Europort.</p>
      <p>Mr Coveney said trafficking “is criminal activity that doesn’t respect borders” and said gardaí were working closely with the PSNI in relation to the deaths of 39 migrants trafficked to the UK.</p>
      <p>They would also work with other police services in different parts of the EU in relation to this case also.</p>
      <p>Mr Coveney defended the Government’s approach to dealing with human trafficking after Fianna Fáil TD Robert Troy highlighted the case of the migrants found on the ferry bound for Rosslare port.</p>
      <p>Mr Troy asked what Ireland was doing to ensure “we don’t become a destination of choice for people carrying out that awful dreadful trafficking of human beings”.</p>
      <p>He said the annual trafficking in persons report for a second year in a row down-graded Ireland’s response because the authorities failed to initiate any prosecutions in 2018.</p>
      <p>The report also identified “chronic deficiencies in victim identification and referral and assistance”.</p>
      <p>Mr Coveney insisted that the Government is fully committed to addressing human trafficking with a number of initiatives in place as well as significant Garda resources for investigation and prosecution of human trafficking.</p>
