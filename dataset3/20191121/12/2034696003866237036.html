      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-heartless">The Heartless</a> have released their eponymous debut single, and revealed that their upcoming TV show is a combination of “<i>Almost Famous</i> meets <i>Withnail &amp; I</i>“.</p>
      <p>The brainchild of <a href="http://nme.com/artists/the-libertines">Libertines</a> guitarist <a href="http://nme.com/artists/carl-barat">Carl Barat</a> and his sister Lucie, The Heartless<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/carl%E2%80%A6"> was assembled earlier this year</a> for an upcoming TV series loosely inspired by The Likely Lads’ rise to fame in 00’s London.</p>
      <p>“It’s a series that follows a band inspired by The Libertines,” Lucie told <i>NME</i>. “It’s based on when Carl and I shared a flat in the ’00s, so it’s a character driven piece about a group of people – the core of which is Carl and his band. It’s based on that period and based on his experiences.”</p>
      <p>As the band debut their debut single today, they insist that they’re aiming to becoming respected artists in their own right too – and nothing like <a href="http://nme.com/artists/SPINAL-TAP">Spinal Tap.</a></p>
      <p>“It’s all up in the air, about how much separation there is between the band and the TV show,” The Heartless tell <i>NME</i>. “But we definitely want to be a legit band and it’s not a gimmick to play into the story of the show. We’re a band in our own right too.”</p>

      <p>The TV show, meanwhile, sees the Barat siblings teaming up with producer Zoe Rocha and RubyRock Productions.</p>
      <p>“It’s <i>Almost Famous</i> meets <i>Withnail and I</i>, that’s how it was pitched in the very first place,” the band said of the show. “That’s the attractive prospect, Spinal Tap is seminal but this is a hard hitting punk drama.”</p>
      <p>The band – which features singer Ellie James, guitarist Lewis Rainer, bassist Dominic Gilday and drummer Jay Bone – will also celebrate their first single with an upcoming gig at Brighton’s Prince Albert.</p>
      <p>Carl Barat added: “It’s both frightening and wonderful that the early ’00s are now far enough behind us to justify revisiting. It was an incredible and a very different time.</p>
      <p>“I’m feeling the excitement for this project that I felt for my own band in 2002. Happy to be able to make something of the mental experiences I shared with my amazing sister too.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Barat is currently on the<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-libertines-add-margate-show-to-their-december-uk-tour-2550782"> road with the Libertines once more across November and December</a> – including a massive date at London’s O2 Academy Brixton.</p>
