        <b>Godwin Isenyo, Kaduna</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted six persons including a nursing mother with her three-week-old baby at Hayin Danmani Community in Igabi Local Government Area of Kaduna State.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the incident took place on Tuesday night but community residents got to know about it on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Our correspondent also gathered that the kidnappers may have returned to the community on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>A source said, “We heard gunshots yesterday (Wednesday) night and it is possible that they (kidnappers) revisited.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was also gathered that the kidnappers contacted the family of one of the victims and demanded a ransom of N10 million.</p>
      <p>A source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told our correspondent that when the gunmen invaded the community, they shot indiscriminately and went from house-to-house to pick their victims.</p>
      <p>One of the community leaders said the residents of the community were not living in fear.</p>
      <p>He said while the kidnappers picked the nursing mother and her three-week-old baby, her husband managed to escape.</p>
      <p>He added that the kidnappers made away with six other people, who were mostly peasants.</p>
      <p>He said, “The incident actually took place on Tuesday night but the community discovered the abduction yesterday (Wednesday) morning.</p>
      <p>“We learnt that they made away with a nursing mother and her three-week-old baby.</p>
      <p>“You know that Mahuta, Mando, Rigasa, Danmani communities share common boundaries with Dogon Daji which lead to Birnin Gwari, where a military operation is ongoing. It is possible that the military operation is becoming unbearable for the bandits. So, they are being pushed into the communities mentioned.”</p>
      <p>As of the time of filing this report, the State Command of the Police had yet to confirm the incident as the spokesman of the command, DSP Yakubu Sabo didn’t respond to our correspondent’s telephone call.</p>
