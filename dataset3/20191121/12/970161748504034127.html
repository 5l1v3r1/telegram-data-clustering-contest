      <p>The Chase will be turning itself up to 11 as Bradley Walsh and the gang return for a brand-new quiz based on the hit gameshow.</p>
      <p>After host Bradley teased a ‘<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/bradley-walsh-confirms-proper-shake-chase-will-joining-chasers-11180840/">major shake-up for the show’,</a> it’s been confirmed by ITV that the five beloved quizmasters will be forming a team for new series, Beat The Chasers.</p>
      <p>Basically…good luck to everyone who wants to take part!</p>
      <p>Anne Hegerty, Mark Labbett, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jenny-ryan/">Jenny Ryan</a>, Paul Sinha and Shaun Wallace have all be confirmed to be appearing on the show, competing together as contestants play against them.</p>
      <p>Earning some major cash in the process, obviously.</p>
      <p>So it doesn’t disrupt the usual fun of The Chase weekday instalments, Beat The Chasers will be taken for a test-run across one week next year.</p>
      <p>Michael Kelpie, Managing Director of production company Potato, said of the news: ‘For quiz fans, this is the equivalent of competing in the Olympics or playing in an FA Cup Final. It’s the ultimate challenge against the greatest quiz team ever assembled.</p>

      <p>‘In this brand new format, anyone who thinks they’re clever enough can take on the nation’s favourite quizzers.’</p>

      <p>Katie Rawcliffe, Head of Entertainment, ITV added: ‘It’s so exciting to be expanding the award-winning The Chase format.</p>
      <p>‘Chasers and contestants alike will really need to hold their nerve to come out victorious in this new spin on the quizzing format.’</p>
      <p>The announcement comes as fans demanded to know where the show had gone, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/isnt-chase-bradley-walsh-fave-replaced-cash-trapped-11080442/">it was replaced earlier this month</a> with another Bradley-led quiz, Cash Trapped.</p>

      <p>The team were quick to assure it was only for five weeks though, and then the gameshow will be back for another round.</p>
      <p>When the normal series returns, it looks like there might be a new face to be dealing with after it was revealed there would be a new<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/chases-bradley-walsh-announces-brand-new-chaser-signed-join-jenny-ryan-team-11077550/"> quizmaster joining the ranks</a>.</p>
      <p>Currently, Jenny Ryan – aka the Vixen from the show – has traded in her killer knowledge to show off her <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/27/x-factor-celebritys-jenny-ryan-hits-back-claims-mimed-last-nights-live-show-10993475/">singing voice on X Factor Celebrity</a>, making it to the semi finals.</p>
      <p>We know she said <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/x-factor-celebritys-jenny-ryan-wants-chase-supergroup-paul-sinha-anne-hegerty-10980531/">she wanted a Chase supergroup</a>…but we don’t think this is what she had in mind!</p>
