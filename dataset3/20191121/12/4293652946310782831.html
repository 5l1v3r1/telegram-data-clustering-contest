      <h1>White Sox sign catcher Yasmani Grandal to four-year, $73M deal</h1>

      <p>CHICAGO — All-Star catcher <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/players/yasmani-grandal/392198">Yasmani Grandal</a> agreed to a $73 million, four-year contract with the <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/baseball/mlb/teams/chicago-white-sox/">Chicago White Sox</a>, finding a more lucrative free-agent market now that he no longer is burdened by draft-pick compensation.</p>
      <p>Grandal will earn $18.25 million annually as part of the deal announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>He turned down a $17.9 million qualifying offer from the Los Angeles Dodgers last November. A team signing him during the 2018-19 off-season would lose a top amateur draft pick and he found a slow market, agreeing in January to a deal with Milwaukee that guaranteed $18.25 million: a $16 million salary for 2019 and a $16 million mutual option for 2020 with a $2.25 million buyout.</p>
      <p>Selected for the All-Star team for the second time, the 31-year-old hit .246 and had career bests with 28 homers and 77 RBIs. He declined to exercise his part of the option and became a free agent again.</p>
      <p>A free agent may only be given a qualifying offer once, so there was no draft-pick compensation attached this off-season.</p>
      <p>Grandal would earn a $100,000 bonus if voted AL MVP. $90,000 for finishing second, $80,000 for third, $70,000 for fourth and $60,000 for fifth. He would get $100,000 for World Series MVP, $75,000 for League Championship Series MVP, $50,000 if he is selected an All-Star by The Sporting News, $25,000 each if he starts in the All-Star Game or wins a Gold Glove, and $15,000 apiece if he is an All-Star reserve or wins a Silver Slugger.

      <p>Chicago thinks it is poised for a jump after seven losing seasons.</p>
