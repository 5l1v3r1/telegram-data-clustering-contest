      <p><a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Kacey-Musgraves">Kacey Mugraves</a> appeared on <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/Jimmy-Fallon">The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</a> on Wednesday night to promote her upcoming <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/kacey-musgraves-christmas-special-on-amazon-prime-46847789">Christmas special with Amazon Prime Video</a>, which will be released later this month. Along with discussing her newfound status as a triple threat (she sings, dances, and tries her hand at comedy in the holiday special), she also debuted one of her brand new festive tunes, "Glittery." Musgraves attended the premiere for her Christmas special the night before dressed in <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/kacey-musgraves-white-outfit-holiday-special-screening-46925094">a very on-theme sparkling outfit</a>, and it was a similar story on Wednesday. Appearing on Fallon, wearing a head-to-toe glittering pantsuit, she was surrounded by dozens of sparkling presents (all in varying shades of pink) while singing her new song "Glittery" in front of the live studio audience for the first time. In the special, titled <b>The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show</b>, the country singer will be joined by a long list of celebrities for musical performances and comedy sketches.
