      <p><a href="https://belong.life/">Belong.Life</a>, a free social network and app for cancer patients, has partnered with the <a href="https://www.mybreast.org.za/">Breast Health Foundation</a> (BHF) and <a href="http://pinkparasol.co.za/">The Pink Parasol Project</a> to provide support to those living with breast cancer in SA.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the organisations say they will work together to improve the quality of life for breast cancer patients by increasing access to authentic and trusted medical information, connecting individuals to medical and patient support communities and providing personalised tools to assist throughout the cancer journey.</p>
      <p>“The Breast Health Foundation and Pink Parasol project are delighted to collaborate with Belong.Life. This partnership will result in an integrated platform that shares medical and psycho-social support to all affected by breast cancer in South Africa,” says Louise Turner, COO of BHF.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2015, Belong allows cancer patients and their support network to explore and better manage the treatment journey and improve quality of life.</p>
      <p>In SA, it is estimated that 3.6%, or one in 28, women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.</p>
      <p>Dubbed Belong – Beating Cancer Together, Belong.Life’s mobile app is used by more than 200 000 cancer patients and caregivers around the world, providing customised information about treatment and recovery, clinical trial matching, emotional support forums, as well as direct access to medical experts, providers, support programmes and more.</p>

      <p>According to the statement, Belong.Life uses a hyper-personalised patient engagement mobile app powered by proprietary algorithm and artificial intelligence to deliver customised content for each user.</p>
      <p>In addition, data from the Belong.Life platform has been used to support international research projects recognised by the global oncology community, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the European Society of Medical Oncology.</p>
      <p>“While breast cancer is common all around the world, gaps in education, lack of support and access to medical professionals persist,” notes Eliran Malki, co-founder and CEO of Belong.Life.</p>
      <p>“We are thrilled to expand our footprint to South Africa with our distinguished partners, BHF and The Pink Parasol Project, as they join our growing list of global partners including the American Cancer Society, GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer and Colorectal Cancer Canada, among others. Together, we will further our shared vision to improve the quality of life for cancer patients and their families.”</p>
