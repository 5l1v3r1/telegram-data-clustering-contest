      <p>Scottish craft brewery BrewDog is now accepting reservations for its latest hotel concept that includes dog beds for your pup and shower beers in every room.</p>
      <p>At the Aberdeen Kennels, each guest will receive a welcome beer at check-in and all rooms come with a beer fridge to dip into when showering.</p>

      <p>Inspired by its <a href="https://www.insider.com/brewdog-brewery-beer-hotel-in-ohio-2018-8">DogHouse Hotel concept</a> in Columbus, Ohio, the new BrewDog Kennels aim to bring the same spirit to a series of mini city-center hotels in some of the world’s busiest destinations.</p>

      <p>The first BrewDog Kennels will launch in the brand’s home city of Aberdeen, Scotland, where bookings are now open, as well as in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
      <p>The company also plans to open sites in London, Manchester, Paris, and Berlin.</p>
      <p>The BrewDog Kennels Aberdeen will also host beer-themed experiences and excursions, such as an accompanied visit to its brewery in nearby Ellon or taking part in “Beer School” at its Castlegate bar below the hotel.</p>
      <p>BrewDog cofounder James Watt commented: “Our BrewDog Kennels are a revolution in accommodation, sparked by too much time spent in immediately forgettable hotel rooms.”</p>
      <p>“We firmly believe that where you stay in a new city should be your home from home, so have brought the spirit of our DogHouse Hotel and its reverence for great beer to a new series of mini-hotels.”</p>
      <p>Prices for rooms start <a href="https://www.brewdog.com/locations/hotels/brewdog-kennels/aberdeen">from £75</a>.</p>
