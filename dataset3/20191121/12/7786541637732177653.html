      <p><b>LYNN, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - The death of a good Samaritan who was struck and killed at a traffic accident scene has been ruled an accident,</p>
      <p>Lehigh County authorities say 49-year-old Lloyd Musick, of Summit Hill, died from blunt force injuries suffered in Tuesday's accident on Route 309 in Lynn. Two other people who tried to help were also injured.</p>
      <p>Pennsylvania state police say a car and a pickup truck were involved in the initial accident, and three other vehicles soon stopped to help. As the occupants of the latter three vehicles were getting out, a passing minivan struck those vehicles.</p>
      <p>Musick was pronounced dead at the scene. Another good Samaritan was seriously injured and was flown to a hospital.</p>
      <p>The cause of the accidents remains under investigation.</p>
