      <h1>Here’s what Ira Khan has to say about directing father Aamir Khan in a film</h1>

      <p>Super Star Aamir Khan’s daughter Ira is soon going to don the director’s hat for a Greek play called ‘Medea’. The actress expressed her interest in Greek mythology in her interview with a leading online portal said she finds it interesting and dramatic.</p>
      <p>When asked about when she will be seen on camera, Ira confessed that she isn’t comfortable on camera and finds direction more interesting. On being quizzed about when will she be directing her father Aamir Khan she said "Maybe someday, when I have a better understanding of the craft. Working with somebody you know personally can be complicated, and that’s not specifically for my dad, but applies to everyone. I want to be sure of myself before I work with my dad because he is really well-read, like everybody else in the family. So, when I’m sure about myself, I will think about directing him."</p>

      <p>Ira also confessed that she is a ‘control freak’ like her dad. When they start working on a project they are completely focused on it and forget everything else.  Ira seems to be quite a perfectionist just like her dad. While the lady is busy with her directorial debut, Aamir is currently busy shooting for Laal Singh Chaddha with Kareena Kapoor Khan in Chandigarh. Helmed by Advait Chauhan the film is a remake of the movie Forrest Gump that starred Tom Hanks.</p>
