      <p>Roger Federer is called the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) and for all the right reasons.</p>
      <p>The Wimbeldon player is making headlines again and this time for his posing skills. While playing against Sascha Zverev during one of the tour matches in Buenos Aires, a fan asked Roger Federer to pose for a picture.</p>
      <p>And what happened after that is exactly why he is the greatest of all time.</p>
      <p>The video of the entire incident was shared on Twitter with the caption, "Apparently one of the fans asked Federer to stand still so he could take a good picture."</p>

      <p>The 38-year-old obliged to the request and started posing for the fan sitting in the court. He did not stop after just one picture, he started giving some great angles which must have made for some great shots. Magazine cover worthy!</p>
      <p>Things got intense as Federer got into the feel and took the posing up a notch. Some of these angles included him posing as if he was serving in a match and some seemed as if he was right in the middle of a game.</p>
      <p>While his expressions proved that he was enjoying posing for the camera, it was the reaction of the audience that stole the show. Even the comments on the Twitter thread are on the same tune as the audience in the court. Have a look.</p>
