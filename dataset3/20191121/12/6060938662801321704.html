But with an outstanding year with releases like 'Kesari', 'Mission Mangal' and 'Housefull 4' doing excellent business at the box office, Akshay is all set to create a historical box office record.</p>
      <p>With 'Kesari' which released in March this year minting Rs 203 crore, Akshay's box office business graph was off to a good start.

The film went on to collect a total of Rs 277 crore and took Akshay's total collection to a total of Rs 480 crore in the first half of the year itself.</p>
