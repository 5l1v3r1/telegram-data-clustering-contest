      <h1>'We should be afraid of it': WHO chief's warning over global flu pandemic threat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:51:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/anne-gulland/" target="_blank">Anne Gulland</a></address>
      <p>Countries are investing heavily in defence but missing the real enemy – a deadly flu virus, the leader of the World Health Organization has warned. </p>
      <p>In an interview with the <i>Telegraph</i> Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the WHO, said the one thing that worried him more than anything was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/world-not-prepared-global-flu-pandemic-experts-warn/">the threat of a flu outbreak racing around the world</a>. </p>
      <p>“If pandemic flu starts like we had 100 years ago, with the level of connectedness we have now cases could travel within hours from one corner to the other. And imagine the level of destruction we could have. Pandemic flu actually worries me all the time.</p>
      <p>“If you ask me one thing – that’s what scares me. As a world we should be afraid of it,” he said.</p>
      <p>But he said that countries were “investing in panic”, for example spending billions of dollars on the 2014-15 West Africa outbreak, rather than investing in preparedness and disease surveillance.</p>
      <p>Dr Tedros said it was not a matter of if but <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/countries-not-ready-deal-next-disease-outbreak/">when a pandemic strikes</a> and he added: “And it’s not just the health impact, it will have social, economic and political impact.”</p>
      <p>WHO set up a division focused on <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/uk-renews-commitment-fund-pandemic-preparedness/">pandemic preparedness</a> earlier this year and in March will host a conference bringing together the ministers of health, finance and foreign affairs as well as  parliamentarians from vulnerable countries in the Middle East and Africa.</p>
      <p>This will be the first time ministers from these three departments will meet to discuss health security, he said. </p>
      <p>“Preparedness should not be the responsibility of just the health service. The foreign ministers are very relevant because there are cross-border issues. Finance ministers are important, parliamentarians are important,” he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Tedros vowed to be “more aggressive” with world leaders, highlighting the importance of preparedness.</p>
      <p>“Wherever you go a lot of countries invest a lot of money in defence but not a fraction in preparedness for the real enemy – the virus,” he added. </p>
      <p>The current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is finally showing signs of slowing down after nearly 18 months, has sparked its neighbours into action, said Dr Tedros. </p>
      <p>“Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan and others in the neighbourhood are investing in preparedness – because Ebola is next door they are doing it with a sense of urgency. And in six to eight months their preparedness in areas such as disease surveillance has improved significantly,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said richer countries must do more to help poorer ones and he even mooted the possibility of a funding mechanism to which they and donors could contribute. </p>
      <p>“Maybe having a new instrument would bring money but more than the money the most important thing is do we understand the gravity of the problem? Do we understand the magnitude of its impact if pandemic flu strikes?</p>
      <p>“Do we know this could be a more serious problem than a terrorist attack? If we understand that we would have the political commitment. If we have the political commitment then that will help you to mobilise resources and money,” he said.  </p>
      <p>Dr Tedros also warned that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/congos-14-month-ebola-outbreak-finally-nearing-end/">the slowing Ebola outbreak in DRC</a> could easily ramp up again because of the ongoing violence in the area. </p>
      <p>There are currently no more than two new cases of the disease a day, compared to more than 120 when the outbreak was at its peak earlier in the year. </p>
      <p>On the day he spoke to the <i>Telegraph</i> around 14 civilians were killed by local militia in Beni, a town at the heart of the outbreak.</p>
      <p>“The outbreak is winding down and it’s real – we’re happy as this comes after a big big push. But at the same time it’s not over til it’s over. Even one case could spark fire,” he said. </p>
      <p>“Beni is one of the areas where we still get cases – and this could affect our operations and that’s the worry I have,” he said. </p>
      <p>He said responders had learned the “hard way” how to respond to an outbreak when faced with violence from both armed groups and a mistrustful community. </p>
      <p>The community was particularly angry when <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/terror-and-security/joseph-kabila-defends-delaying-vote-ebola-hit-regions-congo/">politicians used Ebola as a pretext for cancelling elections</a> in the area at the end of last year. </p>
      <p>“When an outbreak overlaps with elections it becomes politicised and politicians use it for their own advantage. What does Ebola look like when it happens in an area where there is insecurity? What does it look like in an area where there is chronic political instability? </p>
      <p>“All these were lessons we had to learn the hard way. Some partners left and did not come back,” he said.</p>
