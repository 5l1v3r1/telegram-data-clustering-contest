      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd">Bitcoin</a> plunged below $US8,000 on Thursday, hitting its lowest level in nearly a month.</p>
      <p>The biggest cryptocurrency has dropped for seven straight days as investors have funneled money into mainstream assets.</p>
      <p>“Volumes are low, no new money is coming into the ecosystem, and stocks/bonds/gold are all up double-digits year-to-date, which makes the non-crypto world lose focus on this emerging asset class,” Jeff Dorman, the head of investment at asset manager Arca, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/bitcoin-drops-below-8-000-as-sell-off-drags-into-seventh-day">told Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>“The downward pressure is being caused by a divergence of investment strategy across all asset classes, which has created indecision and cautiousness,” Luno CEO Marcus Swanepoel wrote in a note earlier this week.</p>
      <p>Mainstream rejection of cryptocurrencies could also be fuelling the sell-off. Chinese regulators are cracking down on companies trading digital currencies, and Chinese social-media giant Weibo banned crypto giants Binance and Tron, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/binance-tron-comment-on-weibo-bans-amid-china-crypto-crackdown">according to Bloomberg</a>.</p>
      <p>PayPal’s former president and tech investor Roelof Botha said Bank of America <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-paypal-cfo-roelof-botha-bank-of-america-shut-account-2019-11-1028700108">closed his account with</a> “<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/bitcoin-paypal-cfo-roelof-botha-bank-of-america-shut-account-2019-11-1028700108">absolutely no explanation</a>,” sparking conspiracies he was banned for trading cryptocurrencies. Moreover, R3 CEO David Rutter reportedly said Facebook’s rollout of its Libra digital coin was “<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/facebook-libra-launch-ridiculously-stupid-r3-blockchain-david-rutter-2019-11-1028707191">ridiculously stupid</a>.”</p>
      <p>Bitcoin was down about 2.5% at $US7,900 at the time of writing – a sharp decline from the $US13,000 mark it hit in late June, and a fraction of its all-time high of around $US20,000.</p>
