      <p>KOLKATA: Former captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Dilip-Vengsarkar">Dilip Vengsarkar</a> on Thursday hailed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sourav-Ganguly">Sourav Ganguly</a>, saying the first Pink Ball Test in India is a feather in the BCCI president's cap as he was the man behind making it happen.</p>
      <p>"A cricketing background always helps any administrator to take the right decisions. He has been a very good cricketer, hence, itâ€™s a right decision as an administrator. The first Pink Ball Test in India is happening under his leadership which is another feather in his cap," Vengsarkar said at a promotional event.</p>
      <p>India were apprehensive about playing a pink-ball Test and even refused one at Adelaide against Australia last year. But after becoming the BCCI president, Ganguly emphasised on the issue. He said it took captain <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a> only three seconds to agree to it.</p>
      <p>India will take on Bangladesh at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Eden-Gardens">Eden Gardens</a> on Friday, which is the second Test of the series. The rampaging hosts won the first rubber by an innings and 130 runs.</p>
      <p>"We will have to wait and see," Vengsarkar said about pink-ball Test's future.</p>
      <p>"It is happening at one of the best grounds in India -- Eden. I scored my first hundred here which I remember vividly. As a captain, I also scored a hundred against West Indies. It is one of my favourite grounds. I am sure it will be a success. I hope it brings more people to the grounds. The timing is very good. Those who work can also come and watch. In Australia, it was a huge success," the 63-year-old added.</p>
      <p>"It's a good innovation. One day cricket came in the 70s and then T20s came with the 2007 World Cup. Now we have T10 as well," he concluded.</p>
