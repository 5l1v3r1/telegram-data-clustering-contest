      <p>Territorial Bancorp Inc. declared today a special cash dividend of 50 cents a share that will be payable on Dec. 18 to shareholders of record as of Dec. 4.</p>
      <p>The parent company of the state’s fifth-largest bank, Territorial Savings Bank, last month declared its regular quarterly dividend of 23 cents a share that is payable Thursday.</p>
      <p>“We have had some one-time gains this year that put us ahead of the earnings we had for the first 3 quarters of 2018,” Territorial Chairman and CEO Allan Kitagawa said in a statement. “We believe our capital levels are sufficient to permit us to declare our second special dividend for the year while still allowing us to execute our business plan.”</p>
      <p>Kitagawa also said the company will continue its stock repurchase plan “at a price that makes financial sense for our shareholders” and said the board of directors will continue evaluating all avenues to enhance long-term shareholder returns.</p>
      <p>“Including this special dividend and other dividends paid in 2019, stock purchased in our initial public offering at $10 per share will earn dividends equal to 14.9% of their initial investment in Territorial Bancorp Inc.,” Kitagawa said.</p>
      <p>Territorial announced the special dividend after the market closed. The bank’s stock fell 32 cents to $30.62 during the regular trading session.</p>
