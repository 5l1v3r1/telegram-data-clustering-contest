      <h1>First ‘Borderlands 3’ DLC Hits December 19th</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:46:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/theaxegrinder/" target="_blank">Mike Wilson</a></address>
      <p><b><i>Borderlands 3</i></b> (<a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3585063/borderlands-3-review/">read our review here</a>) is getting its first post-launch in the form of “Moxxi’s Heist of the Handsome Jackpot” campaign. The DLC will launch on December 19, and is included with the Season Pass.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/handsomejackpot/">official site</a>, the DLC has Moxxi assembling a crew (of which you’re a member) to plunder a derelict space station casino known as The Handsome Jackpot. You’ll have to battle your way through Hyperion security forces and crazed casino-goers to reach a safe loaded with Eridium, cash, and all-new Legendary loot.</p>
      <p>To reach The Handsome Jackpot, you need to have played enough of the <i>Borderlands 3</i> story to have access to Sanctuary III. The enemies and loot aboard the station will scale to your Vault Hunter’s level. For rewards, you’ll have access to customization items such as the Vault Hunter Heads &amp; Skins, Weapon Trinkets, an ECHO Device Skin, and new Emotes.</p>
      <p><i>Borderlands 3</i> is available now for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
