      <p>NEW DELHI: Gearing up for his 12th professional bout in four years, Indian boxing star <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/vijender-singh">Vijender Singh</a> on Thursday said he is content with his progress in the circuit despite the fight schedule not being particularly busy.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old, who is undefeated so far, will square off against Ghana's two-time former Commonwealth super middle-weight (76kg) champion <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Charles-Adamu">Charles Adamu</a> in Dubai on Friday.</p>
      <p>Adamu is eight years older than him.</p>
      <p>"I don't expect him to put up too much of a challenge because I have noticed he is slower than me. So, despite his experience, I think I will have the edge," Vijender told PTI from Dubai on the eve of the 10-round clash.</p>
      <p>"So I am relaxed, nothing to worry there," he added.</p>
      <p>Adamu comes into the contest with an experience of 47 bouts, of which he has won 33 (26 knockouts). The Ghanian is also an Olympian and won a bronze medal for his country in the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
      <p>Given that he wasn't particularly worried about how things might pan out on Friday, Vijender spoke of his future plans.</p>
      <p>"I will probably be fighting in India next and people can expect that to be a big one. Obviously I can't give out the full details for now," he said.</p>
      <p>His most recent fight was in July, when he made his debut in the USA after being signed by Hall of Famer <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bob-Arum">Bob Arum</a>'s Top Rank Promotions. He didn't compete at all in 2018 and his last appearance in front of the home fans was back in December 2017 in Jaipur.</p>
      <p>"Once in five-six months suits me just fine because I also need to spend time with my family. It's already been two months since I have been with my wife and children and it is difficult for me to manage beyond that," said the former Olympic bronze-medallist.</p>
      <p>The six-footer from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/haryana">Haryana</a> also said that he would be fighting in the US too but before all that is Friday's showdown, the one for which he has prepared by sparring a little bit more than usual.</p>
      <p>"I have actually taken quite a beating during those sessions. Hopefully, that would mean lesser work when I compete because I will be already battle-hardened," he quipped.</p>
