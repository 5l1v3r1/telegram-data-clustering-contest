      <p>PM Modi said the prime objective of the Central government is to make evidence-based policy-making an integral part of governance by 2022.</p>
      <p>“Our aim is to make evidence-based policy-making an integral part of governance by the year 2022. It will also help in creating a new identity of New India. So is the right phase for the transformation of the audit and assurance sector. Now CAG also has to move towards CAG 2.0,” PM Modi was quoted as saying by ANI.</p>
      <p>Saying that the country is moving towards becoming an economic power of 5 trillion dollars, PM Modi said the role of the CAGs is also important in that. “Because what you do will directly affect the efficiency of the government, the decision-making and the policymaking of the government,” he added.</p>
      <p>As part of the event, he unveiled the statue of Mahatma Gandhi ahead of his speech.</p>

      <p>With the theme ‘Transforming Audit and Assurance in a Digital World’, the conclave is being held to consolidate experience and learning, and chart out the path of the Indian Audit and Accounts Department for the next few years.</p>
      <p>“Panel discussions and group discussions are to be held to discuss ways to transform the department into a technology-led organisation, given how Government is increasingly being data-driven in today’s fast-changing policy and governance environment,” a statement from the PMO said.</p>
      <p>“Efforts are also on to institutionalize knowledge base, leverage IT-based platform to curate knowledge resources and develop anytime, anywhere learning and IT-based toolkits for auditors. In the last few years the Indian Audit and Accounts Department has moved towards transforming audit to meet challenges in the new age, technology-driven India,” the statement read.</p>
