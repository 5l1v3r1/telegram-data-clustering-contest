      <p>Another day, another impeachment testimony to add to the mounting piles of evidence.</p>
      <p>Taking the stand on Wednesday was U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, who was quick to confirm a quid pro quo before mentioning the names of a number of other senior officials who were apparently aware of the situation — including Mike Pence. Yeah, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/sondland-impeachment-hearing-opening-statement-reactions/">it set the internet on fire</a>.</p>
      <p>"The vice president nodded, like, you know, he heard what I said," said Sondland, describing a meeting where he'd spoken openly about Ukraine in Pence's presence.</p>
      <p>"Now keep in mind nodding is the biggest movement Mike Pence can make," responded Colbert on Wednesday night's <i>The Late Show</i>. "If he moves his body any more than that the devil will accuse him of dancing — and Mother will not be pleased."</p>
      <p>Colbert then played a clip of Sondland rattling off the names of all the other officials who were "in the loop."</p>
      <p>"I'd also like to incriminate my agent, baby doll I love you," yelled Colbert, parodying Sondland. "[...] everybody at the RNC, Mick Mulvaney, we couldn't have suppressed Ukraine without you, oh God they're playing me off, I want to thank the whistleblower..."</p>
      <p>And with that he dragged himself off, stage right.</p>
