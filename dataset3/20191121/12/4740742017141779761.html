        <figcaption>Broadmead, 1952. Bruton’s piano shop has a sale on “due to compulsory relocation”. The same view today is towards the circular area in the middle of the shopping area, and the site of these shops is now that of two phone shops and a branch of Ann Summers.<cite>(Image: Bristol Post)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>This spot is nowadays on the edge of Castle Park, facing the entrance to the Galleries car park. The building, or the lower half of it anyway, is occupied by Salanson &amp; Co, a photographic shop and optician. The premises were previously occupied by photographer Fred Little. Before that, this impressive building was St Peter’s School, though we don’t know when it closed. By 1937 it was also the parish hall for the nearby St Peter’s Church, which of course was lost in the Blitz.<cite>(Image: Bristol Post)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>Broadmead,1954. Fred Morgan’s furniture shop would soon be demolished to make way for one of the earliest stages in the new development. The buildings to the right of the picture are now part of the Galleries complex and the entrance to the Greyhound pub is just out of view on the right.<cite>(Image: Bristol Post)</cite></figcaption>

        <figcaption>Penn Street being laid out, 1957. The gaps in the buildings are due to enemy action, and demolition men would do the rest. The Whitefield Tabernacle, dating back to 1753, would not survive for long after its 200th birthday. The same view nowadays would be of the northern side of Penn Street, looking at a big Cabot Circus fashion shop.<cite>(Image: Bristol Post)</cite></figcaption>
