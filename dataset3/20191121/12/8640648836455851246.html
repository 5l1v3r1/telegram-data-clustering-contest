      <p>After a rainy Wednesday, residents will encounter cool temperatures for a few days.</p>
      <p>Early Thursday the National Weather Service canceled the winter storm warning for the Sheep Range, Spring Mountains and Red Rock Canyon that was to have been in effect until 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>“There may be some more flurries, but it won’t amount to much,” weather service meteorologist Alex Boothes said.</p>
      <p>The Las Vegas Valley could receive some rain before 2 p.m. Thursday. The forecast has party cloudy skies and a high near 52 degrees with light easterly winds becoming calm later in the morning.</p>
      <p>Thursday night lows will be near 46 with light winds and partly cloudy skies.</p>
      <p>Friday’s high will rise to 60 with light northeast winds and sunny skies.</p>
      <p>The weekend calls for sunny skies and highs in the low 60s, which is the norm for late November.</p>
