      <p>A lentil stew is hearty and wholesome, especially in winter. This one-pot recipe is perfect to cut down on washing up, and it can have dinner on the table in an hour. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 50 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>Four</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>200g cooking chorizo, cut into 1cm slices</li>
        <li>2 large white onions, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 stick of celery, finely chopped </li>
        <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and chopped </li>
        <li>1 red chilli, deseeded and finely chopped </li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped </li>
        <li>250g Puy lentils </li>
        <li>2 bay leaves </li>
        <li>½ small bunch of thyme, leaves picked </li>
        <li>1 tsp sweet smoked paprika, plus extra, to serve </li>
        <li>1 litre hot chicken stock or water </li>
        <li>250g spinach, washed and drained </li>
        <li>A squeeze of lemon </li>
        <li>2 handfuls of parsley leaves, finely chopped </li>
        <li>4 tbsp crème fraîche, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep saucepan over a medium-low heat. Add the chorizo and gently fry for a few minutes until it begins to colour and release some of its fat. Scoop out of the pan and put to one side for a moment.</li>
        <li>Add the onions, celery, pepper, chilli, garlic and a good pinch of salt to the pan. Fry gently for 20 minutes until sweet and slightly coloured, adding more oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lentils, bay leaves, thyme and paprika and mix well so the lentils are nicely coated. Pour over the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer for 20-25 minutes until the lentils are cooked through. It should be the texture of a thick stew.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach and the cooked chorizo, fold through the lentils and continue to cook until the spinach just begins to wilt. Add a squeeze of lemon to give it a kick, then season to taste and stir through the parsley.</li>
        <li>Transfer to warmed bowls, dollop over crème fraîche and give each bowl a dusting with paprika. Serve with some crusty bread.</li>
