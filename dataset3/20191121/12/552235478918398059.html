      <p>A chipboard production plant has won a prestigious award for its investment in apprenticeships.</p>
      <p>Egger Barony have swooped the SME Apprentice Employer of the Year at the Scottish Apprenticeship Awards 2019.</p>
      <p>The Auchinleck employer currently has 22 apprentices in its 148 strong workforce – and that number is expected to grow.</p>
      <p>The firm believes apprenticeships have provided them with the ideal way to address an ageing workforce, while helping youngsters start their careers.</p>
      <p>The plant expects to lose 70 per cent of its staff over the next ten years primarily through retirement, leading to a focus on training the next generation of talent.</p>
      <p>Production and Technical Director Heiko Lichtblau said: “I’m absolutely overwhelmed. We didn’t expect to be shortlisted so to win the award is just amazing.</p>

      <p>“It’s all about bringing in fresh blood. It’s a delight to work with the young guys and they push up the older workforce too.</p>
      <p>“Older colleagues pass on their experience and knowledge, but the young ones also push the more experienced guys further.</p>
      <p>“There is a skills shortage in the area we operate. We see this not only as investing in people but investing in the region.”</p>
      <p>Chair of Skills Development Scotland, Frank Mitchell, added: “More than ever, employers are recognising the benefits of investing in skills and apprenticeships.</p>
      <p>“Egger is a great example of businesses developing a strong and resilient workforce for the future through apprenticeships.”</p>
