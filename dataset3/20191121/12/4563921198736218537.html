      <p>Authors: Tridivesh Singh Maini &amp; Mahitha Lingala*</p>
      <p>The Sri Lankan election result, was closely observed, not just for its likely impact on domestic politics in Sri Lanka, but it’s impact on geopolitical dynamics in South Asia. Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Former Defence Secretary, and brother of former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa,  won by a massive margin, defeating his opponent Sajith Premadasa (son of a former President who was assassinated in 1993). He was sworn in on Monday, November 18, 2019 as President.</p>
      <p>While Rajapaksa, the candidate of the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/tag/398-244/sri-lanka/?utm=bodytag">Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Party)</a> polled over<a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gotabaya-rajapaksa-wins-sri-lankan-presidential-election-official-results/article29998767.ece">52%</a> of the vote, the runner up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajith_Premadasa">Sajith Premadasa</a> of the United National Party (UNP)polled 42% of the votes. It is pertinent to note, that the UNP did much better in <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gotabaya-rajapaksa-wins-sri-lankan-presidential-election-official-results/article29998767.ece">North Eastern districts</a> of the South Asian country, which are <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gotabaya-rajapaksa-wins-sri-lankan-presidential-election-official-results/article29998767.ece">dominated by Muslims and Tamils.</a></p>
      <p>Analysts believe, that the triumph of the former Defense Secretary, is likely to result in <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/world/in-first-steps-after-coming-to-power-sri-lankas-rajapaksa-clan-likely-to-re-boot-china-ties-2392081.html">Sri Lanka</a>moving closer to China – as was the case during Mahindra Rajapaksa’s term (which ended in 2015, Rajapaksa lost to Maithripali Sirisena, the latter had served in Rajapaksa’s government but in  <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/how-lankan-president-maithripala-sirisena-fell-into-the-trap-laid-by-mahinda-rajapaksa/articleshow/66409411.cms?from=mdr">2014</a> he decided to part ways and was the Presidential candidate of the opposition).There is a belief however, that Gotabaya Rajapaksa, may not veer as much towards China, as his brother given the changing ground realities.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sri Lanka’s tilt towards China during Mahindra Rajapaksa’s tenure</b>
      </p>
      <p>During Mahindra Rajakapsa’s tenure, Sri Lanka took a turn towards China, much to the chagrin of India. While one of the reasons cited for the same, was China’s economic prowess, and ability to deliver fast on key infrastructure politics. It would be pertinent to point out, that there was an equally, if not more important reasons for the Former President warming upto China –Beijing turned a <a href="https://qz.com/1317234/chinas-debt-trap-in-sri-lanka-is-even-worse-than-we-thought/">blind eye</a> to the Human Rights violations (an estimated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/17/the-terminator-how-gotabaya-rajapaksas-ruthless-streak-led-him-to-power-sri-lanka">40,000 Tamils</a> – which included journalists and opponents) were killed in operations against Tamil separatists)</p>
      <p> New Delhi-Colombo ties also took a hit, during Rajapaksa’s tenure, due to the opposition of regional parties – AIADMK (All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) and DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) — from the Southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Political parties from Tamil Nadu  have been constantly alleging Sri Lankan govt failed to follow their 13<sup>th</sup> amendment (which sought to provide devolution to the Tamil Community and reduce the harmony with the community) and also allege, that many innocent civilians were killed during the war for which Mahinda Rajapaksa must be held accountable. The previous Congress led UPA (United Progressive Alliance) government voted against Sri Lanka in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-abstains-from-voting-on-unhrc-resolution-against-sri-lanka/articleshow/32797546.cms?from=mdr">2009, 2012 and 2013,</a> supporting a US passed resolution against Sri Lanka at the UN. In 2014, India made a slight change to it’s approach and rather than voting directly against Sri Lanka, New Delhi <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/abstention-louder-than-any-vote/article5851821.ece">abstained from voting against Sri Lanka</a>. In 2013, Indian PM Dr. Manmohan Singh due to pressure from Tamil Nadu’s regional parties <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2496233/Manmohan-Singh-decides-skip-Commonwealth-meeting-Sri-Lanka.html">did not attend the Common Wealth Head of Government Meeting (CHOGM) meeting in Colombo.</a></p>
      <p>In 2015,  when Mahinda Rajapaksa lost elections, Tamilian parties including the BJP TN unit in India <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/politics/rajapaksa-s-defeat-is-victory-of-tamil-people-say-tn-parties-115010900408_1.html">termed it as a victory of the Sri Lankan Tamils</a>. Indian PM, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/mahinda-rajapaksa-thanks-modi-for-inviting-on-swearing-in-ceremony/articleshow/35508262.cms?from=mdr">Narendra Modi</a> had invited Mahindra Rajapaksa for his swearing in as PM in 2014 and also congratulated <a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pm-modi-congratulates-gotabaya-rajapaksa-for-winning-sri-lankan-polls-invites-to-visit-india-1619906-2019-11-17">Gotabaya</a> Rajapaksa. Modi also invited the newly elected President to visit India. The new President is likely to visit India on <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gotabaya-rajapaksa-to-visit-new-delhi-on-november-29/article30018871.ece">November 29, 2019.</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>Economic tilt towards China under Mahindra Rajapaksa</b>
      </p>
      <p>Colombo’s economic tilt to Beijing, was strongly reiterated by the Hambantota Port project, which was handed over to China, and given on lease for 99 years. The port was built with 85% of the funds coming from Exim Bank in China. After money shortage in 2017 in regard to this loan, Sri Lankan government handed over the port and <a href="http://www.ft.lk/special-report/How-China-got-Sri-Lanka-to-cough-up-a-port/22-657943">15,000 acres of associated land to China Merchants Port Holdings for 99 years</a>. This was cited, as one of the strong instances of China’s ‘Debt Trap’ Diplomacy. US drew attention to this, and so did a report by the Centre for Global <a href="https://qz.com/1317234/chinas-debt-trap-in-sri-lanka-is-even-worse-than-we-thought/">Development (CGD)</a>but Sri Lanka has <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3007175/sri-lanka-rejects-fears-chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy-belt-and">rejected this fear</a> while admitting that the debt pressure is huge.</p>
      <p>China remains one of Sri Lanka’s largest creditors accounting for an <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3007175/sri-lanka-rejects-fears-chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy-belt-and">estimated 10% of its total foreign debt</a>. China is investing in large infrastructural projects through its flagship programme  the Belt and Road Initiative(BRI) in Sri Lanka, some of the major ones include; <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3007175/sri-lanka-rejects-fears-chinas-debt-trap-diplomacy-belt-and">Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, Mahinda Rajapaksa International Cricket Stadium, and the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port in southern Sri Lanka</a>. Another project which has proven to be controversial is the <a href="http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Sirisena:-Lotus-Tower-money-gone-to-China-48064.html">Lotus Tower</a>. The 17 story structure – South Asia’s tallest self supporting structure – has been criticised not just for the fact that it represented a wrong utilisation of resources, but the company which had the contract for building the tower was accused of <a href="http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Sirisena:-Lotus-Tower-money-gone-to-China-48064.html">misappropriating funds</a> (a whopping 11 Million USD) by former President Maithrapali Sirisena.</p>
      <p>Mahindra Rajapaksa’s close ties to China were also evident in the <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/world/in-first-steps-after-coming-to-power-sri-lankas-rajapaksa-clan-likely-to-re-boot-china-ties-2392081.html">strategic sphere</a> (two <a href="https://www.news18.com/news/world/in-first-steps-after-coming-to-power-sri-lankas-rajapaksa-clan-likely-to-re-boot-china-ties-2392081.html">Chinese</a> submarines docked in the South Asian Island nation in 2014)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Balancing of relationships</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rajapaksa’s successor, Maithripali Sirisena did try to balance out relationships, and reduce the South Asian country’s dependence upon China, but was unable to do so. President Sirisena said that he would <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30743787">treat major Asian countries equally</a>. India and Sri Lanka in February 2015 <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-sri-lanka-ink-civil-nuclear-pact-agree-to-expand-defence-ties/articleshow/46263246.cms?from=mdr">signed a nuclear pact</a> to improve relationships and agreed to improve defence ties.</p>
      <p>A number of important projects were taken over by Japan, and there have also been some strong instances of <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/sri-lanka-signs-port-deal-with-india-japan/articleshow/69547981.cms?from=mdr">India-Japan</a> working together in Sri Lanka. <a href="https://japan-forward.com/japan-and-india-to-jointly-develop-sri-lankas-east-container-terminal-port/">India, Japan and Sri Lanka</a> have signed an agreement to develop the East Container Terminal (ECT) of Colombo Port. While <a href="https://japan-forward.com/japan-and-india-to-jointly-develop-sri-lankas-east-container-terminal-port/">India and Japan will retain 49% stake in this project, while Sri Lanka will have 51%</a> (work on the project will begin in March 2020). </p>
      <p>This investment has been seen as a joint effort by India- Japan to counterbalance China’s growing influence in the Indian Ocean region. Apart from this project, both India and Japan have also been working on an <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/petronet-japanese-company-to-set-up-300-million-lng-terminal-in-sri-lanka/articleshow/62871145.cms?from=mdr">LNG project terminal near Colombo</a>.  India’s Petronet LNG (one of the country’s energy giants) will have a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/oil-gas/petronet-japanese-company-to-set-up-300-million-lng-terminal-in-sri-lanka/articleshow/62871145.cms?from=mdr">47.5% stake in the project, while Japan’s Mitsubishi and Sojitzcorp will have a 37.5% stake)</a></p>
      <p>
        <b>US has also been trying to make Sri Lanka part of the Indo-Pacific narrative.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The US has also begun to pay more attention to Sri Lanka, especially in the context of being an important stakeholder in the US vision for a ‘Free and Open Indo Pacific’.</p>
      <p>US Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale, and Sri Lankan Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana held the third US-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue in Washington DC in May 2019. Both sides, according to a joint statement issued after the dialogue, resolved to work together for a<a href="http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/69384593.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst">“a safe maritime domain in the Indian and Pacific oceans through a rules-based order that ensures respect for international laws and norms” </a>. Furthermore, after the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka also became a <a href="https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/sri-lanka-test-case-the-free-and-open-indo-pacific-strategy">Logistics hub</a> for the US Navy in the Indian Ocean</p>
      <p>
        <b>Domestic Politics</b>
      </p>
      <p>It is not just geo-politics, even in the context of Sri Lankan politics, it remains to be seen what approach he takes towards Muslims and Tamils. The electoral verdict is polarized. On his part, the newly elected President, did <a href="https://www.wionews.com/south-asia/its-my-duty-to-serve-all-sri-lankans-without-race-religious-discrimination-says-newly-elected-president-gotabaya-rajapaksa-262769">state</a> that</p>
      <p>
        <i>“I am conscious that I am also the president of those who used the vote against me…. “It is my duty to serve all Sri Lankans without race or religious discrimination. I promise to discharge my duties in a fair manner’</i>
      </p>
      <p>Conclusion</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it remains to be seen whether there will be a drastic change in both domestic policies, as well as Sri Lanka’s foreign policy orientation. While, Sri Lanka is dependent upon China, in the economic sphere, it is important to acknowledge the fact, that there have been a number of economic and geo-political changes in recent years. First, China’s economy has witnessed a slowdown, and Beijing will be unable to assist Sri Lanka to the degree it did earlier – though it’s overall economic influence could grow. Second, US has been paying attention to Sri Lanka, due to it’s strategic importance especially in the context of Indo-Pacific, as was mentioned earlier. In this context, it is likely that US, Japan and India could work jointly in Sri Lanka  (Japan and India have already initiated some projects) .The new Sri Lankan President would do well to pay attention to the fact, that South Asian countries like Bangladesh have been able to balance ties and not remained solely dependent upon China.</p>
      <p> Finally, the US reaction to the election, and the warning with regard to Human Rights is significant. The outside world, is likely to keep a close watch on Sri Lanka, and it is likely, that the new President while upgrading economic ties with China will do a balancing act, so that Colombo is not totally dependent upon China.</p>
