      <h1>DNA test shows Hunter Biden fathered child with Arkansas woman who is now suing for support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:12:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:12</time> by <a rel="author">New York Post, The Daily Telegraph</a></address>
      <p>A DNA test has revealed that Hunter Biden fathered a child with an Arkansas woman, according to court papers released on Wednesday local time. </p>
      <p>The test established Biden’s paternity with “scientific certainty,” the child’s mother, Lunden Alexis Roberts, said in in a motion posted online by the <i>Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</i>.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/20/dna-test-shows-hunter-biden-fathered-child-with-arkansas-woman-report/?_ga=2.238374920.985909713.1574074602-1318596157.1515598658"><i>New York Post</i></a>'s Page Six, Biden, son of US Democratic presidential candidate and former US Vice President Joe Biden, has denied having had sex with Roberts and agreed to the test last month in a bid to prove he didn’t father her unidentified child.</p>

      <p>He’s “not expected to challenge the results of the DNA test or the testing process,” according to Roberts’ filing in Arkansas’ Independence County Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Roberts’ child was born in August 2018, while Hunter was in a relationship with Hallie Biden, the widow of his late older brother Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015. </p>
      <p>The onetime in-laws began dating in 2017 but broke up in April, Page Six exclusively reported at the time.</p>
      <p>Roberts filed her paternity suit in May, about two weeks after Hunter, 49, married Melissa Cohen, 33, following a whirlwind, six-day romance.</p>

      <p>Hunter is currently embroiled in the impeachment inquiry against US President Trump, based on allegations that Mr Trump withheld nearly $400 million ($A588 million) in military aid to Ukraine in part to try to force an investigation of his reported $50,000-a-month job ($A73,000) with the Burisma natural gas company.</p>
      <p>Republican politicians want him to testify before the House Intelligence Committee, but Chairman Adam Schiff (Democrat, California) rejected that request earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Hunter, who has three adult daughters from his first marriage, has a history of drug and alcohol problems that got him booted from the US Navy Reserve for cocaine use in 2014 and sent him to rehab several times.</p>
      <p>In 2015, following the release of information hacked from the Ashley Madison website – which caters to people seeking to have extramarital affairs – he claimed an account with his email address was “set up by someone else without my knowledge.”</p>
      <p>In her motion on Wednesday, local time, Roberts seeks to have her the name, date of birth and “all other identifying information” of her child – who’s called “Baby Doe” – sealed from the public when the court issues a paternity order.</p>

      <p>Roberts’ filing notes that “members of the Biden family either are protected or eligible to be protected by the United States Secret Service as a direct result of Joe Biden’s political status” and that “Baby Doe’s paternity could put the child and those close to the child at risk of harm.”</p>
      <p>A related motion seeks more than $11,000 ($A16,000) in attorney’s fees and court costs from Hunter.</p>
      <p>Hunter’s lawyers, who include former Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.</p>
