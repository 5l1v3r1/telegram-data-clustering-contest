      <p>Tonight (November 21) we are streaming <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/machine-head/">Machine Head</a>’s knockout performance in The K! Pit, in association with Rizla. A super-intimate one-hour performance from one of the biggest metal bands of all time that we will never ever forget, and you can watch the whole thing for free.</p>
      <p>But it wasn’t just a night of iron-cast heavy metal bangers, Robb was in full storytelling mode, regaling the London audience of how their iconic track Davidian came to be – and its original chorus.</p>
      <p>While we all love bellowing out <i>‘Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast’</i> nowadays, the first incarnation wasn’t quite as menacing or cool. Or, as Robb says, it’s “fucking horrible.”</p>
      <p>

      <p>“Logan (Mader, guitarist) came up with the intro riff and I had this other riff that went good with it (sic), which is a total Exodus ripoff, but I was like ‘Fuck it, I’m gonna put some double-bass on that shit and make it sound <i>nothing</i> like Exodus,’” says Robb.</p>
      <p>“We started jamming it, and a lot of the time when I write lyrics I just freestyle, I don’t have anything set, I don’t write down stuff first I just see what comes. I make up words and look around like, ‘PAs! Spines! Blood! People!’ whatever comes in my mind.</p>
      <p>“For some very bizarre reason… the very first chorus of Davidian was ‘Get the fuck up to the bone-breaking groove.’ And I thought that was good! I thought that was good for like three weeks. Then I remember we did a warehouse party – when we started out there wasn’t a lot of clubs in the Bay Area, and we were just playing our punk rock friends’ warehouse – we were playing a parking lot.</p>
      <p>“I remember getting up, we were getting to Davidian, we’re gonna do this fuckin’ chorus, I said it one time and I was like, ‘Holy shit! This is fucking horrible.’ In that moment, in that warehouse parking lot… this shit’s gotta change, right fuckin’ now, because this <i>sucks</i>. So that night I wrote, ‘Let freedom ring with a shotgun blast.’”</p>
      <p>So there you have it! Performed live in a Bay Area warehouse, never to be repeated. But if you want to see Davidian in all its glory, blasted out to a capacity crowd of just 50 people, check out Machine Head’s K! Pit set on Kerrang!’s Facebook and YouTube from <b>November 21 at 7:30pm BST/2:30pm EST/11:30am PST</b>.</p>
