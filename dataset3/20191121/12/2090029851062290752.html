      <p>Nigerian artiste, YCee has called out people trying hard to prove they have been supporters of Burna Boy.</p>
      <p>Ycee took to his social media page to inform people that nobody will flog them if they didn’t support Burna Boy so they need to stop going to dig up old posts to prove that they have been supporters.</p>
