      <h1>Joe Marler Gives Bizarre In-House Interview Ahead Of Club Return</h1>

        <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Harlequins">Harlequins</a> got their Heineken Cup campaign off to a difficult start last weekend shipping 53 points in a defeat to Clermont Auvergne.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Premiership outfit face Bath this coming weekend and are bolstered by the return of loosehead prop <a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/smcmahon/joe-marler-envies-irish-rugby-system/">Joe Marler</a>.</p>
      <p>Marler played a pivotal role for England en route to the Rugby World Cup final in Japan less than two years after initially retiring from international rugby.</p>

      <p>As a result of their exploits, Marler and his England teammates were given an extended break and missed last weekend’s opening round of the Champions Cup.</p>
      <p>He’s back this week though as they look to avoid falling behind early in the group to a Bath side who also lost their opening round fixture against Ulster.</p>
      <p>Ahead of the game, the ever-colourful Marler gave an in-house interview that took a strange turn.</p>
      <p>Marler began to talk about him and his teammates ‘getting back on the horse’ this weekend before the hilarious prop veered off on a tangent about horses.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got another week to get back on the horse and take that horse to water and you can ask that horse. You can say, ‘Hey horsey do you want to have a drink or do you want to have a swim.”</p>
