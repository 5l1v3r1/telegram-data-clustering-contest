      <h3>PlayStation 4 vs PlayStation 4 Slim vs PlayStation 4 Pro: Which console should I pick?</h3>
      <p>Picking between these two consoles this late in 2019 oomes down to a couple of basic questions. Why are you buying the console? If it is so that you can play a handful of PlayStation 4 exclusives that you haven't yet and you aren't too concerned with the graphics, then the Slim bundle is probably the way to go. If having the best possible resolution and visuals in a game is an absolute must, you should pick the PlayStation 4 Pro. The regular PlayStation 4 has been discontinued and as such, you shouldn't bother trying to get one of those.</p>
      <h3>Will my current games work on a new console?</h3>
      <p>The PlayStation 4 is not backward compatible with past PlayStation consoles, so PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 games won't run. The only way to play some of these games on your PlayStation 4 is through the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B00ZGG1HZA/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=playstation+now&amp;qid=1574280337&amp;sr=8-3&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82593YYw">PS NOW streaming service</a>, which includes many PS3 games.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, Sony has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/will-every-playstation-4-game-be-backward-compatible-playstation-5">PlayStation 5 will be backward compatible</a> with the PlayStation 4. Your games will carry over and you'll be able to keep on playing them on the next system. Certain games, like Marvel's Spider-Man, will be able to take advantage of the new hardware and perform far better than on the PlayStation 4.</p>
      <h3>What is PlayStation Plus and why do I need it?</h3>
      <p>You'll want a PlayStation Plus membership in order to play games online (bar free-to-play games) but the benefits go far beyond that. PlayStation Plus members get special discounts and a couple of free games per month, as well as cloud save storage, so even if something happens to your console, your saves are backed up, safe in the cloud. PlayStation Plus memberships are going on sale for Black Friday, with 25% off a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=playstation%2Bplus&amp;qid=1574280591&amp;sr=8-2&amp;th=1&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82593YYw">yearly subscription</a>.</p>
      <h3>Will there be any PlayStation accessories on sale?</h3>
      <p>Yes, Black Friday is a great time to grab not just new consoles and games but also different accessories. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualShock-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-Black-4/dp/B01LWVX2RG/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=dualshock+4&amp;qid=1574280200&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82593YYw">DualShock 4 controllers</a> will be $40, which is a $25 discount. For licensed headsets, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Gold-Wireless-Headset-4/dp/B078TCLYVM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=sony+gold&amp;qid=1574280491&amp;sr=8-1&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU82593YYw">PlayStation Gold headset</a> is being discounted to $70, while it is usually $100.
