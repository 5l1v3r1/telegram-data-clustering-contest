      <p>The Kerala government on Thursday announced a judicial probe into the deaths of two Dalit sisters of Walayar after being sexually exploited. The Judicial inquiry would be conducted by former district judge P.K. Haneefa.</p>
      <p>A decision in this regard was taken at the Cabinet meeting on Thursday. Earlier, a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court had acquitted four accused, citing lack of evidence. The accused were said to be close to the ruling CPI(M).</p>
      <p>While the elder girl, aged 13, was found hanging inside their house on January 13, 2017, her nine year-old younger sister died 52 days later in a similar manner. Since the acquittal of the accused, the family had been demanding a CBI probe into the case.</p>
      <p>The State government had filed an appeal in the High court.</p>
