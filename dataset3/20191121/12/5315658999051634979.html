      <h1>Two-timing Iona Pannett creaming it</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:44:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/New_Zealand_Taxpayers'_Union" target="_blank">New Zealand Taxpayers' Union</a></address>
      <p>21 NOVEMBER 2019<br/>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p>
      <p>In the wake of Wellington City Councillors voting for a 28 per cent <a href="https://taxpayers.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c86359d14575615d6ae8c2b60&amp;id=9a2cada7b1&amp;e=e1be0b90d0">increase in their base salaries</a>, the <i>New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union </i>is questioning Iona Pannett’s decision to take a second salary.</p>
      <p><i>Taxpayers’ Union </i>Executive Director Jordan Williams says: “Iona Pannett is engaged in an extraordinary case of double-dipping. She’s paid by ratepayers for the full-time job of being a City Councillor, while also collecting a second sizeable salary as CEO of Birthright NZ.”</p>
      <p>“Ratepayers forking out $111,000 for Cr Pannett’s full-time salary should expect her to be engaged in the role, not moonlighting for 30 hours a week running a nationwide NGO.”</p>
      <p>A Wellington City Councillor is generally expected to work 30-50 hours per week. The <i>Taxpayers’ Union</i> has been informed that Cr Pannett spends around 30 hours as Birthright CEO.</p>
      <p>“To make things worse, Birthright is largely taxpayer-funded, meaning Cr Pannett drinks from two public gravy pots at once.”</p>
      <p>“As for the latest pay hike at Wellington City Council, it casts doubt on the Remuneration Authority’s fiscal sense. If the authority is willing to reward a heavily-indebted council with large pay rises, how can we trust it to determine MP salaries?”</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister gave the Authority the charge of determining MP salaries <a href="https://taxpayers.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c86359d14575615d6ae8c2b60&amp;id=fe49695b67&amp;e=e1be0b90d0">in August</a> this year.</p>
