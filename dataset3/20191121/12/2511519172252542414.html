      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/belgium-football">Belgium</a> have been charged by Uefa after a mix-up saw Dedryck Boyata wear <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/michy-batshuayi">Michy Batshuayi</a>’s shirt.</p>
      <p>The Hertha defender featured in the Euro 2020 qualifier against Russia, but could be seen with ‘Batshuayi’ and ‘23’ on the back of his shirt.</p>
      <p>Boyata was named in the squad as No 4, but appears to have changed into a fresh shirt at half-time and accidentally picked up the wrong change of strip.</p>
      <p>While Boyata wore the wrong shirt in the second half, Belgium’s backroom staff eventually noticed and the switch was made in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea forward joked later on Twitter, posting a picture with the caption: ”happy to have realised this kid’s dream”.</p>

      <p>Uefa have applied a charge based on article 43 (1) of the competition’s regulations, which states: “Before each match, each team shall indicate in the relevant match sheet the numbers, full names, dates of birth and, if applicable, shirt names of the 23 players in the squad.”</p>
      <p>A separate charge has been handed to Belgium for a “delayed kick-off”.</p>
