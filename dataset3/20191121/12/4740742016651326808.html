      <h1>M5 traffic warning as motorway 'sinking' between J9 and J10</h1>
      <h2>The stretch of motorway between Tewkesbury and Cheltenham will be affected today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:44:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:44</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Norris, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Part of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/m5-motorway">M5</a> has been cordoned off this morning for emergency works.</p>
      <p>The sinking carriageway has prompted a lane closure on the southbound carriageway between junction 9 for Tewkesbury and junction 10 for Cheltenham.</p>
      <p>Lane one has been closed whilst emergency repairs take place, <a href="https://www.gloucestershirelive.co.uk/news/gloucester-news/m5-sinking-gloucestershire-subsidence-prompts-3560990">Gloucestershire Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Highways England has confirmed the closure will remain in place all day - and another lane will be closed this evening when the repair takes place.</p>
      <p>Highways England tweeted this morning: "We have lane one closed due to the carriageway subsiding.</p>
      <p>"This is likely to be in place for some time so please allow extra time for your journey throughout peak times this afternoon/evening."</p>
