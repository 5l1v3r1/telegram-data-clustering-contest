      <h1>Why your boss MUST allow you time off if your child's school closes unexpectedly</h1>
      <h2>If your child's school is shut because of a sickness outbreak, what are your rights? Can you stay off work to look after them? We have the answers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:22:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Milligan, Simon Meechan</a></address>
      <p>Around 60 schools across the North East are reporting absences of staff and pupils following an outbreak of a flu-like virus.</p>
      <p>Experts from the Government run Public Health England North East (PHE NE) health protection team have confirmed they have been <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/virus-60-north-east-schools-17292996">working with dozens of schools</a> and local authorities in the region.</p>
      <p>Hundreds of children have been off sick this week in the North East with some schools being forced to close as a result of the high numbers of absentees of both staff and students.</p>
      <p>But what are a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/parenting">parent's</a> rights when their children can not go to school? Are parents allowed time off to look after their children?</p>
      <p>The good news is that the answer appears to be “yes”, according to an employment law expert and Citizens Advice.</p>
      <p>Tony Hyams-Parish, partner at law firm DMH Stallard, clarifies what rights mums and dads have when the school stays shut and the kids have nowhere to go.</p>
      <h3>The law gives employees the right to stay off work and look after their kids to deal with 'unexpected incidents' - this could include school closures</h3>
      <p>Tony Hyams-Parish, Partner at law firm DMH Stallard, said:</p>
      <p>"Section 57A(e) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 allows employees to take a reasonable period of time off to deal with an unexpected incident which involves the employee's child while they are at school (or another educational establishment). School closure due to weather is likely to fall under these rules.</p>
      <p>"As soon as reasonably practicable, the employee must tell the employer of the need to leave work and the reason for this. This should include sufficient information to enable the employer to determine whether the statutory right applies.</p>
      <p>"They must also tell the employer how long they expect to be away from work (unless it is not reasonably practicable). The right is to take a "reasonable" amount of time off to take action which is "necessary", and this will always depend on the circumstances.</p>
      <h3>However, your work does not have to pay you for that time off</h3>
      <p>Tony says your bosses can withhold pay if you stay off work to look after your child when they can not go to school.</p>
      <p>He added: "Although that’s the strict legal position, many employers will be more flexible. They can allow employers to work from home, make time up later or where a longer period is necessary, allow holiday to be taken. Some will allow the time off without any consequence such as deduction of pay."</p>
      <h3>Your employer can not make you come to work if you have no choice but to stay at home and look after your child due to an emergency</h3>
      <p>“In an emergency, you are entitled to take time off to make sure your child is looked after. This is known as dependant leave. Your employer can’t refuse you dependent leave if you have no other choice, and you can’t be disciplined or sacked for taking the time off,” said Tracey Moss, employment expert at Citizens Advice.</p>
      <p>“If your employer won’t give you time off, or has disciplined you for having to look after your child, contact your nearest Citizens Advice for help.”</p>
      <h3>Citizens Advice: What to do if you need time off</h3>
      <p>Speak to your manager - Different employers have different policies. They may allow you to take paid time off, annual leave or to make up the hours later in the week.</p>
      <p>Request parental leave - If you need more than a week off, ask for parental leave. You will have to have been working for your employer for more than a year.</p>
      <p>Request dependant leave - this is for use in emergencies. If your manager refuses, you may have to leave anyway. If they try to discipline or sack you for leaving you can get support from Citizens Advice.</p>
      <h3>What is ‘unpaid parental leave’?</h3>
      <p>Parental leave is a form of unpaid leave that entitles workers to time off to care for their child.</p>
      <p>Each employee is entitled to up to 18 weeks’ leave for each child and adopted child, up to their 5th birthday - or 18th if the child has a disability.</p>
      <p>The limit on how much parental leave each parent can take a year is four weeks.</p>
      <p>You must take parental leave as whole weeks rather than odd days, unless your employer agrees otherwise or your child is disabled.</p>
      <p>Eligible employees can request this type of leave to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Spend more time with their children</li>
        <li>Look at new schools</li>
        <li>Settle children into new childcare arrangements</li>
        <li>Spend more time with family, such as visiting grandparents</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During this period, all of your employment rights will remain protected - such as annual leave entitlement and your right to return to work.</p>
      <p>To qualify, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have worked in the organisation for more than a year</li>
        <li>Have “parental responsibility” for the child, as defined under the Children Act 1989</li>
        <li>Be named on the child’s birth certificate or have obtained formal legal parental responsibilities</li>
      </ul>
