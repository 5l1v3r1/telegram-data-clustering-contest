      <h1>Hearts will be left behind if they continue delay over new manager - Hotline</h1>
      <h2>Fraser Wilson takes your calls as supporters deliver their verdict on the situation in the capital.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:10:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:10</time> by <a rel="author">Sports Hotline, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sports-hotline/</a></address>
      <p>IT’S turning into the million dollar question of Scottish football … just how much is <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> worth?</p>
      <p>Not that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> plan on selling the 22-goal hitman in the near future.</p>
      <p>But his first strike for Colombia on Saturday weighed against his lack of goals versus <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> and a chance wasted for his country last night continue to raise his value on the one hand and drop it on the other.</p>
      <p>No prizes for guessing which set of fans are on which side. But caller Gordon Ashley’s assertion this week that Morelos is worth no more than £7m ensured the subject continues to lead the way on the Hotline.</p>
      <p>First up, <b>Jim McBeth</b> , Glasgow, who argued: “If Morelos is only valued at £7m - £8m, according to Celtic fans, then why are at least four English and French Premiership clubs showing such interest when Rangers have put a minimum £20m price tag on him?</p>

      <p>“He is only rising in value with every goal he scores and will probably break the Scottish transfer record. Any Premiership club in the world would love to have such a prolific proven goal scorer and that includes Celtic.”</p>
      <p><b>William Wilson</b> emailed: “All Celtic fans going on about Morelos not scoring against them seem to forget their ‘great Dixie Deans’ who, even though he scored hat-tricks in cup finals, only hit the net once against Rangers. He ended up more famous for skying a penalty over the bar versus Inter Milan.”</p>
      <p>And <b>Jimmy Strangers</b> from Tranent added: “I had a good laugh at the Celtic fans’ comments all bumping their gums about Morelos missing a sitter for Colombia. Well I saw McGregor, Forrest and Christie all miss sitters when they should have scored. I actually thought they were trying for conversions and those fans should be more observant of their own players.”</p>

      <p>Morelos v <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/odsonne-edouard">Odsonne Edouard</a> is becoming the side story of the season and <b>Joe Smith</b> , Coleraine, said: “Morelos is now a starting player for the first team of the country ranked tenth in the world - just a little more prestigious than France U21s or scoring against one particular side.”</p>
      <p>Onto Scotland’s mini revival and <b>Andy Wilson</b>, Locharbriggs, said: "Three wins on the bounce is all we could have asked for after the Belgium and Russia double headers. Now we need to carry the momentum into the play-offs and hopefully have everyone fit.</p>
      <p>"I thought Greg Taylor was excellent against Cyprus but why do we keep churning out top left-backs? Can we not trade a couple in for two quality centre backs? It must drive Steve Clarke mad."</p>

      <p>But <b>George Wilson</b> , West Sussex, blasted: "Its the usual Scotland mentality. Three wins against the absolute nobodys in football and suddenly they are world beaters and everyone is talking about who they are going to play in the finals.</p>
      <p>"They will choke before then as usual because the players aren't good enough and the manager showed his qualities with a team of defensive hammer throwers at Kilmarnock."</p>
      <p><b>Paddy Gowans</b> was in no mood for optimism either as he emailed: “The truth is Scotland hasn't got the talent of the teams we had in 60s, 70s and 80s. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear.”</p>
      <p>Nope, but we can still make hay while the sun shines Paddy so let’s stick with the positive vibes ahead of the play-off.</p>
      <p>Onto the search for a new manager at Hearts and <b>Dave Florence</b> , Edinburgh, is losing patience with the Jambos.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: "I'm all for taking your time to get the appointment right, but come on Hearts lets get someone in and give them a chance to get settled ahead of the busy December period.</p>
      <p>"Jack Ross is already in with his new side and we are risking being left behind if their form picks up well before ours does."</p>
      <p>Finally, <b>Lewis Doyle</b> , appropriately from Limerick, said: “It’s scandalous both Hibs and Hearts supporters must be kicking themselves as both teams missed a great opportunity to appoint Jose Mourinho.</p>
      <p>“What a blunder he would have given both Celtic and Rangers a run for their money.</p>
      <p>“So Spurs got their man, Scottish football needed a lift.”</p>
      <p>Okay doke Lewis. Maybe the Jambos have been holding out for Mauricio Pochettino all this time?</p>
