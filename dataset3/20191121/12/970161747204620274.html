      <h1>Tories launch 'fake Labour manifesto' website despite 'FactCheckUK' backlash</h1>

      <p>The Conservative Party has been accused of more ‘dirty tricks’ after creating a website which at first glance looks like it belongs to their political rivals.</p>
      <p>Labourmanifesto.co.uk was launched moments before Jeremy Corbyn unveiled his party’s manifesto in Birmingham today.</p>
      <p>The Tories have apparently paid Google advertising fees so their site appears at the of the page when some users search ‘Labour’.</p>
      <p>It has a bright red background, a picture of Corbyn and slogans including ‘no plan for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>’, ‘higher taxes’ and ‘two more referendums’.</p>
      <p>Negative headlines about the Labour leader and a message near the top saying it is a ‘website by the Conservative party’ means it’s easy enough to see who’s really running it.</p>

      <p>Concerns have been raised about voters being misled and confused, with people on social media slamming the Tories as ‘disingenuous and untrustworthy’.</p>
      <p>But Matthew Lesh, head of research at neoliberal think tank the Adam Smith institute wasn’t convinced people would fall for it.</p>
      <p>Sarcastically, he joked: ‘People will be tricked. There’s studies been done on this.’</p>
      <p>Only this week the Conservative Party came under fire for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-slammed-fake-fact-checking-twitter-account-election-debate-11184870/">temporarily changing the name of its Twitter account to ‘factcheckUK’</a> during ITV’s election debate between Corbyn and Boris Johnson.</p>

      <p>Legitimate fact checking organisations called it ‘inappropriate and misleading’ while Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis called it ‘dystopian’.</p>
      <p>Tory Party chairman James Cleverly said the Twitter handle of the account remained as @CCHQPress so it was clear it was a Conservative Party account.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘The reason we did that is because we were calling out the inaccuracies, the lies that were coming out during the debate. The NHS is not for sale.’</p>
      <p>Metro.co.uk has contacted the Conservative Party for comment.</p>
