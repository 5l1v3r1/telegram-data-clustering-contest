            <b>DEG Vs NOR Dream11 And Match Report: Table toppers Deccan Gladiators strike to maintain their ascendancy at the top of the league standings.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Although Deccan Gladiators find themselves on the top of the points tally ahead of today’s impend clash against Northern Warriors, the side will be well aware that the slightest of slip ups at this stage could prove to be an atrocity for them. A slew of sides are persistently snapping at their heels, looking to pounce on the smallest of errors committed by the side to displace them and move into first position.</p>
          <p>With the showpiece league seeing such intense and competitive compettion, Deccan Gladiators will be fortuitously wishing that the weather stays clear for their encounter today after their clash was abandoned yesterday owing to incessant and widespread. Stepping out in pursuit of 119, the side found themselves at 25-1 in 2.2 overs before rain decided to infuriate proceedings to bring an end to what promised to be a tantalising affair.</p>

                <p>It saw the side make it seven points from four encounters with the two wins, a number they’ll be looking to build on when they go at battle against fourth placed Northern Warriors today. The side were thwarted in their most recent outing with the unit’s run chase of what should have been an easily chasuble 103 runs being curbed at just 96 with the side losing wickets at regular intervals to be left distressed.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>Little to go on about the surface but being the third encounter of the day to be contested here and with rain in the air, this wicket will peel off slightly for the bats. Nothing too much to deter them though with the ball coming on as sweetly as ever onto the bat with the side winning the toss set to come out and bat first if the clouds decide to stay away prior to the encounter.</p>

                            <h3>DEG vs NOR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>After his half-century, Deccan Gladiators’ Mohammad Shahzad looks to have revived his outing in the league with the wicket-keeper and opener going onto smash the 24 runs in 8 balls the last time around. This has traditionally been a league the player has loved doling out his expertise in with u envisioning him cantering his way to a stellar knock come today’s encounter as well.</p>
                            <p>From Northern Warriors meanwhile we have decided to move in with Nicholas Pooran with the besmirched wicket-keeper looking to use this league as a means of redemption and revelation. After having been slandered for his involvement in a ball tampering incident, the player has managed to dole out some steady knocks in the league as he strives to earn back lost respect in the cricketing arena.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs NOR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>His team’s top scorer, Shane Watson has been in sublime touch in the league to see us make the Deccan Gladiators opener and captain the first name to be inducted in this facet of our Dream 11 side. He’s up against a bowling unit which can be taken apart easily and the batsman is set to thrive and jubilantly maraud his way to the fence on ample occasions today.</p>
                            <p>Dan Lawrence will be his partner for the day along with Bhanuka Rajapaksa. The player has struggled to justify the role he’s been doled out but it’s a spot which always augurs runs and if he can settle into his grove today, the player is someone who has acquired a versatility of clean hitting. </p>
                            <p>Elsewhere, from the other side of the segment we are decided to indulge in the services of Lendl Simmons. The player has only recently made an advent into his side to bolster up what has been a hay top-order and his side will be looking to him to come out and immerse them in a behemoth of a knock in the opening slot.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs NOR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>In Chris Green, Northern Warriors have a bowler who has risen in stature this edition of the marquee league to become the mainstay of hs side’s bowling unit. The spinner has been in sublime touch, snaring a bagful of wickets to see the side use him at the initial stages of their bowling sortie in a bid to make early inroads.</p>
                            <p>He’s lived upto the massive expectations accorded on his head adequately as well with his one wicket the last time around as well seeing him become the leading wicket taker for the side. The 41 runs in 25 balls see Andre Russell partner him up for the day with the bat being inconsistent but always capable of filling his gloves with a haord of runs when he gets going.</p>
                            <h3>DEG vs NOR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>If northern Warriors are going to have any chance of winning this encounter, they’ll be needing their bowling unit to rope out an impeccable display, one which sees their frontline bowler Rayad Emrit take the onus of delivering an incisive spell. He snagged the two wickets the last time around as well, getting both of them at crucial junctures to see us repose faith in him for this encounter as well.</p>
                            <p>Junaid Siddique comes in as well for us while Mason Crane’s restrictive spell of 1-18 in the previous outing sees him become the lone selection from the opposition.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Shehzad has been picked out as our side’s captain while Russell comes in from the other side to be made the vice-captain.</p>
