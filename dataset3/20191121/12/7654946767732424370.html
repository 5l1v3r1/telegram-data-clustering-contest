      <h1>Correction officer attacked by inmate on Rikers Island</h1>

      <p>A city correction officer was attacked early Thursday on Rikers Island by an inmate who repeatedly whacked him in the head with a wooden object, authorities said.</p>
      <p>The officer, 42, was on duty at the high-security Otis Bantum Correctional Center, trying to assist taking a Bloods gang member to court, when the thug suddenly assaulted him around 4:30 a.m., officials said.</p>
      <p>The wounded guard was rushed to Mount Sinai Queens with non-life-threatening injuries and later released, authorities said.</p>
      <p>“Today’s attack on a Correction Officer on Rikers Island is deeply troubling,” DOC spokesman Peter Thorne said. “The safety and security of our personnel is a top priority and we have zero tolerance for violent behavior towards our officers and non-uniform staff.”</p>
      <p>Keith Lopez, 46, who allegedly assaulted the correction officer, had been locked up on charges of robbery, burglary and criminal possession of a controlled substance, according to sources and records.</p>
      <p>Thorne said the agency is moving to rearrest Lopez, who was removed from the general population, with the Bronx district attorney.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorney’s Office said she expects Lopez to be brought before a judge by Monday.</p>
      <p>An incident report obtained by The Post states that Lopez struck the officer in the head multiple times, leaving the guard with two puncture wounds on his head.</p>
      <p>The officer sprayed an unknown chemical agent — likely pepper spray — at Lopez, putting a stop to the attack, according to the incident report.</p>
      <p>Elias Husamudeen, president of the Correction Officers’ Benevolent Association, called the assault a “violent, unprovoked attack” that is yet another example of how the city’s “soft-on-crime approach has emboldened the inmates to commit more crimes behind bars, knowing full well that they will suffer no consequences for their actions.”</p>
      <p>Husamudeen claimed that the officer was stabbed in the neck during the attack, but the DOC says the officer was not.</p>
      <p>“The culture of violence brought to us from the streets is going to return to the streets if inmates like this are let go,” Husamudeen said. “Instead of giving inmates who assault our members a free pass or making us wait seven years for safer jails, the city needs to start listening to us and make the jails safer now!”</p>
      <p>The 46-year-old inmate who assaulted the correction officer had been locked up on charges of robbery, burglary and criminal possession of a controlled substance, according to sources and records.</p>
