      <h1>Why Plymouth Argyle's new date for Grimsby Town home game might not be until 2020</h1>
      <h2>The fixture was postponed on November 2 due to structural damage to the Barn Park End roof</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:21:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:21</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle’s postponed League Two game against Grimsby Town from earlier this month is unlikely to be played until the New Year.</p>
      <p>The Home Park fixture on November 2 was called off less than three hours before kick-off due to structural damage to the Barn Park End roof after overnight gales.</p>
      <p>Rearranging a new date for the game has been complicated by the fact that Grimsby have had three matches postponed over the past month.</p>
      <p>Argyle’s continued involvement in the FA Cup has ruled out the possibility of playing the Mariners next Saturday, which would otherwise have been a free date for both clubs.</p>
      <p>Grimsby lost 2-0 away to Newport County in their first round replay on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims are in second round action away to Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Stadium on Sunday December 1.</p>
      <p>That leaves the possibility of a replay at Home Park on the week commencing December 9, ruling out another potential date to take on Grimsby.</p>
      <p>The Mariners had their league game at home to Cheltenham Town on October 26 postponed due to a waterlogged pitch.</p>
      <p>Then, after the Argyle fixture was called off, Grimsby also had a free Saturday last weekend.</p>
      <p>Their scheduled home match against Newport County was postponed due to international call-ups for their Welsh opponents.</p>
      <p>Grimsby have now rearranged to host Cheltenham at Blundell Park next Tuesday, November 26, but a date to play Argyle is still to be agreed.</p>
      <p>Pilgrims’ boss Ryan Lowe said: “I don’t think anything has been sorted just yet because we have to be careful of the FA Cup, in case there is a replay.</p>
      <p>“I think they were trying to get it in that week but obviously we can’t. I believe it’s going to be in the New Year.”</p>
