      <h1>Report: Mourinho battles Guardiola to bring Portugal star Dias to Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Ruben Dias has a £59m release clause.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:45:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola could be locked in a transfer tussle for Ruben Dias.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/jose-mourinho-tottenham-hotspur-news-mauricio-pochettino-spurs-manager-transfers-a9210781.html">According to The Independent</a>, Mourinho wants to sign Benfica star Dias to bolster his defence at Tottenham Hotspur. He has met with Daniel Levy and Dias features on a list of targets, alongside Nemanja Matic and Bruno Fernandes.</p>
      <p>But Spurs will face competition from reigning champions Manchester City in this race. <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/man-city-join-race-man-20551517?x&amp;_ga=2.255089480.1950359517.1570439638-1466405788.1568555175">According to a recent report by The Mirror</a>, Guardiola is keen on signing Dias, who has a £59m release clause. Benfica are determined to fend off suitors so they are trying to increase his buy-out price to £79m.</p>

      <p>Dias is currently a star performer in Benfica’s defence. The 22-year-old has played 17 matches this season and over 100 in total for the Portuguese giants.</p>
      <p>The 16-cap Portugal international is starring for club and country so it is no surprise to see clubs lining up a move. He could be Mourinho’s first new addition as Tottenham manager.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>This would be a shrewd piece of business for Spurs as this is an area that needs addressing. Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are out of contract next summer and Mourinho needs to talk with both of those players.</p>
      <p>It is wise to have a back-up plan and Dias would offer short and long-term solutions. The youngster offers the perfect blend of youth and experience that Tottenham need to push on.</p>
