      <p>Javadekar spoke about the importance of the film industry to the country. “Indian films are the soft power of our country and Film Bazaar will ensure that our films get a proper exposure and market internationally.”</p>
      <p>He highlighted: “This year even before the Film Bazaar has started, there are already more than 1,000 registrations including writers, directors, distributors and other industry participants, from places as far as Argentina.”</p>
      <p>Babul Supriyo, Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said, “This film festival is an excellent platform for the film fraternity. It is profitable and encouraging for all. I believe it will also encourage the ‘Digital India’ dream of our Prime Minister.”</p>
      <p>The occasion also saw the launch of a promotional film on NFDC’s Film Facilitation Office by Javadekar. The film highlighted the breadth of international films shot in India as well as the new initiative of single window clearance.</p>
      <p>The 13th Edition of Film Bazaar will be held from November 20-24 in Goa.</p>
