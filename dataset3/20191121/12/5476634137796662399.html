      <h1>Chelsea fancied to stay in the running for a top four finish</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:02:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:02</time> by <a rel="author">Barry Bridges</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea head into one of the busiest periods of the season aiming to maintain their place amongst the leading teams in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Eight wins and two draws in their opening 12 matches has fired the Blues up to third in the standings, eight points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s side will now embark on a run of nine league matches in 40 days that could have a huge influence on how the rest of the campaign pans out.</p>
      <p>Chelsea visit Manchester City on November 23 eager to prove that they are genuine contenders for a top four finish this term.</p>
      <p>However, the reigning champions will be keen to return to winning ways after being defeated by Liverpool in their most recent outing.</p>
      <p>If the Blues can take something from the Etihad Stadium it would set them up nicely for four winnable games over the following two weeks.</p>
      <p>Home games against West Ham United on November 30 and Aston Villa the following Wednesday provide the Blues with a perfect opportunity to add to their points tally.</p>
      <p>Both matches are expected to sell out, but Wow Tickets offers fans <a href="https://www.wowtickets.football/teams/chelsea-fc">an easy way to get tickets to a Chelsea game</a>.</p>
      <p>Everton (A) and Bournemouth (H) are next on the agenda for Lamaprd’s side and they will be strong favourites to win both matches.</p>
      <p>Jose Mourinho’s <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">appointment as Tottenham Hotspur manager</a> certainly adds an intriguing dimension to their clash with Chelsea on December 22.</p>

      <p>The 56-year-old has replaced Mauricio Pochettino in the Spurs hot-seat and he will undoubtedly be desperate to get one over his former club.</p>
      <p>Pochettino’s exit is no major surprise given Spurs’ form this season and Mourinho has a big job on his hands at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
      <p>Chelsea follow up their visit to Spurs with a home game against Southampton on Boxing Day, before travelling across London to face Arsenal three days later.</p>
      <p>The Gunners have also been underperforming this season and the Blues will fancy their chances of producing a good performance at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p>Chelsea kick-off 2020 with a trip to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on New Years’ Day for a game that should complete a productive spell for the club.</p>
      <p>A minimum 20-point return from their next nine fixtures doesn’t look beyond Chelsea and would keep them firmly in the running to secure a top four place in the <a href="https://sportslens.com/premier-league-table/">Premier League table</a> this season.</p>
      <p>Having been hampered by <a href="https://www.talkchelsea.net/opinions/the-frank-lampard-philosophy-that-means-he-could-need-to-sign-1-or-2-strikers-in-january/">the club’s transfer embargo</a> Lampard has done well to get the Blues in the mix and it’s highly likely they’ll still be in the running when January comes around.</p>
