      <h1>Olsen: Winter on the wild side</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:57:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:57</time> by <a rel="author">Debbie Olsen for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Winter is an exciting time of year for wildlife watching and as my husband and I drove up Maligne Lake road in Jasper National Park, we were carefully watching for any signs of wildlife. One of the bellmen at the <a href="https://www.fairmont.com/jasper/?cmpid=google_jpl_search-branded-canada_branded-e-revsh&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAn8nuBRCzARIsAJcdIfPCq-a24cj4UJue7EZ4PsuvKRvSIhH8ki8hU6YEHXgPftj0fe1d4XoaAuljEALw_wcB">Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge</a> told us eight moose were on the road two days earlier and we were hoping to break his record. We had the camera sitting on the seat between us — just in case.  As we rounded a corner, we spotted four moose on the road in front of us. Two females and two males were licking salt off the road and munching on twigs near its edge. The fluffy white snow made a perfect photo backdrop and we both reached for the camera at the same time.</p>
      <p>In many ways, the monochromatic landscape of winter makes wildlife easier to see. Even though you won’t see bears on a winter wildlife safari, other species like elk, deer, moose, bison, coyotes and wolves are very active in winter.</p>
      <p>It’s fun to get outdoors and go exploring. Here are some of the best places in Alberta to enjoy a winter wildlife safari.</p>

      <h3>Jasper National Park</h3>
      <p>Winter wildlife viewing is fantastic in Jasper and Maligne Lake Road is one of the best drives for that. Moose, deer and bighorn sheep are commonly seen along this roadway. Maligne Canyon, Medicine Lake and Maligne Lake are great spots to get out of the car and we stopped to explore each — looking for animal tracks and making a few tracks of our own in the frozen landscape. We spotted elk just outside the Jasper townsite and on the road to Lac Beauvert and the Jasper Park Lodge. The road to Pyramid Lake is also a good place to look for wildlife and you can go skating on the lake or enjoy a sleigh ride around it. It’s common to see bighorn sheep on the Icefields Parkway between Jasper and Banff. If you prefer a guided experience, <a href="https://www.sundogtours.com/package/wildlife-discovery-tour/">Sundog Tours</a> offers winter wildlife watching tours in small motor coaches.</p>

      <h3>Banff and Canmore</h3>
      <p>Look for elk and deer in and around the Banff townsite. Lake Minnewanka Road is a great winter wildlife drive and you might see elk, mule deer, white tail deer, foxes, wolves or coyotes. Bring your skates and you can enjoy a skate on the lake — when the conditions are right. You might also see wildlife on the road leading to Cave and Basin National Historic Site. In the Canmore area, Spray Lakes Road is the No. 1 winter wildlife drive. Look for bighorn sheep, elk, moose, coyotes and cougars. The Canmore Nordic Centre makes a great stop — especially if you enjoy cross-country skiing. The Bow Valley Trail is another great wildlife drive near Canmore and it’s common to see bighorn sheep from the road in winter. <a href="https://www.banfftours.com/activities/discover-banff-winter/">Discover Banff Tours</a> offers guided winter wildlife watching tours in Banff.</p>

      <h3>Elk Island National Park</h3>
      <p>About 40 minutes west of Edmonton, Elk Island National Park is home to the densest population of hoofed mammals in Canada. Plains bison, wood bison, elk, moose, mule deer and white-tailed deer are commonly seen in the park in winter. You might also spot coyotes, wolves, lynxes, great horned owls, snowy owls, pileated woodpeckers and other birds.  “Winter is a wonderful time for wildlife viewing in Elk Island National Park, says Brennan Bunko, promotions officer at Elk Island National Park. “It’s much easier to see wildlife against the vibrant white colour of the snowy landscape. It’s also fascinating to get outside and look for animal tracks in fresh snow.” Bison are so well insulated that the snow doesn’t melt very quickly off their backs and that makes them fun to photograph in winter. The park is one of the few places in the world where you can see plains and wood bison roaming freely.</p>

      <h3>Winter Wildlife Viewing &amp; Photography Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Dusk and dawn are the best times of day for wildlife viewing and photography. The light is usually better, and animals tend to be most active during those times.</li>
        <li>Always check road reports, make sure your gas tank is full, you have warm clothes and you are prepared for emergencies before you head out on the road in winter.</li>
        <li>A local visitor information centre can tell you about the latest wildlife sightings and the best places to see wildlife in the area.</li>
        <li>Keep your distance when photographing wildlife. Never feed or touch a wild animal.</li>
        <li>If you’re driving and you spot an animal, pull over to the side of the road and stay in your vehicle.</li>
        <li>Photographing in snow can be a challenge. In our experience, it’s better to overexpose by a half stop to ensure your whites don’t look grey.</li>
      </ul>
