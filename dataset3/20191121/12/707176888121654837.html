      <h2>Closure to external money after three decades follows run of poor returns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:00:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Laurence Fletcher, Miles Kruppa, Ortenca Aliaj</a></address>
      <p>Louis Bacon, the veteran hedge fund manager, is closing his flagship hedge funds to external money and stepping back from day-to-day trading at his 30-year-old Moore Capital Management, according to a letter sent to investors on Thursday. </p>
      <p>The decision, which would mark one of the industry’s most high-profile retreats to date, follows years of diminished performance and outflows at Moore’s global macro hedge funds, which trade stocks, bonds, currencies and other financial instruments.</p>
      <p>“Intense competition for trading talent coupled with client pressure on fees has led to a challenging business model for multi manager funds such as ours,” Mr Bacon wrote in a letter to investors seen by the Financial Times. “Our move to a proprietary funded asset base will allow us to be more opportunistic in acquiring investment talent and more competitive with those whom have a ‘pass through’ structure.” </p>
      <p>The New York-based firm, which expects to return most of its outside capital in the first quarter of next year, will consolidate its three flagship funds into one proprietary fund to manage internal money. The letter cited “disappointing results of these funds of the last few years,” but said that “our long term track record is one we remain proud of.”</p>
      <p>Mr Bacon also told investors that he is scaling back his involvement to allow “more personal time for a large family, philanthropic pursuits and to continue to develop a number of sports oriented properties.”</p>
      <p>Moore is “not morphing into a family office as some others have done of late”, the letter added, and it intends to launch individual funds managed by its best performing portfolio managers. “These individual manager offerings will remain inside of Moore,” it said.*</p>
      <p>Over the past decade Moore’s assets under management have declined to $8.9bn at the end of last year, according to regulatory filings. </p>
      <blockquote><b>$19bn<br/></b><br/>Investor profits over the life of Moore’s three flagship funds</blockquote>
      <p>Returning money to outside investors would see Mr Bacon, 63, joining other prominent hedge fund managers such as Leon Cooperman‘s Omega Advisors and Michael Platt’s BlueCrest who have called time on <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/47ba9fdc-201c-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65">external money</a> in recent years, amid an increasing regulatory burden, pressure on fees, and a prolonged period of low interest rates that has frustrated many macro managers. </p>
      <p>Raised in North Carolina, Mr Bacon began his trading career at Commodities Corporation in the 1980s, where he cut his teeth alongside future hedge fund stars Bruce Kovner and Paul Tudor Jones.</p>
      <p>Mr Bacon is viewed by peers as one of the most successful traders of his generation, known for his ability to shift between positions based on macroeconomic judgments. He won early acclaim for making gains of 86 per cent in 1990 after betting on the crash of Japanese markets, and returning 45 per cent in 1992 when the European Exchange Rate Mechanism collapsed.</p>
      <p>But since the 2008 financial crisis, Mr Bacon has also struggled to match Moore’s historical record.</p>
      <p>The three flagship Moore funds have returned around $19bn in profits to investors during their lifespan, the investor letter said. This year to date all three funds are up “low single digits.” Macro funds are up 5.4 per cent this year on average, to the end of October, according to data group HFR.</p>
      <p>Before deciding to return capital, Mr Bacon had been pitching investors on a fund managed by one of his top-performing traders, Joeri Jacobs, people briefed on the matter said. It is unclear whether the fund will now spin out independently. </p>

      <p>A frequent fixture at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr Bacon has been an influential voice among global policymakers. During the 2011 European crisis, he led a group of Wall Street executives who met with the Federal Reserve before it and other central banks flooded the eurozone with cheap debt.</p>
      <p>Following US president Donald Trump’s election in 2016, Mr Bacon sent a rare letter to investors predicting macro trading would flourish under the new administration. The letter said Mr Trump’s victory would lead to higher interest rates, increased corporate spending and a stronger dollar, creating trading opportunities in commodities and emerging markets.</p>
      <p>Mr Bacon later expressed doubts about Mr Trump, telling the hedge fund publication Absolute Return he had misjudged the president’s ability to govern.</p>
      <p>Forbes magazine estimates that Mr Bacon’s net worth is $1.5bn. He has given money largely to environmental causes. In 2012, he donated close to 167,000 acres of land on his Colorado ranch to the US Fish and Wildlife Service for conservation purposes, marking the largest ever easement in the US.</p>
