      <h1>Ja Rule Emerges From $100M Fyre Festival Lawsuit Without A Cent To Pay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:31:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53387/title.ja-rule-reminds-twitter-50-cent-got-beat-up-stabbed-shot">Ja Rule</a> is reportedly off the hook in the<a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.43252/title.ja-rules-fyre-festival-facing-100m-lawsuit"> $100 million class action lawsuit</a> stemming from 2017’s failed Fyre Festival. According to <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/legal-and-management/8544191/ja-rule-fyre-festival-lawsuit-dismissed">Billboard,</a> Ja Rule — real name Jeffery Atkins — and Fyre Fest’s chief marketing officer Grant Margolin have been dropped from the ongoing case in an order filed November 7.</p>
      <p>Both the Murder Inc. founder and Margolin were <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52079/title.ja-rule-officially-innocent-in-fyre-festival-lawsuit">originally dismissed</a> in a July decision by Judge P. Kevin Castel.</p>
      <p>However, the plantiffs’ law firm Geragos &amp; Geragos filed an appeal to keep Rule and Margolin locked in the case, although they couldn’t prove people were persuaded to purchase tickets for the botched event as a result of Rule’s promotional tweet in April.</p>

      <p>Rule’s attorney Ryan Hayden Smith said, “In July, the Court dismissed all Fyre Festival claims against Mr. Atkins. After this loss, plaintiffs’ law firm Geragos &amp; Geragos appealed that decision, and the Court denied their appeal. This ruling is nothing short of a total vindication of Mr. Atkins.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.50388/title.ja-rule-gives-his-most-open-interview-on-fyre-festival-yet">Fyre Festival</a> and its founder Billy McFarland are still facing the class action lawsuit against them.</p>
      <p>McFarland was <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.48767/title.fyre-festival-organizer-sentenced-to-6-years-in-prison-for-wire-fraud">sentenced to six years behind bars</a> for wire fraud in October 2018.</p>
