      <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad says Pakatan Harapan can sack him if they want.</p>
      <p>That was his response to calls for him to step down immediately after the by-election defeat in Johor.</p>
      <p>He was asked if a quick transition between him and Anwar would solve the leadership issues in the Harapan coalition.</p>
      <p>“Well, it is up to the party.</p>

      <p>“They (Harapan presidential council) can sack me if they want to,” he says.</p>
      <p>There have been growing calls for Dr Mahathir to quit his post and let Anwar Ibrahim take over from both grassroots and leaders of a component party in Pakatan.</p>
      <p>The PKR, Anwar Ibrahim’s party, is also in turmoil after its deputy president Azmin Ali, who is also the Economic Affairs Minister met with opposition members at a secret dinner.</p>
      <p>People close to the MPs heading for the dinner leaked the information to the media that was seen grouping at Azmin’s house in Putrajaya, the siege of power in Malaysia.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, Dr Mahathir says a transition of power would create problems if it was made ‘midstream’, adding that it is not important <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/500606">what happens to him</a>.</p>
      <p>“The thing is that if you have changes midstream, it is very confusing. It creates a lot of problems.</p>
      <p>“But of course if I’m sacked I don’t know. But I think I need to be serious about this thing.</p>
      <p>“What happens to me is not something important. But what happens to the government and the country is really important,” he says. -TISG</p>
