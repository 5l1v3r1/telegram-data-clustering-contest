      <h1>Don't Sleep on This Massive 40% off Black Friday Sale at Emma Mattress</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:40:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>The website is rolling out its biggest deal to date and you've got two weeks to get in on it.</p>
      <p>Emma Mattress has amassed quite the collection of accolades from a range of sites singing its praises, and the <a href="https://www.emma-mattress.co.uk/emma-bedding/">Black Friday sale</a> gives you the perfect opportunity to try it our for yourself - especially with the 100 nights risk-free trial period, on top of free delivery and returns.</p>
      <p>The largest mattress - a super king size - usually retails at £799, but with the Black Friday discount, that drops down to just £479.40 which is absolutely mental. Mattresses are notoriously pricey, and if you can save over £300 to fritter away on throws, pillows, and other boudoir accoutrements, then that sounds like a fantastic idea to us.</p>
      <p>Just use the code BLACK40 at checkout to get your discount, although the site will give you a prompt when you get to your basket, so there's little chance of you forgetting to take advantage of it, so if you somehow manage to miss the glaring prompts that's likely to be the least of your problems.</p>
      <p>The sale is on now and wraps up on Monday, December 8. We've got <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/search?searchTerm=black+friday">Black Friday deals</a> coverage coming out of the wazoo here at Giz UK, so be sure to swing by our hub so you don't miss any. Because there are <i>a lot</i>.</p>
