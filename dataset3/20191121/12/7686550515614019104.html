      <h2>Allowing private companies to tender to run services in the NHS would raise concerns about our public health service</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T12:35:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 12:35</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Shipton</a></address>
      <p>Brexit all began with the NHS, of course.</p>
      <p>The official Leave campaign falsely claimed that the UK was paying £350m a week to the European Union that could be diverted to the health service.</p>
      <p>Millions bought the idea – and other undeliverable promises – and in June 2016 the UK voted to quit the EU.</p>
      <p>As was confirmed on countless occasions during Tuesday evening’s ITV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, so far as Mr Johnson is concerned the election is about “getting Brexit done”.</p>
      <p>Getting Brexit done, however, won’t be as simple as he’d have us believe.</p>
      <p>If he wins the majority he is seeking, Mr Johnson should be able to keep his latest promise on the Brexit timescale.</p>
      <p>Having forced all 635 of his party’s candidates to vote for his deal – anyone else was purged – we will be out of the EU by the January 31 deadline if the election is won.</p>
      <p>We’ll immediately go into transitional limbo and start the second phase of negotiations about our future trading relationship with the EU.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson is determined that we should not be in political alignment with the EU27, but completely free to negotiate trade deals of our own with other countries.</p>
      <p>That means we’ll be out of the customs union as well as the single market – which is regarded as beyond the pale by the Conservatives because it would entail keeping freedom of movement.</p>
      <p>It would be foolish to pretend that we can replace easily our current EU export market with trading links elsewhere, so Mr Johnson would be looking for a deal with a big economy like the United States as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>Having given up our EU membership, we would inevitably be at a disadvantage in trade negotiations with the US.</p>
      <p>They strike a hard bargain, as their neighbours to the south in Latin America know very well, and we know from a heavily redacted disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act brandished by Mr Corbyn during the ITV debate that secret talks have already taken place between UK and US government officials about a future free trade deal.</p>
      <p>Leaked information to the Channel 4 Dispatches programme means we know that the highly sensitive matter of medicine pricing for the NHS has been discussed in all of the meetings between the two governments’ representatives over the last two and a half years.</p>
      <p>Public statements made by the likes of US Ambassador Woody Johnson have already made it clear that the US expects to get access to the NHS as part of a trade deal.</p>
      <p>When Mr Johnson is challenged about this, he goes into his usual bluster over-drive, insisting the NHS is a precious institution that he loves, and that Labour’s allegation that he is planning to “sell it off” is no more than scaremongering.</p>
      <p>Strictly speaking, the suggestion that the NHS would be “sold off” is almost certainly inaccurate. What is far more likely is that elements of it – hospital services, for example – could be hived off to private companies who were invited to submit tenders for the contracts.</p>
      <p>But accuracy tends to defer to soundbites during an election campaign, and “Our NHS is not for sale” is catchier than “We don’t want NHS services to be put out to tender”.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, introducing the private sector into the NHS on such a scale, and giving American companies the opportunity to bid for the contracts, would raise serious doubts about whether the UK’s best-loved public sector body was still in the public sector.</p>
      <p>It’s reasonable to argue that the NHS’s status would be analogous to that of the railway network, where the public sector invites the private sector to bid for rail service franchises on a geographical basis.</p>
      <p>The detail of this wasn’t gone into on Tuesday evening during the TV debate, but hopefully it will be before election day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile the SNP has announced plans for an NHS Protection Bill that it intends to introduce in Westminster after the election.</p>
      <p>Although health is a devolved policy area, international trade deals aren’t, so the Scottish Parliament and the Senedd would be powerless to block a Tory government from effectively privatising the NHS via a free trade deal with the US.</p>
      <p>Parliament, however, could take back control, to coin a phrase, and pass the SNP Bill that would tie the hands of Mr Johnson and prevent him from opening up the NHS to bids from US companies.</p>
      <p>A briefing note from the SNP on the proposal states: “The Protection Act would enshrine in law that our NHS must be protected as publicly-owned, publicly-operated, and its services publicly-commissioned.</p>
      <p>“The Act would underpin that any goods or services that are procured by the NHS must be explicitly prevented from being subject to any future ‘investment protection mechanisms’ / ‘investor-state dispute resolution mechanisms’.</p>
      <p>This means that private sector businesses would not be able to take the UK government to court and insist that it put elements of the NHS out to tender.</p>
      <p>The NHS Protection Bill would also provide double-lock protection by insisting that future trade deals would require the explicit consent of the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly, and Northern Irish Assembly [when it’s sitting].</p>
      <p>Asked about the SNP Bill, a Welsh Labour spokesman repeated the party line: “We have been clear our NHS is not for sale. We are very proud that the NHS in Wales remains free at the point of use for all and Labour will do all it can to keep it that way.</p>
      <p>“The biggest threat to the NHS in the UK is Boris Johnson and a Tory government willing to put the NHS up for sale as part of a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.”</p>
      <p>If Mr Johnson wins his overall majority, his MPs and those from other parties can block the privatisation of the NHS simply by passing the SNP Bill.</p>
