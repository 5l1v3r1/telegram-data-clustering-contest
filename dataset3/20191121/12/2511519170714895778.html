      <p>A powerful <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Earthquake">earthquake</a> swayed buildings in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Bangkok">Bangkok</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/hanoi">Hanoi</a> after it shook an area around the Thai-<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Laos">Laos</a> border.</p>
      <p>The epicentre of the 6.1 magnitude quake was just inside Sainyabuli province in Laos and was felt in the surrounding area, including nearby northern <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Thailand">Thailand</a>.</p>
      <p>High-rise buildings in Thailand’s capital, over 600km away, reportedly rocked for half a minute. Lights swung from ceilings in videos posted online. </p>
      <p>Residents of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chiang-mai">Chiang Mai</a>, northern Thailand’s biggest city, felt prolonged shaking but saw no major damage.</p>
      <p>There were no immediate reports of casualties.</p>
      <p>Residents near the epicentre, just 31km away from parts of Thailand’s Nan province, said they had felt aftershocks.</p>
      <p>The shallow earthquake was only 10km below the surface and struck around 6.50am, according to the Thai Meteorological Department.</p>
      <p>Chiang Mai resident Petchnoi Osathaphan said the long shaking left her feeling dizzy.</p>
      <p>“There are three new cracks at the baseboards and close to the windows,” she said of her house near the Mae Ping River.</p>
      <p>Vibrations were also felt in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi. </p>
