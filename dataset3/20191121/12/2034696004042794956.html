      </p>
      <p>Al Pacino has said that he’s started deliberately starring in bad films in order to “try to make them better”.</p>
      <p>The actor was speaking in a joint interview with his long-time collaborator Robert De Niro.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>During the interview, with <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/al-pacino-and-robert-deniro-godfathers-of-the-year-2019"><i>GQ</i></a>, Pacino referenced a “bad habit” that he’s started getting himself into. “I think I’m starting to get a little perverse,” he began.</p>
      <p>“I’m starting to want to do films that aren’t really very good and try to make them better.<i> </i>And that’s become my challenge.”</p>
      <p>The actor continued: “I don’t think I go in thinking it’s not gonna be very good, but it’s like Bob said: Sometimes they offer you money to do something that’s not adequate. And you talk yourself into it. And somewhere within you, you know that this thing is gonna be a lemon.</p>

      <p>Al Pacino is reunited with Robert De Niro on screen in ‘The Irishman’.</p>
      <p>“But then, when it comes full circle, and you see it, you say, ‘Oh, no. I’m gonna make this better.’ And you spend a lot of time and you’re doing all these things, and you say, ‘If I can just get this to be a <i>mediocre</i> film’, and you get <i>excited</i> by that. It’s an impulse that I’ve got to just put away now.”</p>
      <p>We assume this new tact didn’t have to apply to<i> The Irishman</i>, which saw Pacino and De Niro reuniting on screen in Martin Scorsese’s new crime drama.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/the-irishman-review-martin-scorsese-robert-de-niro">An <i>NME</i> review of <i>The Irishman</i></a> said: “If this is to be Pesci, De Niro and Scorsese’s final fling together, then they couldn’t wish to end on a better note. The director’s 26th feature film is a meditative and classy offering. Hollywood’s old cronies are still the real deal – magnetic, riveting and unique. Let’s hope we see them again soon.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/this-is-it-robert-de-niro-doesnt-think-hell-make-another-movie-with-al-pacino-and-martin-scorsese-2563440">Robert De Niro recently said that he doesn’t think he’ll make another movie with Al Pacino and Martin Scorsese</a>.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see us putting on a movie like this,” he told <i>The Guardian</i>. “I hope we do other films together, but like this? Not likely. This is it.”</p>
