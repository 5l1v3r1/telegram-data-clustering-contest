      <p>A pregnant Muslim woman, who is 38 weeks along, was brutally attacked by a random man at a western Sydney cafe late Wednesday, Australian media reported Thursday.</p>
      <p>According to The Sydney Morning Herald, 31-year-old Rana Elasmar was with friends, all of whom wear headscarves, in a cafe in Parramatta when Stipe Lozina, 43, allegedly leaned over their table, punched her in the head and stomp on her after she fell to the floor.</p>
      <p>A video from security cameras shows Lozina approaching the group, starting a brief conversation and then attacking the woman. He punched Elasmar at least 14 times in the head and then stomped on her twice after she fell.</p>
      <p>A man allegedly made a comment about Muslims before punching the woman, the newspaper said.</p>
      <p>Following the attack, the man was taken to Parramatta police station where he was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray.</p>
      <p>Lozina appeared without legal representation before Parramatta Local Court on Thursday, submitting an unsuccessful application for bail.</p>
      <p>Elasmar was taken to Westmead Hospital for observation and was later released.</p>
