      <p>Israeli Prime Minister <b>Benjamin Netanyahu</b> was indicted on Thursday on allegations of widespread corruption.</p>
      <p>Attorney General <b>Avichai Mendelblit</b> publicly announced that Netanyahu was being charged in three different cases with bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, according to a report from <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-charged-bribery-fraud-corruption-israel-election-1.8137771">Haaretz</a>. The cases, formally referred to as Case 4000, 2000, and 1000, respectively, make Netanyahu the first sitting Prime Minister in Israeli history to be charged with bribery.</p>
      <p>The bribery charges against Netanyahu, which are particularly serious, reportedly center around his involvement in an alleged deal to intervene in regulatory matters that financially benefitted Israeli businessman <b>Shaul Elovich</b>. At the time, Netanyahu was serving as Israelâ€™s Communications Minister.</p>
      <p>Elovich, who owned the Bezeq telecommunications company and the Walla News reportedly netted approximately <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahus-illicit-dealings-benefited-tycoon-by-500-million-ag-alleges/">$500 million</a> from a quid pro quo deal. For assisting Elovich, Netanyahu was reportedly granted the authority to change how Walla News covered Israeli politics, benefitting Netanyahu and targeting his opponents with negative stories.</p>
      <p>Attorneys for Netanyahu claim that he merely attempted to push Walla News to pursue a more balanced political perspective while also arguing that positive news coverage would not constitute a bribe under the law.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is also accused of attempting to bribe the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper for favorable news coverage by promising to limit the circulation of a rival paper. These allegations form the basis of Case 2000 in which Netanyahu is accused of breach of trust and fraud.</p>
      <p>Case 1000, which also accuses Netanyahu of fraud and breach of trust stems from allegations that he used his public office to solicit gifts from billionaires <b>James Packer </b>and<b> Arnon Milchan</b> for himself and his family.</p>
      <p>PM Netanyahu is scheduled to address the public in a press conference later Thursday.</p>
