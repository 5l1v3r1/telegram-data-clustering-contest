      <p><b>Mumbai:</b> The Shiv Sena on Thursday targeted the Modi government over Delhi police's "inhuman" lathicharge on JNU students, including those challenged visually, during a protest against hostel fee hike, saying no government should run amok in this manner.</p>
      <p>The Sena, engaged in talks with Congress and NCP to form a coalition government in Maharashtra, said the ruling BJP would have created a ruckus in Parliament had such action against students been taken during the Grand Old Party's rule.</p>

      <p>As Delhi is a Union territory, the responsibility to maintain law and order rests with the Centre, it said.</p>
      <p>The Uddhav Thackeray-led party said it was worrying to see the way visually-challenged and divyang students were allegedly thrashed by Delhi police on Monday, after they were stopped from marching to Parliament against hostel fee hike by the JNU administration.</p>
      <p>While the students alleged they were baton charged, police have denied having used force.</p>
      <p>"The lathicharge on JNU students in Delhi was inhuman... The BJP would have created a ruckus in Parliament and organisations like ABVP would have given a call for nationwide bandh had such an incident taken place during the Congress rule," the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana'.</p>
      <p>"The police force which thrashes visually-challenged ones cannot be servants of people and protectors of law. Do not trample down at least the students. No government should run amok in this manner," it said.</p>
      <p>The party, however, said students also need to maintain discipline.</p>
      <p>None will support the students' action of crossing barricades during protest on Monday, it said.</p>
      <p>Terming the hike in JNU hostel fee "exorbitant", the Sena sought to know what the government has done to address the concerns raised by the students.</p>
      <p>It said the minister concerned could have reached out to the students and heard their grudge out. It said those following right-wing ideology have been alleging that the JNU is a "den" of Naxalites and people with left-wing inclinations.</p>
      <p>"The university, however, has also produced Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee, some of the top politicians and experts," it said, observing none of them followed right-wing ideology.</p>
