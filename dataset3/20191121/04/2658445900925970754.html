      <p>The days of lawyers using complicated legal jargons in official documents are gone, the partners of Pavestones, a commercial law firm, have said.</p>
      <p>According to them, today’s law practice is about simplicity and meeting clients’ tailored needs.</p>
      <p>The firm, which marked its first anniversary on September 27, was founded by two female lawyers, Seun Timi-Koleolu and Aderonke Alex-Adedipe.</p>
      <p>Timi-Koleolu was formerly with Aluko &amp; Oyebode and later worked as an in-house counsel at Etisalat.</p>
      <p>Alex-Adedipe was formerly a Partner at Strachan Partners.</p>
      <p>One of the firm’s core values, they said, is simplicity.</p>
      <p>“We believe that it is no longer attractive to provide heavily worded legal opinions and documentation to clients. In short terms, we are here to change the game!” Timi-Koleolu said.</p>
      <p>Alex-Adedipe added that Pavestones is revolutionising the practice of law by creating a work-life balance and adopting the use of modern technology in delivering legal services.</p>
      <p>She said: “We recognise that technology is the future and we are deliberately positioned to serve the rapidly growing industry. These combined, encourage inclusiveness and above all, efficiency in service delivery.”</p>
      <p>The duo said it seemed only like yesterday that the idea of Pavestones was conceived.</p>
      <p>“In September 2018, we joined forces to establish Pavestones. We discovered an opportunity in what many consider an obstacle (deviating from the norm), opened our doors for business, hit the ground running and after one eventful year, we can conveniently say that we are proud of our achievements.</p>
      <p>“Our team has tripled in size and we have advised several local and international clients across various sectors.</p>
      <p>“Pavestones was founded by two young, incredibly strong and resilient women. Our lawyers have had experience working at top law firms in Nigeria, servicing clients ranging from government entities to multinational and small companies.</p>
      <p>“At Pavestones, we are commercially savvy and modern in our approach. We provide legal services to startups and large corporations by helping them transform their innovative ideas into reality whilst ensuring the continuity and scalability of those ideas,” Timi-Koleolu said.</p>

      <p>Alex-Adedipe said in advising clients, the firm demonstrates knowledge of clients’ businesses, combined with a high level of professionalism, enabling them to make informed decisions by anticipating potential legal issues.</p>
      <p>Her words: “We operate a modern law practice with a particular focus on foreign investment, finance and technology.</p>
      <p>“Generally, our firm continues to develop in several unconventional ways. In our one year of existence, we have successfully advised clients who provide services in the financing, technology, gaming, health, insurance and e-commerce industries.</p>
      <p>“It continues to be our privilege to support our clients and help their businesses through every step of the way.</p>
      <p>“We are grateful for the confidence that our clients have entrusted in us and we are incredibly optimistic about the future! We are also thankful to our friends and well-wishers as we look forward to many more successful years.”</p>
