      <h1>DANA strikes e-payment deal with Blue Bird taxi, eyes KRL and motorcycle taxis</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:27:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Indonesian digital wallet DANA has scored an important business partner in Blue Bird, one of Indonesia’s largest taxi companies, in its bid to be among the top players in the country’s fast-expanding e-payment scene.</p>
      <p>The collaboration was officially announced in a press conference in Jakarta yesterday. From now on, taxi bookings made via Blue Bird’s My Blue Bird app can be paid digitally via a linked DANA account.</p>
      <p>To mark the collaboration’s launch, users who pay using the new feature three times between Nov. 20 and Dec. 31 will be given a free Blue Bird ride worth IDR20K (US$1.42).</p>
      <p>DANA CEO Vincent Iswara said the collaboration marks a significant expansion for the digital wallet into the transportation industry.</p>
      <p>“Blue Bird remains one of the Indonesian people’s modes of transport. We will look at the potential for the next month or two, but what’s clear is that the demand for transportation continues to rise and Blue Bird’s vehicles are getting better,” he said, <a href="https://keuangan.kontan.co.id/news/setelah-blue-bird-dana-akan-gandeng-perusahaan-transportasi-lain">as quoted by </a><a href="https://keuangan.kontan.co.id/news/setelah-blue-bird-dana-akan-gandeng-perusahaan-transportasi-lain"><i>Kontan</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Vincent added that DANA, with its open platform concept, is currently in negotiations to provide e-payment capabilities to Jakarta’s KRL Commuterline train and app-based motorcycle taxis.</p>
      <p>DANA claims that as of October 2019, it has 30 million registered users and sees around 3 million transactions daily.</p>
      <p>DANA, which launched in 2018, has quickly become one of the country’s top digital wallet services, due in no small part to its huge promos to entice customers. As of Q2 2019, <a href="https://www.cnbcindonesia.com/tech/20190815104730-37-92151/daftar-10-dompet-digital-terpopuler-di-ri-siapa-jawaranya">DANA was ranked third</a> in terms of market share behind Gopay, at first place, and Ovo at second.</p>
      <p>According to Bank Indonesia, e-wallet transactions were recorded at US$1.5 billion in 2018, and it’s projected to grow exponentially to US$25 billion per year by 2023.</p>
