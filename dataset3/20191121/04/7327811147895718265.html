      <p>ATLANTA -- Joe Biden incorrectly said during the Democratic presidential debate that he has the support of the "only African American woman ever elected to the Senate."</p>
      <p>That drew a response from California Sen. Kamala Harris, an African American woman on stage alongside Biden and other hopefuls Wednesday in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>Harris interjected by saying that "the other one is here." Sen. Cory Booker, who is also black, said to Biden: "That's not true."</p>
      <p>Biden quickly stated: "I said the first."</p>
      <p>Harris' campaign tweeted moments later: "Proud to be the second Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate."</p>

      <p>Biden was arguing that he has support from black voters, who are critical to a Democratic victory. He says that "they know me."</p>
      <p>Carol Moseley Braun, a Democrat, was the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. She represented Illinois from 1993 until 1999. Moseley Braun lost her re-election bid and was later appointed to serve as the U.S. ambassador to New Zealand.</p>
