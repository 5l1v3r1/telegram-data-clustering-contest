      <h1>86-year-old comedy sensation Lynn Ruth Miller to go wild in Bangkok</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:01:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>While most people are upset by thoughts of aging and death, 86-year-old Lynn Ruth Miller has been killing audiences by laughing about it. </p>
      <p>Possibly the oldest woman doing stand-up comedy, the octogenarian entertainer will grace a Bangkok stage next week and hand out some good ol’ fashioned LOLs.</p>
      <p>Stagetime Comedy Club is rolling out its fourth International Showcase Special, this time featuring American-born Miller, whose style doesn’t only talk about failed marriages and getting old, but also singing and performing burlesque. </p>

      <p>From the state of Ohio, Miller started comedy a decade ago — at 71 and performed at America’s Got Talent in 2008. In 2013, her show <i>Granny’s Gone Wild</i> won an award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. </p>
