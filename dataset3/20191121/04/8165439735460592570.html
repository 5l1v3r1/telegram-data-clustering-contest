      <h4>In an interview with BBC News, Chris Martin opened up about the band's new album, touring and the environment.</h4>
      <blockquote>"We're not touring this album - we're taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable - how can it be actively beneficial. All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job." Coldplay's tours are historically mammoth in size and the amount of dates they plough through make it a huge process in every aspect. Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally - we would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral. The hardest thing is the flying side of things. But, for example, our dream is to have a show with no single use plastic, to have it largely solar powered. We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?"</blockquote>
