      <p>A determined <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dancing">Highland dancer</a> who had a major spine operation is back winning medals – a year after life-changing surgery.</p>
      <p>Isla Robertson, 16, was devastated when she was told she might never dance again after she developed a curve in her back from Scheuermann’s Kyphosis.</p>
      <p>But the schoolgirl had a seven-hour op to straighten her back and, despite now having 15 bolts in her spine, she landed six medals on her return to competition at a recent event in Gourock, Inverclyde.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Isla said: “There was never any guarantee I would get back to that stage so to get there, I’m so grateful – it’s really amazing.</p>
      <p>“I’m feeling a lot better now. I wasn’t doing anything, it was rubbish – but I’m able to live as a teenager again.”</p>
      <p>Isla, from <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/greenock">Greenock</a>, added of her medal haul: “It was so good – I placed in every dance I was in.”</p>
      <p>Mum Alison, 44, said it’s “massive” seeing her daughter back fit and healthy and able to “live her life again”.</p>
