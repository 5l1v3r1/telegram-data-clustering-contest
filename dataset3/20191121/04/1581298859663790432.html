      <h1>Esperance Shire recommends approving Castletown holiday home</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:51:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Dietsch</a></address>
      <p>Despite neighbours being divided, Shire of Esperance staff have recommended council approve an application for a holiday house in Castletown.</p>
      <p>Gregory Hill has applied for a development application to change a 'dwelling' to a 'holiday house' at 4, Cavanagh Court.</p>
      <p>Shire manager of strategic planning Richard Hindley advised council to approve the application subject to conditions.</p>
      <p>There are five properties adjoining the address, with two under the same ownership. Two neighbours expressed support and two objected.</p>
      <p>At a council briefing session on Tuesday, November 19, Mr Hill's neighbour, Jen Pusey, spoke against the proposal.</p>
      <p>Mrs Pusey said she had learned, from past experiences, short term renting was an "unsupervised business" and "rules were wonderful on paper but often ignored".</p>
      <p>These experiences were <b>not</b> related to Mr Hill.</p>
      <p>Mrs Pusey was also concerned the holiday home would cause additional parking that would obstruct traffic.</p>
      <p>Another neighbour, Heather Creedon, told council the area had many elderly residents.</p>
      <p>"Everyone with a holiday let earns good money, but it can be a bane for those that live around and beside them. It has been a nightmare in the past living next door to one," Mrs Creedon said.</p>
      <p>In a written objection she said, "when greed and making money becomes the focus in this sort of enterprise, other people around them suffer and are not financially compensated for the aggravation and stress short term stays in quiet streets present".</p>

      <p>Mr Hill told council he brought the property four to five months ago.</p>
      <p>He admitted he lived in Perth, but said he had businesses in Esperance, spent half of his time here and had nominated his niece to be the primary contact.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill said the house would only be used 30 per cent of the time by holiday makers. He said he and his family would use the house the rest of the time.</p>
      <p>According to the applicant, at least five cars can park on his property, so obstructing traffic was not an issue.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill said Mrs Creedon, lived on a farm and the neighbourhood wasn't her primary residence.</p>
      <p>"Heather, I believe this must be your holiday home," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill said he wanted to reconnect to Castletown Beach, where he'd grown up.</p>
      <p>"It's not about income. There's better ways of making money," he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Hill has promised to limit the number of guests, vet them and impose 'quiet hours' .</p>
      <p>The applicant also said he would not use sites such as Airbnb. Mr Hill told council respect was "utmost" to him.</p>
      <p>Mr Hindley said there were more than 100 holiday homes in the shire and a new policy would address concerns raised.</p>
      <p>He said the proposal was compatible with the surrounding area as long as it was adequately managed and conditions were adhered to.</p>
      <p>Council is set to vote on the matter on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
