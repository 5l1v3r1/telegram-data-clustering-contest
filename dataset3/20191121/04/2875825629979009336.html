      <h1>The Apprentice's Thomas called 'true hero' as he sacrifices himself in boardroom</h1>
      <h2>The Apprentice viewers were left in turmoil following Wednesday's shock boardroom twist and took to social media to gush about Thomas Skinner's heroic move</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:06:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:06</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Boardroom scenes were particularly tense during Wednesday's episode of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/the-apprentice">The Apprentice</a> .</p>
      <p>A shock twist saw Thomas Skinner offer to take Pamela Laird's place in the boardroom firing line when team manager Ryan-Mark Parsons chose her and Marianne Rawlins to face Lord Sugar after the group lost this week's corporate away day task.</p>
      <p>After their team lost by just £15, Thomas shocked Lord Alan Sugar and viewers at home by suggesting he should take another contestant's place in the final three after disagreeing with Ryan-Mark's decision.</p>
      <p>This week's task saw teams organise corporate days away aboard the Belmont British Pullman and arrange food, drinks and entertainment for passengers.</p>

      <p>Luxury womenswear consultant Ryan-Mark said: "At the end of the train journey, I made a speech that I was proud of everyone and I still stand by that because I felt everyone tried their hardest but I will bring back Pamela and Marianne."</p>
      <p>Pamela was instantly disappointed with her team leaders feedback and hit back with a harsh swipe, saying: "That’s a massive mistake."</p>
      <p>After the two battled it out, Thomas demanded he should be brought back into the boardroom instead as he disagreed with Ryan-Mark.</p>
      <p>He offered: "I don’t think you should bring Pamela back."</p>

      <p>Pamela continued to fight her corner, explaining: "I did not fail this task, I think you should rethink your decision Ryan-Mark as I saved this task."</p>
      <p>A confused Lord Sugar questioned Thomas: "Want to take her place?"</p>
      <p>"I’ll take her place, she should not be coming back in this room one hundred per cent," Thomas confirmed.</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark argued: "Okay well on that basis I’ll bring Thomas back if he wants to come back so desperately."</p>
      <p>Thomas managed to remain in the competition and avoid being fired for the seven out of eight tasks of the series so far.</p>
      <p>Project manager Ryan-Mark said his goodbyes as he became the latest contestant to be axed from Lord Sugar's hit show.</p>

      <p>Alan praised Thomas for being "a nice chap" and admitted that he admired his "gallantry," before he chose to give the pillow company owner and Marianne another chance.</p>
      <p>Viewers watched the showdown in turmoil before rushing to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to comment on Thomas' heroic act in a last-ditch attempt to save his teammate.</p>
      <p>One user wrote: "Not all heroes wear capes."</p>
      <p>While another gushed: "TOMMY HAS MY WHOLE HEART STEPPING IN FOR HER YES."</p>
      <p>A third praised: "Tommy really is the nicest guy. He praises where it's due, is always pleased for the winning team and now stepping up for his team mates. So relieved he's still in the process."</p>

      <p>Other users branded Tommy "the hero of the hour" and commended his "chivalry".</p>
      <p>The boardroom's latest casualty Ryan-Mark recently told Mirror Online that co-star Marianne, 36, had a "personal vendetta" against him and branded their relationship "toxic."</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark is now looking forward to the future with his VIP concierge app and hopes for further TV opportunities.</p>
