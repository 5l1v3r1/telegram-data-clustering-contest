      <h1>Mets interview Hensley Meulens for bench-coach job</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:11:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:11</time> by <a rel="author">Ken Davidoff</a></address>
      <p>Add Hensley Meulens to the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/fredi-gonzalez-emerges-as-mets-bench-coach-candidate/">list of candidates for the Mets’ bench coach job.</a></p>
      <p>The former Giants coach interviewed for the spot. He spent 10 years with the recently retired Bruce Bochy in San Francisco, the last two as bench coach. Gabe Kapler, fresh off getting fired in Philadelphia, took over the manager’s job with the Giants after Bochy’s departure.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old Meulens was once a top Yankees prospect and interviewed for the Yankees’ managerial job two years ago before they hired Aaron Boone.</p>
      <p>With Carlos Beltran never having managed or coached before, the Mets are looking for someone with experience — particularly in the National League — for the bench coach position.</p>
      <p>According to a source, they’ve already talked to Jerry Narron, the ex-Reds and Rangers manager who has also been a bench coach with Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Arizona. And former Marlins and Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez is also expected to interview for the position.</p>
