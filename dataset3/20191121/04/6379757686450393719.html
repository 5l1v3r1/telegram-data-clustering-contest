      <p>The improved seed variety which is currently sold at 6,000/-, will be grown at TARI nurseries and given free to farmers across Kigoma Region.</p>
      <p>TARI Director General, Dr Geoffrey Mkamilo made the statement during his visit in Kigoma region to examine production of better oil palm seeds following directives from the prime minister Kassim Majaliwa.</p>
      <p>Dr Mkamilo said: “We have put in place an arrangement where the palm seeds will be delivered at district offices before they are distributed to farmers. We are giving the seeds for free as part of implementation of directives by prime minister who wanted to see increased palm cultivation across the country”.</p>
      <p>Kigoma region agricultural advisor, Joseph Rubuye added that the palm seeds will also be given to public institutions including primary and secondary schools. He said TARI in collaboration with district authorities have started growing the seeds at established nurseries.</p>
      <p>The districts which have established palm seed nurseries are, Kigoma, Kasulu, Kigoma- Ujiji, Kasulu municipal council, Uvinza and Buhigwe. The nurseries are monitored by TARI- Kihinga.</p>
      <p>Rubuye said palm oil is mostly cultivated in Kigoma Ujiji district whereas apart from provided with 36,000 seedlings from TARI, the district authority has purchased another 6,000 from abroad which have been distributed to farmers.</p>
      <p>Director at TARI-Kihinga, Dr Filson Kagimbo said the most challenge that farmers face is low productivity associated with the use poor technology. He said currently farmers get 1.6 tonnes of palm seeds per hectare while their counterparts in Malaysia get between 8 and 9 tonnes per hectare due to use of improved agricultural technology.</p>
      <p>He was recently quoted saying Kigoma has huge potential in increasing palm oil production by using better seeds, adding TARI is conducting research so that they scale up production of oil from 1.6 tonnes per hectare to 3 – 4 tonnes per hectare.</p>
      <p>He said TARI’s three-year plan is to distribute 15 million seedlings, an average of five million seedlings per year, a step that will help reduce government’s cost to import palm oil.</p>
      <p>Over 30,000 smallholder farmers in Kigoma Region generate income from cultivating oil palm trees and extracting and selling palm oil.</p>
      <p>Tanzania has 27 agricultural research institutes specialising in production of quality seeds and improvement of extension services and boosting farm productivity.</p>
