      <p>A YOUNG Bicton girl’s fight for the City of Melville to continue with its plan to build a footpath along her street has succeeded.</p>
      <p>The council voted on Tuesday night to proceed with the $150,000 footpath along the south side of Beach Street, which is intended to connect Point Walter Road to Blackwall Reach.</p>
      <p>Beth Lockwood (11) spoke to the council at the meeting for a second time, imploring them to build the footpath on the basis of community safety.</p>
      <p>Two petitions had previously gone to council asking it to abandon the footpath plans and on Tuesday, Swan Foreshore Protection Association chairman Clive Ross also presented, citing concerns about the effect a footpath would have on driveways.</p>
      <p>Beth was in school yesterday when the Gazette called but her mother Nicole said her daughter was pleased by the decision.</p>
      <p>“She was so happy that lots of the councillors referred to what she spoke about,” she said.</p>
      <p>Councillors were divided on the issue, with it eventually passing 8-5. Some were focused on the need to allow pedestrians to move safely along the street, while others pointed to a perceived lack of community consultation.</p>

      <p>They agreed to include an amendment that people’s crossovers were maintained, and that the council would discuss the removal of a crossover with individual property owners if it was substandard or unapproved.</p>
      <p>The council sent out 75 consultation letters to residents and property owners.</p>
      <p>Construction is scheduled for the end of June.</p>
