      <h4>Sarah Hyland shared a fun moment she had with fiance Wells Adams on Nov. 20 when she posted some pics of herself coming close to suffering a wardrobe malfunction in her dress.</h4>
      <p><a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/celeb/sarah-hyland/"><b>Sarah Hyland</b></a>, 28, poked fun at herself on Nov. 20 when she posted some photos that showed her coming close to a wardrobe malfunction! The <i>Modern Family</i> star was spending some time on a cruise with her fiance <b>Wells Adams</b>, 35, in Paris, France when the pics were taken and although her black sparkly low-cut dress had nearly slipped off in the snapshots, she enjoyed a gorgeous view of water and the Eiffel Tower in the background, which led to a lot of laughs. “A girl, a view, and a questionable wardrobe malfunction: A Series 📸: @wellsadams,” she captioned the pics.</p>
      <p>Sarah’s followers couldn’t help but comment on her funny yet gorgeous pics, and that included Wells! The hunk shared his support for his fiancee by leaving her a drooling emoji and it set the tone for a lot of other responses. “Sooo beautiful!! 😘❤️👑,” one read. “Hahahaha adorable!!! 😂👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,” another gushed. “You look lovely,” a third compliment read.</p>
      <p>Before her latest photos, Sarah turned heads at the <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/10/sarah-hyland-peoples-choice-awards-2019-dress-photos/">People’s Choice Awards</a> on Nov. 10 when she showed off a figure-flattering orange gown. It was designed by <b>Fausto Puglisi </b>and had a thigh-high slit that helped her show off her long legs. She paired the look with some eye-catching makeup, including lipstick that matched the color of her dress and dark eyeshadow with lengthening mascara that helped to make her gorgeous eyes stand out.</p>
