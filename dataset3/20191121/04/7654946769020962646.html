      <h1>Democratic debates: Arrow pointing up for a couple of long-shots</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:56:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author">Eric Soufer</a></address>
      <p>The political fireworks mostly stayed in Washington, D.C. as a dozen Democratic candidates assembled in Atlanta for their two-plus hour-long debate — where the top-tier Democratic candidates largely avoided sharp and personal exchanges that could redefine the race.</p>
      <p>That means that Pete Buttigieg’s momentum — fueled by strong polling in Iowa and New Hampshire — will likely continue unabated, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren made the most of her early time to lay out her big plans and offer the personal anecdotes that have endeared her to liberal activists.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sen. Cory Booker</b>
      </p>
      <p>Managed to smartly hit Biden on marijuana and positioned himself as a Wall Street-friendly alternative to Warren at the start, which was a must to attract the donor dollars he desperately needs. It might be enough to resuscitate his campaign and keep him going into December.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Up</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rep. Tulsi Gabbard</b>
      </p>
      <p>Exposed by Sen. Harris and Mayor Pete as an Obama-hating Trump Democrat. That’s fatal in a Democratic primary. With any luck, this was the last Democrats will be forced to hear from Tulsi Gabbard on a debate stage.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Down</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sen. Amy Klobuchar</b>
      </p>
      <p>Projected thoughtful, hard-earned leadership experience, with a powerful appeal to everyday Americans and anyone who cares about electing the first woman president.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Up</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mayor Pete Buttigieg</b>
      </p>
      <p>Debates aren’t his best format, but he met his primary objective, which was do no harm. If undecided voters were looking for flashes of brilliance, they got it. But if they wanted a commanding performance by the latest frontrunner, they’ll need to wait a little longer.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Sideways</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sen. Elizabeth Warren</b>
      </p>
      <p>She got more airtime at the start than anyone else and used the time effectively to drive home her most sweeping plans. Plus, she had the night’s best impeachment takedown. But she doubled down on a wealth tax plan that might be causing her poll numbers to slip.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Up</p>
      <p>
        <b>Former Vice President Joe Biden</b>
      </p>
      <p>He was painful to watch as the truly extraordinary gaffes continued  from “I come out of the black community,” to trumpeting an endorsement from “the only black woman ever elected to the senate,” to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/democratic-debate-joe-biden-says-we-need-to-keep-punching-at-domestic-violence/">bizarrely caveating violence against women</a> — but the impact has likely dulled. Eventually, he’ll need to get it together, but November 2019 isn’t that time.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Sideways</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sen. Bernie Sanders</b>
      </p>
      <p>Analysis: Still kinetic behind a microphone and still feels more authentic than any other progressive on the debate stage. But he inexplicably got very little airtime, which reduced his upside substantially.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Sideways</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sen. Kamala Harris</b>
      </p>
      <p>It won’t be enough to catapult her from the middle of the pack, but she got good hits on Trump’s failed North Korea strategy and the need for Democrats to build an Obama coalition. Plus, her takedown of Gabbard was probably the most satisfying moment for progressives across the country.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Up</p>
      <p>
        <b>Andrew Yang</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now that his 15 minutes are up, he seems uninterested in even preparing for these debates. With the first caucuses now two months away, his supporters will see performances like this and begin to look for a more serious candidate.</p>
      <p>Arrow: Down</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tom Steyer</b>
      </p>
      <p>Made a perfect argument he should drop out and go back to doing what he’s good at — spending money to elect down-ballot Democratic candidates who can actually win. Oh, and he was exposed as a former coal investor.</p>
