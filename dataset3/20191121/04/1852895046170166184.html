      <h1>Pete Buttigieg Slams Tulsi Gabbard: ‘I Wouldn’t Sit Down With Assad, A Murderous Dictator’</h1>

      <h4>Pete Buttigieg got the last word during a spat with Tulsi Gabbard on the Democratic debate stage, deriding the Hawaii Rep. for meeting with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.</h4>
      <p>The move of the night at the fifth Democratic debate was attacking <b>Tulsi Gabbard</b>, the controversial congresswoman from Hawaii who once <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2016/11/21/who-is-tulsi-gabbard-donald-trump-cabinet-politician/">aligned herself</a> with <b>Donald Trump</b>. Things came to a head when she sparred with <b>Pete Buttigieg</b> about his lack of foreign affairs experience, as he has only served as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. Gabbard honed in on a remark Buttigieg recently made about being willing to <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article237463004.html">send US troops to Mexico</a>. “That is outlandish, even by the standards of today’s politics,” a visibly irked Buttigieg responded. “Do you seriously think anybody on this stage is proposing invading Mexico? …I’m talking about building alliances.”</p>
      <p>Gabbard went on to say that Buttigieg would “lack the courage” to meet with dictators, as the Trump administration is currently doing, juggling lukewarm relationships with North Korea’s<b> Kim Jong Un</b>, Syria’s<b> Bashar al-Assad</b>, and, of course, Russia’s <b>Vladimir Putin. Buttigieg </b>had a whip-smart and short response: “I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator,” he told the congresswoman, referencing her meeting with Assad in Syria, in 2017. After the meeting, which she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0jnKb8MDks&amp;feature=emb_title">recently told</a> <b>Stephen Colbert</b> was in “pursuit of peace and security,” Gabbard expressed skepticism about Assad’s use of chemical warfare on his own people; the US government and the United Nations both say there is substantial evidence that Assad did so, and should be classified a war criminal.</p>
      <p>Gabbard has contended that meeting with figures like Assad is essential, as the US must be “willing to meet with adversaries.” Maybe… just not that one? California Senator<b> Kamala Harris</b> honed in on this during a spat with Gabbard earlier in the evening, as well, saying the congresswoman “fails to call a war criminal by what he is — a war criminal.” Gabbard called the senator’s talking point ” lies and smears.”</p>

      <p>What all three candidates could agree on, however, is that Trump needs to be beaten in 2020. Their colleague, Minnesota Senator <b>Amy Klobuchar</b>, delivered one of the quotes of the night when <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/20/amy-klobuchar-nancy-pelosi-beats-trump-every-day-female-president/">she said</a>, “If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, <b>Nancy Pelosi</b> does it every day.” They can’t deny that one.</p>
