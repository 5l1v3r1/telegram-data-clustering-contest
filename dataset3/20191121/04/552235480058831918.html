      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/shopping">Woolworths</a> is the store the nation would most like to have back on the high street.</p>
      <p>Six in 10 adults voted it as being the biggest loss.</p>
      <p>Woolies, which went bust 10 years ago, was loved for selling a wide variety of goods including pick ’n’ mix treats, kids’ clothes and toys, pots, pans and CDs.</p>
      <p>Toys R Us was second on the list with one in five voting for it.</p>
      <p>The next most missed chains were department store bhs and clothes retailers Jane Norman and C&amp;A.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But shoppers seem to be glad to see the back of electrical store Comet.</p>
      <p>It received no votes in the survey of 2,424 Brits.</p>
      <p>Online marketplace OnBuy, which carried out the poll, said: “The survey comprised shops that have faced administrators and subsequent closures and required respondents to select the shop they wish they could bring back in time for Christmas.”</p>
      <p>Book store Borders, furniture chain MFI, Tie Rack and video rental shop Blockbuster were missed by a small percentage of people.</p>
