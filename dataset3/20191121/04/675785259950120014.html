      <p>A bride who was 'dreading' trying on a wedding dress lost an incredible eight stone by cutting one thing from her diet.</p>
      <p>Kylie Mulcahy, 30, decided to shed the pounds because she feared her size 20 frame would not fit into a white gown.</p>
      <p>Ms Mulcahy, from Wollongong, near Sydney, Australia, was 120kg at her heaviest, although her weight plummeted after changing her exercise routine and eating habits.</p>
      <p>When she finally started visiting bridal shops in 2018 she slipped into her size eight dress with ease.</p>
      <p>The bride, who wed her husband in 2019, has now revealed that the key to her weight loss was ditching dairy from her diet.</p>

      <p>She told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7704161/Bride-30-dreaded-trying-wedding-dress-loses-55-kilos-just-12-months.html">Daily Mail</a> : "I remember thinking if I ever got married the thought of walking into a wedding dress shop would scare me because I would never fit into anything, the people would judge me.</p>
      <p>"But when I went into a store a year after losing all of the weight and I could pretty much wear any of them, it was a great feeling.</p>
      <p>"I was exercising with a personal trainer at the gym in 2016 - who wrote me a diet plan filled with protein and vegetables - and I still wasn't able to lose weight."</p>
      <p>Ms Mulcahy began gaining weight in her 20s, even though she led a healthy life.</p>
      <p>She lost the first 15kg with meal replacement shakes and Lite N' Easy healthy dishes.</p>
      <p>However, she started shedding the serious pounds after being diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome in 2017.</p>
      <p>A nutritionist told her to cut out dairy and gluten to help deal with her insulin levels.</p>

      <p>Her new low carb and sugar diet, combined with a exercise routine inspired by YouTube workout videos, resulted in her dramatic weight loss.</p>
      <p>When she finally went wedding dress shopping, she was overwhelmed with relief after falling in love with the first gown she tried on.</p>
      <p>The bride said: "It's so cool to be able to try something on and have it fit perfectly."</p>
      <p>She added that her aunties burst into tears and said she looked beautiful when they saw her on her wedding day in March.</p>
