      <h1>Biden forgets Harris exists</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:02:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/max-greenwood" target="_blank">Max Greenwood</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> claimed at the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday that his 2020 bid had been endorsed by the only black woman ever elected to the U.S. Senate.</p>
      <p>The only problem? Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> (D-Calif.), another black woman and rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, was standing just a few feet away from him. And she certainly hasn't offered Biden her endorsement.</p>
      <p>"I'm right here!" Harris said, throwing up her arms before breaking out in laughter along with the rest of the debate audience.</p>

      <p>Biden's presidential bid has been endorsed by former Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/person/carol-moseley-braun">Carol Moseley Braun</a> (D-Ill.), the first black woman to be elected to the U.S. Senate. </p>
      <p>Harris became the second black woman elected to the Senate in 2016, a fact that Biden seemingly overlooked on Wednesday as he touted his support from black voters. </p>
      <p>Harris is of mixed ancestry, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and from India.</p>
      <p>Harris was quick to point out the oversight on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"Proud to be the second Black woman elected to the U.S. Senate. #DemDebate" the senator tweeted.</p>
