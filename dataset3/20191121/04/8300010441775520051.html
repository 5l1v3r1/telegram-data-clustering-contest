      <p>ATLANTA -- South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg defended his lack of national experience by punctuating his executive experience, albeit in a city of roughly 100,000 people.<br/><br/>He said during Wednesday night's debate that his isn't traditional establishment experience but that "I would argue we need something very different right now."<br/><br/>But Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar repeated her argument that, were Buttigieg a woman, he would not be on the debate stage as a top-tier candidate for president.<br/><br/>Klobuchar has been arguing that her trove of passed legislation is proof of pragmatism, and victory in conservative parts of Minnesota proof she can beat President Donald Trump.<br/><br/>She said, "What I said is true," adding, "Otherwise, we could play a game called name your favorite woman president."</p>
