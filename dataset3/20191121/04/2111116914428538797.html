      <p>Such a portable machine, after all, is vital if you’re a musician or a professional DJ. You need one of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-processors"><u>best processors</u></a> and plenty of fast RAM, first of all, to smoothly tackle multiple music tracks at a time. And, you’ll also require a fast and spacious storage drive – or a dual drive comprised of both an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-solid-state-drives-ssds"><u>SSD</u></a> and a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/10-best-internal-desktop-and-laptop-hard-disk-drives-2016"><u>hard drive</u></a> should be plenty – to save your massive music files in.</p>
      <p>And, especially if you’re on the road a lot, you might even need a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-rugged-laptops"><u>laptop that's rugged</u></a> as well as light and thin like an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-ultrabook-18-top-thin-and-lights-1054355"><u>Ultrabook</u></a> so that it can take a beating or two and is extremely portable.</p>
      <p>The best thing about shopping around for the best laptop to DJs is that your options are practically limitless. The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/macbook-pro"><u>MacBook Pro</u></a> may be the default for most musicians, but that doesn’t mean that one that runs <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/software/operating-systems/windows-10-1267364/review"><u>Windows 10</u></a> won’t be ideal for you.</p>
      <p>And, on that note, we put together a list of the best laptops of your music production needs. This way, you won’t have to scour the laptop market and get overwhelmed with a ton of choices.

      <p>The most powerful MacBook ever made</p>
      <p><b>CPU: </b>6-core Intel Core i7 - i9 | <b>Graphics: </b>AMD Radeon Pro 555X – Radeon Pro Vega 20 | <b>RAM: </b>16 - 32GB | <b>Screen: </b>15.4-inch, 2,880 x 1,800 Retina display | <b>Storage: </b>256GB - 4TB SSD</p>

      <p>+ Powerful <br/>+ Gorgeous design <br/>-  Expensive </p>
      <p>For years, the MacBook Pro has been the go-to laptop for musicians all over the world, and its 2019 refresh follows in those footsteps. Actually, it fits the bill even more. If you can justify the price of entry, the MacBook Pro is without a doubt the best laptop for music production, particularly if you’re already invested in the macOS ecosystem. With its 9th-generation Intel Core chips and up to 32GB of RAM, you’ll be able to load up as many tracks as you want in Logic Pro X without crippling your laptop or have it suffer slowdowns. It’s also surprisingly robust – you won’t have to worry about things bumping into it in your tour bag or dropping it a couple of times. This is because Apple has designed their MacBooks with a sturdy aluminum chassis that can survive hard falls and bangs.</p>

      <p>+ Centered webcam<br/>+ Battery life better than ever<br/>+ Beautiful optional 4K display<br/>- 2019 update isn't huge<br/>- Expensive</p>
      <p>The Dell XPS 13 has had our vote as one of the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/best-laptops-1304361"><u> best laptops</u></a> on the market for a few years running, so it’s no surprise that its successor, the newly-released 2019 model is no different. For budding music producers, the XPS’ move to an 8th-generation Intel Core chips should be alluring, as it will cut the time it takes to process tracks, making your creative process more streamlined and time-saving, which gives you more time to dedicate on other things. What’s even better, the 1TB storage drive configuration is back, which means you’ll have more storage space than ever to save your large files in.</p>

      <p>If you need a bigger and more powerful laptop for running music production software on, the Dell XPS 15 might just be the best laptop to meet your needs. Touting the same InfinityEdge technology as the smaller XPS 13, the screen extends right to the edge of the machine, which means that this laptop is as small as it’s possible to fashion a 15-inch laptop. It's indeed pricey, depending on which version you get. However, the very top end configuration has a 4K color-accurate display, which gives you a brilliant overview of all the tracks you're working on.</p>
