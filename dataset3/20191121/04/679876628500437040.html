      <h3>MEDITERRANEAN MARVELS</h3>
      <p>Viking, which recently launched its sixth ocean ship, Viking Jupiter, has combined some of its existing itineraries to offer six new ocean cruises for 2021 that cover many of the highlights of the Mediterranean and include a brand-new port of call for the company, Istanbul. Among the cruises is a 15-day Ancient Adriatic Treasures itinerary between Venice and Istanbul, a 22-day Adriatic &amp; Mediterranean Sojourn between Rome and Istanbul, and an extended 29-day Mediterranean's Iconic Shores cruise from Barcelona to Istanbul that visits France, Monaco, Italy, Croatia, Montenegro, Greece and Turkey.</p>

      <h3>SAIL AWAY</h3>
      <p>Sea Cloud Cruises has completed the first sea worthiness tests on its third tall ship, Sea Cloud Spirit, which is on track to make its maiden voyage on August 29, 2020. The three-masted, fully-rigged sailing ship will accommodate 136 guests, with 25 of its outer cabins having balconies. The interior design reflects classic yacht style, with plenty of outdoor space, a spa and wellness concept and – for the first time on a sailing ship – a lift to connect decks. There will also be a choice of fine- and casual-dining restaurants on the lido deck.</p>

      <h3>FUN IN FIJI</h3>
      <p>Captain Cook Cruises Fiji has released new departure dates for its 11-night Lau &amp; Kadavu Discovery Cruise, which explores a region of Fiji less visited by tourists. Highlights include a visit to the former leper colony of Makogai Island, the rugged coastlines and waterfalls of Taveuni, and Qilaqila, known for its pristine waters, limestone caves and mushroom-shaped islands. There are also plenty of opportunities to swim and snorkel among coral and giant clams, as well as scuba-dive daily. The new departures are October 20, 2020 and March 16, 2021.</p>

      <h3>ARCTIC HIGHS</h3>
      <p>Silversea recently traversed the Northeast Passage for the first time when Silver Explorer sailed between Nome in Alaska and Tromso in Norway via the Russian Arctic. The ship will tackle the legendary route again next year on a 25-day journey departing Nome on August 22, 2020 that takes guests through the stunning landscapes of Alaska, Russia and Norway. Meanwhile Silver Cloud will sail an almost concurrent 24-day voyage through the Northwest Passage when it departs from Kangerlussuaq in Greenland on  August 21, 2020 for a voyage via Greenland, Canada and Alaska that concludes in Nome.</p>

      <h3>TURKISH DELIGHT</h3>
      <p>Seabourn has announced a return to Istanbul in October 2020 on the line's newest ship, Seabourn Ovation, which will sail four seven-day eastern Mediterranean voyages between Istanbul and Athens (or the reverse) that explore the Greek islands and Turkish coastline. A Turkish &amp; Aegean Treasures itinerary departing Istanbul on October 17 and 31, 2020 visits Myrina, Rhodes, Santorini and Spetses in Greece, then sails Turkey's coast before concluding in Athens. Two other cruises departing October 10 and 24 visit Patmos, Crete, Mykonos and Skiathos, as well as Bozcaada and Kusadasi in Turkey, before finishing in Istanbul.</p>
