      <h1>Booker rips Biden on marijuana: ‘I thought you might have been high when you said it’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:14:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:14</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker clocked former Vice President Joe Biden over his opposition to marijuana legalization during the Democratic debate on MSNBC on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Biden broke from the rest of the 2020 Democratic field in announcing that he <u><a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/biden-bucks-2020-front-runners-by-opposing-marijuana-legalization">opposed marijuana legalization</a></u> because he believes it’s a “gateway drug.”</p>
      <p>Booker, 50, questioned how Biden, 77, could claim to be the candidate for black voters when he is opposed to marijuana legalization. Booker said, “This week I hear him literally say I don’t think we should legalize marijuana. I thought you might have been high when you said it.”</p>
      <p>His line drew laughter from the crowd. Booker noted that marijuana is “already legal for privileged people” but lands many black men in prisons.</p>
      <p>“And let me tell you because marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people. The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people,” Booker said, later adding, “There are people in Congress right now that admit to smoking marijuana, while there are people — our kids are in jail right now for those drug crimes.”</p>
      <p>Biden countered Booker’s criticisms by explaining that he supports decriminalization and would expunge the records of those arrested on marijuana charges.</p>
      <p>“I think we should decriminalize marijuana period, and I think anyone who has a record should be let out of jail, their record expunged, be completely zeroed out. But I do think it makes sense based on data that we should study what the long-term effects are for the use of marijuana,” Biden said. “That’s all it is.”</p>
