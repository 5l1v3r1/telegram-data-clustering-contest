      <p>The Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) have destroyed imported frozen poultry products seized by CGC Strike Force.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Comptroller, Yahaya B.U stated that the seizures of 1,393 cartons of frozen poultry products seized early this month by his team with a Duty Paid Value (DPV) of  N13,372,800.00.</p>
      <p>Yahaya said the seizure of the smuggled frozen poultry products was owed to a combination of the Unit’s intelligence and Enforcement capacity.</p>
      <p>He said smugglers were getting sophisticated and the customs has devised means that are more sophisticated in order to counter them and renewed effort to give smugglers a run for their money.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Comptroller said it was very obvious that with the border closure, creeks would be their next options, but the officers are keeping vigil as the command will continue the onslaught until the smugglers retreat.</p>
      <p>Yahaya reiterated that the community relationship between the officers and villages along the coast has been of benefit to the success and it has come to stay.He added that the availability of operations tools and personnel motivation instills prompt response in the men whenever any alert was raised.</p>
      <p>He said the frozen poultry products totaling 1,393 cartons were being smuggled and conveyed in 10 vehicles.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, he said the NCS maintains that the importation of frozen poultry products remained prohibited and that destruction of the products was in compliance with the Federal Government’s policy on imported poultry products.</p>
      <p>Also, the Strike-Force Team in charge of Zone B, in Kano displayed N210million seized contraband items ranging from second clothing’s, foreign rice, vegetable oil, used shoes and cars.</p>
      <p>The  National Coordinator, Zone B of the CGC Strike Force, Kano/Jigawa Customs Command, Deputy Comptroller Baba Kura Kolobe, said the seizures were made at different times along Kano and Jigawa border axis.</p>
      <p>He said two suspected notorious smugglers were arrested during the operations and will soon be charged to court for prosecution.</p>

      <p>Kolobe said the team made over 44 numbers of seizures within some months, including over 1702 bags of foreign rice, with a duty paid value of N38 million.</p>
      <p>Also, over 5,661 jerrycans of foreign vegetable oil with a duty paid value of N75.6 million, 1,285 sacks and 192 cartons of foreign shoes estimated at N47.6 million were intercepted.</p>
      <p>Other contraband goods seized include 819 bails of second hand clothes valued at N31.7 million, 19 sacks of used shoes estimated at N1, 225, 925 million, 51 sacks of local beans estimated at N1, 071, 000m.</p>
      <p>Also impounded by the CGC Strike Force include 827 bags of foreign mosquito coil valued at N5.3 million, 26 units of used vehicles estimated at N11.2 million, seven bags of Basmatic rice valued at N77, 385.</p>
      <p>Other seized items include  100 pieces of used tyres valued at N395, 200, 28 cartons of foreign macaroni valued at N108, 360, 825m cartons of foreign soap with a duty paid value of N6 million, two bags of foreign sugar estimated at N26, 400, 180m cartons of foreign spaghetti at the cost of N969, 600.</p>
      <p>According to him, the latest closure of the border by the Federal Government has yielded positive results as customs in collaboration with sister security agents have continued to clampdown on smugglers and saboteurs of the nation’s economy.</p>
      <p>DC Kolobe also appealed to relevant authorities to provide more warehouses where the seized items would be stocked as both the packing store and open spaces in Kano/Jigawa Customs Command are filled up.</p>
