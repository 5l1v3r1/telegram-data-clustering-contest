      <p>MADRID (Reuters) - Australia retired one game into their doubles dead rubber against Belgium at the Davis Cup Finals, placing the revamped tournament under further scrutiny a day after Canada forfeited a doubles rubber against the United States.</p>

      <p>With a scheduling logjam pushing matches past midnight for a second successive day, Australia won both their singles against Belgium to seal a quarter-final clash against Canada but had little motivation to try for a sweep in the early hours of Thursday.</p>
      <p>Australia’s John Peers and Jordan Thompson did take the court for the Group D doubles rubber but walked off after claiming the opening game.</p>
      <p>Belgium, knocked out of the tournament, were given a 6-0 6-0 win by organisers.</p>
      <p>Tennis Australia tweeted that Peers had “wrist injury concerns” but captain Lleyton Hewitt later said the doubles specialist had a sore elbow.</p>
      <p>“It was an easy decision for me because I’m not risking him before we have a quarter-final match tomorrow,” Hewitt told reporters.</p>
      <p>“He’ll be getting treatment tonight and icing it. Hopefully it pulls up well for tomorrow night.”</p>
      <p>Canada forfeited their doubles rubber in Tuesday’s Group F clash against the United States, also after winning both singles rubbers.</p>
      <p>“Three of the Canadian players were passed unfit to the play the doubles,” organisers the ITF said at the time.</p>
      <p>With the two best runners-up in the six groups joining the group winners in the quarter-finals, the United States stood to benefit from being effectively gifted the two 6-0 sets.</p>
      <p>But the Americans were ultimately knocked out despite beating Italy 2-1, with their three-set victory in the deciding doubles rubber finishing after 4 a.m. local time (0300 GMT).</p>
      <p>Before the United States-Italy match, world No. 2 Novak Djokovic said it was unfair the Americans had been awarded a 6-0 6-0 win by forfeit.</p>
      <p>“I think everyone should be obliged to come out and play, at least play,” he said after Serbia beat Japan 3-0.</p>
      <p>Britain’s Andy Murray agreed.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think that’s good. I was saying I felt like one of the positive things to the way the group stages work is that all of the matches are live, there isn’t any dead rubbers.</p>
      <p>“So where Canada may have felt that that was a dead rubber in theory for them because they were already through, that could have implications to all of the teams potentially that might finish in second place.</p>
      <p>“Also they would have had two days off as well after that so I think they should have played the tie.”</p>
      <p>Canada will face Australia in the first quarter-final later on Thursday, with the benefit of an extra day’s rest compared to their opponents.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, there’s not a lot we can do, really,” said Hewitt.</p>
      <p>“At least they’re on a night schedule, they should be used to it.”</p>
      <p>The best second-placed nations are decided first on matches won, then individual rubbers, then sets and then games.</p>
