      <p>Vice President Guvheya Constantino Chiwenga’s Wikipedia profile claimed yesterday that he died on the 18th of November at a Chinese military hospital.</p>
      <p>The profile has since been updated to show that Chiwenga  is not dead. His academic qualifications(Ph.D in Genocide) have also been updated to Political Science.</p>
      <p>This latest mishap will fuel speculation on the former general’s future following rumours that he is planning to takeover from Mnangagwa when he returns from Beijing.</p>
