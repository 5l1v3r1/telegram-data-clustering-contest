      <p>Twitter said it will start <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/twitter-says-it-will-let-all-users-hide-replies-to-tweets">letting all users hide replies to the tweets they send</a>, an effort to improve the health of discussions and interactions on the service. From a report:<i> The company has been testing the feature since summer in different markets, including the U.S. and Japan, but is now rolling it out globally. The tool lets users hide specific comments made on their posts, meaning those comments won't be visible to other users unless they click a button to reveal them. The change provides a degree of control that could be used to keep spammers away, or to hide hateful or inappropriate replies.</i></p>
