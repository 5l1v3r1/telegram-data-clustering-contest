      <h3>Week 13 College Fantasy Football DFS Picks: QBs</h3>
      <p><b>Best Start: Jalen Hurts, Oklahoma vs. TCU ($9,000).</b>Hurts has been on of the best DFS quarterbacks this entire season, averaging 44 fantasy points per game and only scoring fewer than 36 fantasy points once. TCU will be a tough matchup, but Hurts is a must-start and should have another big game, making him especially valuable if he's faded by others because of the matchup.</p>
      <p><b>Best Value: Charlie Brewer, Baylor vs. Texas ($7,900).</b> Brewer has been great for DFS players this season, scoring at least 20 points in all but one game. He is coming off a four-TD, 33-fantasy-point performance against Oklahoma, and he should be looking forward to an easier matchup this week with Texas. The Longhorns are ranked 110th in total defense, which will provide Brewer with plenty of opportunities to extended his scoring streak.</p>
      <p><b>Best Sleeper: Jordan McCloud, South Florida vs. Memphis ($5,900).</b>McCloud has been solid since taking over for injured starter Blake Barnett and seems to be getting more comfortable. This week the Bulls host the high-scoring Memphis Tigers and will need a big game out of McCloud if they hope to keep pace.</p>

      <h3>Week 13 College Fantasy Football DFS Picks: RBs</h3>
      <p><b>Best Start: Max Borghi, Washington State vs. Oregon State ($8,000).</b> Borghi has been very impressive this season, catching and rushing his way to 1,164 yards and 12 TDs. He should he in for another big game this week as the Cougars play host to Oregon State and their 102nd-ranked defense.</p>
      <p><b>Best Value: Joshua Kelley, UCLA at USC ($6,700).</b>Kelley was not able to find much running room in Week 12 against Utah’s top-ranked run defense, managing just 78 yards on 19 carries. However, this week he gets to face aUSCdefense allowing more than 167 yards per game on the ground. Look for the Bruins to feed Kelley early and often in this PAC-12 rivalry game.</p>
      <p><b>Best Sleeper: Greg McCrae, UCF at Tulane ($5,200</b>). McCrae had been handling a huge chunk of the UCF rushing load before being injured in Week 8. He is expected to return this weekend against Tulane, who are currently allowing 161 rushing yards per game. Even splitting carries, McCrae should be able put up solid numbers in this matchup.</p>
      <h3>Week 13 College Fantasy Football DFS Picks: WRs</h3>
      <p><b>Best Start: Ja’Marr Chase, LSU vs. Arkansas ($8,100).</b>Chase has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the Tiger’s new offense, rolling up 1,116 yards and 13 TDs over nine games. A 29-fantasy-point-per-game average and a game against a bad Arkansas defense makes for one of the best Week 13 matchup combos. Chase is primed to get his seventh 100-yard game of the season.</p>
      <p><b>Best Value: Easop Winston, Washington State vs. Oregon State ($7,300).</b>Washington State boasts the best passing offense in the country, and Winston is one of QB Aaron Gordon’s primary targets. Through 10 games Winston has turned 70 receptions into 826 yards and 11 TDs. He is coming off a two-game stretch with 20 receptions, 220 yards and two TDs. Winston should be in for another big night as the Cougars face a very bad Oregon State pass defense.</p>
      <p><b>Best Sleeper: Chatarius Atwell, Louisville vs. Syracuse ($5,900).</b> Atwell has had a monster season so far for the Cardinals, catching 52 passes for 920 yards and nine TDs. He has scored at least 21 fantasy points in five of the past six games and this week should be no different. Syracuse is currently ranked 94th in the country in pass defense and will have its hands full trying to keep Atwell contained. The sophomore has a great chance to get over 1,000 yards for the season with a big game this weekend.</p>
