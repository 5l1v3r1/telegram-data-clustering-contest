      <p>Former <b>After School </b>member and former '<b>Produce 48</b>' contestant <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/kaeun">Kaeun</a> will be kicking off her acting career soon, after being cast as the female lead of a new web drama airing next year!</p>
      <p>Kaeun has been cast in the role of <b>Lee Ri Ah</b> in a web drama titled '<b>Another Peaceful Day in Secondhand Nation</b>' (literal translation). The romantic comedy revolves around individuals who buy and sell goods on an online secondhand sales/exchange platform. Kaeun's character Lee Ri Ah is a popular beauty surrounded by men, but she isn't quite interesting in serious dating. </p>
      <p>Back in July of this year, Kaeun left her debut label <b>Pledis Entertainment </b>to seek new opportunities under a new agency, <b>High Entertainment</b>. Look forward to Kaeun's web drama 'Another Peaceful Day in Secondhand Nation', airing in 2020!</p>
