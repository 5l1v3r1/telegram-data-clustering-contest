      <h3>Willian will snub the offer of a new contract from Chelsea FC before January as he explores the possibility of a move to FC Barcelona, according to reports in Spain.</h3>
      <p>Spanish outlet <i>Mundo Deportivo</i>, as quoted by the <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/willian-snub-chelsea-contract-offer-20916994">Daily Star</a>, is reporting that the Brazilian playmaker will not be signing a new contract with Chelsea FC before the mid-season transfer window.</p>
      <p>Willian’s current deal at Chelsea FC is set to expire at the end of the season and that means that he will be free to discuss a pre-contract arrangement with foreign clubs come January.</p>
      <p>The story says that Willian will turn down any offer of a new deal from Chelsea FC before he has seen what FC Barcelona may put on the table in the January window.</p>
      <p>According to the same article, the Spanish club have already seen a number of bids rejected for Willian, with Chelsea FC reportedly turning down a £55m-plus offer back in 2018.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old has been in good form for Chelsea FC in recent weeks, having scored two goals and made three assists in 11 Premier League games so far this season.</p>
      <p>Willian will be hoping to feature for Chelsea FC when the Blues return to Premier League action with a trip to Manchester City on Saturday night.</p>
