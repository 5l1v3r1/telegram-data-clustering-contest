      <h1>NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde need new leadership after super hospital failings</h1>
      <h2>Queen Elizabeth University Hospital was not ready when it opened in 2015</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-health-board-not-fit-20894432"> NHS</a> is this country’s most cherished institution and loved by all generations.</p>
      <p>However, when things go wrong in the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/health-secretary-told-come-clean-20743011">health service</a>, politicians must step up and make the necessary changes.</p>
      <p>It now seems beyond argument that the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/death-toddler-glasgow-super-hospital-20899713">Queen Elizabeth University Hospital</a> (QEUH) should not have opened in 2015.</p>
      <p>The ventilation was not right and the water system would later become a major problem for patients.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/jeane-freeman-confirms-glasgow-super-20913819">Milly Main, a ten-year-old cancer patient</a>, was in remission when she contracted a water infection. The bacteria caused her death.</p>

      <p>As Health Secretary Jeane Freeman makes clear today, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s handling of this case has been “appalling”.</p>
      <p>The board never explained Milly’s death to her parents, the report which flagged up the water link to her case was not shared with Minsters, and NHSGGC turned on the whistleblower.</p>
      <p>Freeman has declined to put this awful health board into special measure, but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/anas-sarwar-tells-nicola-sturgeon-20880776">NHSGGC</a> has clearly been put on notice.</p>
      <p>Our view is clear. Patient engagement in a number of cases has been so poor that it warrants the resignation of senior figures at the board.</p>
      <p>People must have faith that the QEUH is a safe place for their loved ones to be treated, but trust has gone.</p>
      <p>NHSGGC needs new leadership before the reputation of this £842million is so damaged that it cannot be repaired.</p>
      <h3>Scots voters need reassured</h3>
      <p>Gordon Brown is warning of double-trouble ahead with “hyper-austerity” to follow if <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nicola-sturgeon-warns-nigel-farage-20862227">Brexit and Scottish independence</a> go ahead.</p>
      <p>He warns that the cost for Scotland if Britain leaves Europe, and Scotland leaves Britain will be even more cuts and a much smaller Scottish economy.</p>
      <p>Even the government’s own figures show that any kind of Brexit would be bad for the economy and if Brexit goes wrong and we end up with a No Deal then we will have hyper-austerity.</p>

      <p>The same risks, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown-says-cross-party-18999661">Brown argues</a>, lie on the road to independence if it became a messy divorce.</p>
      <p>Nicola Sturgeon argued yesterday that Scotish independence would be nothing like the mess the Tory government has made of Brexit.</p>
      <p>That may be true - but Sturgeon needs to reassure voters that her vision of independence is achievable without making life worse for ordinary Scots.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/lewis-capaldi-gets-top-celebrate-20920507">Lewis Capaldi</a> greeted the news he had been nominated for a Grammy in typical style.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/lewis-capaldi-nominated-grammy-award-20922436">Someone You Loved</a> singer posted bleary-eyed snaps of himself staring out from under a duvet.</p>
      <p>For all his global success, Lewis is still a down-to-earth guy from West Lothian - and that’s why we love him.</p>
