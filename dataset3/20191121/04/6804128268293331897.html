      <h1>Chelsea news: Jose Mourinho's Spurs move, Jadon Sancho's hint, transfer ban latest</h1>
      <h2>The latest news from Stamford Bridge</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>While their rivals have decided to use the international break to chop and change managers, it has been a pretty quiet one for Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The Blues went into the two week hiatus in third place in the Premier League table, joint on points with second placed Leicester City, meaning it has been so far a successful return to Stamford Bridge for Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>The team's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace last weekend means that they have now won six league games in a row, which is perfect preparation for the match coming up after the international break.</p>
      <p>Chelsea travel to the Etihad Stadium to take on reigning Premier League Champions, Manchester City, in a mouthwatering fixture. Pep Guardiola's men are currently one point and one place behind the Blues in the table, in the fourth and last Champions League spot.</p>
      <p>As preparations for the match start to take shape, check out the latest news from Stamford Bridge over the last 24 hours.</p>
