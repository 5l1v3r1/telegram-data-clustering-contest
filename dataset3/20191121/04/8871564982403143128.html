      <h1>Being Andrea: Singapore’s first transgender model on finding herself (Video)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:27:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Few stories of transgender women or men surface in Singapore, and it’s even rarer to read about one who is a model. </p>
      <p>Andrea, 28, is signed to the Phantom modeling agency in Singapore and normally works with brands that are inclusive. She is also a makeup artist and runs a business selling hair weaves.</p>
      <p>But life wasn’t all fantastic for Andrea prior to her reassignment surgery. Growing up, she had always felt there was something off about her, but held out and led a life as a Singaporean man — even serving in the army — until she decided at 23 to take her first hormone pill. </p>
      <p>“I really went through life as a male, you know, and decided that it’s not for me. I just held it out … I thought I was a gay man. It turns out I wasn’t homosexual, I was transsexual,” she told <i>Coconuts</i> CEO Byron Perry in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O523eznvRgM">debut episode of Being</a>, a new Coconuts TV interview series. </p>
      <p>“After three months, when I popped the first pill, that was the most at home I’ve ever felt in my body in the 23 years I’ve lived.”</p>
