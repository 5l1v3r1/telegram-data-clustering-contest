      <h1>Julián Castro tweets alongside Democratic debate despite not qualifying</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/marina-pitofsky" target="_blank">Marina Pitofsky</a></address>
      <p>Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro tweeted his policy proposals alongside the fifth Democratic primary debate Wednesday night, even though he failed to qualify.</p>
      <p>To qualify for the debate in Atlanta, candidates had to poll at 3 percent or higher in four qualifying state or national polls, according to the Democratic National Committee, or at 5 percent or higher in two polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina. They also had to receive donations from 165,000 donors, with at least 600 donors in at least 20 states.</p>
      <p>Castro reached the necessary number of donors, but his campaign did not reach the poll threshold.</p>
      <p>That didn’t stop the former Obama administration Housing and Urban Development secretary from answering questions alongside the other candidates, though.</p>
      <p>When candidates were asked about the impeachment inquiry House Democrats launched against <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> earlier this year, Castro tweeted, “The day the Mueller report was released, I said publicly that I supported Congress opening an impeachment inquiry on Donald Trump. The testimony we've already seen has confirmed a bribery scheme the likes of which this country has never seen. #DemDebates #JulianDebates.” </p>

      <p>When the candidates were asked about housing, he tweeted, “Wonder who could have answered that one?” alongside his campaign’s “People First Housing” proposal.</p>

      <p>As the Democratic candidates delivered their closing statements at the debate, he pointed out that neither the candidates nor the moderators raised any issues about gender identity or transgender communities on Transgender Day of Remembrance.</p>
