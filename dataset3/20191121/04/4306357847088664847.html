      <h2>Jose Mourinho explains why he has chosen to take over at Tottenham Hotspur</h2>

      <h3>Jose Mourinho has insisted that it is Tottenham Hotspur’s “quality” players that attracted him to the north London club.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho was appointed as the club’s new manager on Wednesday morning after the Lilywhites opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Spurs had been struggling under the Argentine head coach, with the north London club currently languishing down in 14th place in the Premier League table having won just three of 12 top-flight games this term.</p>
      <p>Mourinho brings with him a wealth of experience and the Portuguese coach has been out of work since being sacked by Manchester United last December.</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea FC and Real Madrid boss has now explained exactly why he has chosen to take the reigns at the north London club.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Tottenham Hotspur’s <a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/jose-mourinho-appointed-new-head-coach/">website</a>, Mourinho said: “I am excited to be joining a club with such a great heritage and such passionate supporters.</p>
      <p>“The quality in both the squad and the academy excites me. Working with these players is what has attracted me.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy also gave his reasons for appointing the Portuguese coach.</p>
      <p>He said: “In Jose we have one of the most successful managers in football.</p>
      <p>“He has a wealth of experience, can inspire teams and is a great tactician. He has won honours at every club he has coached. We believe he will bring energy and belief to the dressing room.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s first game in charge of Tottenham Hotspur will be an away clash against West Ham United in the Premier League on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>The north London side will then take on Olympiakos in the Champions League on Tuesday night next week.</p>
