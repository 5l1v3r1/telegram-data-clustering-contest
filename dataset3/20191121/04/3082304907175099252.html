        <b>Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are undoubtedly the greatest footballing duo of the century, but one man claims he might have been as good as him.</b>
      </p>
      <p>That man is Wesley Sneijder, who was widely tipped to win the Ballon d’Or award back in 2010 after a phenomenal year all around, but was beaten to it in the end by Lionel Messi.</p>
      <p>And now, the Dutchman claims that if he was 100% dedicated to craft, he might have been in the same league as Messi and Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>“If I would have lived 100% for my sport, I would have joined the list of Cristiano &amp; Messi. I know that. But I didn’t want to, and I don’t regret that. It’s not like I couldn’t do it, I just didn’t want to.”</p>
      <p>Sneijder also threw some shade on Ronaldo’s free-kick taking ability.</p>
      <p>“If you look at Cristiano, he will stand behind the ball 30 times and won’t score 1,” Sneijder went on.</p>
      <p>“Then I think to myself, how?”</p>
      <p>He also said that Guti was the greatest player he ever played with.</p>
      <p>“Best player I ever played with? Then I choose Guti,” Sneijder revealed.</p>
      <p>“He impressed me the most. Me and Guti found each other blindly on the pitch, that man was phenomanal. Of-course I played with lots of big players but he impressed me the most.”</p>
