      <h1>AA lawmaker in Imo defects to PDP</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:53:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:53</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>Syracuse Okoro, representing Ohaji/Egbema Constituency in the Imo State House of Assembly on the platform of the Action Alliance, has dumped the party for the ruling Peoples Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>The Speaker of the House, Collins Chiji (PDP-Isiala Mbano), announced Okoro’s defection at the plenary session on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Okoro, who represents the oil-rich constituency, was quoted as citing “personal reasons” for his defection.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the House has adopted a motion urging the Imo Environmental Transformation Commission to enforce sanctions on motorists and pedestrians, allegedly defacing green areas in Owerri.</p>
      <p>The sponsor of the motion, Arthur Egwim (AA-Ideato North), said the green areas, which had added to the beauty of the state capital, had been ruined by some reckless motorists and pedestrians.</p>
      <p>Egwim noted that there was need for the Chairman of ETRACO to invoke the prohibitive sections of the law establishing the commission to stop the unlawful practice.</p>
      <p>He said commercial motorists and vendors now make use of green areas as parks, thereby sabotaging the efforts of the state government to improve the environment.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker also urged the commission to re-grass areas which had been defaced and also post warning signs against further acts of defacement by motorists and pedestrians.</p>
      <p>The motion was seconded by Johnson Duru (PDP-Ideato South) and adopted after a voice vote.</p>
      <p>The Speaker of the House directed the clerk to write to the ENTRACO Chairman and advise him accordingly.</p>
