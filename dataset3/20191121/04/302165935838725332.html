      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Then Auditor-General (A-G) Tan Sri Ambrin Buang appeared disturbed upon leaving a meeting with government and 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) officials who sought to alter his audit report of the firm, the High Court heard today.</p>
      <p>National Audit Department (NAD) director Nor Salwani Muhammad said this as the fifth prosecution witness in former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak’s joint trial with 1MDB ex-chief executive Arul Kanda Kandasamy for allegedly tampering with the report.</p>
      <p>During examination-in-chief by Datuk Seri Gopal Sri Ram, she recounted events from a meeting on February 24, 2016, the office of Tan Sri Ali Hamsa, who was then the chief secretary to the government. </p>
      <p>Sri Ram: Did you notice how Tan Sri Ambrin look coming out of the meeting? </p>
      <p>Salwani: He looked very upset with what had happened, he was mumbling something. So, I followed him to the toilet.</p>
      <p>Sri Ram: So, he looked upset and then you followed him... </p>
      <p>Salwani: I followed him to the washroom, he wanted to wash his face and refreshed himself.</p>
      <p>Sri Ram: Why did you have to do that? </p>
      <p>Salwani: Because I was afraid he might fall down because he looks very fragile at the time.</p>
      <p>Sri Ram: He was upset? </p>
      <p>Salwani: Yes, very upset. </p>
      <p>Sri Ram: Who wouldn’t be under those circumstances. Did he say anything? </p>
      <p>Salwani: He was mumbling like, ‘What was the purpose of the audit?’ That’s what I heard. </p>
      <p>Previously, Ali testified that Najib, after receiving the draft of the final audit report on February 22, 2016, was <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/11/19/upset-najib-ordered-1mdb-audit-report-changes-to-hide-two-different-financi/1811248">unhappy over its findings </a>and had instructed him to conduct a coordination meeting between 1MDB former chief executive Arul Kanda Kandasamy and the National Audit Department to resolve dissatisfaction about the audit report. </p>
      <p>As a result, a meeting was held on February 24, 2016 meeting, which leads to four main items were removed from the A-G’s audit report on 1MDB, including an incident where Najib failed to inform the Cabinet over the agreement with the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to delay a RM5 billion fund-raising exercise. </p>
