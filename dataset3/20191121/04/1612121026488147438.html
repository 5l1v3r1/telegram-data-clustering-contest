      <p><a href="http://www.talkandroid.com/tag/galaxy-s11">Galaxy S11</a> leaks have started to ramp up, and now Samsung’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340519-first-galaxy-s11-rumors-start-up-hinting-at-a-major-change-to-samsungs-cameras/">own camera software</a> is starting to hint at what’s to come with their 2020 flagship.</p>
      <p>The latest versions of the camera application have some references to higher-resolution video recording, as well as to a phone with a massive megapixel count. These kinds of things aren’t always accurate, but if Samsung is building software to reference new hardware, we can make some pretty good guesses.</p>
      <p>The app now has references to brand new photography features, like Director’s View, Single Take Photo, Night Hyperlapse, and a few other things, plus strings that mention whopping 8K video recording. The Galaxy S10 can handle 4K recording, so doubling that up to 8K recording would make for a killer marketing feature. Samsung’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346298-samsungs-flagship-exynos-990-chip-is-also-the-exynos-9830-for-the-galaxy-s11/">newest Exynos chip</a> also supports 8K recording, so everything lines up for next year.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the app also mentions a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345999-samsung-galaxy-s11-108mp-camera/">phone with a 108MP sensor</a>. What phone is Samsung likely to release soon with a megapixel count that high? I’ll let you guess.</p>
      <p>There’s one last fuzzy detail that references a device with a 20:9 aspect ratio. Since Samsung uses this app across multiple devices, this isn’t a guarantee that the Galaxy S11 will be <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345361-new-leak-points-to-a-taller-209-aspect-ratio-for-the-galaxy-s11/">adopting the taller aspect ratio</a>. It’s certainly a possibility, but with how many phones that they launch every year, it could very well be a specific device launched in South America at a very specific demographic, too. Hard to tell this early on.</p>
