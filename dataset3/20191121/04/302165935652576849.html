      <h1>Now, Yong insist no ‘black hand’ from Perak DAP leadership in his rape case</h1>

      <p>IPOH, Nov 21 — DAP assemblyman Paul Yong Choo Kiong today denied there was conspiracy within Perak DAP leadership linked to his rape case. </p>
      <p>Yong said that the Perak DAP committee led by Nga Kor Ming has consistently supported him.</p>
      <p>“This media statement is made to clear any false impression and perception that is being created by certain quarters.</p>
      <p>“The full solidarity expressed by the state committee led by Nga is truly and deeply appreciated. I sincerely believe there is no ‘Black Hand’ within the Perak DAP leadership with regard to my case,” he said in a statement. </p>
      <p>“I wish to take this opportunity to thank the Perak DAP state committee for their trust and confidence in me that I am innocent in the criminal charge against me.</p>
      <p>“As such I urge all parties to stand together to fight against the real culprit who has a hand in my case,” he said. </p>
      <p>On Sunday, <i><a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/11/17/audio-purportedly-of-perak-dap-leaders-internal-criticism-circulating-after/1810655">Malay Mail reported</a></i> of an audio clip suggesting simmering discontent within Perak DAP being shared on the WhatsApp messaging platform.</p>
      <p>In the 18-second audio clip, a speaker who sounded like Nga was heard condemning a fellow party man’s resumption of official duties.</p>
      <p>“Wearing DAP clothes, getting DAP’s salary, but consider himself as a great person. Now announced that he had returned to work without DAP’s permission.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to say who he is, but I’m sure everyone understands who exactly I meant,” the voice in the clip said in Mandarin.</p>
      <p>No names were mentioned in the clip but the message also included a poster featuring a silhouette and the words “Black Hand”, a Malay translation of the audio, a group photo of Nga with four other people, and an article in the vernacular Chinese language from Sin Chew Daily with the headline “Paul Yong resumes duties”. </p>
      <p>Tronoh assemblyman Yong was charged with raping his former Indonesian maid on July 7.</p>
      <p>He had taken a leave of absence, presumably pending his trial, but resumed his post chairman of the state housing, local government, public transport, non-Muslim affairs and new village committee last Friday.</p>
      <p>Yong said the decision was made after a discussion with Perak Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Ahmad Faizal Azumu.</p>
      <p>Yong’s case previously led to open dissent from sections of Perak DAP towards Nga.</p>
