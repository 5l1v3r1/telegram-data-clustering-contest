      <p>Apple integrates several ways into its mobile operating system to toggle <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/iOS-13/">iOS 13</a>’s new <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/dark-mode/">dark mode</a> feature on or off on demand, but perhaps you aren’t satisfied with them or you’d prefer to use a different method?</p>
      <p>Enter <b>Noire</b>, a new and free <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweak</a> by iOS developer <i>MTAC</i> that lets you turn dark mode on or off with a simple swipe-down gesture in the first page of the Settings app.</p>
      <p>Noire works like jailbreak tweaks akin to <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/16/dragspring/">Dragspring</a>, except that it toggles dark mode rather than respringing. To help showcase how the tweak works, here’s an animated <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/gif/">GIF</a>:</p>

      <p>It takes about a half-screen pull-down gesture to toggle the tweak, but the transition from light mode to dark mode and vice-versa is almost instantaneous, just like tapping on the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/control-center/">Control Center</a> toggle button or enabling it manually via the Settings app.</p>
      <p>Noire doesn’t come with any options to configure, and since it achieves the goal it sets out to accomplish at first glance, it really doesn’t need any. Personally, I find this gesture to be rather pleasant.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in trying Noire, then you can <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.mtac.noire">download it free of cost from the Packix repository</a> in your preferred package manager. The tweak supports all <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak/">jailbroken</a> iOS 13 devices.</p>
      <p>Will you be installing Noire, or are you content with he native dark mode toggling methods? Let us know in the comments section.</p>
