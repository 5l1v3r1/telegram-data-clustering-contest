      <p><b>CHICAGO (AP)</b> — Lauri Markkanen scored 24 points to bust out of a slump, Wendell Carter Jr. had 12 points and 15 rebounds, and the Chicago Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 109-89 on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>It was Markkanen’s first 20-point game since scoring 35 points on opening night. Tomas Satoransky and Shaquille Harrison each had 15 points as the Bulls snapped a three-game losing streak.</p>
      <p>Derrick Rose had 18 points and Blake Griffin — in just his third game of the season — added 16 as the Pistons dropped their fifth straight.</p>
      <p>The Bulls won the first meeting between the teams 112-106 on Nov. 1, also at the United Center.</p>
      <p>Detroit’s Andre Drummond finished with six points and 14 rebounds before fouling out with six minutes to go. Drummond had 25 points and 24 rebounds against the Bulls three weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Markkanen, who entered the game shooting just 36.2% from the field, had 15 first-half points on 5-for-8 shooting (including 2 for 2 on 3-pointers) as Chicago took a 59-55 halftime lead.</p>
      <p>That included an incredible six points on one possession late in the second quarter. Markkanen hit a 3-pointer while being fouled by Drummond, who was assessed a flagrant foul after review. Markkanen hit the free throw to complete the four-point play and then scored on a driving layup after the Bulls inbounded the ball.</p>
      <p>That stretch snapped a tie at 51 and gave the Bulls a 57-51 lead with 1:55 left.</p>
      <p>Chicago took an 84-71 lead after three quarters and then stretched it to 89-71 on five quick points by Thaddeus Young. The Bulls coasted from there. Markkanen hit a 3 with about 5 minutes to play for a 99-77 lead, Chicago’s biggest of the game.</p>

        <b>TIP-INS</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pistons: G Reggie Jackson (lumbar stress reaction) missed his 12th straight game. F Tony Snell (left hip strain) and G Khyri Thomas (right foot stress reaction) also sat out.</p>
      <p>Bulls: F Otto Porter (left foot) will be sidelined an additional two-plus weeks after a follow-up MRI taken on Tuesday revealed a bone bruise that wasn’t discovered in the initial MRI two weeks ago. Porter will be re-evaluated in two weeks . F Chandler Hutchison, who had been starting in Porter’s absence, sat out with inflammation in both shins … G Coby White played despite spraining an ankle in pregame warmups.</p>
      <p>
        <b>DENG HONORED</b>
      </p>
      <p>Luol Deng, who signed a one-day contract with the Bulls last month before retiring, was honored during the game. The 6-foot-9 forward played the first 10 of his 15 NBA seasons with the Bulls after being selected with the seventh pick of the 2004 draft.</p>
      <p>“It’s what makes sense,” Deng said. “Chicago means a lot to me. When you look back, coming here as a young kid, a young man, 19 … there’s a lot of history here and I wanted it to end the right way.”</p>
      <p>A video tribute was played during a timeout in the second quarter and several of Deng’s former Bulls teammates — including Joakim Noah and Ben Gordon — attended the game. Deng said he picked this game because he wanted Rose to be present as well.</p>
