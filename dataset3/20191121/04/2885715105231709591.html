      <p>Harrison Ford starrer The Call of the Wild’s trailer is out, and it promises an ‘adventure of a lifetime.’ Adapted from the beloved literary classic of the same name written by Jack London, the trailer gives us a peek into the spell-binding visual effects and cinematography.</p>
      <p>The movie revolves around the journey of a dog called Buck, who ends up befriending a man, John Thornton. During his lifetime, Buck goes through numerous ups and downs, and it is his journey that we are supposed to follow in the Chris Sanders directorial.</p>
      <p>The trailer features a heavily bearded Harrison Ford talking to an adorable-looking St. Bernard (Buck), and apart from the awe-inspiring camera work, it is their bond that also demands your attention.</p>

      <p>The official synopsis of The Call of the Wild reads, “Adapted from the beloved literary classic, The Call of the Wild vividly brings to the screen the story of Buck, a big-hearted dog whose blissful domestic life is turned upside down when he is suddenly uprooted from his California home and transplanted to the exotic wilds of the Alaskan Yukon during the Gold Rush of the 1890s. As the newest rookie on a mail delivery dog sled team–and later its leader–Buck experiences the adventure of a lifetime, ultimately finding his true place in the world and becoming his own master.”</p>
      <p>Also starring Dan Stevens, Omar Sy, Karen Gillan among others in pivotal roles, The Call of the Wild will release on February 21, 2020 in the US.</p>
