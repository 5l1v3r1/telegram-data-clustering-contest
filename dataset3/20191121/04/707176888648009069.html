      <h1>Gritty professional memoirs are the hot publishing trend</h1>
      <h2>Adam Kay and other medics and lawyers top the bestseller lists with tell-all books</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:00:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Jacobs</a></address>
      <p>In Adam Kay’s first book, <i><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/This-Going-Hurt-Secret-Diaries/dp/1509858636">This is Going to Hurt</a>, </i>he described his former job as a junior doctor with disarming honesty: “The hours are terrible, the pay is terrible, the conditions are terrible; you’re under-appreciated, unsupported, disrespected and frequently physically endangered. But there’s no better job in the world.”</p>
      <p>He then got emails from angry parents complaining that he had put their children off medicine, to which he says: “Good! It’s a job you have to do with your eyes open. Medical schools are not honest about the bad days. It’s deeply important to know what the job is. I didn’t.”</p>
      <p>His latest book, <i>Twas The Nightshift Before Christmas</i>, also focuses on the highs — delivering healthy babies — and lows — dealing with birth complications or the husbands of wives in labour — of being a junior doctor. He wrote the books, he says, to show “the impact of the job on a person — the missed Christmases and birthdays. It is honest in its portrayal of the NHS.”</p>
      <p>The brutal — and comic — honesty has proved a commercial success. According to BookScan,<i> This is Going to Hurt</i> has sold more than 1m copies. <i><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Twas-Nightshift-Before-Christmas-Adam/dp/1529018587">Twas the Night shift Before Christmas</a> </i>is currently the bestselling book on Amazon UK and is published next month in the US.</p>
      <p>Kiera O’Brien, charts and data editor at the Bookseller, a trade publication, says memoirs of jobs are a “huge trend”. Those that reveal problems in the public sector, as Dr Kay does with the NHS and the Secret Barrister does with the legal system, are particularly popular. Dr Amanda Brown’s <i><a href="https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/9780008311445/the-prison-doctor/">The Prison Doctor</a> </i>has sold about 61,000 copies in paperback, forensic pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd’s <i><a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/288/288926/unnatural-causes/9781405923538.html">Unnatural Causes</a></i>has sold 108,000, while nurse Christie Watson’s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557756/the-language-of-kindness-by-christie-watson/"><i>The Language of Kindness</i></a> is on 158,000.</p>
      <p>Ms O’Brien says that for “narrative non-fiction at the moment, there’s been a huge move towards books that help readers understand the rapidly changing world we’re living in”. In part, she says, it is “a backlash against celebrity memoirs, especially in the social media age when celebrities’ lives are constantly played out online anyway.” Dr Kay thinks that “readers are very interested in extraordinary real lives, fire fighters and [the police]. People are slightly less interested in a pop star with coke. [These are] more relatable but no less extraordinary.”</p>
      <p>Part of the appeal of these professional confessionals is that they give readers insight into different professions. Alexandra Budjanovcanin, a lecturer at King’s College Business School, London, who has researched occupational regret, says that such books give those who are contemplating careers a clear view of what it entails. “They let us test assumptions we have about career paths.” People typically plan future careers with little information about the everyday experience of a job. These memoirs provide a useful insight into the hardships and day-to-day reality that lie behind job titles.</p>
      <p>Christie Watson says that she wanted to write a memoir to show that nursing is more than “kindness, caring and compassion. The act of holding someone’s hand is more complicated than it appears — they will be making complex assessments of risk.” She chose to write after having left nursing to avoid having her writing mediated by press officers trying to manage the message.</p>

      <p>A better understanding of what lies ahead is especially important for young people, says Dr Kay. The British education system, he says, makes young people specialise too early. “Sixteen is a very bad age to choose the future of your life. One thing, the US does get right is [offering] medicine as a postgraduate degree. At 21, you’re still an idiot obviously but have informed consent at that age [and] have a better chance of surveying the landscape.”</p>
      <p>In his own case, he chose the job as a path “of least resistance”. His family were medics, his school was a “sausage factory for doctors and lawyers. It is the most wonderful, rewarding job but we need to be slightly measured. I don’t think everyone is cut out for this.”</p>
      <p>Even with medics in the family, he was not prepared for the reality of the job. Doctors, he says, “aren’t very honest about the job. You’re trained to be very militaristic. It’s so ingrained, the stiff upper lip”. When someone asked how his day was, the answer would always be “fine”. Honest memoirs can make people in the professions feel less alone. Dr Kay has received messages from doctors saying that they thought they were the only ones suffering. “We all pretend [to be OK] — that’s not healthy.”</p>
      <p>Neil Samworth described the stress of being a prison officer, including assaults and finding prisoners who have died by suicide, and eventually suffering from PTSD in his book <i>Strangeways: My Life As a Prison Officer. “</i>Lots of people who are police, prison officers are struggling.”</p>
      <p>He says he knows of at least “two dozen” people who were going to go into the prison service but changed their minds after reading the book. “People [who] actually believe they’re going to change people’s lives. It very quickly gets knocked out of you. Prison doesn’t rehabilitate anyone.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/books/the-secret-barrister/secret-barrister/GOR009785045?keyword=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA5dPuBRCrARIsAJL7oeiIGzFNu6T7GrgCXwBmppRkj-J_xFyMd7IfnyOBSf12_Kbmzu3-W5QaAtxCEALw_wcB"><i>The Secret Barrister</i></a>, the anonymously authored book about the workings of the English legal system, has sold 290,000 print copies. Its lawyer author, who has 269,000 followers on Twitter, says by email that much of the feedback has been from people who considered studying for the criminal Bar and then opted for a different path. “Generally the expressions are of relief, sometimes tinged with regret at missing out on the good parts, but usually overwhelmingly grateful that they didn’t end up toiling in a broken system,” they write.</p>
      <p>Law students, on the other hand, “seem irrepressibly drawn to the existence I describe; very few have said they’ve been deterred, and many have got in touch to say that they have been convinced that criminal law is the destination for them.”</p>

      <p>Sarah Langford, who wrote <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1114624/in-your-defence/9781784163082.html"><i>In Your Defence</i></a> about her experience as a criminal and family barrister, finds the term “memoir” pretentious. She wanted to tackle the emotional side of “seeing and hearing the worst of humanity whilst also trying to cling on to both my sanity and my compassion”.</p>
      <p>What separates this genre of writing from, say, biography or traditional memoir, she says, “is the willingness of the writers to expose their own humanity — their fears, their weaknesses, their vulnerabilities — doing a job which brings them into contact with the extremes of life. They are more than an insight into a job — they explore how it feels to do the job.” She believes that a generation ago, professionals disapproved of showing their vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>While Ms Watson has referred some nurses who have been in touch to the Samaritans, she has been gratified that the book has been a spur to others who are encouraged to keep going. “It’s been a positive affirmation of the job,” she says.</p>
      <p>Leah Hazard, author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1117131/hard-pushed/9781786331601.html"><i>Hard Pushed</i></a>, a midwifery memoir, says that being the author of such a book comes with a “strange responsibility”, as many women have contacted her to say they want to switch to midwifery. “It’s just one midwife’s story — mine — and I do explain quite clearly in the book that I don’t pretend or wish to be representative of all midwives everywhere. I do sometimes wonder whether readers gloss over the low points of the book.”</p>
      <p>Ms Langford believes that the vocational nature of these public-sector memoirists is key to their popularity. “I wanted to explain to those who pay for it — taxpayers — why the justice system is worth defending, and the consequences of failing to do so.”</p>
      <p>Many of these job memoirs tap into a desire to escape the desk-bound working life of most readers. “I don’t think that an accountant memoir will come out soon,” says Ms Watson. “Maybe there is a role for a funny satirical office [worker]?”</p>
      <p>Adam Kay is now a full-time writer and <a href="http://www.adamkay.co.uk/">stand-up comedian</a>. He says he misses medicine but regrets having chosen to work in obstetrics and gynaecology. “The highs drew me in and the lows were too much.” Perhaps he might still be a doctor, he says, if he had “chosen [a specialism that allowed] an occasional cup of coffee. When it wasn’t a matter of life and death every minute.”</p>
