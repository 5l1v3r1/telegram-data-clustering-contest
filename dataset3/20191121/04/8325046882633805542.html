      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-cory-booker-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-3">Sen. Cory Booker</a> went after former Vice President Joe Biden during the fifth Democratic debate on Wednesday night over Biden’s opposition to legalizing marijuana.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot respect for the vice president – he swore me into my office, he’s a hero,” Booker began. “This week I hear him literally say that I don’t think we should legalize marijuana – I thought you might have been high when you said it.”</p>
      <p>That line provoked big laughter and applause from the audience.</p>
      <p>“Marijuana in our country is already legal for privileged people,” Booker went on, to heavy applause. “The war on drugs has been a war on black and brown people.”</p>
      <p>Biden responded by reiterating his support for decriminalizing marijuana and arguing that he has strong support from black voters.</p>
      <p>“I come out of the black community in terms of my support,” Biden said. “They know me, they know who I am.”</p>

      <p>A former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, Booker has focused heavily on criminal-justice reform throughout his political career.</p>
      <p>Booker in 2017 introduced <a href="https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/videos/10157111094132228/?hc_ref=ARRBvfjQKPphXkkHwuAIwoVG8DubxLopsjjG18ibJGH_Mm7Zo-Wxsld_d5tWWjbdbxM">legislation to legalize marijuana at the federal level</a>, highlighting the disproportionate impact that the enforcement of its prohibition has on communities of color.</p>
      <p>Recreational marijuana is now <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/legal-marijuana-states-2018-1">legal in 10 states</a>, and medical marijuana is legal in 33. A strong majority of Americans (62%) also favor legalizing marijuana, according to <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/10/08/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/">an October 2018 survey</a> from Pew Research Center, so this is an easy issue for Booker to campaign on.</p>
      <p>Views on marijuana among the US public have shifted drastically over the past 15 to 20 years. In 2000, for example, just 31% of Americans said they believed marijuana should be legalized.</p>
