      <p>Meet the Samsung W20 5G, an incrementally improved Galaxy Fold set to release in China. It’s pretty strange for Samsung to launch a better model of their daring folding phone so soon, but it’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/346524-galaxy-fold-2-model-number/">not quite the Galaxy Fold 2</a> that you might be expecting.</p>
      <h3>Small changes, better 5G</h3>
      <p>The W20 5G isn’t a fully new device, and it’s pretty much keeping the same <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343786-samsung-galaxy-fold-september-release/">design as the Galaxy Fold</a>. It does, however, have a stronger, more reinforced frame, which should alleviate some of the things that caused the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/341635-samsung-galaxy-fold-production-hits-another-snag/">Galaxy Fold to be recalled</a> in the first place.</p>
      <p>It’s also a 5G phone that’s capable of utilizing China’s non-standard 5G networks, which keeps Samsung in a <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/345327-china-is-getting-the-foldable-huawei-mate-x-smartphone-this-month/">competitive position with Huawei</a> going forward.</p>
      <p>There are some internal bumps, too, but nothing major. The phone sports a Snapdragon 855+ CPU, plus 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. The battery is actually barely smaller than in the regular Galaxy Fold, but ideally the better CPU should offset that.</p>
