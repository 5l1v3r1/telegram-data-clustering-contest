      <h1>Andrea Bocelli, Barbra Streisand, John Legend, Michael Buble And Elvis Costello Compete For Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album Grammy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:03:38+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:03</time> by <a rel="author">Charisse Van Horn</a></address>
      <p>The 62nd Grammy award nominations have been released and the nominees for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album have been announced. The nominees have been going viral on social media as topping the list is the opera singer and tenor Andrea Bocelli. Andrea has been nominated for five Grammys but hasn’t won yet. He has been nominated for his album <i>Si</i> and his fans are sounding off online letting him know that they want him to win.</p>
      <p>Barbra Streisand has 46 Grammy nominations and 8 wins and is nominated for her album <i>Walls</i>. It is her only nomination this year and she has plenty of support from those who want to see her earn her ninth Grammy.</p>
      <p>Elvis Costello as a solo artist has 1 win and 15 nominations. He is nominated with his band Elvis Costello and the Imposters for their album <i>Look Now</i>.</p>
      <p>John Legend has been nominated for his album <i>A Legendary Christmas. </i>John Legend has 31 nominations and 10 wins.</p>
      <p>Michael Buble is also nominated for his album <i>Love (Deluxe Edition).</i> Michael Buble has 11 nominations and 4 wins.</p>

      <p>The Best Traditional Pop Vocal category is one that some people are a little confused about. The Best Traditional Pop Vocal category is for albums where at least 51 percent of the album is pure vocal tracks in traditional music styles.</p>
      <p>Since Andrea Bocelli has yet to win a Grammy, he is the leading favorite and many people are supporting the Italian opera singer on various social media platforms.</p>
      <p>The category used to be limited to songs from the Great American Songbook but was recently expanded and allowed approximately 80 more entries into the category. There was a lot of hope that Joni Mitchell would score a Grammy nomination but it wasn’t to be.</p>
      <p>What do you think of the five nominees for the Best Traditional Pop Vocal Grammy award? Do you think the best nominees were selected? The Grammy Awards will take place on January 26, 2020, on CBS.</p>
      <p>Are you happy that the Grammys expanded the Best Pop Vocal Album category to include more entries?</p>
