      <h1>Susan Boyle's life story to be turned into movie with Meryl Streep</h1>
      <h2>A new film company has picked up the rights to her 2010 autobiography The Woman I Was Born To Be and will approach the likes of Netflix and Amazon</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Rick Fulton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rick-fulton/</a></address>
      <p>IT’S taken seven years but after the success of the Queen and Elton John biopics – the film about <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/susan-boyle">Susan Boyle</a> is back on track.</p>
      <p>Since 2012, a story based on her life has been mooted, with Meryl Streep an early contender to play the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/susan-boyle">Scottish singing sensation</a>.</p>
      <p>There was also a musical about her life, I Dreamed a Dream, which starred Elaine C Smith.</p>
      <p>Now a new film company has picked up the rights to her 2010 autobiography The Woman I Was Born To Be and will approach the likes of Netflix and Amazon, with Susan getting the final say on the script.</p>

      <p>She said: “It’ll be an adaptation of the book and it’s being made into a TV film or Netflix film. It’s to come out very soon. It’s going to be very good.</p>
      <p>“I can’t say who will play me but it’s something that’s going to be a bit of a surprise. I had some say. It was a collaboration. A team effort.”</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old, from Blackburn, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/west-lothian">West Lothian</a>, took three years away from the spotlight in 2016 to deal with health issues. But this year she is back – to celebrate the 10th anniversary of that famous Britain’s Got Talent audition.</p>
      <p>She has appeared as a contestant in America’s Got Talent: The Champions, performed on America’s Got Talent and released her eighth studio album, TEN. Next year she goes on her first UK tour in six years.</p>
      <p>It’s the perfect time to make a biopic of her life – especially after the success of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody and Elton John’s Rocketman.</p>

      <p>As for why it’s taken so long, she reckoned: “It takes a while to negotiate a film.” Susan is one of Scotland’s biggest stars.</p>
      <p>Since she sang I Dreamed A Dream from Les Miserables on BGT, she has sold more than 25million records. Her first three albums went to No1 in the UK and her first two hit the top spot in the US.</p>
      <p>She has performed for the Queen and next month will sing in front of her <br/>second Pope.</p>
      <p>She’s duetted with Elvis and Donny  Osmond and yet still lives in the house she grew up in – a four-bedroom ex-council house in Blackburn.</p>
      <p>As she prepared to return to the limelight, Susan decided to watch that audition tape from January 21, 2009, which made her one of the world’s first internet superstars.</p>

      <p>Back then she wore a beige dress, black tights and white shoes. Her hair was unkempt and she had bushy eyebrows.</p>
      <p>When Simon Cowell asked how old she was, she said: “I’m 47” then began gyrating her hips “and that’s just one side of me”.</p>
      <p>You could see the audience and judges had already dismissed her. And then she sang.</p>
      <p>Susan had the last laugh. But looking at the audition – viewed 300million times and counting – she is as critical as the audience were back them.</p>
      <p>“I watched it again and thought, ‘What the hell where you playing at,’” she admitted.</p>
      <p>“I was so amateurish. I’m a bit more professional now. More grown-up and more confident now.”</p>
      <p>By her own admission, the decade has been a rollercoaster. Instant fame was very difficult. She had meltdowns. In 2012, she was diagnosed with autism – a developmental disability that affects how a person communicates and makes sense of the world.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She has become a role model for autistic people which, perhaps, is one of the things that drives her to such big success.</p>
      <p>Unemployed, single and living alone in 2009, she is now a multi-millionaire who is beaten only by Calvin Harris as the most successful Scot in the music business.</p>
      <p>Susan said: “People with autism have to prove themselves. They have problems with communication. I’d like to think I’m an example to them. If I can do it so can they. There are no barriers.” The huge demands put on her after BGT led to a public meltdown at Heathrow airport in 2016 just before the release of her seventh album A Wonderful World. She took a step back.</p>
      <p>The break has done her good and she’s raring to go. She kicks off the TEN Tour at Dundee’s Caird Hall on March 3 next year, going to Glasgow’s Armadillo the next night before dates in the rest of the UK. She returns to Scotland for her final show at Edinburgh’s Usher Hall on March 25.</p>
      <p>This year has seen the success of another West Lothian native, Lewis Capaldi – and the younger sensation will be in the UK in March next year. He’ll have a day off on Susan’s Glasgow date – 24 hours before his own gig at the Hydro in the city.</p>
      <p>She said: “My favourite? Of course he could come along and join me on stage. No problem.”</p>
      <p>A duet on her next album would also be a possibility. She added: “He’s a lovely guy. It’s something to think about for later on.”</p>
      <p>Susan is clearly enthused about next year’s tour and being back with TEN which reached No5 in the UK in May and No2 in the Scottish charts.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s lovely to be back. It doesn’t seem like 10 years. It’s flown by so quickly. I took a bit of time because I wasn’t well but it didn’t take me long to get back into the swing of things again.</p>
      <p>“I’m ready for anything. Just show me the way and I’ll do it.”</p>
