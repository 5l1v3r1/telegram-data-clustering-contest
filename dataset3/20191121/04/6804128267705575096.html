      <p>Premier League football is just around the corner, and it's going to be a hectic festive period.</p>
      <p>Games come thick and fast at this stage of the season, although with the form that the Gunners are in, that might not be such a good thing right now.</p>
      <p>Next up for Arsenal is a home game against struggling Southampton - a match they will be expecting to get three points from.</p>
      <p>Here we round-up the biggest and best news stories from around the Emirates in the past 24 hours in one place.</p>

      <p>The 19-year-old forward has been in sensational form for the Austrian side this season, scoring 15 goals and contributing four assists in the league - as well as adding seven Champions League goals to his tally from just four matches.</p>
      <p>And the fans are loving the links.</p>
      <h3>Jose Mourinho reaction</h3>

      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager has agreed a deal to become the new head coach at <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> , replacing Mauricio Pochettino, who was sacked by the club on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>And Arsenal fans cannot quite believe that Spurs have decided to go for the man who was sacked by Manchester United less than a year ago.</p>
      <h3>'Pochettino in!'</h3>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is gone.</p>
      <p>Spurs chief Daniel Levy decided enough was enough despite the coach leading them to the Champions League final last season.</p>
