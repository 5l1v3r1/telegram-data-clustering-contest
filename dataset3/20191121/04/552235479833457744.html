      <h1>Police under fire after Glasgow University students kept in dark about string of sex attacks</h1>
      <h2>Warnings surrounding the four incidents were only issued for the the first time on Tuesday with the lack of information branded a "disgrace".</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Sally Hind, Nicholas Keyden, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sally-hind/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/nicholas-keyden/</a></address>
      <p>Police have been accused of putting safety at risk after investigating a rape and a spate of sex attacks near Glasgow University and only telling students weeks later.</p>
      <p>Warnings surrounding the four incidents were only issued for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-university-step-up-security-20916745">first time on Tuesday</a> – sparking a furious backlash.</p>
      <p>The university’s student president said he was “incredibly angry” at the lack of information, while rector <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/lawyer-slams-police-after-lazio-20724041">Aamer Anwar</a> branded the timing of the alert “a disgrace”.</p>
      <p>Other students told how they had been left too afraid to walk alone near the campus in light of the attacks.</p>
      <p>Over the past month, a 20-year-old woman was subjected to a sexual assault close to the university library and three other victims have been attacked in the west end.</p>
      <p>Police Scotland confirmed no public appeals were made at the time of the four assaults and, while they are still hunting the rapist who committed the most recent attack, a man has been charged in connection with the earlier assaults.</p>

      <p>Glasgow University said it was only informed of the incidents by police on Tuesday and immediately issued guidance to students and raised security in the area.</p>
      <p>Two sexual assaults took place in Lawrence Street, Partick, and Napiershall Street, North Woodside, on October 17, followed by a third on Cranworth Street, Hillhead, on October 24.</p>
      <p>A 34-year-old man has been charged in connection with the three incidents.</p>
      <p>A week later, the 20-year-old victim was raped in Sutherland Lane, near the library, in the early hours of October 31.</p>
      <p>The warning issued to students by the university by internal email and social media read: “There have been four alleged cases of sexual assault in the West End of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police-scotland">Police Scotland</a> have charged a man in connection with three of these assaults.</p>
      <p>“Incidents like this are rare and student safety is of the utmost importance to the university. ”</p>
      <p>Glasgow University Students’ Representative Council (SRC) president Scott Kirby said the warning came too late. He said: “It is unfathomable how this has not been communicated as students rightfully feel like they have been let down for not being made aware of these incidents.</p>
      <p>“We are incredibly angry and as a priority we will be seeking assurances from the university and Police Scotland that this does not happen again as student safety is of utmost importance to us.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a tweet to the university, police and campus security, student Rebecca Smith said: “There should have been a message about this weeks ago, especially since one of the attacks was basically on campus.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had my partner walking me home since the first attack and I’m disgusted women (and men) weren’t warned sooner.”</p>
      <p>Anwar added: “The safety of our students should be paramount but if they don’t have the information, how can they take precautions?</p>
      <p>“If sex attacks are taking place then our students have a right to know immediately.”</p>
      <p>Responding to the backlash, the university tweeted: “We understand concerns re: the timing of our posts.</p>
      <p>“As soon as Police Scotland made us aware of the assaults, we put advice out.”</p>
      <p>Police Scotland said: “A 34-year-old man was arrested, charged and was subject of a report to the Procurator Fiscal following a report of three sexual assaults in the West End of Glasgow on October 17 and October 24. He is due to appear at court at a later date.”</p>
      <p>A Glasgow University spokeswoman said: “We have appealed to staff and students to share any concerns or information by contacting the university security team or Police Scotland.”</p>
