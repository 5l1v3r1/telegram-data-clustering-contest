      <p>Gallagher's elite rank - which was recently restored by US President Donald Trump following the soldier's court-martial - could be removed as the US military has already notified him.</p>
      <p>Trump also pardoned Army First Lieutenant Clint Lorance and Army Major Mathew Golsteyn, who <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911061077236561-guilty-for-exposing-us-war-crimes-vivienne-westwood-slams-uk-show-trial-at-julian-assange-rally/">were accused</a> separately of war crimes, along with reinstating Gallagher's rank.</p>
      <blockquote>Gallagher had been demoted following a July conviction for posing in a photo with the body of a dead terrorist during a 2017 deployment in Iraq, but was <a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201910311077186489-cia-backed-afghan-death-squads-civilians/">cleared of murder charges</a> stemming from the enemy fighter’s fatal stabbing.</blockquote>
      <p>According to media reports, if Gallagher loses his rank as a SEAL, he would either have to retire or find a different position in the Navy. Reuters reported Wednesday, citing Gallagher's defence team, that the move to take away Gallagher's Trident pin designating him a SEAL was being driven by Naval Special Warfare commander Rear Admiral Collin Green.</p>
      <p>Gallagher would have reportedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201911171077329028-british-government-army-alleged-war-crimes/">faced a possible life sentence</a> had he been convicted on the charges he faced.</p>
