      <p>Central Square's marketing manager Kate O'Hehir said: "Everyone's been really supportive to help make it happen. We can't wait."</p>
      <p>"Customers will be able to get some $2 cheap eats, come out here, listen to the music, and enjoy the vibe."</p>
      <p>She said it was a great opportunity to welcome some new people into the centre, with thousands of visitors expected to be in Ballarat for Spilt Milk.</p>
      <p>Meraki Minds also play the next day at the festival, which takes place for the first time in the city.</p>
