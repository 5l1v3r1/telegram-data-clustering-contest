      <h1>Buttigieg attacks Gabbard for meeting ‘murderous dictator’ Bashar Assad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:43:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:43</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Pete Buttigieg went after Tulsi Gabbard for her foreign policy of keeping the door open to meeting with dictators.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old mayor ripped Gabbard specifically for meeting with Syrian strongman Bashar Assad, who the <a href="https://apnews.com/0bbfce47f71c4955bc532f39c69ff3a8">U.S. has blamed</a> for chemical weapons attacks that have killed dozens.</p>
      <p>“I’m talking about building up alliances. And if your question is about experience, let’s also talk about judgment. One of the foreign leaders you mentioned meeting was Bashar al Assad,” Buttigieg said.</p>
      <p>“I have in my experience, such as it is — whether you think it counts or not since it wasn’t accumulated in Washington — enough judgment that I would not have sat down with a murderous dictator like that,” he continued to cheering from the crowd.</p>

      <p>Gabbard, who is known for her anti-war foreign policy, was attacked by Kamala Harris earlier in the night, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/lies-smears-and-innuendos-gabbard-responds-to-harris-attacks">prompting her to go on the offensive</a>.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg is registering at 8% support, according to the RealClearPolitics national <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/2020_democratic_presidential_nomination-6730.html">average</a> of polls, while Gabbard, 38, is languishing at 2% support.</p>
