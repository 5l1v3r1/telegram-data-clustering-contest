      <h1>Gigi Hadid And Zayn Malik Reportedly ‘Reconnecting’ In The Aftermath Of Her Whirlwind Tyler Cameron Romance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:14:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:14</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Is Gigi Hadid going back to her ex, Zayn Malik after her hot romance with Tyler Cameron came to an end?  According to a new report, the supermodel is now back ‘in touch’ with the ex-One Direction member.</p>
      <p>After all, the singer ‘has always had a soft spot’ in the model’s heart so another reunion between the two is not impossible.</p>
      <p>As fans know, the two have been through a couple of reunions so aren’t they already aware they don’t work together?</p>
      <p>Apparently, it’s not that simple and one source tells E! News that Gigi is ‘reconnecting’ with Zayn at this time.</p>
      <p>The insider told the news outlet the Hadid sister ‘has always had a soft spot for Zayn [Malik] and they have a lot of history together.’</p>
      <p>Indeed, the two were romantically linked for the first time back in 2015, around this time.</p>
      <p>In early 2016, their relationship was confirmed when the model appeared in Zayn’s very intimate music video for PILLOWTALK.</p>
      <p>While it seemed to be going great between them for the following couple of years, in March of last year, they announced their split on social media.</p>
      <p>Not too long after however, they sparked rumors that they were back together.</p>
      <p>Regardless, it did not last long and at the beginning of this year, they were once again separated.</p>
      <p>But now, the source explains that ‘They went through a phase when they took time apart and were not communicating at all, but they’ve been in touch recently. She’s supportive of him. They chat here and there but it has been casual.’</p>
      <p>This comes after Gigi’s public romance with Bachelorette star Tyler Cameron, who even reportedly refused to be the next Bachelor because he was already dating Gigi at the time.</p>
