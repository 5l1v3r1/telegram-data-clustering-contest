      <h2>Orlagh Walker from Killiney in South Dublin was heavily pregnant when Fergus died of a heart attack as he walked into the office - but Soaring Spirits International helped her find new love with Gary</h2>

      <p>Orlagh Walker hoped to spend the rest of her life with husband and father of her 11 children, Fergus.</p>
      <p>But tragedy struck while she was heavily pregnant with their twelfth child as she waved him off to work on March 25, 2011.</p>
      <p>Just half an hour later he had died, suffering a massive heart attack as he walked into work.</p>
      <p>"Fergus had been working really hard and was very stressed," she He had been up on a call most of the night and had an hour's sleep before he headed into work.</p>
      <p>"I said goodbye to him at 8.15 and got a call less than 30 minutes later while I was driving my kids to school to say he had walked into his office and dropped dead from a massive heart-attack.</p>
      <p>"We had been married 20 years.  We had eleven children and one on the way and suddenly, he was gone from our lives.</p>
      <p>"My oldest child was 19 and the youngest were four, three and one.  The oldest children were fantastic in support of the younger ones and it really brought our family together in very difficult times."</p>

      <p>But now she has now found love again through an American-based support service.</p>
      <p>Orlagh and her new husband Gary are about to open the first European branch of Soaring Spirits International  in Dublin next month to help others who feel isolated after losing the partner that they hoped to spend the rest of their lives with.</p>
      <p>The then 41-year old from Killiney in South Dublin couldn't find any support groups in Ireland that addressed those who were widowed early in life.</p>
      <p>"Everyone was fantastic and couldn't do enough for my children and I when Fergus died but as the weeks progressed, everyone began getting on with their own lives again.</p>
      <p>"I could't find any support in Ireland for anyone my age who was widowed so when a friend Dara offered to take all my children while I got a break, I headed for the US, registered with Soaring Spirits and began the first day of an incredible journey and transformation. </p>
      <p>"I really wouldn't be where I am now without the group, which is a peer led widowed community who reach out to over 3000000 widowed people a year.</p>

      <p>"When you lose a partner early in life, that you had wanted to spend the rest of your life with, it's hard.  You feel so isolated.  I wasn't single and I was no longer married so what was I?</p>
      <p>"This community seemed to understand that and I remember them saying as I walked in the door “You're not alone” .Even just those words meant everything at a time when I felt I was so alone.</p>
      <p>Through Soaring Spirits International, she also found her new love, Gary Walker and remarried last May</p>
      <p>Gary lost his wife in a horse riding accident on their 31st wedding anniversary and she died in his arms, when he was 50. . Lisa was his childhood sweetheart and they married at 19 after graduation from school.</p>
      <p>He has now relocated to Ireland and the couple plan to open the first European branch of Soaring Spirits International in Dublin in January. </p>
      <p>Orlagh has studied to be a counsellor in loss and bereavement and with her husband gives workshops each year back at Soaring Spirits  ‘camp widow’ in the US.</p>
      <p>"Soaring Spirits International has reached over three million people and it runs three weekend camps each year in the States and Canada.</p>
      <p>"We will be hosting the first pop up in Europe in Dublin in May of 2021 and are beginning a bi-monthly support group in Dublin in January, where widows and widowers can come together and find a community that understands and find support and friendship with others “who get it."</p>
