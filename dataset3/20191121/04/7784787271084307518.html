      <h1>The Suns have seen so many players leave. This bold stance on Jack Martin has the potential to change the trend</h1>

      <h3>Current and future Gold Coast players now mightn’t have the same confidence to request trades after the club’s strong off-season stance on Jack Martin, even if he does get to Carlton, according to dual premiership Kangaroo David King.</h3>
      <p>Days after the Suns’ 2019 campaign ended, Martin requested a trade away from the club after six seasons. He then officially nominated Carlton as his preferred choice but his trade wish wasn’t granted, with the Suns and Blues failing to strike a deal by trade deadline day, despite the lengthy notice given by the player.</p>
      <p>Martin, however, is still expected to land at the Blues via next week’s pre-season draft, with the forward set to sign a five-year deal reportedly worth at least $3.1 million.</p>

      <p>The Suns have hinted at potentially re-drafting Martin, but it’s understood the club that selects Martin in the pre-season draft would have to adhere to his nominated contract terms. That means it’s unlikely the Suns will pick Martin again due to his deal demands.</p>
      <p>Speaking on SEN, King asked whether Gold Coast could re-draft Martin to send another stern message to current and future Suns that “you're not just going to be able to walk out of this place, you're not just going to get to the destination of your choice”.</p>

      <p>But no matter the Martin outcome, King said a strong statement had already been made, praising the Suns for their tougher approach after so many young stars – like Tom Lynch, Dion Prestia, Jaeger O’Meara and Steven May – moved to rival clubs.</p>
      <p>“If you're Jack Lukosius, or you're (Matthew) Rowell or (Noah) Anderson – who we all think will end up as Pick 1 and 2 in this next draft – even the King twin (Ben King) up there, it's not going to be easy anymore to just say to the Suns, ‘yep, I want to go and play with my brother at St Kilda’,” King told<i> SEN Drive</i>.</p>
      <p>“It's going to have to be a deal that is well in favour of the Gold Coast because they’ve taken this stance. I like it – (and) I don’t know whether they have to redraft Jack to absolutely (ram home the message).</p>
      <p>“(For instance), pick Rowell in two years. (He) wants to come back and wants to play at Geelong – it doesn't matter what the club is – I'm just saying that they're basically saying to the talent on their list now that those days are gone where you just tell us you want to leave and you just tell us what you want to go and we'll get it done.</p>

      <p>“I just think it's a great stance by the Gold Coast Suns.”</p>
      <p>King said if the Suns re-drafted Martin, it’d be an “awkward situation” for the player.</p>
      <p>“If they did, where does that leave Martin? What does he do? Does he go back and play? Does he sit a year out? It's an awkward situation,” King said.</p>
      <p>“I love what they've done and I think the group up there now will say 'OK, this is tougher to just walk out than what it was two seasons ago.”</p>
