      <p>Former '<b>Produce X 101</b>' contestant <b>Kim Min Kyu </b>has grown immensely in the past year since the end of the survival show, and he proved it in his latest solo pictorial for '<b>Single</b>'s magazine. </p>
      <p>The idol flawlessly pulled off chic, modern fall/winter styles on the streets of Seoul, regarding the camera lens with the gaze of a practiced professional. In his interview, Kim Min Kyu reflected on his 'Produce X 101' days, remarking, <i>"The image of me that I've shown viewers up until now on broadcasts is very close to the shape of a singular square. From now on, I hope I can prove that there are more sides of me than the 'model student' Kim Min Kyu. I have a bit of a surprisingly dense charm and I can be funny too (Laugher)." </i></p>
      <p>He also added, <i>"I hope that when people see me, they can feel happiness and enjoyment. I tend to have a lot of inner thoughts, but I want to become an artist who can make others' worries and struggles disappear even if its just for a little bit, through me." </i></p>
