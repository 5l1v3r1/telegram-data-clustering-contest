      <h1>Bali immigration admits negligence after Lebanese fugitive escaped their watch</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:56:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>The immigration office in Bali admitted to their negligence yesterday, after a Lebanese fugitive wanted for alleged skimming of IDR7 trillion (US$496,207) in the United States managed to escape their watch and is yet to be found.</p>
      <p>According to Amran Aris, head of the Class 1 Immigration Office at Ngurah Rai International Airport, the Lebanese fugitive identified as Rabie Ayad Abderahman escaped on Oct. 28. </p>
      <p>The official said Amran had been staying at a villa in Seminyak while immigration officers kept watch on him, and appeared to be heading for a swim at the pool villa, as he was wearing swimwear.</p>
      <p>“So maybe the officers guarding him didn’t consider, why would a person run away wearing swim shorts, but then he went outside, and it’s negligence on our officer’s part who was too sure of himself, ” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kumparannews/imigrasi-bali-akui-lalai-atas-kaburnya-buronan-interpol-as-1sHyy8ikOcZ">Amran explained, as quoted by <i>Kumparan</i>.</a></p>
      <p>As Abderahman was swimming, Amrain said that the two officers guarding him went to the nearby minimarket, thinking the fugitive wouldn’t bolt. Based on reports from local media outlets, it appears that Abderahman made a run for it during this time.</p>
      <p>At a press conference yesterday, Amran said authorities are still searching for Abderahman, who is also known as Patistota, and they believe he is in the Kuta-Kerobokan area.</p>
      <p>“We did not think he will escape, because his passport is still with us. Moreover we were about to extradite him in two days, but he decided to make trouble,” Amran added. </p>

He underwent an extradition trial in Bali, and was declared free by the Denpasar District Court on Oct. 22. </p>
      <p>Prosecutors in the case then appealed the verdict to a higher court, which granted their demand to extradite Abderahman on Oct. 29. </p>
      <p>During the appeal process, however, Abderahman was allowed to stay at the Seminyak villa that had been rented by his family members, on the condition that two officers kept surveillance of him.</p>
