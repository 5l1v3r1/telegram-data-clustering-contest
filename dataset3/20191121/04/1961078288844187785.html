      <h1>Buttigieg Was a Target. But No One Was Attacked Like Warren.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:19:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:19</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Suderman</a></address>
      <p>Although the Democratic primary debate began with a series of questions about impeaching President Trump, allowing the candidates to take shots at the Republican rival they all hope to face in the general election, it swiftly transformed into a referendum on another politician who has increasingly presented a challenge to the Democratic Party: Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the year, the Massachusetts senator has vaulted into the top tier of Democratic candidates, and for the last several months she has vied for front-runner status. Yet in recent weeks, her momentum has seemed to slow as Democratic voters become anxious that her campaign for “big, structural change” is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/democratic-polls-2020-pete-buttigieg-rises-iowa-new-hampshire-biden-atop-delegate-hunt-latest-battleground-tracker/">too liberal, too radical and too risky</a> to trust in a high-stakes election against Mr. Trump.</p>
      <p>That anxiety was immediately apparent in a squabble between Ms. Warren and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey over the merits of what is arguably her signature policy: a tax on wealth. Mr. Booker took aim at the plausibility of her plan, arguing, <a href="https://taxfoundation.org/warren-wealth-tax/">correctly</a>, that wealth taxes have proven difficult to administer in other countries, and noting, again correctly, that many of the countries that have adopted wealth taxes in recent decades abandoned them as a result.</p>
      <p>Mr. Booker’s real target, however, was not the technical feasibility of Ms. Warren’s proposal, but the broader economic vision it represents. Democrats, he said, need to talk about more than how to tax wealth. They also have to talk about how to build and “grow wealth,” as he put it, as well. “Dear god,” he exclaimed, sounding more than a little bit exasperated, “we’re going to have pathways to prosperity.” Mr. Booker was not just criticizing a specific Warren proposal. He was criticizing<i> Warren-ism</i> — the underlying worldview that has driven her campaign.</p>
      <p>That criticism, both technical and philosophical, continued in an inevitable segment about Medicare for All with Ms. Warren facing criticism from both her left and right flanks. In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the tens of trillions in new government spending the health care system she favors would entail. But she recently released both a financing plan and an implementation timeline in which she proposed putting off the push for a full-fledged single-payer system.</p>
      <p>That segment opened with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., touting his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, as a way to avoid the “divisive” step of eliminating most private insurance and forcing most Americans onto a government health care plan. Mr. Biden, similarly, framed his opposition to Ms. Warren’s proposal by saying, “I trust the American people.” Once again, it was an attack not only on Ms. Warren’s plan, but on the political philosophy it represents.</p>
      <p>From the other side of the debate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose Medicare for All bill Ms. Warren backs, implied that he didn’t trust Ms. Warren’s plan to hold off on Medicare for All until late in her first term. Now is the time, he said, practically pounding the podium. “In the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for All.” The message was clear: Warrenism, which would wait until year three to fight for single-payer, was insufficiently devoted to the revolutionary cause.</p>
      <p>These exchanges illustrate the Democratic Party’s growing uneasiness with Ms. Warren and her brand of fussy technocratic populism, which can come across as both too radical and too timidly wonky at the same time.</p>
      <p>Throughout her campaign, Ms. Warren has attempted to occupy a middle ground between the party’s moderate wing and its progressive base. But her have-it-both-ways strategy may well have backfired. Despite Ms. Warren’s ascension to the primary’s top tier, the steadiness of Mr. Biden’s polling and the recent rise of Mr. Buttigieg in Iowa and New Hampshire — along with the dips in Ms. Warren’s own polling — suggest not only the limits of her strategy but the limitations of the underlying worldview itself.</p>
      <p>Ms. Warren’s appeal, as a recent <a href="http://echeloninsights.com/wp-content/uploads/Omnibus-October-2019_Party.pdf">survey</a> from Echelon Insights suggests, turns out to be strongest with a relatively narrow slice of the Democratic coalition — the college-educated, culturally liberal Acela voters who just happen to dominate the corridors of elite power.</p>
      <p>And what Democratic voters, at least in Iowa, appear to be worried about is the possibility that Ms. Warren’s appeal might not be broad enough to defeat the man in the White House. Mr. Buttigieg’s and Mr. Biden’s implicit charge was that Ms. Warren doesn’t trust the American people, but the question now is whether Democratic voters trust her.</p>
