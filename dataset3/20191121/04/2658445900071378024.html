      <h3>Joseph Jibueze</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The youth must discover their innate potential and work hard to achieve it if they are to contribute to national development, a lawyer Mr Francis Moneke, has said.</p>
      <p>According to him, it requires “sheer exercise of will and self-discipline” to achieve one’s potential in any endeavour.</p>
      <p>“Without self-discipline and enthusiasm, nothing meaningful can ever be achieved or accomplished,” Moneke said.</p>
      <p>The lawyer, who is the Executive Director, Human Rights and Empowerment Project Ltd/GTE (HREP), spoke in Lagos at a one-day youth mentoring/empowerment seminar.</p>
      <p>The event had a large turnout of youths, including the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members, undergraduates and students.</p>

      <p>Speakers included political economist Prof Pat Utomi, National Open University (NOUN) Deputy Vice-Chancellor Prof Joy Eyisi, Development Dynamics founder Dr Jude Ohanele, Managing Partner, Kevin Martin Ogwemoh Legal Mrs Priscilla Ogwemoh and technocrat Mr Kingsley Eze.</p>
      <p>Referring to Brian Tracy, Moneke said self-discipline is the key to personal greatness and the “magic” that opens doors.</p>
      <p>“With self-discipline, the average person can rise as far and as fast as his talent and intelligence can take him.</p>
      <p>“But, without self-discipline, a person with every blessing of background, education and opportunity will seldom rise above mediocrity,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said the seminar’s objective was to build youth capacity and positively change their orientation.</p>
      <p>“The aim is to build a critical mass of Nigerian youths who will sooner than later become agents of change to transform Nigeria, which is in dire need of a new breed of progressive, honest and patriotic Nigerians,” Moneke.</p>
      <p>For Dr Ohanele, youths should not be afraid to take the next step, especially those who want to become entrepreneurs.</p>
      <p>He said: “You need to take action. You don’t need all the money in the world to start something. You need to manage your money and energy wisely. Don’t waste them. Learn from your mistakes. You need the courage to be different, to walk a different path.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Ogwemoh urged them to set career objectives and milestones – short, medium and long-term goals.</p>
      <p>She said: “You must determine the path you choose. Take courses and obtain qualifications that will enhance your opportunities. Ensure you develop skills.</p>
      <p>“To grow in your career, you need to meet as many people as possible, so networking is important.”</p>
