      <p>Reuters reports the latest comments from the former People’s Bank of China (PBOC) Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, as he says that China still has room for further rate cuts.</p>
      <p>However, he adds that he is unclear whether that can effectively avert a potential financial crisis.</p>
      <p>The headlines failed to impress the Yuan markets, as the Chinese currency remains under pressure vs, the US dollar near three-week lows. USD/CNY hit multi-week highs of 7.0450 in the opening trades before receding to now trade near 7.0390, still up 0.10% on the day.</p>
