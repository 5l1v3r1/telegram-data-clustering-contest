      <h1>Spurs news: Jose Mourinho's transfer talks, Nemanja Matic's response, Liverpool hero's warning</h1>
      <h2>The latest Tottenham news as Jose Mourinho prepares for his first game in charge of Spurs against West Ham on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T04:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Warlow</a></address>
      <p>It has been a whirlwind couple of days for Tottenham Hotspur and the club's supporters.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the week, Mauricio Pochettino was planning for the return of players from international duty ahead of the game against West Ham United at the London Stadium this weekend.</p>
      <p>But things change quickly in football and after the club announced that Pochettino had left Tottenham on Tuesday night, less than 12 hours later, Jose Mourinho had already been confirmed as his replacement.</p>
      <p>As such, Mourinho is now preparing to take charge of <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a> for the first time this weekend against the Hammers, having led training with his new players yesterday afternoon (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>Mourinho is set to face the media today (Thursday) ahead of the weekend's early kick off on Saturday, and we at <b>football.london</b> will be bringing you all the latest news from that this afternoon.</p>
      <p>But ahead of that, we take a look at what Mourinho's appointment means for Spurs and some of the Tottenham stars, among the latest news, below.</p>
      <h3>Jose Mourinho's to-do list</h3>
      <p>It was straight to work for new Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho as he started life at the club on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old started work bright and early, having slept over at the training ground's five star hotel, The Lodge, and he quickly got his affairs in order at the north London club, with his coaching staff confirmed by the club yesterday afternoon (Wednesday).</p>
      <p>But Mourinho and his staff will have plenty on the to-do list over the next few days, as Spurs look to bridge the 11-point gap that currently stands between them and the top four in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>One of those will be transfer talks with Daniel Levy ahead of the January window, with Mourinho set to assess his current squad over the next few days and weeks, before delivering his wishlist for the new year.</p>
      <p>Spurs have made funds available for him should he need them and while the former Chelsea boss is believed to be coming in with a new philosophy, a new outlook on football in keeping with his new project, he will still want to have a squad capable of adding more silverware to his CV.</p>
      <p>That means decisions will need to be made over the futures of players like Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, who are out of contract in the summer.</p>
      <p>But first, the most important thing is to get Spurs winning again, with Tottenham only having three victories so far in the Premier League this season.</p>

      <h3>Nemanja Matic responds to transfer talk</h3>
      <p>It did not take long for Nemanja Matic to start being linked with a move to Tottenham, following Jose Mourinho's appointment.</p>
      <p>The Serbian midfielder has played 159 games under Mourinho at Chelsea and Manchester United - significantly more than any other manager - and he was part of the Blues side that won the Premier League title and League Cup with the now-Spurs boss in 2015.</p>

      <p>Following Mourinho's arrival in north London, some Manchester United fans took to social media to suggest that Matic could follow in his footsteps.</p>
      <p>But with rumours circulating as to who the new Spurs boss will target during the January transfer window, <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/transfer-news/nemanja-matic-responds-rumours-man-17289828">the player himself has also taken to social media</a> to respond to talk of a move.</p>
      <p>The Manchester United man has replied on an Instagram post by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bewarmers/?hl=en">BenchWarmers</a> , suggesting that Matic is waiting for Mourinho to make a January approach.</p>
      <p>He replied with two emojis, one clapping and one laughing.</p>
      <p>Matic does not feature among the players Tottenham have been tipped to sign in January though, with six players who could link up with Mourinho priced at odds of 10/1 or shorter.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Jamie Carragher's warning</h3>
      <p>There has already been plenty of debate about the style of football Mourinho will get Spurs playing, following his appointment.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss brings with him an impressive track record on trophies, but he has often faced criticism for tactics that are perceived to be negative - which was a major sticking point for Manchester United fans.</p>
      <p>However, former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has warned that he will not change his ways at <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a>, but claims that this is something that the club's hierarchy will have already come to terms with.</p>

      <p>“There will be concern over the style and that’s not just after Pochettino, Tottenham are known to play a certain way, similar to what Manchester United supporters spoke about when Jose got the job there,” he told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“So that could be a problem going forward if it’s a similar style of football to what he produced at Manchester United but Jose has his way of doing things and he’s not going to change for Tottenham.</p>
      <p>“They brought Jose Mourinho in because they think he can win trophies and he’ll do it his way."</p>
