      <p>While anecdotal, there was a troublesome titbit of information in recently released <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Sherry+FitzGerald">Sherry FitzGerald</a> research.</p>
      <p>The estate agent noted a slowdown in sales closures primarily due to problems arising from utility connection issues, typically to water mains.</p>
      <p>Though this may seem relatively inconsequential, two issues arise here. First, a person who has paid a deposit on a home is delayed from moving, thereby most likely prolonging their stay in rented accommodation. Second, a developer is stymied from continuing construction on a second phase of a project if they haven’t received the funds to pay for the first phase of construction.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t take a genius to see why these two outcomes may be problematic, particularly when this State is burdened by an ongoing housing crisis.</p>
      <p>There is some logic to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=ESB">ESB</a> or Irish Water saying that, rather than connecting three houses, they’ll wait until 10 are completed before they’ll call out. Connecting at scale is a more efficient use of time.</p>
      <h3>Concern</h3>
      <p>But it’s never going to be considerably more financially efficient, given that the main gain is the time taken to travel to and from a construction site.</p>
      <p>And with new homes desperately needed, particularly around the capital, the time saved shouldn’t be the foremost concern, at least not for State-linked bodies.</p>
      <p>The problems around slow delivery of housing stock are often attributed to developer-caused delays. But bodies linked to the State are clearly complicit in the hold-up.</p>
      <p>And while one can begin to understand the difficulty around shifting land, hindrances in the form of utility connections are inexcusable.</p>
      <p>One source in the industry said developers are – unusually – slow to put their head above the parapet on this for fear their project will be put to the back of the queue.</p>
      <p>In the absence of their interventions, however, the process of housebuilding won’t become smoother any time soon.</p>
