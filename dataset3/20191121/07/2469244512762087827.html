      <p>The Exeter-based Met Office is urging people to prepare for severe weather.</p>
      <p>The national weather forecaster's latest research suggests two thirds of British people have been caught out by severe weather, despite regularly checking the weather forecast. </p>
      <p>The Met Office's Press Office said: "Half of those surveyed (50 per cent) say being caught out by the extreme weather was due to lack of preparation, resulting in illness (13 per cent) missing out on work (22 per cent) and cancelling social plans (20 per cent).</p>
      <p>"Whilst a third of us check the forecast to find out what to wear, the Met Office is urging everyone to think beyond day-to-day clothing choices and make sure vital checks are carried out on homes, vehicles and neighbours to avoid disruption from extreme weather.</p>
      <p>"A huge 74% of those surveyed don’t think they are ready for winter, with 20 per cent admitting that they only start winter preparations, such as checking their boiler and pipes and stocking up their freezer, in December.  This is despite the biggest cited disruption from bad weather being boilers breaking down and pipes bursting."</p>
      <p>The Met Office WeatherReady initiative is about encouraging people to be prepared for and cope with extreme weather.</p>
      <p>More severe winter weather in recent years, including heavy rainfall and snow, hasn’t encouraged us to focus on preparation in 2019 with only a third (34 per cent) of people saying they’ll take extra steps this year. Although more than a quarter (27 per cent) check the weather up to ten times a week, the same small percentage spend time preparing their winter wardrobe (27 per cent) and getting their house ready (22 per cent).</p>
      <p>When it comes to more specific preparations, less than half ensure their car is ready for winter weather (39%), just a third get a flu jab (33 per cent), 29 per cent check their pipes and only 11 per cent check their flood risk.</p>
      <p>Winter preparation is not just about your home, but also your community, with 23 per cent of Brits saying that they would check on an elderly or vulnerable neighbour in the event of a severe weather warning.</p>
      <p>Madeleine Alessandri - Deputy National Security Advisor, Cabinet Office, <b> </b> comments “The Met Office’s WeatherReady campaign is a helpful reminder to prepare for the possible effects of severe winter weather.</p>
      <p>Whilst our public and emergency services carry out their usual winter preparatory work, all of us can take a few small steps that could make a big difference in adverse conditions.  Please take a moment to consider how your home, health and travel may be affected by the winter weather and take action now to prepare”.</p>
      <p>Will Lang, Head of Civil Contingencies at The Met Office, says “Changeable weather is a fact of life throughout the winter months as the recent heavy rainfall and flooding has shown us.</p>
      <p>As we approach winter, it is important to know where you can access expert advice and guidance to help you prepare for the potential impacts of severe weather. Taking a small amount of time to prepare now can make a big difference in keeping family, friends and neighbours, as well as property and businesses safe throughout the months ahead.”</p>
