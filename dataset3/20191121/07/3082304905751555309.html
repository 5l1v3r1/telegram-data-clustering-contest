      <p>22-year-old<a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/fifa-wc-asian-qualifiers/1200371/safawi-rasid-scores-brace-as-malaysia-pile-more-misery-on-indonesia-2-0-in-fifa-world-cup-qualifiers/"> Safawi, who scored a brilliant brace for the senior national team against Indonesia in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers this week</a>, was expected to strengthen Malaysia U-23s’ hopes of winning a gold medal in the men’s football competition of the multi-sport event.</p>
      <p>However, Malaysia U-23 head coach Ong Kim Swee has now decided to not call up Safawi to the squad despite including seven of the senior internationals who were part of<i> Harimau Malaya’s</i> 2-0 win over Indonesia the other day.</p>
      <p>Adam Nor Azlin, Dominic Tan, Haziq Nadzli, Syamer Kutty Abba, Akhyar Rashid, Syahmi Safari and Daniel Amier Norhisham are the seven senior Malaysia internationals Kim Swee has included in his preliminary squad who are training at the MPSJ Stadium in Selangor.</p>

      <p>“It was a difficult decision for me to make. Safawi deserves a break as he has played too many matches for both country and club this year,” the Malaysian coach was quoted as saying <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/sports/football/2019/11/540643/safawi-not-sea-games-squad">by the <i>New Straits Times.</i></a></p>
      <p>“Safawi needs the rest as we have an important schedule next year. I was the one who made the decision and Safawi himself understands why he was not called up. It is for his own good as well as for JDT and the national team. I hope everyone will understand,” Kim Swee said about the Malaysia Super League 2019 Player of the Year.</p>
