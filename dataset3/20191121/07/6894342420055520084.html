      <h1>HONOR Teases At MagicBook Notebook; Coming To Malaysia Soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:30:40+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/john/" target="_blank">John Law</a></address>
      <p>Earlier at the HONOR 9X launch, HONOR teased the crowd with a brief announcement of its MagicBook thin and light notebook. According to HONOR, the brand says that it has plans on making its self-branded ultrabook available in Malaysia “very soon”, but stopped short of specifying an exact date.</p>
      <p>While the launch date still remains a mystery, we at least managed to get our hands on one of two MagicBook units that were on display during the event, albeit with limited access. I say limited access because, while allowed to throw it around physically, we were prohibited from turning on the machine. As the HONOR staff present didn’t want us to check the specifications of the notebook.</p>
      <p>One reason they gave us for the restricted access was that its refreshed MagicBook had not yet launched in China, and as such, the main HONOR office in China had issued orders not to reveal any such information. Ironically, we know for a fact that the MagicBook present at the event today was running on an AMD Ryzen 5 mobile CPU. And while they, once again, refused to tell us which SKU it was, it’s very likely to be a Ryzen 5-3500U.</p>

      <p>Beyond that, no other information about the MagicBook was made available by the brand.</p>
      <p>Regarding its build quality and design, it’s not wrong to say that the MagicBook looks nearly identical to Huawei’s own MateBook thin and light notebook. From the keyboard and trackpad placement on the base, right down to the power button location and pop-up camera.</p>

      <p>On another note, HONOR also teased the imminent arrival of the successor to its MagicWatch wearable, the MagicWatch 2. Alas, like the MagicBook, no specific launch date was provided, with only the words “Coming soon to Malaysia” being shown alongside the silhouette of the alleged smartwatch.</p>

      <p>Hopefully, HONOR will share the launch date of these items soon. Until then, we’re just going to have wait in anticipation.</p>
