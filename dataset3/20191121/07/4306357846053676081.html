      <h3>Michael Owen is backing Manchester City to return to winning ways against Chelsea FC at The Etihad on Saturday evening.</h3>
      <p>The defending Premier League champions suffered a 3-1 loss to league leaders Liverpool FC at Anfield in their last top-flight outing before the international break.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s side have some ground to make up if the Citizens want to retain their Premier League crown for a third successive season under the Spanish head coach.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC are in third position in the Premier League table and a point ahead of the title holders following an excellent run of results in the top flight.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard’s young side have won their last six Premier League games to hoist themselves into the top four and remain within eight points of leaders Liverpool FC.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC striker Owen is anticipating a high-scoring game between Manchester City and Chelsea FC but the pundit believes the Citizens will find a way to win.</p>
      <p>“The game of the weekend is at the Etihad and champions Manchester City will leapfrog Chelsea in the table if they take all three points,” Lampard told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“City won the corresponding game 6-0 last season but Chelsea did win the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season and only penalties were able to split the sides at Wembley in the League Cup Final back in February.</p>
      <p>“After their defeat at Anfield in their previous game City cannot afford to drop points, especially at the Etihad, if they are to put pressure on Liverpool in their quest for a hat-trick of titles.</p>
      <p>“Chelsea have improved under Frank Lampard and their exciting young side are confident and talented. But beware a wounded Pep Guardiola and his side – it will have been a long international break for the City boss.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC appointed Lampard as their new manager back in the summer after Maurizio Sarri quit the west London side to take over the reins at Serie A champions Juventus.</p>
      <p>Lampard has been praised for giving Chelsea FC youngsters a chance to shine, such as Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori.</p>
