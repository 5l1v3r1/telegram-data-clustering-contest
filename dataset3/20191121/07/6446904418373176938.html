      <p>COLDPLAY WON’T BE touring to promote their latest album because of the impact worldwide music tours have on the environment.</p>
      <p>Lead singer Chris Martin <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">told the BBC</a>: “All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job.</p>
      <blockquote>We’re taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial.</blockquote>
      <p>Martin said the band would be “disappointed” if their next tour is not carbon neutral. He told the BBC he wants a tour with no single-use plastics used and have it largely solar-powered.</p>
      <p>“Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” he said. “We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much giving as taking?”</p>
      <p>Martin added that he hoped this measure would have a “positive impact”, given the impact on the environment of embarking on a multi-city music tour.</p>
      <p>The last tour the British group embarked on saw them take in 122 shows across four continents in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>That tour grossed more than $500 million (€450 million) in ticket sales, making it the third-highest grossing in history.</p>
      <p>Coldplay will play two shows this week in the Jordanian capital Amman that are set to be streamed live on YouTube.</p>
      <p>They’re also set to perform a concert in London’s National History Museum next week, with proceeds going to an environmental charity. </p>
