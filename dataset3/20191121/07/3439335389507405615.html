      <p>Utility work on Farrington Highway in Maili will require a lane closure between 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Friday, affecting Makaha-bound traffic, according to the Hawaiian Electric Co.</p>
      <p>Hawaiian Electric crews will replace utility poles, and work on electrical infrastructure, in two separate areas along Farrington Highway near Maili Beach Park.</p>
      <p>The far right, Makaha-bound lane of Farrington will be closed for infrastructure work between Kaukamana and Mana streets, and also for the replacement of three utility poles between Keliikipi and Liliana Streets.</p>
      <p>Access to the sidewalk and bike lane in both areas will be allowed when conditions are safe.</p>
      <p>Motorists should exercise caution when approaching and passing the work area. Traffic cones will be placed around the work site, and special duty police will be on-site to assist with traffic control.</p>
