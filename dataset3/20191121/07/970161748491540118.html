        <b>Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan are officially free from each other as a judge has finalised their divorce almost two years after their split.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former couple, who married in 2009 three years after meeting on the set of Step Up, announced their split in April 2018.</p>
      <p>It’s now reported that a judge has granted their request to legally separate while they discuss custody agreements and a property settlement. Channing and Jenna recently filed papers asking for the divorce so that they have the option to settle down with their new partners.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/20/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-legally-single-divorce/">According to TMZ</a>, documents filed by Jenna’s lawyer Samantha Spector indicate the divorce judgement was announced on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The former spouses now have to work out a custody agreement for their six-year-old daughter Everly whom they are currently co-parenting.</p>
      <p>Jenna, 38, was the first to file for the divorce.</p>
      <p>Both Channing, 39, and Jenna have moved on with other people – the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/well-arent-jessie-j-channing-tatum-just-two-adorable-kids-love-10967167/">Magic Mike actor is currently dating British singer Jessie J</a>, while his ex-wife is <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/pregnant-jenna-dewan-glowing-cradles-baby-bump-takes-santa-monica-11188072/">in a relationship wit Shameless actor Steve Kazee</a>, and is currently pregnant with their first child.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1083560/jenna-dewan-and-channing-tatum-finalize-their-divorce">A source told E! News</a>: ‘Jenna plans to marry Steve and is so in love with him. They have had many long and open talks about that and it’s definitely the plan.</p>
      <p>‘What matters most though is that she and Steve are fully committed and so excited to have a baby and grow their family. She knows they will be engaged and married soon enough.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/17/jenna-dewan-initially-blindsided-channing-tatums-relationship-jessie-j-10938977/">Jenna opened up about her split from Channing</a> in her new wellness book, explaining: ‘I’d come to realise the dynamic I was in wasn’t serving me nor was it serving my daughter.</p>
      <p>‘First and foremost I had to accept the realisation this isn’t working and had moved into hurting. The public saw Channing and I in this idealised romanticised light. This made things difficult for me because I like being as honest and real as I can.’</p>
