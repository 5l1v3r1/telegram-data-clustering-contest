      <h2>WARNING - DISTRESSING DETAILS: The 27-year-old man accused of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane, 21, in Auckland, New Zealand, was “just a young man prepared to do what his sexual partners want him to do", his lawyer says</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:07:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:07</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen D'Antal</a></address>
      <p>Grace Millane encouraged her alleged murderer to choke her and to "apply more force" as they had rough sex, his lawyer told a jury.</p>
      <p>In his closing speech, barrister Ian Brookie said the defendant was “just a young man prepared to do what his sexual partners want him to do in the bedroom," his lawyer told the jury.</p>
      <p>Mr Brookie told a New Zealand court it was “abundantly clear” that the British backpacker, from Wickford, Essex, liked to be choked during sex and that she and the defendant "were not thinking of it as a dangerous act".</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old suspect had claimed to police that Grace, 21, had told him she learned BDSM techniques with a former partner and he could not have known that any other way.</p>
      <p>Mr Brookie told Auckland's High Court: “It was part of the sexual act they were doing and it was fun. He was not experienced enough to actually know how to do this properly and what the dangers actually were.</p>

      <p>“They were in the heat of the moment together, their judgement and perceptions were impaired by alcohol. They were focused on having sex.</p>
      <p>“What they were doing, putting pressure in each others’ necks, is now just a part of having sex for some people.</p>
      <p>“They were not thinking of it as a dangerous act.</p>
      <p>“She was encouraging him to do this and to apply more force because this what she liked.”</p>

      <p>The idea, he said, was not violence or pain, but to heighten her sexual pleasure, but their inexperience, coupled with alcohol, meant safety was not their priority, said Mr Brookie.</p>
      <p>He added: “He reached orgasm and went to the shower. He never for a moment considered that Miss Millane might be in trouble.”</p>
      <p>Miss Millane was last seen alive on the night of December 1, 2018 - the eve of her 22nd birthday - as she entered Auckland's CityLife Hotel with the defendant.</p>
      <p>She was on a round-the-world trip when she arrived in New Zealand and went on a Tinder date with the man now accused of her murder.</p>

      <p>The Crown has alleged that the defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, strangled the young woman during rough sex and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.</p>
      <p>The defence claims the death was accidental.</p>
      <p>Mr Brookie told the court there was no physical evidence of an assault and the accused had put sustained pressure on her neck because “that’s what he thought he was supposed to be doing".</p>
      <p>The barrister admitted that on their date the man may have told Grace a “white lie” about being an oil company manager, but only because “he is insecure, single, he is trying to find a relationship, trying to impress girls".</p>

      <p>And after her death, the man lied time and again about the events but he had panicked and although he had “acted selfishly” and what he did was “unacceptable” it only meant he was unable to cope in a crisis.</p>
      <p>“The stakes were high,” he said. “This is not knocking over a milk jug, this is someone dead on his floor. It looks terrible.”</p>
      <p>Mr Brookie said the prosecution’s attempt to prove seven intimate photos taken of Miss Millane were after her death rested on two internet searches he made minutes before.</p>
      <p>They were for “Waitakere Ranges”, the hills where he later buried her body in a suitcase, and “hottest fire”.</p>

      <p>The first, Mr Brookie said, “could have been about where they going to go the next day. She was a visitor to New Zealand,” he said.</p>
      <p>The second "could mean anything”.</p>
      <p>They could, he suggested, be part of the “phenomenon of the random Google search”, which was “common during drunken conversations".</p>
      <p>The defendant, who chose not to give evidence, told police in an interview that he and Miss Millane had taken pictures of each others’ genitals during sex.</p>
      <p>And he admitted throwing away the Brit's phone in a rubbish bin in the park. This, said Mr Brookie, was “an ill advised move because that phone contains evidence that helps him".</p>

      <p>“This is not murder,” said Mr Brookie, “it’s a tragic, unintended, unforeseen accident.”</p>
      <p>Earlier, prosecutor Brian Dickey told jurors in his closing speech that Miss Millane was murdered by a man “seeking total domination and some sort of weird thrill over women who were his sexual partners”.</p>
      <p>And the alleged killer had then taken “trophy photographs” because of a “morbid interest in a dead woman’s genitalia", the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>Mr Dickey added: “It’s not safe sex play that killed Grace Millane, it’s strangulation.</p>
      <p>“At some point of which she lost consciousness and would have become limp and lifeless and he had to carry on.</p>
      <p>“And if that’s not reckless murder someone will have to explain to me what is.”</p>
      <p>Judge Simon Moore will sum up the case on Friday morning before the jury considers its verdict.</p>
