      <p>✨<i><i>Hello, hi, and welcome to </i></i><b><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/wait-you-need-this-beauty-products/">Wait, You Need This</a></b><i>, a weekly series highlighting five brand-spanking-new products the </i>Cosmo<i> beauty team (’sup!) can’t and won’t shut up about. </i>✨</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>TBH, there’s nothing we love more on the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a29541121/cosmo-beauty-youtube-show-hair-products/"><i>Cosmo</i> beauty team</a> than kicking off the week with a brand-new crop of products. Like, sure, being a beauty editor is actual <i>work</i>, but when you get to try the coolest new products the second they launch, it’s hard not to get super effing excited at your desk. This week, we found an <b>expensive-looking (and smelling) <a href="https://www.bathandbodyworks.com/p/into-the-night-eau-de-parfum-024510486.html">perfume</a> that costs $40, a glitzy <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525071&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sephora.com%2Fproduct%2Fkillawatt-foil-freestyle-highlighter-duo-P34908923&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosmopolitan.com%2Fstyle-beauty%2Fbeauty%2Fg29845473%2Fwait-you-need-this-11-21-2019%2F">red highlighter</a> (yes, <i>red</i>), and so much more</b>. Shop them all, ahead, and do yourself a favor and set a reminder to stop by next Thursday for another round of cool new sh*t.</p>

      <p>Every time I wear this <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a29575552/cosmopolitan-fragrance-perfume-awards-2019/">fragrance</a>, I get so many “You smell good” compliments and “Wait, what are you wearing?” questions. Everyone always expects me to name some expensive, bougie brand, so you can probs imagine their surprise when I tell them it’s Bath &amp; Body Works and it costs less than $40. It smells like money, and you barely have to spend any—a couple of spritzes and you’ll be covered in <b>long-lasting notes of berries, jasmine, and amber</b> that give you a fancy and sophisticated vibe.</p>

      <p>Honestly, I’ve yet to try a Fenty Beauty launch I haven’t been immediately obsessed with, but everything about the latest shade of Rihanna’s cult-favorite <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g28966753/liquid-highlighter-makeup/">highlighter</a> has me <i>extra</i> excited. Like, besides the fact that it was obviously named for me (BRB while I change my insta handle to @RubyRichez), <b>I love how different the shimmery red pigment is</b>.<b> </b>I like to wear it on the highest point of my cheekbones (just a tiny lil dab), but I’ve also been experimenting with sweeping it across my eyelids for a subtle wash of color.</p>

      <p>The CeraVe team came to visit me at the <i>Cosmo</i> offices last week to show me their newest serum—the Resurfacing Retinol Serum—and you guys, I was IMPRESSED. It’s designed to fade post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation from old acne marks, minimize the look of pores, and smooth fine lines (so, all of my skin concerns) with a combo of encapsulated <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g25837230/retinol-face-cream/">retinol</a>, niacinamide, licorice root extract, and ceramides. </p>
      <p>I’ve been using it in the morning under my <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g26015502/sunscreen-for-sensitive-skin/">sunscreen</a> (and yes, you can use this retinol in the a.m. since the encapsulation prevents it from degrading in sunlight) and <b>my skin already looks brighter and a little bit smoother</b>. Pretty awesome considering it’s only $20.</p>

      <p>Okay, setting aside the fact that this packaging is hella gorgeous—like, prepare to be all over my Instagram, TY—the formula of this <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g25360983/best-face-serum/">essence</a> is amazing for my sensitive skin. It has exactly one ingredient: 100 percent artemisia annua extract, which is double-fermented sweet wormwood that’s <b>incredibly soothing and anti-inflammatory by nature</b>. I just pat it over my clean, dry skin morning and night, then immediately apply my <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g21950910/best-face-moisturizer-skin-type/">moisturizer</a> to lock in the hydration. Love, love, love.</p>

      <h3>5 Kate McLeod Atelier Stone I</h3>

      <p>I’ve ONLY been using Kate McLeod’s body stone moisturizers on my skin since having my daughter—specifically the <a href="https://www.katemcleod.com/products/mama-stone">Mama Stone</a>, which is safe for breastfeeding—but I’ve recently become obsessed with her limited-edition crystal collab with healer Rashia Bell. First of all, Kate’s formula (a blend of cocoa butter, sweet almond oil, apricot-kernel oil, avocado oil, and fractionated coconut oil) <b>feels like <i>no other </i><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/g12499653/best-body-lotion-moisturizers/">body lotion</a> on your skin</b> and will instantly turn a dry patch around (one stone lasts around four months with daily use, BTW!). </p>
      <p>Fun fact: She used to be a pastry chef and treats her ingredients as she would a chocolate ganache (I mean, so chic), so the stone holds its shape like a sweet treat but melts on (and absorbs into) your skin in the most nongreasy way possible. But this collab takes the meditative experience of rubbing a body stone all over your body to another level thanks to the relaxing vetiver and balancing bergamot it contains—not to mention the crystal heliotrope you walk away with when your stone is done.</p>
