      <h1>Derek Hatton: We can't allow this election to be fought on a single issue</h1>
      <h2>Degsy's verdict on the stories making the news</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/derek-hatton/" target="_blank">Derek Hatton</a></address>
      <p>I reckon even his biggest critics have to admit it: Jeremy Corbyn was very good on Tuesday night, and certainly in a different league to the lying, bumbling Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson. <br/><br/>But once again the blatant bias of the media raised its ugly head.  Johnson speaking time: 1073 seconds, Jeremy Corbyn speaking time was 942 seconds; Johnson interruptions: 74, Corbyn 26. <br/><br/>This was not just allowed by the so-called impartial presenter but at times almost encouraged.<br/><br/>But one thing that emerged, however hard the presenter and Johnson attempted to bring it back to Brexit, was the sheer class alternatives; the human differences between the two leaders and their parties. <br/><br/>Yes of course it was Brexit that triggered this election but there is no way, nor should there be, that a General Election can be fought on a single issue. <br/><br/>This is a General Election about how we all live over the next five years. These are the real questions: how do we remove the necessity of food banks?  How do we ban the Victorian employer/employee relationship that is known as zero-hours contracts? How do we ensure that the National Health Service has the funding it needs, with adequate staff and resources, guaranteeing that people who desperately need attention are not left lying on the hospital  floor to die?<br/><br/>All this has developed while we are in Europe and would continue if we were out of Europe - unless we have a Government committed to public services, not one which would sell the very National Health Service that, however under-funded, is still the envy of the world, and has been in the sights of Johnson’s mate Trump, for many a year. <br/><br/>So let’s continue the push, exposing the real differences between the two main parties. Let’s not allow Brexit to be the single issue, and let's make sure people who may not have been Jeremy Corbyn’s biggest fans see the stark contrast between callousness and caring.<br/><br/>There is no room to sit on the fence. Smart-Alec comments from people, very often Labour Party members, who should know better, do not help Labour win a critical election.<br/><br/>For our children  and grandchildren this is a potentially-life-changing election. Let’s make sure we continue to back what the Labour Party is proposing so that ‘life-changing’ means changing lives for the better.</p>
