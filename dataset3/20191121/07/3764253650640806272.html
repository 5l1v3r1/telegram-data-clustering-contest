      <p><i>“I believe the National Assembly should hold a public hearing on that bill so that due process of lawmaking is followed so that the views of Nigerians not just the governors will be well captured on that bill,"</i> he said.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/vanguard.html">Vanguard</a> reports that the governor also spoke on controversial minimum wage saying his colleagues are currently talking with labour organisations in their states.</p>
      <p><i>"I’m sure it is work in progress before December all the states must have finished working out the details on the issue of minimum <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/minimum-wage.html">wage</a> across the federation,"</i> he said</p>
