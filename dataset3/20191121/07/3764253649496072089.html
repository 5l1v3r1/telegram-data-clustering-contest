From a tender age, he liked the idea of schooling and getting educated, his passion led him to attend school, even when his parents could barely afford it.</p>
      <p>Born in 1957 at Gar village in Alkaleri local government area of <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/bauchi-state-news-today.html">Bauchi</a> state, Haruna spent his early years engaging in farming, selling firewood and bean cake (akara), and other difficult activities to raise money to assist his poor parents who could barely afford his primary and secondary education, Sun News reports.</p>
      <p>Although they were very supportive of his ambition, all they could offer was their love and care and this put the work on Haruna as a young child, to do all he could to pay his fees.</p>
