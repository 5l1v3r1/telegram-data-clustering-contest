      <p>The Indonesian government granted citizenship to Ruqayyah Binti Husein Luceno, the wife of convicted terrorist Umar Patek on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) chief Comr. Gen. Suhardi Alius said that Luceno, a Philippines citizen who had been living in Indonesia since 2009, had applied for Indonesian citizenship 2.5 years ago following Umar’s request. </p>
      <p>“I proceeded with the application as soon as I received it and the Directorate General for Administration and General Law delivered the decree immediately to my office,” Suhardi said, adding that her husband Umar had behaved well in prison and had been cooperative during his sentence.</p>
      <p>He offered to help the Indonesian government in April 2016, when 10 Indonesian sailors were taken hostage by the Abu Sayyaf terror group in Sulu Island, the Philippines.</p>
      <p>Suhardi presented Luceno’s citizenship certificate in a small ceremony at Surabaya Penitentiary in Porong, Sidoarjo, East Java. The event was attended by East Java Police deputy chief Brig. Gen. Djamaludin, Sidoarjo Police deputy chief Sr. Comr. Anggi Naulifar Siregar, as well as representatives from the Indonesian Military and the East Java administration. </p>
      <p>Umar is serving a 20 year sentence for his involvement in the first Bali bombing in 2002. After the Bali bombing, he flew to the Philippines to join Abu Sayyaf. (dpk)</p>
