      <p>After ‘Soorma’ (2018), ‘Saand Ki Aankh’ (2019) and ‘Rashmi Rocket’, Taapsee Pannu is signing on to yet another sports film, this time a biopic on iconic cricketer Mithali Raj.</p>
      <p>Pannu has been in talks for the role since August, and has expressed interest in playing Raj on screen. “She seems to be the right choice for sports films. There are many other actresses playing sportswomen in other films, but they are all having issues getting into athlete mode. Taapsee, who is athletic by nature, seems to be the unanimous choice for such films,” a source told <i>Deccan Chronicle.</i></p>
      <p>The biopic is being produced by Viacom 18 and is being aimed for an early 2021 release.</p>
