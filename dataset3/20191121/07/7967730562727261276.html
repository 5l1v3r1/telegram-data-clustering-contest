      <p>A man accused of breaking into a 76-year-old woman's Perth home and raping her told detectives he was like a "son" to her, but admitted at trial he didn't know her.</p>
      <p>Mugahed Adam Eldouma, 39, allegedly got into the victim's Armadale house on a June afternoon last year through a window, leaving behind fingerprints, then snatched her mobile phone away as she called triple-zero for help.</p>
      <p>The District Court of WA heard on Thursday he punched her in the head and body, then repeatedly sexually assaulted her, leaving her with injuries including teeth marks on her chest.</p>
      <p>He allegedly ran into the backyard when he saw a police car arrive and was swiftly apprehended, telling officers he was her carer.</p>
      <p>Eldouma repeated that claim in a video recorded interview with detectives that evening, saying he'd done a carer's course at TAFE and would visit her once a week or fortnight.</p>
      <p>He insisted he'd known the woman for about two years after meeting her at a shopping centre and would sometimes stay overnight in the shed or on the verandah, even in winter.</p>
      <p>"She's like my mum," Eldouma told detectives.</p>
      <p>"She said 'you're welcome any time'. It's like a good friendship.</p>
      <p>"I love and care for her."</p>
      <p>When detectives told him that the woman said she'd never seen him before that day, Eldouma replied: "That's a lie."</p>
      <p>"She does know me.</p>
      <p>"I'm like a son of hers."</p>
      <p>He also told detectives he believed she was aged 50 or 51, and had a completely different name.</p>
      <p>In a document of signed admissions tendered in court, Eldouma made various concessions including he didn't know the victim, wasn't her carer and had her phone in his possession when arrested.</p>
      <p>He claimed authorities were called after they got into an argument over her medication.</p>
      <p>The woman has since died.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
