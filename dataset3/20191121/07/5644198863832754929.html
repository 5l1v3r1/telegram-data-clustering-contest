      <p>Alibaba will pay its investment banking syndicate up to US$32.3 million for leading its Hong Kong listing which will raise up to US$12.9 billion, according to documents filed with U.S. securities regulators.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: China's Alibaba will pay its investment banking syndicate up to US$32.3 million for leading its Hong Kong listing which will raise up to US$12.9 billion, according to documents filed with U.S. securities regulators.</p>
      <p>The e-commerce giant employed two co-sponsors, China International Capital Corp (CICC) and Credit Suisse , to head the deal which has been carried out over the past week.</p>

      <p>The two lead banks were joined by Citigroup Inc , JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley as joint global co-ordinators while HSBC and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) were appointed as junior book runners.</p>
      <p>An additional supplementary prospectus lodged with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed Alibaba would pay investment banking fees of US$28.1 million for the sale of 500 million shares.</p>
      <p>This would rise to US$32.3 million if a so-called overallotment of an additional 75 million shares is issued, which bankers think will occur.</p>
      <p>The fee split between the banks was not listed in the SEC documents but it is accepted industry practice that co-sponsors are paid the most and the remaining banks' fees are dependent on the amount of shares sold.</p>
      <p>According to the filings, Citigroup was allotted more shares to sell than JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley as bookrunners.</p>
      <p>A Hong Kong brokerage part-owned by Alibaba founder, Yunfeng Securities, was also listed as being a participant in the deal.</p>
      <p>The investment banks will also benefit from the 1 per cent brokerage fee paid by investors buying stock in the secondary listing.</p>
      <p>Alibaba's payment to banks sits well below the US$90m cheque that Saudi Arabia's Aramco intends to write for the banks working on its slimmed down initial public offering (IPO).</p>
      <p>The highest ever fee payment on a deal was Visa's 2008 IPO in New York which raised US$19.6 billion and led to the company paying its banks US$550.2 million, according to Dealogic data,</p>
      <p>Alibaba's Hong Kong stock is due to start trading next Tuesday.</p>
