      <h1>Your Origin account hasn’t been hacked, it’s just EA being nice</h1>

        <b>You might have gotten an email from EA recently saying that you’ve redeemed an Origin Access membership code – even if you haven’t. Don’t worry, you haven’t been hacked. EA is providing a free month of its base premium subscription to anyone who’s activated extra security measures on their accounts, but a poorly-worded email has led players to believe that their accounts are at risk.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The email is simply titled ‘you’ve redeemed an Origin Access membership code,’ and reads as if you’ve done exactly that – and as <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-scares-the-hell-out-of-origin-users-into-thinking-th-1839958273">Kotaku</a> notes, that’s led to a whole lot of worry from users who understandably believe their accounts have been compromised. <a href="https://twitter.com/EAHelp/status/1197274361545117696">EA’s</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EAHelp/status/1197249946606374912">official</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/EAHelp/status/1197189851977699328">help account</a> has since had to spend the day assuring everyone that their accounts are safe.</p>
      <p>The free month of Origin Access is a bonus for anyone who activated two-factor authentication on their account before October 30. That’ll give you access to a bunch of older games and a selection of trials for newer titles for the duration, and you won’t even have to recover a hacked account to enjoy them.</p>
      <p>You won’t be playing any <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/ea-access-trial">Jedi: Fallen Order trial</a>, though.</p>
      <p>Fingers crossed for better-worded emails going forward.</p>
