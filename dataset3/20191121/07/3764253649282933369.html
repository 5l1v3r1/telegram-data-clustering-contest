      <p>Arthur Nwabufo is a Nigerian that has made the country really proud. He is a navigator and cadet at the Far Eastern State Technical Fisheries University of Russia.</p>
      <p>The Cable reports that Nwabufo is presently on an “around-the-world” expedition on the Pallada as he is also said to be the first citizen of the country to get to the Antarctica on the Russian fleet.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that the Pallada vessel is known to have been built in 1989 at the shipyard of Gdansk in Poland. It is also considered as the pride of the university.</p>
