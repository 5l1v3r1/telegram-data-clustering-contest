      <p>A head teacher who tried to portray himself as a ‘safeguarding champion’ has been jailed after being exposed as a paedophile.</p>
      <p>Daniel Chapman, 31, from Chelmsford, was given a two-and-a-half year sentence after police found that he was making and publishing depraved child abuse images.</p>
      <p>His youngest victim was just four years old, Essex Police said.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable Nick Riley said the six-month investigation ‘involved some of the most horrific social media messaging concerning child abuse that I had ever investigated’.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘Daniel Chapman had taken it upon himself to become a safeguarding champion for the school, whilst he was simultaneously involved in activities which promoted the abuse of children, some of whom were of a similar age to those he was meant to be safeguarding.</p>

      <p>‘He portrayed himself as a respectable head teacher, however, was found to have been using messaging applications and social media to engage in making, possessing and publishing indecent images of children as young as four.</p>
      <p>‘I am delighted this individual is now paying the price for his appalling actions.</p>
      <p>‘Every time an indecent image of a child is viewed, it re-victimises that child over and over again.’</p>
      <p>He admitted 12 offences including making indecent photographs of children, publishing obscene articles, and possessing extreme pornographic images.</p>
      <p>He has been banned from teaching for life and will be on the sex offenders’ register for 10 years.</p>
