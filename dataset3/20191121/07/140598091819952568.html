      <h1>British Airways passengers hit with delays of 'up to 22 hours' after 'technical issue'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/gareth-davies/" target="_blank">Gareth Davies</a></address>
      <p>British Airways passengers have claimed to have been hit with delays of up to 22 hours after the airline struggled to deal with what it described as a "technical issue". </p>
      <p>Flights to and from the UK's two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, were among those worse affected.</p>
      <p>Some 97 flights to and from Heathrow were more than 45 minutes late, and two were cancelled. A further 17 Gatwick flights were also delayed by the same length of time.</p>
      <p>The worst was Flight BA170 from Pittsburgh, in the US, which was more than 12 hours behind schedule.</p>
      <p>Responding to Matthew Perry, who said on Twitter he had been delayed by 22 hours and was left "13 hours from home", British Airways said: "We're sorry for any disruption. Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights, and we are rebooking customers onto alternative flights and offering hotel accommodation where they are unable to continue their journeys tonight."</p>
      <p>Mr Perry was one of dozens complaining to the airline on Twitter, which by Thursday morning had become littered with angry messages directed at the airline.</p>
      <p>Another passenger, giving his name as Paul, said he had his flight from Gatwick to Orlando cancelled without warning. </p>
      <p>He said: "So, no update from BA on here aside from replies to other people stating a 'technical issue', but no mention of what that issue is. Some more detail would make people less angry.</p>
      <p>"Getting no reply when you reply to others faster, having to go to the airport to sort and having to find out more information via newspapers isn’t very good for a company the size of BA. Almost as if they don’t want you to know what the problems actually are."</p>
      <p>It is the latest in a long line of damaging incidents for the airline which has seen it slide down the airline rankings.</p>
      <p>Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel magazine, said: "This is the latest in a long line of British Airways technical glitches causing delays and cancellations and yet again it's thousands of passengers who are paying the price - left tired, frustrated and with a lack of information and assistance from the airline.</p>
      <p>"BA must do the right thing and reroute passengers as quickly as possible, using other airlines where necessary, as well as informing customers facing disruption about their entitlement to compensation."</p>
      <h3>The passengers stranded miles from home</h3>
      <p>Those trying to get home to loved ones have been reduced to messaging British Airways directly on social media in a desperate attempt for answers. </p>
      <p>Anger appears to be building, with the airline directing those delayed to a news page of its website with no general update on flight status nor an explanation of what is happening at its airport. </p>
      <p>Many of the responses ask the passengers to privately message British Airways, a common tactic used by companies who do not want their dirty laundry aired in public. </p>
      <p>Here are just some of those passengers affected by the disruption: </p>

      <h3>The litany of BA’s IT woes</h3>
      <p>Two years ago, an outage led to more than 75,000 people being stuck at Heathrow and Gatwick during a busy Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
      <p>More than 700 flights were cancelled over the space of three days in May, leaving the company with an £80m fine as a result.</p>
      <p>A disconnected power supply at a data centre, that was eventually reconnected, caused damage and led to the issues that faced the British airline.</p>
      <p>British Airways warned that only flights before 6pm would be delayed or cancelled, before deciding to ground all flights for the remainder of the day when the outages ensued.</p>
      <p>In August of the same year, passengers described "total chaos" at London airports after the company experienced a failure with a check-in system.</p>
      <p>People were forced to stand in queues for up to four hours due to tighter immigration checks, and were left without their luggage for an extended period.</p>
      <p>Then, last summer, passengers faced yet another spell of delays and cancellations due to issues with British Airways' computer systems.</p>
      <p>Passengers arriving at Heathrow's Terminal 5 were told IT failures had halted flights, adding to delays caused by a fire alert at an air traffic control tower. Some were left delayed for more than 15 hours.</p>
      <p>And in August this year, an IT outage left thousands stranded and unable to check-in online in an incident that caused havoc at Britain’s busiest airports.</p>
      <p>Passengers at London’s Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports were forced to check-in manually, after a glitch hit the company’s check-in and flight departure systems.</p>
      <p>More than 200 flights were delayed, while almost 100 have been cancelled between Heathrow and Gatwick.</p>
      <p>Though British Airways has said this was not a global outage, therewas a knock-on effect to other airports across the world.</p>
      <p>And in September the airline was forced to tell passengers not to turn up at airports due to a pilots' strike over pay.</p>
      <p><i>The Telegraph </i>has contacted British Airways for comment, but nobody was immediately available.</p>
