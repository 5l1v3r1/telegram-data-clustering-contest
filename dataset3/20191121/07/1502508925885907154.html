      <p>The opposition Congress on Thursday staged protests in Lok Sabha against privatisation of a few PSUs, including Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), and issuance of electoral bonds, terming the move as "big scams".</p>
      <p>However, Congress members returned to their seats after the protests and sloganeering in the Well of the House for about 15 minutes when Speaker Om Birla assured them that they will be allowed to raise issues during Zero Hour.</p>
      <p>"This is a big scam. The country is being looted. Please allow us to speak," Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.</p>
      <p>However, Speaker Birla told members that the MPs should not lower the dignity of the House by coming into the Well.</p>
      <p>"This is wrong. The House is discussing a very important issue on sports persons. No, no. Don't talk to the chair from the Well. It is the responsibility of every member to maintain decorum and dignity of the House," he said.</p>
      <p>The Speaker said the Question Hour is very important and the MPs should not disrupt proceedings.</p>
      <p>"I am a new member. You are senior. Don't come to the Well. Maintain the convention," Birla said, adding he has not admitted the adjournment motion moved by the Congress but is ready to allow the party to speak during Zero Hour.</p>
      <p>With this the Congress MPs went to their seats.</p>
