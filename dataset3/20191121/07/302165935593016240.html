      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Malaysian photographer David Lok was lucky enough to quit smoking just two years after he took his first puff.</p>
      <p>The renowned shutterbug used to swipe cigarettes from his father’s stash as a youth and would often pool money with friends to buy a pack.</p>
      <p>A chance encounter with an unfiltered cigarette finally made Lok question if the habit was worth the long-term risks.</p>
      <p>“One day, I stole an unfiltered cigarette from my dad. What happened was that after I smoked it, I coughed the hell out of myself.</p>
      <p>“I was in tears and I thought I was going to die. That made me think, do I really need this? This bad taste in the mouth, all this coughing?</p>
      <p>“That was the last cigarette I ever smoked and I haven’t touched one until now,” he told<i> Malay Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>Prompting people to reflect on themselves is a central element of Lok’s work, which is currently on display at Philip Morris Malaysia’s <i>Unsmoke: Through the Lenses of Malaysians </i>photography exhibition.</p>
      <p>The event is part of the global <i>Unsmoke Your World </i>campaign aimed at prompting smokers to give up the habit and if they can’t, to switch to safer alternatives.</p>

      <p>Lok’s dreamy, cinematic shots draw viewers in to observe the work up close and challenge their perceptions, an attitude that he hopes smokers can adopt in their journeys to go smoke-free.</p>
      <p>“The word ‘unsmoke’ resonates very well with me. I want to encourage people to think, because you don’t usually think much when it comes to habits.</p>
      <p>“I hope my work can provoke people to question what they see and trigger their minds to process and question their perspectives.”</p>
      <p>The photographer also shared how happy he was to see a few of his close friends give up smoking for good, adding that one of them has now become healthy enough to run in marathons.</p>
      <p>Narratives like these are part of Philip Morris International’s (PMI) move to spark a revolution in the tobacco industry and create a smoke-free future, either by getting cigarette users to ditch the habit entirely or move on to smoke-free products.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Embracing a smoke-free world</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lok’s work is currently on display at Colony, Star Boulevard alongside fellow photographers Nadirah Zakariya and SC Shekar.</p>
      <p>Focusing on the purity of a smoke-free world is a cause close to Shekar’s heart, who divides his time between being behind the camera and teaching children from rural schools in East Malaysia about Mother Nature.</p>
      <p>“To me, this is the most important thing I can do. At the end of the day, these children will grow up and make decisions on our behalf,” he shared with <i>Malay Mail</i>.</p>
      <p>The self-described environmentalist uses his photographs — many of which depict the lush landscapes of Malaysia’s rainforests and islands — to help drive the message home to his audience.</p>
      <p>“When you tell children to love the environment, the concept doesn’t become clear until you show them a picture.”</p>
      <p>He hopes that visitors can take away a sense of hope and optimism from his photographs and have faith that nature will bounce back if given the chance to flourish without human interference.</p>

      <p>The beauty of going smoke-free also comes through in Nadirah’s work, which sees delicate flowers blooming from ashtrays and scattered across sidewalks in place of unsightly cigarette buds.</p>
      <p>Her photographs depict a utopian world where going smoke-free allows people to adopt a more playful and carefree attitude towards life.</p>
      <p>“To me, an ‘Unsmoke’ world is a beautiful world. I’m a portrait photographer but in my downtime, I love shooting flowers. I think they’re wild and organic and ever-changing.</p>
      <p>“I don’t smoke myself and I think that’s why I was excited about this campaign. I’m all for getting people to move in the right direction and give up smoking if they can.</p>
      <p>“It’s not easy, but I think where there’s a will, there’s definitely a way. As long as you’re transforming yourself and changing into a better you, I’m all for it,” she told Malay Mail.</p>

      <p>The World Health Organisation predicts that the number of smokers worldwide will exceed one billion by 2025.</p>
      <p>This makes PMI’s<i> Unsmoke Your World</i> campaign a timely initiative to kickstart historic change in public health by urging smokers to either quit the habit or switch over to smoke-free alternatives.</p>
      <p>Curated by Lim Wei Ling, the <i>Unsmoke: Through the Lenses of Malaysians </i>exhibition will run from November 22 to December 1 at Colony, Star Boulevard on Jalan Yap Kwan Seng. Admission is free of charge.</p>
