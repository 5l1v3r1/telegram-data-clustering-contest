      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>’s plans to build an amphitheatre on his Wyoming ranch might have a slight hold up as officials are not happy with him starting building work before getting planning permission.</p>
      <p>The rapper, 42, has apparently been told to stop construction after he broke ground on the property without having a permit.</p>
      <p>Kanye had submitted his proposal to build a 70,684 square door amphitheatre on his Monster Lake Ranch, and hired a construction crew to start digging up the land where the building will be situated.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that the construction team were told to stop the works after Wyoming county officials visited the site as part of his planning applications, but saw in later visits that their instructions had been ignored and that work had continued.</p>
      <p>As well as getting on the wrong side of the planning committee by ignoring their orders, Knaye has also apparently changed the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/kim-kardashian-rows-husband-kanye-west-religious-journey-became-strict-dad-11048054/">use of the building from a ‘meditation space’</a> to residential use.</p>

      <p>The planning application was due to be discussed by the Park County Planning and Zoning Commission on Tuesday, but didn’t make it into the meeting as Kanye had submitted the changes just hours earlier.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that Kanye will now be receiving a letter from the County to tell him that he must stop all construction until he submits a new building permit application as he has changed the intended use of the building.</p>

      <p>‘Kim is definitely not moving and living full-time in Wyoming right now. Kim likes visiting Wyoming, but she sees it more like a vacation place,’ an insider told TMZ.</p>
      <p>‘It’s very quiet and private. Every time they go, they enjoy it. But they are usually comfortable in luxury housing.</p>
      <p>‘The ranch only has simple housing. It’s mostly cabins with no amenities at all. Kim just isn’t a fan of the cabins.</p>
      <p>‘There are many things that need to happen before she and the kids can spend more time there. Kim has a whole list of things. They would need to build a house so everyone can be comfortable.</p>

      <p>‘And now, when everyone knows Kanye bought the ranch, there needs to be an elaborate security system put in.’</p>
