      <h1>Josh van der Flier happy to be back in a Leinster jersey after Rugby World Cup</h1>
      <h2>For van der Flier the intensity of international rugby appeals in a different way to life with the provinces</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>The body language of Leinster's returning World Cup veterans last Saturday suggested they had thrown off the pressurised shackles of Test rugby.</p>
      <p>Johnny Sexton punched the air in delight after scoring his try while Garry Ringrose glided across the RDS turf, capping his display with his first-ever hat-trick.</p>
      <p>But another Blues star on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rugby-world-cup-2019">the World Cup</a> rebound - Josh van der Flier - insists it's not as simple as throwing off the shackles of pressure rugby at Test level for Ireland for a simpler, more satisfying club game.</p>
      <p>For van der Flier and, most likely, for Sexton, Ringrose and the rest, the intensity of international rugby appeals in a different way to life with the provinces.</p>
      <p>Asked if there was just more joy in playing for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leinster-rugby">Leinster</a> as opposed to Ireland, van der Flier replied: "It's hard to say, really.</p>

      <p>"It's definitely a greater honour to play for your country. Any time you're wearing a green jersey is really, really special.</p>
      <p>"There's less of those grind-out, really-tight games with club rugby. </p>
      <p>"And especially with the World Cup where everyone is playing the biggest game of their life every game, which is what it seemed like with every team we were playing against.</p>
      <p>"Whereas it's a bit less ground out, if that makes sense, a bit more open. I enjoyed it (in Japan), I had a great time. I enjoyed the World Cup as well but, yeah, it was good to be back in blue anyway.</p>
      <p>"I like a bit of both, to be honest. I really enjoy the games which are a bit more open and you get a bit more ball in hand.</p>
      <p>"But, then, I do love the physical side of it, the real tight games, when there's a lot of tackling and scrappy ball to deal with. I kind of enjoy that, I don't want it to be too much of a backs' game."</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old believes that despite the disappointment caused by Ireland's fall, he will benefit from the experience gained.</p>

      <p>"No matter who you are playing, even against teams which are traditionally weaker sides, it's the biggest game," reflected van der Flier. </p>
      <p>"Ourselves and Scotland in the group would have been the two traditionally bigger sides in the group but every team you play it's the biggest game of their lives.</p>
      <p>"And the same for us...well for me, anyway, playing at the World Cup. </p>
      <p>"They were the biggest games I've ever played in, but teams will come up with things you've never seen before, they play better than you've ever seen before because it's such a big deal, they've waited four years for it. And so have we.</p>
      <p>"So I learned a lot that way and then it's being around all the great players, spending time watching or playing against in a World Cup, I obviously learned bits and pieces from that as well."</p>
      <p>Van der Flier's priority isn't Ireland for now, or looking at the Six Nations. It's doing enough to stay in the pecking order for that openside role.</p>
      <p>With Dan Leavy a long term injury absentee and Sean O'Brien with London Irish, the 26-year-old is far from feeling secure in his position despite his first World Cup experience.</p>
      <p>That's because of the strong start Leinster made to the season before their World Cup players returned.</p>
      <p>"Will (Skelton), Scott Penny, they've been incredible," he said. "Watching the games, coming back from the World Cup, I was thinking over the last couple of weeks that if I don't train at my best or put in a really good performance when I can then I won't be playing.</p>
      <p>"That's because the other lads would deserve it because they've been playing so well.</p>
      <p>"Obviously they've got the club to the position we're in in the PRO14. It really pushes us on.</p>
      <p>"It was one thing that Stuart (Lancaster) and Leo (Cullen) said to me when I came back, that basically it's expected that I'd have to perform because all the back row are all playing well.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot more pressure on the position....but then, I suppose, there always is."</p>
