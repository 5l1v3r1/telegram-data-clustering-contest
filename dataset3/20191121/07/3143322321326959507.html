      <h2>It was the local (Mbombela) Big Five HOG chapter’s annual Rainbow Slowveld Bash and they hosted some 69 members from five different chapters around the country.</h2>

      <p>Have you ever marshalled a pack sporting 45-plus Harleys over a long distance? It can be quite stressful. At least, this was my assumption listening to the sighs of relief from the marshals just after the arrival of the pack at The Vine in Pilgrim’s Rest on Saturday November 9.</p>
      <p>Their HQ was the ever popular Kwanyoni Lodge, from where the group participated in various activities and open-road riding. I briefly spoke to two mystery (at the time, though) judges on their possible choices for various concourses and other awards during the weekend.</p>

      <p>All the individual Harleys that you see in this article were pointed out to me as being possible award winners. And, just between us, Oskar Rottcher favoured his own Harley for the top award – yes, he did! But being a judge… naaah – would not have been fair!</p>

      <p>At The Vine the group enjoyed one of uncle Johnny’s favourite treats – the prego roll with salad. The original Vine Restaurant was established in 1874 and it is still proving to be one of the most popular restaurants in Pilgrim’s. So Johnny, the owner, looks really good for his years – does he not?</p>
      <p>Sunday morning saw the group riding out to Silverdays Old Age Home in Waterval Boven where they surprised the well-matured inhabitants with a substantial and much needed donation.</p>
