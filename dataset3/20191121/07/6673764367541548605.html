      <p>The Financial Services Agency proposed on Wednesday realigning the Tokyo Stock Exchange into three trading markets from the current four.</p>
      <p>The proposal also sought to revamp the Topix index of all issues listed on the TSE’s first section into a new index covering fewer actively traded stocks.</p>
      <p>Topix is utilized by pension fund and investment trust fund managers as a yardstick for asset management.</p>
      <p>The proposals were presented at a meeting of a working group of the Financial System Council, an advisory panel to the prime minister.</p>
      <p>The council is expected to compile a report on the matters by the end of this year, sources familiar with the discussions said.</p>
      <p>The TSE’s four stock markets are the first and second sections, as well as the Jasdaq and Mothers markets.</p>
      <p>The FSA proposed creating a “prime” market to include actively traded stocks of companies with excellent governance, a “standard” market for stocks with relatively high liquidity and a certain market capitalization, and a “growth” market for stocks of companies with growth potential.</p>
      <p>Under the proposal, companies already listed on the TSE are expected to be allowed to decide the market where their shares would be traded.</p>
      <p>Once the council produces its report, the TSE is expected to discuss details of the reforms, including the listing criteria for the new markets, the sources said.</p>
