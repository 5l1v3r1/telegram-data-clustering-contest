      <p>After a quiet couple of years away from any film project, Deepika Padukone is all set to unleash her new offerings with Kabir Khan’s ’83’ and Meghna Gulzar’s ‘Chhapaak’. It’s also being reported that she will be seen in Shakun Batra’s dark romantic thriller, helmed by Karan Johar.</p>
      <p>However, one exciting part of this news is that Padukone will not only be acting in the film but also co-producing it. A source told <i>PinkVilla</i>, “Dippy’s film with Shakun has her playing the central character. She shoulders the film, that is a dark romantic drama, where Siddhant Chaturvedi has been paired opposite her. Karan and Deepika discussed the project and the actress really loved the idea. In fact, she also spoke to Karan and they both agreed to have her on board as a co-producer.”</p>
