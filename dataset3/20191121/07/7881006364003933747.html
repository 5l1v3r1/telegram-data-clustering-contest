      <p><b>Kolkata</b>: There was a shower of crisp currency notes from the sixth floor of a building in Kolkata's central business district on Wednesday afternoon while DRI officials were conducting a search in a private office on that floor.</p>
      <p>Bundles of currency notes of denominations of Rs 2,000, Rs 500 and Rs 100 were seen being pushed out of a window in the sixth floor with the help of a broom.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>DRI sources told news agency PTI that its officials had gone to the office of a private company engaged in export-import activities located on that floor to conduct search operations for alleged evasion of duty.</p>
