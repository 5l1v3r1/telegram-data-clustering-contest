      <p>Labour will launch its general election manifesto today with promises to take on the billionaires in order to boost wages, support the NHS and tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>Leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to make a scathing attack on ‘the establishment’ as he sets out his vision for the biggest social housing plan since the 1960s.</p>
      <p>The party’s manifesto includes a £75 billion plan to build 150,000 new council homes, as well as significant spending on the NHS and a £10-an-hour minimum wage for all workers.</p>
      <p>Labour has said its manifesto would bring about ‘real change’ to overhaul Britain’s ‘rigged’ society.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn will reveal the full details of his election manifesto in Birmingham today, but has already said it will include plans to re-nationalise utilities and provide free broadband to all homes and businesses by 2030.</p>
      <p>On Brexit, Labour will promise to renegotiate the deal agreed with the EU by Boris Johnson by March and then put that deal to a public vote within another three months – with Remain as an option.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn called the pledges a ‘manifesto of hope’ that were ‘fully costed’ – involving no tax increases for 95% of taxpayers.</p>

      <p>He issued a warning to supporters that his vision for government would be met with opposition in the remaining three weeks leading up to the 12 December polling day.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘Over the next three weeks, the most powerful people in Britain and their supporters are going to tell you that everything in this manifesto is impossible.</p>
      <p>‘That it’s too much for you. Because they don’t want real change. Why would they? The system is working just fine for them. It’s rigged in their favour.’</p>
      <p>The manifesto will contain cash intentions to boost NHS spending and tackle climate change by creating jobs in a ‘green industrial revolution’.</p>
      <p>The spree of social house building – the largest since the 1960s – will be paid for through borrowing, the party says.</p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn will be hoping his ambitious plans can turn around the party’s fortunes in the polls.</p>
      <p>The latest Savanta ComRes poll for the Telegraph gives the Conservatives an 11 point-lead over Labour.</p>
      <p>The results of the research, completed before Tuesday’s TV head-to-head leaders debate between Boris Johnson and Mr Corbyn, has the Conservatives on 42% and Labour lagging behind on 31%.</p>
      <p>The Tories have been drip-feeding policy announcements in the run-up to the party’s own manifesto launch next week.</p>
      <p>Yesterday the prime minister<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/boris-johnson-lets-slip-manifesto-pledge-cut-national-insurance-11191246/"> made a tax cut promise while out on the campaign trail,</a> vowing to lift two million low-paid workers out of making National Insurance contributions altogether by raising the threshold from £8,628 per year to £9,500.</p>

      <p>Labour criticised the headline-grabbing move – made just hours before its own manifesto launch – estimating it would only save low earners £1.64 per week.</p>

      <p>In his attack on the ‘establishment’ later today, Mr Corbyn will say: ‘Labour is on your side. And there could scarcely be a clearer demonstration of that than the furious reaction of the rich and powerful.</p>
      <p>‘If the bankers, billionaires and the establishment thought we represented politics as usual, that we could be bought off, that nothing was really going to change, they wouldn’t attack us so ferociously. Why bother?</p>
      <p>‘But they know we mean what we say. They know we will deliver our plans, which is why they want to stop us being elected.</p>
      <p>‘They know we will go after the tax dodgers, the bad bosses and the big polluters so that everybody in our country gets a fair chance in life.</p>
      <p>‘That’s why they throw everything they’ve got at us. Because they’re scared of real change. Because they aren’t on your side.’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, housing secretary Robert Jenrick is expected to reveal Tory plans to build one million extra homes over the next five years as well as measures to make it easier for renters to buy.</p>
      <p>The announcements include providing more long-term fixed-rate mortgages that require only 5% deposits, selling new-build homes to first-time buyers at a 30% discount and banning no-fault rental evictions, while allowing tenants to ‘passport’ their deposits from one property to another.</p>

      <p>Home Secretary Priti Patel is also set to announce plans for the Tories to consult on doubling the jail sentence for those found guilty of attacking police and other emergency service workers, extending their time behind bars from one year to two.</p>
      <p>The Conservatives were slammed yesterday after banning The Daily Mirror from boarding its election bus in Manchester.</p>
      <p>The left-leaning newspaper said it was the first time since the creation of touring election battle buses in the 1970s that it had been denied access to a Tory leader on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>Ian Murray, executive director at the Society of Editors, said the Mirror’s exclusion was a ‘disturbing development’.</p>
      <p>The decision follows stinging criticism of the Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ (CCHQ) for<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/twitter-threatens-tories-misleading-fake-fact-check-account-11186118/"> re-branding its Twitter account</a> to look like a fact-checking operation during the leadership debate on ITV.</p>
      <h3>Who else has released manifestos?</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/greens-launch-manifesto-100000000000-fight-climate-change-11180349/">Green Party</a> and the<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lib-dems-launch-stop-brexit-manifesto-setting-party-remain-11189629/"> Liberal Democrats</a> have already publicised their plans for government this week.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems have put stopping Brexit at the heart of their manifesto but Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said the pro-EU party was not a ‘one-trick pony’.</p>
      <p>Other incentives in the manifesto include plans to provide childcare for all pre-school children over the age of nine months.</p>
      <p>The Greens meanwhile set out plans to invest £100 billion a year in tackling climate change with a ‘Green New Deal’, intended to get Britain to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2030.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems have experienced a squeeze in the polls, with smaller parties trailing behind the top two.</p>

      <p>Ms Swinson acknowledged it would be a ‘big step’ for her to get to Number 10 following months of insisting she was a credible contender for prime minister.</p>
      <p>Sir Ed Davey, the party’s Treasury spokesman, went so far as to open the door to supporting a minority Tory administration.</p>
      <p>He told the BBC’s Andrew Neil programme that the Lib Dems could strike a deal if Mr Johnson signed-up to holding a new referendum on Europe.</p>
      <p>The senior figure said: ‘We will challenge him and we will work with others to say “if you want to do what you said, Mr Johnson (to deliver Brexit)…” if you want to do what you said, work for a “people’s vote”.’</p>
