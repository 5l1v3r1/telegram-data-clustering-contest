      <h2>Council concerned there is a rise in fly-tippers advertising their services on social media</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Jarram</a></address>
      <p>A fly-tipper who advertised his dumping business on social media has been hauled before the courts and fined more than £3,000.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Newark and Sherwood District Council</a> is now warning other rogue waste operators they will 'face the full force of the law' if they dump rubbish in the area.</p>
      <p>Corey Batterham, 24, from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/">Newark</a>, must pay more than £3,000 after pleading guilty to dumping waste at the Sherwood Pines beauty spot.</p>
      <p>Batterham failed to attend court on November 6 before being arrested by police. He attended Nottingham Magistrates' Court on November 15.</p>
      <p>Magistrates were told that Batterham had dumped polystyrene, cardboard, building materials and household rubbish on a roadway at Sherwood Pines after being paid by Jay Boby, a Newark builder, to dispose of the waste.</p>
      <p>The court heard the builder had spotted a posting on Facebook from Batterham offering waste removal. Council inspectors were able to trace the rubbish back to the original owner.</p>
      <p>Batterham was ordered to pay a £1,900 fine, £1,000 legal costs and £181 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>At the earlier hearing Boby, 27, who had failed to take the appropriate steps to prevent rubbish being fly-tipped, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/local-news/using-social-media-find-rubbish-3531777">was also was fined</a> for failing to use a licensed waste carrier.</p>
      <p>He was ordered to pay £250, reduced to £167 for an early guilty plea, with a £30 victim surcharge and £150 legal costs, totalling £347 to be paid in 14 days.</p>
      <p>The district council said it was "keenly aware" that rogue waste disposal operators - posing as legitimate businesses – are "actively advertising their services on social media sites" and often just dump collected rubbish on other people’s land or in public.</p>

      <p>Andrew Kirk, the district council’s business manager for waste management, said: "We welcome the outcome of the case as it sends out a stern warning to fly-tippers who are being targeted in the district council's Not in Newark and Sherwood campaign.</p>
      <p>"We take fly-tipping very seriously and we will seek the toughest punishments possible where the evidence supports a prosecution. Not only is fly-tipping harmful to the community and the environment, it results in a considerable cost to the public purse to clear up.</p>
      <p>"There are plenty of legitimate rubbish removal services – including the council’s own – that will dispose of your waste legally and responsibly.</p>
      <p>"However, there are some which totally ignore the law, cut corners and who will take your rubbish away with no questions asked and this simply will not be tolerated.</p>
      <p>"We will not give up pursuing fly-tippers and bringing them to justice, so it’s pleasing to see this case reach such a satisfactory conclusion."</p>
      <p>During the financial year 2018-19, the council removed 1,438 fly-tips with a combined weight of 361.89 tonnes and costing the taxpayer £55,000 annually.</p>
      <p>For the current 2019-20 period, 639 fly-tips had been removed between April and November with a combined weight of 169.59 tonnes.</p>
      <p>The council said this shows that the problem is getting worse.</p>
