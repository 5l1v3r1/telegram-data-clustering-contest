      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:34:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/margeauxsippell/" target="_blank">Margeaux Sippell</a></address>
      <p>Yorgos Lanthimos is set to direct an adaptation of “The Man in the Rockefeller Suit,” which is development at Fox Searchlight Television, a rep for the division confirmed to TheWrap. It is based on the best-selling book by Mark Seal.</p>
      <p>David Gilbert is adapting the screenplay for the limited series, which will tell the true story of Clark Rockefeller, a gregarious, successful, and mysterious descendant of the Rockefeller clan. When his wife Sandra begins to suspect that Clark isn’t who he says he is, his decades-long web of deception slowly begins to unravel.</p>
      <p>Lanthimos and Fox Searchlight worked together earlier this year on “The Favourite,” which earned 10 Oscar nominations – among them Best Picture and Best Director with Olivia Colman winning for Best Actress.</p>
