      <p>New Delhi: The Congress on Thursday slammed the government over the appointment of controversial BJP leader Pragya Thakur to a crucial consultative committee on defence and said it was "unfortunate for the country".</p>
      <p>According to a bulletin issued by the Lok Sabha Secretariat, Thakur will be part of the 21-member committee headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.</p>
      <p>"It is unfortunate for the country that an MP accused of spreading terror has been nominated as member of a defence-related committee. Modi 'has not been able to forgive her from the heart' but she has been given the responsibility of important issues such as the country's defence.</p>
      <p>"That is why if there is Modi, anything is possible," Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said in a tweet in Hindi.</p>
