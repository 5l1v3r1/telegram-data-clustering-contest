        <b>Model Slick Woods has revealed the sad news that she is battling cancer and is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who is best known for modelling Rihannaâ€™s Fenty Beauty brand, announced the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>Alongside a photo of her pulling a silly face with a group of friends and her boyfriend, Micky Munday, Slick wrote: â€˜How I feel about chemotherapy, shout out to everyone that gotta go through it.â€™</p>
      <p>But showing her sense of humour even in the most heartbreaking of situations, Slick joked with the hashtag: â€˜#atleastimalreadybald.â€™</p>
      <p>Slick, real name Simone Marie Thompson, didnâ€™t reveal what type of cancer she has in the Instagram post, but she reportedly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5HOeZyB025/">told The Shade Room</a> that she is â€˜battling stage 3 melanoma cancerâ€™ and that it is allegedly â€˜spreadingâ€™.</p>
      <p>According to the Instagram celebrity news page, Slick stated she is â€˜fighting for her lifeâ€™.</p>

      <p>Since then, sheâ€™s appeared in Vogue and modelled for the likes of Fendi, Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Moschino and Miu miu.</p>

      <p>Saphirâ€™s father is Slickâ€™s ex-boyfriend, model and singer Adonis Bosso, but they split before she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/02/slick-woods-kissed-new-man-micky-munday-split-baby-father-adonis-bosso-10101217/">struck up a romance with musician Micky Munday last year.</a></p>
