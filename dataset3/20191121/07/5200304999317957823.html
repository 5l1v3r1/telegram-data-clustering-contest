      <p>With more awareness being raised about gender equality within the film industry, Karan Johar has come out and expressed how the pay of Dharma Productions employees are based on merit not gender. </p>
      <p>“We at Dharma Productions maintain the ethos for one and all and make sure that they are paid solidly for their craft and their ability. We all are here for the same thing, and we endorse it by paying everyone working on his or her craft, be it female or male,” <i>Asian Age</i> reports the filmmaker stating. </p>
      <p>He went on to add, “When it comes to giving credit or pay parity, especially to our female leaders, we have never seen disparity from our end. They are even given a share in profit. In the future, we will see that they get production, especially when they lead and dominate the film. Pay parity is maintained, credit is given equally, and we shall make sure that this moves to the entire film fraternity as well.”</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping there are more big names who follow the same rule.</p>
