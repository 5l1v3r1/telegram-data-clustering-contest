        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 21 – Chelsea skipper Cesar Azpilicueta believes there is reason for optimism at the club under the leadership of manager Frank Lampard.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blues have defied the odds this season, and they sit third in the Premier League table after a superb response from Lampard’s men.</p>
      <p>Chelsea lost their first two matches of the campaign in all competitions, while they had to wait until the end of August for their first win.</p>
      <p>Back-to-back defeats to Valencia and Liverpool put Lampard under immense pressure, but the west London outfit have responded in fantastic fashion.</p>
      <p>They have lost just one of their last 11 matches in all competitions, and they look like qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>A top-four finish in the Premier League could also be on the cards and Azpilicueta says he never had any doubt that the squad would turn their fortunes around.</p>
      <p>Lampard has helped get the best out of Fikayo Tomori, Reece James, Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham so far this season.</p>
      <p>He has tried to keep his players grounded in recent weeks, but Azpilicueta admits he cannot help but be excited for the future.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard told GQ Magazine: “Obviously, as club captain, you have more responsibilities, but it’s a joy to watch a lot of the kids.</p>
      <p>“It has been a long path for all the kids to be in the first team, and now I think they are getting the rewards that they deserve. I think we are creating something very good and I am very pleased.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we can keep going because we are a young squad and we can keep improving. It doesn’t surprise me because I know the quality we have in the squad.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea face one of their biggest challenges of the season this weekend as they prepare to take on Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
