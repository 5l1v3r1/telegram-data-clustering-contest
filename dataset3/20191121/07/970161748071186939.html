      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! contestant <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> and her pristine visage have been causing an online stir with viewers convinced that she’s smuggled make-up into the jungle.</p>
      <p>And her Good Morning Britain presenters Susanna Reid, Ben Shepherd and Richard Arnold have continued to fan the flames about the conspiracy theory as they discussed her glamourous demeanour on today’s show.</p>
      <p>‘She looks like she’s having her hair done in there,’ Susanna commented.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Richard added: ‘She does look like she’s having a blowout, doesn’t she?’</p>
      <p>‘And a bit of make-up going on. Has she smuggled make-up in those pouches?’ Ben asked.</p>

      <p>Earlier in the week, it was revealed that Kate had brought in some concealer as her luxury item, while her fellow campmate <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jane-mcdonald-absolutely-thrilled-adele-roberts-bringing-framed-photo-im-celebrity-camp-11179207/">Adele Roberts had brought in a framed photograph of Jane McDonald</a>.</p>
      <p>As the presenters continued to debate Kate’s face, Susanna continued: ‘Well, she got that concealer, hasn’t she?’</p>

      <p>‘She had pouches put into her bikinis,’ Ben revealed. ‘Is there a bit of make-up gone in there as well?’</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity viewers have been fixed on the Kate conspiracy since the show started, with Strictly Come Dancing star Michelle Visage casting doubt on Twitter.</p>
      <p>‘How does @kategarraway have flawless hair all of the time in the jungle?’ she asked. </p>
