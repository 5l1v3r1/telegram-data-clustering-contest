        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 21 – Former Arsenal defender Martin Keown believes it would be a good move for the Gunners to consider hiring Mauricio Pochettino following his Tottenham exit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pochettino was given the boot at Spurs on Tuesday evening with Jose Mourinho coming in to replace him after a poor start to the season.</p>
      <p>And with Unai Emery under pressure with the Gunners in sixth position, Keown reckons Arsenal should think about appointing Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“There’s no need to panic at Arsenal but we are getting close to panic,” Keown told the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>“We’re not having the best of seasons. The powers that be at the top of the club should be seriously considering Pochettino.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot of admiration for what he did at Tottenham, the way he nurtured those young players and he didn’t spend a great deal of money. I don’t think Tottenham spent enough.”</p>
      <p>On Spurs’ decision to sack Pochettino, Keown added: “I would have stayed with Pochettino; I think he deserved that. I think it’s a hugely significant sacking. You’re going to have managers now looking over their shoulders.</p>
      <p>“I know the poor record he has recently, I know it all but I still would have given him another chance. I don’t like the way Tottenham have done it.</p>
      <p>“There will be a lot of chairmen looking at him now. Manchester United wanted him this time last year. I think Arsenal would have to be interested if they want to take a step forward.”</p>
