      <p>The callous killing, which was aired on television in Brazil, shows Zilda Henrique dos Santos Leandro approaching a man on Rua Barao de Amazonas in central Rio De Janeiro on Saturday, talking to him as he walks past, reportedly asking him for 1 real, which is the equivalent of 18 pence.</p>
      <p>The man continues walking away as the 31-year-old woman, who is known as Neia to locals, follows him. Later identified as Aderbal Ramos, the man stops and pulls a handgun from his waistband and shoots Henrique at least twice as she attempts to run away from him.</p>

      <p>Henrique falls in the middle of the road and Ramos simply tucks the gun back into his belt and walks away.</p>
      <p>A passerby then stops to help the woman who is lying motionless on the floor.</p>
      <p>Henrique was later rushed to Azevedo Lima State Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to Brazilian television channel <a href="https://www.redetv.uol.com.br/jornalismo/cidades/homem-mata-a-tiros-moradora-de-rua-apos-ela-pedir-r-1-no-rj-video"><i>Rede-TV</i></a>.</p>

      <p>The shocking incident took place in the early hours of Saturday morning, November 16.</p>
      <p>Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is also a former army capital, signed a decree in May which enabled a wide number of people, including truckers and politicians, to carry weapons without having to prove why they needed them.</p>

      <p>It was later watered down by lawmakers in the country, who voted in favour of only giving a limited number of people, including hunters – not millions of ordinary Brazilian residents – to buy and carry guns on the street.</p>

      <p>The new version of the bill has to approved by Brazil’s Upper House before it becomes law.</p>
      <p>Brazil already has one of the highest crime rates in the world.</p>
