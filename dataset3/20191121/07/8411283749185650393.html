      <h1>Prospects dim for Taiwan handset ODMs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:21:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:21</time> by <a rel="author">Sammi Huang, Taipei; Steve Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Prospects are dismal for Taiwan-based handset ODMs as their rivals in China, including the Wingtech Group, Huaqin Telecom Technology and Longcheer, have continued growing their prowess thanks to the rise of Chinese handset vendors in the global handset market, according to industry watchers.</p>
      <p>Among Taiwan-based handset ODMs, Arima Communications has been hit hardest due to dwindling orders from its handset clients, notably Sony Mobile Communications, said the sources.</p>
      <p>Despite efforts trying to turn around its handset business, Sony Mobile has failed to ramp up its smartphone shipments, said the sources, noting that the Japanese handset vendor shipped only about 600,000 smartphones during the July-September period of 2019, which was not meaningful for its supply chain makers, including Arima.</p>
      <p>With the exception of orders for a few ODM models to be shipped to the US, there are no orders from Sony Mobile for Arima in the second half of 2019, the sources indicated.</p>
      <p>Arima has posted operating loss of NT$386 million (US$12.648 million), and net loss of NT$67.29 million on revenues of NT$1.567 billion for the three quarters of 2019.</p>
      <p>Net loss widened to NT$68 million in October alone in which revenues totaled NT$268 million, according to company data.</p>
