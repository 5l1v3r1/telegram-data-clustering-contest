      <h1>Two teen brothers killed in city accident</h1>

      <p>Two brothers were on Wednesday morning killed in an accident at Masanafu, Rubaga Division in Kampala. They died after the car they were driving rammed into a truck.</p>
      <p>Deputy Kampala Metropolitan Police spokesperson Luke Owoyesigyire identified the victims as Shafiq Tamale and Yassin Ssali aged 19 and 17 respectively. Owoyesigyire confirmed that the victims’ vehicle Subaru with registration number plate UAU 453Q knocked a parked Isuzu Elf registration number UAZ 752T. </p>
      <p>Ismail Ssemanda, an eyewitness, said the Subaru was driving so fast and it was very difficult for the teenagers to dodge the truck. </p>
      <p>“The Subaru was so fast. They could not see this Isuzu from a distance. They hit it from behind. The vehicle overturned. They were taken to hospital but we believe they had already died from here,” Ssemanda said.</p>
      <p>Quoting eyewitnesses, Owoyesigyire said the Isuzu had allegedly developed a mechanical problem. Several accidents have happened in Kampala and its outskirts in the past few weeks leaving scores dead. Last month, Uganda People’s Defence Force (UPDF) officer Lt Col Rashid Kawawa was killed at Namugoona by a speeding taxi.</p>
      <p>Kawawa died on spot and traffic flow along the Kampala–Hoima road was paralyzed for over an hour, as police tried to record statements from eyewitnesses. Owoyesigyire said an unidentified driver hit the UPDF officer at around 8 pm and abandoned the vehicle at the accident scene.</p>
      <p>An unidentified cyclist was last week knocked dead by a truck near Kyebando–Kisalosalo Passover. The truck driver did not stop though locals said the victim Majid was riding on the pedestrian side but the truck crashed him as it attempted to dodge another vehicle.</p>
