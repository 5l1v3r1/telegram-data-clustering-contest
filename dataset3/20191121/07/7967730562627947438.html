      <p>PR queen Roxy Jacenko has told a Sydney court "tall poppy syndrome is alive and well" as she pursues an apprehended violence order against a Bitcoin entrepreneur who she claims vandalised her business.</p>
      <p>An alleged war of words between two fashion designers and businessman Anthony Hess broke out before he became embroiled in a heated confrontation with the controversial publicist at her $500-a-head speaking event at The Ivy in February.</p>

      <p>Ms Jacenko, 39, said she was in fear of Mr Hess as he came "hurtling" towards her full of "anger and aggression", but she has denied she later used him as a scapegoat after someone spray painted "Roxy is a c---" on the building of her Paddington office in April.</p>
      <p>"I’m in the public eye, yes, tall poppy syndrome is alive and well," Ms Jacenko said in response to questions about her Sweaty Betty office being previously vandalised.</p>
      <p>Ms Jacenko is seeking a protection order against Mr Hess, claiming she was verbally abused by the businessman at the event and was later the subject of malicious social media posts, as well as the graffiti attack.</p>
      <p>He denies the allegations against him.</p>

      <p>Responding to questions from her barrister, former Supreme Court judge Greg James, QC, Ms Jacenko said the spray paint attack left her feeling nervous and fearful, while the argument with Mr Hess in the ballroom of the Sydney CBD venue was intimidating.</p>
      <p>Asked how she was feeling now, she replied, "I'm shaky up here and I'm a confident person."</p>
      <p>Footage captured by a television crew at the private function was played during a hearing at the Downing Centre Local Court on Thursday. It shows Mr Hess walking through the door to the ballroom, where Ms Jacenko is waiting to go onstage.</p>
      <p>"We're leaving, that's disgusting," Mr Hess said.</p>
      <p>Ms Jacenko says: "Take a deep breath, what's the problem?" before cutting him off and telling him to "have some respect" during a brief confrontation, which ends with Mr Hess and a woman leaving down a set of stairs.</p>
      <p>The court heard Mr Hess had become upset by homophobic slurs from two female fashion designers from Melbourne, who he alleged called him a "male prostitute who had AIDS".</p>
      <p>One of the women, Bianca Roccisano, said the allegation was a "complete lie", while her sister, Bridgette, told the court, "he called me a fat bush-pig in front of everyone".</p>

      <p>Ms Jacenko said Mr Hess started "screaming and ranting" at her as she tried to enter the ballroom.</p>
      <p>"I have a room of 500 women, I don't think it's right that those women should have to be in that environment, so … my aim was to diffuse the situation and remove your client," she said to Mr Hess's lawyer, Brett Galloway.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think a man who’s double my size hurtling towards me in front of 500 women is anything but scary."</p>
      <p>Mr Galloway put to Ms Jacenko that she spoke to him "roughly" and in a condescending way.</p>
      <p>"That's your assumption," she replied.</p>
      <p>The hearing will resume at a later date.</p>
