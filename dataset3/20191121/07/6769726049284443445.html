      <p>A NEW hierarchy at South Fremantle Football Club is looking for on-field and off-field success when the club celebrates 120 years in 2020.</p>
      <p>Chief executive Cameron Britt has joined from State Basketball League team Joondalup Wolves while former Perth Demons chief executive Marty Atkins is now general manager of football and community.</p>
      <p>Atkins is a favourite son of the Bulldogs, having played a club record 266 WAFL matches.</p>
      <p>After four years with the Wolves and the Wanneroo Basketball Association, the highlight of which was the move to, and $12 million redevelopment, of HBF Arena, Britt said he felt as though his work with the SBL powerhouse was completed.</p>
      <p>“When the opportunity came up to lead a club like this, (with) a hugely successful history and great heritage, I jumped at it,” he said.</p>
      <p>“There’s some real opportunities to grow the product and bring more attendance to the game and<br/>more commercial partners into the club.”</p>
      <p>Britt said the redevelopment of Fremantle Oval was a medium to long-term goal.</p>
      <p>“We want to ensure we are within those conversations with the key agencies, political parties, potential donors and the whole consortia of groups that would be required for us to redevelop, the City of Fremantle being number one in that conversation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We want to get the club to a standard and get attendances up to signal the intent that we are ready for a redevelopment.”</p>
      <p>Atkins said women’s football and developing talent pathways for young footballers were key objectives.</p>
      <p>“At the moment we’ve only got a reserves and colts team in the WAWFL (WA Women’s Football League) but in 2021 we know we are going to have a senior team so there’s a lot of work that needs to be done around that,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Clearly we’ve got to make sure we’ve got a side that is recognised as a talented side and arguably, it’s not been our team this year but individuals that have given us some profile.</p>
      <p>“When you look at Tim Kelly, Marlion Pickett and Matty Parker, there are three great stories to come from this football club and I believe we’ve got a lot more coming.”</p>

      <p>Re-establishing a strong connection with the port district was also a priority.</p>
      <p>“Fremantle (Dockers) came in and took control of Fremantle so to speak, they’ve left and now it’s time for South Fremantle to take back Fremantle and to be recognised as the home club of this area,” Atkins said.</p>
      <p>“I had some great success at the Demons in mental health, Indigenous engagement and things like that and South Fremantle is no different.</p>
      <p>“Any opportunity for the football club to be involved in some positive experiences can only go well for us.”</p>
