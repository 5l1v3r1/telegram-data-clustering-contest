      <p>Death Stranding is incredibly haunting, with its desolate setting and fearsome dangers, but how much more haunting it would be if it were a PlayStation 1 game?</p>
      <p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35e39kBYLsw&amp;feature=emb_title">Miziziziz</a> recently shared a new short video showing how Death Stranding would look like if it were a PlayStation 1 game. The results are actually pretty good.</p>

      <p>Days after release, Death Stranding continues to be a very divisive release, with players either loving or hating, with little to no middle ground. Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-death-stranding-had-stronger-criticism-in-the-us-possibly-because-it-flies-above-shooters/">addressed the criticism</a>, saying that audiences with certain artistic sensibilities have an easier time understanding the game.</p>
      <blockquote>I must say that the game received rave reviews, especially in Europe and Japan. Here in the United States, however, we have had stronger criticisms. Perhaps it is a difficult game to understand for a certain type of critic and audience. Americans are great fans of first-person shooters and Death Stranding isn't one, it flies higher.<br/>I always try to create new things and disputes and discussions are fine, but it must be said that the Italians or the French have a different artistic sensibility that allows them to appreciate this kind of very original product, not only in video games but also in cinema.</blockquote>
      <p>Death Stranding is now available on PlayStation 4. It will be released on PC next year.</p>
