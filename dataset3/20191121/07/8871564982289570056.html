      <h1>US metal band Slipknot set to return to Singapore after 15 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:42:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Singaporean Slipknot fans, now 15 years older than they were the last time they were able to catch the U.S. nu-metal pioneers in the Little Red Dot, will soon be able to relive their youthful mosh pit days when the band makes its triumphant return on March 24. </p>
      <p>The nine-piece group — known around the world for wearing freaky masks, being identified by numbers, and calling their fans “maggots” — will perform in Singapore as part of a two-day music festival at Fort Canning Park, organizer LAMC Productions has announced. The band’s last performance in Singapore, on Aug. 16, 2005, was at the same venue. </p>
      <p>Singapore is one of the band’s Asia stops as part of their current tour to promote their sixth and latest album, <i>We Are Not Your Kind</i>.  </p>
      <p>Tickets will go on sale via the SISTIC ticketing service starting on Nov. 27. Early bird tickets are S$198, while standard tickets cost S$218. Other headliners at the festival include German rock band Scorpions, and famed ‘80s-era English hard rockers Whitesnake. </p>
      <p>Formed in 1995, Slipknot blew up during the nu-metal heyday of the late ‘90s (remember Limp Bizkit and Korn?). But Slipknot stood out thanks to their death and thrash metal influences, with popular tracks including “Psychosocial” and “Duality.” </p>
      <p>In 2005, the band won their only <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/slipknot">Grammy</a> for Best Metal Performance for “Before I Forget,” a track from the album <i>Vol 3: The Subliminal Verses</i> (2004). </p>
