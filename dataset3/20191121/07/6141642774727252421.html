      <p>The Duke of York has been forced to step down from public duties due to his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with one royal claiming it was another development in a “disastrous year” for the royal family.</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor told the PA news agency: “I would think the Queen is horrified … I think it’s been a disastrous year.”</p>
      <p>But social historian Professor Judith Rowbotham said the difficulties the royal family, including the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, had faced in 2019 were not as bad as the Queen’s annus horribilis of 1992.</p>
      <blockquote>This has been a ‘few weeks horribilis'<cite>Judith Rowbotham</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“Back in 1992, it was an annus horribilis.</p>
      <p>“This has been a ‘few weeks horribilis’,” she suggested.</p>
      <p>Here, PA looks at the controversies that have dogged the royal family in 2019.</p>
