      <p>The University of South Africa (UNISA) said on Wednesday that it had introduced additional control measures at all examination centers after reports of papers being leaked.</p>
      <p>This is the second time this year that exam leaks have affected the distance learning institute.</p>
      <p>In the latest incident, 17 modules were compromised by being leaked just before students sit for their final examinations.</p>
      <p>UNISA has, however, insisted that its assessments can still be trusted.</p>
      <p>UNISA announced that it would stop the in-house printing of exam papers in an effort to avoid leaks.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson Martin Ramotshela says they are of the firm view that the overall examination process remains reliable and intact.</p>
      <p>There were 2077 question papers being written by 298 662 students.</p>
      <p>Ramotshela said on Monday that the institution was on the trail of an individual implicated in the leaks.</p>
      <p>"The university wishes to assure all stakeholders that it takes this matter very seriously and that its investigation into the leakages, conducted jointly with the police since the May/June 2019 exam, is at an advanced stage and a breakthrough in this regard should be imminent," he said</p>
      <p>The university said it would continue to pay close attention to the examination sessions until the last day of writing to prevent any further leaks. Â </p>
      <p>Anyone with information on the leaks is urged to contact the police or toll-free Whistleblower Hotline on 0860 00 5050, or send an email to information@whistleblowing.co.za.</p>
