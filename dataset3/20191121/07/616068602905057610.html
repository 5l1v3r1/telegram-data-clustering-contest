      <p>Big fish don't like Kiss.<br/><br/>The rockers were left all at sea this week when a boat gig for sharks off the coast of Australia was a bust.<br/><br/>The promotion for Airbnb's new Animal Experiences travel program failed to attract any great whites, after experts insisted the huge creatures would swarm the boat at the sound of "low-frequency sounds of rock and roll."<br/><br/>Kiss stars Gene Simmons, Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer joined fans and reporters for the odd sea gig, which was broadcast via underwater speakers in the hope of attracting sharks.<br/><br/>Poor health forced singer and guitarist Paul Stanley to miss the event.</p>
