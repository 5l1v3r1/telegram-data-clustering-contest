      <p>North Las Vegas will explore remodeling the second floor of its municipal courthouse.</p>
      <p>The City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to let City Manager Ryann Juden negotiate a contract worth up to $115,000 for a feasibility study by the buildingâ€™s original designer, RAFI Architecture and Design.</p>
      <p>North Las Vegas spokesman Patrick Walker said the city is interested in adding more services downtown as the area develops. He said an expansion could be for court space or offices, depending on the results of the study.</p>
