      <p>The high speed, low latency and wide connectivity traits of 5G transmission technologies are expected to spur diverse applications of related terminal devices to people's daily life, particularly in the smart living segment, generating great business opportunities for IC components, power supplies, connector devices and transmission wirings.</p>
      <p>Besides home security and surveillance devices, demand for more smart sensing, response, and control solutions will increase sharply along with the 5G commercialization, significantly changing the lifestyles of people, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>The sources continued that any smart living solution will feature a core control center, mostly smart speaker or smart TV, which is used to monitor indoor lighting, air conditioning, and cleaning situations as well as electricity, water and gas consumptions.</p>
      <p>More 5G application opportunities will emerge for diverse IoT devices associated with people's surrounding living environments. And a common development trend for smart speakers, smart TVs and other smart IoT end devices is that they will get slimmer and slimmer designs.</p>
