      <h1>MCA chief accuses Salehuddin Ayub of giving out RM1.4b jobs directly</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Ayer Hitam (BN) MP Datuk Seri Wee Ka Siong claimed in Parliament today that Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister Datuk Seri Salahuddin Ayub sought to award contracts worth RM1.4 billion directly to the National Farmers Organisation (Nafas).</p>
      <p>During the Supply Bill debate, the MCA president alleged the contracts to be for rice-related subsidies and imports, adding that companies that had successfully tendered for similar jobs worth RM52.6 million have had their contracts cancelled.</p>
      <p>“He had written a letter to the prime minister on November 7 during the Tanjung Piai by-election campaign to request the direct appointment of Nafas for the agricultural imports in the paddy sector for a three year period between 2020 to 2022,” Wee claimed.</p>
      <p>According to the Opposition lawmaker, the ministry had called for an open tender on July 24 for the RM52.48 million worth of contracts over a three-year period and the companies that won the tenders have now been forced to enter into direct negotiations.</p>
      <p>Wee then warned Salehuddin to consider his answer carefully, claiming there were many firms that would come forward to expose the issue.</p>
      <p>Saying a report has been lodged with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), Wee asked if there was cronyism involved as members of Salahuddin’s Amanah party served in Nafas.</p>
      <p>“Where is the National Centre for Governance, Integrity and Anti-Corruption (GIACC) now which is supposed to champion anti-corruption, integrity and transparency?” he asked.</p>
      <p>Wee also told the Lower House that during the Tanjung Piai by-election campaign, hotel rooms were also booked under Nafas.</p>
      <p>He went on to criticise the minister for asking Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad to exempt some deals that could be construed as cronyism.</p>
      <p>Wee’s claims prompted bipartisan calls from lawmakers such as Pendang MP (PAS) Awang Hashim and Pasir Gudang MP (PH) Hassan Abdul Karim for Salehuddin to give an explanation.</p>
      <p>Later, Wee questioned PH’s integrity in governing the country, noting that the allegations he revealed today were a direct contradiction of the coalition’s claim of wanting to eliminate direct negotiations where possible.</p>
      <p>“They keep saying they champion open tenders, but when Nafas did not get it, they use the backdoor channel,” he said.</p>
      <p>The former deputy minister then asked if Dr Mahathir was misled or not given the full details in the issue.</p>
