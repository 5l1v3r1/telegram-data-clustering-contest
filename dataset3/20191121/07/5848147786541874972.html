      <h1>‘Unfit’ Andy Murray finds a way to lift in Davis Cup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:58:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/tales-azzoni/" target="_blank">Tales Azzoni</a></address>
      <p>Like he has so many times, Andy Murray has come through with a big rally to lead Britain to victory over the Netherlands in his return to the Davis Cup.</p>
      <p>Murray defeated Tallon Griekspoor 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 7-6 (7-5) on Wednesday after trailing 4-1 in the third set and 4-1 in the decisive tiebreaker, giving his team a 1-0 lead in the Group E series in the new Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>“I’ve found a way to win matches many times in my career when I’ve not been playing well,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You can draw on that a little bit. I came up with some really good defensive shots at the end of the tiebreak and found a way to win.”</p>
      <p>Murray had not played in the Davis Cup since Britain’s semi-final loss to Argentina in 2016. In October, the three-time Grand Slam champion won his first title since hip surgery in January.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t feeling in the best shape coming in and it showed a little bit in the match,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is about finding a way to win and I did that today.”</p>
      <p>Murray acknowledged he is still struggling with fitness.</p>
      <p>The Dutch evened the score 1-1 when Robin Haase beat Daniel Evans 3-6 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 in the second singles match but Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski sealed victory for Britain by defeating Wesley Koolhof and Jean-Julien Rojer in the doubles. </p>

      <p>In the revamped Davis Cup format, teams play two singles and a doubles match, with the group winners advancing to the knockout stage along with the two best second-place finishers in the six groups.</p>
      <p>The result eliminated the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Novak Djokovic cruised to a 6-1 6-2 win over 73rd-ranked Yoshihito Nishioka, giving Serbia a 2-0 victory over Japan in Group A.</p>
      <p>It was the 13th straight Davis Cup singles victory for him. He broke Nishioka’s serve three times in the first set and twice in the second at the Caja Magica.</p>
      <p>Filip Krajinovic defeated Yuichi Sugita 6-2 6-4 in the first match.</p>
      <p>The winner of Thursday’s series between Serbia and top-ranked France will guarantee a spot in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably one of the biggest challenges that we can have in this competition,” said Djokovic, who hadn’t played in the Davis Cup since 2017.</p>
      <p>“Playing against France, one of the most successful nations in Davis Cup, and definitely one of the strongest teams.”</p>
      <p>Japan have no chance of advancing after losing 2-1 to France on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Argentina routed Chile 3-0 on Tuesday but lost to Germany by the same score on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Philipp Kohlschreiber beat Guido Pella 1-6 6-3 6-4 and Jan-Lennard Struff defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-3 7-6 (8-6), then Kevin Krawietz and Andreas Mies edged Maximo Gonzalez and Leonardo Mayer in the doubles.</p>
