      <h3>Michael Owen is backing Sheffield United to secure a point against Manchester United at Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>The Red Devils will make the trip to the promoted side in pursuit of back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have won two of their last three top-flight games, easing to 3-1 victories over Norwich City and Brighton.</p>
      <p>However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side lost 1-0 to Bournemouth in their last Premier League fixture on the road.</p>
      <p>Sheffield United are in fifth position in the Premier League table and a point ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The Blades were 1-0 winners against Arsenal in front of their home supporters last month.</p>
      <p>Manchester United have managed to collect five points from their six away games in the Premier League this term.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United striker Owen is backing the Red Devils to drop more points on the road at Sheffield United on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“Sheffield United have been the surprise package of the season and Bramall Lane looks sure to be rocking for the visit of Manchester United who have picked up just five points from their six away league games this term,” Owen told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“Few would have predicted that the Blades would be looking down on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side in the table at the end of November and I believe they will maintain the one-point gap between the sides following a low-scoring draw.”</p>
      <p>Manchester United have earned a mere 16 points from their 12 games in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils will start the Premier League weekend in seventh position and nine points adrift of Manchester City in fourth spot.</p>
      <p>Manchester United haven’t won the Premier League title since 2013 when Sir Alex Ferguson was still in charge.</p>
