      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/thom-evans">Thom Evans</a> has fuelled romance rumours with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor Celebrity</a> judge <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/nicole-scherzinger">Nicole Scherzinger</a> by confessing that dating the star has "crossed his mind" following their recent flirty encounters.</p>
      <p>The contestant, 34, and the judge, 41, sparked speculation they were secretly involved after heading on a string of low-key nights out together.</p>
      <p>The rugby ace, who is a member of boy band Try Star, addressed the romance claims in an interview with <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7708817/X-Factor-EXCLUSIVE-Thom-Evans-brands-rumoured-flame-Nicole-Scherzinger-stunning-amazing.html">Mail Online</a> .</p>
      <p>The sporty hunk gushed about Nicole's "stunning" appearance and called her "talented and amazing", before revealing the truth about their relationship status.</p>

      <p>He said: "She’s stunning. And has [romance] crossed my mind? Yes. But we don't have much time."</p>
      <p>Thom insisted he has no time for romance and is focusing on getting to the final, fuelling gossip he could woo the former Pussycat Doll after the show ends.</p>
      <p>He added: "To be honest, we are focusing on the bromance and getting to the final!</p>
      <p>"We are working on choreography, vocal lessons, and it's all so full on. So there's not a lot of time for much else."</p>
      <p>Thom's cheeky remarks about Nicole come after the reality show judge and rugby ace enjoyed a secret night out together earlier in the week.</p>

      <p>An insider previously told The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10361248/nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-thom-evans/">Sun</a> : "Thom is completely Nicole's type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on — he's always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world."</p>
      <p>Recent reports have claimed the genetically-blessed duo have been texting, meeting up for drinks and flirting over the past couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>Thom and Nicole are thought to have spent last Saturday night together, partying at Tape, hours after they were romantically linked.</p>
      <p>It's said the pair have had 'great chemistry from the off'.</p>

      <p>The rugby lad is currently on the ITV show with his rugby pals Ben Foden and Levi Davis, who make up the band Try Star.</p>
      <p>Nicole even told the audience at the show's launch that she'd be up for getting to know them, laughing: "These guys are hot. I'm newly single and ready to mingle."</p>
      <p>However, just last week Thom said he was taking a vow of celibacy until The X Factor ends so he can concentrate on winning.</p>
      <p>He bragged that lots of men and women have been sliding into his DMs, but he doesn't want to meet anyone online.</p>

      <p>He insisted that he's been trying to steer clear of romance and abstain from sex throughout his Celebrity <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> experience.</p>
      <p>Shockingly, the X Factor hopeful also hinted at potential romances with his fellow singing contestants on the show, but said he is choosing not to "indulge".</p>
      <p>Nicole was previously in a long-term relationship with F1 champ Lewis Hamilton, while Thom once had a high-profile romance with Kelly Brook, which broke down after she suffered a second miscarriage.</p>
