      <h4>Wildlife authorities fear the country's last surviving Sumatran rhinoceros, named Iman, is nearing her end</h4>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2019/11/20/malaysias-last-surviving-sumatran-rhino-in-deteriorating-health/">Free Malaysia Today</a>, the 25-year-old female rhino's health is fast deteriorating despite the special care and attention by a team of experts led by veterinarian Dr Zainal Zahari Zainuddin at the Tabin Wildlife Reserve in Lahad Datu, Sabah.</p>

      <h4>Iman has tumours in her uterus</h4>
      <p>The tumours were detected when she was taken into captivity in March 2014.<br/><br/>They have since spread to her bladder and cannot be removed.ï»¿<b><br/><br/>"The vets said there is no way to halt the growth of these tumours, and surgery to remove them always was and still is too dangerous. </b>There would be inevitable major blood loss that would result in her quick demise," said Sabah Deputy Chief Minister Datuk Christina Liew in a press conference yesterday, 20 November, as quoted by <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/540393/were-losing-iman-%E2%80%93-our-last-sumatran-rhino">New Straits Times</a>.</p>

      <h4>Additionally, the female rhino has been suffering severe weight loss</h4>
      <p>This week, Iman's body weight is at 476 kilogrammes, which is 44 kilogrammes less than her average weight over the past few years.<br/><br/>She is also not eating her normal amount and is being given supplements.<br/><br/>"The situation reminds us of the case of Puntung, who was euthanised on 4 June 2017 because her squamous cell carcinoma was incurable and she was suffering," said Liew, who is also the Sabah state Tourism, Culture, and Environment Minister.</p>

      <h4>Liew said the state is now in a race against time to preserve Iman's egg cells for in-vitro fertilisation</h4>
      <p>"This is because we want to play our role to help prevent what is emerging as the first mammal species extinction of the 21st century," said Liew.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, according to <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2019/11/20/malaysias-last-sumatran-rhino-dying/1811619">Malay Mail</a>, Sabah Wildlife Department director Augustine Tuuga said they will continue to try harvesting ova from Iman, which they hope will be fertilised with an Indonesian rhino's sperm.<br/><br/>They are currently working towards formalising an agreement to collaborate with Indonesian authorities.<br/><br/>The state government had previously attempted to fertilise Iman's ovum with frozen sperm from Sabah's last male rhino <a href="https://says.com/my/news/malaysia-s-very-last-male-sumatran-rhino-has-passed-away">Kertam</a>, who died in May this year.<br/><br/>However, the attempt failed as the sperm were of poor quality.</p>
