        <b>DANIEL STENDEL has emerged as the new favourite to become the next Hearts manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 45-year-old German tops <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14918/hearts/">Jambos</a> owner Ann Budge’s wish-list after an exhaustive round of interviews.</p>

      <p>It’s understood the Tynecastle chief is finally ready to make her move, three weeks after Craig Levein’s sacking.</p>
      <p>Current caretaker boss Austin MacPhee is set to move upstairs to become the new sporting director.</p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> revealed that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4972907/felix-magath-hearts-foreigner-craig-levein/">Hearts were eyeing a foreign candidate</a>.</p>
      <p>Former Barnsley boss Stendel is that mystery man and the Jambos are prepared to spend big to get him.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He is on gardening leave following his dismissal from Oakwell last month — a sacking roundly condemned by fans.</p>
      <p>Budge has previously stated she’d be willing to pay compensation to get the right man in.</p>
      <p>A six-figure fee could be required to buy out the remaining seven months of his Tykes contract.</p>
      <p>Stendel must also now decide whether he wants to resurrect his career north of the border.</p>
      <p>The German, who grew up close to the Polish border and spoke Russian as a kid, had a successful stint as manager of Hannover before moving to Barnsley in June 2018.</p>
      <p>He was a popular figure with the club’s fans, who even threw a party for him after he left the club.</p>
      <p>Stendel is just one of several candidates the Jambos spoke with, including Stuart McCall, Neil McCann and Steve Cotterill.</p>
      <p>However, the early favourite, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14921/motherwell/">Motherwell</a> manager Stephen Robinson, has not yet been approached.</p>
      <p>MacPhee will continue in the role of interim manager for Saturday’s visit to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14919/kilmarnock/">Kilmarnock</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, defender Craig Halkett has handed the Jambos a boost by returning to training.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/362848/livingston/">Livingston</a> captain has not played since hobbling out of the 0-0 draw at <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14947/st-mirren/">St Mirren</a> on September 28 with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Saturday’s trip to Rugby Park is likely to come too soon for the 24-year-old, but the following week’s visit to Ibrox is a more likely target.</p>
      <p>Halkett joined Hearts during the summer on a three-year deal and has made 12 appearances so far this season, scoring four goals in the process.</p>
      <p>The defender’s return will be welcomed by MacPhee as Hearts’ injury list finally shows signs of easing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> striker Steven Naismith and playmaker Jamie Walker were among those who returned to first-team action before the international break.</p>
      <p>However, John Souttar, Conor Washington and Ben Garuccio all remain sidelined for now.</p>
