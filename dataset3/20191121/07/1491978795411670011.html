      <h1>Australian pacemen keep Pakistan in check on opening day of Gabba Test</h1>

        <li>Quicks tear into tourists after wicketless opening session</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins have helped clean up Pakistan for 240 after Australia’s bowlers rebounded from their toughest-ever start to a Gabba Test.</p>
      <p>Cummins finished with figures of 3-60 in his first home Test since claiming the mantle of the world’s best bowler.  Starc had 4-52 and went within a whisker of a hat-trick, before claiming the final wicket on what proved to be the final ball of the opening day.</p>
      <p>It came after Pakistan cruised to 75-0 to begin the Test summer, before Cummins kick-started a collapse of 3-4 on Thursday afternoon. With openers Azhar Ali and Shan Masood the first tourists to bat through the opening session of a Test at the Gabba without loss, Cummins turned the game with Shan’s dismissal.</p>
      <p>Just two balls after Cummins took the opener’s edge for 27, Josh Hazlewood followed suit by nicking off Azhar for 39. Hazlewood (2-46) also had Babar Azam caught in the same manner, with the Pakistan star out driving hard at a ball after making just one.</p>
      <p>Starc and Nathan Lyon (1-40) also both had wickets in the middle session, while Cummins was lucky to have Muhammad Rizwan caught behind after tea off what appeared to be a no-ball.</p>
      <p>English third umpire Michael Gough watched several replays of the Aussie quick’s foot landing on the line, before declaring it a fair delivery and Muhammad was sent on his way.</p>
      <p>Asad Shafiq and Yasir Shah then provided brief resistance for the tourists, but Starc showed again he is the world’s most dangerous bowler against tail-enders.</p>
      <p>He produced a ripper to clean up Yasir Shah via a late-inswinging yorker with the second new ball, before having Shaheen Shah Afridi caught behind next ball. The left-armer was unlucky not to claim a hat-trick, with 16-year-old debutant Naseem Shah inside edging a ball past his stumps to deny Starc.</p>
      <p>Cummins then produced a beauty in the next over to beat the resilient defence of Asad Shafiq, cutting a ball back between bat and pad. It ended a resolute 134-ball innings from the Pakistani No 4, with his 76 keeping the tourists in the battle in the last session.</p>
      <p>Pakistan are attempting to claim a first Test win in Australia since 1995, while they have never won a series in the country from 12 attempts. They have also never tasted victory at the Gabba, while Australia are unbeaten at the ground against any team in Test cricket since 1988.</p>
