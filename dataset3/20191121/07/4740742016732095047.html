      <h1>Spanish court rules Ryanair hand luggage policy is 'abusive' and orders airline to cancel it</h1>
      <h2>A passenger had to pay an additional €20 to bring 10kg of luggage on board her flight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:54:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">Elena Rodriguez, Emma Pinedo, Jessica Jones, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>A Spanish court has ruled that budget carrier <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ryanair">Ryanair's</a> policy of charging additional costs for hand luggage is "abusive" and can no longer be levied in Spain, reports the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/spanish-court-rules-ryanair-hand-20925240">Irish Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>The ruling stems from a passenger complaint made last year in which additional charges are brought against customers for bringing anything more than one personal item into the cabin.</p>
      <p>"This ruling will not affect Ryanair's baggage policy, either in the past or the future, as it is an isolated case that misinterpreted our commercial freedom to determine the size of our cabin baggage," Ryanair said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Ryanair have declined to comment whether it is planning to ignore the Spanish ruling or appeal it to the European Court of Justice.</p>
      <p>The passenger who made the complaint was travelling from Madrid to Brussels and went to court after airline staff forced her to pay €20 to bring her 10kg luggage on board.</p>

      <p>According to court documents, they ordered Ryanair to refund her the €20 plus interest, but rejected her demand for compensation of a further €10 for the suffering she experienced.</p>
      <p>The judge ruled that the hand luggage in question, by size and weight, could easily be carried in the cabin, pointing to a Spanish regulation that allows passengers to take hand luggage on board at no additional cost.</p>
      <p>The judge characterised the charge as abusive, adding that it "curtailed the rights that the passenger has recognised by law", and declared it invalid in Spain.</p>
      <p>The judge however rejected the demand for compensation, saying that while doubtless "the passenger suffered rage and powerlessness in having to pay the extra unforeseen cost at the time of boarding" the discomfort did not reach a level that would justify compensation.</p>
      <p>The court has said in a ruling that its statement can not be appealed.</p>
