      <p>A cat that looks like he has a moustache? That’s internet gold.</p>
      <p>So it’s no surprise that Charlie, a cat with markings that look like Charlie Chaplin’s iconic moustache (hence her name), is getting loads of love online.</p>
      <p>Charlie was found in a neighbour’s garden with her mother and siblings by Stacy Music, from Alabama.</p>
      <p>When the cat was three or four months old, her unusual markings started to show through, giving Stacy the idea to name her after Charlie Chaplin.</p>
      <p>Now eight years old, Charlie’s a bit of an Instagram star, racking up thousands of likes on every photo.</p>

      <p>Stacy has no plans to make Charlie a full-on celeb, mind you. The kitty is just happy living her life and relaxing at home.</p>

      <p>Stacy, a secretary, said: ‘People love seeing pictures of Charlie – I’m forever posting pictures of her on social media and she always gets a great response, with some posts generating over 5,000 likes!</p>
      <p>‘When Charlie was around three or four months old, I noticed a little moustache and thought she resembled Charlie Chaplin – which is where I got the idea for the name ‘Charlie’ from.</p>
      <p>‘Then, over the years, the moustache got a bit bigger so the name stuck.</p>

      <p>‘To us, she’s just Charlie. She’s part of the family.</p>
      <p>‘When I first found her with her mother and siblings, they were completely wild and the mum had obviously given birth beneath my neighbours van.</p>
      <p>‘The others didn’t show much interest in becoming a domesticated, but Charlie kept coming up to the house which is why we ended up taking her in.</p>
      <p>‘Her mum and siblings stayed wild, but my neighbour kept an eye on them to make sure they were doing OK.</p>

      <p>‘She’s a great cat and she loves her family very much and if anyone is too loud, she will walk in and kind of referee.</p>
      <p>‘Charlie always walks up to me when it’s bedtime and sleeps next to me.</p>

      <p>‘People tell me she looks more like the singer Freddie Mercury or actor Tom Selleck, but she has been Charlie for almost nine years, so too late to change her name now!</p>
      <p>‘People love Charlie and also comment on her moustache – a few even go as far to say she’s the cutest cat they’ve ever seen.’</p>
