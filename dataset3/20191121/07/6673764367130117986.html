      <p><b>TORONTO – </b>The underperforming Toronto Maple Leafs fired coach Mike Babcock on Wednesday and replaced him with Sheldon Keefe.</p>
      <p>Babcock had a record of 9-10-4 this season for the struggling Leafs, who are 0-5-1 in their last six games, including five straight losses in regulation.</p>
      <p>“Over parts of the last five seasons, Mike has played an integral role in changing the direction of our franchise,” team president Brendan Shanahan said in a statement. “Mike’s commitment and tireless work ethic has put our organization in a better place and we are extremely grateful and appreciative of the foundation he has helped us build here. At this time, we collectively felt that it was best to make a change to Sheldon Keefe.”</p>
      <p>Hired as part of Toronto’s massive rebuild in the spring of 2015, the 56-year-old Babcock went 173-133-45 in his four-plus seasons with Toronto. After signing the richest coaching contract in NHL history at $50 million over eight years, Babcock got Toronto to the playoffs the last three seasons but was unable to advance beyond the first round.</p>
      <p>Babcock came to Toronto with an impressive resume, having won the Stanley Cup with the Detroit Red Wings in 2008 and back-to-back Olympic gold medals with Canada in 2010 and 2014. He has a career record of 700-418-19 with Toronto, Detroit and Anaheim.</p>
      <p>Ottawa Senators coach D.J. Smith, who spent four years as an assistant on Babcock’s staff in Toronto, praised Babcock for his professionalism.</p>
      <p>“He gave me my chance in the National Hockey League,” Smith said Wednesday in Montreal before the Senators faced the Canadiens. “He showed me the NHL and he did a great job every day. It’s a tough time for him and his family and I certainly feel for him.”</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old Keefe, who has a long history with Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas, was in his fifth season as coach of the American Hockey League’s Toronto Marlies.</p>
      <p>Keefe led the Marlies to a 199-89-31 record and was twice named the AHL coach of the year. He helped the Marlies capture the franchise’s first Calder Cup championship in 2018.</p>
      <p>Babcock’s Leafs stumbled this season despite a star-studded forward group led by Auston Matthews, John Tavares, Mitch Marner and William Nylander, a defense led by Morgan Rielly, Tyson Barrie and Jake Muzzin and goalie Frederik Andersen.</p>
      <p>Despite that talent up front, Toronto was unable to find traction after a summer of change that saw a number of Babcock’s trusted veterans leave town as part of a salary-cap crunch precipitated by big-money contract extensions handed to Matthews and Marner.</p>
      <p>Toronto’s Big Four chewed up nearly half of the $81.5 million cap, leaving Dubas to try to fill in the roster around the edges with young players and discount veterans.</p>
