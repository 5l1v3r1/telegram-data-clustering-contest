      <h1>Liam Gallagher at 3Arena, Dublin: Everything you need to know</h1>
      <h2>Set list, times, tickets, restricted items and more for the singer’s two Dublin gigs</h2>

      <p>And so it looks as if the runt of the litter has sneaked up behind the top dog and bitten him on the butt. This was never supposed to happen, of course. Noel Gallagher was the primary Beatles-fixated songwriter in Oasis, his younger brother, Liam, the snarling vocalist. When the band split, the former went on to consolidate his career via his High Flying Birds outfit, while the latter formed the mediocre Beady Eye, which soon went belly-up. But the past few years has seen tables turning, with Noel treading water as Liam splashes. With two successful solo albums under his belt – 2017’s As You Were and this year’s Why Me? Why Not – and sold-out shows here and elsewhere, one has to give credit where it’s due.</p>
      <h3>Who’s the support act?</h3>
      <p>Miles Kane, the Last Shadow Puppet and one-time Rascals frontman.</p>
      <h3>When and where are the gigs?</h3>
      <p>On Saturday and Sunday evening, at <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=3Arena">3Arena</a> in Dublin.</p>
      <h3>What time should I arrive?</h3>
      <p>Doors open at 6.30pm. No official set timings have been released, but you can expect the support act to be getting under way after 7pm.</p>
      <h3>How do I get there – and home again?</h3>

There are usually extra trams on show nights because of the increased demand. The last Luas is scheduled to leave the Point at 12.30am on Saturday and 11.30pm on Sunday.</p>
