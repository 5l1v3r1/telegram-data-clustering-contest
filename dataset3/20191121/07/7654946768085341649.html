      <h1>Ex-CEO busted at JFK Airport in bribery case</h1>

      <p>The former CEO of Brazilian petrochemical company Braskem SA was arrested on U.S. corruption charges involving a slush fund used to bribe officials in Brazil, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Jose Carlos Grubisich, who was taken into custody at Kennedy Airport, pleaded not guilty in federal court in Brooklyn to violating anti-bribery and other provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and to conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>
      <p>The 62-year-old defendant was ordered held without bail after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk.</p>
      <p>An email seeking comment was sent to Grubisich’s lawyer.</p>
      <p>While the Braskem CEO from 2002 through 2008, Grubisich joined a conspiracy with an affiliated construction company called Odebrecht to divert about $250 million into a bribery slush fund, court papers said. Grubisich authorized Braskem to pay more than $16 million in bribes while seeking to build a facility in Brazil and get price breaks from a state-owned oil company, the papers say.</p>
      <p>Grubisich stepped down as CEO in 2008 but continued to have business ties with Braskem and Obedrecht, the papers say. Between 2010 and 2014, Grubisich “received at least $2.6 million from the Odebrecht bribe department into a bank account in Switzerland,” they say.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Braskem and Odebrecht agreed to pay $3.5 billion to U.S., Brazilian and Swiss authorities to settle bribery allegations.</p>
