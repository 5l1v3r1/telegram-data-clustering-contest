      <p>Wherever there is a center, there is by necessity a periphery. This in itself should not generate any headlines; we live in a world of centers, and peripheries that continually stretch those centers, whether it be politics, countries, or societal norms. It also applies to architectural practice. In a complex, interconnected world, members of the architectural profession around the world are constantly expanding into new peripheries, generating new visions for how practice should operate, influenced by technological, political, cultural, and environmental changes.</p>
      <p>With that in mind, we have compiled nine examples of networks, groups, collectives, and offices that represent different professional experiences that depart from conventional architectural practice. These examples seek to break predefined notions of what an architect is, how they work, where they work, and who they work with. Offering an architectural ethos reflective of issues like decolonization, feminism, homosexuality, and antiracism; the groups below challenge the hegemonic practices and disciplinary conventions in the architectural field through the study of the local and social complexity. The list further demonstrates how engaging in societal flows goes beyond the conventional design of a medium-size building, and intersects research, methods, experiments, participation, and diffusion of professional, regional and social edges.</p>

      <p>This non-profit entity has been operating since 2011 in Medellín in the fields of architecture, design and cultural production, seeking to propagate critical positions and actions for the problems of space and the city. The multidisciplinary work manifests through conversations, workshops, neighborhood meetings, and community gatherings, forming a network of collective spaces on a neighborhood scale. The team is made up of architects, designers, communicators, and restless citizens, constructing collaborative circuits that allow them to explore professional and spatial limits.</p>

      <p>This collective works in a transdisciplinary way to structure a “dwelling with more purpose”. The objective is to create spaces allied to its inhabitants through a participatory methodology, organized in workshops, projects and construction. The “on-demand construction” takes place with the support of future inhabitants, using drawings, physical models, digital mockups, and other expressive tools, ensuring the office proposals do not become a mere byproduct of an automatic and functionalist way of life.</p>
