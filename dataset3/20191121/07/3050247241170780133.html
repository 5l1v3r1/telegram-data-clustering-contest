      <h1>Bitcoin Miner Canaan’s IPO Nets Just $90M After Losing Banking Partner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:57:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:57</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) mining giant Canaan Creative has raised $90 million in its initial public offering (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ipo">IPO</a>) — over 75% less than expected. </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/bitcoin-mining-company-canaan-raises-90-million-in-u-s-ipo">Bloomberg</a>, which quoted filings from United States regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/sec">SEC</a>) on Nov. 20, Canaan sold 10,000,000 shares for $9 each.</p>
      <h3>From $400M to $90M</h3>
      <p>Previously, the company looked to raise considerably more. Having failed to secure an IPO in <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/hong-kong">Hong Kong</a> last year, Canaan looked to the U.S., with a funding figure of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/chinese-cryptocurrency-mining-giant-files-for-400-million-ipo-in-us">$400 million</a> circulating prior to the event.</p>
      <p>A setback came when Canaan lost its biggest bank, Credit Suisse, just last week. As a result, the size of the IPO was dramatically reduced: <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/canaan-creative-sets-terms-plans-to-rake-in-100-million-in-upcoming-us-ipo">documents submitted</a> at the time contained a projected $100 million goal and did not mention Credit Suisse.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-14/bitcoin-firm-canaan-loses-credit-suisse-as-lead-in-smaller-ipo">Bloomberg</a> citing “people familiar with the matter,” Credit Suisse “was concerned whether the offering could secure sufficient orders.”</p>
      <h3>Canaan inks first-mover advantage</h3>
      <p>The successful completion nonetheless makes Canaan the first Bitcoin mining giant to navigate an IPO, beating major competitor <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/bitmain">Bitmain</a>, which plans to do the same. </p>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-quietly-files-for-deutsche-bank-backed-ipo-in-the-us">reported</a>, a filing at the end of October revealed an IPO sponsored by embattled German lender, Deutsche Bank. At the same time, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmains-new-ipo-attempt-in-jeopardy-as-in-fighting-goes-public">infighting</a> among senior management threatens to ice the proceedings.</p>
      <p>Like Canaan, Bitmain failed to secure permission to conduct the IPO in Hong Kong in 2018. </p>
