      <h4>Manchester City host Chelsea on Saturday. Our combined XI sets up in a 4-2-3-1, with N’Golo Kante and Kevin de Bruyne an incomparable double pivot.</h4>
      <p>Chelsea have won their last five matches and will be going into this match with more confidence than they had the last time they travelled to the Etihad. There is still a debate about whether the Premier League is now a four-horse race, a two-horse race, or a one-horse milk run. This piece is not going to end that debate. Far from it: it’s here to spark more.</p>
      <h3>Goalkeeper: Ederson, Manchester City</h3>
      <p>Ederson could potentially return from his injury against Chelsea. If the Brazilian is fit, he would take the goalkeeper position for the combined XI.</p>
      <p>Kepa Arrizabalaga is often <a href="https://theprideoflondon.com/2019/11/20/chelsea-kepa-arrizabalaga-goalkeeper-competition/"><b>advertised as having good distribution</b></a>, but Ederson does it better and faster. Other than their ball-playing abilities, Ederson is also better – for the time being, anyway – at shot-stopping.</p>
      <h3>Right back: Kyle Walker, Manchester City</h3>
      <p>For what the role of a wing / full back requires, Kyle Walker has the attributes to execute that role more efficiently than either of Chelsea’s options.</p>
      <p>Cesar Azpilicueta is older and not quite as fast, and therefore would be better staying back to defend. While Azpilicueta may be the better 1v1 defender of the two, he would need to find himself in the 1v1 situation first. If his winger has already blazed past him and doesn’t give him an opportunity, he doesn’t stand a chance. In this, Walker has the advantage as Walker is one of the fastest players in the Premier League.</p>
      <h3>Center back: Kurt Zouma, Chelsea</h3>
      <p>Kurt Zouma’s form has improved incredibly since his own goal against Sheffield United. Every team needs an old-school, by-the-book, central defender to do some actual defending. Zouma’s positioning is excellent, his reading of the game is impeccable and he’s fast. Add to that the fact that he’s 6’3″, which means he can handle balls in the air as well as on the ground. Perfect.</p>
      <h3>Center back: Fikayo Tomori, Chelsea</h3>
      <p>Speaking of center back partnerships, Zouma and Tomori (Zoumori, if you will) have come to really understand each other. It would only be beneficial to any team – combined or otherwise – that they play together.</p>
      <p>What Tomori does not offer in aerial superiority he makes up for with guile and finesse. His ball-playing skills should not go unnoticed either. He’s fast and has a good reading of the game.</p>
      <h3>Left back: Marcos Alonso, Chelsea</h3>
      <p>Marcos Alonso brings to this back-line intelligence that is not common in defenders. His form has improved tremendously since he came into the Chelsea line-up this season, and he has showed why he should be in every XI.</p>
      <p>His lack of speed means he cannot quite put in the mileage that Kyle Walker would. However, he wouldn’t need to. He can just sit back and be the defensive full-back and let Walker do the running.</p>
      <p>His height and his free kick proficiency make him an asset on attacking and defending set pieces. In addition to all this, he knows how to pick his moment to get into goal-scoring positions from time to time. Many would disagree, but Alonso makes it into this combined XI.</p>
