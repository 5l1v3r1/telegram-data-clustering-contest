      <p>Would men endure a shot in the penis to prevent pregnancy? Indian researchers think so.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/first-male-birth-control-injection-almost-ready-for-penises/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPTwitter">New York Post</a> reports that the Indian Council of Medical Research, a government-funded biomedical research agency, has successfully completed a clinical trial on an injectable male contraceptive, the <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-closer-to-world-s-first-male-contraceptive-injection/story-o3lTFLnCkKHpuEDNNqrEnO.html">Hindustan Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“The product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending [from the government],” Dr R.S. Sharma, senior scientist with ICMR, told the local news outlet. “The trials are over, including extended, Phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with a 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects. The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive.”</p>
      <p>The birth control method, which lasts approximately 13 years, involves injecting a polymer, called styrene-maleic anhydride, into the vas deferens, effectively blocking sperm from leaving the testicles. The shot, preceded by a dose of local anaesthesia, is designed to supplant a traditional vasectomy.</p>
      <p>Researchers in the US have <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/04/05/new-male-contraceptive-is-injected-into-testicles-and-can-be-reversed/">developed a similar contraceptive</a>, called Vasalgel, which has not yet been <a href="https://www.parsemus.org/projects/vasalgel/">brought to market</a>. A male birth control pill also exists, though <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/25/male-birth-control-pill-has-major-breakthrough-but-still-10-years-from-market/">researchers anticipate</a> it’ll be about 10 years before the drug makes it to market. Also, drugs such as these can only prevent pregnancy and do not protect against STDs.</p>
      <p>“The polymer was developed by Professor S.K. Guha from the Indian Institute of Technology in the 1970s. ICMR has been researching on it to turn it into a product for mass use since 1984, and the final product is ready after exhaustive trials,” said Sharma. Researchers call this reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance.</p>
      <p>Drugs Controller General of India V.G. Somani said, because of pending regulatory approval, it “will still take about six to seven months … before the product can be manufactured,” they told Hindustan Times.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/pa75wg/indias-men-are-about-to-get-the-worlds-first-contraceptive-injection-but-will-they-use-it">Vice asked several Indian men</a> if they were open to the idea of a shot in the groin to prevent pregnancy. Many agreed that more options would be a boon for men and women, though many weren’t keen on needling their nether regions.</p>
      <p>When I think about this whole concept of contraception that you have to inject … it’s too graphic,” said 33-year-old Abhay. “Our [testicles] are like family jewels, so if I have to resort to using any kind of contraceptive, I’d rather go for a pill.”</p>
      <p>Shreyes, 24, liked the idea of a male contraceptive because women are “already burdened enough,” but he thinks an injection may be too much for men, adding that he’d “rather not have se_x at all” in that case.</p>
      <p>“Men are not too used to making changes in their routine, so it has to be marketed in a way that doesn’t seem so intense or difficult,” he said.</p>
