      <p><b>Parliament Winter Session Live Updates:</b> Proceedings in Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha were hit and had to be adjourned for short durations amid uproar by the Opposition over various issues.  The <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/congress/">Congress</a> has been demanding discussion over the issue of electoral bonds and government decision to disinvest in five PSUs including the <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd-stock-price/">Bharat Petroleum Corporation</a> Limited (<a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd-stock-price/">BPCL</a>).  “This is a big scam. The country is being looted. Please allow us to speak,” Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said while raising the issue of electoral bonds.</p>
      <p>Congress MP Manish Tewari said that the government overruled the <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/rbi/">RBI</a> over the issue of electoral bonds.  “I want to draw the attention of the House towards electoral bonds. The electoral bond scheme was limited to elections. RTI in 2018 revealed that government overruled Reserve <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/market/stock-market/bank-of-india-stock-price/">Bank of India</a> on electoral bonds,” he said.</p>
      <p>The hazardous air pollution in Delhi was also slated to come up for discussion in both Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha today – the fourth day of Parliament’s winter session. Discussion over the Surrogacy Bill, which aims to criminalise commercial surrogacy, is also scheduled in Rajya Sabha. The bill was passed by Lok Sabha during the monsoon session.</p>
      <p>Discussion over Delhi’s catastrophic air condition witnessed a heated debate between MPs on Tuesday and Wednesday. <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/bharatiya-janata-party/">BJP</a> MP Gautam Gambhir, who skipped a crucial Parliamentary panel meeting over the matter earlier this week, slammed the <a href="http://www.financialexpress.com/tag/aam-aadmi-party/">Aam Aadmi Party</a>-led Delhi government for its approach in tackling air pollution. Gambhir said long term solutions were needed while slamming the Delhi government for implementing Odd-Even vehicle rationing scheme.</p>
