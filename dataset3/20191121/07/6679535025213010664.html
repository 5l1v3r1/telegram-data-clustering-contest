      <p>Shares of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (BPCL), Shipping Corp of India (SCI) and Container Corp of India (Concor) showed mixed trends on November 21 after the <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/cabinet-approves-sale-of-stakes-in-bpcl-4-other-psus/article30029671.ece">Cabinet approved sale of government’s stake</a> in these companies.</p>
      <p>BPCL which opened the day 0.92% higher at ₹549.70 — its 52-week high — later erased the gains and fell to a low of ₹527.35, down 3.17% over its previous close on BSE.</p>
      <p>Shares of SCI also rose 2.12% to hit a one year high of ₹69.80 in opening trade but later pared the gains. It declined to ₹64.80, lower by 5.19% over its last close.</p>
      <p>However, Concor shares jumped 4.67% to ₹605.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In the biggest privatisation drive ever, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved sale of government’s stake in blue-chip oil firm BPCL, shipping firm SCI and cargo mover Concor as well as decided to cut shareholding in select public sector firms below 51% to boost revenue collections that have been hit by slowing economy.</p>
      <p>The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved sale of government’s entire 53.29% stake along with transfer of management control in the country’s second-biggest state-owned refiner BPCLL after taking out Numaligarh refinery from its fold, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters on November 20.</p>
      <p>It also approved the sale of an entire 63.75% government holding in SCI and a 30.8% stake in Concor.</p>
      <p>The government currently holds 54.80% in Concor and will retain 24% stake post sell-off but without any veto powers or management say, Disinvestment Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey said.</p>
