      <h1>Graham: Report on FBI's handling of Russia probe to be released Dec. 9</h1>
      <h2>Report from Justice Dept. IG Michael Horowitz</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:20:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:20</time> by <a rel="author">David Shortell and Paul LeBlanc, CNN</a></address>
      <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. - Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's report into the FBI's handling of the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/politics/russia-investigations/">Russia investigation</a> will be released December 9, Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham said.</p>
      <p>"It will be December 9th, you'll get the report," <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/fisa-report-release-date-december-9-2019-graham-says">the South Carolina Republican told Fox News.</a> "That's locked."</p>
      <p>What the report says is unknown. But<a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/11/18/politics/doj-ig-horowitz-testimony-scheduled/index.html"> some witnesses who have been interviewed</a> by the inspector general say they expect that it will likely reveal some missteps, though none that should be interpreted as undermining a legitimate investigation.</p>
      <p>The timing of the release, pronounced imminent for months, could be a boon for Republicans amid <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/20/politics/gordon-sondland-hearing-takeaways/index.html">the unfolding impeachment proceedings.</a></p>
      <p>Launched in early 2018, the inspector general investigation centered on a series of warrants the FBI filed with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court as it<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/22/politics/donald-trump-fisa-tweet/index.html"> sought to investigate Carter Page, a onetime foreign policy adviser to the 2016 Trump campaign.</a></p>
      <p>The warrants -- signed by top Justice Department officials, including former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein -- stated that the FBI believed Page "has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government," according to redacted copies the bureau released last year.</p>
      <p>To bolster their request to the surveillance court, the FBI relied at times on claims about the 2016 Trump campaign collected in a dossier of unverified intelligence reports by former British spy Christopher Steele.</p>
      <p>In recent weeks, President Donald Trump and his supporters have led a steady drumbeat of anticipation over the report, suggesting it will provide evidence of improper conduct by the FBI that undermines the credibility of the Russia investigation.</p>
      <p>Investigators from the watchdog office reviewed more than 1 million records and conducted more than 100 interviews as part of the probe, and in recent weeks the Justice Department and FBI have pored over a draft of the report to determine the classification levels of the material, Horowitz has told lawmakers.</p>
      <p>Horowitz will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee on December 11 to discuss the findings of his report.</p>
