      <p>Bigg Boss 13 is surprising its fans with amazing twists and turns on the show. It’s not just the contestants, who fight inside the house, it’s also their supporters who fight for them outside the house, on social media. As <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-after-the-physical-brawl-vindu-dara-singh-criticizes-asim-riaz-for-provocating-sidharth-shukla/5dd50b9f87fb571eff7e427a">Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz’s fight doesn’t seem to end anytime soon</a>, their fans have started #istandwithsidharthshukla and #WeStandByAsimRiaz trend on Twitter. Not even their fans, their industry friends are leaving no chance to stand by their friend, just like Karanvir Bohra.</p>
      <p>Karanvir Bohra, who was a part of last season of Bigg Boss, has taken social media to support <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-november-21-2019-spoiler-alert-sidharth-shukla-asim-riaz-screaming-will-hurt-your-ears-shefali-s-game-get-s-exposed/5dd5fa9b87fb571eff7e42eb">Sidharth Shukla during his big fight with Asim Riaz, last night. In his tweet</a>, ex-Bigg Boss contestant Karanvir Bohra wrote, “When #asim knows how his friend #sidharthshukla talks. He shouldn't have abused him in the first place and to top it all, her pushed #shukla, that is crossing the line. #istandwithsidharthshukla #biggboss13 #bb13” “There is a code between #men ... Talk loud as much as you want, but when it comes to "touching," "moving" or "shoving" all the codes are broken. The question is, who does it first? #MenWillBeMen #MensDay2019 #bb13 #BiggBoss13,” read Bhora’s another tweet. <b>(ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-is-sidharth-shukla-and-asim-riaz-bigg-fight-fake/5dd5108887fb571eff7e4281">Bigg Boss 13: Is Sidharth Shukla And Asim Riaz' BIGG Fight Fake?)</a></b></p>

      <p>When a Twitterati told reminded him of supporting Sidharth Shukla for his bad behavior inside the BB house, he re-tweeted and said, “Hey dear, I've never supported #SidharthaShukla 's bad behaviour and I've been very vocal about it... But yesterday's fight with Asim was uncalled for. If anyone would nudge and try to elbow me with a series of abuses, I wouldn't take it.”</p>
