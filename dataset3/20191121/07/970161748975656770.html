      <p>The 19-year-old, who was the latest candidate to be fired from the BBC show has previously shared with his followers that the pair were dating.</p>
      <p>Although he has now come clean and revealed that he was actually joking.</p>
      <p>Following his exit the womenswear consultant told <b>Metro.co.uk: ‘</b>We were just messing around, it was just a little joke.</p>
      <p>‘I would never ever date Lottie she is the complete opposite of what I am interested in.</p>
      <p>‘We will stay close friends though as she is in London sometimes.’</p>

      <p>It all began when a fan of The Apprentice tweeted Ryan-Mark after last Wednesday show to comment on their friendship.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: ‘Just watched last night’s episode of the apprentice, another brilliant episode. My favourites so far are<br/>@LottieLion1 @ryanmarkparsons and @ImLewisEllis.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I’ve noticed Lottie and Ryan-Mark have quite the friendship.’</p>
      <p>Ryan-Mark then added fuel to the fire by responding: ‘We’re actually dating. EXCLUSIVE.’</p>

      <p>Lottie then weighed in confirming the news as she tweeted: ‘Public Service Announcement after much speculation’</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to respond to the news – and it’s safe some people found it funny – and others were just a bit confused.</p>

      <p>Lottie, who was i<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/13/apprentice-investigates-lottie-lion-racism-accusations-told-rival-shut-ghandi-10911610/">n the centre of a ‘racism’ storm at the beginning of this Apprentice series,</a> has also been responding to fans on social media who are calling for her to go <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/the-apprentices-lottie-lion-backs-calls-to-get-her-on-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2020-11076279/">into the Australian jungle for I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here in 2020.</a></p>
      <p>And while the librarian has been retweeting the calls to ‘get her in the jungle’, she hasn’t responded as to whether she would take part or not.</p>
      <p>One questioned: ‘You like the idea then Lottie?’</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: ‘Lottie needs to be in I’m A Celeb next year’</p>
