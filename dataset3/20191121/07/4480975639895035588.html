      <p>At its November <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> meeting on Thursday, Indonesia’s central bank, Bank Indonesia (BI), left its 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 5.00%, as widely expected. The central bank stood pat after four successive rate cuts since July.</p>
      <p>The latest Reuters poll showed that 20 of 24 economists believed that Bank Indonesia (BI) will keep the key rate unchanged this week at 5.00%.</p>
      <p>The central bank Governor Warjiyo noted that global growth has the potential to improve going forward despite the US-China trade war.</p>
