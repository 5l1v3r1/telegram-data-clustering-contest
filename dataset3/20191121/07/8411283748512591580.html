      <h1>THI Consultants assesses traffic impact due to autonomous vehicles</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:55:23+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Yihan Li, Taipei; Adam Hwang, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>THI Consultants evaluates the impact on traffic conditions arising from autonomous vehicles' running on roads as reference for their trial run, according to company president Jessica Lin.</p>
      <p>The evaluation consists of three aspects: potential conflicts between autonomous vehicles and other cars, and between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians; whether autonomous vehicles running on outer lanes at low speeds interferes with traffic flows or causes traffic congestion; and decision making regarding traffic rules based on the former two aspects to minimize negative impact from autonomous vehicles.</p>
      <p>Besides, THI has approximated actual traffic conditions using in-house-developed simulation software, enabling testing of autonomous vehicles' sensing systems and training them to cope with different conditions.</p>
