      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Barron's Weekly posts a list of stocks announcing "dividend payment boosts" on the very last page of its financial data section. Here is your dog catcher 11/18/19 update.</li>
        <li>Last week, Barron's listed 27 stocks boosting dividends. The increases ranged $0.0018 per Q to $0.75 annually, and ranged 0.6% to 66.7% for this batch.</li>
        <li>Industrials with seven hikes and Financial Services with four showed the most increases last week.</li>
        <li>Ten top dividend-boosting stocks ranged from 10% to 64% in net gains calculated from broker targets plus dividends less broker fees.</li>
        <li>$5k invested in this week's lowest-priced five top-yield dividend-boostedÂ dogs showed 2.49% less net-gain than that from $5k invested in all ten. Bigger, higher-priced dividend-boosted dogs ruled this post mid-November pack.</li>
      </ul>

          <b>Foreword</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Any collection of stocks is more clearly understood when subjected to yield-based (dog catcher) analysis, these dividend-boosted batches are perfect for the Arnold dog catcher process. Here is your November 18 data from Barron's for 58 dividend paying stocks supplemented by dog catcher analysis powered by YCharts.</p>
      <p>
        <b><b>Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Analysts Estimated 9.89% To 64.4% Net Gains For Ten</b> <b>Top Dividend-Boosted Stocks To November 18, 2020</b></b>
      </p>
      <p>Four of ten top dividend-boosted stocks by yield were among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. (They are tinted gray in the chart below). Thus, this yield-based forecast for these booster dogs was graded by Wall St. Wizards as 40% accurate.</p>

      <p>Projections were based on estimated dividends from $1000 invested in each of the highest yielding stocks and their aggregate one-year analyst median target prices, as reported by YCharts.

          <b>The Dividend Dogs Rule</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, "underdogs."</p>

        <b><b>Actionable Conclusions (11-20): 10 Top</b> <b>Dividend Boosted</b> <b>Stocks By Yield</b></b>
      </p>
      <p>Top ten dividend boosted stocks reported in Barron's 11/18/19 by yield represented six of eleven Morningstar sectors plus one closed-end fund. The top of two <b>energy</b> dogs placed first, Helmrich &amp; Payne Inc. [1]. The second energy dog placed seventh, Suncor Energy Inc. [7].</p>
      <p>Then a single <b>fund</b> took second, Eagle Capital Growth (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRF">GRF</a>) [2]. Two utilities placed third and eighth, Atlantica Yield PLC (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AY">AY</a>) [3], and First Energy Corp. [8].</p>
      <p>Two <b>real estate</b> representatives placed fourth, and fifth, Retail Value Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RVI">RVI</a>) [4], and Four Corners Property Trust Inc. [5]. A single <b>industrials </b>stock placed sixth, Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico S.A.B. de C.V. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAC">PAC</a>) [6]. Then a single <b>financial services</b> sector representative placed ninth, National Bankshares, Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKSH">NKSH</a>) [9].</p>
      <p>Finally, a lone dog from the <b>basic materials</b> sector placed tenth, MDU Resources Group, Inc. (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDU">MDU</a>) [10], to complete the November 18 top ten dividend boosted list, by yield.</p>

      <p>To quantify top dog rankings, analyst mean price target estimates provide a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield metrics, analyst mean price target estimates became another tool to dig out bargains.</p>

      <p>$5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten dividend dividend booster kennel by yield were predicted by analyst 1-year targets to deliver 2.49% less gain than $5,000 invested as $.5k in all ten. The seventh lowest priced selection, Helmerich &amp; Payne Inc. was projected by broker targets to deliver the best net gains of 27.32%.</p>

      <p>The five lowest-priced top-yield dividend boosted dogs as of November 18 were: Eagle Capital Growth Fund, Atlantica Yield PLC; Four Corners Property Trust; MDU Resources Group Inc.; Suncor Energy Inc., with prices ranging from $8.21 to $31.83.</p>
      <p>Five higher-priced dividend boosted dogs as of November 18 were: Retail Value Inc.; Helmerich &amp; Payne; National Bankshares Inc.; First Energy Corp.; Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico SAB de CV, whose prices ranged from $38.36 to $107.65.</p>
      <p>The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' "basic method" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of change.</p>
      <p>The net gain/loss estimates above did not factor in any foreign or domestic tax problems resulting from distributions. Consult your tax advisor regarding the source and consequences of "dividends" from any investment.</p>
