      <h1>Claim your free Apple AirPods with selected deals on Carphone Warehouse</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/joseph-green/" target="_blank">Joseph Green</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> You can claim a free set of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b5eq">Apple AirPods</a> with a non-wireless charging case when you purchase selected iPhones on Carphone Warehouse.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Apple Airpods are just about as cool as it gets, and the street cred that comes with these little earbuds is off the scale.</p>
      <p>Of course these little devices wouldn't be so popular if it was all about the look and not about how they actually work. AirPods combine intelligent design with breakthrough technology to produce crystal clear sound. They are also powered by the new Apple H1 headphone chip, and feature hands-free access to Siri using just your voice. Sure they are stylish but they're also pretty advanced.</p>
      <p>Anyone purchasing a selected iPhone on <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b5eq">Carphone Warehouse</a> can now claim a free set of <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b5eq">Apple AirPods</a> with a non-wireless charging case. The list of selected models is pretty lengthy, so you have plenty of options when it comes to making a purchase.</p>
      <p>Apple AirPods retail for £159 with most online retailers, so it's a fairly substantial incentive that Carphone Warehouse is offering. </p>
      <p>We're surprised by the generosity, but definitely not complaining.</p>
