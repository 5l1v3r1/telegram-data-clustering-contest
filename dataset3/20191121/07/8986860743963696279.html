      <p>A few days ago, a video surfaced on social of the immediate ex-boyfriend of Ghana-based Gambian Slay Queen, known as Frederick Badji, who wept over his breakup with the pretty lady.</p>
      <p>According to Frederick Badji, who is a Senegalese young man, he will commit suicide if Princess Shyngle does not come back to him as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>As you would have it, the Princess Shyngle herself shared a video of Frederic begging and crying for a second chance claiming that he never cheated on her.</p>
      <p>The actress captioned the video saying that she is making it public because she wants to end the whole brouhaha publicly just the same way it all started.</p>
      <p>Princess Shyngle further revealed that Frederick has been sending videos, threatening to kill himself if she doesn’t allow them to come back.</p>
      <p>Princess Shyngle in reply to his threats said she doesn’t care about his suicide intention and she will not even return the ring Frederic proposed to her with.</p>
