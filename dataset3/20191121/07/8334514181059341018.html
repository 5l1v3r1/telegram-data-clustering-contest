      <p>Kawhi Leonard returned from a three-game absence caused by a knee injury to score 17 points on 7-of-20 shooting. Patrick Beverley corralled a career-best 16 rebounds to go along with 14 points and seven assists, and JaMychal Green added 10 points as Los Angeles won its third straight game.</p>
      <p>Jayson Tatum scored a season-best 30 points for Boston. Marcus Smart recorded 15 points and eight assists, Brad Wanamaker added 14 points, and Kemba Walker had 13 points and nine rebounds, shooting just 4-for-17 from the field.</p>
      <p>The contest marked the first time George and Leonard played together since both joined the Clippers in the offseason. Wednesday’s game was George’s fourth of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Mavericks 142, Warriors 94</p>
      <p>Luka Doncic scored 22 of his game-high 35 points in the first quarter as host Dallas made quick work of injury-riddled Golden State in a 48-point thrashing.</p>
      <p>Doncic ran up his 35 points in only 26 minutes, hanging around long enough to record a second straight triple-double with a game-high-tying 10 rebounds and a game-high 11 assists. According to ESPN, the 25:30 total that Doncic played was the least court time for a player in a 30-point triple-double in NBA history.</p>
      <p>Tim Hardaway Jr. went 4-for-4 from 3-point range on a 20-point night against his dad’s former team, and the Mavericks shot 22-for-38 (57.9 percent) on treys en route to their third straight win. Rookie Eric Paschall led Golden State with 22 points.</p>
      <p>Bucks 135, Hawks 127</p>
      <p>Giannis Antetokounmpo had 33 points and 11 rebounds, pacing Milwaukee to a win at Atlanta.</p>
      <p>It was the ninth time that Antetokounmpo has had 30 points and 10 rebounds in a game this season, tops in the NBA. He has accomplished the feat in eight of his past nine games. The Bucks have won five straight and nine of their past 10. Eric Bledsoe added 28 points, seven rebounds and five assists for Milwaukee.</p>
      <p>Atlanta was led by rookie De’Andre Hunter, who scored a career-high 27 points — 11 more than his previous best — and a career-best 11 rebounds. Trae Young added 25 points and eight assists, and rookie Cam Reddish scored a career-high 17 points.</p>
      <p>Wizards 138, Spurs 132</p>
      <p>Bradley Beal scored 21 of his 33 points in the third quarter as host Washington held on to beat sliding San Antonio.</p>
      <p>Beal eclipsed 30 points in four consecutive contests for the first time in his career as the Wizards sent San Antonio to its first seven-game losing skid since Gregg Popovich’s first season as Spurs coach in 1996-97.</p>
      <p>Former Spurs forward Davis Bertans and Ish Smith each added 21 points as Washington avenged a 124-122 setback to San Antonio on Oct. 26. DeMar DeRozan scored 31 points for the Spurs.</p>
      <p>Heat 124, Cavaliers 100</p>
      <p>Duncan Robinson scored a career-high 29 points — making seven 3-pointers in a decisive second quarter — as host Miami routed Cleveland.</p>
      <p>Rookie guard Tyler Herro added 22 points as the Heat improved to 6-0 at home this season. Robinson, a 6-foot-7 forward who went undrafted last year, made 9 of 15 3-point tries, falling one short of the team record of 10 3-pointers held by Mario Chalmers and Brian Shaw.</p>
      <p>Cleveland’s Kevin Love, who had missed one game due to back tightness, returned to contribute 25 points and 13 rebounds. Larry Nance Jr., who had missed two straight games due to a sprained left thumb, returned to amass 16 points and nine rebounds.</p>
      <p>Jazz 103, Timberwolves 95</p>
      <p>Bojan Bogdanovic scored 30 points — including six 3-pointers — and Donovan Mitchell added 26 to lead Utah over Minnesota in Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>Rudy Gobert had 12 points, 15 rebounds and five blocks for the Jazz. Mike Conley totaled 16 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Utah snapped a two-game losing streak and earned its third road win of the season.</p>
      <p>Andrew Wiggins finished with 22 points to lead the Wolves. Karl-Anthony Towns added 14 points and 12 rebounds. The Jazz shot 42.4 percent from 3-point range and scored 20 points off 13 Minnesota turnovers.</p>
      <p>Nets 101, Hornets 91</p>
      <p>Jarrett Allen totaled season highs of 22 points and 17 rebounds and Brooklyn defeated Charlotte in New York.</p>
      <p>The Nets won for the second time in three games without Kyrie Irving, who sat out due to right shoulder impingement. Spencer Dinwiddie started for Irving and contributed 20 points while tying a season high with eight assists.</p>
      <p>Allen enjoyed one of the most productive games of his career and recorded his fifth double-double of the season. Taurean Prince added 20 points while shooting 6-for-15 in a game the Nets never led by more than 12. Terry Rozier topped the Hornets with 18 points.</p>
      <p>Bulls 109, Pistons 89</p>
      <p>Lauri Markkanen reached the 20-point mark for the first time since the season opener with 24 points, and host Chicago ended a three-game losing streak by pounding slumping Detroit.</p>
      <p>Markkanen, who was averaging 12.3 points in nine games this month, made half of his 14 field-goal attempts and 7 of 11 free throws. Tomas Satoransky supplied 15 points and seven assists, and Shaquille Harrison had 15 points, 11 rebounds, five assists and three steals for Chicago.</p>
      <p>Former Bull Derrick Rose scored 18 points off the bench for Detroit, which has lost five straight and is 1-7 on the road. Blake Griffin scored 16 points and Luke Kennard had 14, but both shot just 4 of 15 from the field.</p>
      <p>76ers 109, Knicks 104</p>
      <p>Joel Embiid had 23 points, 12 rebounds and five assists while Ben Simmons hit the first 3-pointer of his career, and Philadelphia overturned a 17-point deficit on the way to a victory over visiting New York.</p>
      <p>Simmons hit his much-anticipated 3-pointer with 8:20 remaining in the first quarter, and the crowd exploded. Simmons had missed the first 17 treys of his career before connecting from the corner. It was his lone long-distance attempt of the night and his first 3-point try of the season.</p>
      <p>Marcus Morris scored 22 points and grabbed 13 rebounds while Julius Randle and Frank Ntilikina scored 17 points each for the Knicks. The Sixers improved to 5-0 at home and have won nine straight overall against the Knicks.</p>
      <p>Nuggets 105, Rockets 95</p>
      <p>Nikola Jokic scored a season-high 27 points and pulled down 12 rebounds, and host Denver beat Houston, ending the Rockets’ eight-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>Will Barton had 15 points and seven rebounds, and Paul Millsap scored 11 points for Denver, which had all five starters finish in double figures en route to its seventh win in eight games.</p>
      <p>James Harden had 27 points, seven rebounds and seven assists, Russell Westbrook added 25 points, and Clint Capela scored 12 points while pulling down a season-high 21 rebounds for Houston.</p>
      <p>Raptors 113, Magic 97</p>
      <p>Fred VanVleet scored 24 points and added seven assists, and Toronto defeated visiting Orlando.</p>
