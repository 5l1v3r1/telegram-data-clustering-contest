        <b>NEW Celtic hero Mo Elyounoussi has revealed that Stuart Armstrong helped him decide to join the Hoops on loan.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The irony is that it seemed Armstrong couldn’t wait to get out of Parkhead and move to the Premier League.</p>

      <p>He constantly stalled on a new <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> deal and moved to Southampton for around £7million in the summer of 2018.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/298595/scotland-football-team/">Scotland</a> star was gushing in his praise for his old club as he and Elyounoussi sat next to each other at the club’s Staplewood training base.</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi also got advice from his Norway team-mate Kris Ajer and Fraser Forster — and he’s so glad he has made the switch.</p>
      <p>Seven goals and five assists landed the Norwegian the Ladbrokes Player of the Month for October. And he said: “Stuart told me so many good things about Celtic.</p>

      <p>“I had also spoken with Kris Ajer so I had a good knowledge of what I was coming into. I didn’t look at it as a step down. I needed to get minutes on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“I feel Celtic have brought my confidence back. I am scoring goals and I’m really happy. I know the quality I have and I think the manager knows that as well.</p>
      <p>“So with his belief and trust in me and the help of the coaches too, I feel I am bringing what I can to the team.”</p>
      <p>Elyounoussi was sent home by the Norwegian national team with an injury last week. But he has revealed that it’s only a small knock on his foot.</p>
      <p>He is a doubt for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/362848/livingston/">Livingston</a> on Saturday but should be ready for Rennes in the Europa League next week.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old, who moved to Saints from Basel last year for £16million, said: “I actually picked up the injury against Hibs in the Betfred Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>“Then I had to go with the national team and it didn’t really have enough time to heal.</p>
      <p>"So we had a look at it and it was decided I needed a rest. But I think it will be all right.”</p>
      <p>Of course, Scotland could meet Norway in a winner-takes-all showdown for a place at Euro 2020, with Ajer and Elyounoussi on one side and Callum McGregor, James Forrest and Ryan Christie on the other.</p>
      <p>He added: “It would be amazing. We have already been talking about that among the boys at Celtic.</p>
      <p>"But we need to beat Serbia first in our semi-final then see what happens.”</p>
