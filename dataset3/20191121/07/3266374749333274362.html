      <h1>Transfer News: Manchester United keen on contract rebel Danny Loader</h1>

      <h3>Manchester United are reportedly interested in Reading striker Danny Loader, whose contract with the Championship club is set to end in summer 2020.</h3>
      <p>Danny Loader could be set to live every English footballer’s quintessential Premier League dream after all, if the report from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-eyeing-transfer-swoop-20913407">The Mirror</a> is to be believed. Manchester United are speculated to be interested in the teenage striker and are considering a transfer move for the Reading star.</p>
      <p>Loader came close to a Premier League transfer this summer, with Wolves almost signing the striker, only for the deal to fall through on deadline day. The Englishman stayed put and has since been in good form for the Under-23s for Reading, scoring thrice in 2 games so far.</p>
      <p>But, he hasn’t been on the right end of receiving opportunities in the senior team this season, with just 4 appearances and 101 minutes under his belt. Perhaps, a reason for it is his unwillingness to sign a new contract at Reading, with his current deal set to run out in summer 2020.</p>
      <p>His availability has sparked interest from the European bigwigs, with Manchester United and Juventus both keen on the 19-year-old.</p>

      <p>Manchester United have shown a desire to do away with their recently established transfer policy, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer revamping it to suit his profile. Now, United are back to finding gems and players that fit the system rather than bringing in big names to fit the profile of the club.</p>
      <p>We have seen Daniel James hit the ground running for Manchester United this season after coming in from Swansea City during the summer. Now, the Red Devils are eyeing other Championship starlets, with <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/19/transfer-rumour-manchester-united-keeping-tabs-on-matheus-pereira/">Matheus Pereira also linked</a>.</p>
      <p>Loader, though, is perfect for the cause as Solskjaer is short-staffed upfront, with just Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood as out-and-out striker, especially with Marcus Rashford being given the wide role.</p>
      <p>Juventus have devised a perfect transfer policy that targets soon to be out-of-contract players, both established and young with high potential. Loader is a part of the latter but could come in handy for them or provide some profit in the long run.</p>
      <p>Reading might still try and convince Loader to sign a new deal but not giving him much playing time isn’t going to help their cause.</p>
