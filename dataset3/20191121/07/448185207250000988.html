      <p><b>GUWAHATI:</b> Being deprived of their right to be treated as teacher as mentioned in Right to Education Act 2009, the Jyotikendra Siksha Karmi Santha, (JSKS) Assam demanded urgent action in solving their issues. Addressing a press conference at Guwahati Press Club on Wednesday, JSKS, Assam president Munmun Chetia complained that even after providing their selfless service in educating the children of deprived section since 2003 they are deprived from getting the benefits that they deserve.</p>
      <p>The Siksha Karmis put forward a total of three demands to the Education department. Their fist demand is to provide them the status of teacher as it is mentioned in the right to education act 2009. They also demanded for recruiting them in the posts pre-primary teachers based on their 16 years of experience. The other demand is to conduct teachers’ eligibility test for them, if it is necessary to qualify TET to be a teacher, by putting aside their 16 years of experience.</p>
      <p>JSKS general secretary Rejaul Islam said, “Even though the Siksha Karmis were put under the Right to Education Act 2009, they are not clearly provided with remuneration allotted by the act. We are being paid only Rs 6000 per month, but that too is not on clear basis.”</p>
      <p>The Santha demanded either to regularize their job and respective position or to organize a special TET. Claiming that there is no supply of books,pen and pencil, mid-day-meals and even uniform from last three year, it further showed threat to organize extreme democratic protest against the government and present the quality of products that the students of deprived section are being provided with.</p>
