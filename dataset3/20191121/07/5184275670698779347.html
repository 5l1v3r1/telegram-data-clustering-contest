      <p>Quoting the source, Bollywood Bubble has reported, “Shraddha is admittedly in love with her photographer boyfriend Rohan Shrestha. What many might have thought of as a fling – even her closest friends thought it won’t last – but it did and how. Shraddha is madly in love with Rohan and they are planning to get married sometime next year as well. Shraddha comes from a very conservative family and her parents love Rohan. They have already given their nod and want the marriage to happen sooner than ever.”</p>
      <p>The source has further said, “Shraddha will be in for a 45-day schedule for ‘Baaghi 3’ in Serbia. Tiger Shroff and she have several important scenes that need to be shot. The gruelling action schedule also begins there. To give girlfriend Shraddha company, Rohan has also taken a few days off from work and flown off to Serbia to spend some quality time with his beau. They didn’t want it to become news hence they flew off on different days to avoid the paparazzi. But now, they are happily enjoying in Serbia and when Shraddha gets break from work, she’s off to the arms of her beloved.”</p>
      <p>On the professional front, apart from <i>Baaghi 3</i>, Shraddha also has Remo D’Souza’s 3D dance film, Street dancer 3 alongside Varun Dhawan in the making.</p>
