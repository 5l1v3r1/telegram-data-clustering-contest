      <h1>Alfredo Morelos transfer latest as Saint Etienne make concession over 'greedy' Rangers</h1>
      <h2>Steven Gerrard has been adamant the Colombian will not be allowed to depart in January.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T07:41:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 07:41</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Saint-Etienne have reportedly conceded that a January transfer for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Alfredo Morelos</a> is highly unlikely.</p>
      <p>The Ligue 1 side have been linked with a winter move for the 22-goal Colombian but <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> are adamant they will not sell.</p>
      <p>Saint-Etienne are believed to have scouted the striker on several occasions this season and boss Claude Puel is keen on negotiating a deal.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steven-gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>, however, has no interest in losing his talisman with the club competing on all fronts domestically and in Europe.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/exclu-mercato-asse-le-point-sur-le-dossier-morelos-rangers-481729?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Le10sport</a> have framed this as Rangers "being greedy" by sticking to their guns over the in-form 23-year-old.</p>

      <p>They report Saint-Etienne have made little progress in their efforts to sign Morelos and that a summer approach is now more likely.</p>
      <p>Morelos' form also sparked rumours <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Aston Villa</a> were set to make a bid, with boss Dean Smith coy when asked about the frontman, admitting that he was aware of his talent but was unwilling to discuss other teams' players.</p>
      <p>However, <i><b>Record Sport </b></i>understands there is currently no interest in Morelos from the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>The striker is due to return to Ibrox from international duty, having scored his first Colombia goal against Peru in Miami.</p>
