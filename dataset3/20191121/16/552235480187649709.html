      <p>Students from West Lothian College were hosted by Creagh Concrete in Newbridge recently to learn about concrete in the construction industry.</p>
      <p>Project Manager Ryan Maxwell took time to give a tour to National Certificate Civil Engineers and Built Environment students and Foundation Apprentice Civil Engineers.</p>
      <p>Mr Maxwell also went over the diverse benefits of pre-cast concrete in the industry.</p>
      <p>Students gained insight into concrete batching, constituent materials, and the manufacture of precast concrete floor slabs, stairs and wall sections.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Lecturer Chris Wood, who joined the students on the trip, said: “The trip provided staff and students with specialist insight into precast concrete products. Our students can take this real life experience into the classroom where it will prove to be invaluable in underpinning their understanding of concrete materials and processes.</p>
      <p>“We are looking forward to building on this positive experience and cementing our new links with Creagh Concrete. Our thanks go out in particular to Ryan Maxwell and Stewart Purdie, who donated their valuable time and knowledge to us.”</p>
