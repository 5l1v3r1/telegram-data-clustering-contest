      <p>Apostle Johnson Suleman of the Omega Fire Ministries (OFM) is set to launch a “mobile network” in the United Kingdom (UK), Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>This news medium understands that Apostle Suleman announced this in a tweet on his handle on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Apostle Suleman did not, however, provide details about the project as he called on his followers to pray for him.</p>
      <p>“Pray along with us as we launch our mobile network in [the] United Kingdom…coming soon,” he tweeted.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, Apostle Suleman had said he wants to launch an airline, adding that he dreams of employing 3,000 Africans through it.</p>
      <p>According to him, 50 per cent of the airline’s staff would be Nigerians as “part of our contribution to nation-building.”</p>
