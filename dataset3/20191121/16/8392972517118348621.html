      <p>Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson went on a potentially dangerous fasting diet in the run-up to this year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>The buff <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor</a> winner, 28, told fans on Instagram he was undergoing "water fasting" and said he felt it gave him "more energy and life".</p>
      <p>But he cautioned his followers by warning that the controversial method "isn't for everybody" and should be taken "very seriously" if attempted.</p>

      <p>He shared a topless snap of himself lounging in his bed and wrote in the caption: "Morning gang. 40 hours of fasting done so far."</p>
      <p>"@nicooholi put me onto it and strangely I have more energy and life when I am water fasting. Cleanses my body and soul! Have a good day and go get it.</p>
      <p>"PS, water fasting isn't for everybody and if done, should be taken very seriously and with caution! #WaterFasting #Fasting #Morning #Energy #Water."</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319835.php">MedicalNewsToday</a>, water fasting is when a person eats no food for a certain period and instead only drinks water.</p>
      <p>The website explained: "People may undertake water fasting to lose weight, for spiritual or religious reasons, or to try and combat particular health problems.</p>
      <aside>Strangely I have more energy and life when I am water fasting.</aside>
      <p>"Research suggests that occasional fasting may help with weight loss, although other methods may be more effective long-term."</p>
      <p>However he achieved it, Myles is looking in great shape on I'm A Celeb.</p>

      <p>Wednesday's episode saw the singer join forces with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-viewers-complain-about-kate-garraways-bunches/">Kate Garraway</a> to win a few treats for the camp.</p>
      <p>The pair had to dress like pigeons and use long sticks to place eggs into a wooden bird house.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The task required an incredible level of balance but they managed to get enough in for a visit to Kiosk Kev.</p>
      <p>They chose chocolate eggs as the prize and Kiosk Kev called through to the camp, asking them what percentage of the public considered social media to have a negative impact on society - 46% or 66%.</p>
      <p>But their campmates ended up answering incorrectly, leaving Myles and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebritys-kate-garraway-on-forcing-herself-to-have-sex-with-husband-every-day/">Good Morning Britain star Kate</a> gutted as they made their way back empty handed.</p>
