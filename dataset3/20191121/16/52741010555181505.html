      <p>ASHVILLE, N.C. — North Carolina’s famed Cold Mountain is on fire.</p>
      <p>The Raleigh News &amp; Observer reported Thursday at a U.S. Forest Service video shows orange flames and white smoke along multiple spots on the mountain’s ridge.</p>
      <p>The mountain has been featured in a popular novel and an award-winning movie. Charles Frazier’s bestselling book “Cold Mountain” is about a Confederate soldier’s journey through western North Carolina. The book was later adapted into a 2003 movie starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger.</p>
      <p>The forest service didn’t release details on what might have caused the fire or where it started. The Shining Rock Wilderness area is temporarily closed because of the fire.</p>
      <p>The mountain is about 35 miles (56 kilometres) from the city of Ashville.</p>
