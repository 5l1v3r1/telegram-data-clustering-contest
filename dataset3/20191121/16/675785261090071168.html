      <p>A heavily pregnant woman was caught on camera being viciously punched at a cafe after a man allegedly made a racist comment.</p>
      <p>The woman, 31, and two of her friends, were chatting at a table outside the Bay Vista restaurant in Parramatta, New South Wales, when a man approached to them and exchanged a brief conversation.</p>
      <p>The mum-to-be, who is at 38 weeks pregnant, said he made racist comment before the assault.</p>
      <p>CCTV footage on Tuesday shows the man leaning over the table before lashing out strong punches towards the woman, who is seen wearing a hijab.</p>

      <p>Her relative wrote on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> : "My poor cousin's wife was attacked at Bay Vista last night.</p>
      <p>"This was a racial attack. May Allah heal you from this traumatic experience."</p>
      <p>Parramatta Police arrested 43-year-old Stipe Lozina.</p>
      <p>He appeared at Parramatta Local Court on Thursday charged with affray and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Tim Keady said: "After making a comment about Muslims, you approached her and punched her to the head 14 times.</p>
      <p>"The matters described here as violent, irrational and it is influenced as a mental health problem."</p>

      <p>Parramatta police Inspector Lucas Sywenkyj said the vile attack left the woman visibly shaken.</p>
      <p>He refused bail and will remain behind bars until at least next month.</p>
      <p>He said: "As a result of the assault does seem emotionally and physically traumatised.</p>
      <p>"Our police investigation is still in its infancy but it would appear to be completely random and unprovoked."</p>
