      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Focus Features is giving a first glimpse of Anya Taylor-Joy in<i> Emma</i>.</p>
      <p>The studio released a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsOwj0PR5Sk"> teaser trailer</a> for the film Thursday featuring Taylor-Joy, 23, as the titular character, Emma Woodhouse.</p>
      <p>Johnny Flynn co-stars as George Knightley, with <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bill_Nighy/?tps=1">Bill Nighy</a> as Mr. Woodhouse, Miranda Hart as Miss Bates, Mia Goth as Harriet Smith, Josh O'Connor as Mr. Elton and Callum Turner as Frank Churchill.</p>
      <p><i>Emma</i> is based on the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jane_Austen/?tps=1">Jane Austen</a> novel of the same name, which was previously adapted as a 1996 film starring <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Gwyneth_Paltrow/?tps=1">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>. The movie follows Emma (Taylor-Joy), a "handsome, clever, and rich" young woman who attempts to play matchmaker.</p>
      <p>Taylor-Joy is known for her roles in dark films, such as <i>The Witch</i>, <i>Split </i>and <i>Thoroughbreds</i>. She said in an interview <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2018/09/the-miniaturist-anya-taylor-joy-pbs-1202004033/">with IndieWire</a> in September that she is drawn to characters, rather than genres or tones.</p>
      <p>"It's a weird sort of magic feeling when I read a script and I hear the character's voice," the actress said. "If I hear her voice instantly and I already start sitting like the person, I'm just like, 'Okay, this person belongs to me, and I belong to them.'"</p>
      <p><i>Emma</i> is directed by Autumn de Wilde and opens in theaters Feb. 21.</p>
