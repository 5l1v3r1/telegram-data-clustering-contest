      <h1>Damarious Randall Says He Got Numerous Death Threats After Helmet-To-Helmet Hit, Ejection (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:24:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:24</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Lost in the massive ugly fight between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers was a nasty helmet-to-helmet Browns safety Damarious Randall delivered to Steelers receiver Diontae Johnson that got Randall ejected from last week’s game.</p>
      <p>That hit left Johnson bleeding from his ear and with a concussion. Randall stated it wasn’t intentional, but he still received numerous death threats because of that hit.</p>
      <p>“How is it, from the standpoint, after the hit . . . I get so many death threats, so many people calling me names, people saying, ‘Oh, I hope you get hurt; I’m going to kill you, this and that,’” Randall told Mary Kay Cabot of <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2019/11/browns-damarious-randall-laments-so-many-death-threats-on-his-social-media-after-getting-ejected-from-steelers-game.html">cleveland.com</a>, “and it’s OK for fans to do it to us, but then when we say something back, it’s a problem, [and] we get in trouble? I just never understood that.”</p>

      <p>“It’s just funny to me how they blurt out and just say crazy, off the wall stuff, but just like the situation with one of my former teammates [safety Jermaine Whitehead],” Randall said. “He lost his job behind something like that, but it’s OK for them to openly say stuff like that. I find that so crazy to me.”</p>
      <p>The Steelers and Browns face each other one more time in December and emotions will be on high all game long, especially if both teams are still in the playoff race.</p>
