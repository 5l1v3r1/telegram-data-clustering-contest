      <h1>After Trauma , a Silenced Vocalist Sings Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:18:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim</a></address>
      <p>In the fall of 2013, the vocalist Lucy Dhegrae performed a solo called “Dithyramb.” The five-minute piece, written by Jason Eckardt, consists of cries, truncated syllables and sharp sibilant sounds that appear to resemble someone angrily shushing herself.</p>
      <p>At the end, Ms. Dhegrae forced a single breath into a painfully long note that turned into a stifled hiss, held until her face changed color and her eyes teared up. From the audience, it looked like self-asphyxiation.</p>
      <p>“It’s supposed to be a prayer to Dionysus, the god of ecstasy,” Ms. Dhegrae said of the piece in a recent interview. “And the entire time I thought about what had happened and how I had not talked about it — and would it ever go away.”</p>

      <p>As a freshman at the University of Michigan, Ms. Dhegrae had been drugged and raped. She had kept silent about it, and as she sang “Dithyramb,” the 10-year statute of limitations was about to expire.</p>
      <p>The trauma of her assault is the subject of Ms. Dhegrae’s four-concert Processing Series, <a href="https://nationalsawdust.org/event/lucy-dhegrae/">which opens on Saturday at National Sawdust</a> in Brooklyn. The series attempts to shed light on the complex relationship between mind and body. At the core of each concert is a new work written for Ms. Dhegrae that is intended to be both about healing and actively therapeutic for the performer.</p>
      <p>Therapeutic both mentally and physically: Soon after that 2013 performance of “Dithyramb,” Ms. Dhegrae, the founder of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/arts/music/review-resonant-bodies-festival.html?module=inline">the Resonant Bodies Festival of contemporary vocal music</a>, found she could no longer sing. Doctors diagnosed her with paresis of the vocal folds, a muscular dysfunction. When her voice teacher heard about it, she advised Ms. Dhegrae against letting anyone know, arguing that even to mention such a condition could endanger her career.</p>
      <p>“It was like going through the rape again,” said Ms. Dhegrae. “It was that same sense of: ‘Hide this thing that happened to you. Don’t talk to anyone about it.’ You are dealing with this huge personal crisis but feeling shamed about it and completely alone.”</p>
      <p>The body of work she has commissioned for the Processing Series is designed to reflect the multiplicity of approaches that helped her. These include meditation and breathwork, internal family systems (I.F.S.) therapy, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (E.M.D.R.), and self-defense training.</p>
      <p>The most important step in healing was speaking out. After she was diagnosed with paresis, Ms. Dhegrae threw herself into research, spending up to 20 hours a day trawling through scientific journals and poring over her own medical history. Her doctors never investigated a possible psychosomatic cause.</p>
      <p>But two scientific articles struck a chord. They dealt with victims of sexual assault who had developed vocal disorders but regained their voices once they spoke out about their experience.</p>
      <p>“I had that deep sense that this is me,” Ms. Dhegrae said. “I thought, if the way to get back my voice is to talk about it — whatever it takes, I will do it.”</p>
      <p>She contacted the speakers bureau of RAINN, the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, and began telling her story at schools and colleges. (Her condition affected her singing, but not her speaking voice.) She did report her rape to an investigator from the University of Michigan’s campus police, but the statute of limitations had expired, and the man denied the charges.</p>
      <p>But in Neil Semer, Ms. Dhegrae finally found a singing teacher who understood the connection between psychological states and the voice. “Singing is about body alignment and openness,” he said in a phone interview. “When trauma is embedded in the body, standing up unapologetically and being direct in one’s expression is often compromised.”</p>
      <p>Helping Ms. Dhegrae regain her voice became “a process of empowerment,” he said. He encouraged her to take up Krav Maga, a self-defense system developed in the Israeli military. During their lessons, he had her forcefully utter the word “no” over and over.</p>
      <p>That exercise turned into “No,” a work by Caleb Burhans which will be part of the program at National Sawdust on Saturday. It layers recordings of Ms. Dhegrae intoning the word until the flurry of “no” comes together in a sonic tapestry that is stable and calm.</p>
      <p>The program also includes Osnat Netzer’s “Philomelos,” inspired by Lavinia from Shakespeare’s “Titus Andronicus,” who, even with her tongue and hands cut off, finds a way to identify her rapist. A violinist and a percussionist stand in for the different personality components that interact with each other in I.F.S. therapy.</p>
      <p>Other composers Ms. Dhegrae commissioned also found musical expressions for specific forms of therapy. Katherine Young produced a piece that includes a humming meditation, and an electronic score that plays with the left and right channels of a sound system, to evoke the buzzers held in each hand by a patient undergoing E.M.D.R.</p>
      <p>Eve Beglarian took a different approach. Her response to the commission at first unsettled Ms. Dhegrae. When she received it, she said, “It ripped my heart out.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Beglarian drew on her own experience of having been, as she put it in an interview, “messed with” by a much older man when she was 11. Her recovery involved flexing her sexual power with men in order to “transform the very thing that made me feel vulnerable into a strength.”</p>
      <p>Her work for Ms. Dhegrae draws on pornography and Balthus’s erotically charged painting “Thérèse Dreaming,” leading the female performer through a process of sexual emancipation from male control. “It was a big ask,” Ms. Beglarian said of the work’s emotional demands.</p>
      <p>Toward the end, the piece references the judge’s words at the trial of Lawrence G. Nassar, the former doctor for the national gymnastics team and Michigan State University who was convicted of sexually assaulting numerous young women. Addressing one survivor, the judge said, “Leave your pain here and go out and do your magnificent thing.”</p>
      <p>The title of the program, in January, that will feature Ms. Beglarian’s piece draws on a letter by Rilke in which he writes of “a barely arching bridge that connects the terrible to the tender.” It speaks to Ms. Dhegrae’s attempt to turn trauma into music.</p>
      <p>“As artists, we’re only bestowed a few deeply personally meaningful works to perform,” Ms. Dhegrae said. “For a long time I cut off my body from my mind. But singing is a full confrontation of all the parts of your body and your mind that you have not listened to.”</p>
