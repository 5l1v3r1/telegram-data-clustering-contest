      <h3>Best Overall: SteelSeries Arctis 7</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/06/steelseries-arctis-7-lifestyle.jpg?itok=UR3Adi3O"/>

      <p>Let's be honest, gaming headsets tend to be gaudy. You've seen the unwieldy ones that light up in every color imaginable and look like they can be used as bludgeoning weapons. That's not to say they aren't good headphones, but they certainly aren't the most stylish. The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/steelseries-arctis-7-review">SteelSeries Arctis 7</a> benefits from its sleek design. You won't be embarrassed to wear this one no matter the occasion, and its style only scratches the surface of its favorable features.</p>
      <p>Headsets are more than just about looks, though. The Arctis 7 features what is widely regarded as one of the best microphones in the business, and its 7.1 surround sound audio is second to none—but only available when using it on PC. Should you want to finely adjust it, SteelSeries also offers customization software so that you can get the most out of your Arctis 7.</p>
      <p>And you won't need to worry about charging it often either. This headset provides up to 24 hours of gaming on a single charge thanks to its rechargeable Li-ion battery, and it's fairly comfortable to wear for long periods of time. You'll find most other headsets tend to provide anywhere between 10 and 20 hours.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Stylish</li>
        <li>Affordable</li>
        <li>Great audio quality</li>
        <li>24-hour battery life</li>
        <li>ClearCast retractable microphone</li>
        <li>Customization software</li>
        <li>Additional 3.5mm cable included</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>7.1 surround sound only on PC</li>
        <li>Adjustable ChatMix for PC only</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Overall</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>Affordable, stylish, and impeccable audio</p>
      <p>There's not a lot wrong with the SteelSeries Arctis 7. It takes the best features and an attractive form factor and bundles it into an affordable package.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Lossless-Wireless-Headset-Headphone/dp/B07FZVXS8H/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU76271YYw">$113 from Amazon</a>

      <h3>Runner-up: HyperX Cloud Flight</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large/public/article_images/2019/06/hyperx-cloud-flight-lifestyle.jpg?itok=4VJ_X1OP"/>

      </figure>
      <p>When you're looking for comfort and quality at an affordable price, you'll want to consider the HyperX Cloud Flight. It may not be as great all-around as the SteelSeries Arctis 7, but it gives the latter pair of headsets a run for its money. The HyperX Cloud Flight sports a detachable microphone, 90-degree rotating ear cups, and an adjustable steel slider for durability.</p>
      <p>HyperX Cloud Flight by far provides the longest battery life on a single charge—boasting up to 30 hours—but there is a caveat. This number is assuming that you don't use its LED lighting. If you turn the LEDs completely on, it cuts the battery life to just 13 hours. When the LEDs are on with its breathing effect, you can get roughly 18 hours.</p>
      <p>Its biggest downside is that it only offers stereo audio as opposed to 7.1 surround sound. While its audio quality may not be as impressive as a result, it's still good nonetheless.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Up to 30-hour battery life</li>
        <li>Rotating ear cups</li>
        <li>Detachable microphone</li>
        <li>Additional 3.5mm cable included</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>No 7.1 surround sound</li>
        <li>LED mode cuts battery life to 13 hours</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Runner-up</h4>

      <h3>Best value: Turtle Beach Stealth 600</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_brb/public/article_images/2019/06/turtle-beach-stealth-600-lifestyle.jpg?itok=7V-Re6uU"/>
        <figcaption>

      </figure>
      <p>Turtle Beach is usually a brand name you can't beat for its price. The company's Stealth 600 is perfect for those wanting a budget-friendly quality headset without breaking the bank. Wireless headsets tend to err on the expensive side, but the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 is incredibly affordable at just $100.</p>
      <p>Its microphone is flip-to-mute, meaning you won't need to worry about pressing the wrong button on your headset when you want to mute yourself. And its mic monitoring allows you to hear your own voice through the headset and adjust the volume accordingly. Turtle Beach's "Superhuman Hearing" technology that emphasizes subtle in-game sounds is also present.</p>
      <p>Though the Stealth 600 advertises "surround sound," it's only Turtle Beach's own virtual surround sound and not Dolby 7.1. Because of this, the audio quality tends to suffer, but it's still better than stereo most of the time. And the battery life is acceptable at 15-hours, even if it's only half of what the SteelSeries Arctis 7 offers.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Affordable</li>
        <li>Glasses-friendly design</li>
        <li>Flip-up to mute mic</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Audio is just decent</li>
        <li>15-hour battery life</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Value</h4>

      </h4>
      <p>Budget-friendly for a brand name</p>
      <p>When it comes to wireless headsets, you can't beat the price of the Turtle Beach Stealth 600. And it's a brand name that you can trust where headsets are concerned.</p>

      <h3>Best Premium: Astro A50</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_blw/public/article_images/2019/06/astro-a50-lifestyle.jpg?itok=35q7o1hg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The Astro A50 provides crystal-clear Dolby 7.1 surround sound over a 5GHz wireless connection. It's hard to beat that when you're looking for the best audio experience possible. It even comes with its own charging station so you can easily display it on your desk.</p>
      <p>Those looking for comfort will find it more than adequate in that regard with breathable fabric ear cups. A mod kit is available to purchase separately that allows you to swap out its parts for a synthetic leather headband and ear cups, improving its noise-canceling abilities. The downside to all of this is that no matter what you swap out the parts with, the Astro A50 still tends to be bulky and gaudy.</p>
      <p>This beast is easily the best premium headset you can get for PlayStation 4, and it comes at a steep price because of that. You're going to be looking at spending a good chunk of change on the Astro A50. It packs some premium features to warrant the expensive price tag.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Dolby 7.1 surround sound</li>
        <li>5GHz wireless connection</li>
        <li>Flip-to-mute mic</li>
        <li>Base station included</li>

      <h4>Cons:</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Razer makes some of the best headsets in the business, and it outdid itself with the Razer Thresher Ultimate for PlayStation 4. You're getting impeccable Dolby 7.1 surround sound with wireless connectivity up to 40 feet, so you don't need to worry about missing any of the conversation with your friends if you need to leave the room.</p>
      <p>Its microphone is retractable so you can move it out of the way, and when you're not using the headset you can place it on its base station — that can be used to switch effortlessly between PS4 and PC — which is included. You can get up to 16-hours without needing to charge the Razer Thresher Ultimate. Its memory foam ear cups make this as comfortable as possible to make up for its heavy weight of 408g.</p>
      <p>Again, this is another expensive one.There are cheaper Razer Thresher models out there, but the Ultimate is the best package out of the batch if you're looking for the most features.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Dolby 7.1 surround sound</li>
        <li>Connectivity up to 40ft</li>
        <li>Retractable microphone</li>
        <li>Base station included</li>

      <h3>Multi-source Audio: Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.androidcentral.com/sites/androidcentral.com/files/styles/large_wm_blb/public/article_images/2019/06/logitech-g933-artemis-spectrum-lifestyle.jpg?itok=sRHCxoKH"/>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>It's immediately apparent that this headset screams "gamer." You'll be hard-pressed to find one with a more gaudy design, but what it lacks in style it makes up for in audio delivery. This is another one that packs 7.1 surround sound with spatial awareness so that you're never missing any of the action in-game.</p>
      <p>Being multi-platform compatible, you aren't even restricted to using it on just PlayStation 4 or PC. The Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum is compatible with Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and mobile as well. Its multiple source audio mixing support means that you can plug in up to three devices (one USB, two analog) to answer calls and play music. The programmable G-keys on the ear cup can be used to set custom controls for gaming and media.</p>
      <p>It sports the lowest battery life at just 8-12 hours depending on whether you're using its RGB lighting or not, and it's not too budget-friendly, so this one's features outside of gaming will likely be the deciding factor in your purchase.</p>
      <h4>Pros:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>7.1 surround sound</li>
        <li>Multi-platform compatibility</li>
        <li>Customization software</li>
        <li>Multiple source audio mixing</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Cons:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Gaudy design</li>
        <li>Only 8-12 hours of battery life</li>
        <li>Expensive</li>

      </h4>
      <p>For all of your audio needs</p>
      <p>Another gaudy headset with a low battery life, but the Logitech G933 Artemis Spectrum is good for just about anything thanks to its multiple source audio mixing support and 7.1 surround sound.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Bottom line</h3>
      <p>The best wireless headset all-around is easily the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Lossless-Wireless-Headset-Headphone/dp/B07FZVXS8H/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU76271YYw">SteelSeries Arctis 7</a>. It's quite affordable, stylish, and provides a wonderful audio experience whether you're concerned with its microphone or headset itself. On top of that, it has one of the best battery lives out there and comes with customization software to make it even better.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for something a little more premium, you can't beat the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASTRO-Gaming-A50-Wireless-Dolby-Headset/dp/B01G3WBIJ0/?th=1&amp;tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU76271YYw">Astro A50</a>. Questionable-looking design aside, its 7.1 surround sound is crystal clear. Just be prepared for its higher price tag because of this. Wireless headsets don't come cheap, and though you aren't always paying for quality, it's a good indicator in this regard that you're getting a top-of-the-line product.</p>
      <p>While the absolute best quality audio is found on a <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wired-vs-wireless-which-ps4-headset-right-for-you">good wired headset</a>, not everyone wants to deal with all of the cables that come with them. Wired might still be the best, but wireless can still provide an excellent audio experience, and you can't go wrong with any of the above wireless headsets.</p>
      <h3>How to find the best Black Friday deals on wireless PS4 headsets</h3>
      <p>When it comes to headsets, audio quality and comfort should be paramount. When shopping on Black Friday, be sure to check reviews and see what people have to say about a particular headset. A steep discount won't do you any good if you come to find out that headset you just bought isn't so comfortable when you're wearing glasses. For anyone looking to get into game streaming but who doesn't want to buy a separate microphone, try to get one that either retracts or that flips up to mute. Also, always try to find a pair with good battery life. Wireless means nothing if you constantly have to charge it.</p>
      <p>Any brand that sells gaming accessories will likely have good deals on wireless headsets this Black Friday. It's rare to find a wireless headset bundled with a console or a few games, so you should look at grabbing a headset on its own. Remember that just because a headset may normally sell for $300, that doesn't mean it's the best out there. Plenty of wireless headsets get the job done for a fraction of that price.</p>
      <p>We'll keep you updated on exact discounts for these headsets as we see them. For deals on other tech and accessories, be sure to check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/black-friday-cyber-monday-2019">Black Friday shopping guides</a> here on Android Central.</p>
