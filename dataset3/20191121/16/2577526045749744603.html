      <h1>Square Enix Kicks Off Awareness Campaign with UK Youth Homelessness Charity Centrepoint</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:34:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Square Enix has announced a partnership with UK youth homelessness charity Centrepoint in an attempt to raise awareness among Life is Strange players about the difficulties faced by young homeless people at this time of year.</p>
      <p><i>Life is Strange 2</i> focuses on Sean and Daniel Diaz, two brothers who find themselves homeless during the first episode of the game. In a press release, Jon Brooke, co-studio head at Square Enix External Studios, said that “Life is Strange fans are passionate about the themes they encounter in the game,” and that the partnership with Centrepoint aims “to provide a way for them to get involved with helping share the message that there are places young people can turn to in times of hardship.”</p>
      <p>The partnership will see Square Enix promote Centrepoint’s campaigns via official Life is Strange channels throughout December. Paul Brocklehurst, the charity’s head of helpline, says that the campaign will hopefully “encourage people to look into how young people are living these scenarios in reality, and that there are things that can be done to support them.”</p>
