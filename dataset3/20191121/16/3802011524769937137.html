      <p>“I’m quite disturbed over social media messages which a friend sent to me coming from Riverton Academy school parents’ WhatsApp group in Masvingo where they were discussing how I put pressure on my son which led to him committing suicide.</p>
      <p>“People shouldn’t just start judging people without even knowing where they’re coming from, mwana aiterera and I just want him to rest in peace.</p>
      <p>“You see, the death of his dad triggered his depression because he was very close to him.”</p>
      <p>Her sentiments follow speculations which circulated on social media the day her son died as some said he committed suicide after she impregnated a girl while others pointed to drugs.</p>
      <p>She added:</p>
      <p>“When he wrote his “O” levels, he passed 10.</p>
      <p>“He enrolled at Churchill in boarding school to do sciences.</p>
      <p>“He started having challenges which I investigated, and it happened to be bullying then I took him out of boarding.</p>
      <p>“I got him private tutors too.</p>
      <p>“When he started mentioning about the fear of failing exams, we sat him down with his brother.</p>
      <p>“The brother explained to him how he failed ‘A’ levels twice and how I was supportive of him until his completion of a degree.</p>
      <p>“We brought him here in SA to seek medical attention with psychologists.</p>
      <p>“I went to Dubai and did shopping for him. I wanted to make him happy and I even went to his school to request for a transfer so that I’d take him with me back to SA to continue counselling with psychologists.</p>
      <p>“I was checking up on him and all was well.</p>
      <p>“The very day he committed suicide, I texted him and the previous night we spoke on the phone; he was happy.</p>
      <p>“All I can say is depression is a mental issue which needs medical attention and we just did that by taking him to the hospital where he got medication.”</p>
      <p>Jacobs added that she is now undergoing counselling sessions due to depression. <a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/i-tried-to-save-my-boy/"><b>H-Metro</b></a></p>
