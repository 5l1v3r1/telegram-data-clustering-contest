      <h1>Staff and pupils at Bestwood Village primary school officially open new £6.3m site</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:18:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Phoebe Ram</a></address>
      <p>A £6.3m primary school has officially opened in Bestwood Village to help with the future expansion of the area.</p>
      <p>The new building in the Westhouse Farm Development in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/basford">Bestwood</a> Village is the replacement home of Hawthorne Primary and Nursery School.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">school</a> was previously housed in a Victorian building, the original schoolhouse, but due to the increasing demand for places it had become unsuitable.</p>
      <p>Infants and juniors had to be split across two sites while work was carried out, but as of September 2019 they are now all under one roof.</p>
      <p>The build started in October 2018 and on Wednesday, November 21 an official opening was held.</p>
      <p>Head teacher Rachel Jarvis, who joined the school in 2017, said: "Compared to what we had before, it's amazing.</p>

      <p>"We are a very family-oriented school and it's really brought us all together.</p>
      <p>"The children love the new building and now that we are all under one roof, pupils can have their lunch together and the juniors make good role models for the younger ones.</p>
      <p>"Staff were saying it is so lovely to be able to sit together because it could have been a whole week before we met up with the different sites."</p>
      <p>The school currently has around 220 pupils but now has the capacity for 315 and land space for a potential 420.</p>
      <p>Mrs Jarvis added: "It's just lovely to come to work now, it's clean and warm. My office is so much bigger!"</p>
      <p>"Our new sensory 'rainbow' room is so much better because we have the facilities for more electrical equipment and it's more accessible.</p>
      <p>"We also have a proper library now instead of just two shelves with a cushioned area so you can really enjoy reading.</p>
      <p>"There are still some areas to develop and children will be able to make decisions as it's good to get their views."</p>
      <p>To celebrate the official opening of the school there was a ribbon cutting ceremony and every child has planted a tree in the grounds.</p>
      <p>There was cake for all the classes made by the school's teaching assistants and all the children performed in a special assembly.</p>
      <p>Two Conservative councillors also attended the opening alongside the architect and school governors.</p>
      <p>Councillor Chris Barnfather has campaigned for many years for the new school. He said: "The village had a 19th century school for all these years where the classrooms were never big enough.</p>
      <p>"It's been about six years that I have been campaigning and pushing for a new school.</p>
      <p>"I think due to the location of Bestwood Village, it often feels forgotten but the message here is that it is not forgotten.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to staff and children and they are all thrilled. Their school had been dark, with heavy brick and small windows but now there is so much light and space.</p>
      <p>"We had a presentation from each year group which was quite emotional. It makes it all worthwhile."</p>
      <p>Councillor Philip Owen who represents Nuthall and Kimberley said: "The school is very impressive and all the children and staff are delighted.</p>
      <p>"It was needed for effective learning and there is now a whole range of facilities.</p>
      <p>"The children's display of performances showed a high degree of confidence which bodes well for the future of Bestwood Village."</p>
