      <p>A casino employee was killed in an early morning blaze on Wednesday, said provincial fire officials in Kampot province.</p>
      <p>Kampong Trach district deputy police chief Nhean Sary said the victim, 29-year-old Chhng Maley, worked as a card dealer at Hatien Vegas Entertainment Resort near the Prek Chak border checkpoint next to Vietnam in Kampong Trach district.</p>
      <p>“Witnesses said that staff began fleeing the building without consideration for people who may have been inside and the victim died inside one of the rooms,” Sary said.</p>
      <p>He said Maley’s body was handed over to his family in Takeo province’s Lumchang commune in Samrong district.</p>
      <p>By the time firefighters arrived on the scene, staff from the casino had used 68 fire extinguishers to successfully control the fire and prevent it from spreading to other rooms.</p>
      <p>Sary, who is in charge of the district police’s Department of Fire Prevention, Extinguishing and Rescue, said officials deployed two fire engines to extinguish the flames.</p>
      <p>“Our on-site investigation concluded that the fire was caused by an electrical fault,” Sary said.</p>
      <p>Taing Dara, a relative of the victim, told The Post the casino had donated $1,000 towards Maley’s funeral expenses.</p>
      <p>“Of course I was not there, but I believe that my cousin was awake when the fire broke out and could not escape while others managed to flee successfully. I want his death to be further investigated,” Dara said.</p>
      <p>Provincial police chief Mao Chanmathurith said police had conducted an autopsy at the scene and checked the surveillance footage, but did not find anything amiss.</p>
      <p>“The victim staggered into his room at 3am as he was drunk. The fire broke out at 4:30am and all staff fled the premises but him.</p>
      <p>“After inspecting the site, specialists believe the victim may have been asleep and died from suffocation due to the smoke,” he said.</p>
