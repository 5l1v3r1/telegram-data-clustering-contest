      <p>Her fangirling antics have been the talk of the jungle, with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> star Jacqueline Jossa keen to get all the gossip from her famous campmates.</p>
      <p>Whether it's insider information from Caitlyn Jenner about the Kardashians or Girl Aloud feud news from Nadine Coyle, viewers just can't get enough of Jac's questions.</p>
      <p>In fact, some are saying Jacqueline has missed her calling and should swap acting for journalism.</p>

      <p>"Really, really good. I liked being in a girl band. I'm one of three sisters so I'm used to being around girls," came her reply.</p>

      <p>"It's fake news, it's not a thing," Nadine insisted.</p>
      <p>Viewers, however, clearly thought that it was a "thing" and hailed Jacqueline's gossip-getting skills.</p>

      <p>The former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/eastenders/">EastEnders</a> star then turned her attentions to "reforming" Nadine's group, with the actress telling the Bush Telegraph she'd happily join and take someone's place.</p>
      <p>Viewers seemed thrilled at the idea, with one saying Jacqueline deserved a "damehood" if she managed to get the band back together.</p>

      <p>However, one person who may not be a Jac fan is her fellow campmate <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-divided-over-rude-jacqueline-jossa-as-she-snaps-at-campmate/">Andrew Maxwell after the two "clashed"</a> during Wednesday night's show.</p>
