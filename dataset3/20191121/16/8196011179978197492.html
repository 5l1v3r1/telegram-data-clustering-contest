      <p>Gardaí have announced that they are investigating "potential breaches of Immigration Legislation" after 16 people were found aboard a ferry which has arrived in Rosslare.</p>
      <p>The Captain of the ferry alerted Gardaí just before 10am today that a number of people had been discovered in the trailer of an articulated tractor unit on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>A Garda statement has said that "all the individuals appear to be in good health" and are receiving medical assessment upon their arrival at Rosslare Port.</p>
      <p>Garda Immigration Officers attached to Wexford Garda Station, supported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, will also carry out an assessment on the immigration status of the 16 people found.</p>
      <p>The articulated truck has been detained, and the driver and owners of the vehicle are assisting Gardaí with their enquiries. Gardaí are investigating all the circumstances of the incident.</p>

      <p>Ambulances have entered a ferry carrying 16 people discovered in a sealed trailer.</p>
      <p>The Stena Line ferry arrived in Rosslare in Co Wexford in the Irish Republic at around 3pm on Thursday from Cherbourg in France.</p>
      <p>All those found by an employee were in good health and have been moved to a passenger lounge, the ferry company said.</p>
      <p>Two ambulances and several doctors’ cars and police cars drove onto the ship’s vehicle deck shortly after it docked in south-east Ireland.</p>
      <p>A large police and Immigration Bureau presence was visible around the port.</p>
      <p>Ian Hampton, Stena Line’s chief people and communications officer, confirmed an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection, reportedly after banging was heard on the side of the trailer shortly before 10am on Thursday.</p>
      <blockquote>Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel's arrival in Rosslare</blockquote>
      <p>He said: “During the Stena Horizon’s 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>“All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees.</p>
      <p>“Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel’s arrival in Rosslare.”</p>
      <p>Officers are expected to carry out assessments and searches of the container.</p>
      <p>A source inside the Irish Government told the PA news agency that officials in the Justice Department were only made aware of the incident after media reports.</p>
      <p>Opposition party Fianna Fail’s spokesman on justice Jim O’Callaghan expressed his shock and demanded a full investigation into the incident.</p>

      <p>“A full investigation must be launched into the discovery of up to 16 people being transported in the back of a lorry to Ireland,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery and needs to be tackled with fully resourced policing.</p>
      <p>“Recent events show unfortunately Ireland is playing a significant part in this crime. These traffickers have to be thoroughly policed so vulnerable people are protected.”</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a group of 25 people were found inside a refrigerated container on board a UK-bound ship just off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Last month, 39 people were found dead inside a container in Essex which had arrived in the UK via a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
