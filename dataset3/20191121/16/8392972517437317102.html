      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> have expressed their "disgust" with the panel today, accusing them of "glorifying" alcohol.</p>

      <p>And, in a confession that shocked many viewers, several of the panellists admitted they would "struggle" being in a relationship with a man who didn't drink booze.</p>
      <p>Nadia, whose husband Mark Adderley doesn't drink alcohol, said it "wasn't easy".</p>
      <p>Jane and Christine appeared to imply that an alcohol-free partner would have a negative effect on their relationships.</p>

      <p>The discussion came after reports that we tend to pick mates with the same gene variant linked to drinking habits.</p>

      <p>Christine said she and husband Frank enjoy alcohol when their busy schedules allow it, saying: "We both equally get excited and we're on completely the same level.</p>
      <p>"But if it was just me that wanted a glass of something and he didn't, that would really change our relationship."</p>

      <p>When Nadia asked if she would have been "put off" him if he were sober when they met, Christine replied: "Yeah probably yes."</p>
      <p>Nadia, in turn, admitted that living with a recovering alcoholic was "not easy".</p>
      <p>She said: "In my heart of hearts, there is a bit of putting up with it. It's not easy but, the way that I see it is, it keeps him alive.</p>
      <p>"But it doesn't mean that it's totally easy. If you've had a stressful day and you have those first few sips of wine."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rochelle said she wasn't sure it would affect her.</p>

      <p>Viewers at home were raging with the discussion, with one writing: "Honestly cannot believe what I am hearing on Loose Women.</p>
      <p>"To define who and what a relationship may be, because a person doesn't choose to drink alcohol! It says more about you as a person, than it does them!"</p>
      <p>Another said: "I truly don't understand the obsession with alcohol. I find it worrying that it seems like every presenter from <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> to Loose Women seems so focused on booze. To not date a non-drinker or to find them less attractive because they are teetotal is so weird."</p>
      <p>A third added: "2019 and there's still the stigma that, just because you don't drink alcohol, you're boring or don't know how to relax #LooseWomen."</p>
      <p>"Loose Women, I'm disgusted how you're glorifying drinking <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/billy-connolly-reveals-his-sons-addiction-battle/">alcohol</a>. It can cause epilepsy, depression, domestic violence. Shame on you!" said one more, while another said: "They pretty much said it would be the end of their relationship if their partner stopped drinking. Wow..."</p>
