      <h1>Consumer-versus-commodity idea ‘does not explain’ lower Irish milk price – ICMSA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:54:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">Sylvester Phelan</a></address>
      <p>Comments on the idea that Irish milk prices would “probably” remain lower than prices in the rest of the EU because Ireland “does not have a large consumer market” and is more reliant on a commodity market which pays less have been rejected by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers’ Association (ICMSA)..</p>
      <p>ICMSA president Pat McCormack responded in a statement in reaction to <a href="https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/cant-sit-on-our-hands-glanbia-chairman-on-price-and-expansion/">comments</a> made by Glanbia group chairman Martin Keane to Dutch media outlet <i>DairyGlobal</i> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The problem with this explanation is that Denmark does not have a large consumer market behind it either but still managed to pay a farmer milk price several cents per litre better than the ‘big three’ Irish milk processors managed, McCormack said.</p>
      <p>Continuing, he said: “Nor do we accept that Denmark’s proximity to the large German market and ease of access to that is the only explanation for their superior price.</p>
      <blockquote>We have relative proximity to the large British market – for now anyway – and we’re still four to 5c/L below what Danish milk suppliers are receiving.</blockquote>
      <p>“So we’d question whether access to a large consumer market is as decisive a price factor as is presented.</p>
      <p>“We have milk processors in Ireland that are a fraction the size of Glanbia but manage to pay 3c/L more; they don’t have a ‘large consumer market behind them’ either – how are they managing it?” McCormack asked.</p>
      <p>The president then turned to another argument, highlighting that Fonterra is almost completely commodity-focused, has a smaller domestic market and less access to nearby large urban consumer market than Irish processors but is paying a higher farmer milk price per litre than two Irish processors, going by the Dutch <a href="http://www.milkprices.nl/Reviews/eng201909.pdf">LTO milk price league</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>This consumer-versus-commodity idea does not explain why the current Irish milk price is so far down the league.</blockquote>
      <p>“The suspicion – and it’s very well founded – is that some of our co-ops are underpaying because they want to and they think they can,” McCormack concluded.</p>
