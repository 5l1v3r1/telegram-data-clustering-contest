      <p>LONDON — The Conservative Party amassed a vast pile of cash through donations during the first week of the U.K. election campaign — far more than any other party.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson’s party raised more than £5.6 million in large donations between November 6 and 12, <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/media-centre/donations-and-loans-received-political-parties-and-non-party-campaigners-uk-first-weekly-pre-poll">according to figures published by the Electoral Commission</a>. The figures include only donations above £7,500.</p>
      <p>Labour declared £218,500. The party’s chairman Ian Lavery said the campaign was funded with smaller donations. “While the Conservative Party is in the pockets of vested interests and the super-rich, we are proud that the Labour Party is funded by hundreds of thousands of people donating what they can afford to build a fairer society,” he said. “Labour is on the side of the people and the Tories are on the side of the billionaires.”</p>
      <p>Labour was fourth on the list, behind the Liberal Democrats on £275,000 and the Brexit Party on £250,000.</p>
      <p>However, Labour <a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/labours-people-powered-campaign-hits-1-million-in-small-donations-in-10-days/">announced on November 7</a> that it had raised more than £1 million for its election effort in the past 10 days. The party says the average small donation it has received at this election is £24.87.</p>
      <p>Tory donors included Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of former Russian government minister Vladimir Chernukhin, who gave £200,000 to the party, and travel company Trailfinders which donated half a million.</p>
      <p>Labour received £30,000 from the U.K.’s largest trade union, Unison, and £62,000 from the second-largest union, Unite.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems received £75,000 from investment bank Attestor Services and £60,000 from Italian hedge fund founder Davide Serra.</p>
      <p>The Brexit Party’s entire £250,000 donation came from financier and former Tory donor Jeremy Hosking.</p>
      <p>Six parties declared a total of more than £6.5 million in donations during the first week of the campaign, according to the Electoral Commission. That's slightly less than the £7 million raised in the first week of the 2017 election campaign.</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission will publish donation figures every week.</p>
