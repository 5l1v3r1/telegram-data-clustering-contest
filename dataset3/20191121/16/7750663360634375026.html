      <h1>How Tottenham Hotspur could line up against West Ham United</h1>
      <h2>All eyes will be on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> on Saturday as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a>'s new manager takes on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-ham-united/"><b>West Ham United</b></a> in the Premier League.</h2>

      <p>The 56-year-old, following almost a year out of management, was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">announced as the new Spurs manager</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Spurs, currently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">14th in the Premier League</a>, will now be expected to produce a response to the poor performances seen under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> so far this term.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how Mourinho may line up for his first game in charge.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Mourinho will head into this game knowing that Spurs have not won away in the Premier League since January, meaning that the Portuguese, above all, will look at how the North London side can exercise more control.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the 56-year-old will be conscious of shaking up the boat too rapidly, and will therefore encourage a similar 4-2-3-1 shape as endorsed in the later stages of the Pochettino reign.</p>
      <p>One player who may be on the way out is <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/serge-aurier/"><b>Serge Aurier</b></a>, who has perhaps made one too many mistakes at the back this term. <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/juan-foyth/"><b>Juan Foyth</b></a>, an energetic youngster, could get the nod instead.</p>
      <p>In the middle, Mourinho looks likely to abandon the idea of playing <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-dier/"><b>Eric Dier</b></a> in central defence and instead opt to partner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/davinson-sanchez/"><b>Davinson Sanchez</b></a> - a player he has praised in the past - with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toby-alderweireld/"><b>Toby Alderweireld</b></a>, who remains the club's best defender amid a dispute over his contract.</p>
      <p>When Mourinho took the Spurs job, a source of excitement would have been the partnership of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tanguy-ndombele/"><b>Tanguy Ndombele</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/moussa-sissoko/"><b>Moussa Sissoko</b></a> at the base of midfield, which closely reflects midfield pairings used in the past, from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/claude-makelele/"><b>Claude Makelele</b></a> to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/scott-mctominay/"><b>Scott McTominay</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nemanja-matic/"><b>Nemanja Matic</b></a>.</p>
      <p>One big question that many will ask, much like how they did about <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/juan-mata/"><b>Juan Mata</b></a> in 2016, will be whether <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-eriksen/"><b>Christian Eriksen</b></a> fits into the Mourinho mold.</p>
      <p>The player could be leaving next summer, but as a man fixated on results, Mourinho will want to give the Dane space out wide as a means of utilising his excellent ability to engineer the ball in tight spaces alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dele-alli/"><b>Dele Alli</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Using Eriksen in this way allows for Mourinho to compliment him on the other side with Heung-min Son, who has been one of Tottenham's best players since August.</p>
      <p>The incessant and calculated running of the Korean, combined with the nimble Eriksen, should lay a good platform for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/harry-kane/"><b>Harry Kane</b></a> to thrive at the London Stadium.</p>
