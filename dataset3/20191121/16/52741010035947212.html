      <p>EDMONTON — An environmental law firm is asking a court to strike down Alberta's inquiry into the role of foreign money financing the activities of charities opposing the oilsands.</p>
      <p>In its application, Ecojustice claims the province's inquiry into what it calls anti-Alberta activities is politically motivated, prejudges its conclusions and is outside provincial jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>The documents also alleges the inquiry's commissioner, Steve Allan, was a donor to the leadership campaign of Alberta's justice minister, who appointed him to the job.</p>
      <p>Ecojustice lawyer Devon Page says the inquiry is an example of a government trying to use a judicial process to stifle opinions it doesn't like.</p>
      <p>The application asks Calgary Court of Queen's Bench to quash the government order that created the inquiry.</p>
      <p>Allan has been interviewing witnesses as part of the $2-million probe.</p>
      <p>Last week, a prominent Edmonton community charity expressed similar reservations about the inquiry.</p>
      <p>It has also been criticized for awarded a million-dollar contract to a Calgary law firm in which Allan's son is a partner.</p>
      <p>This report by The Canadian Press was first published Nov. 21, 2019.</p>
