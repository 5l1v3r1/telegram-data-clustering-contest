        <b>Mouni Roy is not doing the Amitabh Bachchan starrer Chehre. It was a fab opportunity for her, it would have got her working with Big B for the second time so soon in her career. Read how Krystle Dsouza finally got in</b>
      </p>
      <p>After pinkvilla reported this morning that Krystle Dsouza was in talks for the Amitabh Bachchan Chehre, TimesofIndia.com ran a story after 2 hours that Krystle D'souza has been finalised for the same- a role which was originally being done by Kriti Kharbanda. Now, there's a BIG STORY to the entry of Krystle.</p>
      <p>Rewind: We were the first to break the<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/post-kriti-kharbanda-s-exit-chehre-makers-now-in-talks-with-tv-beauties-ankita-lokhande-mouni-roy-krystle-dsouza-exclusive/5dd5443387fb571eff7e42c2"> BIG story to you yesterday that Mouni Roy is one of the top 4 contenders for the role</a> (apart from Elnaaz Nourozi, Ankita Lokhande and Krystle Dsouza) which Kriti Kharbanda quit in the Amitabh Bachchan-Emraan Hashmi starrer Chehre, produced by Anand Pandit and directed by Rumi Jaffery. Well, it so happened that Mouni had her nose in the front in the race until last evening; she was Anand and Rumi's first choice.</p>

      <p>Since Kriti just left the film after shooting for only 2 days, it was obvious that Rumi and Anand wanted Mouni to start shooting almost immediately. A long delay would have only increased the film's budget. But, Mouni's diary is packed with certain commitments in the next few days which she couldn't back out from. Says a source, "Mouni told them 'No' with a very heavy heart, but not before wishing them all the luck."</p>

      <p>After her successful debut in the Akshay Kumar-led hit Gold, Mouni was recently seen playing the Gujarati wife in Made In China and next, she will be seen as the antagonist in Ayaan Mukerji's Brahmastra. Chehre would have been the second opportunity for Mouni to work with Bachchan if she had grabbed it. Brahmastra also stars Big B. Alas! Mouni had to let go Chehre.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image source:- instagram/krystledsouza/imouniroy</i></p>
