      <p>BJP leader Piyush Goyal on Thursday hit back on Congress for its allegations over the alleged electoral bond scam. Addressing the media, Piyush Goyal said that electoral bonds brought transparency and honest money into the electoral process.</p>
      <p>"Those failed to get honest and transparent money from electoral bonds are opposing it," Piyush Goyal said. Upping the ante against the Congress, which had alleged earlier in the day that electoral bonds were part of a scam, Goyal said, "Alliance of dejected politicians doesn't want tax-paid clean money in electoral politics."</p>
      <p>Goyal claimed that the Election Commission on the recommendations of PM Modi wanted to bring greater transparency into the system. "Earlier, there was a system to give a cash donation to political parties. Now, election bonds are connected with bank accounts. All accounts are attached to KYC norms. The SBI and its all branches are entitled to provide these bonds. The system is completely transparent and we have been able to check black money from our election system," he said.</p>
      <p>After the implementation of new rules, any individual or company can give cash donations to a political party up to Rs 2000. More than that has to be given through electoral bonds, which have been bought from designated SBI branches.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Congress sought an inquiry by a joint parliamentary committee into these "opaque" donations, which, it termed a "threat to democracy". Its chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala described it as a "modus operandi to receive thousands of crores from big business houses through secret donations".</p>
      <p>Citing news reports based on RTI documents, Surjewala had said, "The intrigue and the conspiracy have now indicted the prime minister himself. RTI documents now establish the role and indict none less than the prime minister himself."</p>
      <p>Congress raised the issue in both the Houses of Parliament on Thursday. The party also sought an early decision by the Supreme Court on the legality of these bonds.</p>
      <p>"Electoral bonds and their completely opaque nature is a fundamental threat to democracy. Democracy is a function of public trust," Congress leader Manish Tewari said.</p>
