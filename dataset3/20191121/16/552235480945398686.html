      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:54:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Brendan Rodgers insists his future lies with Leicester City after he was linked with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> job.</p>
      <p>It was reported that the former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> manager was Spurs' first choice to replace Mauricio Pochettino after he was sacked, before making the move for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> .</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail claimed that chairman Daniel Levy made a tentative enquiry about Rodgers' availability prior to Mourinho's appointment.</p>
      <p>When asked about the links Rodgers insisted he is happy and committed to the project at the Foxes.</p>

      <p>He said: "There is nothing to talk about on it. The game is full of gossip and speculation.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I will say is I was very happy here at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , I've literally just joined the club in February.</p>
      <p>"Everything has been great since we've been in. We have a project here that we want to develop over the next number of years.</p>
      <p>"That's my sole focus, along with the team and the staff and the club here. In this game, what I've learned is that you'll always be linked with jobs and speculation around other jobs, but what's most important is the now, and I'm very happy here to develop and work with the club in order to help them improve.</p>

      <p>"What happens in football now is that if you go through times when you're doing well and you work well, everyone wants to take you away from that.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy in my professional life. I'm very happy in my life personally in Leicestershire, it's a great place to live and work and we have created a real unity here at the club.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>"I came here with a responsibility to help Top (chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha), (chief executive) Susan Whelan, (director of football) Jon Rudkin and all the players and staff here, to help the club grow.</p>
      <p>"In my time here that is what I'll aim to do. How long that will be you can never tell but I am very happy to be here."</p>
