      <p>The officer, who has not yet been named publicly, is reportedly an 17-year veteran of the Detroit Police Department.</p>
      <p>The murdered officer and his partner were responding to a home break-in on Wyoming and Pembroke avenues where an armed intruder had entered a private home. Four officers arrived at the scene and entered the house.</p>
      <p>The suspect inside the home soon opened fire killing one officer and wounding his partner in the leg. The suspect was also wounded, but it now in stable condition.</p>
