      <p>Just when you thought you didn’t need another <i>Emma</i> adaptation, <i>Emma</i> [<i>With a Period</i>] tips its bonnet to you and says, you silly thing! The 1996 adaptation of Jane Austen’s novel <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/08/21-jane-austen-movies-and-miniseries-ranked.html">starring Gwyneth Paltrow</a> is easily one of the actress’s most iconic roles. It’s right up there with her stint on Jon Favreau’s cooking show, where she <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/gwyneth-paltrow-tom-holland-graham-norton-show.html">forgot she was in <i>Spider-Man: Homecoming</i></a><i>. </i>That’s art. But the new <i>Emma, </i>directed by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2011/01/decemberists.html">Autumn de Wilde</a> and written by Man Booker Prize winner <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/10/28-year-old-eleanor-catton-wins-the-man-booker.html">Eleanor Catton</a>, has all the riotous rich people antics we’ve come to love — nay! — crave. <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/03/anya-taylor-joy-profile.html">Anya Taylor-Joy</a> stars as the too-clever-for-her-own-good Emma, backed up by Johnny Flynn, Bill Nighy, Mia Goth, and more. Emma can’t help but pry into everyone’s love lives, creating a fumbling, confused, potentially hilarious mess. And this is just the teaser trailer. <i>Emma </i>will be in theaters come February.</p>
