      <h1>High-stakes co-op shooter GTFO coming soon to Early Access</h1>
      <h2>But first, a beta test</h2>

      <p><i>GTFO</i> is a horror-leaning cooperative FPS from some of the people behind <i>Payday: The Heist</i>, and it looks stressful – like, the <i>good kind </i>of stressful. The kind that makes you cherish quiet moments.</p>
      <p>10 Chambers Collective is almost ready for <i>GTFO</i> to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/493520/GTFO/">Steam Early Access</a> "hopefully later this year." Until then, here's a refresher that doubles as a case for why Early Access is probably the right call.</p>

      <p>As the video makes clear, you and your three fellow players will be funneled into a monster-filled underground complex with too few bullets and gadgets to ever truly feel safe. The deeper you go in <i>GTFO</i>, the more you'll need to coordinate and ration your supplies to stand a chance of surviving.</p>
      <p><i>GTFO</i> is using a system called The Rundown to shepherd players into different parts of the facility. Expeditions will stick around for a finite amount of time, at which point they'll be cleared out and a new set of missions will replace them. In essence, it's a way for the creators to keep things fresh.</p>
      <p>As an example, while it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../gtfo-is-a-co-op-horror-shooter-built-on-communication-508830.phtml">pays to be cautious</a> (what with all the creepy-crawlers slinking around), "there will be expeditions that are designed to not focus on stealth, where you will get more ammo," <a href="https://twitter.com/TenChambers/status/1197502761371197441">the studio said on Twitter</a>. "Although then you can expect more angry enemies too! <i>GTFO</i> will never be easy!"</p>
      <p>According to 10 Chambers founder Ulf Andersson, the game's Early Access run is meant to help the team figure out "How many expeditions should be in a Rundown versus how long it lasts, what kinds of flavors different expedition can have, etcetera. It will be a period of trials and experimentation that we think will be very interesting for the hardcore co-op gamer crowd."</p>
      <p>If you're curious, a beta test for <i>GTFO</i> is coming before the Early Access release. <a href="http://www.gtfothegame.com/">Sign up here</a>.</p>
