      <p>The trial of a veteran republican on charges relating to the murder and secret burial of Jean McConville cost the public purse over £100,000, it can be revealed.</p>
      <p>Ivor Bell, 82, was found not guilty of two charges of soliciting the 1972 murder of the mother-of-10 following the collapse of a trial of the facts earlier this year.</p>
      <p>The legal process to establish the truth of the allegations came in November came after Mr Bell was found medically unfit to stand trial in December 2018.</p>

      <p>The prosecution case against Mr Bell centred on taped interviews given by a person referred to as Z to Boston College’s Belfast Project.</p>
      <p>But the trial collapsed after Mr Justice O’Hara ruled that the Boston Tapes were unreliable and could not be used as evidence against Mr Bell.</p>
      <p>The judge told the Belfast Crown Court that the evidence Z was Mr Bell was “overwhelming”, but described interviewer Anthony McIntyre as “not neutral”, and had an agenda against the peace process and Gerry Adams.</p>
      <blockquote>The decision to prosecute Ivor Bell was entirely in line with the duty of the PPS to put before the courts those cases in which it is considered there is a reasonable prospect of conviction, and in which prosecution is in the public interest<cite>Public Prosecution Service</cite></blockquote>
      <p>The PA news agency can reveal more than £100,000 was spent on the prosecution attempt following a Freedom of Information act request to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).</p>
      <p>The PPS disclosed that costs for legal counsel were £107,377 while witness costs were £2,109, creating a total bill of £109,486.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the PPS said they were satisfied it had met the test for prosecution.</p>
      <p>The trial was the first time the McConville family had seen a prosecution attempt in connection with the murder, and came almost 50 years after their mother was snatched from their home in west Belfast.</p>
      <p>Five of Mrs McConville’s seven surviving children – Archie, Michael, Thomas (Tucker), Susan and Jim – attended every day of the eight-day trial of the facts.</p>

      <p>Mr McIntyre told PA he felt the prosecution attempts had been a “waste of time” and claimed it had brought people “no closer to getting the truth than they were at the start of it”.</p>
      <p>But Michael McConville said that for his family it had been about “more than money”.</p>
      <p>“I found the trial helpful, there were things said in court that we hadn’t known about,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s the first time anyone was up in court, I had never thought there would be a court case so it was nice to see.</p>
      <p>“It was about more than money.”</p>
      <blockquote>I would defend very strongly on the grounds that I at no time prompted anybody to give me an answer that I believed to not be true. I invited people to speak to me candidly<cite>Anthony McIntyre</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Mr McConville said his family wants to see a public inquiry into what happened and why after their mother’s murder, he and his siblings were separated by social services.</p>
      <p>Responding to Mr Justice O’Hara’s comments that his style of questioning had been leading, Mr McIntyre said: “I don’t see any point in asking a question that doesn’t lead somewhere, and I would defend very strongly on the grounds that I at no time prompted anybody to give me an answer that I believed to not be true. I invited people to speak to me candidly.</p>
      <p>“I would do it differently today but would I change my interview technique? No I wouldn’t … was it courtroom standard, of course not, it was never intended for the courtroom.”</p>
      <p>A PPS spokesperson said: “The decision to prosecute Ivor Bell was entirely in line with the duty of the PPS to put before the courts those cases in which it is considered there is a reasonable prospect of conviction, and in which prosecution is in the public interest.</p>
      <p>“All decisions were taken by a team of senior and experienced prosecutors fully in accordance with the Test for Prosecution. The PPS is satisfied that this case was properly conducted.</p>
      <p>“All fees to counsel in connection with the case were assessed and paid in line with the Prosecution Fee Scheme.”</p>
