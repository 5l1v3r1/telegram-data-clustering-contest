      <h2>WARNING: UPSETTING IMAGES The post showing a small child's lungs who suffocated on a peanut has convinced hundreds of parents to make a change</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:08:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:08</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Matthews, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/luke-matthews/</a></address>
      <p>Every parent will be familiar with the time spent cutting and slicing their children's food to ensure they can eat with no issues.</p>
      <p>No matter how hard you try, there's always a chance their wandering hands will pick up something they shouldn't and potentially put them in danger.</p>
      <p>Seeing a little one begin to choke can strike fear and panic into any mum or dad as you quickly attempt to help dislodge the thing blocking their airways.</p>
      <p>A nursing unit has shared an incredibly powerful photo to demonstrate just how easy it is for a child to choke on food, and gave advice on what parents can do to decrease the chances of it happening.</p>

      <p>Nursing CPD uploaded an image to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nursingcpdunits/photos/a.164358651010971/542378286542337/?type=3&amp;theater">Facebook</a> showing the lungs of a small child who died of suffocation after choking on a peanut.</p>
      <p>It said: "Peanuts and other nuts are the size of the airway of a child younger than four to five years.</p>
      <p>"The risk of death from suffocation is real, but it is avoidable.</p>
      <p>"Please do not offer to small children: whole dry fruits, popcorn, nuts nor any food that may resemble the size of small candies.</p>
      <p>"Death cannot be reversed. It is best to prevent."</p>
      <p>The image has since been shared more than 9,000 times and attracted more than 2,000 comments from other parents who said the 'scary' real-life example had made them think twice about the food they give to their children.</p>
      <p>The page then <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nursingcpdunits/posts/542983899815109?hc_location=ufi">shared a diagram</a> of how to cut food to help reduce the risk of choking, showing a grape which had been cut length-ways rather than across the width to make them less obstructive.</p>
      <p>One commenter said: "Okay, definitely smaller pieces of food from now on!"</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "I see this stuff all the time. It’s why I’m crazy."</p>
