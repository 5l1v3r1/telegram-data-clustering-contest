        <i>Mexican sculpture and accidental homage to singer may be the ‘largest baby Jesus statue’ created</i>
      </p>
      <p>A church in Mexico has revealed a huge statue of baby Jesus that bears an uncanny resemblance to the British singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/phil-collins">Phil Collins</a>.</p>
      <p>The sculpture stands at 6.7 metres tall and weighs 900kg, a potential new world record for a baby Jesus statue.</p>
      <p>Sculpted by Roman Salvador, the work was only intended to “fit the church” in the town of Guadalupe, a local priest, Humberto Rodriguez, told Central European News.</p>
      <p>“There is a space of between 26ft between the ceiling and the floor and I ordered a statue measuring 21ft, but I never intended to make it the biggest baby Jesus statue in the world,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, he did not comment on the inadvertent likeness to Collins, which people were quick to point out as images of the statue began to spread online.</p>

      <p>The Mexican paper El Sol de Puebla published tweets showing Collins-related memes of the figure, while others have noted that the statue also resembles the actor Nicolas Cage.</p>
      <p>Collins, the former frontman and drummer with the 70s rock group Genesis, also had a successful solo career with hits such as In The Air Tonight and Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now).</p>

      <p>Rodriguez, the priest for the church of La EpifanÍa del Señor, said he had contacted the Guinness World Records to confirm the new record.</p>
      <p>The church would hold the title for largest baby Jesus statue if its submission is successful. The current record stands at 4.8 metres tall and 299kg.</p>
