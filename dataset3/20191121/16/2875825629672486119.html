      <h1>English rugby player Joe Marler imitates 'Irish horse' in bizarre and hilarious interview ahead of Harlequins clash with Bath</h1>
      <h2>The video has been viewed 500k times online and baffled Twitter users</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:21:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/andrew-byrne/" target="_blank">Andrew Byrne</a></address>
      <p>A pro <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rugby-union">rugby</a> player imitated an "Irish horse" in a bizarre interview on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/harlequins-fc-rugby-union">Harlequins FC</a> and English international star, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/joe-marler">Joe Marler</a>, compared himself to an "Irish horse" in an interview with his club's media channel after a recent loss.</p>
      <p>Marler describes the hurt he felt after the recent defeat and said the team has to "get back on the horse".</p>
      <p>Marler takes the classic cliche answer and embarks on a tale about a horse who wants to "give a better performance" this weekend against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/bath-rugby">Bath</a>.</p>
      <p>He said: "I wasn't hurting as much as the lads who were out there but I definitely felt it and I know how hard the boys have taken that.</p>

      <p>"They'll be disappointed with the account that we put out but we have got another week to get back on the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/horses">horse</a> and take that horse to the water and you can ask that horse and say, 'Hey, horsey, do you want to have a drink or do you want to swim?'</p>
      <p>"And it's up to that horse to then realise what he wants to do in his life.</p>
      <p>"And that horse, at the moment, wants to go out on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"He wants to clippidy-clop all the way to The Stoop and he wants to say 'hello' to those fans.</p>
      <p>"And he goes: 'I'm sorry about the result last week, but I'm going to give a better performance here at home against Bath.'</p>

      <p>After attempting to bizarrely imitate a 'horse' voice in that last sentence, he continued: "He's a slightly Irish horse."</p>
      <p>The bizarre video has been viewed 597k times on the Harlequins Twitter channel, with fans and viewers loving the interview.</p>
      <p>One fan said: "Absolutely brilliant! Funny as, Joe. Thanks for making us laugh.</p>
      <p>"It's great to see a professional sportsman still show his character.</p>
      <p>"Go well against Bath."</p>
      <p>Another added: "If there's no actual horse at the game on Saturday I'm going to be very upset now."</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user said: "Joe Marler needs to do a 'one man show'. He was first class on Wossy the other night."</p>
      <p>Harlequins play Bath at 5.30pm on Saturday evening.</p>
