      <h1>Convicted terrorists on Riau Islands Police radar following Medan suicide attack</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Fadli</a></address>
      <p>The Riau Islands Police are monitoring former members of the Katibah Gonggong Rebus (KGR) radical group following a suicide bombing at the Medan Police headquarters in North Sumatra.</p>
      <p>Members of the KCR were accused in 2016 of plotting a rocket strike against Singapore.</p>
      <p>Riau Islands Police chief Insp. Gen. Andap Budi Revianto said recently that former terror convicts would also be required to participate in a deradicalization program. The program will be run by two police directorates: the community guidance directorate (Dirbimas) and the intelligence and security directorate.</p>
      <p>“Apart from the KGR, another group will also be monitored, although I can’t reveal more details about it at this time. The force has put both groups on our deradicalization radar,” Andap told<i> The Jakarta Post</i> recently</p>
      <p>The police chief, however, failed to mention whether members of the two groups had participated in a deradicalization program organized by the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) and the Social Affairs Ministry.</p>
      <p>The East Jakarta District Court convicted in 2017 six members of Batam-based KGR for their involvement in the radical group as well as plotting a terror attack against the neighboring city-state of Singapore.</p>
      <p>The six convicted members -- Eka Saputra, Trio Safrido, Tarmizi, Gigih Rahmat Dewa, Hadi Gusti Yanda and Leonardo Hutajulu -- were believed to be supporters of Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian militant who supported the Islamic State (IS) terrorist group in Syria, who was reportedly killed in a drone strike during counterterrorism operations in 2018.</p>
      <p>While Rahmat was sentenced to four years in prison, the others were only sentenced to three years.</p>

      <p>Riau Islands acting governor Isdianto said the provincial administration had also become a spearhead for deradicalization to prevent the spread of radical beliefs among the people. </p>
      <p>In Batam, two institutions have been allocated funds and tasked with addressing deradicalization, namely the Coordination Forum for the Prevention of Terrorism (FKPT) and the Interfaith Communication Forum (FKUB).</p>
      <p>“I believe cooperation among law enforcers and the regional administration will succeed in preventing the spread of radical beliefs,” Isdianto said.</p>
      <p>A former participant of the deradicalization program -- identified only as YI -- however, said the current program was ineffective in assisting participants to find a way to make a living, which was one of the program’s main purposes.</p>
      <p>YI was a former migrant worker who was deported from Singapore on suspicion of being involved in a radical group. After her deportation, she participated in a two-month deradicalization program run by the BNPT and the Social Affairs Ministry.</p>
      <p>“Most of the time during the program was spent eating and sleeping. An NGO later provided assistance by giving as capital to open a business. However, my fried banana chip business in Cilacap failed,” YI told the <i>Post</i> recently.</p>
      <p>She currently lives in Batam with her children and husband, who works as a security guard. (kuk)</p>
