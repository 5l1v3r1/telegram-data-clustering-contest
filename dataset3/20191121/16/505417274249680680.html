      <h1>McIlroy Caps Off Fast Start In Dubai With Stunning Eagle On The 18th</h1>

        <b>Rory McIlroy finished off a blistering first round at the <a href="https://twitter.com/EuropeanTour">DP World Tour Championship</a> in Dubai with a stunning second shot to set-up an eagle putt on the 18th.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mike Lorenzo-Vera leads McIlroy by one shot after finishing with an incredible nine-under-par 63. The World number two looked to be struggling midway through the round hitting bogeys on the ninth, 12th and 14th holes after a promising start.</p>
      <p>However, he mounted a late rally with two birdies and an eagle on the final three holes to set himself up with a good opportunity to take home a fifth tournament win of 2019.</p>

      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/golf/oisinmcqueirns2758/big-boost-for-rory-mcilroy-in-world-golf-rankings-following-players-win/">McIlroy</a> has won two of the last three tournaments where he has started with a round of 67 or lower and will be feeling confident heading into the weekend after hitting what he described as one of his best shots of the year.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, it’s possibly the best shot I’ve hit all year,” McIlroy told Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>“I had 291 to the pin. Wind was off the left so it was a nice one for me to just aim straight at the pin and know if I hit my little draw, it should hold but if it gets going with the wind, the bunker on the right is better than the water on the left. I just flushed it.</p>

      <p>“I sort of carry my 3-wood off the deck about 280 yards, so it was right on the limit but as soon as I hit it, I knew it was perfect.</p>
      <p>“It was right out of the middle. Great to finish like that, and yeah, it was a great round of golf.”</p>
