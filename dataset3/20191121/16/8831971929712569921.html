      <h1>How To Handle A Date Who Flaked &amp; You Want To Make It Work</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:45:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/candidwithconstance/" target="_blank">Constance Kalpakis</a></address>
      <p>We’ve all come across a flake, and if you haven’t, you may want to reevaluate the number of times you’ve canceled out of being lazy, tired, or too busy.</p>
      <p>However, if you’re on the other end of that “can’t make it text,” and you still want to try and make things work, here’s how you do it.</p>
      <p>First you need to recognize that you aren’t a priority to them. I know it’s shocking, <i>you?!</i> But it’s true, otherwise they would’ve taken the plans more seriously and made the effort to follow through because it meant that much to them. It’s still kind of disrespectful, but there’s nothing you can really do to change that about them.</p>

      <p>Sometimes they have a valid excuse, and you can tell they meant well. If they seem sincere, totally forgive them with a minor grudge hiding behind it. Major points for them if they try and reschedule themselves, which you should go ahead and plan if you really think they deserve the second chance.</p>
      <p>If they don’t offer to reschedule, take it upon yourself to ask. If they aren’t down with it, or they seem a little off about, abort mission. You should be important enough for them to want to make it work for you, especially when you’re trying hard and looking like you’re doing all the work.</p>
      <p>Sometimes we get distracted by our emotions or we’re just in denial that someone would intentionally excuse themselves to not go out with us. Don’t let someone cloud the fact that you’re awesome and deserve someone who can’t wait to see you next.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind the way you’re feeling about seeing them, and think about if they reciprocate those feelings. You should chase after someone you know is worth your time, effort, and affection, and if this person doesn’t seem like they deserve it, then by all means don’t give it to them.</p>
