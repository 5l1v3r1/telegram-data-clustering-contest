      <p>In the suit Mompha filed before the Lagos State High Court in Igbosere, Mompha is demanding N5 million against the antigraft agency, EFCC for putting him in detention beyond the constitutionally-allowed period without being charged to court.</p>
      <p>He prayed the court to set him free if the EFCC is not ready to charge him to court.</p>
      <p>Recall the EFCC had in October arrested the internet celebrity in Abuja on his way to Dubai, based on <i>“actionable cross-border intelligence received from collaborative law enforcement agencies about his alleged involvement in the criminal activities.”</i></p>
      <p>The anti-graft agency said, “Ismaila, who allegedly perpetrates his fraudulent activities under the guise of being a bureau de change operator, is always seen with his little son flaunting huge amount of foreign currencies on his social media platforms.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Investigations have also revealed that Ismaila is only using the BDC business he jointly owned with his siblings as a decoy to launder his proceeds of crime.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mompha’s lawyer, Mr Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), said his client, as a Nigerian, was entitled to the protection of his fundamental rights under sections 34, 35 and 36 of the 1999 constitution.</p>
      <p>Oyewole said his client was arrested on October 19 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja by the EFCC which accused him of money laundering.</p>
      <p>He said the remand order which the EFCC obtained to keep Mompha had since expired and he ought to be released.</p>
      <p>The court has yet to fix any date to hear the case.</p>
