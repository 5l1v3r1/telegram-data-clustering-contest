      <p>Israel's President <a href="https://www.wionews.com/south-asia/israeli-president-starts-process-of-selecting-next-pm-210524">Reuven Rivlin</a> tasked parliament Thursday with finding a new prime minister, as he sought to avoid new elections after incumbent <a href="https://www.wionews.com/opinions/donald-trump-benjamin-netanyahu-encouraging-a-nuclear-race-249181">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> and rival Benny Gantz each failed to form a government.</p>
      <p>"Starting today and for 21 days the decision of who to task with forming the government is in the hands of the members of the Knesset (parliament)," Rivlin said, a day after Gantz admitted he would be unable to build a governing coalition.</p>
      <p>Parliament will now have until December 11 to find a candidate who can command the support of the majority of the country's 120 MPs or a new general election will be called for early 2020.</p>
      <p>It would be the third such poll within 12 months.</p>
      <p>Rivlin, who has been urging a compromise to break the political deadlock, met with Knesset speaker <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/israel-ngo-bill-seen-as-targeting-left-wing-groups-becomes-law-2312">Yuli Edelstein</a> Thursday and formally handed over the mandate.</p>
      <p>It was the first time in Israeli history the president had been forced to ask parliament to find a government.</p>
      <p>"The disruptive politics must end," Rivlin said, addressing MPs from all parties. </p>
      <p>He reminded them they have a responsibility to keep the country running and said: "Your political fate is not more important than the fate of an old lady in a hospital."</p>
      <p>Polls in September left Netanyahu's rightwing Likud party and Gantz's centrist Blue and White coalition near neck-and-neck.</p>
