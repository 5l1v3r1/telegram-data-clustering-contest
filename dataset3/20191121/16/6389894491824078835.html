      <p>Plumbing supplies company Ferguson today suffered a bruising pay revolt after almost a third of shareholders voted against its remuneration policy.</p>
      <p>Just under 30 per cent of investors voted against Ferguson’s remuneration policy at the company’s annual general meeting today, while a quarter opposed its directors’ pay policy.</p>

      <p>The backlash came after the blue chip company hiked the maximum award limit for its long-term incentive plan - a move it described as “appropriate and fair”.</p>
      <p>Shares in Ferguson were marginally lower in afternoon trading.</p>
      <p>“The board is disappointed that a minority voted against these resolutions, as we consulted extensively but some of those we contacted failed to engage with us, despite the efforts on our part,” Ferguson said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“However, the remuneration committee continues to believe that the proposals are in the best interests of Ferguson and its shareholders.”</p>
      <p>The plumbing specialist has recently carried out a boardroom reshuffle, and today confirmed that chairman Gareth Davies has been replaced by former Ashted boss Geoff Drabble.</p>
      <p>Chief executive John Martin stepped down earlier this week and was replaced by Ferguson’s US boss Kevin Murphy.</p>
      <p>Ferguson last month posted profit of $1.6bn (£1.3bn) in the year to the end of July, up seven per cent on the previous year and ahead of expectations.</p>

      <p>The company has embarked on a cost-cutting strategy ahead of its planned demerger, in which it will spin off its UK business under the Wolseley brand and focus its core business on the North American market.</p>
