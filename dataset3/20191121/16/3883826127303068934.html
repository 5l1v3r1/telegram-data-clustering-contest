        <b>A Wetherspoon's customer who had a banana sent to his table in an act of racial abuse is boycotting the pub.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mark D'arcy-Smith was drinking with a friend at The Richmal Crompton in Bromley, south-east London, on 8 November, when the fruit arrived on a plate with a receipt.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old said he "froze" when staff gave it to him and was left feeling "upset, shocked and scared".</p>
      <p>Wetherspoon said it had apologised to Mr D'arcy-Smith.</p>
      <p>The pub chain has an app that allows customers to order food and drink and have it delivered to a table.</p>
      <p>The Met Police said it was investigating the "racially aggravated public order offence". No arrests have been made.</p>

      <p>Mr D'arcy Smith said: "I looked at my friend and he knew straight away. We both thought this is wrong.</p>
      <p>"I had this rush of emotions - I was upset, a little bit angry, shocked and scared. I just froze in place.</p>
      <p>"I don't think a lot of people understand what racial abuse is like.</p>
      <p>"You are essentially saying a black person is not human and they are an animal."</p>
      <p>In a statement, Wetherspoon said it had apologised to Mr D'arcy Smith for any distress caused.</p>
      <p>"This is now a police matter," a spokesman added.</p>
      <p>"We have responded to the customer and pointed out that the pub cannot be held responsible for app orders."</p>
