      <p>The three-time Grand Slam champion confessed to being "selfish" during his long lay off from the game and not thinking about the feelings of those close to him.</p>
      <p>However, he insisted Kim, 31, was "brilliant" throughout the ordeal and encouraged him to return to the sport.</p>
      <p>Murray, 32, is now back playing after undergoing a hip resurfacing operation earlier this year and the couple's third child, a boy called Teddy, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4947093/andy-murray-son-teddy-name/">was born last month</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/4927377/andy-murray-resurfacing-amazon-prime-documentary/">An Amazon documentary on his comeback</a> to be released later this month will show the impact the injury had on his family life.</p>
      <p>Murray said: "I was pretty down, that's for sure. It was a really tough period for me because it wasn't so much the actual injury itself.</p>
      <p>"Being injured can be frustrating, but the issue that I had was with me every single day, sleeping and walking.</p>

      <p>"It wasn't just I hit a serve and my arm hurt. This woke me up in the night. It was bad.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if the children noticed because when I'm with them I'm always trying to put on a brave face, but my wife definitely.</p>
      <p>"It put a lot of strain on our relationship, just because I was down all the time."</p>
      <p>He added: "She has been brilliant and I would probably be quite selfish, just in terms of thinking about myself and how I'm feeling all the time and not actually realising the impact that has on all the people around me.</p>
      <p>"When everyone was trying to encourage me to keep going and keep trying and keep playing, I was, like, 'You don't know what it's like. You don't know what it is that I'm feeling.'</p>
      <p>"I probably didn't take into consideration what that was doing to everyone around me. I see a little of this in the documentary. Some bits of it are quite hard for me to watch.</p>
      <p>"It had an impact on the team, and my physio's family as well. He'll be disappointed and sad each time he goes home that he's not been able to fix my hip, that I'm still in pain or I've had a rough day."</p>
      <p>Murray met Kim, whose father Nigel Sears is a tennis coach, in 2005. And they married in his hometown of Dunblane in 2015.</p>
      <p>The couple also have two daughters, Sophia, three, and two-year-old Edie.</p>
      <p>Murray is in action for the GB team at the Davis Cup in Madrid this week where he has said that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/tennis/10372526/andy-murray-davis-cup-challenge-chocolate/">eating too much after the birth of Teddy</a> had left him 'overweight'.</p>
