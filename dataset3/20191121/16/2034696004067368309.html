      <p><i>Reject False Icons</i> is directed by Denholm Hewlett, the son of Gorillaz’ Jamie, who, as a synopsis of the film details, “followed the band’s every move for three years, covering the making of two critically acclaimed albums, ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/gorillaz-humanz-review-nme-2017">Humanz</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/gorillaz-the-now-now-album-review">The Now Now</a>’, as well as the band’s most ambitious world tour to date encompassing dates across Europe, North America, South America and Mexico, bookended by its own Demon Dayz Festivals in the UK and US.”</p>
      <p>The film promises to be “the first ever all-access immersive journey into the world of Gorillaz and its extended family.”</p>
