      <h1>Internet celebrity, Mompha, sues EFCC, demands N5m</h1>

      <p>Oladimeji Ramon</p>
      <p>Internet celebrity, Ismaila Mustapha, alias Mompha, has filed a fundamental rights enforcement suit against the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, alleging unlawful detention and a violation of his rights.</p>
      <p>He was arrested by the EFCC in October on allegation of cybercrime and money laundering.</p>
      <p>In the suit he filed before the Lagos State High Court in Igbosere, Mompha is urging the court to award N5m against the EFCC for detaining him beyond the constitutionally-allowed period without being charged to court.</p>
      <p>He prayed the court to order the EFCC to either immediately charge him to court or release him if it was not ready to charge him to court.</p>
      <p>His lawyer, Mr Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), said his client, as a Nigerian, was entitled to the protection of his fundamental rights under sections 34, 35 and 36 of the 1999 constitution.</p>
      <p>Oyewole said his client was arrested on October 19 at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja by the EFCC which accused him of money laundering.</p>
      <p>He said the remand order which the EFCC obtained to keep Mompha had since expired and he ought to be released.</p>
      <p>In a 20-paragraph supporting affidavit, one Olumuyiwa Ajidagba claimed that “The applicant (Mompha) has been subjected to physical, mental and psychological torture in the underground cell of the EFCC’s detention centre.”</p>
      <p>The court has yet to fix any date to hear the case.</p>
      <p>The EFCC had said in October that it arrested the internet celebrity in Abuja on his way to Dubai, based on “actionable cross-border intelligence received from collaborative law enforcement agencies about his alleged involvement in the criminal activities.”</p>
      <p>The anti-graft agency said, “Ismaila, who allegedly perpetrates his fraudulent activities under the guise of being a bureau de change operator, is always seen with his little son flaunting huge amount of foreign currencies on his social media platforms.</p>
      <p>“Investigations have also revealed that Ismaila is only using the BDC business he jointly owned with his siblings as a decoy to launder his proceeds of crime.”</p>
