      <h2>Gerard Porteous left his victim "screeching" so loudly that a witness thought it was the noise of an animal.</h2>

      <p>A sick individual who repeatedly raped a woman in Coatbridge over a six-year-period has been given a life sentence behind bars.</p>
      <p>Serial rapist Gerard Porteous' victim in this instance came forward to report the assaults three-years-ago after she saw a news report about him being jailed for 12 years for other attacks.</p>
      <p>He was convicted after a trial at Glasgow's High Court last year, at which jurors heard how he regularly abused the woman in his home between 1987 and 1993.</p>
      <p>A witness in the case revealed she previously heard the victim "screeching" to such an extent she assumed it was the noise of an animal.</p>
      <p>The woman came forward after reading that he had been imprisoned for raping and abusing a number of women between 1994 and 2013.</p>
      <p>He also attacked another woman at the Coatbridge property after trying to visit the victim, who had previously tried to escape from depraved Porteous.</p>
      <p>He sexually assaulted her while they were alone in the house.</p>

      <p>After the victim recalled feeling "numb" as well as "terrified", prosecutor Steven Borthwick jurors: "Porteous did not say a word. He instead grabbed her and pushed her face against a wall.</p>
      <p>"After he was finished, he spat in her face and said: 'Aye, you can go now'."</p>
      <p>Porteous insisted any intercourse with the initial woman was consensual and that nothing happened with the other victim.</p>
      <p>Lord Mulholland told Porteous he will be in prison for a minimum of six years.</p>
      <p>He added: "You have been convicted of serious crimes of violence and rape.</p>
      <p>"This involved two victims and you subjected them to horrific ordeals.</p>
      <p>"This [six-year sentence] is the minimum period and should not be thought as reflecting my view of when you should be released."</p>
