      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Ever wondered who the biggest diva in the Newcastle United dressing room is?</p>
      <p>Or who the biggest joker is? Who picks up the most fines on the training ground?</p>
      <p>Well wonder no more as Christian Atsu has spilled the beans on his <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Magpies</a> team-mates in a hilarious YouTube feature on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpPdn3KsvfA">club's in-house channel.</a></p>
      <p>So which player reminds <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/chrisitian-atsu">Atsu</a> of legendary WWE star 'The Great Khali'? Who spends the most time in front of the mirror? And who is most likely to become a manager in the future?</p>
      <p>Here is what Atsu had to say.</p>
      <h3>Who is the biggest diva?</h3>
      <p>"[Matt] Ritchie. Always in training he is always moaning when he loses, he is fighting, so I will give it to Ritchie."</p>
      <h3>Who spends the most time in front of the mirror?</h3>
      <p>"I have seen a lot of players doing that. Maybe Fabian [Schar]."</p>
      <h3>Who would you not like to get in a fight with?</h3>
      <p>"Jamaal [Lascelles]. He is too big for me. He is like the Great Khali!"</p>

      <h3>Who takes the most selfies?</h3>
      <p>"[DeAndre] Yedlin. Always, he is always on his phone trying to post pictures on Instagram."</p>
      <h3>Who is the joker of the group?</h3>
      <p>"Yedlin again. He is always trying to crack jokes and he is always smiling in the dressing room so I will give it to him."</p>
      <h3>Who do you think will be a future manager?</h3>
      <p>"Maybe me. I have been doing a coaching course and when I have been playing I have always tried to study the game.</p>
      <p>"So you never know, maybe I will be a future manager."</p>
      <h3>Who is the nutmeg king?</h3>
      <p>"Allan [Saint-Maximin]. This guy is a joke in training. He is very technical, he enjoys the game and he is a fantastic player."</p>

      <h3>Who is the kitman's worst nightmare?</h3>
      <p>"We have water outside so when you finish training you can wash your shoes but I have never seen <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jonjo-shelvey">Jonjo</a> [Shelvey] wash his shoes."</p>
      <h3>Who picks up the most fines?</h3>
      <p>"Allan. He is late in training, also in meetings. But he is a great lad. It was his first time with us but now he is getting better with it."</p>
