      <p>Kumasi, Nov. 20, GNA – Mr Eric Atta-Sonno, President of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) Ghana, has said there is the need for the government to adequately resource Technical, Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions to enable them train more skilled manpower for the country’s industrial development.</p>
      <p>He said technical and vocational training are critical to achieving the country’s industrial development agenda, which was anchored in the ‘One District, One Factory’ policy and other development initiatives being implemented by the government to promote development.</p>
      <p>Mr Atta-Sonno said this at the 33rd annual general meeting of IET Ghana, in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>It was under the theme: “TVET-the industrial backbone to the economy”.   </p>
      <p>The purpose of technical and vocational education is to equip young people with the technical, vocational and professional skills needed for socio-economic development of the country, he said.</p>
      <p>He said the emphasis is not only to provide middle level technical expertise for industries, but also provide employable skills that would help reduce unemployment among the youth.</p>
      <p>Mr Atta-Sonno commended the government for identifying TVET as one of the priority areas to reduce poverty in the country and thereby placing emphasis on the need to get more young people trained to acquire useful skills.</p>
