      <p>Baby grey seals have arrived in Lincolnshire as the pupping season begins along the coast.</p>
      <p>The baby seals were born at Donna Nook National Nature Reserve, where the species comes every year in late October, November and December to give birth.</p>
      <p>According to the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust (LWT), the first grey seal pup of the season was born on October 27, and was spotted tucked into its mother by a warden.</p>
      <p>The LWT said around 40% of the world population of grey seals can be found in Britain.</p>
