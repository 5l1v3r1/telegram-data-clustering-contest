      <p><i>Emma</i>, the beloved Jane Austen social satire, gets a new adaptation from photographer Autumn de Wilde.</p>
      <p>Jane Austen’s comedy follows the well-intentioned, yet spoiled and headstrong Emma, who enjoys playing matchmaker and sticking her nose in other people’s business. On writing the book, Austen had stated, “I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.” Throughout the novel, Emma tries to pair up her new friend Harriet, who comes from a lesser social standing, with various eligible bachelors in their small community. Other iconic characters include Emma’s hypochondriac father, the nosy Miss Bates, and Mr. Knightley, Emma’s brother-in-law and the only person who ever calls her out.</p>
      <p>Previous adaptations include a 1996 movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow; <i>Clueless, </i>which transplanted the story to 1995 Beverly Hills; various BBC miniseries; and <i>Emma Approved</i>, a web series adaptation from the creators of <i>The Lizzie Bennet Diaries.</i></p>
      <p>This new version stars Anya Taylor-Joy (<i>The Witch</i>) as Emma, with South African musician Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley and Bill Nighy (<i>Love Actually</i>) as Emma’s father. In addition to highlighting the sweeping Regency era aesthetic, the trailer has a section of people saying Emma’s name out loud in various degrees of exasperation, which absolutely tracks.</p>
      <p><i>Emma </i>comes out Feb. 21, 2020.</p>
