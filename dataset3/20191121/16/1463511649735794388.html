      <h1>Lawmakers determined to prevent Donkey extinction in Nigeria</h1>

      <p>The House of Representatives is determined to prevent donkeys from going into extinction in the country.</p>
      <p>Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, made the pledge at the launch of a world report on donkeys organised by the Donkey Sanctuary, a UK based organisation on Thursday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The speaker, represented by the Chief Whip of the House, Hon. Mohammed Mongonu, appreciated Donkey Sanctuary for choosing Nigeria to launch the report.</p>
      <p>He said that it showed the commitment of the organisation to the survival of donkeys in the country.</p>
      <p>The parliamentarian said that the green chambers had taken cognisance of the indiscriminate killing of donkeys and exportation of its body parts.</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila said that the House had passed a bill to prohibit the act with a jail term of about 10 years to serve as deterrent.</p>
      <p>According to him, the penalty will save the donkeys from going into extinction in the country because of its socioeconomic importance.</p>
      <p>The speaker said that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria empowered the House to pass laws to either prohibit or encourage importation or exportation of commodities.</p>
      <p>Gbajabiamila said that some members of the House were members of the ECOWAS parliament and that they would be sensitised to make it a regional law.</p>
      <p>He said: “We will do all it takes to make sure donkeys do not go into extinction in Nigeria because of its sociocultural importance.</p>
      <p>“The House will study the report and adopt key recommendations for implementation,” Gbajabiamila said.</p>
      <p>In his remarks, the sponsor of the bill, Hon. Garba Datti said that the House was the voice of the voiceless including the donkeys.</p>
      <p>Datti said that when he moved the motion, he knew little or nothing about the activities of the Donkey Sanctuary.</p>
      <p>He said he moved the motion by the poor handling of the animal of burden saying that he was an accident animal freedom fighter.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker said that clauses one and two of the bill prohibited the killing of donkeys, purchase and exportation of its body parts.</p>
      <p>Datti said that clause four of the bill proposed 10 year jail term for offenders and where cooperate organisation or association was guilty, the Chief Executive would be held liable.</p>
      <p>The legislator explained that the bill will be transmitted to the Senate for concurrence and then be forwarded to the President for assent.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the Chief Executives Officer of Donkey Sanctuary, Mike Baker, said that the world was faced with a crisis according to an independent research; 4.8 million donkeys skin are exported to China every year.</p>
      <p>According to Baker, within five years, that will require over half of the world’s population of donkeys.</p>
      <p>He said that the current rate could lead to making donkeys a thing of the past in few years to come.</p>
      <p>Baker said if that happen, it could lead to hardship and increased labour in areas where donkeys are used to carry goods and services.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the report, Baker said that it contained the horrific details of donkeys and their welfare.</p>
      <p>Baker said that in some cases many Donkey die while being transported in overcrowded Lorries and the survivals got various degrees of injuries.</p>
      <p>He said that they were held in pens without food or water, saying that it was cheaper when the animal dies in that situation than in slaughter house.</p>
      <p>Baker said that the choice for Nigeria to host the launch was because the country was leading the way against the trade of donkeys.</p>
      <p>He said that was also based on the fact that the country had suffered from the spread of diseases.</p>
