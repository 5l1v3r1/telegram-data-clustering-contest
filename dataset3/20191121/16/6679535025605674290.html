      <p>The Indian women’s cricket team completed a 5-0 series whitewash over the West Indies after half-centuries from Veda Krishnamurthy and Jemimah Rodrigues, complemented by the bowlers’ clinical show, steered the side to a 61-run triumph in the fifth and final T20 International here.</p>
      <p>Jemimah (50) and Veda (57 not out) shared 117 runs for the third wicket as India Women scored 134 for three after electing to bat.</p>
      <p>India was reduced to 17 for two in the fourth over with Shafali Verma (9) and captain Smriti Mandhana (7) getting out cheaply. But the Jemimah-Veda duo steadied the innings and took the side to a decent total.</p>
      <p>Jemimah needed 56 balls for her 50, which was studded with three boundaries, while Veda’s unbeaten 57 came off 48 deliveries, which included four hits to the fence.</p>
      <p>In the West Indies run chase, the Indian bowlers produced a disciplined performance to restrict the host to 73 for seven.</p>
      <p><b>The scores</b>: India Women 134/3 in 20 overs (Jemimah Rodrigues 50, Veda Krishnamurthy 57 n.o.) bt West Indies Women 73/7 in 20 overs (Anuja Patil 2/3). <b>Player-of-the-Match</b>: Veda Krishnamurthy; <b>Player-of-the-Series</b>: Sushma Verma.</p>
