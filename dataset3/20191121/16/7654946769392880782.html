      <h1>Coldplay postpones new album tour over carbon footprint concerns</h1>

      <p>Fans know Coldplay for their song “Yellow,” but the band prefers to be associated with “green.”</p>
      <p>The multi-platinum rock band has announced that it’s postponing shows to promote their new album “Everyday Life,” which drops Friday, until they find a way to make them “actively beneficial” for the environment.</p>
      <p>“Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally,” said frontman Chris Martin, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">telling BBC News</a> that the band was pausing a tour tied to the album while they develop a carbon neutral production.</p>
      <p>“We would be disappointed if it’s not carbon neutral,” Martin said. “We’ve done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it’s not so much taking as giving?”</p>
      <p>Coldplay marks the latest in a trend of entertainers pledging to be more eco-conscious.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/grammy-nominations-2020-complete-list-of-nominees/">Grammy nominee</a> Billie Eilish recently <a href="https://youtu.be/hzmbCSHcSts">told Jimmy Fallon</a> in September that she was working to make her world tour “as green as possible.”</p>

      <p>She plans to ban plastic straws, encourage refillable water bottles and recycling at the venue. Her shows will also feature the educational “Billie Eilish Eco-Village,” where fans can learn more about climate change and eco-activism — and get a chance to win free tickets to coveted shows.</p>
      <p>The band 1975 recently released a single <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/29/teen-activist-bringing-climate-change-message-to-america/">featuring climate activist Greta Thunberg</a> as a call to action to pop audiences. The group also promised to make their shows more carbon efficient, and also <a href="https://twitter.com/jamieoborne/status/1172437099498180608">plans to plant one tree for every ticket sold</a> during their 2020 UK tour. Declaring band tour tees “unsustainable,” the group will also <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1Rm2qXB89l/">rehash unsold merch</a> from past tours and print new graphics right on top of the old — with varying avant garde affects.</p>
      <p>The weight of responsibility is heavy on some entertainers, whose careers leave a disproportionately sized carbon footprint.</p>
      <p>Thom Yorke recently <a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/09/22/radioheads-thom-yorke-admits-hes-a-climate-change-hypocrite/?_ga=2.167523070.1333654863.1574174573-801982646.1570712636">admitted to BBC radio listeners</a> that’s he’s a climate “hypocrite.”</p>
      <p>“The thing I’ve always struggled somewhat with is that if I’m campaigning on climate change, I’m someone who has to fly for my work, so, boom, I’m a hypocrite,” said the Radiohead frontman and Friends of the Earth activist.</p>
      <p>He continued, “I totally agree I’m a hypocrite, but I’m trying to do something about it, and yes, you’re right, I’m a hypocrite.”</p>
      <p>However, Yorke added that “the real stuff has to happen in Parliament and the UN, and has to happen now, we’re out of time.”</p>
