      <h1>Meet the four India-origin ministers in Justin Trudeau’s Cabinet</h1>

      <p>On Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau unveiled his new cabinet in which four of the 36 ministers are of Indian origin.</p>
      <p>Three Indian origin members who served in Trudeau’s previous cabinet have again been made ministers– Harjit Sajjan, Navdeep Bains, and Bardish Chagger. Amarjeet Sohi, who previously held the Infrastructure and Natural Resources ministries, lost re-election in the 2019 polls.</p>
      <p>The new Indian-origin face in the cabinet is Anita Anand, the first Hindu to occupy a ministerial berth in Canada.</p>
      <p>In the October general elections, 20 Indian-origin candidates became parliamentarians. Trudeau’s Liberal party lost its majority in the bitterly fought polls, but managed to remain in power.</p>
      <h3>Who are the four Indian origin ministers in Trudeau’s cabinet?</h3>
      <h3>Harjit Sajjan, Minister of National Defence</h3>

      <p>Sajjan is Member of Parliament from Vancouver South in British Columbia, a constituency he won for the second time in the 2019 elections. He held the Defence portfolio for the entirety of the first cabinet, and continues to hold the position.</p>
      <p>Sajjan was born in Bombeli in Punjab’s Hoshiarpur district, and was a five-year-old when he came to Vancouver with his older sister and mother in 1976. His father, Kundan Singh, had been a police officer in India who immigrated to Vancouver.</p>
      <p>Prior to entering politics, Sajjan has had a decorated career as a police officer and as a combat veteran. He was a member of the Vancouver Police Department for 11 years, based primarily in South Vancouver, where he completed his career as a detective with the gang crime unit. He took a break from the Police service to join the British Columbia Regiment of the Canadian Army in 1989 as a trooper and from there, rose to the position of Lieutenant-Colonel.</p>
      <p>As a reserve Lieutenant-Colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces and a member of the British Columbia Regiment, he participated in four operational deployments – one to Bosnia-Herzegovina and three in Kandahar, Afghanistan. In September 2011, he also became the first Sikh to command any Canadian Army regiment – his British Columbia Regiment. For his service, he has received glowing praise and awarded several military honours by the Canadian government, including the Meritorious Service Medal in 2013 for reducing the Taliban’s influence in the Kandahar province of Afghanistan, and the Order of Military Merit in 2014.</p>
      <p>In the 2015 general elections, his nomination had been backed by prominent Sikh leaders of the World Sikh Organization (WSO), which led a large number of Punjabi-Sikh Liberals (nearly 4000) from British Columbia to quit the party in protest. The resigning contingent had alleged that the Liberal Party was being “hijacked” and Trudeau “manipulated” by fundamentalist Sikhs under the banner of the WSO.</p>
      <p>During his visit to India as Defence Minister in 2017, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh accused Sajjan of being a “Khalistan supporter” and refused to meet him. The Canadian High Commission termed Amarinder’s remarks “disappointing and inaccurate”. Sajjan has said in a statement to the Vancouver Sun, “I don’t support the breakup of any country. I’m a Canadian. I want to focus on Canadian issues”.</p>

      <p>In May 2018, Bains made headlines when he was asked to take off his turban at an airport in the US during a security check, prompting senior US officials to apologise.</p>
