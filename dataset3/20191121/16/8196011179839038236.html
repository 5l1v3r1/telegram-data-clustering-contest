      <p>Gardaí have announced that they are investigating "potential breaches of Immigration Legislation" after 16 people were found aboard a ferry which has arrived in Rosslare.</p>
      <p>At a media briefing this evening, Supt Jim Doyle told reporters that it is fortunate that officers were not dealing with a tragedy, as he confirmed that 16 men of Middle Eastern origin are now being processed under immigration law. Gardaí believe that all the men are adults, but have yet to confirm the age of one man who may be a juvenile.</p>
      <p>Gardaí believe the 16 men found in the back of a lorry on a ferry to Rosslare were in the container for between 10 and 12 hours.</p>
      <p>“This has been a traumatic time for them and they are being treated with compassion,” Supt Doyle told the media.</p>
      <p>“It is very fortunate that they were found and they were found alive and in good spirits.</p>
      <p>“At some point later tonight they will be taken to a reception area to get care in terms of accommodation and food,” Supt Doyle said.</p>
      <p>He said the lorry the men were found in belongs to an Irish company and the owner and the driver are Irish. The owners and the driver, a male in his 50s and a resident of Ireland for over 25 years, are co-operating fully with the ongoing investigation.</p>

      <p>The Captain of the ferry alerted Gardaí just before 10am today that a number of people had been discovered in the trailer of an articulated tractor unit on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>A Garda statement has said that "all the individuals appear to be in good health" and are receiving medical assessment upon their arrival at Rosslare Port.</p>
      <p>Garda Immigration Officers attached to Wexford Garda Station, supported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, will also carry out an assessment on the immigration status of the 16 people found.</p>
      <p>Ian Hampton, Stena Line’s chief people and communications officer, confirmed an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection shortly before 10am on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He said: “During the Stena Horizon’s 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>“All the individuals are reported to be in good health and have been moved to a private passenger lounge on the ship where their wellbeing is the focus of our employees.”</p>
      <p>The incident comes just days after a group of 25 people were found inside a refrigerated container on board a UK-bound ship just off the coast of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Last month, 39 people were found dead inside a container in Essex which had arrived in the UK via a ferry from Zeebrugge, Belgium.</p>
      <blockquote>Recent events show unfortunately Ireland is playing a significant part in this crime. These traffickers have to be thoroughly policed so vulnerable people are protected</blockquote>
      <p>Leo Varadkar told RTE: “Of course our initial response will be a humanitarian one, to make sure those people are well and that their health is good.</p>
      <p>“After that of course there will need to be a response that involves the gardai, because as you know human trafficking is illegal, and we’ll need to see what happens with the people who come ashore.”</p>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan has released a statement saying: “I was extremely concerned to learn of another incident of people being found in a sealed lorry container, on this occasion on board a ferry.</p>
      <p>“There is an active Garda investigation underway and I would appeal to anyone with any information on these nefarious activities to come forward. I welcome the statement issued by An Garda Síochána earlier today.</p>
      <p>“The persons found in the lorry container are now being cared for by State services. As part of that care, they will receive initial medical assessments.”</p>
      <p>Fianna Fail’s spokesman on justice Jim O’Callaghan expressed his shock and demanded a full investigation into the incident.</p>
      <p>“A full investigation must be launched into the discovery of up to 16 people being transported in the back of a lorry to Ireland,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Human trafficking is a modern form of slavery and needs to be tackled with fully resourced policing.</p>
      <p>“Recent events show unfortunately Ireland is playing a significant part in this crime. These traffickers have to be thoroughly policed so vulnerable people are protected.”</p>

      <p>Ambulances have entered a ferry carrying 16 people discovered in a sealed trailer.</p>
      <p>The Stena Line ferry arrived in Rosslare in Co Wexford in the Irish Republic at around 3pm on Thursday from Cherbourg in France.</p>
      <p>All those found by an employee were in good health and have been moved to a passenger lounge, the ferry company said.</p>
      <p>Two ambulances and several doctors’ cars and police cars drove onto the ship’s vehicle deck shortly after it docked in south-east Ireland.</p>
      <p>A large police and Immigration Bureau presence was visible around the port.</p>
      <p>Ian Hampton, Stena Line’s chief people and communications officer, confirmed an employee discovered the people during a routine inspection, reportedly after banging was heard on the side of the trailer shortly before 10am on Thursday.</p>
      <blockquote>Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel's arrival in Rosslare</blockquote>
      <p>He said: “During the Stena Horizon’s 9pm sailing from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday November 20, one of our employees during a routine inspection discovered 16 people in a sealed trailer on the vehicle deck.</p>

      <p>“Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel’s arrival in Rosslare.”</p>
      <p>Officers are expected to carry out assessments and searches of the container.</p>
      <p>A source inside the Irish Government told the PA news agency that officials in the Justice Department were only made aware of the incident after media reports.</p>
      <p>Opposition party Fianna Fail’s spokesman on justice Jim O’Callaghan expressed his shock and demanded a full investigation into the incident.</p>
