      <h3>Changes are Coming to Escalation Mode in Gears 5</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 21 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>The Coalition has announced it will be making changes to the Escalation multiplayer mode in <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Gears-5/achievements">Gears 5</a> based on player feedback in a bid to make the game mode more exciting for both viewers and players.</p>

      <p>In an update that rolls out today, changes will be made to both the length of matches and the placement of power weapons on home hills. Rounds to win the game, initial lives and max lives will all be reduced. Respawn duration is also being reduced along with Disable duration. According to The Coalition, these changes are to make Escalation more thrilling and engaging to both watch and play.</p>
      <p>The following changes will come in an update today at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rounds To Win: 5 (was 7)</li>
        <li>Initial Lives: 4 (was 5)</li>
        <li>Max Lives: 4 (was 5)</li>
        <li>Respawn Duration Reduction Per Round: -2 Seconds (was -1)</li>
        <li>Disable Duration: 1 Round (was 3)</li>
        <li>Secondary Weapon Placements: Boomshot and Dropshot can no longer be placed on secondary (home) weapon slots</li>
      </ul>
      <p>"We expect these changes to improve the depth of weapon choices and reduce the length of the game to a more suitable experience."</p>
      <p>These changes will apply to both Ranked and to competitive Gears Esports. The Coalition has also acknowledged that the timing of the changes for Esports competitors is not the best, "we acknowledge the timing of this change and we would like to assure everyone that this decision was not taken lightly. Ultimately, our commitment is to support the immediate and long-term health of Gears Esports, and we believe that providing the best player and viewer experience possible is crucial to our success as we head into the first major event in San Diego."</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, Gears 5 is also getting a <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39781/gears-5-boost-bonus-weekend-horde">double XP weekend for Horde characters</a> including three days of free Boost, if you log in on certain days. This should help you make a dent in some of the game's more grind-heavy achievements like <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a282057/whos-your-horde-main-achievement">Who's Your Horde Main?</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a282055/compulsive-horder-achievement">Compulsive Horder</a>, and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a282023/seriously-50--chapter-1-achievement">Seriously 5.0 - Chapter 1</a>.</p>
