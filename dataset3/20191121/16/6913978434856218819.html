      <p><b>LOS ANGELES —</b> "Frozen" actress Kristen Bell was honored on Tuesday with a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame, joking that a mugger would soon demand a woman's purse on the same spot with the words "Let it go!"<br/><br/>Bell, who came to fame on TV teen detective show "Veronica Mars" and appears in NBC's "The Good Place," unveiled her new star alongside fellow honoree Idina Menzel.<br/><br/>The pair reprise their roles as Anna and Elsa in "Frozen 2," the sequel to Disney's animated smash hit out this Friday.<br/><br/>"I am so grateful to be accepting this honor today on these hallowed streets where 'Pretty Woman' sold her body for money — it's really a dream," joked Bell.<br/><br/>The ceremony took place toward the eastern end of the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.<br/><br/>"The Good Place" creator Michael Schur described the location as "the most glamorous location in all of show business — the semi-abandoned Starline Tours branch office."<br/><br/>The ceremony was attended by Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti and Walt Disney Studios co-chairman Alan Horn.<br/><br/>"As wonderful as this recognition feels in the moment, I know that it's only temporary," said Bell.<br/><br/>She added: "This star will really only know its true value when inevitably, someone is mugged in that very spot, and as they clutch their purse, the assailant screams, 'Let it go!'"<br/><br/>"And the victim will look up and say, 'That's not even her song, you son of a bitch.'"<br/><br/>"Let It Go," the Oscar-winning showstopper of the first "Frozen" movie, was sung by Menzel.<br/><br/>Bell also paid tribute to Menzel, who has an enlarged role in the sequel.<br/><br/>"I'm not going to say it's better than the first because all the music is good," she said. "But I will tell you they did the smartest thing with the second movie because they decided, rightfully so, to double down on Idina.<br/><br/>"'Let It Go' was such a hit, and the geniuses at Disney were like 'What if we just gave her two songs? Wouldn't that be like twice as good?' And guess what — it is," Bell added. — AFP</p>
