      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Coldplay frontman <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Chris_Martin/?tps=1">Chris Martin</a> announced the band will not be touring in support of their new album <i>Everyday Life</i>, citing how tours impact the environment.</p>
      <p>"We're taking time over the next year or two, to work out how our tour can not only be sustainable [but] how can it be actively beneficial," Martin told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-50490700">BBC News</a> on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Coldplay will instead be holding two concerts in Jordan starting Friday with the shows being made available on YouTube.</p>
      <p>The band last toured in 2016 and 2017 in support of their album <i>A Head Full of Dreams</i>.</p>
      <p>"Our next tour will be the best possible version of a tour like that environmentally," Martin said. "We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral."</p>
      <p>Martin also expressed wanting to have concerts that have no single use plastic and is mainly solar powered.</p>
      <p><i>Everyday Life</i> will include <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/10/25/Coldplay-performs-in-public-spaces-in-Orphans-music-video/8631572017926/">the singles</a> "Daddy" and "Orphans."</p>
      <p>Coldplay released on Wednesday an <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/Music/2019/11/20/Coldplay-uses-animation-puppets-in-new-Daddy-music-video/4781574271730/">animated music video</a> for "Daddy" that used 2D animation and puppets.</p>
