      <h1>Some Google Stadia users report overheating and shutdowns when streaming with Chromecast Ultra</h1>
      <h2>This could especially prove to be a problem in multiplayer games like Destiny 2</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:44:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/bradly-shankar" target="_blank">Bradly Shankar</a></address>
      <p>Several <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/18/google-stadia-review/">Google Stadia</a> users are reporting that streaming games to their Chromecast Ultras is actually causing the dongles to overheat and even shut down entirely.</p>
      <p>In a thread on the Stadia subreddit, user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/armadeon7479/">u/armadeon7479</a> said he was in the middle of a shootout in <i>Destiny 2 </i>when his Chromecast Ultra suddenly disconnected and his game session ended. According to the user, the Chromecast was “extremely hot” when he went to unplug it. This was after about four hours of playtime, he said.</p>
      <p>Another user, ‘<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/duhbyo/">duhbyo</a>,’ added that his Chromecast Ultra also overheated and shut down twice. Other users mentioned Chromecast overheating, although they didn’t clarify if this was accompanied by shutdowns.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that several of the users mentioned that Chromecast overheating is a common occurrence for them when streaming movies or TV shows. However, none of them mentioned that their Chromecasts ever crashed during media playback.</p>
      <p>Either way, picking up where you left off in a movie or TV is a relatively painless endeavour. However, a sudden shutdown in a game like <i>Destiny 2 </i>where you’re often in a lengthy raid with friends can be especially frustrating.</p>
      <p>It’s worth noting that my Chromecast Ultra didn’t overheat or crash as I streamed games with it to prepare for <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/18/google-stadia-review/">my Stadia review</a>. However, I was also balancing my time between streaming to Chromecast Ultra, Google Pixel 3a and Chrome browsers, so I didn’t spend too much time on any one device.</p>
      <p>When reached for comment, Google sent the following statement to <i>MobileSyrup</i>:</p>
      <p><i>“We can confirm there is no thermal overheating issue with Chromecast Ultra. Since launching more than three years ago, Chromecast Ultra has been enjoyed by millions of users worldwide. During normal usage, the surface of the device may get warm to the touch. This is working as designed. <br/></i><i>Using your Chromecast Ultra to stream Stadia games is very similar to using it to stream TV shows and movies. We carry out extensive testing on hardware, services and games—including tests of long Stadia play and video sessions—and have not seen thermal shutdown problems.  We will happily work with users to understand their particular experience better.”<br/></i><b>Update 21/11/2019 —</b> Story has been updated with comment from Google.</p>
