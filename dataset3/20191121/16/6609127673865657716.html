      <p>And the biscuit king has vowed to send down a batch from Tunnock’s HQ in Uddingston, Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>He received his honour on Thursday for services to business and charity.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, he said: “She said she prefers the teacakes and I said I’ll send her some over.”</p>
      <p>Sir Boyd created the Tunnock’s Teacake - marshmallow on a biscuit base coated in chocolate - in 1956.</p>
      <p>The caramel wafer, made up of five layers of wafer, four layers of caramel and fully coated in chocolate, was created by Sir Boyd’s father Archie in 1952.</p>
      <p>Sir Boyd joked: “I prefer the Caramel Wafers but only because we make more money from them.”</p>
      <p>Describing the investiture ceremony, Sir Boyd said it was “excellent” and “awesome” to receive his honour from the Queen.</p>
      <p>He said: “It was very regal."</p>
      <p>“The music was great, I was standing there swaying and I could have danced all night.</p>
      <p>“The Queen is so nice and makes you feel very relaxed.”</p>
      <p>Sir Boyd previously told how he carries supplies of Teacakes wherever he goes.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Scottish Sun in August, he said: “A Teacake you can eat any time.</p>
      <p>“If we are going away I always take a six-pack with me.</p>
      <p>"Invariably I will wake up through the night, eat a Teacake in the dark and go back to sleep — or wake up first thing and have one in the morning with a cup of tea.”</p>
