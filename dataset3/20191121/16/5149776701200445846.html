      <h3>How is life treating you at this moment in time?</h3>
      <p>What can I say; life at the minute is wonderful man. So far it has been a full-on, crazy, busy year for Halestorm, in fact it must be coming up to a year and a half now. We have just been going and going.</p>
      <h3>These are your biggest shows in the UK so far but why only four dates?</h3>
      <p>What can I say but yes, that really is frustrating for both the fans and the band, and we are truly sorry that we cannot fit any more shows into the UK schedule this time around. As soon as we finish the UK leg we will be jumping onto a plane and heading off to Sweden, Japan, Australia and Malaysia.</p>

      <h3>It’s a hard life.</h3>
      <p>(Laughs) You know, it’s tiring but you don’t realise just how tired you are until you get home and sleep in your own bed. Up until that point it is a total blast but man, you do enjoy sleeping in your own bed.</p>
      <h3>Do you enjoy the UK?</h3>
      <p>I totally love the UK. Ever since we first started going over there, we have always felt that there was an instant connection with the fans and that has never gone away. None of us could have ever expected such a quick rise in popularity. I think that it took half the time there in the UK as it did for us here in the USA. The UK really are diehard rock fans. We love you guys.</p>

      <h3>What can fans expect at the Nottingham show?</h3>
      <p>A great evening and a fantastic show. We have very special guests In This Moment, together with New Years Day, and they are truly awesome. So I would expect a fun night of rock with three truly different approaches to rock music.</p>
      <h3>Are there any thoughts on a new studio album?</h3>
      <p>We are going to start digging into that early next year, after this tour is finally over. Our direction early next year is to start writing and working on a new studio album. We have already been compiling ideas so what can I say; studio time is just around the corner.</p>

      <h3>You play hundreds of shows each year. Do you not have a fear of burning out?</h3>
      <p>No, not at all, we just keep on doing it because it is what we know. I also think that as we have gotten older, we tour a bit smarter now. We try not to play so many shows in a row. We are all up there giving it everything every night, but we all have to be mindful of Lzzy’s voice and the preservation of it. It’s nice to get home but that burn to get back out on the road is always just around the corner.</p>
      <p>I have a baby boy now and that makes it hard for me to leave home, but it’s the life. Hopefully he will come out on the road with me from time to time and that will make my life a little easier.</p>
      <h3>How will you be spending Christmas?</h3>
      <p>I moved to Nashville three years ago now, and every year we go to Philadelphia, to spend Christmas with my family. We have travelled so much this year that my wife and I have decided that we are staying at home.</p>
