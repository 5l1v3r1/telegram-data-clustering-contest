      <p>Ukrainian agrarians threshed 73 million tonnes of grains and leguminous crops from 14.9 million hectares (ha) as of November 20, 2019, which was 98% of the target forecast.</p>
      <p>In particular, 33 million tonnes of maize was threshed from 4.7 million ha (94% of the target); 89,000 tonnes of buckwheat from 67,000 ha (99% of the target); and 159,000 tonnes of millet from 88,000 ha (98% of the target), according to the Department of Ukraine's Economic Development, Trade and Agriculture Ministry.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian farmers also threshed 14.5 million tonnes of sunflower seeds from 5.8 million ha (99% of the target) and 3.7 million tonnes of soybeans from 1.6 million ha (99%).</p>
      <p>The yield of <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10721841-ukraine-produces-almost-497-000-tonnes-of-sugar-since-aug-30.html">sugar beets</a> was 9.5 million tonnes from 214,000 ha (97% of the target).</p>
      <p>The sowing campaign is underway simultaneously with harvesting, the ministry said. As of November 20, winter grain crops were sown on 6.9 million ha, or 96% of the plan.</p>
      <p>In particular, winter wheat was sown on 5.9 million ha, or 95% of the forecast, rye on 123,000 ha (the target fulfilled), and winter barley on 916,000 ha (the target fulfilled).</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, Ukrainian agrarians are expected to harvest 74 million tonnes of grain in 2019, according to the Ukrainian economy ministry's preliminary estimates.</p>
      <p>The country's grain harvest in 2018 was 70.1 million tonnes, which was a record high yield.</p>
