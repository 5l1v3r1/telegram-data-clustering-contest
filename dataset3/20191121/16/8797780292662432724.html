      <p>Being an influencer can be hard work and those people actively trying to promote and keep their Twitter follower-base happy certainly have their work cut out for them as they need to constantly tweet on a regular basis to keep up their presence. No rest for the wicked they say.</p>
      <p>A new feature coming to the Twitter web app though could be making things a lot easier for those that want to ensure their Tweets are regularly coming without needing to actually be online at the same time. Twitter announced that they are experimenting with bringing one ofTweetdeck’s best features, the ability to schedule tweets, directly to Twitter. Something which is particularly handy for big announcements or launches where timing is of the essence.</p>

      <p>It’s not clear exactly how Twitter is rolling out this experiment and whether it is region locked or which users they are rolling this out to but perhaps might be worthwhile checking your own Twitter profile and see if you’re one of the lucky ones that and now schedule their Tweets meaning you can finally get all of those toilet thoughts out of your head and scheduled throughout your day while you are on the toilet.</p>
      <p>I tried this out myself, but sadly I don’t have this capability from my web browser just yet so my 10 followers are going to have to be utterly disappointed when I still barely tweet. But that has nothing to do with this feature, I just don’t find expressing my many thoughts all over the world particularly appealing.</p>
