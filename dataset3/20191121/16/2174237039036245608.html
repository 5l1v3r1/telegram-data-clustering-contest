      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/godsticks-heavier-than-heaven">Godsticks</a> have announced details of their new studio album and released a video for the first single <i>Denigrate</i>, which features a guest appearance from <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/in-the-studio-with-tesseract">Tesseract</a> frontman <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/tesseracts-daniel-tompkins-reveals-new-solo-track-black-the-sun">Daniel Tompkins</a>.</p>
      <p>The follow-up to 2017’s <i>Faced With Rage</i> is titled <i>Inescapable</i> and it’ll arrive on February 7 through Kscope – and although not a concept album, it is said to shine “an inquisitive light on frontman Darran Charles’ struggle with inner demons which gave the songs a new level of intimacy.”</p>
      <p>Darran explains: “Lyrically, I’ve always shared personal thoughts, feelings and experiences but in a very ambiguous way. For <i>Inescapable</i> – in a conscious effort not to repeat ourselves – I thought I’d be a little more self-reflective and perhaps examine some of my inner demons.</p>
      <p>“I have a strange relationship with music, and especially playing guitar. I would struggle to survive without either, but equally they have made my life mentally torturous because my own self-worth is completely wrapped up in them. </p>
      <p>“I used to be very much a perfectionist in my early years, and while some people may wear that as a badge of honour, I eventually viewed it as huge heavy weight dragging down. It was a long time before I arrived at the realisation that perfection was impossible to achieve.”</p>
      <p>As for <i>Denigrate</i>, Tompkins was invited to contribute vocal harmonies, which is said to add “an extra layer of aggression and energy,” while the promo was directed by George Laycock of Blacktide Audio/Visual.</p>
      <p>Drummer Tom Price says: “Everyone in the band was so excited about the concept, but when we arrived on set and saw a large table full of cakes, sweets, chocolate, sugar, sprinkles, honey and all manners of confectionary, the magnitude of what we had all let ourselves in for finally dawned on us! </p>
      <p>“By the end of the shoot we were completely covered in everything – it was like The Great British Bake Off meets Apocalypse Now! </p>
      <p>“It was so much fun to make, but despite several spins in the washing machine I still can‘t get that sweet sickly smell out of my jeans!”</p>
      <p>Godsticks have a handful of UK dates planned which will take place in April.</p>
