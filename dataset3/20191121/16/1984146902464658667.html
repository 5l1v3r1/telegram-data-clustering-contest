      <p>It's official! <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/greggs">Greggs</a> has been named as the North East's favourite place to eat.</p>
      <p>The North East bakery was a clear winner in a poll by YouGov that asked people about their dining habits.</p>
      <p>Brits were asked about their habits, preferences and choices when it came to those meals.</p>
      <p>Every region around the UK had varying choices, with burgers, pizza and even cookies the preferred food of choice.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/greggs">Greggs</a> hailing from the North East locals stayed true to form, as they did in to Cornwall where a pasty is the preferred takeaway - especially from West Cornwall Pasty Co.</p>

      <p>While the North East's favourite place to eat may not be a shock, north of the Border it was revealed Scots rate Chinese buffet Jimmy Chung's as the best eating place.</p>
      <p>In Yorkshire and the Humber, the burger chain MEATliquor comes top, while the North West is the only region with a sweet tooth as Millie's Cookies was named the region's favourite.</p>
      <p>Strada Restaurants was the favoured food spot in the East Midlands and Prezzo in the East of England.</p>
      <p>Heading south, outer Londoners favour Franco Manca, while inner Londoners prefer Wahaca - famous for its pork pibil tacos.</p>
      <p>Miller &amp; Carter Steakhouse was the top choice in both Wales and the West Midlands.</p>
