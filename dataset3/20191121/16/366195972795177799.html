      <p>It’s become all too familiar to see an artist defined by their debut album. Not even the Wu-Tang Clan are immune to such a fate. <i>Enter The Wu-Tang: 36 Chambers </i>has been hailed as a classic and rightfully so. Since its inception, the Clan has steadily cemented itself on both a unified and individual basis, having amassed a collective discography of iconic and timeless records throughout their storied run. On November 21st, 2000, nineteen years ago to this day, Wu-Tang dropped off their third studio album <i>The W. </i>A project that has, in the modern discourse, gone unsung for far too long.</p>
      <p>Lest we forget, <i>The W </i>marked the arrival of “Protect Ya Neck Part 2,” an updated take on one of hip-hop’s enduring tracks. And by some miracle the Clan delivered a sequel worthy of its predecessor, with the full Wu roster sliding effortlessly over a pair of distinctive RZAinstrumentals. Nevermore has their chemistry been more evident, with standout verses from Raekwon (“waves is spinning, blades is spinning” entrance is ridiculous), GZA, and U-God, who ushers in the sinister beat-switch with a badass flow. On that note, <i>The W </i>shines in its sonic aesthetic, boasting stripped-down and notably dark production. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/therza/profile">RZA</a> has never been one to shy away from the shadows, but here, he draws his blade and welcomes all supernatural challengers.</p>
      <p>“Careful (Click Click)” stands as a personal favorite, a chilling boom-bap masterpiece lined with violent lyricism. <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/GhostfaceKillah/profile">Ghostface Killah</a> slides through with the boxcutter, spitting abstract poetry the likes of which need close readings. “Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's Granddaddy Caddy was copped for 6 G's,” he spits, leaving listeners scrambling to infer meaning that’s just out of reach. “B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers, pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers.” Achieving title through a repeated hollow warning, “Careful” stands alongside some of Wu’s finest anthems. It also happens to one of their darker joints, which speaks to the project’s disavowal of then-modern production trends.</p>

      <p>Even when RZA pulls back the curtain and allows himself space to break immersion, the results thrive. “Gravel Pit,” which exploded onto BET screens as a Prehistoric visual, featured an uncommonly pristine instrumental from Bobby Digital. Not to mention an infectious hook, backed by a recurring chant from Tical in the backdrop, which grounds the track comfortably in the mainstream territory. And yet the Clan sacrifices none of their unique approach to lyricism, with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/MethodMan/profile">Method Man</a> setting things off with a stop-and-start flow. “From Park Hill to house on haunted hill, every time you walk by your back get a chill,” he spits. “Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills, I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill.”</p>
      <p>The album, which features strong appearances from some of the East Coasts finest in Nas, <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/BustaRhymes/profile">Busta Rhymes</a>, and <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/Redman/profile">Redman</a>, maintains a cohesive sound from start to finish. There’s plenty to unpack throughout the journey beyond the appeal of Wu-Tang members strictly bodying RZA’s production. “I Can’t Go To Sleep” finds Ghostface Killah unleashing a goosebumps-inducing performance, straining his voice to the point of tears as he openly wars with his PTSD. Redman and Method Man pick up where <i>Blackout </i>left off on “Redbull,” exchanging grimy verses of string-fueled tension. There’s even a verse from Ol’ Dirty Bastard, who links up with <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/SnoopDogg/profile">Snoop Dogg</a> on the charmingly demo-esque “Conditioner.”</p>
      <p>Nineteen years removed from its initial release, it's time to start giving <i>The W </i>the classic status it deserves. It's arguably Wu-Tang's darkest album, and for a project to retain an early-nineties ruggedness at the Platinum Era's onset is no easy feat. Take a moment to revisit The Wu-Tang's third endeavor, and if you have any fondness for it be sure to show some love in the comments below.</p>
