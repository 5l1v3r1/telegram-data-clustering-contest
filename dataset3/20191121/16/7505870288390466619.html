      <h1>It turns out that mysterious new Sony invention has nothing to do with the PS5</h1>

      <p>A few days ago, a Sony innovation was uncovered thanks to a patent filing that showed illustrations of a device that looked like a video game cartridge. At the time <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/11/ps5-release-date-still-far-away-sony-working-on-a-handheld-console/">we thought Sony might be working</a> on a second console, other than the highly anticipated PlayStation 5. In the days that followed, we saw speculation that said the cartridge might actually be a <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/12/ps5-price-vs-playstation-4-how-sony-might-keep-costs-down-at-launch/">modular SSD storage solution</a> that would help Sony keep the PS5’s price in check, and we explained <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/11/13/playstation-5-price-might-depend-on-a-sony-innovation-that-just-leaked/">why that might be a great idea</a>. It turns out the mysterious invention is indeed a storage cartridge, one that Sony briefly featured in a product video for a new device that you can’t even buy yet. But there’s a big twist: It’s not the PS5.</p>
      <p>The same Dutch blog that brought this Sony invention to our attention <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-cartridge-ps5-console/">obtained more information</a> about the product from an insider. <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-cartridge-ps5-console/"><i>LetsGoDigital</i></a> says the cartridge in question is indeed for storing content, but not for the PS5 — and it’s not the SSD cartridge that we thought it might be. Instead, the device packs content for a Sony TOIO gaming system for kids, one that’s not even really a console.</p>
      <p>As you’ll see in the video clip that was shared on YouTube around the time the Sony cartridge patent was uncovered, it’s a console that combines actual toys with an app for a gaming experience that kids and parents can enjoy together. The actual action happens in real life rather than on a screen, with kids being able to control certain toys that are connected to TOIO — like the cars in this video:</p>

      <p>Long story short, the cartridge didn’t turn out to be as exciting as we may have hoped. But hey, at least the first PS5-related patent that leaked earlier this year really did show us <a href="https://bgr.com/2019/10/21/ps5-release-date-new-render-based-on-playstation-5-dev-kit-photo-leak/">the design for Sony’s PS5 developer kit</a>.</p>
