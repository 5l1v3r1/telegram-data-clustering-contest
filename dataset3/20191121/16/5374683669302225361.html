      <p>Bar Ilan University President Professor Aryeh Zaban and University Rector Prof. Miriam Faust have decided not to file a complaint against Dr. Mordechai Kedar to the University's Disciplinary Committee over his statements that Yigal Amir was not the assassin who murdered former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.</p>
      <p>The decision was made following a meeting between Dr. Kedar and Prof. Zaban. Kedar was summoned to a disciplinary hearing where he presented his full position but did not retract his words.</p>
      <p>Following the meeting, it was decided that the objectives of the procedure were achieved and therefor</p>
      <p>"This is the disciplinary process," the university explained. "It was also decided to sharpen the procedures and guidelines regarding the performance of the University faculty members at public events."</p>
      <p>Speaking at a a <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270808">demonstration in Petah Tikva</a> last month, Kedar said that "Rabin’s murderer was a man with the initials Y.R. – not Yitzhak Rabin. Y.R. The person behind this was, apparently, a leading politician who wanted to eliminate Yitzhak Rabin because he wanted to ditch the Oslo Accords.”</p>
