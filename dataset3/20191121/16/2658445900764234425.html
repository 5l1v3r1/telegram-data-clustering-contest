      <p>The West African Examinations Council said that it has established an Electronic Certificate Management System that will enable candidates request for their certificates.</p>
      <p>WAEC noted that the online portal was for private candidates sitting for the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examination from September to November.</p>
      <p>The Nigeria National Committee Chairman (WAEC), Mrs Binta Abdulkadri, stated this in Abuja on Thursday at the 57th annual meeting of the council and presentation of awards to best performing candidates and schools.</p>
      <p>She said that WAEC has also deployed a “Quick Response Code on its certificates, thereby making it impossible to falsify certificates issued by the council.”</p>
      <p>The chairman said: “The Nigeria National Office, in particular, has taken advantage of Information and Communication Technology to improve its service delivery.</p>
      <p>“This development has enabled the council in Nigeria to achieve total migration from paper-based to electronic enrolment of candidates for its examinations.</p>
