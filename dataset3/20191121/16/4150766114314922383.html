      <h1>Koica planning to lend support in mine clearing</h1>

      <p>The Korea International Cooperation Agency (Koica) said on Wednesday it has embarked on a feasibility study – Project of Mine Action for Human Development Programme in Cambodia – to advance community development in villages that have been deemed mine-free.</p>
      <p>“Upon the key findings, the Koica Cambodia office will report to its headquarters to select the priority projects for implementation in 2021.</p>
      <p>“If this project passes selection, it will be implemented in Cambodia for 60 months from 2021 until 2025 with a total budget of $10 million,” Koica said.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, Ly Thuch, the senior minister in charge of Special Missions and secretary-general of CMAA, said the government welcomed Koica’s humanitarian aid and development efforts.</p>
      <p>Cambodia needs more funds to carry out mine and ordnance clearance activities across the country, Thuch said.</p>
      <p>“We will implement the work of mine clearance in three provinces along the border – Battambang, Pailin and Banteay Meanchey. [The three provinces] are considered to be having the most mines in Cambodia.</p>
      <p>“I hope that the Koica’s funds will help a large number of Cambodian people in these priority provinces,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said for over 20 years, the authority had successfully removed mines from 1,900sq km. At present, the mine authority still needed more funds to carry out anti-person or anti-tank mine clearance plans until its target completion in 2025.</p>
      <p>This year, more than 60 victims have been killed, injured, or disabled because of mines and ordnance explosion.</p>
