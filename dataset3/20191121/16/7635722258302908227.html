      <h1>Leinster championship scrapped in 2020 ladies football re-structure</h1>

        <b>There will be a full revamp of the structures for the 2020 TG4 All-Ireland Senior Ladies Football Championship, including the scrapping of the Leinster championship.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ladies Gaelic Football Association (LGFA) have confirmed the news today ahead of next year's campaign.</p>
      <p>The 2020 All-Ireland series will be consist of two groups, with six teams in each, and the top two teams from each group will progress to the All-Ireland semi-finals, following a minimum of five games.</p>
      <p>The Provincial Championships must be organised on a knock-out basis, with the winners seeded in the draw for the All-Ireland series.</p>
      <p>The bottom team in each group will contest a relegation play-off, unless they are a provincial winner, and thereby exempt from relegation.</p>
      <p>There will be no Senior Championship in Leinster for 2020, and the groups for the All-Ireland series will be decided at the LGFA’s next Central Council meeting and circulated thereafter.</p>

      <p>Last year, Dublin went on to beat Galway in front of a record 56,114 attendance in the 2019 TG4 All-Ireland Final, to land the Brendan Martin Cup for a third successive year.</p>
      <p>The Dubs were 2-3 to 0-4 winners in a fairly dour decider in poor conditions at Croke Park.</p>
      <p>Galway had beaten Connacht rivals Mayo by a point in the semi-final, while Dublin beat Ephie Fitzgerald's Cork team on a 2-11 to 0-11 scoreline in the second game of that double-header at GAA Headquarters.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the full fixture details <a href="https://www.offtheball.com/sport/ladies-football-national-league-fixtures-2020-released-927223">were released yesterday</a> for next year's Lidl Ladies National League, with reigning champions Cork taking on Westmeath at home in their opening game.</p>
      <p>Mick Bohan's Dublin side will host last year's All-Ireland intermediate champions Tipperary in their opening fixture when the league kicks-off on Sunday, January 26th.</p>
      <p>The LGFA also confirmed yesterday that the top two finishers in the league will progress straight to the Finals in each of the divisions.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Lidl Ladies National Football League Finals will be played on the weekend of April 18/19.</p>
