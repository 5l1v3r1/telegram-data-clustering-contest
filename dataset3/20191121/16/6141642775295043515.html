      <p>George Le Couteur was one of five men who escaped Jersey under the cover of darkness on 10 November 1944 on board a 15-foot boat they had acquired for the journey to liberated France.</p>
      <p>He died on Friday aged 96 and his funeral is due to take place at St Luke’s Church on 27 November at 1pm.</p>
      <p>In an interview with this newspaper in 2007, Mr Le Couteur used his diaries to retell the story of his escape, aged 21, alongside fellow Islanders Ken Parris (20), Michael Price (18), Eric Prain (19) and Francis Le Sueur (32).</p>
      <p>The group, who knew each other from Victoria College, had been planning to leave for months and agreed to take Mr Le Sueur with them after he escaped German custody on 25 October 1944 having already been caught trying to flee the Island.</p>
      <p>Thanks to much help from brave friends to get them to sea, and following a cold, damp and fraught night aboard the boat, they finally stepped ashore at Les Salines, west of Bricqueville Sur Mer, the next morning.</p>
      <p>They were welcomed ashore by a French family and within two weeks had made their way to Cherbourg, where they met fellow Jerseymen Roy Mourant, Peter Crill and John Floyd, who had escaped the night after them.</p>
      <p>Mr Le Couteur eventually made his way to England, where he joined the Royal Navy. After training as a stores rating at HMS Royal Arthur in Skegness he was drafted to HMS Pembroke Chatham barracks.</p>
      <p>On VE Day he was among the thousands outside Buckingham Palace calling for the King to come out and join the celebrations.</p>
