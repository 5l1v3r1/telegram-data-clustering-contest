      <p>After launching <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/03/sf-symbols-apple-design-resources/">SF Symbols with over 1,000 configurable options back in June at WWDC</a>, Apple expanded the set to over 1,500 symbols for developers at the end of October. In a developer post today, it highlighted the configurable symbol set.</p>
      <p>Apple the SF Symbols 1.1 update on October 29, but shared in a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=11212019a&amp;1574360881">developer post</a> today about it:</p>
      <blockquote>With the SF Symbols Mac app, you can view over 1,500 symbols available for use. Each symbol comes in a wide range of weights and scales, allowing you to easily design adaptable interfaces that look great. Symbols are easy to integrate into your app directly from within Xcode. And if you need a symbol that isn’t provided by SF Symbols, you can export template files to create your own with the same capabilities using a vector graphics editor. Version 1.1 adds custom symbol validation, a new sidebar with categories for faster browsing, and the option to receive updates automatically.</blockquote>
