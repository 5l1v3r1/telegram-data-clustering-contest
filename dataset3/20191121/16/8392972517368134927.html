      <p>Caitlyn Jenner is currently toughing it out in the Australian jungle, as one of the 12 famous faces taking part in this year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>

      <p>But former athlete and transgender activist Caitlyn, 70, has been hiding a dark tragedy from her fellow campmates.</p>
      <p>The reality star - who won Olympic gold at the 1500 metres as Bruce Jenner in 1976 - lost her brother in a tragic accident the same year she won gold in Montreal.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn, then Bruce, was 26 when her younger brother, Burt, died while driving a silver Porsche that Caitlyn had allowed him to borrow.</p>

      <p>After winning gold and breaking the world record at the Montreal Olympics, Caitlyn promptly retired and returned home to Canton, Connecticut, to give a speech at her former high school.</p>
      <p>A car dealership lent Caitlyn the sports car and she agreed to allow 18-year-old Burt and his high school sweetheart Judith Hutchings, 16, to drive it to the petrol station to fill up the tank.</p>
      <p>Mother of six Caitlyn - one of four siblings - revealed in her autobiography that Burt chose to take a "narrow and curvy" route.</p>

      <p>After losing control of the vehicle, Burt crashed and neither he nor Judith were wearing seatbelts.</p>
      <p>Paramedics fought to save them but Judith was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital and Burt died five hours later, without regaining consciousness.</p>
      <p>In her book The Secrets Of My Life, Caitlyn wrote: "There was a rise, and Burt took it too fast. The Porsche went airborne and then crooked.</p>
      <p>"It hit a tree and then a rock wall of sizeable boulders. Judith was flung from the car and killed instantly. Burt suffered critical injuries.</p>
      <p>"I have struggled with guilt."</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/caitlyn-jenners-motivation-win-im-20923940">The Mirror</a>, a friend of Caitlyn said: "Caitlyn has already had to deal with so much in her lifetime.</p>
      <p>"Losing her brother was a really painful time in her life but she got through it.</p>
      <p>"She is made of tough stuff and she's bringing that attitude to the jungle with her."</p>
      <p>After the first show, bookmakers slashed the odds on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/im-a-celebrity-fans-divided-over-caitlyn-and-kate-doing-the-bushtucker-trial/">Caitlyn</a> becoming the next Queen Of The Jungle, after she received a quarter of ALL bets.</p>
      <p>Many viewers perhaps expected the star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians to be a huge diva, but she seemed unfazed by jumping from a plane, the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tv/im-a-celebrity-fans-stunned-as-ian-wright-snaps-at-andrew-maxwell-over-dinner/">basic conditions in camp</a>, and lack of food.</p>
