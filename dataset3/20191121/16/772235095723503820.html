      <p>The cabin of the <b>Faraday Future FF91</b> crossover has been revealed at its hometown motor in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Billed as a "third internet living space" to sit between the home and work or learning environment, the FF91's interior is equipped with three 4G LTE modems â€” one for car diagnostics and software updates, and the other two for passenger connectivity.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/faraday-future/">Faraday Future</a> the multiple modem setup allows for video streaming to continue even in areas where mobile reception is weak.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/tag/faraday-future-ff91/">FF91</a> can be equipped with up to 11 screens, including a 11.6-inch wraparound instrumentation display, 10.1-inch rear view screen, and a 15.4-inch portrait-oriented touchscreen in the centre of the dashboard.</p>
      <p>There's also an ultra-wide 27.0-inch screen that drops down from the ceiling for the rear seat passengers, a large display ahead of the front seat passenger, and touchscreen units in each door controlling seat, climate control, audio, media and car settings.</p>
      <p>Every seat has a built-in array of sensors and facial recognition system, so settings can be set or tailored to each passenger's build and mood.</p>

      <p>There are still questions about whether the FF91 will ever make it into production.</p>
      <p>The company secured <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/752309/faraday-future-funding/">bridge funding</a> earlier this year to help pay off creditors and keep things moving along, and could begin building cars in China in the next few years, although no concrete details have been announced.</p>
      <p>The FF91 rides on a flexible EV architecture, and its all-wheel drive setup can be had with up to <b>783kW</b> of power for a 0-60mph <b>(0-97km/h)</b> time of <b>under three seconds.</b></p>
      <p>Fitted with a <b>130kWh</b> battery, the car is estimated to have a range of <b>608km</b> under the US EPA's testing regime.</p>
