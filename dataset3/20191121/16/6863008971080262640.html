      <p>Some UAH 1.63 billion, or US$67.4 million, in subsidies from the national budget was paid to Ukrainian households to compensate housing and utilities costs in January-October 2019, which was 30% up year-over-year (y-o-y).</p>
      <p>In particular, subsidies worth UAH 1.24 billion (US$51.3 million) were paid to residents in the urban areas, while UAH 416.8 million (US$17.2 million) was paid to rural residents, according to the Ukrainian State Statistics Service.</p>
      <p>Over the period under review, 2.573 million households applied for <a href="https://www.unian.info/economics/10559337-housing-utilities-subsidies-paid-to-households-in-ukraine-in-first-four-months-grow-by-37-5.html">subsidies</a> for housing and utilities, which was 41.8% down y-o-y, it said.</p>
      <p>Some 3.282 million families entitled to subsidies live in the urban areas, while 1.372 million households that received compensation for utilities reside in the rural areas. The number of families with assigned subsidies over the period under review increased by 20.4% y-o-y, the service reported.</p>
      <p>The average amount of subsidies assigned to one household in October 2019 grew by 8.7% y-o-y, to UAH 492.1, or about US$20.35.</p>
      <p>A total of 2.424 million households received subsidies in October alone.</p>
      <p>As UNIAN reported earlier, subsidies to reimburse housing and utilities costs in 2018 were estimated at UAH 2.7 billion (US$111.7 million), which was 33.4% down from 2017.</p>
