      <p>Being the perfect bride is not a day’s job, it involves a lot of effort and planning to get all right for the D-day. Apart from finalising the special trousseau, venue and decor decisions, there is one more important thing that needs to be sorted for the bride - her vanity suitcase. Vanity suitcase is more than just makeup, it is like that go-to bag which has all items to make the bride look beautiful, stay gorgeous, smell divine and has SOS items that she cannot leave stray anywhere else. Here is a checklist to keep you sorted girls!</p>
      <p>
        <b>Makeup</b>
      </p>
      <p>A vanity is primarily for keeping your makeup safe and in one place and it should be an important bag on your mind because this bag will be your rescue to those dark circles after hectic and sleepless nights or sudden guest visits in your new home. From concealer, foundation, blush, highlighter, setting powder, kajal, mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow palette, lipstick, lip balm to makeup remover, brushes, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/How-to-make-rose-water-at-home/articleshow/14024475.cms">rose water</a>, moisturiser and tissues, pack your vanity with every makeup item that makes you beautiful and confident.</p>
      <p><b>Mint</b> You may not realise but mint is an extremely important thing that should be available in abundance in your vanity. After long taxing hours of conversations at the wedding and even after that, people still would love to come close and talk to you and the least you should manage is a fresh breath. Bad breath can be bad news for a new bride.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Earbuds</b>
      </p>
      <p>These tiny sticks are important not only to check your ear hygiene but also sort a lot of other things. It can come handy in fixing a makeup error or a quick lipstick fix.</p>
      <p><b>Wet wipes<br/></b>Wet wipes are saviour when you have no time to freshen up or wash your face. These also come in handy if you have to tone down your makeup and not look horrifying as well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pins</b>
      </p>
      <p>Brides need pins, all kinds of pins. From all pins to bobby pins and safety pins, you need them all tucked in an immediately accessible pocket of your vanity bag. These tiny saviours are extremely important because we do not want you to suffer any malfunctions on your most special days.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hand cream and sanitizer</b>
      </p>
      <p>A hand cream is not only essential to keep your palm soft and hydrated but also because everytime you shake hands with people you meet, you don’t want your hands to pass on the smell of your henna to their hands or take weird sweat smells from their hands. Sanitizer comes to your rescue if you cannot leave the room instantly and yet need to freshen up your hands. Also, it keeps you away from all the unnecessary germs to make a new bride fall sick.</p>
