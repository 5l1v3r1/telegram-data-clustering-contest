      <p>The employee, no longer working for JDI, had defrauded approximately 578 million yen ($5.3 million) from the company between July 2014 and October 2018. The unnamed individual performed the fraud by arranging payments from JDI to a made-up company, with accounts they controlled. <br/><br/>While the firing was performed last year, a statement confirming the activity was only issued by JDI on Thursday, <i>Reuters</i> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-display-corruption/apple-supplier-japan-display-says-executive-embezzled-5-25-million-idUSKBN1XU2VY">reports</a>. JDI has also filed a criminal complaint against the person, and advised it is cooperating with police on the matter. <br/><br/>The revelation of fraud arrives at a crucial time for the company, as it continues to fight for financial survival. JDI is currently <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/26/apple-considering-a-further-bailout-of-japan-display-after-consortium-fails">negotiating a bailout deal</a> from Apple and other investors to rectify its accounts, one that is anticipated to be valued at around 50 billion yen ($460 million). <br/><br/>Apple has also offered assistance to JDI by shortening its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/23/apple-helping-out-lcd-supplier-japan-display-with-shorter-payment-terms">payment periods</a> for components, so Apple will make its payments for shipments quicker. The October announcement also involved other business partners relaxing their payment conditions, improving Japan Display's short-term financing situation by as much as $370 million. <br/><br/>Japan Display depends on Apple for approximately 60% of its revenue and is a producer of LCD screens for <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/iphone">iPhones</a>, but as Apple shifted towards OLED, the company was slow to react to the change, losing out to other display rivals in the process while it <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/02/apple-may-have-to-wait-two-years-for-oled-iphone-screens-from-japan-display">tries to catch up</a>.</p>
