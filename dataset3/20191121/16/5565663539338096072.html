      <p>A poisonous plant known as Cactus Rossia has ravaged some parts of Matabeleland South province killing livestock with calls being made for the local community to play a leading role to curb the menace.<br/><br/>The plant has remained a danger to communities in Gwanda South and Beitbridge with communities being urged not to wait for government officials and the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) to destroy it.<br/><br/>Speaking in Beitbridge west this Wednesday, the Area's legislator, Ruth Maboyi said communities must lead the fight against the plant of Polish origins before it spreads to other areas.<br/><br/>"We are the affected communities, we have to take lead in fighting this dangerous plant and it must start from our Chiefs and the entire traditional leadership to remove this plant and government officials are our technical partners, they help us but it's our duty to fight it," she said.<br/><br/>The plant which has sharp thorns that have killed a number of animals in Beitbridge was almost eradicated following the intervention of Parliament and EMA who availed resources and technical services to destroy it.<br/><br/>However, it has emerged that concerns have been raised in some parts of Beitbridge including Malala, Mtetengwe, Sihola, and Chamnangana, that it may soon multiply and become difficult to manage.</p>
