      <p>WATERBURY, Connecticut (WABC) -- Connecticut police say a body <a href="https://abc7ny.com/police-looking-for-missing-connecticut-bar-owner-find-body/5710322/">found in a wooded area of the state</a> is that of a missing bar owner from Waterbury who hadn't been seen in a week.</p>
      <p>Waterbury police say Janet Avalo-Alvarez's body was found in Wolcott on Tuesday, a few miles from where she was last seen.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old was last seen November 12 at La Guacara Taina, the Waterbury bar she co-owns with her boyfriend, Alfredo Esmerli Peguero-Gomez.</p>
      <p>Waterbury Lt. David Silverio said Avalo-Alvarez was identified through fingerprints and that the autopsy determined the manner of death to be neck compression.</p>
      <p>The case is being treated as a homicide.</p>
      <p>Police say Peguero-Gomez is considered a suspect, but they have not located him.</p>
      <p>His car was found at a New Jersey airport a couple of days after Avalo-Alvarez was last seen alive.</p>
      <p>He has dual citizenship in the Dominican Republic.</p>
