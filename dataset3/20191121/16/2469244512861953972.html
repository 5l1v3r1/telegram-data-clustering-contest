      <h2>The town won the South West in Bloom gold award for the second consecutive year</h2>

      <p>Tiverton has once again proven to be bloomin’ beautiful.</p>
      <p>The town won the South West in Bloom gold award for the second consecutive year.</p>
      <p>The aim for communities that take part each year is to improve and regenerate local environments, through the imaginative planting of trees, shrubs, flowers and landscaping, conservation and recycling projects, and to sweep away the eyesores that blight streets, such as litter, graffiti and vandalism.</p>
      <p>The results were announced to people in Tiverton at an In Bloom presentation evening.</p>
      <p>Councillor Wally Burke who is chairman of the Tiverton in Bloom committee on Tiverton Town Council said: “We are very pleased with the result we had this year. We have retained our gold, and it shows that we’re heading upwards and in the right direction.</p>
      <p>“Last year there was a bit of a hiccup, and they had to re-judge us when we won gold. This time we have easily retained gold, and the results of that encourage our townspeople to enter the local competition which we ran for them. It doesn’t cost them anything; it’s all free, and we had a delightful presentation night.</p>
      <p>“The standard this year was excellent. There are a lot of people with beautiful gardens in the town, but they don’t pick up an entry form and get involved. I hope we’ll be able to encourage a lot more to enter than what we had this year.”</p>
