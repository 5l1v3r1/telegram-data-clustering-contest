      <p>The Bavarian side claimed an impressive <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/result/result-robert-lewandowski-bags-brace-as-bayern-thump-dortmund-in-der-klassiker_378503.html">4-0 win</a> over title rivals Borussia Dortmund in the club's first league game since <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niko-kovac/"><b>Niko Kovac</b></a> was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/sack-race/news/bayern-munich-sack-niko-kovac-after-frankfurt-humbling_377355.html">sacked</a> prior to the international break.</p>
      <p>Bayern players will have to put rumours of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/transfer-talk/news/bayern-munich-to-appoint-mauricio-pochettino-in-january_380077.html?t1574326729">joining the club</a> out of their heads as they look to close the gap with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bundesliga/table.html">league leaders</a> Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> looks at how Flick's men could line up for the game.</p>
      <hr/>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kingsley-coman/"><b>Kingsley Coman</b></a> (thigh), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jann-fiete-arp/"><b>Jann-Fiete Arp</b></a> (wrist), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-hernandez/"><b>Lucas Hernandez</b></a> (ankle), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niklas-sule/"><b>Niklas Sule</b></a> (knee)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> None</p>
      <p>Flick will not want to make too many changes to the starting lineup that performed so competently against Dortmund, and looks set to field a similarly positive team.</p>
      <p>Indeed, while Kovac often liked to use two holding midfielders, Flick's use of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thiago-alcantara/"><b>Thiago Alcantara</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leon-goretzka/"><b>Leon Goretzka</b></a> as a pair of number eights - as opposed to number sixes - gives Bayern much more vitality in the final third.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned pair are expected to lay the platform for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/serge-gnabry/"><b>Serge Gnabry</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/philippe-coutinho/"><b>Philippe Coutinho</b></a>, who have struck up a dangerous dynamic, with both making sharp diagonal runs to create angles for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-lewandowski/"><b>Robert Lewandowski</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Once again, the latter is simply plundering goals from the number nine position, netting twice against Dortmund and taking tally for this season to 16 goals from 11 Bundesliga games in the process.</p>
      <p>At the base of midfield lies Kimmich, an excellent utility man capable of filling three positions, but whose real calling appears to be screening the back four, using his defensive instincts and composure in possession to dictate proceedings.</p>
      <p>Further back, Flick will see little cause for deviation from the best back four available, which includes Canadian youngster <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alphonso-davies/"><b>Alphonso Davies</b></a>, whose performances at left-back have impressed many this term.</p>
      <p>Moreover, his success in that area means that Flick can partner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-alaba/"><b>David Alaba</b></a> with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/javi-martinez/"><b>Javi Martinez</b></a> in central defence, giving the Bundesliga champions a highly experienced spine - something of a priority given that the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bundesliga/eintracht-frankfurt-vs-bayern-munich_game_100081.html">5-1 loss</a> to Eintracht Frankfurt is still fresh in the minds of the players.</p>
