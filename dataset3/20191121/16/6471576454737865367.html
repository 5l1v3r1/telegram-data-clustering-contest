      <p>Filled with a ceaseless desire to win and a tenacious determination to be the best, he quickly became one of the greatest, if not <i>the greatest</i> of all time in the world of motorsport.</p>
      <p>The documentary about his life, <i>Schumacher</i>, that was scheduled to be released on 5th of December 2019, will keep the fans waiting some more as the premiere was delayed indefinitely.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúThe grand release of Schumacher has been postponed.‚Äù</i> was the official statement of from B/14 Film. ‚Äú<i>The direction and production would like to allow even more time for the completion of the film due to the very extensive material. The new starting date will be announced in due course.‚Äù</i></p>
      <p>It is reported that the directing team gathered too much material and need much more time for editing the documentary than they originally predicted, in order to produce a quality motion picture. Announced in May, the movie promises to tell the story of the pilot from his carting times until the well-known injury that occurred while skiing in the Alps.</p>
      <p>Besides the obvious, his Formula 1 career, not much is known as to what the directors will put their focus on, but it‚Äôs already known that they have a green light from Michael‚Äôs wife Corinna, and his two children Mick and Eugene.</p>
      <p>The movie is being directed by the same team crew that delivered <i>‚ÄúBoris Becker ‚Äì Der Spieler‚Äù</i>, the documentary about the life of the multiple tennis champion, and that gives us a bit of breathing space as they did a good job with that.</p>
      <p>The release of the documentary was supposed to be dedicated to the 50th anniversary of the German born champion, as well as the 25th anniversary of his first championship title. üèÅ</p>

        <summary>PRESS RELEASE</summary>
        <p>Michael Schumacher film with never-before-seen footage of F1 legend's life 'postponed'</p>
        <p>Very little information about Michael Schumacher has been released since his skiing accident in December 2013 - with the new film set to show unreleased footage</p>
        <p>A feature film which was due to celebrate the life of F1 legend Michael Schumacher has been postponed.</p>
        <p>The movie was announced in May and will tell the story of Schumacher, from his time as a talented go-karter in Germany all the way through to his devastating ski-accident.</p>
        <p>His wife Corrina has given her full backing to the film, along with the couple's children Gina and Mick.</p>
        <p>But B14 Film, who are creating the movie, have put back the release date - which will include never before seen footage.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for production company B14 Film said: ‚ÄúDue to the very extensive material the directors and the production want to spend even more time to complete the film.‚Äù</p>

        <p>She said: ‚ÄúThe highlights of his Formula One career, his athletic highs and lows, will be as much a part of the story as previously unseen archive footage.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúIt sheds light on the uncompromising driver, ambitious young man, pragmatic mechanic and confident team player as well as the family man.‚Äù</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, Willi Weber, his long-term manager, said he believed Corinna feared the truth about Schumacher‚Äôs condition entering the public domain.</p>
        <p>But now Corinna has hit back at Weber in a rare interview, saying 50-year-old Schumacher was "in the very best of hands".</p>
        <p>Schumi was ruthless - it made him great</p>
        <p>Manager gives new insight on condition</p>
        <p>"He is in the best of hands right now and we are doing everything we can to help him," she said to She's Mercedes magazine.</p>
        <p>"Try to understand that we follow Michael's desire to keep his health a secret.</p>
        <p>"You can be sure that he is in the very best of hands and that we are doing everything humanly possible to help him.</p>
        <p>"Please understand if we are following Michael's wishes and keeping such a sensitive subject as health, as it has always been, in privacy."</p>
