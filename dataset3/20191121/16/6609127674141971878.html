      <p>Ian’s son Aaron, 19, alerted the postman to the drama as his dad stopped breathing.</p>
      <p>Darren, 41, sprang into action, and carried out life-saving CPR until paramedics arrived.</p>
      <p>Ian had been putting up a false roof at the Glenrothes home when he suffered the life-threatening cardiac arrest.</p>
      <p>He paid tribute to the postie for saving his life.</p>
      <p>He said: “He could have quite easily stood back and phoned an ambulance, but he took a chance and that was enough to keep me going."</p>
      <p>His son Aaron, 19, had called for an ambulance by the time Ian arrived, and he asked if he could help.</p>
      <p>Ian needed three defibrillator shocks to restart his heart - twice in the house and once in the ambulance.</p>

      <p>And he says he owes Darren and Aaron his future.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’ve got five kids, six grandkids and another grandkid on the way, and thanks to Darren I get to see them all and spend Christmas with them.</p>
      <p>“Nobody knows what’s round the corner but he’s given me an opportunity to have more of my life and that’s a gift.</p>
      <p>“It feels like I’ve won the lottery, and to be honest if I had won the lottery I could give every penny to Darren and it still wouldn’t be enough.”</p>
      <p>He added: “There’s so many coincidences and ironies – Aaron is a student at St Andrews University but was off that day, and Darren was putting post through the door just as it happened.</p>
      <p>“I was putting a false roof up, was measuring up and that’s it. Apparently I just pogo-sticked down the stairs on my head and I was out of it.</p>
      <p>“Darren’s a lovely wee character, a great guy, and I probably spent 90% of my time ripping the p**s out of him. But I can’t thank him enough.</p>
      <p>Describing the paramedics as “absolutely outstanding”, Ian’s wife Pauline recalled: “Darren was shaking like a leaf but he even took the time to lock up the doors when we went away in the ambulance and somehow he managed to continue on his rounds.</p>
      <p>“If Darren and Aaron hadn’t acted the way they did then Ian wouldn’t be here.”</p>
      <p>Although Darren is modest about what happened, his wife Kelly has brought his heroic actions to the attention of Royal Mail.</p>
      <p>She said: “I am beyond proud of him.</p>
      <p>“Posties are so committed out in all weathers, but to save a life while out on delivery I feel is something really special, something unforgettable.</p>
      <p>“Darren was a bit withdrawn and quiet after the incident, but was very relieved when he found out the gentleman was in the clear. The thank you card we received had us all in tears.</p>
      <p>“Darren’s never wanted any attention or anything like that, all he was concerned about was Ian and how he was doing.</p>
      <p>“He just acted on instinct and he said he just did what anybody would have done.”</p>
