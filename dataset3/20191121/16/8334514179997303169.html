      <p>JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel’s attorney general indicted Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on corruption charges on Thursday, raising more uncertainty over who will ultimately lead a country mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections this year.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced the decision in a statement. The charges included bribery, breach of trust and fraud.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, who has denied wrongdoing in three corruption cases, is under no legal obligation to resign after being charged. He is due to make a statement at 2030 GMT.</p>
