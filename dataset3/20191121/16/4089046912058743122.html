      <p><b>SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) â€”</b> Lady Vol Jordan Horston faced a judge Thursday after being arrested and charged with shoplifting at Tommy Hilfiger at Tanger Outlets in Sevierville in August.</p>

      <p>A report shows Horston admitted to taking items valued at $124.97.</p>
      <p>A Tommy Hilfiger employee reportedly witnessed the incident and called police.</p>
      <p>Thursday, a judge granted Horston diversion for 11 months and 29 days. She must complete 20 hours of public service and pay court costs. She is also banned from Tanger Outlet Mall.</p>
      <p>According to records, after completion of the requirements, the case will be dismissed and the charges expunged from Horston's record.</p>
      <p>Horston has already been reprimanded by the University, but officials said she will continue to play on the team.</p>
      <p>Lady Vols spokesperson Eric Trainer said, "We have been aware of this situation. It was addressed initially back in the summer, including a game suspension during the team's European trip. We believe Jordan has learned from this and used it as an opportunity for growth."</p>
