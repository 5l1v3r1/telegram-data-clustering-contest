      <p><a href="http://www.fotospor.com/haber-trabzonspor-badou-ndiayenin-trabzonspora-gelmesini-isteyen-isim-352747">According to Fotospor,</a> former Galatasaray sporting director Cenk Ergun is behind Trabzonspor’s interest in Stoke City midfielder Badou Ndiaye.</p>
      <p>Ergun recently informed the Turkish media the Super Lig side were close to getting a deal done for the player.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed Ergun, who worked with Ndiaye’s agent William D’Avila when he was at Galatasaray, is said to be working with him again to get the Senegalese a move to Trabzonspor.</p>
      <p>The Turkish giants are just two points behind the league leaders Sivasspor and they will be looking to strengthen their squad in the new year to bolster their title chances.</p>
      <p>Midfield is a priority for Karadeniz Firtinasi ahead of the next transfer window as their current options are struggling with injuries.</p>
      <p>However, it’s been reported by Fotospor that a return to Turkey is unlikely at this stage given the Stoke City midfielder’s potential cost to Trabzonspor.</p>
      <p>Last season Ndiaye spent the season on loan with Turkish champions Galatasaray but retuned to Stoke City in the summer.</p>
