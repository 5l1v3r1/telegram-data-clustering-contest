      <p>Prince Andrew met with Jeffrey Epstein’s accused madam Ghislaine Maxwell this summer — after the heat had already been turned up on his pedophile pal’s depraved behavior, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York met <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/ghislaine-maxwell-is-too-loyal-to-prince-andrew-to-implicate-him-in-fbi-interview-insider-says/">close friend Maxwell</a> in the first week of June when she was in London for the Cash &amp; Rocket charity motor rally that ended four days later in Monaco, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7709765/Prince-Andrew-secret-meeting-Ghislaine-Maxwell-London-June.html">according to the Daily Mail</a>.</p>
      <p>Maxwell, 57, was not in publicity photos taken at the event and was scrubbed from the rally’s website Thursday, the report says. But she shared car number 28 with Nettie Mason, the wife of Pink Floyd rocker Nick Mason, at the event also attended by Paris Hilton and Chloe Green, the report says.</p>
      <p>It is thought to be the last time she had been in the UK before she disappeared after Epstein’s July arrest and then his death the following month in a Manhattan lockup.</p>
      <p>Andrew admitted during his recent disastrous BBC interview that he last saw his friend in the spring or summer, but insisted they did not talk about mutual friend Epstein “because he wasn’t in the news.”</p>

      <p>“We had moved on,” he said of the loyal friend who first introduced him to Epstein, sparking the downfall that this week saw him end his royal duties.</p>
      <p>While it was before Epstein’s arrest, the pedophile had been back in the news — with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/16/another-jeffrey-epstein-accuser-comes-forward-against-billionaire-pedophile/">fresh accusers coming forward</a> and also an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/06/justice-department-probing-how-it-handled-serial-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein/">official probe into his sweetheart deal</a> in Florida following his earlier conviction.</p>
      <p>Maxwell was also under renewed pressure at the time, fighting to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/11/judge-gives-deadline-for-arguments-relating-to-unsealing-jeffrey-epstein-documents/">keep sealed legal documents</a> brought by accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who sued her for publicly denying that she lured her as an underage girl into Epstein’s harem. Maxwell always denied the allegations.</p>
