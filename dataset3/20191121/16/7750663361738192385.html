      <p>As a result of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-ruthless-liverpool-overcome-man-city-at-anfield_378576.html">suffering a 3-1 defeat</a> at the hands of Liverpool before the international break, City now sit in fourth position, one point adrift of the Blues.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a>'s side head into this contest having won five of the last six encounters between the two clubs.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> predicts how the defending champions could line up for the showdown at the Etihad Stadium.</p>

      <p><b>Out:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/leroy-sane/"><b>Leroy Sane</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/aymeric-laporte/"><b>Aymeric Laporte</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/oleksandr-zinchenko/"><b>Oleksandr Zinchenko</b></a> (knee), <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bernardo-silva/"><b>Bernardo Silva</b></a> (suspended)<br/><b>Doubtful:</b> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ederson/"><b>Ederson</b></a> (muscle)</p>
      <p>City will be without midfielder Bernardo Silva after the Portuguese was handed a one-match ban for a post made on social media.</p>
      <p>However, goalkeeper Ederson has provided Guardiola with a much-needed boost after returning to training after a muscle injury, a development which should see the Brazilian stopper replace <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/claudio-bravo/"><b>Claudio Bravo</b></a>.</p>
      <p>A further change could be made at left-back with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/benjamin-mendy/"><b>Benjamin Mendy</b></a> likely to be preferred to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angelino/"><b>Angelino</b></a>, who was handed a rare start against Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Having remained as an unused substitute against the Merseyside giants, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/david-silva/"><b>David Silva</b></a> could take the place of either <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodri/"><b>Rodri</b></a> or <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ilkay-gundogan/"><b>Ilkay Gundogan</b></a> in midfield.</p>
      <p>With Bernardo sitting out the game and Leroy Sane still a couple of months away from recovering from a knee injury, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/riyad-mahrez/"><b>Riyad Mahrez</b></a> may feature on the right flank.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergio-aguero/"><b>Sergio Aguero</b></a> is likely to get the nod over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gabriel-jesus/"><b>Gabriel Jesus</b></a> in attack.</p>
