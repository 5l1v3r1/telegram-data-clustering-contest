      <h1>Tyler, The Creator: I Like Girls, I Just End Up F***ing Their Brother Every Time</h1>

      <p>People have been trying to get a clear answer about Tyler, The Creator's sexuality which he addressed on his 2017 project <i>Flower Boy</i>. On the song "I Ain’t Got Time," Tyler raps, "I been kissing white boys since 2004." He also rapped in "Garden Shed," "Truth is, since you kid, I thought it was a phase/Thought it would be like the Frank poof, gone/But, it’s still going on." </p>
      <p>In a new GQ profile, Tyler pushed the envelope further by stating, "I like girls. I just end up f*cking their brother every time." The rest of the article doesn't address Tyler's dating life, but he opened up about avoiding people he calls "goobers." Tyler explains that he avoids anyone wearing Fila chunky sneakers, loose boots (the kind of boots that jeans can be tucked into), people that have "weed breath," and people that don't moisturize.</p>
      <p>The feature also focused on Tyler's milestone year after dropping his highly-acclaimed and <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259088/nipsey-hussle-nominated-for-3-grammys-full-nominee-list-revealed">Grammy-nominated</a> album, <i>IGOR</i>. Tyler explained that the project is sung from the perspective of an alter ego, complete with a blonde mushroom cut wig and a pantsuit, as Tyler explains that he wants to imagine himself as a "f*cking white lady in Denmark." </p>
