      <p>“You” became a surprise hit on Netflix and took a very unusual path to get there.</p>
      <p>Airing on Lifetime to middling ratings, the show was cancelled after its first season. But when the series — in which a writer (Penn Badgely) becomes obsessed with a bookstore manager (Elizabeth Lail) — then began streaming on Netflix, “You” found an audience. In fact, “You” ultimately became one of the streaming service’s most watched shows, with Netflix claiming the show had been seen by <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/408275/lifetime-stalker-drama-you-is-a-huge-hit-for-netflix-40-million-streams-in-first-month/">40 million viewers</a> in its first month.</p>
      <p>Netflix then jumped on reviving the show, ordering a second season that is set to debut next month.</p>

      <p>“Netflix was clear they wanted us to give them a show that was like season one,” Gamble tells <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/21/you-season-2-first-look-joe-love/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>. “They basically said, ‘It’s not broke, don’t fix it.’ ”</p>
      <p>The big change, she reveals, is that Badgley’s Joe will move from New York to Los Angeles for season two, where he’ll meet a woman named Love (Victoria Pedretti).</p>
      <p>“It’s not that simple love-at-first-sight he might’ve been looking for a couple of years ago,” Gamble says. “He’s a different guy. He’s been through more… the circumstances of his encounter with Love are very informed by what he went through with Beck.”</p>

      <p>The first season ended with the revelation that Joe’s ex, Candace (Ambyr Childers), is actually alive, and she <i>will</i> be a factor in the new season. “She is a survivor,” Gamble says. “And now she’s faced with some really difficult decisions about how she’s going to move forward.”</p>
      <p>The second season of “You” debuts on Thursday, Dec. 26.</p>
