      <p>Thursday's impeachment witnesses have so far only added to the quid pro quo case against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Former National Security Council adviser on Russia Fiona Hill and diplomat in Ukraine David Holmes testified in a public impeachment hearing Thursday. And just like their foreign service colleagues <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/879653/sondland-confirms-quid-pro-quo-points-finger-directly-trump">before them</a>, they provided further evidence that Trump set out conditionals for Ukraine to receive aid and a White House meeting, spelling out the quid pro quo he has so far denied.</p>
      <p>In his testimony, Holmes <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/880109/diplomat-david-holmes-recounts-sondlands-loud-recognizable-call-where-trump-brought-biden-investigations">described a call</a> he overheard between U.S. Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland and Trump, in which he heard Trump's "loud and recognizable" voice ask Sondland if Ukraine would start an unnamed investigation. He <a href="https://twitter.com/moscow_project/status/1197547509100556289">later said</a> he thought Ukraine, upon realizing its aid from the U.S. hadn't arrived yet, would've "drawn that conclusion" that the aid was conditioned upon starting the investigation.</p>
      <p>Hill provided more than just assumptions, testifying that Sondland told her that a White House meeting for Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky was dependent on him launching the investigations — and specifically saying Sondland was referring to the Bidens. Kathryn Krawczyk</p>
