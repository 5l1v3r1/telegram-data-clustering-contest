      <p>Aston Villa fans have had their say on transfer speculation linking them with a move for Nicolas Gaitan.</p>
      <p>Gaitan <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/nicolas-gaitan-aston-villa-transfer-17293882">is a free agent with his contract at MLS side Chicago Fire up in December</a> although there is an option for him to stay on for the 2020 season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> will be hoping to bolster their options in the New Year when the January transfer window opens, but they could sign Gaitan sooner with the 31-year-old Boca Juniors academy product set to be unattached when his contract expires in Chicago.</p>
      <p>West Ham United and Sheffield United are also said to be interested in the former Dalian Yifang man, with Manuel Pellegrini's side <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/west-ham-transfer-news-gaitan-17295839">reported to have held talks with Gaitan's representatives</a> .</p>
