      <p>Dozens of people were hit by a vomiting and diarrhoea bug after going to an event called The Brick Show.</p>
      <p>There was a suspected mass norovirus outbreak at the venue in Bristol where adult Lego fans had gathered to build models and play games.</p>
      <p>Adult Lego users group GertLug spokesman Nick Amos said: ‘People always like to have something or someone to blame nowadays, but it seems like one of those things.’</p>
      <p>But one anonymous participant claimed: ‘The food wasn’t great and over the weekend the toilets weren’t well maintained, the basins didn’t work well and there was no hand sanitiser.</p>
      <p>‘At least 40 people I know have been affected.’</p>
      <p>People who had travelled from miles around to the Action Indoor Sports venue did not even make it home before the symptoms struck, according to reports.</p>

      <p>Amos said: ‘I don’t think it was the food or the toilets or anything, because it seems to have been so random.’</p>
      <p>He said his brother came down with the bug after attending, even though he did not eat or go to the toilet there.</p>
      <p>Organisers posted on Facebook to say they were ‘devastated that this has put a damper on an otherwise successful show’.</p>
      <p>They said: ‘Obviously we wish everyone who is affected a speedy recovery.</p>
      <p>‘Unfortunately there were no reports of sickness made during the duration of the show therefore we had no way of warning anyone nor identifying a source at the time.’</p>
