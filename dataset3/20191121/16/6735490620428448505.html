      <h1>Charlize Theron Says Backers Of ‘Monster’ Were Hoping For ‘A Hot Lesbian Movie With Me And Christina Ricci’</h1>

      <p>Not only was “Monster” a critically acclaimed drama that marked the feature-film debut of “Wonder Woman” director Patty Jenkins, the film also brought star Charlize Theron the Best Actress Oscar at the 2004 Academy Awards.</p>
      <p>“Monster” was also the first film on which Theron served as producer, and she opened up about fighting for the film’s integrity during a producers’ roundtable for <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/charlize-theron-peter-chernin-producer-roundtable-1256085"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a>.</p>
      <p>“I started producing on Monster, and it just happened that I felt the need to protect a first-time director, who was really taking a huge risk,” said Theron, 44, admitting that the character she was playing — serial-killer prostitute Aileen Wuornos, who was executed in 2002 — was “very unusual.”</p>

      <p>This led to some misunderstandings with the film’s financial backers about what kind of film they were paying for.</p>
      <p>“And initially when we went in to get our financing, it became very clear to me that there was this need for me to step in,” Theron explained. “Because I think the financiers actually thought they were basically paying for a hot lesbian movie with me and Christina Ricci.”</p>
      <p>Although this was her first experience as a producer, Theron was no Hollywood neophyte, and realized the filmmakers were going to “come up against things”  — which did come to pass when she began gaining weight to play Wuornos.</p>

      <p>“There were a lot of fights,” she admitted. “As soon as I started gaining weight, I had one of the financiers call me up. Actually, his wife saw me, and she was like, ‘Did you see Charlize? Have you seen what she looks like?'”</p>

      <p>Theron wound up looking barely recognizable after shaving her eyebrows, wearing a set of prosthetic teeth and putting on 30-pounds for the role — which did not go over well with the people who were putting up the money.</p>
      <p>“And I got that call, like, ‘What’s going on with that?’ This is back in the day when it took, like, three weeks for dailies to make it back here, and I got a call at 3 a.m. from the guy,” she said. “He was like, ‘What are you doing? You never smiled. You look so angry, you look horrible.'”</p>

      <p>Due to those factors and the dark nature of “Monster”, the film had a tough time finding distribution. According to Theron, she and Jenkins were “about to sign the contract for a straight-to-video with Blockbuster on ‘Monster’ because no distributor would pick it up — literally, the lawyer was coming to the editing room — we got a call from [distributor] Bob Berney,” she said. “Those things happen where you stop trying, you almost give up and surrender. But then magic happens. It is a little bit like, we work in a business where we are trying to constantly capture that lightning in a bottle, right? And if it was all about just manufacturing it, then everybody would probably be able to do it.”</p>
