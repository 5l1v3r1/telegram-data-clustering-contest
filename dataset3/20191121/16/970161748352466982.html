      <p>Finn Jones announced that he will be swapping streaming services as he joins <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/apple-tv/">Apple TV+</a> after the cancellation of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a>’s Iron Fist.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones</a> actor will be the latest addition to the cast of comedy-drama Dickinson’s second season.</p>
      <p>The show stars <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/hailee-steinfeld/">Hailee Steinfeld</a> in the title role as poet Emily Dickinson, 30 Rock legend Jane Krakowski plays Dickinson’s over-bearing mother.</p>
      <p>There’s no details as to what character he will be playing, however, with the news of his casting being shared by Dickinson showrunner Alena Smith.</p>
      <p>Jones’ move will see him back on the small screen after Netflix <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/10/13/marvels-iron-fist-cancelled-after-two-seasons-on-netflix-8033980/">cancelled the Marvel TV series Iron FIst after just two seasons</a>.</p>
      <p>It was part of a wider cull of Marvel properties from the platform thanks to the introduction of Disney+. Every other live-action Marvel production on Netflix – from Daredevil to Luke Cage – met the same fate.</p>

      <p>The first season of Iron Fist released in March 2017 was mauled by the critics, with many seeing it as the first major misstep in Netflix’s Marvel shows.</p>

      <p>A second season was released a year later, and while it was received more warmly, it perhaps didn’t quite catch enough fire to warrant more investment.</p>
      <p>Dickinson was one of the launch shows for Apple’s streaming service Apple TV+, alongside the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jennifer-aniston/">Jennifer Aniston</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/reese-witherspoon/">Reese Witherspoon</a>-lead The Morning Show.</p>
      <p>We said Steinfeld shone in the titular role. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/dickinson-review-hailee-steinfeld-shines-apple-tv-pluss-modern-twist-lgbt-icon-11026235/">and praised the show for being a surprising and evocative LGBT+-centric exploration of Dickinson’s life</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s also been announced that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a>’s Runaways <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/marvels-runaways-to-end-after-season-3-is-disney-to-blame-11179323/">will be ending after its third season</a>.</p>
      <p>Runaways was one of the last live-action series in production under the Marvel Television brand. All six of Netflix’s MCU tie-ins – including Daredevil and Jessica Jones – have been culled to make way for original series for Disney+.</p>
      <p>There are a number of series in the works to air on the streaming service, including WandaVision and a Hawkeye spin-off, and with the news of Runaway’s imminent demise, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D will be the last show standing when it airs its seventh (and also final) season next year.</p>
