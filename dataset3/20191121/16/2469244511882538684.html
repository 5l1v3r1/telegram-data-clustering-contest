      <p>Samantha Abrahams, musical director of La La Choirs, said: “I am so delighted that the work of the music team at Uffculme School has been showcased today and that they have won and will be performing with us in December. </p>
      <p>“The staff are clearly very dedicated, and it really shone through at the final.</p>
      <p>“This event is one of the highlights of the year for La La Choirs and will be raising money for St Luke’s Hospice, a vital and much loved Plymouth charity.
