      <h1>Ladies Football revamp senior structures for 2020 - with no Leinster Championship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/tony-leen/" target="_blank">By Tony Leen</a></address>
      <p>The Ladies Gaelic Football Association has revealed a major revamp of the 2020 All-Ireland Senior Championship structure.</p>
      <p>Next year's All-Ireland series will consist of two six-team groups, with the top two from each group progressing to the All-Ireland semi-finals, following a minimum of five games.</p>
      <p>The Provincial championships will consequently be organised on a knock-out basis, with the winners seeded in the draw for the All-Ireland series.</p>
      <p>The bottom team in each group will contest a relegation play-off, unless they are a provincial winner, and thereby exempt from relegation.</p>
      <p>There will be no Senior Championship in Leinster for 2020, and the groups for the All-Ireland series will be decided at the LGFAâ€™s next Central Council meeting, and circulated thereafter.</p>
