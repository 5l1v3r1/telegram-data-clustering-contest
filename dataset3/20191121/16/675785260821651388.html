      <p>Be prepared for a whole new cinematic experience of gang wars in London.</p>
      <p>Blue Story follows best friends Timmy (Stephen Odubola) and Marco (Michael Ward) as they are caught up in a painful and seemingly endless cycle of post code gang wars.</p>
      <p>Having gone to the same Peckham high school together, everything changed when Marco was assaulted by a friend of Timmy's from primary school, forcing the him and Timmy onto rival sides in the classes.</p>
      <p>In a world exclusive clip for Mirror Online, we see <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/top-boy">Top Boy</a> star Ward, Odubola, and Karla-Simone Spence in the gritty new drama.</p>
      <p>The film is based on the trilogy of short films of the same name by rapper, YouTube star, and director, Andrew Onwubolu aka Rapman, who also wrote the script for the film.</p>
      <p>Blue Story is also produced by Belle, Kidulthood, and Adulthood producer <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/damian-jones">Damian Jones.</a></p>
      <p>Top Boy star Michael Ward has said of the film: "As an actor you want to be involved in big projects and I just felt that this was something big … the message is so powerful that a lot of people are going to want to be involved … It’s [a message] that doesn't just stretch across the country, it stretches across the globe! These are stories that can be translated across the world."</p>
      <p>Will Timmy and Marco salvage their friendship or face tragedy in the gang war?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blue Story is released in UK cinemas on November 22, 2019.</b>
