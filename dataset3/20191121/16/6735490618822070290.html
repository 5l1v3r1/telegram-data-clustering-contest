      <p>Isaac Hempstead Wright is weighing in on the hotly-debated “Game of Thrones” ending that left fans divided back in May.</p>
      <p>While joining his co-stars Gemma Whelan and Kristofer Hivju to celebrate the release of the “Game of Thrones: The Complete Collection” DVD/Blu-ray set at the BFI Southbank in London, the 20-year-old actor tells ET Canada that he felt the ending of the final season stayed “true to the spirit” of “Game of Thrones”.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>“I thought it was great,” he says. “I know it was a divisive ending, but as far as I’m concerned it was the only way we could have ended ‘Game of Thrones’. It was true to the spirit of it. Not everything happened that people wanted to happen. It was quite uncomfortable at times and that’s what good television should do.”</p>

      <p>As for Bran Stark’s momentous story arc in the final season, Hempstead Wright admits that he was “thrilled” upon discovering that his character ended up on the throne. “It couldn’t have gone much better for me,” he proudly tells ET Canada.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>Revealing if his character would do a good job as the King of Westeros, the actor jokingly contends, “I’d like to think so. Although it has been pointed out to me that he basically does have the world’s largest CCTV archive, so it might have become an authoritarian rule. I’m not sure. He needs good people behind him.”</p>
      <p>While Hempstead Wright previously told <i><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/game-thrones-isaac-hempstead-wright-20642566">Mirror UK</a></i> that the cast group chat on Whatsapp was “dead,” the actor tells ET Canada that they do still keep in touch.</p>
      <p>“We’re actually all pretty good at keeping in touch with each other and it’s a small world, so you bump into each other all the time,” he says.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, speaking about her own character’s ending, Gemma Whelan says she was “very happy” seeing Yara Greyjoy become the Lady of the Iron Islands.</p>
      <p>“It would have been nice if Yara killed Euron [Greyjoy], but, you know, you can’t have it all,” she quips. “But, yeah, I was very happy. I mean, you can’t sort of complain about being part of such a huge show like that, you know? I was lucky to be in it as I was and to survive.”</p>

      <p>Up next, HBO has announced production for the spin-off series “House of the Dragon”, which will be based on the origins of House Targaryen, according to HBO programming president Casey Bloys.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the continuation of “GoT”, Kristofer Hivju, who appeared in character as Tormund Giantsbane at the celebration event, contends, “I think the universe is so large and has so many possibilities that I hope we will see many spin-offs. And I think that the choice of going for a Targaryen storyline is great.”</p>
