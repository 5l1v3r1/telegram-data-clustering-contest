      <p>Serbia’s finance minister is facing calls to resign after a university claimed he plagiarised parts of his PhD thesis.</p>
      <p>Belgrade University, arguably Serbia’s most prestigious place of learning, said in a statement that Sinisa Mali “literally took over texts, or entire paragraphs, from the texts of other authors without listing the names of the authors”.</p>
      <p>University dean Ivanka Popovic told state broadcaster RTS that Mr Mali’s 2013 paper, which focuses on restructuring and privatisation, will be annulled.</p>
      <p>Mr Mali has denied the accusation.</p>
      <p>He said: “I know I didn’t do it.</p>
      <p>“Right now, I am interested in Serbia’s budget (for 2020) and to do the job Serbian citizens pay me for.”</p>
      <p>But the accusation has prompted calls for the resignation of Mr Mali, who is a close ally of President Aleksandar Vucic and previously served as the mayor of the capital Belgrade.</p>
      <p>An anti-government movement has called a protest rally for Monday.</p>
