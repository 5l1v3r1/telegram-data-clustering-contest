      <h1>PABRA introduces baked beans varieties to farmers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:42:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:42</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Asante, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Kwadaso (Ash), Nov. 20, GNA - The Crops Research Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CRI-CSIR), has introduced four new common bean (baked beans) varieties, for adoption by farmers.</p>
      <p>The objective is that local farmers would be encouraged to cultivate the new varieties of the pulses - ‘Ennepa’, ‘Adoye’, ‘Nsoroma’ and ‘Semanhyia’, on a larger scale to enhance their livelihoods.</p>
      <p>In pursuance of this objective, a field trip has been organized by the CRI-CSIR to enable selected farmers tour its Kwadaso Research Station in the Ashanti Region, to demonstrate the agronomic importance of the varieties.</p>
      <p>They were exposed to the characteristics, yield potentials and commercial value of the exportable commodities, especially on the international market.</p>
      <p>Common beans contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients, providing protein, fiber, folate, iron, potassium and magnessium for the wellbeing of consumers.</p>
      <p>Dr James Yaw Asibuo, National Coordinator for the Pan-African Bean Research Allaince (PABRA), in an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA), said the varieties were bred under the “Improving Bean Productivity and Market in Africa” project.</p>
      <p>It is being spearheaded by PABRA and the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.</p>
      <p>So far, the collaborative institutions have supervised the cultivation of about 20 acres of common beans, on an experimental basis at the CRI-CSIR’s Research Stations, including Asante-Mampong, Akomadan and Fumesua.    </p>
      <p>Researchers and scientists working on the project are elated about the success story, describing the release of the new common bean varieties as a breakthrough.</p>
      <p>“This is due to the fact that those varieties alien to the West African terrain, have proven to thrive well on Ghanaian soil unlike other countries in the sub-Region still grappling to successfully cultivate those type of beans under a similar project,” Dr Asibuo said.</p>
      <p>He said they were working with stakeholders at various levels to promote the commercial cultivation of common beans in the interest of the nation and farmers.</p>
      <p>Dr Asibuo, who is a Principal Research Scientist of the CRI-CSIR and also the Steering Committee Chairman of the West and Central Africa Bean Research Network, said PABRA has adopted a bean corridor approach in its work across Africa.</p>
      <p>This is to promote bean production, distribution and consumption nationally and regionally, stressing that there was a ready market for bean farmers.</p>
