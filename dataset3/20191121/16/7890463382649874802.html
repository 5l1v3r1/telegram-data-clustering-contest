      <h1>Forza Horizon 4 update adds this legendary car</h1>

        <b>Good news, Forza fans: Toyota’s cars will once again make an appearance in Playground Games’ open world racing title <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/forza-horizon-4">Forza Horizon 4</a>. That’s according to a tweet posted by Forza Motorsport announcing that the car company is back, with the shiny 1998 Supra RZ heading to the game in an update next month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The fourth generation version of the Toyota Supra will arrive as part of the Forza Horizon 4 series 17 update on December 12. While it’s not confirmed, it appears the car will be free as part of the update, rather than cost money as a paid add-on.</p>
      <p>It’s a somewhat surprising announcement given that earlier this year <a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/29510/toyota-backtracks-on-why-it-wont-license-cars-to-video-games-like-need-for-speed">Toyota indicated</a> on its UK Twitter channel that players would only be able to find its cars in track-based PlayStation 4 racing game Gran Turismo Sport because it didn’t tie into street racing.</p>
      <p>However, the company later followed up with a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/ToyotaUK/status/1164177380711288832">tweets</a> suggesting their cars could, in fact, come to other games: “We love that you want to see our cars in all your favourite racing games, and honestly, we want the same thing,” the Toyota UK channel said.</p>

      <p>“We’re currently limited in what we can say and yesterday we got our response wrong. We’ll be really excited to share our future plans with you as soon as we’re able to. In the meantime, whether it’s Gran Turismo Sport, Forza, or Need for Speed, keep on racing.”</p>
      <p>Well, the Toyota Supra’s appearance in Forza Horizon 4 is now official, and it won’t be long before it arrives. Get ready to jump behind its wheels December 12.</p>
