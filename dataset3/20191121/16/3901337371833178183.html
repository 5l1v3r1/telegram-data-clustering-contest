      <h1>‘Maybe Cups Are Meant For Certain Clubs’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:03:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:03</time> by <a rel="author">Mazola Molefe</a></address>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns assistant coach Manqoba Mnqgithi has suggested that the aligning of the domestic and continental calendar this season could be the turning point to the club ending a four-year trophy drought in local cup competitions.</p>
      <p>While the Brazilians have been crowned Absa Premiership champions three more times since 2015, the MTN8, Telkom Knockout and Nedbank Cup has eluded them.</p>
      <p>The club wants to change that.</p>

      <p>“I can’t point a finger (as to why) because I always believe in every season the team we have has got the capacity to win all four (trophies),” said Mnqgithi ahead of Sundowns facing Golden Arrows in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Recently, the continent’s governing body CAF made changes to its fixture schedule by switching it to kick off in August and end in May.</p>
      <p>Mnqgithi said it was a plus for Sundowns.</p>
      <p>“We have had bad schedules in the past with the Champions League overlapping and not giving the team a chance to have pre-season. This time we have a better programme in terms of the team getting a chance to rest, like others. But the congestion is a little bit tough for us at times. Even now in December, everyone will be enjoying Christmas and we will be in Algeria on Christmas Day. But it does not mean we should not win these other cups. We are just unfortunate,” the coach said.</p>
      <p>He joked that their misfortune was also to the benefit of other teams, who normally would not be considered title challengers and therefore make domestic cups a priority.</p>
      <p>“At times in football you think that maybe cups are meant for certain clubs because God is trying to balance the equation. There are teams that do well in cup competitions, but you will never see them in the league. At Sundowns we always go for everything we can get – it would be nice in one season to get to a point where we can win all cups and the league. But at times we must not be too greedy,” added Mnqgithi.</p>
