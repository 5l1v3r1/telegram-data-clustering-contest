      <h1>Stephen A. Smith “Not Hearing Good Things” About Kyrie Irving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:46:37+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Rightly or wrongly, Kyrie Irving has gained a reputation for moodiness and attitude problems. But there is no denying that he is still an incredible NBA talent – nor can it be denied that he was a package deal with fellow-megastar Kevin Durant.</p>
      <p>But amidst an underwhelming 6-8 start to the season with Durant out for the year, it seems that things may be unravelling at the Barclays Center.</p>
      <p>On Thursday’s edition of <i><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dzl2jb/stephen_a_smith_i_will_tell_you_this_i_am_not/">First Take</a></i>, ESPN analyst Stephen A Smith asserted that all is not well in Brooklyn. He conveyed that from he’s hearing, Kyrie’s mood and attitude are becoming an issue.</p>
      <blockquote>“I will tell you this, I am not hearing good things about Kyrie in Brooklyn. You’re hearing about his mood; people are putting things out there. I’m telling you there’s stuff circulating out there about him from an attitude perspective.”</blockquote>
      <p>It’s hard to figure out exactly what it is that Stephen A is trying to say. But the implication certainly seems to be that Kyrie isn’t helping things in the locker room.</p>
      <p>None of what Stephen A is saying is necessarily bearing out on the court though. Kyrie is currently averaging career-highs in most categories with 28.5 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.2 assists per game.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the problem in Brooklyn also lies in the fact that the Nets disassembled key parts of the team that made the playoffs last year in an effort to sign Durant – who won’t be available for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case may be, the Nets are struggling right now, and Kyrie is going to be depended on to be a part of the solution.</p>
