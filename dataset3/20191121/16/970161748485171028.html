      <p>With just over a week of November left, Christmas trees will start popping up in windows everywhere.</p>
      <p>If you’re in need of some inspiration, take a look at these amazing creations by mum-of-three Tina Robinson.</p>
      <p>Every year, the 40-year-old transforms an artificial tree into a different masterpiece – and she only spends £40.</p>
      <p>The designs take up to three weeks to create but it’s included everything from a Minion-themed tree inspired by a family holiday to Florida to an angel-shaped tree in memory of her grandparents.</p>
      <p>This year, Tina spent one hour per night for three weeks perfecting a dog-friendly tree hanging from the ceiling where it can’t be reached by newly adopted French Bulldog, Caesar.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘Caesar can’t be trusted yet, so I’ve attached hooks in the ceiling and hung each branch up and put his kennel underneath so he can’t reach it.</p>

      <p>‘I make all sorts of stuff. I’ve always been quite crafty and I love Christmas.</p>
      <p>‘I got the idea when I went to Florida, I came back and made a Minion tree. Nobody wants the same Christmas decorations every year.</p>

      <p>‘I usually spend £40 on the decorations, I always get new baubles to match the theme but it’s the same tree under the decorations.</p>
      <p>‘It’s good to be different – our old tree was just so ordinary, it came out of the loft every year and it was just boring.</p>
      <p>‘Now, it looks different each year.’</p>

      <p>Tina said her children, Leah, 22, Dean, 21, and Jay, 11, look forward to seeing their mum’s festive creations every year but partner, Craig Wardley, 40, thinks she’s ‘crazy.’</p>
      <p>Tina gets most of her decorations from eBay and the garden centre and has been using the same £40 Christmas tree as a base for her quirky designs since 2015.</p>
      <p>Tina said: ‘Jay loves it. He gets excited to see what I’m going to make and he helps me.</p>

      <p>‘I start planning about one month before, I’ll draw a picture and then start collecting the decorations.</p>
      <p>‘It gets me in the Christmas spirit. I love that Christmassy feeling, it’s brilliant.</p>

      <p>‘But Craig does wonder where on earth I get all these crazy ideas from.’</p>
