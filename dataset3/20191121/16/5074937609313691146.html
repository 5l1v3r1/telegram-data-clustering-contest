      <h1>NADMO inaugurates District Disaster Management Committees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:51:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Opesika Tetteh Puplampu, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Sege (GAR), Nov. 20, GNA - The National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) has inaugurated the District Disaster Management Committees for Ada West, Ada East and Ningo Prampram.</p>
      <p>The committees are chaired by the District Chief Executives and includes head of agencies at the district level.</p>
      <p>Mr Seji Saji, the Greater Accra Regional Deputy Director General, Technical and Reforms, NADMO, charged the committee members to look at disaster risk reduction to help society fight the problem.</p>
      <p>He said the formation of the committees was to put the new law of NADMO, Act 927, which mandates every district to have a disaster management committee.</p>
      <p>The committees are mandated to draw out disaster management plans for the year and roll out action plans.</p>
      <p>Mr Saji said it was the responsibility of the committees to draw a plan and come up with the measures to minimize the risks that disasters posed.</p>
      <p>"We can't prevent disaster but can minimize its risks through our human activities. These committees, largely, will look at disaster risk reduction rather than even responding to disasters as organisations,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We are focusing more on disaster risks reduction, identifying the risks, coming out with measures to reduce the risks and at the end of the day, if disaster occurs, the whole district responds together.”</p>
      <p>Mr A. L. Akrofi, the DCE for Ada West, who chaired the inauguration, said it was necessary for the districts to manage the disasters, most of which had been recurring.</p>
      <p>“We choke the gutters through indiscriminate disposal of refuse. Water has to find a different way if you block its way and this accounts for the flooding in our homes.”</p>
      <p>“I want to encourage all citizens to embrace and work with these committees so that we can, together, minimise the risks”.</p>
      <p>Major I. K. E. Amoah, Second in Command, First Infantry Battalion,    Ghana Army, told journalists that the Army was ready to partner any venture to ensure national development.</p>
      <p>"These committees have become necessary due to the recent disasters we had, especially floods…. People build in water ways, blocking streams, and other water bodies.”</p>
      <p>He expressed the hope that the committees would come up with plans to resolve the challenges.</p>
      <p>Present at the inauguration were: Ms Serah Dugbakie Pobee, DCE for Ada East; Mr Jonathan Teye Paa Nii Doku, DCE for Ningo Prampram, DSP George Aboagye, Sege Police Commander; Chief Superintendent George Andrew Kumah, Ada Divisional Police Commander, and Madam Cynthia W. Aku Gbadago, Ada West Educational Director.</p>
