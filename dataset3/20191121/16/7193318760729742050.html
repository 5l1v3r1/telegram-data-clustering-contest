      <p>Since dropping its only game of the season, Perkins-Tryon's defense has been stout.</p>
      <p>The Demons have allowed only 31 points in five games while picking up a shutout since losing to Class 3A No. 1 Heritage Hall after a late touchdown. Since then, No. 4 Perkins-Tryon has proven it is one of the toughest teams in the class because of its defense.</p>
      <p>After a 35-6 victory against Sulphur in the first round, the Demons (10-1) travel to take on Verdigris at 7 p.m Friday. The Cardinals (9-2) have won seven straight games and defeated Idabel in the first round.</p>
      <p>Demons' coach <b>Bruce Williams</b> said controlling the tempo will be important against a potent Verdigris offense. In Perkins-Tryon's victory against Sulphur, it held the ball for nearly 40 minutes of game time.</p>
      <p>"We've got to limit their possessions as best as we can," Williams said. "They definitely have the capability of scoring on big plays. For us to be successful, we're going to have to have ball control on offense."</p>
