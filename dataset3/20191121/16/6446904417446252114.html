      <h1>HSE urges public to get flu vaccine as data shows annual flu season could hit 'within weeks'</h1>
      <h2>The executive briefed the media on the latest update on its ‘winter plan’ today.</h2>

      <p>THE HEALTH SERVICE Executive (HSE) has urged vulnerable groups to get vaccinated after new data showed that the annual flu season is expected to arrive within weeks.</p>
      <p>Figures released by the executive at a weekly update of its ‘winter plan’ today showed that the number of cases of influenza-like illnesses has risen compared with the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Data also showed that 19 people were hospitalised by the illness last week, one of whom required intensive care. </p>
      <p>The HSE’s Assistant National Director of Health Protection, Dr Kevin Kelleher, said the recent upsurge in cases suggested that the annual flu season could arrive within two or three weeks.</p>
      <p>“We’re still at the point where prevention is possible,” Kelleher said.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who’s in the [vulnerable] groups – over 65s or under 65s with medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, or who are being treated for cancer – should get the vaccine.</p>
      <p>“As should pregnant women. They are really quite an important group because [the flu] can be really catastrophic for one or two pregnant women each year.”</p>
      <p>He also urged parents to keep children away from elderly relatives such as their grandparents if they picked up the illness, in order to prevent its spread to more vulnerable individuals.</p>
      <p>The HSE has reminded those with flu-like symptoms to wash their hands and warned that there was no evidence that face-masks were an effective method of containing the illness.</p>
      <p>“If you’re trying to prevent by wearing a mask, it’s your hands picking up viruses that live on surfaces for weeks,” Dr Vida Hamilton, the executive’s National Clinical Advisor said.</p>
      <p>“You pick it up, then you touch your face or you fiddle with your mask, and you’ve exposed yourself to the virus.</p>
      <p>“So in terms of prevention, hand-washing is the most effective method and good infection prevention and control practices.”</p>
      <p>Kelleher added that those afflicted with the flu should sneeze into paper tissues or their elbows and then use alcohol gel to wash their hands to avoid contaminating others.</p>
      <p>“It’s really an important issue every year, this issue of how you don’t spread the flu or any other respiratory virus by the way you deal with it,” he said.</p>
      <p>The HSE also reminded the public that a winter ready checklist was available for vulnerable members of the public <a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/news/newsfeatures/winter-initiative/stay-well/winter-advice-for-patients-with-chronic-conditions/winter-health-check.pdf">on its website</a>.</p>
