      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:41:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:41</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira has spoken out on his future and refused to rule out a January exit.</p>
      <p>Torreira, who opened up on how he preferred life in Italy sparking speculation over his future in the summer, has been tipped to head back to Serie A.</p>
      <p>His agent, Pablo Bentancur, recently suggested a tactical change by Unai Emery to push him into a more advanced role meant he was "no longer at ease" with Napoli and AC Milan linked with a move.</p>
      <p>The Uruguayan, who has started just four of Arsenal's 12 Premier League matches this season, has now addressed his future in north London.</p>
      <p>And although he refused to get drawn on any specific speculation, he admitted he will have to "see what will happen" when the January window opens.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Uruguayan radio station <a href="http://www.sport890.com.uy/2019/11/20/lucas-torreira-no-puedo-hablar-de-otro-equipo-ahora-en-el-periodo-de-pases-se-vera/">Sport860</a> , Torreira said: "Today <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> needs me to be focused.</p>
      <p>"I can’t start talking about another team.</p>
      <p>"I need to be focused and when the transfer window arrives we will see what will happen.</p>
      <p>"I don’t know what can happen in the future."</p>
      <p>The South American also reiterated his desire to play for Argentinian giants Boca Juniors at some stage in his career.</p>

      <p>“I don't know what can happen in the future. But I wish I could play in Boca. It's a dream that I have for what that institution represents,” he added.</p>
      <p>Agent Bentancur did little to dispel rumours of an exit in a recent interview as he discussed his unhappiness at Emery's tactical switch.</p>
      <p>"Anything is possible in football," Bentancur told Radio Marte. "Torreira is happy at Arsenal, although the change in role has not made him happy.</p>
      <p>"It must be said that this year the whole team is not doing well. But I believe Arsenal wants to keep him."</p>
      <p>In a further interview, Bentancur told <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/bentancur-a-cm-milan-torreira-ecco-perche-non-e-andata-in-porto--25745">Calciomercato</a> : "I must say that the change of role has penalised him sharply.</p>
      <p>"He is no longer at ease and we hope that things can change.”</p>
