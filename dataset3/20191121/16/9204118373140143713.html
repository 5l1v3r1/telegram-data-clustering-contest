      <h1>Honeywell to expand production capacity of Spectra PE fibers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:53:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author">Mary Page Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Honeywell (Charlotte, N.C.; <a href="http://www.honeywell.com/">www.honeywell.com</a>) announced that it is increasing production capacity of its proprietary <a href="https://www.packagingcomposites-honeywell.com/spectra/">Spectra</a> fiber to meet the demands of global militaries and law enforcement for high-performing and lightweight armor that provides critical protection against a wide range of threats. Spectra fiber is made from UHMWPE (ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene) using a patented gel-spinning process.</p>
      <p>Spectra fiber, an ultra-strong, yet lightweight fiber, is incorporated into Honeywell’s <a href="https://www.packagingcomposites-honeywell.com/spectra/products/">Spectra Shield</a> technology for use in advanced armor applications. This fiber expansion demonstrates Honeywell’s commitment to boost the supply to meet the growing need for superior protective gear globally.</p>
      <p>“We’re expanding capacity of Spectra fiber by more than 20% to increase supply of our best-in-class ballistic products for helmet, vest and plate manufacturers to support the rigorous performance specifications required by militaries and law enforcement around the world,” said Ken West, vice president and general manager, Packaging &amp; Composites, at Honeywell.</p>
      <p>“Armor solutions using UHMWPE have become the systems of choice, replacing the aramid fiber-based solutions that once dominated the market. This expansion will enable us to continue to deliver next-generation armor for the industry and meet the demand for low-weight solutions that provide the highest protection levels possible.”</p>
      <p>Honeywell’s Spectra Shield portfolio, including the newly introduced <a href="https://www.packagingcomposites-honeywell.cm/spectra/press-releases/honeywell-launches-spectra-shield-6472-for-improved-protection-in-military-helmets-2/">Spectra Shield 6000</a> series, has been widely adopted and proven for the most advanced armor applications. From bullet-resistant vests, breast plates, and helmets, to combat vehicles and military aircraft where lightweight solutions and performance are critical. Honeywell’s Shield technology is also capable of combining a variety of aramid fibers and resins to meet specific performance requirements in soft and hard armor applications.</p>
