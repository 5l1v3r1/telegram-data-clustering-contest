      <h1>Conservative Party Criticised Over 'Fake' Labour Website</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T16:30:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 16:30</time> by <a rel="author">Shabana Arif</a></address>
      <p>The conservatives are in hot water again, this time over a reported Google ad that supposedly hijacked search results.</p>
      <p>The party's <a href="https://twitter.com/Conservatives">Twitter account</a> has been harping on about Labour's manifesto for at least as far back as I can be bothered to scroll, accompanied by the hashtag #CostOfCorbyn. It's even knocked up a website to tell everyone how shit it thinks Labour's proposed policies are, dubbed <a href="https://www.labourmanifesto.co.uk/">Labourmanifesto.co.uk</a>. In the context of its Tweets, it's quite evident that the site has nothing to do with Labour, which would probably shy away from summing up its own manifesto as "no plan for Brexit", "higher taxes", and "two more referendums".</p>
      <p>The landing page makes it abundantly clear too, boldly pronouncing that it's "a website by the conservative party," but the move is being viewed as another underhanded tactic, especially in light of the party's silly buggering this week, when it <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/11/conservatives-twitter-stunt/">changed its branding and username to factcheckUK</a> during the live TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

      <p>In addition to tweeting out the link to the site, the Conservatives reportedly paid for a Google ad that saw its new website about Labour pop up at the top of the search results when googling "Labour," which is naughty. However, entering that into the search engine myself is bringing up <a href="https://action.labour.org.uk/page/content/time-for-real-change">Labour's actual website</a> as the top result. The Conservative's Labour manifesto site isn't present on the first page of results, and how often does anyone bother going beyond that, really?</p>
      <p>What makes it somewhat shady is that the site went live just half an hour before Jeremy Corbyn launched Labour's manifesto, so hijacking the search results is a tad scummy, to say the least, but in this instance, you could argue that anyone under the impression that they were headed to Labour's official site would soon realise that wasn't the case.</p>
      <p>The biggest issue seems to be Google's alleged promotion of the site to top internet searches, like when it used to happily promote sites that charge for free government services over the official sites themselves.</p>
      <p>Just this week, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/20/google-political-ad-policy-facebook-twitter">Google announced</a> that it will no longer be allowing political ads access to tools that allow them to target individuals based on their political ideology, but they can still use location, age, and gender.
