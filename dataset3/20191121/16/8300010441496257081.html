      <p>Billy Haynes, 17, has been hard of hearing since he was born. But growing up, he watched football and had no doubt that one day, he'd play the game. <br/><br/>"Just because we can't hear, doesn't mean we can't do anything if we set our minds to it," said Billy.<br/><br/>With the help of an interpreter at his practices and games, Billy is co-Captain of his high school varsity football team and an inspiration to others both on and off the field.<br/><br/>Billy says he feels like he's surrounded by people who want him to succeed, and says that's how he can handle whatever is thrown his way.<br/><br/>"They don't treat me any different," said Billy. "They treat me like I'm one of their brothers, their family members, just (a) teammate."</p>
