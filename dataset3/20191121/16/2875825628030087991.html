      <h1>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho blasted for poaching members of Lille coaching team</h1>

      <p>Lille manager Christophe Galtier has criticised Jose Mourinho after the new <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> boss poached two members of his coaching team.</p>
      <p>Mourinho moved quickly to appoint his backroom staff, with Joao Sacramento and Nuno Santos joining from Lille as assistant manager and goalkeeping coach, respectively.</p>
      <p>It has now emerged that Lille chief Luis Campos, who was Mourinho's assistant manager at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , is open to taking up a sporting director role with the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>However Galtier has sarcastically praised Mourinho for his conduct in hiring his coaching team - and warned him over any attempts to prise Campos away from the French side.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of Lille's Ligue 1 match against Paris Saint-Germain, he said: "Everyone has their own way of doing things.</p>

      <p>"But it's really classy. Really classy to act like that."</p>
      <p>When asked whether Campos could follow suit, the Lille boss added: "Luis is 200% invested in the project and I don't see a 1000th of a wish to look elsewhere. We're close and looking forward."</p>
      <p>Tottenham also confirmed the arrival of Carlos Lalin as fitness coach, Ricardo Formosinho as tactical analyst and Giovanni Cerra as technical analyst.</p>
      <p>All three worked under Mourinho at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Spurs sent shock waves through the Premier League this week when they followed the surprise news of Mauricio Pochettino's sacking with the swift appointment of the former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss.</p>

      <p>Appearing in front of the media for the first time at Tottenham's Enfield training base, the Portuguese said: "I do it with a bit of sadness, but I have to speak about Mauricio.</p>
      <p>"I have to congratulate him for the work he has done. This club will always be his home. This training ground will always be his training ground. The door will always be open for him.</p>
      <p>"He can come when he wants. When he misses the players, when he misses the people he worked with. The door is always open for him.</p>
      <p>"He will find happiness again. He will find a great club again. He will have a great future."</p>
