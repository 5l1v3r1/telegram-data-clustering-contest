      <h1>Italy’s blighted steel town creates crisis for government</h1>
      <h2>ArcelorMittal pulls out of deal while Five Star is criticised for not shutting plant</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:30+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Davide Ghiglione, Miles Johnson</a></address>
      <p>The cries that greeted Giuseppe Conte when he visited the Ilva steelworks in Taranto — the town’s only employer of any size — were not what a politician normally hears.</p>
      <p>“Close it! Close it!” crowds shouted at Italy’s prime minister this month.</p>
      <p>Stricken by high unemployment, Taranto is also blighted by environmental hazard — its devastated farms and alarming rates of sickness the legacy of living in the shadow of Europe’s largest steel plant. For many residents, the benefits of jobs over health are debatable.</p>
      <p>“Many of the workers in Ilva don’t want to work there, they know it is killing their families. But they feel they have no choice,” said Massimo Battista, a former worker at the plant who now believes it must be “closed, decontaminated and converted”.</p>
      <p>Ilva’s fate has become a national political crisis after the collapse of a deal to bring it into the operations of ArcelorMittal, one of the world’s largest steelmakers. Arcelor, which agreed to take over running Ilva last year, said this month it would walk away, after Italian lawmakers did not extend a plan to give the company legal protection against future environmental liabilities.</p>
      <p>Critics argue that the collapse of the deal is a blow to the government’s credibility with foreign investors, while offering scant comfort to those in Taranto who want the plant closed. Mr Conte’s government is threatening a legal challenge, saying ArcelorMittal is in breach of its contract to take over the plant. If this fails it has said it will prop up Ilva with emergency loans to protect jobs — leaving no clear exit strategy and no sign of another investor to help manage and mitigate the environmental effects of the plant. When Arcelor closed its acquisition it had promised €1.15bn of environmental investments.</p>

      <p>For many local residents, the villains of the piece are the politicians of the ruling Five Star Movement, an anti-establishment force with its strongest political roots in southern Italy. Five Star made its name by pushing its environmental credentials, promising during its years in opposition to close the Ilva plant.</p>
      <p>But in office it has failed to act. After going into government last year in a coalition with the League, Five Star supported the sale of the plant to ArcelorMittal and the legal immunity that the company demanded to take over Ilva. This month that immunity was lifted when senators from Five Star — which is now in coalition with the centre-left Democratic party — amended a broader piece of legislation. It dealt a blow to the authority of Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio, who was in charge when the deal with ArcelorMittal was finalised.</p>
      <p>Vincenzo Fornaro, a farmer in Taranto, believes national political concerns over protecting the Italian steel industry have ignored the devastating effects of pollution on the town’s economy.</p>
      <p>“They promised the closure of the plant. From today on, we won’t vote for them or any other party again,” said Mr Fornaro, who in 2008 had all of his livestock slaughtered after environmental inspectors judged them too contaminated by the Ilva plant’s pollution to be safe for human consumption. “We no longer believe in anyone. We feel tired, angry, disappointed and hopeless.”</p>
      <p>Mr Battista, the former steelworker, joined Five Star in 2015 because of the party’s promise to shut down Ilva. Now, he said, “they have taken us for fools”. He quit the party last year.</p>
      <p>His disillusionment is symptomatic of a wider fall in support for Five Star, which has been forced to make painful adjustments to being in government.</p>
      <p>National support for the party has slumped from 34 per cent in the 2018 general elections to 16 per cent, while support for Matteo Salvini’s anti-migration League, which left the government in August, has surged.</p>

      <p>In Puglia, where Five Star won 45 per cent of the vote in 2018, it won just 26 per cent of the vote in European elections this year — barely ahead of the League, which just two years ago had negligible support in southern Italy.</p>
      <p>Puglia has an unemployment rate of 16 per cent for adults, above Italy’s national average, and Rome is painfully aware of the impact the loss of 8,000 Ilva jobs would have. Some former Ilva workers agree that environmental concerns must be balanced with the need to maintain an important industry.</p>
      <p>“Ilva represents 80 per cent of the city’s economy, and if the plant were to close the families working for the company will have to be helped by the state or they will become a burden to the whole country,” said Emmanuele La Tanza, 76, a retired former IT worker at Ilva.</p>
      <p>But in Taranto many are furious at living next to a steelworks that has resulted in schools being temporarily shut and children being stopped from playing outdoors in certain neighbourhoods. The European Court of Human Rights this year said Italian authorities had failed to protect residents.</p>
      <p>Grazia Parisi, a paediatrician, says rates of cancerous tumours in children aged up to 14 are 50 per cent higher in the city than the regional average. “These are numbers, but I see these numbers in the faces of my patients,” she said from her practice in the centre of Taranto. “I have been working for 20 years in Taranto. I have seen the child who dies aged two, the child dying newborn, the boy who at 14 becomes ill and dies of leukaemia.”</p>

      <p>For Mr Battista, the once radical spirit that attracted him to Five Star has been irreparably damaged. “They came to outside the main gate of the plant, and said they would close it. Then they struck a deal with Salvini and they blame the Democratic Party if the plant is still functioning,” he said. “Politically, they are disappearing from Taranto. They will disappear from Rome too.”</p>
