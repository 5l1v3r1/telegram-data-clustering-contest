      <p>After months of playing hide and seek with the cameras, an adorable photo giving us a first look at <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Neha-Dhupia">Neha Dhupia</a> and Angad Bedi’s one-year-old daughter Mehr’s face has finally been shared online. All thanks go to grandpa and Angad’s father Bishan Bedi for posting the cute family portrait from their ancestral home in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab">Punjab</a>.</p>
      <p>Instead of ringing in little Mehr’s birthday in exotic locations around the globe, Neha and Angad planned a visit to the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Golden-Temple">Golden Temple</a> and to take their little one back to her roots and visit her ancestral home.</p>
      <p>The photo, sees Angad and Neha posing with their little cutie while she sticks her tongue out and waves to the camera.</p>
      <p>Bishan shared the photo with the caption, “MEHR seems to approve of her presence in the dilapidated ‘Haveli’ of her Great GrandParents...Maybe the renovation of the Old Relic is around the corner..!! Thx Fellas for visiting my Birth Place...Guru MEHR Kareh...Love All Always...Hope U all left behind your Youthful Energies..!!”</p>
