      <h1>Hollywood Mocks Democratic Candidates During MSNBC Debate</h1>
      <h2>Hollywood celebrities normally rally enthusiastically behind Democratic politicians. But even they could barely contain their boredom with MSNBC’s Democratic presidential debate, spending the broadcast mocking the candidates with a series of jokes and sarcastic remarks.</h2>

      <p>Ten Democratic candidates <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/11/20/live-updates-democrats-debate-in-georgia/">squared off</a> Wednesday evening from the new Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, with questions coming from an all-female panel of moderators led by MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.</p>
      <p>MSNBC and co-host <i>The Washington Post</i> promised an exciting evening of political drama, but clearly fell short of expectations as none of the candidates stood out or made a lasting impression on viewers.</p>
      <p>Actress-comedian Jane Lynch summed up the anti-climactic mood in a single, sarcastic Tweet: “And how about that lighting? @tylerperry ‘s studio. Top notch.”</p>

      <p>Fellow funny lady Wanda Sykes signaled her boredom by focusing on billionaire candidate Tom Steyer’s apparent dental shortcomings.</p>
      <p>“Steyer needs to take one of his millions and invest it in his teeth.  Ask Joe [Biden] who did his new chompers,” she quipped.</p>

      <p><i>The Daily Show</i> with Trevor Noah also took a shot at Steyer, comparing him to actor Ray Bolger, who played the scarecrow in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.</p>

      <p><i>Star Trek</i> actor George Takei made his feelings about Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) clear when he mocked the iconoclastic candidate’s frequent invocation of the word “Aloha.”</p>
      <p>“Tulsi: Do you know what else “aloha” means? GOODBYE,” the actor tweeted.</p>

      <p><i>Full Frontal</i> with Samantha Bee seized on one of Vice President Joe Biden’s many gaffes on Wednesday, including the unfortunate phrase “<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/11/20/biden-repeatedly-says-punch-it-while-touting-domestic-violence-plan/">punching at it</a>” he used to describe his policy to end violence against women.</p>

      <p>Sarah Silverman said she supported some of the candidates, but saved her most passionate comment for Pete Buttigieg, saying he would look good with a mustache.</p>
      <p>“Mayor Pete would look so hot with a mustache oh crap is that okay to say I say it with total respect for his mind,” Silverman tweeted on Wednesday.</p>
