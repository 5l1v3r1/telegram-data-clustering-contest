      <p>The Congress Working Committee on Thursday reviewed the political scenario in Maharashtra, a day after it held a marathon meeting with the NCP on forming an alliance together with <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shiv-sena/">Shiv Sena</a> to form a government in the state.</p>
      <p>Congress general secretary KC Venugopal told the media after a meeting at party chief <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sonia-gandhi">Sonia Gandhi</a>â€™s 10 Janpath residence that the CWC was briefed on the discussion between NCP and Congress on Wednesday.</p>
