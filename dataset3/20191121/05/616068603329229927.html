      <p>An Indigenous woman interrogated for hours by Kelowna RCMP in 2012, when she was 17 and attempting to report a sexual assault, is going public.</p>
      <p>Aden Withers, who identified as Elicia Withers during the time of the interrogation, is now 25 and is hoping to advocate for other sexual assault victims and indigenous youth.</p>
      <p>"I was victimized by the RCMP," says Withers, who went to Kelowna RCMP after being sexually assaulted by a 20-year-old man.</p>
      <p>Withers says she made the decision to go public with her experience after finding out that 40 per cent of sexual assault cases in Kelowna were deemed unfounded during the <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/269403/mayor-confident-in-rcmp">last two years.</a></p>
      <p>"Canada has a huge issue with racism and rape culture... I had to essentially out myself in order for people to pay attention and I had to release something horrendous and traumatic that happened to the world – and that I just find absolutely disgusting," says Withers.</p>
      <p>Withers went on to explain when she was in the interrogation room she felt confused because she couldn't understand why they were treating her like she was guilty of a crime.</p>
      <p>"For a long time, they (RCMP) had me believing they were going to charge me with public mischief and that I was the one who did something wrong," said Withers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Kelowna/256862/Cop-makes-teen-relive-rape?fbclid=IwAR36Q5GdquEi8edAlJQ8OUJaRjAT9kvl-26btDKZimsfHIdG0_LrHqB_Sr8">Throughout the interrogation,</a> the officer persistently insinuated that Withers was lying about her story.</p>
      <p>Withers says she was faced with an ultimatum – do restorative justice or be charged with public mischief, so she chose to participate in restorative justice.</p>
      <p>"They made me write an apology to the person who sexually assaulted me, to the officer, to my social worker and the community," said Withers.</p>
      <p>Withers says her mental health declined rapidly after the experience with the police.</p>
      <p>"I had my first suicide attempt ... I was 17 and I attempted to throw myself down a flight of very high stairs," said Withers. </p>
      <p>Now, years later, Withers is focused on bettering her mental health through intensive therapy programs and wants to focus on helping indigenous children.</p>
      <p>Withers took legal action against the RCMP and the Ministry of Child and Family Services in November 2018 because of how her case was treated, but cannot comment on the status of the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>She is also an organizer of an 'RCMP rape culture protest' taking place Nov. 23 at 11 a.m., across from the RCMP station on Richter Street.</p>
