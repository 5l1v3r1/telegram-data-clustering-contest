        <figcaption>The Daily Mirror is one of several papers leading with a picture of the duke taken as he left Buckingham Palace on Tuesday. The paper doesn't hold back in its take on how the saga would have played out among the royals , and reports that Prince Andrew has "kissed goodbye" to a £249,000 allowance.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>A sour twist on a classic nursery rhyme from the Metro. The paper focuses on the duke's pledge to help with investigations and a letter from his former private secretary that says he met Epstein years before he claimed in the Newsnight interview.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The i newspaper brands the ordeal a "crisis at the palace". The Queen wanted to "shut down outcry", it reports. It adds that Buckingham Palace declined to comment on whether Prince Andrew will keep his private allowance.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Express says the monarchy has been "badly damaged" by Prince Andrew's association with Epstein, and that the Queen is "saving" it from "further damage" by advising him to step down from public duties.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>The Times quotes royal biographer Robert Lacey as saying: "Nobody will imagine that [the Duke of York] has done this of his own free will." The paper reports that he will step back from more than 200 charity patronages "temporarily" and will still be seen on Buckingham Palace balcony at events such as Trooping the Colour.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>And what about the election? The Guardian alone splashes on Labour's pledge to "[set] aside £75bn over five years to fund the most dramatic increase in the number of council homes since the Second World War". Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's advisers hope to "hold on to long-time Labour voters" by switching the focus of the campaign from Brexit to "bread-and-butter issues", the paper reports.</figcaption>

      <p>It says they took "decisive action" to contain the fallout from Prince Andrew's disastrous TV interview about his friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The paper goes on to say that "not since Edward VIII's abdication in 1936 has any member of the Royal Family so dramatically walked away from their public duties".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10389442/queen-prince-andrew-royal-duties/">The Sun reports</a> that the Queen was said to be "very disappointed" with her son and feels "let down".</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/20/labour-to-unveil-75bn-social-housing-plan-to-build-for-the-many">The Guardian leads</a> on Labour's £75bn manifesto pledge to "tackle Britain's housing crisis".</p>
      <p>The shadow housing secretary, John Healey, tells the paper that the party wants to bring in "a new era of council housing", aiming to build 100,000 homes a year.</p>
      <p>The paper notes the last time that many council houses were built was in 1977.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/thousands-right-buy-homes-could-20925483">The Daily Mirror reports</a> that thousands of homes sold under the Right to Buy scheme could be bought back by councils from private landlords under Labour's plans.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dying-patients-placed-in-suspended-animation-xxtj7cqq2">The Times is among those to report</a> on a ground-breaking medical trial in which severely injured patients were deliberately put in a state of "suspended animation" to give surgeons more time to treat them.</p>
      <p>The paper says the technique involves replacing patients' blood with a chilled saline solution in order to dramatically slow brain activity.</p>
      <p>The study from the University of Maryland did not say whether the patients survived, but doctors hope to prove the method is effective when the results of the trial are published next year.</p>
      <p>"How do you make children's television more educational but still fun?" <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7708951/Hit-1960s-TV-returning-screens-run.html">asks the Daily Mail</a>. "By reviving a classic from the 60s - that's How," it says.</p>
      <p>Those of a certain age may recognise the format from the show "How?" which first aired in 1966 and is to be brought back next year, the paper says. Presenters Fred Dineage, Jack Hargreaves, Jon Miller and Bunty James would take turns posing a question before setting out to answer it.</p>
      <p>The paper says ITV is billing it as the "ultimate children's information show" - and may give Dineage a cameo role.</p>
