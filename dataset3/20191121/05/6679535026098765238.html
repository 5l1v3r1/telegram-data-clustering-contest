      <p>Microsoft is planning to integrate several Google services into Outlook.com, including Google Drive, Google Calendar and Gmail.</p>
      <p>This integration would work in a very similar manner to how it does on the existing Android and iOS Outlook apps, with separate inboxes and side-by-side integration in the calendar, <i>The Verge </i>reported on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The new integration was recently shared on Twitter by user Florian B who tweeted screenshots that show a new feature in Outlook.com allowing users to integrate their Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar into their Outlook.com account.</p>
      <p>As per report, the Google Drive integration supports documents and files from Googleâ€™s service so a user can quickly attach them to Outlook or Gmail emails.</p>
      <p>Right now, it is not clear how many Outlook.com users will get access to this, or when the company will make it available more broadly.</p>
      <p>The feature is only rolling out to Outlook.com Web mail client users.</p>
