      <p>The FGN bond auction by the Debt Management Office which took place on Wednesday was oversubscribed by N102.35bn.</p>
      <p>The DMO offered N150bn from three instruments (five-year, 10-year and 30-year bonds) for N50bn each, to investors at the auction.</p>
      <p>The total subscription received through competitive bids for the instruments at the auction was N252.35bn, indicating a subscription level of 168.23 per cent.</p>
      <p>The trend of investorsâ€™ appetite for the longer tenored instruments continued with subscription of N115.09bn or 230.18 per cent for the 30-year bond.</p>
      <p>Successful bids were allotted at the rate of 12.0000 per cent for the five-year, 12.9300 per cent for the 10-year and 13.3900 per cent for the 30-year bonds.</p>
      <p>The allotment rates indicated a significant decline from the rates at which the bonds were issued at the October 2019 FGN bond auction.</p>
      <p>The total amount allotted for competitive bids was N157.93bn across the three tenors.</p>
      <p>In addition, the sum of N95bn was allotted through non-competitive bids for all the tenors at the same rates as the competitive bids.</p>
      <p>Overall, the sum of N252.93bn was allotted to investors at the auction through competitive and non-competitive bids.</p>
