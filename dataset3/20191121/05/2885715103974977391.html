      <p>As devastating bushfires threaten the sprawling landscapes of Australia, koala bears are at the greatest risk from them. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/world/australias-iconic-koala-threatened-by-deforestation-and-bushfires-6105883/">Hundreds of koalas are feared to have been killed</a> by the fires and many have been injured. One woman is being hailed as a hero after she ran into the burning woods to rescue an injured koala.</p>
      <p>In the video that has gone viral, a koala is seen crossing a road and ending up stranded near the blazing flames. As it tried to run to a nearby tree, it slipped and sustained burns. However, a woman then jumps into action and runs to the koala. She takes off her t-shirt and uses it to briefly cover the koala till she carries it to safety.</p>
      <p>The New South Wales resident, who was identified only as Toni, is seen giving the koala some water to drink before dousing it with some water. The animal is heard whimpering and whining  in pain, as the water is poured on its burn injuries.</p>
      <p>[Disclaimer: Contents of the video are disturbing, viewer discretion is advised.]</p>

      <p>After some time, another man is seen rushing with a blanket to help the injured animal. It was then wrapped in the blanket and brought out from the fire.</p>
      <p>The koala was taken to the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, according to <i>CNN</i>, where it is still being treated for the burns, and its condition is said to be “very serious”.</p>
      <p>Many said the video was “disturbing” and “heartbreaking”, but praised the woman for attempting to rescue the animal while risking her own life.</p>

      <p>“He has been called Ellenborough Lewis (after the woman’s grandchild). He has been treated and is now in the five star accommodation at the Koala Hospital,” the hospital wrote on <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/facebook/">Facebook</a>, which is spearheading the rescue and rehabilitation of the injured koalas.</p>

      <p>The brave rescuer was reunited with the injured male koala, which is believed to be 14-years-old, at the hospital. The woman said it was a “natural instinct” to run into the fire to save the animal. However, the hospital staff called her a “legend”.</p>

      <p>“His feet are completely burnt and he has burns to his chest and stomach. He has been bandaged and given antibiotics but will take a lot of looking after, if he pulls through,” a hospital spokesperson told the news outlet <i>9 News</i>.</p>
      <p>In September this year, the eastern states of New South Wales (NSW) and Queensland experienced the worst fires in recorded history. As many as 350 rare koalas are feared to have died in a blaze in October that raged around 400 kilometers (248 miles) north of Sydney.</p>
      <p>Koalas <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/world/hundreds-of-koalas-may-have-died-in-wildfires-on-australia-east-coast-6094661/">climb high into trees</a> during wildfires and survive if the fire front passes quickly below them.</p>
