      <p>The federation, in one of its social media accounts, thanked all Tanzanians for supporting the team and said the chance to qualify for the continental competition's finals to be hosted by Cameroon is still on.</p>
      <p>“We thank all Tanzanians for supporting Taifa Stars, we still have a chance to qualify, we should continue supporting the team” said the post by TFF secretary general, Wilfred Kidao, and the federation’s president, Wallace Karia.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars were the first to score through skipper Mbwana Samatta through a spot kick the team got on the18th minute.</p>
      <p>Libya equalized through Sanad Al Qourfali on the 68th minute when he converted a penalty and Anis Saltou scored the winning goal for the hosts on the 81st minute.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars' head coach Etienne Ndayiragije is reported to have appealed for patience from domestic soccer stakeholders.</p>
      <p>He said the journey is still on, insisting the team still has four games to play and anything can happen.</p>
      <p>He asked Tanzanians to have faith in the team, promising to work on the shortfalls the squad showcased during the Libya game and the qualifiers' opening clash with Equatorial Guinea.</p>
      <p>All goals Libya registered in the Tuesday match resulted from individual mistakes by Taifa Stars’ defenders.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars were enjoying possession but were failing to cover when attacking, the approach exposed the side's defenders during counter attacks.</p>
      <p>“It is too early to count us out of the race. We still have four games to play to determine our destiny. The game itself was the best teacher and we will address our problems,” the Burundian tactician said.</p>
      <p>According to Confederation of African Football (CAF), Tunisia are the Group J leaders, Libya are placed second while Taifa Stars are third in the four-team group with three points from two matches.</p>
      <p>Equatorial Guinea that have suffered two losses are positioned last in the group.</p>
      <p>The Central Africa nation's squad succumbed to 1-0 defeat to Tunisia in the group’s other clash, which took place at the former's backyard the same day.</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars won their opening game, edging Equatorial Guinea 2-1 at the National Stadium in Dar es Salaam.</p>
      <p>Tanzania’s next match will take place in August next year. The qualifiers will decide the 23 teams to join hosts, Cameroon, at the 2021 AFCON finals.</p>
      <p>Cameroon, the 2017 AFCON winners, are playing in the qualifiers for match practice despite already having an automatic place in the final tournament as hosts.</p>
      <p>The top two teams in each group will qualify, except in Cameroon’s group, where there is just one place up for grabs.</p>
