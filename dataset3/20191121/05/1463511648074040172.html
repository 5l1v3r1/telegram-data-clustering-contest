      <p>Operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Special Intelligence Response Team, Edo State Unit have smashed a gang that allegedly specialised in assisting suspected robbers make tracking of stolen phones impossible for owners and policemen.</p>
      <p>At least four members of the gang, alleged to be software engineers, have been arrested in Edo State.</p>
      <p>The suspects have been identified as Bright Irabor, Benedict Edo, Ernest Ubong and Christian Egbheri.</p>
      <p>They were all rounded up at the Oba Market in Benin City after operatives got information about their activities.</p>
      <p>A police source said: “IRT operatives, led by a Deputy Superintendent of Police, were deployed to Edo State to combat high rate of kidnapping and armed robbery in state.</p>
      <p>“The state has been experiencing difficulty in solving most robbery and kidnapping cases within the state.</p>
      <p>“It was also discovered that phones, which were snatched, suddenly became untraceable as a result of changed IMEI.</p>
      <p>“The operatives made a breakthrough in tracking members of the syndicate and discovered that the members had been assisting bandits to make these phones untraceable.”</p>
      <p>Our reporter gathered that the downfall of the syndicate started after 24-year-old Othuke Samuel, a trader, lost his phone to thieves.</p>
      <p>He was going home after close of business when his phone was snatched.</p>
      <p>Samuel reported the theft of his phone to the police and a manhunt was launched for the thief.</p>
      <p>The thief was later discovered to be Bulama Sani.</p>
      <p>The said Sani was arrested after he went to Samuel’s shop to sell him the same stolen phone.</p>
      <p>Samuel said: “When he brought the phone to my shop, asking me to buy it, I immediately recognised my phone.</p>
      <p>“I then looked at the boy properly.</p>
      <p>“I recognised him.</p>
      <p>“I kept calm and asked him how much he wanted to sell the phone.</p>
      <p>“He said N150,000.</p>
      <p>“I then asked him to wait in my shop that I wanted to get some money from the bank.</p>
      <p>“I left him at the shop and went straight to the IRT operatives.</p>
      <p>“The operatives followed me and arrested him.”</p>
      <p>Sani would later tell the operatives that he used to change the IMEI of stolen phones at the Oba Market, Benin City.</p>
      <p>“He explained that changing the IMEI naturally makes the phones untraceable.</p>
      <p>“He assisted operatives in arresting the software engineers who allegedly used to assist him in changing stolen phones’ IMEI.</p>
      <p>The software engineers arrested during the raid at the Oba market confessed to changing IMEI for criminals at a fee of N1,000 per phone.</p>
      <p>Edo, one of the suspects and a student of University of Benin, said: “I work at Abuma Shopping Complex in Benin City.</p>
      <p>“I repair and flash phones of all kinds.</p>
      <p>“I also change IMEI of phones.</p>
      <p>“I learned the process of changing IMEI of phones from the internet.</p>
      <p>“I’m also aware that it was criminals that were always coming to change IMEI of phones.</p>
      <p>“I had already stopped accepting such jobs before police came to arrest me.”</p>
      <p>Another suspect, Egbheria, said he was aware that changing IMEI of phones was criminal.</p>
      <p>He, however, explained that he engaged in it because the money was attractive.</p>
      <p>He explained that the process of changing a phone IMEI was easy and all that one needed was to access the phone’s software, wipe off the old code and replace it with a new one.</p>
      <p>Egbheria added that those who usually seek them out for such jobs come with more than one phone.</p>
