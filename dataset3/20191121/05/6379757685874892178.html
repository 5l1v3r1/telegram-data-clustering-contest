      <p>Aussems was on the bench as Simba lost 2-1 to KMC FC in an international break friendly match played at Azam Complex in Dar es Salaam on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>He, though, immediately flew out of the country on what the club CEO termed as an ‘e-mail notice to his employers’.</p>
      <p>"I really don't know where the coach went, but we shall have a meeting when he returns and know the way forward. On Monday, he e-mailed me saying he is traveling,’’ Mbatha said.</p>
      <p>Reports doing rounds in social media have it that the Belgium-born tactician went to South Africa for an interview with one of the country’s Premier Soccer League clubs.</p>
      <p>However, Mbatha said they are not aware of that report and termed it unfair speculation.</p>
      <p>“When he is back, it is when we can determine what really happened. Even you can have an emergency. But he did not tell us the nature of the emergency. It is unfair to the coach if we speculate that way, let him come and explain himself,’’ Mbatha added.</p>
      <p>The South African native, who was appointed in August, also denied reports of a fallout between him and the coach since his appointment.</p>
      <p>Mbatha explained that; “I have not been a challenge to him, I have never frustrated him. I have worked well with him.’’</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the embattled Aussems took to social media to clarify his leave and vowed to return strong in the next match against Ruvu Shooting in the Mainland Premier League.</p>
      <p>“I had to leave for two days for personal reasons. I’ll be back tomorrow to prepare for our match against Ruvu and get three more points,’’ he wrote on his personal Twitter feed.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the club has announced the appointment of Mwina Kaduguda as the successor to Swedi Mkwabi as the club's chairman on an interim basis.</p>
      <p>“Following the resignation of Swebi Mkwabi as the chairman of Simba Sports Club, the Board of Directors of Simba Simba Sports Club Limited has appointed Mwina Mohamed Seif Kaduguda to serve as the interim Chairman of Simba Sports Club effectively from November 19, 2019,’’ read part of the press released by the club.</p>
      <p>Salum Abdallah Muhene, popularly known as ‘Try Again’, has been appointed as the vice chairman of the club.</p>
