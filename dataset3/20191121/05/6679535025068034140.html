Lok Sabha passed the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-introduces-bill-to-amend-chit-funds-act-in-lok-sabha/article28823074.ece">Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill</a>.</p>
      <h3>Here are the live updates:</h3>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 6.25 p.m.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha is adjourned for the day. Prakash Javadekar will give his replies on November 22, 2019 to the questions raised in the House.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha| 6.15 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Rajya Sabha is adjourned for the day.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 5.45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Dr. Amar Patnaik of the BJD says that while the penalty for rape and sexual offences against a woman is 7 years, the Transgender Persons Bill accords only 2 years' penalty for sexual violence against transgenders. This violates equal rights for transgenders.</p>
      <p>The House then takes up special mentions.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 5.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Rajya Sabha takes up the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019 for further consideration.</p>
      <p>Vandana Chavan of the NCP says that transgender certificates are a violation of the communities rights as others do not need to declare their identities.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 5.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>Rajendra Agrawal (BJP) is in the chair.</p>
      <p>Meenakshi Lekhi says that nobody expected India to achieve an open defecation-free status but we did it.  Air pollution shall also be solved the same way, she says.</p>
      <p>She also requests for extra time to highlight Delhi's problems.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 4.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Prakash Javadekar, Union Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change points at the drastic difference between the air qualities of the southern States and the Indo-Gangetic belt. The specific geophysical nature of every city needs to be acknwoledged in such cases, he says.</p>
      <p>He also highlights the ruling BJP's efforts to reduce pollution and says more needs to be done.</p>
      <p>The Chair interrupts and reminds Mr. Javadekar of the time.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha| 4.30 p.m.</p>
      <h3>Political differences on pollution need to end, says Shashi Tharoor</h3>
      <p>Shashi Tharoor of the Congress Party says that meetings in 2017 and 2018 of stakeholders had formulated a National Action Plan (NAP). The issue of air pollution has not been given due attention, and even when it gains political traction it is only before and after Deepavali, and restricted to Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi.</p>
      <p>Mr. Tharoor refers to a 2015  <i>New York Times</i> article, in which its India correspondent explains why he is leaving his post prematurely. The article stated that over 44% of schoolchildren in Delhi have irreversible lung damage. The correspondent had a choice to leave, but unfortunately most Indians don't, he says.</p>
      <p>Political differences on the subject of pollution need to end where the stratosphere begins, he argues.</p>
      <p>He refers to China's elaborate NAP which brought down Beijing's air pollution drastically, and says that India can explore what others have done to find a solution instead of 'reinventing the wheel.'</p>
      <p>The present National Clean Air Plan does not have a legal standing and needs to have a status of law. The plan, hence, needs to be ambitious and have clearly outlined targets, he says.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 4.30 p.m.</p>
      <h3>Declare an environmental emergency: Jaya Bachchan</h3>
      <p>Jaya Bachchan (Samajwadi Party) points at the low attendance of ministers for the discussion on pollution and says that this reflects the lack of seriousness for the issue.</p>
      <p>Farmers alone are not responsible for air pollution. India needs to declare an environmental emergency, she argues, to which the Chair responds by saying, "So, every issue in India needs to be dealt on an emergency basis."</p>
      <p>Dr. Ashok Bajpayee of the Bharatiya Janata Party says that pollution cannot be tackled by the government's efforts alone. It needs a public movement and the Parliamentary discussions should reach the masses. Initiatives like Swacch Bharat should be emulated for dealing with pollution too, he says.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>Rajiv Pratap Rudy (BJP) says this is not the first time the House has discussed this. He says the House has to take the next step forward.</p>

      <p>Syed Nasir Hussain (INC) says the government should have taken the issue of stubble-burning a lot more seriously.</p>

      <p>Lok Sabha | 3 p.m.</p>
