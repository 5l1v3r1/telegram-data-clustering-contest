      <h2>Interim U23 boss Mark Kennedy says Wolves' forgotten man Jordan Graham is still in his plans despite his Paris Saint Germain omission.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rosie-swarbrick/" target="_blank">Rosie Swarbrick</a></address>
      <p>Graham officially returned to Wolves this month after his loan at Bulgarian side Lokomotiv Plovdiv ended due to an issue with FIFA clearance.  </p>
      <p>He has not returned to the first-team squad but the 24-year-old has featured for Kennedy's U23 side since his return to England.</p>
      <p>But after he did not feature on the team sheet for Wednesday's 1-1 Premier League International Cup draw with PSG at Molineux Kennedy explained his absence.</p>
      <p>Kennedy said: "I’m Jordan’s biggest fan. If you speak to Scott Sellars (head of academy), Kevin Thelwell (sporting director) and all the academy guys we’re all big, big fans.</p>
      <p>"Jordan’s 24. Jordan is an extremely talented player and I was his coach for two months in the loans group.</p>
      <p>"I cannot speak highly enough about Jordan. But tonight’s game was really around showcasing and giving our immediate U23 squad the experience of that.</p>
      <p>"I spoke to Jordan about that and explained it to him and I have to give him a lot of credit because he was fully supportive of that. </p>
      <p>"But he’ll be in our squad for the Chelsea game on Saturday and I hope he’ll play a major part in that.</p>
      <p>"That’s the only reason why Jordan wasn’t involved tonight. We felt it was really about the younger generation but I have to give Jordan a lot of credit because he was very receptive to that."</p>
      <p>And Kennedy was delighted with the lessons his youngsters learned against Paris Saint Germain.</p>
      <p>PSG’s Alexandre Fressange opened the scoring in the 27th second but Dan Csoka levelled in the 57th minute.</p>
      <p>And Kennedy was delighted with the way his side responded in their first ever competitive European fixture.</p>
      <p>He said: “All the training you do, all the phases of play, you can do all of that but I cannot replicate 6,000 fans at Molineux on a beautiful night.</p>
      <p>“It is impossible to do, it was brilliant for me as a coach and for them because you watch some games, if a goal goes in like that it ends up being a cricket score. The fact they responded so well in the manner they played, I’m really pleased for them.</p>
      <p>“From a learning perspective, I’m not glad it happened (conceding in the 27th second) but from a development coaching perspective, I’m really pleased because our lads were nervous.</p>
      <p>“I could tell before the game, I could tell in the warm-up, we did various things to calm them down.”</p>
