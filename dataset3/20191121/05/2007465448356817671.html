      <h1>Mustang expert thinks Mach E is mockery of pony badge</h1>
      <h2>Petition started asking Ford to rename Mustang Mach E</h2>

      <p>Earlier this week, Ford officially pulled the covers off its new electric crossover â€“ the Mustang Mach E. Clearly, this was a bold move by the blue oval brand.</p>

      <p>We thought it was a good business move, with the current global trend favoring crossovers and EVs. It's looking to go against models like the Audi e-Tron, Jaguar i-Pace, and Tesla's Model X or perhaps more of the upcoming Model Y.</p>

      <p>What's interesting is, Elon Musk hasn't mocked the Mach E, and even congratulated Ford via a Tweet.</p>

      <p>But some fans and enthusiasts were clearly not impressed. Mustang expert Jimmy Dinsmore started a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/ford-motor-company-name-change-mustang-mach-e">petition yesterday asking Ford to rename the Mustang Mach E</a> and has so far gathered over 1,200 people agreeing with him, as of press time.</p>

      <p>According to Dinsmore, "The final design of the Pony emblem faced left while racing horses are viewed facing right. This was because, as Mr. Iacocca put it, 'The Mustang is a wild horse, not a domesticated racer'."</p>
      <p>"The Mustang was intended to go against the flow of the competition. Turning the Mustang into an SUV is not going against the flow," he added.</p>

      <p>We do like the shape of the new Mustang Mach E when we got to view it in the metal on the show floor of the LA Auto Show today. The crossover coupe shape blended well with 'Mustang elements'.</p>
