      <h3>Stan Collymore has warned Tottenham fans that Jose Mourinho may not be the right man for Tottenham Hotspur.</h3>
      <p>Mourinho was officially appointed as the north London club’s new manager on Wednesday morning after the Lilywhites opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach is taking his first job since being sacked by Manchester United in December of last year following the club’s poor start to the new season.</p>
      <p>Spurs fans will be hoping to see Mourinho lead the Lilywhites up the Premier League table, with the north London club currently languishing in 14th place.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have only won three of their opening 12 games in the Premier League to leave them well off the pace in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool FC star Collymore is not sure whether Mourinho is the right man for Spurs, who finished fourth in the Premier League table last season.</p>
      <p>Writing on <a href="https://twitter.com/StanCollymore/status/1197064540632100864">Twitter</a>, Collymore posted: “Amazing how some have bought into “Mourinho the winner” without any regard for how he leaves clubs.</p>
      <p>“Unbalanced, fractured, overspending, soulless. Everything Spurs tried to avoid.</p>
      <p>“Good luck, I like Spurs a lot, but it’s not how this man comes in, it’s how he’ll leave you.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho’s first game in charge will be a trip to the London Stadium to take on West Ham United on Saturday lunchtime.</p>
      <p>They will then return to Champions League action with a home clash against Greek side Olympiakos on Tuesday night.</p>
