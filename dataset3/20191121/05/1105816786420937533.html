      <h1>Uber to test letting riders record trip chats</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:49:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/76/afp/" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p><b>SAN FRANSISCO: </b>Uber said Wednesday plans to test a safety feature that lets passengers and drivers record their conversations and share them with the rideshare service.</p>
      <p>A test run of the option is planned to start next month in Brazil and Mexico, with the potential to expand it beyond those countries.</p>
      <p>“If necessary, this tool can help give us more clarity about what happened inside the vehicle on a trip,”  Uber global security products director Sachin Kansal said in an online post.</p>

      <p>The move comes amid rising concerns over safety and reports of assaults and harassment in rideshare vehicles.</p>
      <p>Recording conversations could help determine facts in a dispute, but could also raise issues around privacy.</p>
      <p>Audio recorded using the feature in the Uber smartphone app is encrypted and left on the handset, where remains unless a rider or driver decides to share it with the California-based company, according to Sachin.</p>

      <p>At the end of a trip, the Uber app will query whether there was a problem during the ride and a person wants to send the audio file.</p>
      <p>The audio can’t be replayed by riders or drivers, according to the company. Uber has software “keys” to unlock encrypted audio that it is given.</p>
