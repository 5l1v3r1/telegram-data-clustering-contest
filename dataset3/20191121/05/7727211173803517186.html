      <p>A Merseyside care home rated ‘inadequate’ left its residents at risk of malnourishment, an inspection revealed.</p>
      <p>The Court, on Barton Road, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/hoylake">Hoylake</a>, was slammed for its ‘unsafe’ staff recruitment, ignorance of resident’s food requirements and a lack of respect for their needs.</p>
      <p>The most worrying finding in the Care Quality Commission (CQC) report read: “People did not always receive a suitable diet and some people did not eat enough to mitigate the risk of becoming malnourished.”</p>

      <p>Food management seemed to be a particular thorn in the care home’s side. Another extract read: “One person had recently experienced weight loss. The person's weight loss had not been picked up.</p>
      <p>“As a result, a referral to dietetic services had not been made in a timely manner.”</p>
      <p>The staff themselves were another major concern. The company’s staff recruitment was “unsafe [and] did not ensure that only fit and proper persons were employed to work in the home.</p>
      <p>“For example, some staff had not completed training in safeguarding, moving and handling, fire awareness, food hygiene, health and safety or dementia care.”</p>
      <p>Such severe negligence is a serious risk to care standards and may explain instances such as this one, the report reads: “We saw that some people routinely walked around the home asking if they could go home or if they were due a visitor.”</p>
      <p>The Court provides residential care for those who require nursing or personal care and is run by Ryding Care Services Ltd.</p>

      <p>Most of the people who reside at the home have dementia.</p>
      <p>An important aspect of any care home is the responsiveness of staff to people’s needs.</p>
      <p>The CQC found The Court wanting in this area also: “People's care plans were reviewed monthly. These reviews were meaningless.</p>
      <p>“They did not show that changes in people's needs were fully considered to ensure the care they received remained responsive and appropriate.”</p>
      <p>People’s choices for their final few days of life were also not respected, the report stated: “People did not have suitable end of life care plans in place to advise staff of their end of life wishes and preferences.”</p>
      <p>The report found some redeeming features to the care home.</p>
      <p>People told the CQC that staff were kind and caring and though the training of staff was questioned, there was a sufficient number of staff on duty.</p>
      <p>But the litany of issues, whether it be food, staff training or respecting people’s needs, mean The Court was rated as inadequate and has been placed in ‘special measures’.</p>
      <p>This means The Court will face another inspection in the next six months.</p>
      <p>If the care home has not sufficiently improved by then, its licence to provide care will be amended or cancelled altogether.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for The Court said: "We are working with a top consultancy firm to ensure we make improvements in any area we are not 100% perfect in at the moment.</p>
      <p>"We are also working closely with social services and have a robust action plan in place.</p>
      <p>"We have been keeping everyone up-to-date with what we are doing."</p>
