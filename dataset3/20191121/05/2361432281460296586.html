      <p>Joel McHale is returning as a guest judge for Fox’s “The Masked Singer” on Wednesday — and bringing with him a wild guess for the identity of one of Season 2’s contestants.</p>
      <p>In a sneak peek from tonight’s episode, which is exclusive to TheWrap, McHale — who was a guest judge on Season 1 of the oddball singing competition — is helping out regular panelists Jenny McCarthy, Robin Thicke, Ken Jeong and Nicole Scherzinger as they try to figure out who is behind The Leopard mask.</p>
      <p>Welp, the “Community” alum thinks all the names they threw out are wrong and offers up this one instead: Alec Baldwin. And he justifies this guess by saying the actor has “like 13 kids” and therefore “he needs the money” from participating in the show.</p>

      <p>Leopard is one of four contestants to compete on tonight’s episode, titled “Mask And You Shall Receive,” which sees the return of the “Smackdown” format from the beginning of the season. During the hour, Flamingo will face off against Leopard and Flower will compete with Rottweiler. At the end, one of those four will be unmasked, bringing us to seven remaining contestants for the season.</p>
