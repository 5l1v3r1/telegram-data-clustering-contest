      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/reebok">Reebok</a> and Japanese label <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nanamica">nanamica</a> have teamed up for a new capsule. Steeped in retro sports heritage, the assemblage encompasses a concise spread of T-shirts, pants, a jacket and a reconstructed take on the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/reebok-club-c">Reebok Club C</a> in two clean colorways.</p>
      <p>Coming in black and white, the low-cut sneakers feature a protective leather strap that covers all the laces. The design was inspired by Reebok’s iconic “Alien Stomper” from the ’80s and was tweaked through nanamica’s distinctive lens. It comes with a smooth navy leather tongue, stamped with a tonal brand tag, while its crisp uppers are met with thin geometric top-stitching. Other details like subtle perforations and suede panels around the toe box round up the minimal uppers, finished off by a creamy beige gum sole.</p>
      <p>The retro theme is continued with the garments in the capsule. One noteworthy piece is the Vector Track Jacket made up of soft corduroy fabrics. Covered mostly in black, the jacket is accented by blue panels around the shoulders in the form of Reebok’s logo. The piece is made with a raised collar, two zipper pockets at the waist and elastic ribbing at the cuffs and hem, rounded off by a small “Reebok” logo embroidery at the left chest — this garment comes with matching corduroy track pants. Rounding up the capsule are two logo tees, boldly emblazoned with “Reebok” and “ナナミカ” (nanamica) branding across the chest.</p>
      <p>The Reebok x nanamica 2019 capsule will be available on November 30 at <a href="https://www.nanamica.com/shopping/products/list.php?category_id=149">nanamica.com</a>, ranging from $45 – $120 USD.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/jjjjound-a-p-c-interaction-collaboration-collection-campaign-apparel-accessories">JJJJOUND and A.P.C. have unveiled their aptly minimal capsule</a>.</p>
