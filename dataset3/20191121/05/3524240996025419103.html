      <p>Udinese defender William Troost-Ekong is pleased with how the Super Eagles played after coming from behind twice to make it two wins in a row in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers, Sports Extra reports.<br/>Nigeria survived a scare for the second match running in their 2021 AFCON, coming from behind before winning 4-2 in Lesotho.<br/>They had previously come from a goal down to beat Benin Republic 2-1 in their first AFCON qualifier at the Godswill Akpabio stadium on November 13.<br/>Victor Osimhen’s brace followed strikes from Alex Iwobi and Samuel Chukwueze despite Masoabi Nkoto’s early goal in the 11th minutes and a late own goal from Chidozie Awaziem.<br/>“I was impressed with the way we handled it,” Troost-Ekong told ESPN as monitored by Sports Extra.<br/>“Both times we stayed calm.<br/>“The boys all have experience now, and I think we believe in our own quality.”<br/>Nigeria have maximum points in Group L. Earlier in this group, Benin, who lost to Nigeria in their opening match, were 1-0 winners over Sierra Leone at home.</p>
