      <h1>From Papiss Cisse's wondergoal to Jonas' sign-off: The Newcastle United goals of the decade</h1>
      <h2>As the end of a turbulent decade at Newcastle United draws to a close, here's a look back at the top 10 goals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>In less than six weeks' time, another turbulent decade at Newcastle United will draw to a close.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> have twice won the Championship title, suffered relegation from the Premier League - a year after narrowly avoiding the drop on the last day - as well as almost qualifying for the Champions League, reaching the quarter-finals of the Europa League and twice reaching the last eight of the League Cup.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have gone through six managers in the last 10 years, each with contrasting fortunes, but there have been great goals and great moments along the way.</p>
      <p>When deciding on a top 10 goals of the decade, the decision was not only made on the quality of the strike, but also its significance and the emotion they evoked.</p>
      <p>We managed to whittle down a top 10 from a 34-goal shortlist and there will more than likely be some other goals we have also forgotten about.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the 10 Newcastle United goals we managed to settle on.</p>

      <h4>Cheick Tiote - Newcastle 4-4 Arsenal, 2011</h4>
      <p>It is arguably the greatest Premier League game of all time and Tiote's late equaliser will always be remembered - both for the drama and the quality of the strike.</p>
      <p>Newcastle were suffering from the hangover of losing top scorer Andy Carroll in a £35million deal to Liverpool just five days earlier.</p>
      <p>Things got even worse when Arsenal romped to a 4-0 lead inside 26 minutes thanks to goals from Theo Walcott, Johan Djourou and a Robin van Persie brace.</p>
      <p>But the game turned in the 50th minute when Abou Diaby saw red for shoving Joey Barton to the floor in an off the ball incident.</p>
      <p>Newcastle took advantage and after two penalties from Joey Barton and a Leon Best strike, they found themselves 4-3 behind.</p>
      <p>With 87 minutes on the clock, Barton floated in a free-kick from the right-hand side. Arsenal managed to head it away only for it to fall into Tiote's path. On the edge of the box, the Ivorian hit the ball first-time unleashing a fierce left-footed volley that spun away from Wojciech Sczeszny and into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>The goal sparked wild scenes inside St James' Park and sealed the most unlikely of comebacks. Tiote sadly passed away in 2017 and is fondly remembered for his five-and-a-half year stay on Tyneside.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Ryan Taylor - Sunderland 0-1 Newcastle, 2011</h4>
      <p>Who would have thought when Ryan Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light in 2011 that Newcastle would not beat their local rivals again for the rest of the decade?</p>
      <p>At the start of the 21st century, Newcastle were largely getting the better of their rivals in the Tyne-Wear derbies and when the two sides met at the start of the 2011/12 campaign, Newcastle had thrashed Sunderland 5-1 in the previous campaign.</p>
      <p>Newcastle had sold popular left-back Jose Enrique to Liverpool that summer, while new signing Davide Santon was not quite fit to play.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article8313264.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS26024891.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Ryan Taylor was asked to deputise at left-back and he made the most of his opportunity. With the game finely poised at 0-0, Taylor whipped a free-kick from the left-hand side over the wall and over the outstretched hand of goalkeeper Simon Mignolet into the top corner of the net.</p>
      <p>It provoked bedlam in the Newcastle away end that had packed into the South Stand and it proved to be not only the winning goal but the catalyst to Alan Pardew's side going on to have a highly successful season.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>Hatem Ben Arfa - Newcastle 2-1 Blackburn, 2012</h4>
      <p>Ben Arfa had joined amid much promise the previous season but a broken leg suffered against Manchester City had kept him out of the side.</p>
      <p>By January 2012, Pardew was trying to ease his star player back into the team and he handed him an opportunity to shine against Blackburn in the third round of the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Arguably the most talented player to don the black-and-white shirt during the last decade, Ben Arfa showcased his natural dribbling ability with a stunning solo goal.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old picked up the ball just inside the Rovers half, slalomed past five Blackburn players before cutting on to his left foot and hammering the ball into the roof of Mark Bunn's net.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>Hatem Ben Arfa - Newcastle 2-0 Bolton, 2012</h4>
      <p>Another one from the Ben Arfa highlight reel and another stunning solo effort.</p>
      <p>Receiving the ball on the halfway line with his back to the Bolton goal, Ben Arfa's first touch was a Cruyff turn which floored the onrushing Sam Ricketts.</p>
      <p>He then skipped past the challenge of Mark Davies, found a way in between Bolton's two centre-halves with a deft dink, before coolly slotting the ball beyond Adam Bogdan to cap a stunning run.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Papiss Cisse - Chelsea 0-2 Newcastle, 2012</h4>
      <p>Another goal from the 2011/12 scrapbook and a goal which was crowned the Premier League's goal of the season.</p>
      <p>Cisse joined Newcastle from Freiburg in a £9.5million deal in January 2012 and was an instant hit.</p>
      <p>Newcastle travelled to Stamford Bridge in May knowing the winner would keep alive their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Cisse produced arguably his best performance in a Newcastle shirt and he put United in the lead with a deadly volley from the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>But if his first goal was good, his second goal was absolutely exceptional.</p>
      <p>Ryan Taylor's hopeful long throw was chested down by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/shola-ameobi">Shola Ameobi</a> on the left touchline. It bounced into the path of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/papiss-cisse">Cisse</a> who swept the ball with the outside of his right foot on the half-volley.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Papiss Cisse in action for Newcastle<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The ball initially looked like it was heading wide of the left post before swirling towards the right hand side of the goal, looping over a helpless Petr Cech.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, Cisse was awarded the Premier League's Goal of the Season award. It was the last of a catalogue of ridiculous strikes during his first four months at the club as he scored 13 goals in his first 12 games.</p>
      <h4>Papiss Cisse - Newcastle 1-0 Anzhi, 2013</h4>
      <p>Newcastle's reward for a brilliant fifth-placed finish in 2011/12 was a place in the 2012/13 Europa League.</p>
      <p>After negotiating their way past Atromitos, Maritimo, Club Brugge, Bordeaux and Metalist Kharkiv, Newcastle faced Russia's big-spending Anzhi in the last 16.</p>
      <p>Newcastle had held out for a 0-0 draw in Russia the week before and headed back to St James' Park looking for the win that would take them into the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Managed by Guus Hiddink and armed with ex-Barcelona and Inter Milan forward Samuel Eto'o, Anzhi posed a threat but couldn't break down Newcastle's resistance.</p>
      <p>With the match deep into stoppage time, it looked destined to go to extra time until Cisse stepped up with a priceless last minute winner.</p>
      <p>Sylvain Marveaux's brilliant delivery from the right-hand side was met by Cisse who headed home expertly to raise the roof off St James' Park.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>A raucous rendition of Status Quo's 'Rockin' All Over the World' rang out across the stadium at full-time and belief was growing that they could go all the way in the competition.</p>
      <p>Newcastle's challenge would end at the quarter-final stage, though, despite a spirited display against Benfica.</p>

      <h4>Yohan Cabaye - Manchester United 0-1 Newcastle, 2013</h4>
      <p>Newcastle headed to Old Trafford full of belief, despite having not won there since 1972.</p>
      <p>Sir Alex Ferguson had left Manchester United in the summer of 2013 and his replacement David Moyes was struggling to put his stamp on the Red Devils' squad.</p>
      <p>The Magpies arrived into the game ahead of Manchester United in the table and despite losing to Swansea in midweek, they came away with a famous win.</p>
      <p>Moussa Sissoko managed to escape his France international team-mate Patrice Evra down the right-hand side. He cut the ball back to Cabaye on the edge of the area, who swept home a lovely finish beyond David De Gea into the bottom left-hand corner.</p>
      <p>In one swoop of his right boot, 41 years of hurt had ended and Newcastle's fans in the corner of Old Trafford were left delirious.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h4>Jonas Gutierrez - Newcastle 2-0 West Ham, 2015</h4>
      <p>Gutierrez's inspirational recovery from testicular cancer got the fairytale ending it deserved when he scored the goal that ensured Newcastle's Premier League survival in 2015.</p>
      <p>The Argentina international was diagnosed with the illness in 2013 and had to go undergo surgery to remove a tumour.</p>
      <p>He would not appear again for Newcastle until February 2015 and he returned to a Magpies side in disarray. In fact, things had gotten so bad that Newcastle headed into their final game of the season against West Ham needing a win to avoid relegation to the Championship.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article15223764.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_FILE-Jonas-Gutierrez-wins-Newcastle-United-discrimination-tribunal-case.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Jonas Gutierrez<cite>(Image: Getty Images Europe)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Gutierrez's cross found Sissoko to head Newcastle into an invaluable lead. Then with 78 minutes on the clock, his moment arrived.</p>
      <p>Picking up a pass from Jack Colback on the left-hand side, Gutierrez cut inside on to his right foot and hit one from around 25 yards out. His strike took a nick off Carl Jenkinson and beyond Adrian into the bottom corner.</p>
      <p>Gutierrez took off his shirt, ran to the bench in celebration and cupped his hands towards the directors' box gesturing towards the ownership.</p>
      <p>He was released by the club the next day but maintains a very strong relationship with Newcastle's fans.</p>

      <h4>Ayoze Perez - Newcastle 3-0 Ipswich, 2016</h4>
      <p>By this point Rafa Benitez had taken charge of Newcastle in the Championship.</p>
      <p>The Magpies had made a brilliant start to the season having been relegated from the Premier League in the previous campaign and welcomed Ipswich to St James' Park in October.</p>
      <p>And they took just 60 seconds to find the net against the Tractor Boys as Perez struck home to round off a passing move that involved touches from all 11 of Newcastle's players.</p>
      <p>The goal was awarded the club's 2016/17 Goal of the Season.</p>
      <figure>

      <h4>Jack Grealish - Aston Villa 1-1 Brighton, 2017</h4>
      <p>We will finish our list with a bit of a left-field entry.</p>
      <p>With three games remaining in the 2016/17 season, Newcastle trailed Championship leaders Brighton by seven points.</p>
      <p>With just nine points to play for it seemed a formality that the league title would be heading to Sussex. But after two wins for Newcastle and two defeats for Brighton, the gap stood at just one point heading into the final day of the season.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article13005255.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Aston-Villa-v-Brighton-Hove-Albion-Sky-Bet-Championship.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Newcastle dispatched Barnsley to secure a 3-0 win at St James' Park but it looked they would have to settle for second place with Brighton leading 1-0 at Aston Villa.</p>
      <p>But in the 89th minute, Grealish drifted in from the left-hand side and struck an effort from 25 yards that looked comfortable for Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale.</p>
      <p>But somehow the ball managed to squirm through the Seagulls goalkeeper to hand Newcastle the Championship title.</p>
      <p>Grealish would party with some of Newcastle's players later that week.</p>
