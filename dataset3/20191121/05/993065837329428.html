      <p>Actor Jon Hamm said he “loved going to work everyday” while shooting his latest film with director Clint Eastwood.</p>
      <p>Eastwood, one of Hollywood’s most enduring stars, is still going strong at the age of 89 and got back in the director’s chair for the drama Richard Jewell.</p>
      <p>The film is based on the true story of a security guard who discovers a bomb at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, only to be wrongly accused of planting it himself.</p>

      <p>It features Paul Walter Hauser in the titular lead role, alongside a star-studded cast including Sam Rockwell, Kathy Bates and Hamm.</p>
      <p>Hamm, best known for playing Don Draper in Mad Men, said four-time Oscar winner Eastwood was an “inspiration”.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the film’s world premiere in Los Angeles, he said: “He’s a legend. The guy has worked for 60 years in the movie industry, if not longer. I don’t know what to say about him other than he’s an inspiration and he’s incredibly talented. I loved going to work everyday.”</p>
      <p>Asked how it was working with Eastwood – who rose to international fame starring in Sergio Leone’s Dollars Trilogy of “Spaghetti Westerns” in the 1960s – Hamm said: “Pretty loose and active and smart and funny and efficient.”</p>

      <p>Richard Jewell’s actions saved lives but the FBI wrongly identified him among the suspects, leading him to be publicly vilified in the press.</p>
      <p>Jewell was cleared after 88 days of intense scrutiny and died of heart failure in 2007 at the age of 44.</p>
      <p>Hamm, speaking at the AFI Fest, said Jewell should have been treated as a national hero.</p>
      <p>“He was tried in the media before any of the facts were in,” Hamm added.</p>
      <p>“And he was wrongfully accused by law enforcement agencies, several law enforcement agencies, that didn’t have their facts correct and (which were) operating under agendas that weren’t right.”</p>
      <p>Hamm warned a similar mistake could happen today, “because information travels even faster now”.</p>
      <p>The film will be released in UK cinemas on January 31, 2020.</p>
