      <p>It's Lumby's time to shine on the small screen.</p>
      <p>The North Okanagan community was visited by Canadian funnyman and CBC <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/programguide/program/still_standing_hd_dv_">Still Standing</a> host Jonny Harris earlier this year as part of his cross-country tour of Canada.</p>
      <p>Still Standing showcases Canada's vast beauty and highlights the country's unique and diverse characters.</p>
      <p>Viewers ride shotgun with Harris on the ultimate cross-country road trip.</p>
      <p>Each week, Harris takes a hilarious and heart-warming journey to find humour in the unlikeliest of places - small towns on the ropes. After immersing himself in the lives of local characters and unearthing the tall tales in these tiny towns, Harris delivers a rousing original stand-up comedy routine - a toast, not a roast - for the whole community.</p>
      <p>And next week the episode Harris shot on Lumby will air at 8 p.m. Nov. 26.</p>
      <p>A synopsis of the episode says: After the closure of all three of its major lumber mills, Lumby lost not only hundreds of jobs and local businesses, but also its sense of identity. Now the town is emerging, hopeful with a diverse economy that includes arts, culture, and a 40-acre grow-op that's hoping to make pot for pets.</p>
