      <p>The Tanzania squad suffered 2-1 defeat at the hands of Libya in the qualifiers’ Group J clash, which took place in Monastir.</p>
      <p>“What happened in the second half? In the first half we did so well, we could have extended our lead then we were overwhelmed in the second half. Libya overpowered us in the second half, after taking the lead they started wasting time and playing for the referee whistle,’’ the Taifa Stars’ striker, who opened the scoring in the match through a penalty kick, said.</p>
      <p>“It was a game that we played well in the first half and then in the second half we were supposed to take control of the proceedings,” he disclosed.</p>
      <p>“When you are playing away from home and leading you are supposed to change tactics especially when the hosts are very aggressive and attacking minded in the second half.”</p>
      <p>He concluded: “We have to improve, we have lost the battle in Tunisia but not the qualification battle.”</p>
      <p>Taifa Stars led 1-0 by the time the interval was reached at Olympique Stadium on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>Despite substitutions by Taifa Stars’ head coach, Etienne Ndayiragije, the Libyans took charge of the second half and managed to equalize on the 67th minute through a controversial penalty.</p>
      <p>Masaud Sabbou managed to slot home the equalizer to set up a tense finale as Tanzania looked lost and overwhelmed by the hosts.</p>
      <p>With 10 minutes left, the Mediterranean Knights completed their comeback when Anis Mohamed struck from close range after he was allowed time and space to take a chance against keeper Juma Kaseja as Taifa Stars’ run of three games without defeat came to an end.</p>
      <p>Libya were reduced to 10 men with about three minutes left following the dismissal of Hamdou Elhouni, but the damage had been done despite Taifa Stars’ late charge for an elusive equalizer.</p>
      <p>After defeating Equatorial Guinea by a solitary goal, Tunisia lead Group J with six points, with Libya and Tanzania both on three points.</p>
      <p>Libya, however, come second on head to head rule, which is used by CAF.</p>
      <p>The 2021AFCON qualifiers take a nine-month break. When the competition resumes in 2020, Tanzania will play back-to-back (home and away) matches against Tunisia on August 31 and September 8.</p>
      <p>The top two teams from 12 groups will qualify for the 24th edition of the African Cup of Nations tournament to be hosted in Cameroon in 2021.</p>
      <p>As the host nation, Cameroon have already secured their spot for the final tournament.</p>
