      <h1>Democratic debate: Candidates discuss their plans to help families</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:35:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:35</time> by <a rel="author">Melanie G. Long</a></address>
      <p>The last two democratic presidential debates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/us/politics/democratic-debate-issues-abortion.html">featured no questions</a> about the gender pay gap, paid parental leave or other economic issues that disproportionately affect women and children.</p>
      <p>So in the Atlanta debate on Nov. 20 – featuring an all-women moderator panel and four female candidates – I was heartened to see that some of these topics got a bit more attention.</p>
      <p>As an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m7ybqvcAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">economist who studies inequality and household economics</a>, I believe issues like these, which so fundamentally affect family outcomes, should be at the heart of our national conversation.</p>
      <p>Here’s a glimpse at how the candidates’ discussion of economic policy engaged with gender, both directly and indirectly, during the debate.</p>
      <h3>Support for paid family leave</h3>
      <p>Few candidates have highlighted their policies on gender equity unprompted by moderators in the debates so far, and this debate was no exception.</p>
      <p>Moderator Ashley Parker asked about parental leave and public child care, directing her first question on the topic to one of the five men on the stage, entrepreneur Andrew Yang.</p>
      <p>Yang, who noted that the U.S. is <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/03/switzerland-ranked-as-best-country-for-womens-rights-oecd/">one of only two countries</a> without paid family leave, briefly signaled his support for such a policy by alluding to <a href="https://heavy.com/news/2019/06/andrew-yang-autistic-son-child/">his own family</a>.</p>
      <p>A more detailed discussion then emerged between Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Kamala Harris of California. Klobuchar said she favored a more restrained three-month paid parental leave policy compared with Harris’ six months. Even at six months, this would be significantly less than what is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/26/u-s-lacks-mandated-paid-parental-leave/">common in many other countries</a>.</p>
      <p>Whether three months or six, a large body of economic research suggests that carefully crafted paid parental leave and childcare policies can <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1177/0486613413487159">increase women’s labor force participation and earnings</a> and <a href="https://theconversation.com/paid-family-leave-is-an-investment-in-public-health-not-a-handout-108323">promote public health</a>.</p>
      <h3>Indirect support for families</h3>
      <p>Some of the candidates noted how their broader progressive policies would indirectly support women and children.</p>
      <p>For example, in defending her wealth tax, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren emphasized that the tax revenue would pay for many policies she supports, including universal childcare and pre-K, while promoting higher pay for the <a href="https://iwpr.org/publications/supply-demand-care-work-immigrants-people-of-color/">women of color who are disproportionately represented among childcare workers</a>.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Yang, in his response on paid family leave, pivoted to his “<a href="https://theconversation.com/andrew-yangs-freedom-dividend-echoes-a-1930s-basic-income-proposal-that-reshaped-social-security-125287">freedom dividend</a>” basic income proposal as a way to support families, including those with parents who stay home with their kids.</p>
      <p>And late in the debate, former Vice President Joe Biden spoke briefly on his role in <a href="https://time.com/5675029/violence-against-women-act-history-biden/">sponsoring the Violence Against Women Act</a>.</p>
      <h3>‘Women’s issues’ and electability</h3>
      <p>There are some reasons these issues aren’t so popular on the campaign trail.</p>
      <p>The only candidate who vigorously promoted parental leave and universal pre-K policies was Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, but she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/us/politics/kirsten-gillibrand-2020-drop-out.html">dropped out</a> after failing to garner strong support. This outcome perhaps explains why the remaining candidates have focused so sparingly on what are sometimes derided as “women’s issues.”</p>
      <p>For women candidates, that’s compounded by concerns that excessive focus on such issues may feed into stereotypes that <a href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/gender-stereotypes-elections-economy-women">women are weak on fiscal issues</a>, threatening their already <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/17/18681964/poll-sexism-electability-2020-warren-trump-harris">lower perceived “electability.”</a></p>
      <p>While candidates may remain wary of making “women’s issues” central to their platforms, gender is likely to continue shaping economic policy in the presidential race.</p>
      <p>Klobuchar alluded to the gendered concerns about electability when asked whether women were held to a higher standard.</p>
      <p>“If you think a woman can’t beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every day,” she said.</p>
