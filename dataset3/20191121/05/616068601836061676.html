      <p>Scam artists are always coming up with new and creative ways to bilk people out of their money.</p>
      <p>And there may be a new Facebook scam making the rounds.</p>
      <p>A Vernon woman was contacted by a close 'friend' of Facebook looking for some financial help.</p>
      <p>But it turned out to be a crypto currency, bitcoin scam and her friend's Facebook profile had been hacked.</p>
      <p>She stopped by a local business and asked how to purchase $5,000 worth of bitcoins.</p>
      <p>The business operator, who asked to remain anonymous, became suspicious and asked the lady a few questions about the transaction and things did not add up.</p>
      <p>The woman was told if she provided $5,000 to the United Nations Democracy Grant Funding program she would get a $50,000 return on her investment.</p>
      <p>“The reason she believed it was because it was a Facebook message from her friend that she knows in real life telling her she sent $8,500 and got back $85,000,” said the store operator who helped the woman. “I questioned the validity of this and asked if she had heard from her friend physically that she had received the money.”</p>
      <p>The store operator did some research of his own and showed the woman the United Nations does not deal in crypto currency and does solicit people for funds.</p>
      <p>It is not uncommon for people to have their Facebook accounts hacked, but the tech-savvy store operator had not heard of this particular scam before.</p>
      <p>“It ended up she did not lose any money. She is a senior citizen that was easily fooled because it was supposedly her friend,” said the store operator.</p>
      <p>Vernon RCMP Const. Jocelyn Noseworthy said scammers are constantly coming up with new ways to separate people from their money.</p>
      <p>Noseworthy said she has not heard of this scam specifically, but was not surprised a new scam was making the rounds.</p>
      <p>The most common scam going around is the CRA scam where a recorded message tells people they will be arrested if they do not send money.</p>
      <p>There are things people can do to protect themselves.</p>
      <p>“Be suspect of anything that is unsolicited. Make sure you check it out and do your due diligence,” said Noseworthy, adding in this specific scam it is a good idea to contact the friend in person.</p>
      <p>People are also reminded to never give out personal information, even at the insistence of the caller.</p>
