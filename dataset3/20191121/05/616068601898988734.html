      <p>Third Space Life charity has announced the appointment of a new executive director.</p>
      <p>Jody Pihl stepped into the role effective Nov. 18, taking over the position from Allie Grey, who has served as executive director for the past three years and is preparing for a family move to Williams Lake.  </p>
      <p>Pihl moved to Kelowna in 1993, where she has been a supporter of various health initiatives, community events and school councils.</p>
      <p>The qualified lawyer graduated with Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of Commerce degrees. For the past 20 years, she has practised civil litigation and wills and estates law in Kelowna, as well as getting involved in various health, community and school initiatives with organizations like the KGH Foundation and Canadian Mental Health Association. </p>
      <p>“Building a mentally healthy community is a personal passion of mine, one that I’ve been contributing to for many years in Kelowna,” says Pihl. “I’m looking forward working alongside the dedicated and skilled team at Third Space to help build awareness of what we do and raise funds so that we can continue to increase the number of people we can serve mental health services to in our community.”</p>
      <p>Third Space founder Ken Stober says the team is grateful to Grey for the relationships she has built in the community and the work she has done with the organization.</p>
      <p>“Our entire team at Third Space is grateful for Allie's leadership these past three years. Third Space has grown year after year, which translates into more people being impacted by the mental health services we provide. Allie has led with excellence, determination and skill to grow and steward our community partners and supporters, and to lead the charity to its most successful year to date.” </p>
