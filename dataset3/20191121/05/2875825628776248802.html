      <h2>The legendary big-name stars will join Jodie Whittaker as she reprises her role as the thirteenth Doctor in the twelve series opener of Doctor Who</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:05:45+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:05</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>TV legends <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stephen-fry">Stephen Fry</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/lenny-henry">Lenny Henry</a> have been confirmed as guest stars in the new series of BBC's hit sci-fi show <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/doctor-who">Doctor Who</a> .</p>
      <p>Two of the UK's biggest stars have reportedly signed up for 'major' roles in the show and will join the thirteenth Doctor Jodie Whittaker for some time-travelling adventures in early 2020.</p>
      <p>While it will be a debut stint for both Sir Lenny, 61, and Stephen, 62, in Doctor Who, the pair's characters are being kept totally under wraps.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of his Doctor Who appearance Stephen Fry said: "Short of being picked for a British space exploration programme and I readily concede that I’m past the age where I’d be considered (if I was ever the right age for such a posting) – then being in an episode of Doctor Who will certainly do as a very sweet second-place excitement."</p>

      <p>Sir Lenny Henry CBE added: “It was absolutely brilliant to be welcomed into the fantastical world of Doctor Who.</p>
      <p>"The nearest I have been to the TARDIS was when I played the Caribbean Doctor in the Lenny Henry Show, so as a life-long (hiding behind the sofa type) Doctor Who fan this is a very special moment for me."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Chris Chibnall, Showrunner spoke about the show's proud decision to welcome the new additions, saying: "Doctor Who is coming back with a bang, with two great British icons in major roles. One of the great joys of Doctor Who is getting to work with actors from your wish list.</p>
      <p>“Stephen and Lenny are two of my absolute favourite actors and to be able to bring them into <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/topic/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a> , in our one of our biggest ever stories to kick off the new series, is an absolute thrill."</p>

      <p>The news of Stephen and Lenny's appearances come after it was revealed there is no festive special planned for the second year running.</p>
      <p>The highly-anticipated 12th series is due to start on New Year’s Day, with one of the biggest episodes in the show’s history.</p>
      <p>Whittaker and her time-travelling pals Bradley Walsh as Graham O’Brien, Tosin Cole as his step grandson Ryan Sinclair and Mandip Gill as Yasmin Khan, will all return for the new 10-part run.</p>
      <p>The second half of the story is then expected to air on January 4, as the series shifts back to its traditional Saturday evening teatime slot.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jodie-whittaker">Jodie Whittaker</a> was last seen in the role in the New Year's Day special entitled Resolution, which saw the Doctor and her friends face off with a Dalek.</p>
      <p>The show, which has just finished filming, has since dropped hints that Whittaker’s second run will feature some 'other' familiar faces.</p>
      <p>The next run is also due to feature <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/doctor-who-series-12-jodie-16180571">returning aliens the Judoon</a> , along with more historical stories, one of which will see the TARDIS crew encounter scientist Mary Shelley.</p>

      <p>Last week BBC also revealed the new writers and directors set to jump aboard the TARDIS for The Doctor's latest adventures, which will bring a new feel to the show.</p>
      <p>A recent rumour teased that Jodie's Time Lord clashes with them in the 19th century in the “darker” new series.</p>
      <p>An insider previously revealed: "This new run is much scarier than Jodie’s first year and will ­definitely put the frighteners on fans. Things are about to get darker for the Doctor."</p>
