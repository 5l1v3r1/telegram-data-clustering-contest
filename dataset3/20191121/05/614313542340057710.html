      <h1>American Marijuana Will Pay You to Smoke Weed</h1>
      <h2>Dream Job Alert: Smoke Weed and Make $36,000 a Year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.askmen.com/authors/christina_majaski" target="_blank">Christina Majaski</a></address>
      <p>It’s no surprise the weed business is booming, with every type of industry turning their eye toward the big green buds and the greenbacks that come with it. But American Marijuana is producing some seriously wild vibes online, man — they’re hiring people to smoke weed and paying a salary to do it. </p>

      <p>In a job listing on their website, <a href="https://americanmarijuana.org/cannabis-dream-job/">American Marijuana</a> made it crystal clear they're not just looking for some super-baked stoners who won’t take the gig seriously.</p>
      <p>“This job is 100% for real and it’s an important job that includes more than just getting paid to smoke weed. If you think that’s the entire scope of the job, then this might not be for you.”</p>
      <p>It seems that American Marijuana prides itself on providing a professional, informed outlook on all things cannabis. The site was started five years ago and has been growing like a weed ever since. </p>
      <p>Although the job is serious, the gig listing doesn't take itself too seriously — even cracking a rap-game joke. American Marijuana does make expectations clear, pushing perpetually stoned tokers out of the running early.</p>
      <p>“If you think you got the guts to smoke weed every day (plays Snoop Dogg song) and get paid doing it, you might just be the guy we need. But DO NOT expect us to hire you just because you can smoke because we’re looking for a guy who also has extensive knowledge of marijuana to educate our readers.”</p>
      <p>To land the gig as the official Cannabis Product Reviewer, there are some requirements you should be aware of before you apply — you have to be 18 years of age and residing in a state (or Canadian province) where cannabis has been legalized. And for some reason, you’ll need to be physically fit and healthy. The successful applicant will receive multiple varieties of flower to sample, as well as different CBD oil formulations. Edibles are also on the table as well as hardware like vaporizers, bongs, and pipes, with unboxing videos being just one line item of the lengthy job description.</p>
      <p>The best part? The pay. Whoever lands this dream job will find themselves bringing down about $36,000 per year, depending on qualifications and related experience. That's a pretty respectable take-home for a job promising free weed in exchange for an honest, educated opinion on … weed.</p>
      <p>If you have what it takes, you can apply on the website. You’ll need to send a bio, resume, headshot or preferably a link to a video about why you’re the guy or gal for the gig, links to social media accounts and at least six street or slang terms for marijuana (just to show you know what you’re talking about.)</p>
