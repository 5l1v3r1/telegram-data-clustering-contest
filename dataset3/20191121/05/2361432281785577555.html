      <h1>Jim Carrey Takes Aim at John Bolton 'Cowardice' in Latest Political Artwork</h1>
      <h2>Carrey shared his latest doodle among the hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Trump</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:25:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/lindsey-ellefson/" target="_blank">Lindsey Ellefson</a></address>
      <p>Former national security adviser and ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton isn’t scheduled to testify during House hearings around the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump — and Jim Carrey thinks that is “just another profile in cowardice.”</p>
      <p>The outspoken actor on Tuesday again used his doodling skills to take on a former member of Trump’s administration. This time, he wrote “BOLTON” down the side along with, “…the tough get going and the weak get silent!”</p>

      <p>Bolton isn’t exactly being silent about everything, of course. He stepped down from his position in the administration in September and by early November, the Associated Press was reporting he had signed a book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster worth approximately $2 million.</p>
      <p>The title, subject and release date of the book are not known and no other details have been made public. With the deal, Bolton will become the third person to parlay a Trump administration job into a lucrative book contract.</p>
      <p>Other former ambassadors, however, are testifying this month. Wednesday was the fourth day of hearings in Trump’s impeachment inquiry and, in fact, Bolton’s name was mentioned by Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland Wednesday as someone who “knew what we were doing and why” when it came to Trump’s dealings in Ukraine.</p>
