      <p>It is an unfortunate but natural urge to seek instant gratification. We need to see results today and are not generally interested in the idea of long-term goals however lofty.</p>
      <p>Over the decades, Kenya has had many long-term strategic visions, including Vision 2030.<br/>However, that is over a decade away and many feel that the pace of progress is too slow to intimately recognise.</p>
      <p>The concept behind Vision 2030, launched in 2008 by then President Mwai Kibaki, was for Kenya to become “a globally competitive and prosperous country with a high quality of life by 2030”, and to be transformed into “a newly-industrialising, middle income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment”.<br/>These are inspiring words but leave many asking what they actually mean.<br/>What exactly will Kenya look like in ten years?</p>
      <p>Perhaps these were the words of a politician who could promise something that they knew they would never have to realise, because it is far beyond their maximum term of office and their political lifespan.<br/>Nevertheless, over the last few years we have been hearing many promises from our current President, Uhuru Kenyatta.<br/>Uhuru has talked about the lofty goals of his Big Four Agenda, the war against corruption and constitutional reform.</p>
      <p>Unlike his predecessor, Uhuru is not throwing out lofty goals to be realised sometime in the long distant future.<br/>He has gone the opposite way. First, he sews unity and then he releases his plans, as he has done in the Building Bridges Initiative borne out the handshake with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.</p>

      <p>Perhaps because of our history, few take our leaders at their words anymore, but we should.<br/>Uhuru has promised many times in recent years that under his watch, every Kenyan home will be connected to the electricity grid. While some have scoffed at that, the experts think otherwise.</p>
      <p>A recently released report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), a Paris-based intergovernmental organisation that provides policy advice on energy, has stated that Uhuru will actually reach his goal.<br/>“If Kenya keeps on with its current pathway, we project full access by 2022,” said Kieran McNamara, an analyst at the IEA.<br/>Just to give this a frame of reference, there is only one other country in Africa expected to reach universal electricity coverage and that is Ethiopia, many years later than Kenya.</p>
      <p>Likewise, in the telecommunications industry and internet connection, Kenya is exceeding all expectations, except Uhuru’s, who predicted and set a plan of action to ensure that all Kenyans will be connected in the coming years.<br/>According to international research, the amount of data subscriptions in Kenya stands at 46.8 million, meaning almost the entire population.<br/>Finally, while some have tried to belittle Uhuru’s war on corruption, those that look at this from a comparative and detailed viewpoint have given high praise to his strategy and its effectiveness.</p>
      <p>On a recent visit to the country, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Director for African Department, Mr Abebe Selassie commended Uhuru for spearheading the war against corruption, noting that Kenya is on the right path.<br/>Unbelievable as it might seem, according to international experts, Uhuru is actually on the right path to obtaining his lofty goals, some ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Of course, there is still much to be done, but for a president in his final term with no possibility of reelection to be planning for the future of the nation demonstrates that his work is largely devoid of political considerations. He is governing with the best of intentions for Kenya and the Kenyan people.</p>
      <p>For too many years, our leaders have talked of great visions, reforms and plans, usually so far in the future they might as well have been a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow.<br/>Rome, as the saying goes, was not built in a day.</p>
      <p>However, Uhuru’s Kenya is being built up on many levels and while it was not his plan and with far fewer years, our president might just be the person to bring us to the promised middle income and prosperous nation status.<br/>It just shows that big dreams can actually become a reality in Kenya.</p>
