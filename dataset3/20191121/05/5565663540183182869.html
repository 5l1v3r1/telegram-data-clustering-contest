      <p>MDC leader Nelson dispatched Bishop Nehemiah Mutendi of the Zion Christian Church (ZCC) to meet President Emmerson Mnangagwa and indicate that he is willing to sit with him and dialogue. <br/><br/>This was revealed by ZANU PF National Spokesperson Ambassador Simon Khaya Moyo who told state media that, "The President is ready to talk to anyone. I understand the MDC leader met with Bishop Nehemiah Mutendi of the Zion Christian Church (ZCC).<br/><br/>"Chamisa told Bishop Mutendi that MDC-A was willing to talk to President Mnangagwa anytime. He must do a follow up with the envoy. I hope that is the right thing to do."<br/><br/>Chamisa has refused to join POLAD the platform that brings together all political parties that contested Presidential elections in the 2018 plebiscite.<br/><br/>Delivering his Hope of the Nation Address on Wednesday Chamisa said that he wanted a transitional authorityÂ  to prepare comprehensive reforms that would usher in a new dispensation.<br/><br/>"We have to come together to find the definition of our problems. We are appealing to SADC to call Zanu-PF and MDC to engage each other for the national cause. The main show should be between Zanu-PF and MDC, but it should be done outside the Political Actors Dialogue (POLAD). We are committed to dialogue outside POLAD."<br/><br/>South African Minister of International Relations Naledi Pandor said South Africa is ready to assist in the mediation process if it is invited to do so. <br/><br/>After the 2008 elections, SADC MANDATED South to mediate between MDC and ZANU PF leading to the GNU that ended in 2013. <br/><br/>ZANU PF has refused to meet Chamisa outside POLAD.</p>
