      <h1>Move Over, Steve Jobs. A New Generation of Founders Is Following the 'Gospel of Bezos' Instead</h1>
      <h2>Amazon executives are leaving to launch their own startups--and their leadership tactics are eerily similar to those of Jeff Bezos.</h2>

      <p>If you poke around some startup circles, you'll notice a new generation of founders following a certain credo. Among some of its tenets:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make decisions based on data</li>
        <li>Circulate <a href="https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/jeff-bezos-bans-powerpoint-in-meetings-his-replacement-is-brilliant.html">six-page "narrative memos" to be read in silence</a> at the beginning of meetings (no PowerPoints!)</li>
        <li>Keep teams small enough that two pizzas are sufficient for team dinners</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This is but a small sliver of the gospel of Jeff Bezos, and according to a new report, Amazon is effectively churning out a flock of founders spreading it far and wide. On Wednesday, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-is-americas-ceo-factory-11574263777">highlighted a series of former Amazon executives</a> who left the e-commerce giant to found their own startups. Many of the businesses--which include household names like Hulu and lesser-known ventures like home-maintenance company Latchel--have gone so far as to blatantly appropriate Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles">14 leadership principles</a>, which emphasize scrappiness, discipline, and constant change.</p>
      <p>They're not adopting all things Bezos. Particularly absent is Amazon's cutthroat culture, which many seemingly want to leave behind. Still, the similarities in their strategies are striking--both to each other and to Bezos himself.</p>
      <p>The trend has two apparent explanations. First: Amazon's management principles are deeply ingrained in every executive's head. One former vice president, Laura Orvidas, found herself saying phrases to her children like "Honey, really good bias for action." Second: Amazon's top leaders are so long-tenured that the company's rising stars often begin to see more opportunity in entrepreneurship rather than waiting for promotions that may never come.</p>
      <p>Thus, Bezos has created a CEO factory that rivals few others. While the <i>Journal </i>draws a comparison between Amazon and General Electric in its heyday, it feels like an inadequate comparison: GE's execs arguably are better known for becoming high-profile CEOs of large companies, not launching their own companies. Alphabet's X Development facility has generated plenty of founders, but the common thread is usually the "moonshot" idea behind the new company's technology, rather than any set of core management tenets.</p>
      <p>Apple's Steve Jobs cut a massively inspirational figure, but I'd argue that his cult of personality didn't generate such a complete operational philosophy for other startups to follow. Even the PayPal Mafia--a group of former PayPal employees who went on to found companies like LinkedIn, Tesla, YouTube, and Yelp--is an imperfect comparison. While those founders were undeniably influenced by their experiences at PayPal, much of their shared success has been due to the <a href="https://www.inc.com/thompson-wall/what-it-takes-to-replicate-the-paypal-mafias-success.html">trust and support they've given each other</a> since leaving.</p>
      <p>It's hard to predict the future impact of these Bezos-inspired startups, but if they do well, you'll probably see even more founders preaching this gospel in the years to come. The trend might even inspire a new entrepreneurial path: Go to college, get a job at Amazon (easy, right?), rise through the ranks, stay long enough to learn the gospel (and perhaps pay off your student loans), follow your startup dreams.</p>
      <p>Then you, too, might have children you'll praise for their biases for action one day.</p>
