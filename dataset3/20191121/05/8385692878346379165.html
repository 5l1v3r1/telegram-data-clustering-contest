      <p>Best Buy's new "Beat the Rush" sale has <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Black Friday prices</a> a week early, on a number of products including this Samsung 65-inch Q60 QLED TV. Allowing you to save $200 and get it for just $999.</p>
      <p>But you'd better hurry as this sale ends Saturday, November 23.</p>
      <p>This TV from Samsung is one of the best you can get. It's part of the Q60 series, which is a more high-end QLED TV from the company, and it offers some really great features.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Of course, it has that amazing looking display, thanks to it being QLED. It has many of the benefits of OLED, but without the screen burn-in that OLED suffers from. So you're still getting some deep blacks on this QLED TV. As well as some really crisp colors.</p>
      <p>It will upscale non-4K content to 4K, so you will definitely see a difference even when watching content that is in 1080p. Which is always a good thing these days.</p>
      <p>Now inside the Q60, Samsung has its own software running the show. It's Tizen, similar to its wearables. But on TVs it is a bit different. It does have all of the apps that you'd come to expect from a Smart TV in 2019. That includes YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, Amazon Prime Video, and much more, so no matter what service you prefer to use, it'll all be available on this TV.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Samsung has included four HDMI ports on the Q60, as well as two USB ports. There's also the usual array of optical, composite and ethernet ports available too.</p>
      <p>All of this for just $999, it's really a great deal. If you're looking for a new TV for your entertainment center, then this is definitely the one to get.</p>
