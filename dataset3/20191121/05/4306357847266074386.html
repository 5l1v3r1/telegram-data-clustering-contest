      <h3>Michael Owen is backing West Ham United to beat Tottenham Hotspur at the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon.</h3>
      <p>Spurs have made a disappointing start to the Premier League season despite reaching the Champions League final for the first time last term.</p>
      <p>Tottenham lost 2-0 to Liverpool FC in the Madrid showpiece and they haven’t recovered after a run of poor results in the English top flight.</p>
      <p>Spurs made the surprise decision to sack Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night and replace him with Jose Mourinho ahead of their trip to bitter London rivals West Ham this weekend.</p>
      <p>Mourinho will be looking to claim three points in his first game in charge when Spurs make the short trip across the English capital to West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>England legend Owen is backing West Ham to beat Tottenham at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>“West Ham have lost four of their last five league games while Spurs have their lowest points tally (14) after 12 league games for over a decade,” Owen told <i>BetVictor</i>.</p>
      <p>“This could not be described as a game between two inform-sides!</p>
      <p>“Manuel Pellegrini received a vote of confidence from the Hammers board after their latest defeat at Turf Moor and I think that faith will be rewarded back at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>“Spurs, despite their heavy defeat to Bayern Munich, have reserved their best performances for the Champions League of late and I feel the hosts will edge what promises to be a hugely entertaining London derby.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham are in 14th position in the Premier League table and 11 points adrift of Manchester City, who occupy fourth position in the league standings.</p>
      <p>The Champions League runners-up are a point ahead of West Ham ahead of the clash at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>West Ham have failed to secure a win in their last six games in the English top flight.</p>
