      <h1>Drivers fume as black Audi blocks pavement in latest example of dangerous parking</h1>
      <h2>The driver was targeted in the latest crackdown by Merseyside Police</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T05:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/nick-tyrrell/" target="_blank">Nick Tyrrell</a></address>
      <p>People have vented their fury at yet another example of selfish and dangerous parking after photos posted by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> showed an Audi taking up almost an entire pavement just metres from the entrance to a shop.</p>
      <p>Merseyside Road Safety Partnership, which is run by the police, posted a picture on Twitter of the incident, which they said had led to a punishment for the driver.</p>
      <p>It's the latest example of potentially dangerous parking in the city and follows a backlash against a "rich and shameless" driver who parked on a city centre pavement.</p>
      <p>Pavement parking has been a longstanding and worsening issue in parts of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/">Merseyside</a>, with parents complaining of particularly bad cases outside schools in the region.</p>

      <p>In some areas of the city where roads are narrow it can force people in wheelchairs or with prams on to the road to try to get around the parked car.</p>
      <p>The  post on Merseyside Road Safety Partnership's Twitter account this morning showed a car in an unidentified area of our region parked across a pavement, taking up most of its width.</p>
      <p>The post read: "We had this corner fed back to us by you as a pavement parking hotspot. We were able to see this in person for ourselves and action accordingly. #YouAskedWeDid #CommunityFirst #MRSP #RoadSafetyWeek"</p>
      <p>The action taken against the Audi driver is part of a bigger "day of action" being taken by Merseyside Roads Safety Partnership to highlight the issue.</p>

      <p>People replying to the tweet on Twitter praised the action taken against the driver.</p>
      <p>Politicians across our region regularly complain about the issue and many have lobbied government to give our region more power to tackle the issue.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year a parliamentary committee recommended central government give councils outside London more powers to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/pavement-parking-still-huge-problem-16901620">enforce directly against pavement parking</a>.</p>
      <p>The report, from the House of Commons Transport Committee, said: "We are deeply concerned that the government has failed to act on this issue, despite long-standing promises to do so.</p>

      <p>"This is a thorny problem that may be difficult to resolve to the satisfaction of all, but the Government's inaction has left communities blighted by unsightly and obstructive pavement parking and individuals afraid or unable to leave their homes or safely navigate the streets.</p>
      <p>"In the long term we believe the government should ban pavement parking across England - as is already the case in London. Local authorities could create exemptions if they choose to do so, but drivers would know that unless it was expressly permitted it was illegal to park their car on the pavement."</p>
