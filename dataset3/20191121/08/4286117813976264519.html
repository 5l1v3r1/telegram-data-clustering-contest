      <p>The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) has postponed the launch of PSLV-C47 that will be carrying Cartosat-3. The launch was scheduled on November 25 at 9.28 am but has now been rescheduled to 9.28 am on November 27.</p>
      <p>Cartosat-3 will be launched from the second launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre SHAR, Sriharikota. <br/>Isro, however, has so far not given any reasons why it has postponed Cartosat-3's launch.</p>

      <p>Besides launching Cartosat-3, the PSLV-C47 launch vehicle will also launch 12 nanosatellites of the US.<br/>In an earlier tweet, Isro had said the launch will take place on November 25 "subject to weather conditions".<br/>Space enthusiasts can register themselves to witness the launch of Cartosat-3 from the Launch View Gallery at Sriharikota. The registration opened from 8 am on November 20.</p>

        <b>What is Cartosat-3?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cartosat-3 is an earth imaging and mapping satellite developed by Isro. The Cartosat-3 is a "third generation agile advanced satellite" having high resolution imaging capability, Isro said.</p>
      <p>The satellite would be placed in an orbit of 509 km at an inclination of 97.5 degree.</p>
      <p>PSLV-C47 is the 21st flight of PSLV in 'XL' configuration (with 6 solid strap-on motors). PSLV-C47 would also carry 13 commercial nano satellites from the US as part of commercial arrangement with NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), Department of Space.</p>
      <p>This would be Isro's 74th launch vehicle mission from SDSC SHAR, Sriharikota.</p>
