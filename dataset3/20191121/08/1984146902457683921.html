      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:44:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author">Kieran Murray</a></address>
      <p>Former Queen of the Jungle  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/scarlett-moffatt">Scarlett Moffatt</a> has backed ­Jacqueline Jossa to win the show.</p>
      <p>Former EastEnder Jacqueline, 27, is the joint 7/2 bookmakers’ favourite as fans praised her bravery in Tuesday’s trial facing spiders, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/scarlett-moffatt-backs-im-celebs-20923804">the Mirror reports.</a></p>
      <p>And on Wednesday's show, she earned more praise after talking about her weight battle and how she would love to be a size eight.</p>
      <p>Scarlett, 29, said: “Jacqueline will easily be in the top three and she’ll have a really good chance of being Queen of the Jungle.</p>
      <p>"I’ve met her a few times and we really hit if off and I think she has real star quality.</p>
      <p>“She is genuinely a lovely person and that will shine through because when you are hungry and you are covered in bugs and you stink, that is when you are your true self.</p>
      <p>“She has little children and she is a great mum.</p>
      <p>"I like the fact she said it was the first thing she has done for herself and now is the time for her to shine being away from home.”</p>
      <p>The County Durham lass said the ITV show was a perfect antidote to the bad times back in Britain, adding: “It’s hard at the moment with Brexit. That is why I love shows like I’m A Celeb.”</p>
      <p>Scarlett also showed no signs of holding a grudge against Ant and Dec after she was <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/scarlett-moffatt-saturday-night-takeaway-17278377">dropped from their Saturday Night Takeaway.</a></p>
      <p>The former Gogglebox star said: “I feel like I was really lucky to work with two of the best people.”</p>
