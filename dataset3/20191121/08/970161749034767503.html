      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> wants <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid next summer, according to reports in Spain.</p>
      <p>Mourinho wanted Bale during his time as Manchester United manager in the summer of 2017 but the Wales international remained at the Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>However, the 30-year-old could be offloaded at the end of this season as he remains out of favour with Zinedine Zidane, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/real-madrid-fans-demand-gareth-bale-sold-poses-controversial-wales-flag-11185192/">while his decision to hold up a Wales flag which included the slogan ‘Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that Order.’ earlier this week has angered Madrid fans</a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://as.com/futbol/2019/11/20/primera/1574266157_036224.html">AS</a>, Mourinho already views Bale as a potential signing next summer as he looks to revamp his Tottenham squad.</p>

      <p>The report also claims that Mourinho remains a huge admirer of Bale and even told Madrid’s hierarchy earlier this season that he believes the forward still has more to offer and could be a key player for the team.</p>

      <p>Bale’s entourage have also reportedly ruled out the prospect of Bale leaving in the upcoming January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Madrid are open to offers for Bale after they blocked his move to the Chinese Super League in the summer.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former Real Madrid president Ramon Calderon has hit out at Bale for posing with his Wales flag earlier this week.</p>
      <p>‘It’s going to difficult for Bale now because it was very childish of him to pose behind that banner,’ Calderon said in an interview with <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1395322/2019/11/21/gareth-bale-was-childish-for-posing-with-golf-banner-and-should-leave-for-spurs-not-china-says-former-real-madrid-president-calderon/">The Athletic</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Fans are very angry because of course they didn’t like that, bearing in mind he has hardly played for the team this season then he goes off on international duty with Wales and plays in two matches. It’s a difficult situation for Zidane and he won’t be happy with Bale for posing with that banner.</p>
      <p>‘Bale hasn’t done himself any favours with this. He’s adding fuel to the fire and it’s going to be difficult for Zidane to include him in the starting line-up and also the bench.’</p>
