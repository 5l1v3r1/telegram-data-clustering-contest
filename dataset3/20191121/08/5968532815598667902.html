      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-9-pureview-review-962171/">Nokia 9 PureView</a> was HMD’s high-end phone for the first half of 2019, but it wasn’t quite perfect. Between the older flagship processor and laggy camera performance, it didn’t make the best first impression.</p>
      <p>In any event, the Nokia flagship is now available at the <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74660X1524607&amp;xcust=hadlee.simons&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1457827-REG%2Fnokia_11aopl11a01_nokia_9_ta_1082_pureview.html%2Fspecs">heavily discounted price of $380</a> via B&amp;H Photo. This is $320 off the regular price of $699, and $220 off the promotional launch price ($599).</p>
      <p>This discounted price is more in line with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/cheap-android-phones-269520/">mid-range phones</a> in the US, such as the <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-3a-review-986460/">Pixel 3a</a> series, and you’re getting a lot for $380.</p>
      <h3>Nokia 9 PureView revisited</h3>
      <p>There’s the older but still powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of fixed storage, a 3,320mAh battery, and a 6-inch QHD+ OLED screen. You’ve also got <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/phones-with-wireless-charging-848173/">wireless charging</a> and <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/best-waterproof-phones-718588/">water resistance</a>, but the penta-lens rear camera combination is the real selling point here.</p>
      <p>The Nokia 9 PureView packs five 12MP rear cameras, featuring three monochrome sensors and two RGB cameras. These sensors work in tandem to produce shots with high dynamic range. These pictures also have far more depth layers than other devices, enabling more accurate depth effects. </p>
      <p>Our own Eric Zeman thought camera performance was “uneven at best” in his <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-9-pureview-review-962171/">Nokia 9 PureView review</a>. Eric said picture quality varied between excellent and mediocre, and noted that the camera’s app’s speed was painfully slow as well. </p>
      <p>HMD has since issued updates to address the camera performance, but Eric still thought these aspects needed improving. Nevertheless, if you like the idea of a different take on the multi-camera smartphone, then the Nokia flagship might be up your alley.</p>
