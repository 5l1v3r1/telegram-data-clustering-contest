        <b>Health insurance is set to cost more in the coming year, with a report estimating increases of more almost four percent from January 1st, 2020.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This represents a bigger increase than was seen in either of the past two years, where costs went up by 2.9 percent and 2.7 percent in 2017 and 2018 respectively. </p>
      <p>The estimated increase (3.6 percent) is largely due to Switzerland’s ageing population and rises in the average nominal wage across the country. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://kof.ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/media/press-releases/2019/11/kof-healthcare-expenditure-forecast-rising-wages-are-pushing-up-healthcare-spending.html">report</a> was completed by Switzerland’s Economic Institute, which completes bi-annual studies into health insurance costs in Switzerland.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite the increases, the Institute says that the figures show policy measures to reduce the increases have worked - as the costs were originally predicted to be higher next year. </p>
      <p>As we discussed <a href="https://www.thelocal.ch/20191010/where-the-big-five-swiss-parties-stand-on-major-election-issues-affecting-internationals">in our report into the Swiss political parties and their policy platforms</a> ahead of the October 2019 election, healthcare costs were a major issue for residents of Switzerland. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Three of the parties - the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats and the Greens - all supported various measures which would prevent increases in healthcare costs, including a 'cost brake' which would peg health insurance to particular economic metrics to control the rise. </p>
