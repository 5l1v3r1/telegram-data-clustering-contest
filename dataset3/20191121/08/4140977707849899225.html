          <p>During the first day of the first Test of the ongoing Pakistan’s tour of Australia in Brisbane, Australia fast bowler Mitchell Starc bowled an unplayable yorker to Pakistan spinner Yasir Shah.</p>
          <p>It all happened on the fourth delivery of the 81st over when Yasir didn’t have any answer in front of Starc’s in-swinging yorker. The expression on the batsman’s face after getting out had more or less summed up him being surprised by the delivery.</p>

                      <p>While a 75-run opening partnership between Shan Masood (27) and Azhar Ali (39) laid the foundation for Pakistan, them losing five wickets for 19 runs saw them not banking on the initial advantage.</p>
                      <p>Starc, who was on a hat-trick in the same over he dismissed Yasir, registered bowling figures of 18.2-5-52-4 to dismiss the opposition by stumps. Known for dismissing lower-order batsmen, Starc stool tall on his potential as he sent back Yasir, Shaheen Afridi (0) and Naseem Shah (7) with the second new ball.</p>
