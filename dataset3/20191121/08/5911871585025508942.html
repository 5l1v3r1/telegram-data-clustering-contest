      <p>The Floria Sigismondi-directed adaptation of Henry James’ <i>The Turn Of The Screw</i> — called <i>The Turning</i> — is coming to theaters in January and it’s getting what looks to be a pretty sick soundtrack to go along with it. Sigismondi has a long history of directing some pretty great music videos, so that might have something to do with it. She also directed the underrated 2010 biopic <i>The Runaways</i>.</p>
      <p><i>The Turning</i> soundtrack will feature new or previously unreleased songs by Courtney Love, Mitski, Kim Gordon, Kali Uchis, Alice Glass, Soccer Mommy, Warpaint, Empress Of, Vagabon, MUNA, Cherry Glazer, the Kills’ Alison Mosshart, and more. It also sees Finn Wolfhard — who stars in the movie alongside Mackenzie Davis and Brooklynn Prince — debuting his new post-Calpurnia band, the Aubreys. And it includes selections from the score, which was done by Lawrence Rothman, who Sigismondi approached after envisioning music for the film inspired by ’90s rock music.</p>
      <p>The first song we’re hearing from it is an original by Courtney Love called “Mother.” Here’s what she had to say about it in a statement:</p>
      <blockquote>I read <i>The Turn Of The Screw</i> as a kid, so it’s a genuine privilege to have had the opportunity to work with the genius that is Floria Sigismondi and Lawrence Rothman on this soundtrack -– especially as I’m alongside so many other fantastic female artists I respect. I’ve long admired her work, particularly <i>The Runaways</i> and the Marilyn Manson videos. Floria and Lawrence had a clear vision on what they wanted to achieve and it was an honor to be invited into their studio and to become a part of it.</blockquote>
