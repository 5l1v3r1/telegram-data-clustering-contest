      <h1>Emerging and Developing Economies Less Prepared Now for a Deeper Downturn</h1>

      <p>Emerging and developing economies are less well positioned today to withstand a deeper global downturn, should it occur, than they were before the 2009 global recession, although they now have more resilient policy frameworks to respond, a new World Bank Group study of the global recession and its aftermath finds.</p>
      <p>With multiple risks to global growth clouding the outlook, there is concern whether emerging and developing economies can effectively respond to a deeper economic slowdown as they were able to do during the 2009 global recession. The new study by the World Bank Group, <i><a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/32641/167273.pdf">A Decade after the Global Recession</a></i><i>,</i> compares emerging market and developing economies’ preparedness then and now, and finds reason both for concern and for optimism.</p>
      <p><i>“The big lesson of the past decade is clear, you need to be prepared for the unexpected,”</i> said World Bank Group Vice President for Equitable Growth, Finance and Institutions, Ceyla Pazarbasioglu. <i>“Developing countries need to urgently boost resilience and growth, by building human and physical capital, streamlining business regulations, and strengthening institutions.”</i></p>
      <p>Since the 2009 global recession, emerging and developing economies have become more vulnerable to external shocks in an environment of mounting debt and weakening long-term growth prospects, the study finds.</p>
      <p>However, at the same time, many emerging market and developing economies now have stronger policy frameworks, such as fiscal rules and inflation targeting monetary policy regimes, than during earlier financial crises and global recessions. Meanwhile, international financial sector regulation has strengthened.</p>
      <p><i>“Policy frameworks in many emerging and developing economies have become more resilient, for example through inflation targeting regimes and fiscal rules,”</i> said World Bank Prospects Group Director Ayhan Kose. <i>“However, in light of downside risks and elevated vulnerabilities, policymakers should prepare their economies to mitigate the impact of adverse shocks and ensure that policy space is available to act when such shocks occur, as they inevitably will.”</i></p>
      <p>The World Bank Group’s response to the global recession was unprecedent in both financing volume and country coverage, and prioritized the areas of finance, infrastructure, fiscal management, and social protection. The Bank introduced new crisis response facilities to improve its assistance to developing economies and improved its monitoring of global macroeconomic developments to more effectively flag risks.</p>
