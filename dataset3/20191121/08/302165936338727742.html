      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Petra Energy Bhd returned to profitability with a net profit of RM25.04 million in the third quarter (Q3) ended Sept 30, 2019 against a net loss of RM26.97 million in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>Revenue was higher at RM219 million against RM119.74 million previously.</p>
      <p>For the nine-month period, it registered a net profit of RM40.87 million versus a net loss of RM41.88 million, while revenue was higher at RM468.52 million from RM275.59 million previously.</p>
      <p>In a filing with Bursa Malaysia today, Petra Energy said its services segment posted a pre-tax profit of RM32.1 million in Q3 2019 against a pre-tax loss of RM19.7 million in Q2 2018 on higher revenue.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, its marine assets segment recorded a pre-tax profit of RM3.2 million due to higher vessel utilisation against a pre-tax loss of RM17.7 million.</p>
      <p>The production and development segment posted a pre-tax profit of RM29 million from a pre-tax loss of RM4.1 million in Q3 2018 as a dispute pertaining to disapproved petroleum cost that affected the share of results of an associate has been resolved.</p>
      <p>Hence, this has allowed the group to recognise in full the share of results of the associate accumulated from Q2 2018.</p>
      <p>“There are signs that the industry is recovering from a period of low activities.</p>
      <p>“The group is cautiously optimistic and will explore new opportunities within the energy sector while continuing its cost management and improving its execution efficiency,” Petra Energy added. — Bernama</p>
