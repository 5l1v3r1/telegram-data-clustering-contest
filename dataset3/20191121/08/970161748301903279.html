      <p>It’s been a bad week for Aaron Carter, as the singer lost his second court case and was hit with a restraining order from his brother, Nick.</p>
      <p>The singer, 31, has been banned from contacting Nick Carter or his family for a year after Nick said he feared for their safety in light of Aaron’s ‘increasingly alarming behaviour’.</p>
      <p>Aaron didn’t show up to the hearing in Las Vegas on Wednesday, TMZ reports, so the judge had an ‘easy decision’ to grant Nick – who was in attendance – the order, which will stay in place until November 2020.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t bothered by the decision, however, tweeting: ‘My legal team and I was thrilled I don’t have to talk to them for a year.’</p>
      <p>It’s the second restraining order in as many days for Aaron, who is also <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/aaron-carter-says-lost-everything-judge-rules-remove-gun-collection-court-11185679/">banned from contacting his twin sister Angel, and has been ordered to get rid of his collection of guns.</a></p>

      <p>The singer was apparently left furious after being told to give up the collection –<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/aaron-carter-added-new-assault-rifles-pawn-shop-gun-collection-just-two-months-ago-11187474/"> which includes several machine guns</a> – and told the judge he would just head to another state to buy more.</p>
      <p>TMZ reports that he threatened to leave the courtroom after being told he was ‘too dangerous to possess guns’, but was ordered to sit down by the judge.</p>

      <p>He said at the time that he was taking legal action ‘in light of Aaron’s increasingly alarming behavior and his recent confession that he harbors thoughts and intentions of killing my pregnant wife and unborn child’.</p>
      <p>He and Angel applied for a restraining order, telling their followers Aaron ‘confessed to [Angel] that he had violent thoughts towards babies and our family members’.</p>
      <p>Aaron denied the claims, saying he doesn’t want to harm anyone, least of all his own family, but wants nothing more to do with them after the way they have treated him.</p>
      <p>As well as his legal battles, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/aaron-carter-reveals-dramatic-weight-loss-seen-first-time-since-leaving-hospital-11178958/">Aaron was also hospitalised last week after visiting his mother</a>, who was concerned over his dramatic weight loss, which hasn’t been helped by all the recent stress.</p>
