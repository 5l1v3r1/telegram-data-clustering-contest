      <p>Top Congress leaders and core members of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) continued to brainstorm on Thursday morning at party chief Sonia Gandhi’s residence over the <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ncp-shiv-sena-and-congress-work-out-draft-common-minimum-programme/article29975549.ece">Common Minimum Programme </a>(CMP) to support a Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, <i>The Hindu</i> reported how the use of the word “secularism” was proving tricky for the parties to come to an agreement.</p>

      <p>Sources claimed that the Congress was insisting on the inclusion of ‘secularism’ in the Common Minimum Programme (CMP), while the Shiv Sena does not want it so.</p>
      <p>NCP chief Sharad Pawar is learnt to have suggested that the CMP could simply refer to abide by the Preamble of the Constitution without explicitly mentioning it.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday’s (Wednesday) meeting was on Common Minimum Programme and leaders of the two parties (NCP and Congress) have said the deliberations were positive. In a day or two, the three parties will reach a consensus. Maharashtra will get a stable government led by Shiv Sena before December,” Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut told reporters.</p>
      <p>The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) too met separately and and a joint meeting between Congress-NCP is scheduled for the afternoon.</p>
      <p>There will be another meeting in Mumbai on Friday, and if all goes well between the potential allies, a formal announcement could be made.</p>
      <p>“There are four or five issues that need to be clarified,” said Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat after the morning meeting of the Congress.</p>
      <p>The formulation on secularism is going to be a crucial one for the Congress as one of its allies in Kerala, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), met Ms. Gandhi over the possible tie-up with the Sena.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, for the first time, the Congress-NCP alliance said that they in-principle agreed to be part of a Sena-led alliance.</p>
