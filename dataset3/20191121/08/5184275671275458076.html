      <p>Ajay Devgn and Rohit Shetty share a great bond. Not just films but two have been good friends since Rohit’s entry in the industry. Rohit who was present at the trailer launch of Ajay Devgn’s next film <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i>, had many emotional things to say about his former boss and Ajay also expressed how important Rohit is to him.</p>
      <p>Ajay talking about Rohit, who has been with him for the past 30 years, said that he is one of the most important people in his life. He said, “My journey would have remained incomplete without Rohit. He had joined Ajay Devgn films as an assistant and became part of the family. I take loads of pride in Rohit, who started with us and has reached so far. He made it possible with his dedication and hard work as well as his passion. All of us have witnessed his journey.”</p>

      <p>An emotional yet happy Rohit said, “My film journey would be incomplete without Ajay Devgn’s part in it. We have spent 30 years together, and this relation is just not about a few Fridays, but of two generations. Let me tell you that whatever you guys see in Tanhaji is a dream that Ajay had nurtured for almost 30 years. He wanted it to be a visual of a lifetime for all of you.</p>
      <p>Incidentally and fortunately, this is Ajay’s 100th film, but behind this has been his honesty, commitment and dedication,” he said with a smile.</p>
      <p>Tanhaji is based on the fierce Maratha warrior who fought a big battle that bought the Maratha empire one of the biggest victories.</p>
      <p>Talking about the film and the trailer, Rohit said, “Ajay sir’s company and the VFX team have worked hard on it. Om Raut (Director), Ajay sir, Saif Ali Khan, and all others have worked so hard that whatever you will witness today, I guarantee that you guys will witness it for the first time in the Indian cinema. The credit obviously goes to actor/producer Ajay, who wanted to form his own company and has been successful especially by giving something unique to the audiences,” he shared.</p>
      <p>Tanhaji is directed by Om Raut and is set to hit the screens on January 10.</p>
