        <b>Luis Enrique’s return to football is the “best news” of the sudden Spain coaching switch, says Barcelona defender Gerard Pique.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Gerard Pique has welcomed Spain’s reappointment of Luis Enrique but admitted to being surprised at Roberto Moreno’s abrupt departure.</p>
      <p>The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) confirmed the unexpected coaching change on Tuesday, bringing an end to Moreno’s brief stint in charge of the 2010 World Cup winners.</p>
      <p>Moreno took over in a caretaker capacity in March and assumed the head coach role on a full-time basis in June.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique had stepped down as his young daughter, Xana, had developed bone cancer. She died in August.</p>
      <p>His former assistant, Moreno, won seven and drew two of the nine matches he oversaw in total, leading to a sense of shock when it became evident that Monday’s Euro 2020 qualifier against Romania was to be his last game.</p>
      <p>“In truth it is a little surprising, we all got a little surprise,” Barca defender Pique told Mundo Deportivo.</p>
      <p>“I’m not there, I haven’t talked to my [Barcelona] team-mates because they played on Monday and they didn’t train [Tuesday].”</p>
      <p>“I am very happy that Luis Enrique returns to training, that is the best news of all,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“Regarding the relationship between Luis Enrique and Robert Moreno, I have no idea what happened.”</p>

      <p>Pique has been out of the Spain side since retiring from international football following the 2018 World Cup in Russia.</p>
      <p>He remains a regular starter at club level and expects to stay at Camp Nou until the end of his distinguished career, which could yet end before his contract expires in 2022.</p>
      <p>“I have always said my last team will be Barca,” said the 32-year-old.</p>
      <p>“I have absolutely no intention of wearing any other shirt because… I have been a ‘Cule’ all my life. For me, being at Barca is the biggest dream of all.</p>
      <p>“My intention is to get to 2022, but I don’t have a crystal ball and I don’t know if I’m going to be able to do it.</p>
      <p>“If I see that I lose importance or see that I am not at the [required] level, I have no problem leaving earlier.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it will happen because I know myself and I am able to endure until 2022, but you never know.”</p>
