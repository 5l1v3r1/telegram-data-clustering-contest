      <h1>What Portishead Town Council would spend the money on if tax rise is approved</h1>
      <h2>People in Portishead are being asked whether they want a hike in council tax bills to fund better services for the town</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:37:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:37</time> by <a rel="author">Heather Pickstock</a></address>
      <p>Portishead could get its own traffic warden, new CCTV system and community fridge project – if plans to increase spending in the growing town get the green light,</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/portishead">Portishead</a> Town Council is currently consulting on moves to increase its annual precept, the money it collects on council tax bills for the services it runs.</p>
      <p>Currently the town council precept is one of the lowest in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">North Somerset</a> at just 50 pence per week per band D household and is dramatically lower than other neighbouring towns and villages.</p>

      <p>The precept in neighbouring <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clevedon">Clevedon</a> is 90 pence a week and in Yatton homeowners pay £1.43 for services provided by the parish council.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nailsea">Nailsea</a> the town council precept is £1.48 a week and in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/weston-super-mare">Weston-super-Mare</a> it is £1.47.</p>
      <p>The town council is proposing to increase the precept to ensure it is put on a firm financial footing and can plan for the future.</p>
      <p>The council is putting forward three options – from increasing the precept from between 70 and 80 pence per week per household to a rise of up to £1.60 a week.</p>
      <p>The first option – a rise to between 70 and 80 pence a week – would be ‘enough to keep the lights on’ and keep the council and its services running and slowly build up the council’s cash reserves.</p>
      <p>But more ambitious plans are included in the second option to increase the precept to between £1.05 and £1.20 per household per week.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Money collected under this option could be spent on a number of new projects for the growing town including employing a traffic enforcement officer and renewing Portishead’s CCTV system.</p>
      <p>Other plans include more bins, a yearly event to celebrate the work of volunteers in the town and funding for a new, major community project every year.</p>
      <p>There would also be ‘seed’ funding to help with the development of a new skate and wheels park and a ‘peoples’ budget’ with cash up to £500 which community groups could bid for each year.</p>
      <p>Under this option the council would also use cash to build up its cash reserves and run its current services.</p>
      <p>The third option – a precept of between £1.30 and £1.60 a week would see reserves built up at a faster rate and used in the future to consider investment options for the town.</p>
      <p>Under this option the money could be used for a ‘major strategic community project’ such as a new community orchard or to refurbish current community buildings.</p>

      <p>Money raised would also be used to promote Portishead as a key destination to visitors.</p>
      <p>Cash could also be put aside to develop a community resilience project.</p>
      <p>Money would also be earmarked for a fighting fund to fight off unwanted development. Cash could also be put in a ‘land fund’ to allow the council to purchase sites to be used as green spaces and play areas in a bid to protect the environment.</p>
      <p>Work on the development of a Neighbourhood Plan would also be sped up.</p>
      <p>A community fridge could also be developed to help tackle food poverty in the town. There are also plans for a ‘library of things’ which would be stocked with useful items local residents could borrow.</p>
      <p>Initiatives which promote positive mental health, physical fitness and prevent social isolation could be launched.</p>
      <p>Full details of all the options are to be discussed at a public meeting tonight (Wednesday) at 7.30pm at the Folk Hall.</p>

      <p>A Portishead Town Council spokesman said: “This is only the first part of our consultation work on this year’s budget.</p>
      <p>“We are sure the people of Portishead will have many other ideas and some better ones.</p>
      <p>“It is important people take part as these views will help shape the future of the town.”</p>
      <p>We will also have our public meeting on Wednesday 20th November 7.30pm at the Folk Hall. A leaflet insert with the options will also be going in the North Somerset Times. Other events may be scheduled depending on demand.</p>
