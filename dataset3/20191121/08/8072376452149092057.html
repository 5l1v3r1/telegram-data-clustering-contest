      <p>PayPal has agreed to buy Honey Science, a technology platform for shopping and rewards, for $4 billion (£3 billion), in what CEO Dan Schulman described as “amongst the most transformative acquisitions in PayPal’s history.”</p>
      <p>The acquisition will massively broaden the reach of Honey, which has approximately 17 million monthly active users; it will now gain access to PayPal’s 300 million user and 24 million merchant accounts.</p>

      <p>Honey Science, which has partnered with 30,000 merchants, notifies consumers when prices drop, via a <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180082320A1/en">patented plugin</a>. (“A computer system is configured to directly interface with a website via a webpage to change certain numerical values through the use of digital codes. The digital codes are applied to a data entry interface on the webpage, and the responses are monitored and transmitted back to a server system…”) It has a team of 350.</p>

      <p>PayPal’s Schulman said: “The combination of Honey’s complementary consumer products with our platform will significantly enhance our ability to drive engagement… As a partner of choice for our merchants, this is another way that we can help them build and strengthen their customer relationships, provide personalized offers, and drive incremental sales.”</p>
      <p>LA-based Honey was originally founded as a web browser extension and has grown into a suite of free tools. It claims to have helped consumers save $1 billion in the past year alone. Honey was profitable on a net income basis in 2018, and the acquisition is expected to add to PayPal’s non-GAAP EPS in 2021.</p>
      <p>e-commerce and consumer internet companies raised over US$7 billion in PE/VC capital in 2018, EY estimated early this year.</p>
