      <p>If you're a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> user you will no doubt have seen cartoons depicting families in a festive setting appearing on your feed recently.</p>
      <p>The latest fad on the social media site has a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> twist - and it's likely to become even more popular as Christmas Day approaches.</p>
      <p>Families have been using a website to turn themselves and their loved ones into a cartoon, complete with a seasonal backdrop.</p>
      <p>If you've seen one of these cartoons and wondered how your friends did it, in the hope of giving it a go for yourself, you're not alone.</p>

      <p>The images are actually created on a website on which people can personalise their own Christmas mugs, reports <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/how-make-facebook-cartoon-family-17286080">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mademine.com/products/christmas-best-friends-coffee-mugs">MadeMine site</a> lets people select the number of people and pets in their family, add their names and even choose their hair colour and style to make it truer to life.</p>
      <p>Once designed, people are then sharing their creation on Facebook.</p>
      <p>There are various backdrops to choose from, but the family at the fireside seems to be proving most popular.</p>
      <p>You can order the mugs too if you like and with the Black Friday sale they're reduced from £30.85 to £18.50.</p>
      <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.mademine.com/products/christmas-best-friends-coffee-mugs">website</a> for more details.</p>
