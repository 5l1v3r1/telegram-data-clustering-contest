      <h1>Watch Saladin Ahmed Talk About His Love For Marvel and His Work on Miles Morales: Spider-Man and The Magnificent Ms. Marvel</h1>

      <p><a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/boom-studios-newest-comic-abbott-is-a-70s-set-supernatu-1819509791">Saladin Ahmed</a> is one of Marvel’s most interesting writers right now. Working on two of their youngest, most vibrant characters, <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/miles-morales-is-getting-back-to-his-spider-man-roots-i-1829056945">Miles Morales</a> and <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/kamala-khans-creator-is-stepping-away-from-ms-marvel-1831104153">Kamala Khan</a>, Ahmed is doing work that could easily shape the future of one of the Marvel Universe’s most interesting corners.</p>
      <p>Thanks to Marvel’s Twitter account, we now have a fun little chance to get to know Ahmed better. In an interview posted this weekend, Ahmed answers fan questions, ranging from his favourite <i>X-Men </i>characters and his personal Marvel fandom to deeper questions about how he’s writing his young heroes and what he intends to do with them.</p>

      <p>Most interestingly, he talks about his hope to give Miles Morales a more traditional rogues' gallery. Typically, Miles’ status as a legacy character has muddled attempts to give him his own, distinct set of foes, with a couple of compelling exceptions. Ahmed hopes that, by giving Miles those enemies, he can bolster his story as a traditional Spider-Man.</p>
      <p>The whole interview isn’t very long, but it gives the viewer a strong sense of Ahmed and his personality as a Marvel creator. If you’re interested in his work or in these characters, check it out.</p>
