      <p>Liverpool duo of Mohamed Salah and Andrew Robertson are reportedly doubtful for their Premier League clash against Crystal Palace this weekend.</p>
      <p>The two players are said to have failed fitness tests having suffered ankle injuries before the international break.</p>
      <p>They were also excluded from their respective national team games in a bid to rest well ahead of their trip to Selhurst Park but it doesn't look like they would be available for selection in the game.</p>

      <p>Another major doubt for the clash is Joel Matip who also suffered an ankle injury in the Reds 1-1 draw against Manchester United about a month ago.</p>

      <p>Sky Sports, however, reports that Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp will have Jordan Henderson to fall back on after recovering from some unnamed illness.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez, who had an altercation with Raheem Sterling in their last Premier League clash at Anfield, still struggles with fitness but the club hopes he will be available for the meeting.</p>
      <p>One of the good news for the Reds going into the game is the return of Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri after missing-in-action for the last two months owing to the calf injury he suffered back then.</p>

      <p>They have won all their matches except for their 1-1 draw against Man United in one of the toughest games so far this campaign.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1270659-liverpool-tottenham-mohamed-salahs-penalty-jurgen-klopps-men-2-1-win.html">Mohamed Salah's penalty was all Liverpool needed to overpower Tottenham Hotspur</a> at Anfield.</p>
      <p>Harry Kane gave the visitors the lead in the early minutes of the game but a Jordan Henderson's 52nd-minute strike restored parity for the hosts.</p>
      <p>Egyptian forward then sealed the victory for the Reds before the game wrapped up.</p>
