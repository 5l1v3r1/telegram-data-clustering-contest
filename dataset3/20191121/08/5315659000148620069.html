      <p>New Zealand First is proud to announce the Provincial Growth Fund (PGF) has allocated $3.5 million to develop innovative predator control approaches which will reduce the need for repeated 1080 use.</p>
      <p>$19.5 million of PGF funding was announced for Predator Free 2050 Limited in February 2019.</p>
      <p>$3.5 million of this funding will be used to develop five smart technology prototypes.</p>
      <p>New Zealand First Health Spokesperson Jenny Marcroft said “this initiative will stimulate the development of more effective traps, lures, remote sensing, and surveillance and data management technologies.</p>
      <p>“The funding signals a necessary and significant shift away from the use of 1080 in New Zealand without compromising our pest control requirements.<br/>“New Zealand First supports the reduction of 1080 and champions the development of viable alternatives.</p>
      <p>“Today’s announcement for the funding of five innovative pest control solutions is testament to Kiwi ingenuity which will have a positive impact on reducing predators,” said Ms Marcroft.</p>
