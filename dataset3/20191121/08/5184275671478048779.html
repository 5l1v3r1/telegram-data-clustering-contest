      <p>Yesterday, Kartik along with his leading ladies Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday, were in Delhi to launch their new song <i>Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare</i>. The actors were seen in the multiplex to drop the song for the fans. However, what surprised everyone in the city was the heartthrob doing some mad antics to impress his fans. Kartik climbed on the multiplex terrace which was surely unexpected and started grooving to the song.</p>
      <p>The crowd went berserk seeing their favourite hero do such candid stuff and were seen cheering for him. The hundreds of fans who were gathered to catch a glimpse of Kartik were thoroughly surprised to see him dance and make everyone feel special. He later even stepped down, interacted with his fans and even posed for pictures with him. The crowd kept hooting and screaming and wanted more of him, but he surely made their time worth a while.</p>
      <p>The song <i>Ankhiyon Se Goli Maare</i> is being loved by all. The song sees Kartik’s sizzling and unique chemistry with Bhumi and Ananya, and their dance moves are already being aped by dance lovers. This film has been the talk of the town ever since its inception and now we can’t wait for it to hit the big screen on 6 December.</p>
