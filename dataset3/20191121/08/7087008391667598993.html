      <h1>Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Facing Decision Point Today, Goodbye Party For $8000 Starting Now?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:46:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Yuval Gov</a></address>
      <p>Since the massive price drop at the beginning of this week, and for the past three days, Bitcoin is trading a little above the $8000 support area.</p>
      <p>This $8000 support line is getting its strength from the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-crypto-advanced-technical-analysis/">78.6% Fibonacci level</a>, along with the mid-term ascending trend-line and the historic price support area of $8000.</p>
      <p>From the bullish perspective, the fact that the $8K support had held for the last three days might become a ground for a positive correction; however, the bulls anticipating that correction long enough to say that if it didn’t take place until now – it might not come at all, as BTC loses momentum.</p>
      <p>Looking on the following charts, Bitcoin will soon have to make a critical decision facing the mid-term ascending trend-line, along with a short-term descending trend-line.</p>
      <p>Total Market Cap: $221 billion</p>
      <p>Bitcoin Market Cap: $146 billion</p>
      <p>BTC Dominance Index: 66.2%</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Key Levels to Watch</h3>
      <p><b>– Support/Resistance:</b> Same as the last three days, the first level of support is $8000. In case Bitcoin breaks down, then the next support lies around $7700 – $7800. If the last doesn’t hold, then $7400 is the next target, which is Bitcoin’s lowest prices since the parabolic move of June 2019.</p>
      <p>From above, if a correction takes place, Bitcoin will face $8200 as the first possible target (descending trend-line), whereas the next resistance area is the $8300 – $8400 zone.</p>
      <p>Further above is the $8500 area – which is the wedge’s descending trend-line, along with the 50-days moving average line (marked pink on the following daily chart).</p>
      <p><b>– The RSI Indicator:</b> There is no good news here for the bulls – the RSI looks very bearish, heading to the 30 level as of writing theses lines.</p>
      <p>Stochastic RSI oscillator is pointing on oversold on the 1-day chart (for the past ten days already). This can lead to a possible positive correction in the case of a cross-over.</p>
      <p><b>– Trading volume:</b> The market makers are not here yet – the trading volume following the recent days’ action is minimal, very low compared to the monthly average.</p>
