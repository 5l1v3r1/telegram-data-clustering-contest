      <h1>World's first printed Christmas card exhibits at Dickens museum</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:02:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Vin Shahrestani</a></address>
      <p>The world's first printed Christmas card has gone on show at the Charles Dickens Museum in London, just over a month before the Royal Mail deadline for posting Christmas cards in Britain.</p>
      <p>The card was printed in 1843, the year the Victorian author published <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, the story of Ebenezer Scrooge whose miserable attitude is transformed after being visited by the spirits of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come.</p>
      <p>Designed by Henry Cole and illustrated by John Callcott Horsley, the hand-colored card shows a family gathered around a table enjoying a glass of wine with a message: A Merry Christmas and A Happy New Year to You. It was sent from a son to his parents. Of the 1,000 originally printed, 21 survived and one has been loaned to the museum by a book dealer in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>Cole’s original proof is also on loan. It was given as a gift in 1865 and has a penciled note to the recipient in the bottom right-hand corner.</p>
      <p>Dickens and Cole worked at the same time, unknown to each other, shaping what would become popular traditions.</p>

      <p>"This was a really important year for the development of the modern Christmas. The Christmas card is such a big part of our Christmases today. And <i>A Christmas Carol</i> is such a significant story that we see every year at Christmas time," museum curator Louisa Price said.</p>
      <p>Cole was instrumental in setting up the Penny Post in 1840 and imagining the first Christmas card which sold for a shilling (12 pence). Today billions of Christmas cards make their way around the world.</p>
      <p>Dickens realized industrialization meant there was a market for books as Christmas presents. Simon Eliot, co-curator at the museum and specialist in 19th century books, said: "He was able to focus attention on Christmas and give it a sort of identity and verve which it had lacked."</p>
      <p>The exhibition - Beautiful Books: Dickens and the Business of Christmas - runs at the novelist’s former London home, now a museum, until April 19. </p>
