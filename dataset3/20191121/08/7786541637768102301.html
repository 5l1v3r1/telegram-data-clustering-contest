      <p><b>BEIJINGÂ (AP)</b> - A Chinese Commerce Ministry official says Beijing is working to resolve conflicts with Washington over trade, dismissing speculation the talks might be in trouble as unreliable "rumors."</p>
      <p>Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday he could not disclose any new information. But he said China was committed to working toward an agreement.</p>
      <p>Gao said reaching an agreement suits the everyone's interests.</p>
      <p>Financial markets have swung between elation and gloom in recent days depending on conflicting reports citing top officials on both sides.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump had said he hoped to sign a preliminary agreement with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, by this month. Reports this week suggesting a deal might not be struck by the year's end raises the possibility of another painful round of retaliatory tariffs in December.</p>
