      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Abhay-Deol">Abhay Deol</a> whipped up a hilarious storm on social media with his latest post. The actor was snapped dozing on the sets with director Mahesh Majrekar and gave the picture a quirky caption which read, “I finally did it. I slept with my director. On set with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mahesh-Manjrekar">Mahesh Manjrekar</a>.” Dressed in the garbs of a police officer, Abhay was snapped sleeping on a wooden chair while actor turned filmmaker Mahesh Majrekar took a nap while it seemed like he was listening to music.</p>
