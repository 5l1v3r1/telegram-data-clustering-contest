      <p>LIMERICK BAND THE Cranberries have been nominated for Best Rock Album at the 2020 Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>Their final album, In the End, was released earlier this year in memory of frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the nomination the band said Dolores would be “immensely proud”. </p>
      <p>“We are humbly honoured with the news that our final album In the End has been nominated for a 2020 Grammy in the category of Best Rock Album. It’s a fitting tribute to Dolores and her truly amazing talents. She would be immensely proud,” the band tweeted. </p>
      <p>The Cranberries’ In the End is nominated alongside Bring Me The Horizon’s Amo, Cage The Elephant’s Social Cues, I Prevail’s Trauma, and Rival Sons’ Feral Roots. </p>
      <p>The gong for Best Rock Album will be handed out at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards on 26 January 2020 in Los Angeles. </p>

      <p>O’Riordan became the lead singer in The Cranberries before the Limerick band would go on to gain huge success in the early to mid-90s. In the US the band had four Top 20 albums, with single Linger landing at number 8 on the Billboard chart.</p>
      <p>In the End was put on hold after Dolores was found dead in her hotel room in London on 15 January 2018. A few months after, work was restarted on the album using demos previously recorded by Dolores. </p>
      <p>The band had originally planned to release it in March 2018 to mark the 25th anniversary of their debut album Everybody Else is doing it so why can’t we. The 1993 album was an international success with the song Linger becoming the band’s first major hit.</p>
      <p>Noel Hogan, guitarist for The Cranberries, said working on the album after Dolores’ death was a “form of therapy”. </p>
      <p>“It also gave us a focus away from everything that had gone on. You were very much focused on getting the album as good as you could,” Hogan told <a href="https://www.rte.ie/radio1/morning-ireland/">Morning Ireland</a>, adding that without working on the album “I don’t know how we would have done it”. </p>
      <blockquote>Time passes on and a day wouldn’t go by when you wouldn’t forget her you know, I mean, you’d always remember her and but I mean, you do you kind of get on with things and as I said this album, the way was received as well it has definitely helped the whole process.</blockquote>
      <p>The last new album the Cranberries released was Roses in 2012, following a gap of more than a decade.</p>
