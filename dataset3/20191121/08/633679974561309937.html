      <p>The controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso and his two co-accused made a brief appearance in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The 60-year-old Televangelist who is usually dressed in flamboyant outfits arrived at court on Thursday with a Springbok Jersey and a matching scarf.Â </p>
      <p>During their last appearance in October, the Supreme Court of Appeal rejected an application for leave to appeal an earlier ruling in the High Court related to the jurisdiction of the court to hear the charges against him that were allegedly committed outside its jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>Omotoso and his co-accused Lusanda Sulani and Zukiswa Sitho have now petitioned the Constitutional Court.</p>
      <p>The case was postponed to the 28th of January 2020 pending the outcome of the Constitutional Court.</p>
      <p>The three are facing more than 90 charges that include rape and human trafficking.</p>
      <p>Omotoso has been in custody since his arrest in April of 2017, so he's been languishing at St Albans Prison for nearly two and a half years now, while his co-accused are both out on bail.</p>
      <p>A large group of supporters from an organisation called "Christians of South Africa" arrived with a custom made banner where they make several allegations against the State.</p>
