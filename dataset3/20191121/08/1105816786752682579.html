      <h1>Israel shuts down Al-Rasasi Mosque in Jerusalem</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:16:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8672/anadolu-agency/" target="_blank">Anadolu Agency</a></address>
      <p><b>JERUSALEM: </b>Israeli authorities on Wednesday shut down Al-Rasasi Mosque in Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>The Muslim house of worship – located near Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam – was shut for six months on the grounds that parts of it were being used as an office by Jerusalem’s Jordan-run Religious Endowments Authority.</p>
      <p>The offices of Palestinian state television and the Palestinian National Education Directorate in East Jerusalem were also shut for six months following a raid by Israeli police earlier in the day.</p>

      <p>Just weeks earlier, on November 13, scores of Jewish settlers forced their way into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, according to a Palestinian agency.</p>
      <p>“Around 123 settlers backed by Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa compound since early morning,” said the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, a Jordan-run agency responsible for overseeing the city’s Muslim and Christian holy sites.</p>
      <p>Settlers swarmed into the site via the Al-Maghariba Gate, usually guarded by Israeli police.</p>
      <p>For Muslims, Al-Aqsa represents the world’s third-holiest site. Jews, for their part, refer to the area as the ‘Temple Mount’ claiming it was the site of two Jewish temples in ancient times.</p>
      <p>Israel occupied East Jerusalem, in which Al-Aqsa is located, during the 1967 Middle East War. It formally annexed the entire city in 1980, claiming it as its capital – a move never recognised by the international community.</p>
