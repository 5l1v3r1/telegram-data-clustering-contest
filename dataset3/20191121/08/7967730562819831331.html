      <h1>Human Rights Commission to assess Extinction Rebellion's Brisbane library ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Stone</a></address>
      <p>Queensland's Human Rights Commission has stepped in after Brisbane City Council banned a group of climate activists from using public library meeting rooms, with both sides forced into mediation.</p>
      <p>It's understood the council and a representative of Extinction Rebellion subgroup Grey Power must undertake compulsory conciliation in December, after an activist made a formal complaint to the commission.</p>

      <p>Lord mayor Adrian Schrinner announced the ban, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p530xv.html">passed by the council to stop climate activists from pre-booking public library spaces</a>, in October.</p>
      <p>Cr Schrinner said at the time it was not appropriate for ratepayer-funded public spaces to be used by activist groups planning or encouraging illegal activities.</p>
      <p>Grey Power, an Extinction Rebellion subgroup for seniors, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p531pj.html">flouted the ban by immediately booking a meeting room</a> at the Brisbane Square Library the day after it came into effect, arguing members were not planning illegal activity but exercising their right to protest.</p>

      <p>Extinction Rebellion, which shut<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52zuf.html"> down central Brisbane for hours at a time with multiple stunts</a> over an entire week early in October, is expected to protest the library ban on Friday morning outside City Hall.</p>
      <p>Cr Schrinner on Thursday night said he would not be meeting with the group when it was protesting and would not overturn the ban.</p>
      <p>He said the activists' actions in blocking the city with stunts "infuriated" him and he believed the ban was lawful.</p>
      <p>"They were using council facilities. We had to put a stop to it and I think we have the support of Brisbane residents," he said.</p>
      <p>"No group that incites violence and lawlessness should be using council facilities, whether it be libraries or halls.</p>
      <p>"There is great irony that Extinction Rebellion is using the law to enforce their right to break the law."</p>
      <p>The protest follows confirmation a complaint made by a member of Grey Power about the council's ban was recently accepted by the Human Rights Commission for further investigation.</p>
      <p>"Libraries should be for everyone, not just those the lord mayor agrees with. The LNP took away our freedom to meet in the Joh Bjelke-Petersen era. We mustn't allow them to do it again," complainant Miree LeRoy said.</p>
      <p>"We've been paying our rates for decades and deserve to use council facilities the same as anyone else. Protesting is not illegal.</p>
      <p>"The lord mayor stopping our meetings is blatant discrimination, a decision we expect to be reversed."</p>
      <p>Grey Power member Kay Miller, a retired librarian, said the council should not be able to stop the group meeting to discuss "how to protect our kids and grandkids".</p>
      <p>"Libraries are always popular with older people, especially when it's hot. Global heating is already sending our weather to extremes," she said.</p>
      <p>In October, the commission issued a media release detailing concerns about the council's ban.</p>

      <p>Queensland Human Rights Commissioner Scott McDougall said at the time the ban could amount to unlawful discrimination.</p>
      <p>"Denying access to council services on the basis of someoneâ€™s political belief or involvement in protest activity impedes several fundamental human rights that will be <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p510k0.html">protected under the Human Rights Act from 1 January 2020</a>," Mr McDougall said.</p>
      <p>"However, existing discrimination laws already prohibit discrimination on the ground of political activity and, on the face of it, the ban would appear to be unlawful."</p>
      <p>The commission does not comment on individual complaints due to confidentiality, and conciliation is not open to the public.</p>
      <p>Queensland's Anti-Discrimination Act 1991 prohibits discrimination on the basis of political belief.</p>
      <p>The Australian Library and Information Association wrote to the lord mayor expressing concern about the ban in October.</p>
