      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:21:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:21</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Young</a></address>
      <p>Model <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/slick-woods">Slick Woods</a> has revealed that she is currently undergoing <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. </p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the 23-year-old, who <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/slick-woods-baby-labour-pregnant-model-rihanna-fenty-fashion-show-runway-new-york-a8843296.html">famously went into labour</a> during <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Rihanna">Rihanna’s</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/savage-x-fenty">Savage x Fenty</a> show in 2018, announced the news on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/instagram">Instagram</a>. </p>
      <p>Alongside a photograph of herself posing with her tongue out with boyfriend Mick Munday and friends, Woods wrote: “How I feel about chemotherapy, shout out to everyone that gotta go through it #atleastimalreadybald.”</p>
      <p>The model’s post was inundated with comments from friends and fans wishing her well, including Munday, who wrote: “U got this.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/hidden-figures"><i>Hidden Figures</i></a> actor <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/taraji-p-henson">Taraji P. Henson</a> added: “You are already on the other side of this healthy and strong like it never happened. I adore you.”</p>
      <p>While many of the comments were well meaning, it appeared as though some of the support frustrated Woods.</p>
      <p>She followed up the first post with a second message and a photograph of her one-year-old son, Saphir, making a grouchy expression.</p>
      <p>“Stop treating me like a victim,” Woods wrote.</p>

      <p>A final post shared by Woods featured a photograph of herself attending the Savage x Fenty show in September, writing: “'Modern day Gia without the drugs #justcrazy ‘where does everyone go when they have to go’.”</p>
      <p>The caption appears to reference supermodel <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/gia-the-tragic-tale-of-the-worlds-first-supermodel-311535.html">Gia Carangi</a>, who died of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/AIDS">AIDS</a>-related complications at the age of 26 in 1986.</p>

      <p>While many social media users have assumed that the model is fighting <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Cancer">cancer</a>, Woods did not explicitly reveal the reason she is undergoing treatment.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/chemotherapy/">NHS</a>, chemotherapy can be used to treat many disorders including cancers, blood disorders and autoimmune diseases.</p>
