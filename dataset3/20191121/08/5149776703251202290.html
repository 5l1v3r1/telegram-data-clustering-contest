      <h1>'I don't think' - Martin O'Neill finally speaks about his future after Nottingham Forest sacking</h1>
      <h2>'I obviously have enjoyed a great time in football'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:01:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p>Martin O'Neill has revealed he is keen on a return to management.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old has been out of work since being sacked by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> and replaced by <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a> in June, after just five months in charge at the City Ground.</p>
      <p>But the former Leicester City, Celtic, Aston Villa and Republic of Ireland boss has made it clear he wants to make a return to football.</p>
      <p>"I am between jobs. I obviously have enjoyed a great time in football and I don't think it has ended yet," he said.</p>

      <p>Asked if he would prefer a return to international or club management, O'Neill added: "I have been lucky to have been involved in both but the very obvious difference between the two is the length of time you have with the players.</p>
      <p>"It is very little time you have as an international manager, every time you meet up you are hoping your best players are available for that time and that is not always the case."</p>
