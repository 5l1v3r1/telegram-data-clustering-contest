      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/liverpool">Liverpool</a> are to stage a public consultation into proposals to increase Anfield’s capacity to more than 60,000 by rebuilding the Anfield Road stand.</p>
      <p>The European champions confirmed in August that plans to add an extra 4,000 seats had been abandoned in favour of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/aug/22/liverpool-reveal-plan-to-increase-anfield-capacity-to-beyond-60000-football">a more ambitious scheme</a> and allowed outline planning permission for the original development to expire in September.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/liverpool">Liverpool</a> have now distributed more than 5,000 leaflets to Anfield residents inviting them to the first stage of a public consultation on their latest plans, and are asking residents, businesses and fans for feedback on a new stand that would raise overall capacity from 54,074 to more than 60,000.</p>
      <p>Consultation events will be held at the Kop bar in the Kop stand on 29 November, 2 December and 3 December while there will also be a pop-up information stand in Anfield Road before Liverpool’s home games against Brighton on 30 November and Everton on 4 December. Supporters will also be able to submit views online once the consultation events begin.</p>
