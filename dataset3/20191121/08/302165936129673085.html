      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 — Taiwanese novelist and filmmaker Giddens Ko was left red-faced when a status update on his Facebook page had one of his followers relate it to Ko’s scandal with a Taiwanese news anchor five years ago.</p>
      <p><i>Sin Chew Daily</i> reported that Ko had uploaded the status recently where he criticised those who uploaded pictures of them having a meal.</p>
      <p>“Do not understand what these people are thinking,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>One internet user replied on the post that those who post the pictures are having their meals openly.</p>
      <p>“Unlike some who hide themselves to eat,” wrote the user, linking it to Ko’s controversy with the news anchor.</p>
      <p>The status was later removed by Ko.</p>
      <p>Ko, who uses the pen name Jiubadao,  had in October 2014 admitted to cheating on his long-time girlfriend, Xiao Nei after being photographed entering a motel with Chou Ting Yu.</p>
      <p>The pair got married in 2017.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, many Hong Kong internet users, took the status as Ko supporting the protesters and praised him.</p>
      <p>Ko had been voicing his support for protesters in Hong Kong on his social media.</p>
      <p>In a November 19 update, Ko wrote he respected those who stood at the front lines.</p>
      <p>“I respect keyboard warriors who encourage others. You guys are braver that heroes in novels,” he wrote.</p>
