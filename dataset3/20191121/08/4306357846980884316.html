      <h3>Gary Lineker has taken to social media to reveal his surprise that Tottenham Hotspur opted to sack Mauricio Pochettino this week – before replacing him with Jose Mourinho.</h3>
      <p>The north London side decided to make a change eight days into the international break after Spurs drew 1-1 with Sheffield United at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last time out.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was officially confirmed as Spurs’ new manager on Wednesday morning soon after the Lilywhites announced the departure of Pochettino on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Lilywhites have made a poor start to the Premier League season as key players such as Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli and Hugo Lloris struggle to find form.</p>
      <p>Tottenham are in 14th position in the Premier League table and 11 points behind defending champions Manchester City, who occupy the final Champions League qualification spot.</p>
      <p>Spurs reached their first-ever Champions League final last season before the north London outfit suffered a 2-0 loss to domestic rivals Liverpool FC in the final.</p>
      <p>Pochettino steered Tottenham to a top-four finish in their last four seasons under the former Southampton boss.</p>
      <p>Tweeting before Mourinho’s appointment on Wednesday morning, former Spurs striker Lineker had his say on the north London club’s decision to sack Pochettino.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1196878363568279552?s=20">Lineker wrote on Twitte</a>r: “Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by<br/>@SpursOfficial. He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement….ain’t gonna happen.”</p>
      <p>Tottenham have never won the Premier League title despite challenging for the top-flight crown twice under Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs will return to Premier League action with a trip to bitter London rivals West Ham United at the London Stadium on Saturday.</p>
