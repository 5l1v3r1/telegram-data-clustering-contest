      <p>Qatar-Thailand diplomatic relations which will have its 40th anniversary next year, may soon find new areas of cooperation, particularly in the food security sector, Thailand’s Ambassador to Qatar, Nathapol Khantahiran has said.</p>
      <p>Qatar is currently Thailand’s third largest trading partner in the Middle East. Thailand is best known for its food security programme. “We are seeking more opportunities in this sector, as well as to provide more halal food to Qatar,” Khantahiran told mediapersons on the sidelines of the celebration of Thailand’s Loy Krathong Festival at the Dusit Doha Hotel on Monday.</p>
      <p>Total trade volume between the two countries witnessed a 30 percent growth to QR12.8bn in 2018 from QR10bn in 2017, according to data released by the Qatar Chamber.  </p>
      <p>“Total trade between both countries stood at around $4bn last year, while Thailand’s exports to Qatar was valued at around $400m. Thailand’s LNG imports from Qatar is valued at around $3.6bn to $3.7bn each year. Currently, Qatar meets 24 percent of Thailand’s total LNG imports. We have been discussing about increasing trade and energy security. But we might find some new areas for cooperation”, the envoy said.</p>
      <p>The Thai Ambassador added that two Thai delegations from the food sector have already visited Qatar this year, and have met with their Qatari counterparts to discuss future partnerships.</p>
      <p>He added: “Thailand is famous for its sustainability and food security programme, which is a model for developing countries. It includes projects for farming and agricultural products. We have already implemented some projects to some countries, like Fiji, Bhutan, and other African countries. Qatar is now a donor country in this sector, and we can find ways of cooperation, mostly in agriculture and planting projects”.</p>
      <p>The Thai Ambassador added that big supermarkets in Qatar, such as Lulu Hypermarket, Al Meera, and Mega Mart are the main importers of Thai food products in the country. “And we shall introduce more products. This year, I already received two Thai delegations from the food sector in Qatar. And next year, we’ll have more trade delegations from Thailand,” he added.</p>
      <p>To date, there are 12 Thai hotels and restaurants operating in Qatar. And next year, two more hotels will open, which will include the Dusit Doha Hotel &amp; Suites and another Centara-branded property, Khantahiran said.</p>
      <p>He added: “Around 30,000 tourists from Qatar visited Thailand last year. The Thai community in Qatar has around 2,000-3,000 members, and the number is expected to increase, since we have just recently signed a bilateral agreement with Qatar on labour cooperation. Within the next two to three years, we’ll see more Thai presence in Qatar”.</p>
      <p>The Ambassador added that there has been a significant increase in the number of bilateral visits between both countries in the past 10 years, particularly visits from Thailand’s royal family to Qatar.</p>
      <p>“This year, there has been many more such activities, starting from the visit of Qatar’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs H E Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani to Thailand in August. For next year, Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha is also expected to visit Qatar to attend the Asia Cooperation Dialogue event which will be hosted here,” Khantahiran added.</p>
