      <p>Xiaomi’s Mi Smart Band 3i is a device made to be sold in India alone. It features a set of upgrades over its predecessor, Mi Band HRX. The display size goes up from a 1.2cm (0.42) unit to a 1.9cm (0.78), with AMOLED technology and touch support. Users can expect a 20-day battery life, with capacity having been bumped up from 70mAh to 110mAh.</p>
      <p>Besides tracking steps and calories, Mi Smart Band 3i also enables viewing notifications directly on the band. It comes with “Find Device” option which helps detecting a paired smartphone directly from the band. Mi Smart Band 3i is water resistant upto 5ATM (50 metres in depth for 10 minutes), making it safe to be used while swimming and in showers. </p>
