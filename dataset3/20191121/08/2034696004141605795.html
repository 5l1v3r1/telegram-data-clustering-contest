      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/next-series-better-call-saul-delayed-2474052#RlBG0aFbfvY6Pd1z.99">Back in April, it was announced that Season 5 of the show was being delayed</a>, with AMC President Sarah Barnett revelling that the fifth season of Vince Gilligan’s show won’t return until  2020.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the delay to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/killing-eve-amc-networks-bbc-america-strategy.html">Vulture</a>, Barnett said: “It’s driven by talent needs, which we would not override if it would result in a worse show.”</p>
      <p>Barnett joked: “We know clearly the end was already written before the beginning began” before adding: “The writers, they have a very particular, very clear sense of the arc of their show…We’re certainly getting closer to it.”</p>
      <p>The delay could have be linked to work on <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-review-jesse-pinkman-aaron-paul">El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie</a>, </i>which got a surprise release last month.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>-produced sequel to the original series, which arrived on the streaming platform on October 11, stars Aaron Paul as his <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/breaking-bad"><i>Breaking Bad</i></a> character Jesse Pinkman and picks up the story immediately after the dramatic events of the show’s 2013 finale.</p>
      <p><i>El Camino</i> was expected to be a big hit for Netflix upon its release, and the streaming behemoth reported that a staggering 25,734,392 households watched the <i>Breaking Bad</i> sequel in the first seven days.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/el-camino-breaking-bad-movie-review-jesse-pinkman-aaron-paul">NME’s review of the film said:</a> “There are some tender moments – a sweet goodbye with Skinny Pete, a wise and well-chosen conversation with one of the show’s most heartbreaking female characters. But most emotional moments are indulgent and inconclusive, adding unnecessary layers of fan service to an already complete product.</p>
      <p>“The film ends as the show did – Jesse braves his future alone. It’s just puzzling to watch two more hours and reach, essentially, the exact same conclusion.”</p>
