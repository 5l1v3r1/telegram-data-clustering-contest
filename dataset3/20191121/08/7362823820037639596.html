      <p>Republican strategist and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media">MSNBC </a>commentator Steve Schmidt Wednesday evening warned that Democratic presidential candidates that lean to the extreme left may not be able to beat<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump"> President Trump</a> in 2020.</p>
      <p>“I do think there is a danger when you look at some of the ideology that we’ve seen front and center in this field,” Schmidt said during the network’s coverage before the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/elections/presidential-debate">Democratic presidential debate</a> in Atlanta. “In America, a sociopath will beat a socialist seven days a week and twice on Sunday.”</p>

      <p>He said to win the presidency a nominee would need to "assemble the broadest, widest possible political coalition" with Democrats, Independents and Republicans.</p>
      <p>Schmidt added that impeachment followed by acquittal in the Senate was likely, meaning voters would decide Trump's fate.</p>
      <p>“Nobody should underestimate Donald Trump’s ability to frame an argument, to demagogue an opponent,” he said.</p>
      <p>He said if Trump is re-elected in 2020 he would be a "completely lawless and unchecked president who would know that he would be able to survive basically any level of wrongdoing."</p>
