      <h1>Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has important Black Friday advice for ITV Good Morning Britain fans</h1>
      <h2>He said everyone should do this before they buy any deals in the huge sales event</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:16:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/rebecca-koncienzcy/" target="_blank">Rebecca Koncienzcy</a></address>
      <p>Martin Lewis had some very important advice for Good Morning Britain viewers hoping to bag a bargain in the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/money-saving-expert">Money Saving Expert</a> appeared on the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> show ahead of the event on Friday, November 29.</p>
      <p>He said Amazon will start some deals from tomorrow (Friday, November 21) but they have remained tight-lipped about what will be included.</p>
      <p>While he said there is likely to be some one-off price slashes which will only be available for, in some cases, a matter of hours, but they still may not be the cheapest on the market.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old said: "So here is my mantra;</p>
      <p>"Ask yourself, 'do I need it?', 'is it worth it?' and 'have I checked if I can get it cheaper elsewhere?'</p>
      <p>"If the answer to any of them is 'no', don't buy it."</p>
      <p>Martin wants bargain hunters to make sure they don't fall into the trap of just buying it because they think it is cheap.</p>
      <p>Black Friday is a sales event that started in the USA and always falls on the Friday after Thanks Giving (this year on November 28).</p>
      <p>Because many people would still be off work on the Friday, it is almost like an unofficial holiday in America so shops took advantage and offered huge price drops ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>It is a lot like the Boxing Day sales here in the UK.</p>
      <p>From 2010 Black Friday deals started to make there way to Britain and each year it has become bigger than the last.</p>
