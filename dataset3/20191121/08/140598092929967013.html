      <h1>Coldplay putting global tour of latest album on hold because they want it to be carbon neutral</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:27:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/gareth-davies/" target="_blank">Gareth Davies</a></address>
      <p>Coldplay are "taking time" to consider plans to tour their latest album because of environmental concerns, frontman Chris Martin has said.</p>
      <p>The band are in Jordan to perform two shows, from the album Everyday Life, being streamed live on YouTube.</p>
      <p>Martin, 42, told BBC News: "We're taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial."</p>
      <p>He said of any future tour: "We would be disappointed if it's not carbon neutral.</p>
      <p>"We've done a lot of big tours at this point. How do we turn it around so it's no so much taking as giving?"</p>
      <p>The band's last big tour was for A Head Full Of Dreams, in 2016 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Their new record will be released on Friday, with songs inspired by news reports about an Afghan gardener and a Nigerian hymn composer.</p>
