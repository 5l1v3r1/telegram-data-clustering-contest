      <h1>Martin Keown says Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk is ‘as good as anything we have seen’</h1>
      <h2>The Premier League winner has gone big in his praise of the Dutchman.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:45:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal and Everton defender Martin Keown has won the Premier League three times but says he has never seen a better player than Virgil van Dijk.</p>
      <p>As per the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7706389/Harry-Redknapp-backs-Liverpool-beat-Man-City-title.html">Daily Mail,</a> Keown went big in his praise of the Liverpool centre half, saying he is as good as anyone he’s ever seen in his life.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7706389/Harry-Redknapp-backs-Liverpool-beat-Man-City-title.html">said</a>: “He (van Dijk) just came to Liverpool at the right time, that maturity, he purrs around the pitch, he has the pace.</p>
      <p>‘I think he’s as good as anything we’ve seen ever. Only time will tell with what he wins, winning back-to-back trophies, in the modern game he’s certainly the best.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – What else can be added about van Dijk?</h3>
      <p>We all know by now that van Dijk has transformed Liverpool’s defence and is the best central defender in world football right now.</p>
      <p>He is a key reason Liverpool are leading the chase for the Premier League and perhaps Manchester City fans would like to see how the Reds would cope without him for the same period of time they have missed Aymeric Laporte.</p>
      <p>Keown says he’s not seen a better player ever – which is a huge call – but he does know what it takes to be a Premier League winning central defender.</p>
