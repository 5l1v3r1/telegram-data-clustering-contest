      <h1>Google’s ‘Duplex on the web’ enables the Assistant to buy movie tickets for you</h1>
      <h2>The move is part of a much larger strategy to host the transaction.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:01:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://searchengineland.com/author/greg-sterling" target="_blank">Greg Sterling</a></address>
      <p>Google is making it possible to use the Assistant (via Duplex) to buy movie tickets online. Back in May at Google I/O, the company announced that it was expanding the AI-powered Duplex beyond <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/assistant/book-table-google-assistant-across-country-more-devices/">restaurant reservations</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta7M-KMPY4U">booking rental cars</a> and buying movie tickets.</p>
      <p><b>Duplex on the web. </b>Called “Duplex on the web,” users will be able to use the Google Assistant for new reservations and purchase categories. Movies is the latest example.</p>
      <p>As shown below, Android users in the U.S. or U.K. can ask the Assistant for movie showtimes or search movies in the Google app. The Assistant will then lead searchers through a “buy tickets” process that involves theater selection, movie times and, if available, seat selection. A saved payment card needs to be in Chrome to work in this case.</p>

      <p><b>Expanding to many more categories.</b> It’s not clear that users will prefer this process to manually booking tickets. However, it illustrates how Google is bringing the sophistication of its Duplex technology to the broader mobile internet.</p>
      <p>It’s also not clear how much <a href="https://dialogflow.com/docs/integrations/actions/integration">back end integration</a> needs to be done by publishers to enable this; I suspect not that much. Regardless, I’m sure Google has a roadmap that extends to many other categories where online scheduling, reservations and basic transactions are involved.</p>
      <p>Rand Fishkin has been speaking, including at SMX East, about how Google has evolved from “<a href="https://sparktoro.com/blog/google-in-2020-from-everyones-search-engine-to-everyones-competitor/">everyone’s search engine to everyone’s competitor</a>” and the SEO implications of this. My view is a bit different.</p>
      <p><b>Why we should care. </b>Google has now talked repeatedly about “<a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-brings-end-to-end-food-ordering-to-search-maps-google-assistant-317381">helping users get things done</a> in search and with the Google Assistant. This is about making search more transactional and owning the transaction. Google is doing this in <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-bringing-new-shopping-experience-with-personalization-local-and-better-checkout-to-u-s-next-316976">shopping</a> and across the board in local (e.g., <a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/order-your-favorite-food-with-google/">food ordering</a>).</p>
      <p>Google is trying to remove friction and compress the process between search and a sale. It’s handing that process off much less and less to third parties and site owners. This helps Google 1) improve the consumer experience, 2) keep users within its system, 3) create a closed loop for analytics and 4) generate fees or revenue from commerce, which has implications for smart speakers.</p>
      <p>If these capabilities (i.e., Duplex on the web) take off, publishers and brands will need to be partnered or integrated with Google actions/services or risk losing the transaction to a competitor. It will also mean that Google owns the customer.</p>
