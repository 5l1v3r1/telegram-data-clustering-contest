      <h1>British Airways flights disrupted by ‘technical issue’</h1>
      <h2>Some passengers complain of cancellations and delays of up to 22 hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:18:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author">Tanya Powley</a></address>
      <p>British Airways has blamed a “technical issue” for disruption to its flights around the world, with some passengers complaining of cancellations and delays of up to 22 hours.</p>
      <p>The airline on Thursday morning confirmed that its teams were working to “resolve a technical issue”, and said it was rebooking customers on to alternative flights.</p>
      <p>However, BA would not provide details of how many flights the disruption had affected or the reason for the delays.</p>
      <p>The issue comes at a difficult time for the airline, which has been hit with a number of high-profile glitches in recent years, including a major data breach last year and a severe systems failure in 2017 that resulted in hundreds of flights being cancelled.</p>
      <p>In August, BA came under fire for an IT failure at three London airports that caused dozens of flights to be cancelled or delayed.</p>
      <p>This year BA also faced its most serious industrial dispute with pilots in its history, after its cockpit crew went on strike for two days in September, which led to more than 2,000 flights being cancelled.</p>
      <p>Last month, IAG, which owns the airline, announced a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ba7fab9e-fbad-11e9-98fd-4d6c20050229">7 per cent fall</a> in operating profit in the three months to the end of September on the back of the walkouts.</p>
      <p>Dozens of BA customers took to Twitter to complain about the delays. One customer @MPerryDigital <a href="https://twitter.com/MPerryDigital/status/1197392368648904704?s=20">tweeted</a> BA to say he had been delayed by 22 hours and was left 13 hours from home.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: “I would normally empathise with the @British_Airways IT team for a global failure like today, but I’m a passenger with a 22 hour delay, 13 hours from home. Personally, IT camaraderie doesn’t extend to these lengths.”</p>

      <p>Another customer hit out at the delay at Los Angeles. @nmsmith51 <a href="https://twitter.com/nmsmith51/status/1197320165261594624?s=20">tweeted</a>: “@British_Airways WTH! You don’t have a flight a plan…this is unacceptable! You have hundreds of passengers sitting at @flyLAXairport ..NOT OK!!”</p>
      <p>Passengers also complained about the lack of information from BA over the delay.</p>
      <p>Lauren Smiddy @LLS91, <a href="https://twitter.com/LLS91/status/1197341406618148866?s=20">tweeted</a> in the early hours of morning, saying: “Same with BA2273 @British_Airways Sat on the tarmac for 2 hours with no communications. Please don’t reply with another of your generic responses. What is the issue and how much longer are we going to be stuck on this plane?!”</p>
      <p>The delays appear to have affected customers flying from the US, Asia and Africa into London’s Heathrow and Gatwick airports.</p>
      <p>In an updated statement, BA said it planned to operate a full flight schedule on Thursday. “There may be some knock-on delays to flights and we are advising customers to check ba.com for the latest flight information. ​We are sorry for the disruption to customers who have been affected.”</p>
      <p>Consumer group Which? said BA must do the right thing and reroute passengers as quickly as possible, as well as informing customers facing disruption about their entitlement to compensation.</p>
      <p>“This is the latest in a long line of British Airways technical glitches causing delays and cancellations and yet again it’s thousands of passengers who are paying the price — left tired, frustrated and with a lack of information and assistance from the airline,” said Rory Boland, travel editor at Which?</p>
