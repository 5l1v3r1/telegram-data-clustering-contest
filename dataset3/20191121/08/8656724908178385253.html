      <p><a href="http://www.infinixmobility.com/">Infinix Mobile</a> has announced the launch of the S5, as <a href="https://www.techjaja.com/the-infinix-s5-is-rumored-to-launch-with-an-infinity-o-display/">rumored with an Infinity-O Display</a> in Uganda for under UGX 599,000.

      <h4>An Infinity-O Display!</h4>
      <p>One of the key highlights of S5 is its 6.6-inch HD+ Infinity-O Display, which makes it the biggest Infinity-O Display smartphone under RRP UGX 599,000 in the Uganda market. The Infinity-O Display adopts a slimmer, bezel-less design, which allows S5 to achieve a 90.5% screen-to-body ratio. With a 20:9 screen aspect ratio that follows the current cinema screen trends, S5 will provide users with a brilliant viewing experience. Immerse yourself in video streaming, gaming and image capturing!</p>
      <h4>A 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera!</h4>
      <p>The S5 sports a 32MP In-Display AI selfie camera with 1.6 μm larger pixels (after 4-in-1), F2.0 aperture and 4-in-1 super pixel technology. When users are taking photos, the In-Display AI selfie camera automatically implements a 4-in-1 effect based on the ISO value, at which point the size of a single-pixel reaches 1.6 μm, enabling consumers to capture sharp, vivid selfies, especially in low-light and backlight environments. HDR+ is the new technology on S5. It’s the combination of Face recognition, intelligent scene recognition and AI HDR technology, which enable users to capture impressive and artistic portraits. S5 is no doubt a backlit portrait master. What’s more, S5’s selfie camera supports an upgraded 3D Face Beauty function and provides 4 exclusive options to let consumers customize their beauty style.</p>
      <h4>4 AI rear cameras for artistic backlit portraits! </h4>

      <p>The S5 is also equipped with 4 AI rear cameras and quad-smart flash. The rear camera consists of a 16MP AF high-resolution camera, an ultra-wide-angle lens &amp; macro lens camera, a depth field camera, and an AI lens camera. With the macro lens, users will get closer to the subjects they want to capture and see every vivid detail. In addition, with the ultra-wide-angle lens and macro lens, users can create wide-angle and macro videos in video capturing mode, which is a great improvement in comparison with the last generation.</p>
      <h4>Crystal feather pattern design!</h4>
      <p>Inspired by nature and Quetzal bird, S5 adopts a crystal feather pattern design. To bring inspiration to life and ensure that the gradient colors and patterns are perfectly presented on the devices, Infinix teams have invested tremendous efforts and conquered a lot of difficulties. The design of S5 is a manifesto of how Infinix strikes to combine stylish design with the latest technologies and the device is available in three colors – Quetzal Cyan, Nebula Black and Violet.</p>
      <p>S5 is equipped with a 4000mAh big battery with Xcharge function. It adopts a MediaTek Helio P22 processor and runs on the Android<sup>TM</sup> 9 Pie system.
