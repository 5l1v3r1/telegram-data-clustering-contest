      <h4>Leading provider of guest engagement, entertainment and connectivity solutions selected to maximize the digital guest journey at luxury Dubai property.<br/>Â </h4>
      <p>DUBAI, UAE - <b>InnSpire</b>, a leading provider of a comprehensive technology suite that helps drive a seamless, world-class guest experience for some of the world's most iconic hotels and brands, has been selected by <b>ME </b>by <b>Melia</b> to implement its full stack of connectivity and guest engagement solutions at the much anticipated ME Dubai when the property opens in 2020.</p>
      <p>InnSpire's award-winning digital solutions work collaboratively to allow for guest control over their entire travel experience, from guestroom access to temperature and lighting. As such, InnSpire's offerings at the ME Dubai will include the company's full-featured Guest Journey App, its InnCable in-room TV solution and the property's robust Wi-Fi network, all working in concert to provide travelers and hotel operators with seamless and highly personalized command over the guest experience.</p>
      <p>In order to offer the smart TV experience without limiting the property's choice of television hardware, the ME Dubai is adopting InnSpire's proprietary InnCable platform. Because the cable itself is a self-contained IPTV "<i>set-top-box</i>", InnCable allows hotels to flexibly allow Smart TV capabilities anywhere on property, using virtually any screen available.</p>
      <p>"<i>Our integration plan for the ME Dubai is focused on providing an all-in-one solution for one of the most luxurious hotels in one of the most prestigious brands in the world</i>," said <b>Martin Chevalley</b>, InnSpire's CEO. "<i>Hotel operators today are looking for true solution partners, not just individual products working in silos. We are happy to be able to fulfill that need and look forward to the opportunity to work closely with ME by Melia in bringing a uniquely personal luxury experience to Dubai</i>."</p>
      <p>ME by Melia is a lifestyle hotel brand that draws inspiration from international cuisine, music, fashion and design. The brand's Dubai hotel has been designed by legendary architect <b>Zaha Hadid</b>, and the operations is led by GM Stefan Viard.</p>
      <p><i>"When looking for one solution that truly does it all, InnSpire is our obvious choice</i>" said <b>Stefan Viard</b>. "<i>The integrations in the project puts a very high demand on seamlessness and smooth operation. We are looking forward to a guest journey, tied together by the InnSpire App, the TVs and the multiple interfaces that allows guests to communicate with us, and experience the hotel on their own terms</i>".</p>
      <p>The property is expected to open in 2020 in Dubai's Opus Building, and will offer 93 guestrooms, the luxurious Suite ME and 98 private apartments in one of the fastest-growing and iconic travel destinations in the world. ME Dubai also offers 15 restaurants for travelers immerse themselves in, including contemporary Japanese cuisine at Roka by Chef Rainer Becker.</p>
