      <h1>These are the popular apps on Huawei’s AppGallery in South Africa</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>Huawei, at its Developer Day in Cape Town on Thursday, revealed more about its budding ecosystem, growth in South Africa, and its AppGallery.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://huaweimobileservices.com/appgallery/">AppGallery</a> is effectively Huawei’s version of the Google Play Store, serving as an app respository for users. It’s pretty damn important too.</p>
      <p>As we’ve seen by <a href="https://memeburn.com/gearburn/2019/10/huawei-mate-30-google-lz-app/">the Huawei Mate 30 earlier this year</a>, which launched without Google Services support, the AppGallery could soon become the only way to download apps to Huawei and Honor smartphones.</p>
      <p>And that seems to be a firm focus for the company.</p>
      <p>“Operating system is not the difficult part,” said Akhram Mohamed, Huawei CBG CTO for SA.</p>
      <p>“On a consumer level, they don’t really engage on the OS level, but rather the app level.”</p>
      <p>It noted that 350-billion apps have been downloaded by users from the AppGallery since its inception.</p>
      <p>But which apps are the most popular in South Africa?</p>
      <p>DStv Now is currently the biggest video app on AppGallery, seeing 72 000 downloads in the past two weeks.</p>
      <p>Takealot is the top shopping app in South Africa, with a 20% monthly increase in downloads. It currently sits at 214 000 downloads.</p>
      <p>News24’s app has been downloaded 52 000 times, the company added, while another video app called Viu has seen 100 000 downloads in a month.</p>
      <p>“We are not forgetting about South Africa. South Africa is an incredibly important market for us,” Mohamed added.</p>
      <p>This promise also comes after the <a href="http://memeburn.com/2019/05/huaweis-appgallery-to-feature-more-south-african-made-apps/">company confirmed in May</a> that more apps from local developers will be featured on the AppGallery in the future.</p>
      <p>Huawei also shed light on its market share in South Africa at its Developer Day, which continues on Thursday.</p>
