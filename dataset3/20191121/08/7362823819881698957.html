      <h1>Trump hosted secret White House dinner with Zuckerberg</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:07:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:07</time> by <a rel="author">New York Post</a></address>
      <p>Facebook CEO <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mark-zuckerberg">Mark Zuckerberg</a> attended a secret dinner at the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">White House</a> last month with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/executive/white-house">President Trump</a> and tech investor Peter Thiel, the social media company confirmed on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>The previously undisclosed meeting in October between the social media mogul and the president was first reported by NBC News, who cited a statement from the company.</p>
      <p>“As is normal for a CEO of a major U.S. company, Mark accepted an invitation to have dinner with the President and First Lady at the White House,” a Facebook spokesperson said.</p>

      <p>It’s not clear why Trump entertained Zuckerberg and Thiel, who was a major donor to the president’s 2016 campaign and one of the most outspoken conservatives in Silicon Vally.</p>
      <p>Zuckerberg previously met with Trump in the Oval Office in September, which Facebook later described as a “constructive” meeting.</p>
      <p>“He also had a good, constructive meeting with President Trump at the White House today,” the spokesperson said after the Sept. 19 meeting.</p>

      <p>Trump tweeted about the Sept. meeting and included an image from the Oval Office: “Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.”.</p>
