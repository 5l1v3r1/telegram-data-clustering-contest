      <p><b>Bala Box Office:</b> Ayushmann Khurrana, Bhumi Pednekar &amp; Yami Gautam starrer <i>Bala</i> had another rock steady day at the Box Office. The film collected <b>1.96 crores</b> on its 13th day thus taking the total to <b>97 crores.</b></p>
      <p>The film is now very close to the <b>100 crores</b> mark and it will get even closer today. Meanwhile, the film has already made a beautiful entry in <b><a href="https://www.koimoi.com/box-office/all-time-grossers/koimoi-top-100-highest-bollywood-box-office-grossers-since-2012/">Koimoi’s Top 100 Box Office Grossers</a></b> by surpassing almost 13 films. And now it has taken another leap recently.</p>

      <p><i>Bala</i> has crossed the lifetime business of Akshay Kumar’s 2015 action thriller <i>Baby</i> which did a business of <b>95.50 crores</b> at that time. <i>Bala</i> has also equaled the lifetime business of 2015 comedy <i>Welcome Back.</i></p>
      <p>The next targets of <i>Bala</i> are <i>Batla House</i> <b>(97.18 crores),</b> <i>Zero</i> <b>(97.50 crores)</b> &amp; <i>Shivaay</i> <b>(100.35 crores)</b> which are not far.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Bhumi Pednekar recently said that her on-screen jodi with Ayushmann Khurrana, with whom she has worked in hits like <i>Dum Laga Ke Haisha, Shubh Mangal Saavdhan</i> and now <i>Bala</i>, is definitely fortunate.</p>
      <p>“Ayushmann and I are definitely a fortunate on-screen jodi to be getting so much love and adulation for audiences. We complement each other as artistes and we do have a very good on-screen chemistry. It just shows and I’m just glad that people have loved us as a pair and we have just done three films together,” Bhumi said.</p>
      <p>She says both of them have grown as actors during the course of their three back-to-back films.</p>
      <p>“From <i>Dum Lag Ke Haisha</i> (dealing with body shaming) to <i>Shubh Mangal Saavdhaan</i> (about erectile dysfunction in men) to <i>‘Bala’</i> (about premature balding and the stereotyping that dark-skinned women face in India), we have only been paired in films that tackle taboo topics so I think the equity of our pairing lies in bringing out real, societal issues told in the most honest and entertaining manner possible,” she added.</p>
