      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/usdchf"><b>USD/CHF</b></a> despite the recovery, the market remains offered while capped by the .9963 6 month downtrend and attention on the .9844/41 September and October lows. Failure at the next lower .9799 September low would push key support at .9716/.9659 to the fore. This is the location of the January, June, mid- and late August lows. Below here sits the .9659 August low and the September 2018 low at .9543”.</p>
