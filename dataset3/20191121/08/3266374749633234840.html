      <h1>Barcelona set to rival Bayern Munich in race to appoint Mauricio Pochettino</h1>

      <h3>Barcelona have reportedly joined Bayern Munich in pursuit of Mauricio Pochettino, who is now available after being sacked by Tottenham.</h3>
      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10389598/barcelona-mauricio-pochettin-spurs-boss/">The Sun</a>, Mauricio Pochettino is a popular man among clubs seeking a new manager. The former Tottenham boss is the subject of interest from Barcelona, who are set to rival Bayern Munich in his pursuit.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is widely regarded as one of the best young managers in world football at present, having overseen a transformation in Tottenham’s fortunes over the last half-a-decade or so. From being outside contenders for top four, the Argentine went on to establish Spurs as Champions League regulars, even reaching the final of Europe’s premier club competition this year.</p>
      <p>But, 2019 has also been a tumultuous year as far as the Premier League is concerned. Without an away win all year long so far and languishing at 12th on the table, Tottenham were off to a horrible start to the season. And, the relationship ran its course this week, with the North Londoners parting ways with Pochettino, who has <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/20/official-tottenham-hotspur-confirm-jose-mourinho-appointment/">since been replaced by Jose Mourinho</a>.</p>

      <p>For Pochettino, though, it is time to look towards pastures anew following the end of a memorable spell with Tottenham. And, the newly available manager does not have any shortage of big name suitors, with Barcelona and Bayern Munich having their sights set on him.</p>
      <p>At Barcelona, Ernesto Valverde has been under pressure since the start of the season, with his side faltering early on before gradually finding their feet. But, the report suggests that Valverde’s job is not safe yet and Barcelona have, thus, identified Pochettino as a possible replacement.</p>
      <p>Bayern Munich, on the other hand, have been keen on the 47-year-old for quite some time now, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/13/tottenham-boss-mauricio-pochettino-on-bayern-munichs-radar">with interest in him only furthering upon the sacking of Niko Kovac</a>. For now, Hansi Flick is in temporary charge of the Bundesliga champions, although it is likely that a new permanent manager will be appointed in the summer.</p>
      <p>Barcelona, though, are the ones who have stepped up their efforts to land Pochettino with The Sun claiming that the <i>Blaugrana</i> are more serious with their interest in the former Tottenham boss. But, the Argentine has previously asserted that he could not bring himself to managing Barcelona, as he is loyal to their local rivals Espanyol.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see if Pochettino takes up the opportunity to manage the La Liga champions, should they make him an offer. Alternatively, it also remains to be seen if Bayern Munich make any concrete efforts to appoint him and beat Barcelona to his signature.</p>
