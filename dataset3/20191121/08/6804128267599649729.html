      <h1>Christian Pulisic, Antonio Rudiger, Ross Barkley - Latest Chelsea injury news ahead of Man City</h1>
      <h2>The latest injury news for Chelsea as they travel to face champions Manchester City after the international break</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Harbord, Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea are back in action this weekend with a trip to the Etihad Stadium to face Premier League champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Fourth plays third in the table on Saturday evening as the battle to chase down Liverpool at the top of the league intensifies.</p>
      <p>A win for Frank Lampard's side could send them second in the table should Leicester fail to beat Brighton in the 3pm kick-off, while Liverpool will be looking to extend their lead at the top of the table with a trip to Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>Having as many players available as possible could be key to getting a positive result, but the Blues do have some injury concerns ahead of the trip, with as many as five players potentially unavailable.</p>
      <p>With that said, here's the latest Chelsea injury news and expected return dates.</p>
      <h3>Christian Pulisic</h3>
      <p>Chelsea face an anxious wait to discover the full extent of Christian Pulisic's hip injury after USA head coach Gregg Berhalter confirmed the winger would miss their international matches.</p>
      <p>"Christian is officially at this stage ruled out," he said.</p>
      <p>"We just got that information. This was a collaborative decision with the club looking after the best interest of the player.</p>

      <p>"These decisions are always difficult because this group and the coaching staff want nothing more than to have Christian here, but it was a risk we weren’t willing to take at this time."</p>
      <p>Pulisic confirmed via his Twitter account that he is in London, with <a href="https://www.premierinjuries.com/injury-table.php">PremierInjuries</a> rating the American's chance of being fit for the match against Manchester City at 25%.</p>
      <p>He has been in fine form for the Blues in recent weeks, with his goal against Crystal Palace on Saturday his fifth of the season, and will be a big loss to Lampard should he not recover in time for the trip to the Etihad.</p>
      <h3>Antonio Rudiger</h3>
      <p>Antonio Rudiger had appeared to have given Frank Lampard a welcome injury boost by declaring himself fit for the Blues' recent trip to Watford.</p>
      <p>The German centre back underwent knee surgery in the summer and has missed a good majority of the season, but won't be available until at least after the international break following an operation at the beginning of the week.</p>
      <p>"He had an operation and he is going to be out probably for three weeks, hopefully,"<a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/lampard-chelsea-press-conference-live-17218718">Lampard confirmed at his pre-Crystal Palace press conference</a>. "Then we will have to see where match fitness comes in because he has been out for a long time now.</p>

      <p>"It was nice to get something definitive about it because we have been trying to find a solution and he has been having some issues. It is not easy for a player in that position. So hopefully we are at that stage and hopefully in three weeks time we are in a lot better place."</p>
      <p>Rudiger is not likely to face Manchester City, but could be available for selection next month.</p>
      <h3>Ross Barkley</h3>
      <p>Barkley has not featured since the 1-0 win against Newcastle United last month.</p>
      <p>He has been missing since after picking up an ankle injury in the victory, with Lampard confirming that Barkley wouldn't be fit enough to make the squad for the visit of Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p>The England international was initially called up to Gareth Southgate's squad for the international fixtures against Montenegro and Kosovo over the international break.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>But, the midfielder was forced to pull out of the Three Lions squad prior to the first of two matches, due to the injury.</p>
      <p>That means that Berkley remains a doubt for the City clash.</p>

      <h3>Ruben Loftus-Cheek</h3>
      <p>Loftus-Cheek was establishing himself as a key member of Maurizio Sarri's squad at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>However, in the post-season friendly ahead of the Europa League final, Loftus-Cheek suffered the same injury as Hudson-Odoi as he ruptured his Achilles' tendon.</p>
      <p>The midfielder is still undergoing rehabilitation, with Loftus-Cheek working towards a return as soon as possible.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"It’s going well!" he recently told <a href="https://versus.uk.com/2019/11/im-coming-back-stronger-ruben-loftus-cheek-ready-return-already-eyes-euro-2020/">Versus</a> when asked about his recovery from injury.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a long time and I’ve had a few setbacks as well. It’s never been just a straight path but I’m close now…I’ve been running and moving, I feel I’m right on the edge. I’m close and I can’t wait."</p>
      <p>However, Lampard has <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/players/rudiger-loftus-cheek-chelsea-injuries-17225279">warned it could still be a while yet before the midfielder</a> is available for selection.</p>
      <p>A conditional return date of mid December has been suggested by PremierInjuries, with a possible return coming in the Premier League clash against Bournemouth.</p>

      <h3>Marco van Ginkel</h3>
      <p>The midfielder is a long term absentee, as he continues his rehabilitation following an anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p>
      <p>The Dutchman is on the way to recovery, having posted a video of himself working on the anti-gravity treadmill at the club's training ground.</p>

      <p>However, there is no return date provided for the 26-year-old as yet.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea should welcome back <b>Jorginho</b> after the international break, with the midfielder available for selection again after serving a one-match suspension and in fine form for Italy, scoring and creating another in a 9-1 win against Armenia.</p>
      <p><b>Callum Hudson-Odoi </b>was substituted in the second half of England's match at Kosovo on Sunday, but there is no reported injury for the Chelsea man.</p>
      <p><b>N'Golo Kante</b> has had his injury problems of late, but the Frenchman started for Didier Deschamps' side against Moldova on Thursday, and was an unused substitute against Albania on Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>Emerson </b>was not in the squad for Italy's second match of the international squad, however there doesn't seem to be much concern over an injury for the Italian.</p>
