        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 21 – Sh5 million is up for stake for this year’s 2019 Magical Kenya Ladies Open, a Ladies European Tour event that takes place from December 5-8 on the PGA Baobab Course at Vipingo Ridge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Announcing the prize purse, event promoter Dirk Glittenberg said that the purse was globally competitive.</p>
      <p>“This is the first time a Ladies European Tour event is being held in Kenya and we are delighted that we have received the necessary support to enable us to host this event and offer a globally acceptable and attractive prize purse.</p>
      <p>“Professional golfers choose which tournaments to play in based on a variety of factors – course condition, hospitality is important, convenience of getting to the venue, the overall experience expected and naturally the prize purse plays a big part in that decision-making process.”</p>

      <p>The Sh33 million prize fund for the tournament positions the event as one of the richest on the Ladies European Tour.</p>
      <p>The South Africa Women’s Open, played in Cape Town, offers a prize fund of Sh13.6 million and the Lalla Meryem Cup, played at the Royal Dar Es Salam Blue Course in Morocco, offers a prize fund of Sh50.5 million.</p>
      <p>“There are 17 events on the Ladies European Tour calendar, excluding the Majors, eight of those offer a smaller prize purse than the Magical Kenya Ladies Open, four offer more and another four offer the same prize fund of Euros300,000,” Glittenberg added.</p>
      <p>“We however understand that these professional golfers will also be driven to this beautiful country by factors over and above the prize purse and we know they will have a great time in Kenya. They can visit the beautiful beaches and game parks, enjoy the coastal cuisine and take away with them an experience of a lifetime.”</p>
      <p>Ladies European Tour Chair Marta Figueras-Dotti commented: “The announcement of the Magical Kenya Ladies Open is a proud moment for everyone at the Ladies European Tour and we are excited to help Kenya build its reputation as a preferred golf destination for women and girls.</p>
      <p>“Earlier this year, 12 of our members made a special appearance in Kenya to play in two Pro-Ams at Vipingo Ridge. The enthusiasm generated by the event made us determined to make this tournament a reality. Our grateful thanks to U.COM Event and the Government of Kenya for embracing the women’s game and for welcoming us to the Republic of Kenya for the first time.”</p>
