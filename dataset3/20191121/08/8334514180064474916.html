      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian authorities have arrested 680 Chinese nationals suspected of operating an extensive online fraud operation cheating people in their homeland, officials said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A team of 150 Immigration Department officers raided the suspects’ well-guarded headquarters in the town of Cyberjaya on Wednesday, the director general of the Immigration Department, Khairul Dzaimee Daud, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>About 100 suspects managed to escape, and some were hurt in the melee, Khairul said. The gang was believed to have operated from the premises for about six months.</p>
      <p>“The modus operandi of this syndicate is to target victims in China,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They are offered high and quick profits. The operators send a code to customers of a Mandarin-language website. All transactions were done through WeChat Pay or banks in China.”</p>
      <p>The Immigration Department said this was believed to have been be the largest ever online scam by Chinese nationals in Malaysia.</p>
