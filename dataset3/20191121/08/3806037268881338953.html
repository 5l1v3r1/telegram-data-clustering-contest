      <p>Following a hugely successful reissue of one of its most iconic models from 1979 — <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/5/timex-1979-q-timex-reissue">the Q Timex</a> — American watchmaker <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/timex">Timex</a> is now releasing yet another ’70s-era reissue: the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/q-timex-reissue-falcon-eye">Q Timex Falcon Eye</a>.</p>
      <p>Crafted in stainless steel, the 38mm casing houses an elegant electric-blue dial surrounded by a gold metal ring and acrylic window, creating that throwback two-tone aesthetic whilst allowing the timepiece to be water-resistant up to 50 meters. On the dial itself are gold hour markers and hands, all coated with luminescent paint for easy reading in low light conditions. Similar to its predecessor, it also holds the “Q Timex” and “Quartz” tags, as well as a day and a date window at 3 o’clock. A functional battery hatch sits neatly on the caseback, allowing access into the quartz movement — a signature of the collection. Finally, tying the watch together is a period-correct stainless steel bracelet with an adjustable clasp.</p>
      <p>For the vintage watch lovers out there, the Q Timex Reissue Falcon Eye is now available over at <a href="https://www.timex.com/q-timex-reissue-falcon-eye-38mm-stainless-steel-bracelet-watch/Q-Timex-Reissue-Falcon-Eye-38mm-Stainless-Steel-Bracelet-Watch.html">Timex</a>, going for $180 USD.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in watches, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/mad-paris-black-rolex-daytona-rainbow-sapphire-watch-110k-usd-release-information">MAD Paris has crafted a $110,000 USD Rolex Daytona Rainbow Sapphire</a>.</p>
