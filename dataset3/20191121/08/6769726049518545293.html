      <h1>‘Rather be dead’ than deal with NDIS: user</h1>

      <p>VERITY Warn says she’d rather be dead than deal with National Disability Insurance Scheme and its managing agency.</p>
      <p>Ms Warn, who has PTSD, told a parliamentary inquiry into the NDIS that she had been “bullied, berated, intimidated and lied to” as she dealt with bureaucrats in the scheme.</p>
      <p>“They’ve won. I’ve given up,” Ms Warn said.</p>
      <p>She frequently broke down into tears as she delivered her testimony in the inquiry, saying she struggled to deliver care for both her and her daughter, also on the NDIS.</p>
      <p>“I am quite clear that I would rather be dead than deal with more of this,” Ms Ward said.</p>
      <blockquote>“I think of suicide whenever I imagine further engagement with NDIA.</blockquote>
      <p>“At the end of the day I can’t figure out whether we’re all suffering at the hands of cruel stupidity or stupid cruelty.”</p>
      <p>NDIA deputy chief executive Vicki Rundle said about four out of five NDIS participants had plans created by contractors, though these had to be signed off by a NDIA delegate.</p>
      <p>Ms Rundle said the other 20 per cent of participants had complex needs and required face to face meetings with NDIA specialists.</p>
      <p>“At that point the (co-ordinators) will contact us,” Ms Rundle said.</p>
      <p>She also said it was her “intention” for participants and their families to be sent draft copies of their plans before they sit down for meetings.</p>
      <p>Committee members told bureaucrats at the hearing they had received complaints from participants and carers that they often sat down with planners with a finished draft plan put in front of them, often not getting any input in the process.</p>
      <p>Dougie Herd, who uses the <a href="https://www.ndis.gov.au/">NDIS</a>, said he had better dealings with banks than with his coordinator.</p>
      <p>Mr Herd said had a 90 minute conversation with his co-ordinator, filled out the paperwork but never saw his draft plan until he was due to sign off on it.</p>
      <p>“It’s very simple, just show it to me, have a conversation with me and let me – as a sentient human being – have a final observation,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s unacceptable I should only see my plan once it’s been agreed to by someone I’ve never met.”</p>
