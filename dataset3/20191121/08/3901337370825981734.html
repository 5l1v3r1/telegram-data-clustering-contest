      <p>Bruce Bvuma will need to step up to the plate this weekend, as he fills in for the suspended Daniel Akpeyi in a must-win clash.</p>
      <p>Kaizer Chiefs will lock horns with Maritzburg United in the semi-finals of the Telkom Knockout competition, with the club under pressure to deliver silverware this season.</p>

      <p>Akpeyi has been Chiefs’ number one man between the sticks ever since Itumeleng Khune’s troubling injury and now with the Nigerian international sitting out due to suspension, 24-year-old Bvuma will have to take on the responsibility.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an exclusive feature with Soccer Laduma, former Chiefs shot-stopper, William Shongwe explained how Amakhosi are able to get through this weekend’s hurdle.</p>
      <p>“You must remember that Akpeyi operated under a lot of pressure at the beginning of the season,” Shongwe said.</p>
      <p>“Somehow he managed to do his fair share and regained his confidence. Now, suddenly, he’s the main man and everyone loves and appreciates him. For what this game is all about and how Chiefs have been playing, I think they can actually believe that things will work out fine for them,” he added.</p>
