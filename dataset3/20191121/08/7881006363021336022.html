      <p><b>New Delhi</b>: Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Thursday exuded confidence that NCP, Congress, and his party will form government in Maharashtra before December 1 and once again asserted that the chief minister will be from Sena.</p>
      <p>He also informed that three parties will collectively decide about power-sharing in Mumbai.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"The time has come, before December 1 the process of formation of the government will be over and the Chief Minister will also be decided. Till yesterday, marathon meetings of Congress-NCP were held here at the NCP Chief Sharad Pawar's residence. In the next two days we will move ahead towards government formation," said Sanjay Raut.</p>
      <p>"The three parties will collectively decide on power-sharing in Mumbai," he added.</p>
      <p>"The chief minister will be of Shiv Sena. People want Uddhav Thackeray to be the Chief Minister," said Raut.</p>
      <p>A meeting of Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders was held at NCP chief Sharad Pawar's residence on Wednesday over the government formation in Maharashtra.</p>
      <p>Leaders from both the parties were present including Ahmed Patel, KC Venugopal, Mallikarjun Kharge, Jairam Ramesh, Supriya Sule among others.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra came under President's Rule after all the parties failed to form a government in the state.</p>
      <p>BJP, which emerged as the single largest party, could not stake claim to form a government as its ally Shiv Sena remained firm on rotating the chief minister's post and equal sharing of Cabinet berths.</p>
      <p>Shiv Sena parted its ways with BJP only to explore ways to form a government. It, however, failed to prove the support of the required number of MLAs in the time given by Governor BS Koshyari.</p>
      <p>The Governor had then invited NCP, the third-largest party, to prove its ability to form the government failing which President's Rule was imposed in the state.</p>
      <p>The Shiv Sena is now in parleys with the Congress and NCP to form a government in the state.</p>
      <p>The BJP won 105 seats in the 288-member assembly followed by Shiv Sena 56, NCP 54 and Congress 44.</p>
