      <p>He tracks Jimmy down via social media and visits his home and office in Cape Town, but does not confront him.</p>
      <p>Wiggett indicates that he would be dedicating his time to finding other alleged victims of sexual abuse or rape in order to build up a strong case against Jimmy and expose him publicly. </p>

      <p>Wiggett reveals in his second podcast that "Jimmy" was a teacher at Grey College in Bloemfontein in 1989 and 1990.</p>
      <p>This forms part of "seven lost years" that "Jimmy" had omitted from his CV.</p>

      <hr/>
      <p>After a long and frustrating investigation, Wiggett makes a breakthrough when he is contacted by a former pupil who is willing to reveal incidents of a sexual nature involving pupils at the school.</p>
      <p>While a former colleague, Ingo Machts, recalls "Jimmy", he does not recall any complaints against him nor the circumstances under which he left the school.</p>
      <p>Former headmaster Dr Michau Heyns does not recall "Jimmy" at all. </p>
      <p>
        <b>November 19</b>
      </p>
      <p>In anticipation of the unmasking of "Jimmy", News24 attempts to contact him. His cellphone has been disconnected and he does not reply to electronic messages. </p>
      <p>Calls and messages to his life partner and close colleagues go unanswered. </p>
      <p>News24 calls "Jimmy's" mother who passes the phone to a man who claimed to be his brother. The man tells News24 that "Jimmy" had left for Port Elizabeth on November 15 for meetings. He could not supply a contact number or provide details as to his whereabouts. </p>
      <p>
