      <p>Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta has wished <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/JoseMourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> well as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/TottenhamHotspur">Tottenham Hotspur</a>’s new manager.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been named as Mauricio Pochettino’s successor, signing a three-and-a-half-year deal at the north London club.</p>
      <p>He met his new players following his hasty appointment, which was announced less than 12 hours after Pochettino was sacked, on Wednesday and then took training ahead of his first game in charge at West Ham on Saturday.</p>
      <p>And Azpilicueta, who worked with Mourinho at Chelsea, has said that he hopes the Portuguese does well at Spurs.</p>
      <p>“I can talk only when Jose was here at Chelsea with us,” Azpilicueta told <i>Sky Sports News</i>.</p>
      <p>“We won trophies, and now football moves on. I wish him all the best even though he goes to a rival.</p>
      <p>“I have good memories with him and I have played many times under him and against him.</p>
      <p>“Obviously when we play against each other we both want to win for our teams, but this is football. I wish him well.”</p>
