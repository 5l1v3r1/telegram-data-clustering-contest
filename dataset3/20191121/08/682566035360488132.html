      <p>Du Plessis, 37, is likely to move to the Lions for next year's Super Rugby competition, with the Johannesburg-franchise earlier this week confirming they were in talks with the front-ranker.</p>
      <p>News of Du Plessis' surprise move to Johannesburg first broke over the weekend when Afrikaans newspaper <b><a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Rugby/jannie-en-carlu-kan-leeus-se-skrums-spierkrag-gee-20191116">Rapport</a></b> reported that the Lions were in talks with him and Stormers prop <b>Carlu Sadie.</b></p>
      <p>Du Plessis, who played 70 Tests for the Springboks between 2007 and 2015, has been at Montpellier since 2015.</p>
      <p>Before that, he played 119 Super Rugby games for the Sharks between 2008 and 2015, having started his professional career at the Cheetahs in 2003.</p>
      <p>Sadie, 22, joined the Lions on a loan deal for the 2019 Super Rugby season, but was ordered to return to play for Western Province in the Currie Cup.</p>
      <p>The Lions open their 2020 Super Rugby campaign against the Jaguares in Buenos Aires on February 1.</p>
