      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:20:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Everton forward Moise Kean has been advised to seek a club who will give him more playing time than the Toffees are currently doing by Italy manager Roberto Mancini.</p>
      <p>Kean joined the Merseysiders from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> in the summer for a fee of Â£24.75m but has yet to open his account at the club in nine Premier League appearances.</p>
      <p>He was dropped from the squad altogether for the win against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> after turning up late for a team meeting and his father also said he thought <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/moise-keans-dad-demands-everton-20893178">the move to Everton was a "mistake"</a> .</p>
      <p>Kean has won three caps for Italy, scoring two goals, but has not appeared for the <i>Azzurri</i> since March, and speaking to <a href="https://www.raisport.rai.it/">Rai Sport</a> manager Mancini said he may need to seek a move from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> if he wants to make his Euro 2020 squad.</p>

      <p>"I hope he can find a club that lets him always play: if so, he's one of the players who can come to Euro 2020, but it depends on what he does from now until May," the ex <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> boss said.</p>
      <p>Kean impressed for Italy Under-21s on Tuesday, scoring twice in a 6-0 win over Armenia, and Toffees fans will be hoping he can bring his form at international level to the Premier League.</p>
      <p>He impressed at Juventus last season, scoring six goals in 13 Serie A appearances, but so far his move to England has not worked out.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/moise-kean-blasts-father-after-20911422">He hit out at his father's comments over his move</a> , insisting in a post on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> that he was capable of turning his poor form around.</p>
      <p>He wrote in Italian: "Don't talk about my life when yours is not an example. I don't fear the hard times when the best comes (after) them."</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Kean will return to the Everton squad for the game against Norwich on Saturday.</p>
