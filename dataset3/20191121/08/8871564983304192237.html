      <h1>Pope meets Thai Buddhist patriarch on visit promoting religious peace</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:00:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/AFP" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Pope Francis met with Thailand’s supreme Buddhist patriarch on Thursday in a gilded Bangkok temple on the first full day of his Asia tour aimed at promoting religious harmony.</p>
      <p>This is the pontiff’s first visit to Buddhist-majority Thailand — where just over 0.5 percent of the population are Catholics — before he jets off to Japan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He is pushing a message of inter-faith peace on a four-day visit that will see him lead a mass later Thursday for tens of thousands of faithful from across Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>The 82-year-old head of the Catholic church also delivered impassioned remarks about the plight of vulnerable children and women who he said deserved a “dignified” future.</p>

      <p>In a highly symbolic meeting Thursday, he sat down with Thailand’s supreme Buddhist patriarch Somdej Phra Maha Muneewong at Bangkok’s Ratchabophit temple in the city’s historic old quarter.</p>
      <p>“Catholics have enjoyed freedom in religious practice, despite their being in a minority, and for many years have lived in harmony with their Buddhist brothers and sisters,” the Pope said in a speech at the meeting.</p>
      <p>The pair sat before a brilliant gold Buddha statue inside the ornate temple, built 150 years ago by the former Thai King — the supreme patriarch barefoot and draped in orange robes as they spoke.</p>
      <p>The Pope reciprocated the gesture, removing his shoes for part of the tete-a-tete.</p>
      <p>In an earlier speech, the Pope said the meeting was “a sign of the importance and urgency of promoting friendship and inter-religious dialogue”.</p>
      <p>It was the same temple visited by John Paul II on the last papal trip to Thailand in 1984.</p>
      <p>This visit coincides with the 350th anniversary of the founding of the “Mission de Siam”, marking the first visit by Catholic missionaries who arrived from Europe in the 17th century.</p>
      <p>Though Christianity’s first visitors were initially met with scepticism, today Thailand’s nearly 400,000 Catholics face little discrimination and the country is largely free of religious conflict.</p>
      <h3>Message for migrants</h3>
      <p>The head of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics met with Thailand’s Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha at a red carpet welcome ceremony at the government guest house, before addressing medical staff at Bangkok’s St Louis hospital.</p>
      <p>He was accompanied throughout the day by his cousin Sister Ana Rosa, who has lived in Thailand for decades and is helping the pontiff as a translator.</p>
      <p>At the hospital, he praised the valuable service “the Church offers to the Thai people, especially to those most in need”.</p>

      <p>Earlier he made a plea for the women and children “who are wounded, violated and exposed to every form of exploitation, enslavement, violence and abuse”, calling for a “dignified future” for the youth.</p>
      <p>Trafficking for sexual exploitation is rampant across southeast Asia, and most victims are young girls, according to the United Nations.</p>
      <p>He did not miss the opportunity to address the issue of migration, calling for the “safe, orderly, and dignified” movement of people in a region rife with human trafficking.</p>
      <p>The risks of illegal journeys abroad were laid bare last month when 39 Vietnamese migrants were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain.</p>
      <p>“It was heartbreaking; let us all pray for them,” the Pope said in a video message about the tragedy to a Vietnamese youth group.</p>
      <p>Later Thursday the Pope will lead a huge mass for tens of thousands of people, including ethnic Karen Christians from northern Thailand and Vietnamese Catholic refugees living in Bangkok.</p>
      <p>He will also meet Thailand’s King, before kicking off another full day Friday that will see him greet Catholic leaders and host a second mass.</p>
      <p>On Saturday he flies to Japan, where he will visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki, two cities devastated when the US dropped atomic bombs at the end of World War II in 1945.</p>
      <p>The pope, who years ago had hoped to be a missionary in Japan, has made strong calls for a ban on nuclear weapons.</p>
      <p>Since his election six years ago, Francis has made two trips to Asia, visiting the Philippines and Sri Lanka in 2014, followed by Myanmar and Bangladesh in 2017.</p>
