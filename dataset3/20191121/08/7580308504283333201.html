      <p>The Super Plaza on Akerele Street in Surulere area of Lagos was gutted by fire on Wednesday, destroying valuable merchandise, reports the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).<br/>NAN correspondent who was at the scene reports that many of the shop owners were seen packing out their goods, including, furniture, to reduce their losses.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that the plaza comprised of many shops and churches including Fountain Hall, Dominion City Worship, Omega Fire Ministries, Textiles and Fabrics, Bureau de Change and Gift Gallery, among others.</p>
      <p>A witness, Mr Abayomi Ayelomi, commended the effort of the Lagos State Fire Service and other emergency services who supported in putting out the fire, adding that the building was formally Super Cinema before it was converted to a shopping plaza.</p>
      <p>Director-General of Lagos Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Oke-Osanyintolu, said that preliminary investigation conducted on-site indicated that the fire resulted from an electrical surge in one of the shops before escalating to other parts of the plaza.</p>
      <p>“No loss of life nor injury has been sustained so far at the scene of the fire where properties worth a fortune have been lost to the inferno,” Oke-Osanyintolu said.</p>
