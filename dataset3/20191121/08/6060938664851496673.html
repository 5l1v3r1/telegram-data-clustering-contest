      <p>BRISBANE: Australia seized the advantage on the opening day of the first Test when they bowled Pakistan out for 240 just before stumps at the Gabba in Brisbane on Thursday.</p>

          <b>SCORECARD</b>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>After the visitors resisted stubbornly in the first session, reaching 57 for no wicket at lunch, pace trio <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Mitchell-Starc">Mitchell Starc</a> (4-52), <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Josh-Hazlewood">Josh Hazlewood</a> (2-46) and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/pat-cummins">Pat Cummins</a> (3-60) tore through the Pakistan batting order to put the home side in charge at the close of play.</p>
      <p>Australia seized the initiative after lunch when they reduced Pakistan from 75 for none to 78 for four, then 94 for five.</p>
      <p>Pakistan were rescued from disaster by Asad Shafiq, who played a lone hand, scoring 76 well-made runs.</p>
      <p>Shafiq came to the crease with his side 75 for two, then saw Haris Sohail (1) and Baba Azar (1) fall for the addition of only two runs.</p>
      <p>But good partnerships of 49 between Shafiq and Mohammed Rizwan, who made 37, and then 84 with Yasir Shah (26) enabled the visitors to achieve a respectable score.</p>
      <p>Rizwan, who was counter-attacking fearlessly, fell controversially with Cummins appearing to have just overstepped the mark, only for TV umpire Michael Gough to give the benefit of the doubt to the bowler.</p>
      <p>The visitors had frustrated the Australian pace attack in the first session, going into lunch at 57-0 with openers Azhar Ali and Shan Masood unbeaten on 28 and 21 respectively.</p>
      <p>The pair began to open up after the break with some sparkling attacking shots, but Hazlewood and Cummins at last found their length and began to turn the screws.</p>
      <p>The pressure began to tell and with the score on 75 Masood waved at a Cummins delivery outside off stump and edged to Steve Smith at second slip.</p>
      <p>Azhar went the next ball when he edged Hazlewood to Joe Burns at first slip, before Sohail and Azam both fell to poor shots.</p>
      <p>When Nathan Lyon had Iftikhar Ahmed caught at bat-pad for seven, Pakistan were reeling at 94 for five before Shafiq and Rizwan steadied the ship in the half-hour before tea.</p>
      <p>Pakistan earlier won the toss and chose to bat on a hot and humid morning in Brisbane.</p>
      <p>Azhar and Masood began cautiously against the Australian pace duo of Starc and Hazlewood, who bowled quickly without really troubling the Pakistan openers.</p>
      <p>The visitors crawled to 33 at the first drinks break and took almost two hours to reach 50, bringing up the half-century opening stand with a Masood boundary through square leg in the penultimate over before lunch.</p>
      <p>Pakistan had earlier caused a major surprise when they left out experienced seamer Mohammad Abbas, opting instead for pacemen Shaheen Afridi, Imran Khan and 16-year-old Naseem Shah, who were impressive in their lead-up game against Australia A.</p>
