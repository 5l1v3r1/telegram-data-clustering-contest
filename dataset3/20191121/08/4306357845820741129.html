      <h3>Manchester United could be forced to pay £85m to sign RB Salzburg striker Erling Braut Haaland, according to a report in England.</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/erling-braut-haaland-man-utd-transfer-85-million-january-bargain-a4291136.html">The Evening Standard</a> is reporting that Manchester United could be forced to pay close to their club transfer record to sign the Norwegian teenager.</p>
      <p>The same article states the Red Devils could see Haaland’s asking price “sky rocket” if the Premier League side wait until the end of the season to bid.</p>
      <p>According to the same story, the striker’s Austrian employers are demanding €100m (£85m) to sell the prized asset despite bringing Haaland to Salzburg in a £4.5m deal last year.</p>
      <p>The report goes on to say that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been promised significant funds to sign a striker in the upcoming transfer window given his lack of options in his current squad.</p>
      <p>The <i>Evening Standard</i> report continues by claiming that the Manchester United manager has asked the club’s scouts to keep a close eye on Haaland in the lead up to the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Manchester United could consider Everton forward Richarlison as an alternative should a move for Haaland fail to come to fruition, according to the same story.</p>
      <p>Haaland has scored 15 goals in 12 games in the Austrian top flight, while the Norway international has seven goals in four Champions League outings.</p>
