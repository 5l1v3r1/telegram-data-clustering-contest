      <p>One of Ghana’s big boy Ibrah One seems not to be done with Nana Appiah Mensah and his Menzgold Investment company as he has launched another attack on them.</p>
      <p>According to Ibrah One in his new post sighted, customers of Menzgold should forget about their monies which have been locked up for over a year because there won’t be any better outcome.</p>
      <p>He added though the matter is in court, he knows for sure that nothing better can come out.</p>
      <p>He posted: <i>“My dear Menzgold customers, it’s better you forget about your locked up money and channel your energy in making some new monies for yourself!</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>NAM 1’s court case will be dragged in court till 2022. Just another trick to escape paying you your monies.”</i>

        <i>“It’s too late now. When I was warning Menzgold customers long ago about what was coming, they thought I was rather the devil. Now you see.”</i>
