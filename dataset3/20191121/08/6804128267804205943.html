      <h2>Darren Fletcher has explained that Jose Mourinho will be different at Spurs after going 'too far' at Manchester United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:30</time> by <a rel="author">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>Former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher has explained how Jose Mourinho will be different at Tottenham compared to his time at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese boss was announced as Mauricio Pochettino's successor and is now preparing for his fourth stint in the Premier League, following his time at <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/manchester-united">United </a>and two stints at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a>'s previous spell with United did not go smoothly, despite winning the Europa League, and it was the first time he had failed to win a league title with a club since before he made a name for himself at Porto.</p>
      <p>While the stint at United left a sour taste in the mouth for many, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/darren-fletcher">Fletcher </a>explained that Mourinho did some soul-searching after his spell in the North West and expects a different approach in North London.</p>
      <p>"I think we'll see a slightly different Jose, he told BBC Radio 5Live.</p>
      <p>"I think the Jose that had been affected by Real Madrid and his almost resentment of players, which was different to when he was at Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan, he was a players' manager: 'Us against the world'. We've not seen that for a while.</p>
      <p>"I know for a fact that when he left United he did a little bit of reflecting and asked a few people to tell him what he was like, to give him the truth, to give it to him straight, and that, for me, is a sign of somebody who realised he went a little bit too far.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure he had his own frustrations with Manchester United, just as many as the players and people had towards him.</p>
      <p>"You could see towards the end from both points of view, but the fact that he was asking people for an honest opinion of what he was like says to me that it's someone who is reflecting.</p>

      <p>"A little bit of a rest and a bit of reflection, I think we'll see a different Jose Mourinho. I don't know whether it will be the Jose of old but I don't expect it to be the Jose we have seen for the last couple of years."</p>
