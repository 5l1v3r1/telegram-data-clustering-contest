      <p>Eight University of Victoria students on exchange programs in Hong Kong have returned to Canada, the university says.</p>
      <p>The students were studying with three partner universities in Hong Kong, including Hong Kong University, City University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, UVic said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The three institutions are closed for the remainder of the semester due to civil unrest, and are working to provide electronic alternatives so students can complete their coursework.</p>
      <p>UVic students who were planning to study in Hong Kong beginning in January are discussing alternatives.</p>
      <p>The University of British Columbia says it has cancelled its second term for exchange students in Hong Kong while it ensures the remainder of its students in region can get out.</p>
      <p>The university said 31 of its students were attending four universities in Hong Kong, where protests have grown increasingly violent, and now 20 of them have left the area.</p>
      <p>Vice-president for student affairs Ainsley Carry said the remaining 11 students are safe and accounted for, with six having firm departure plans, two working on travel plans and three staying in the area with family.</p>
