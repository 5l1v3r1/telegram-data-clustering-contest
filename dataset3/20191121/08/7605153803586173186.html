      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>The journalist identified as Eric Oloo worked with the Star Newspaper as the Correspondent for Siaya and was found in the house of the local OCS.</p>
      <p>“His body had stab wounds in the head,” a senior police officer said, “there are reports that he had an affair with the woman.”</p>
      <p>The woman and her boyfriend were arrested, as detectives commenced investigations into the murder believed to have been the results of a love triangle.</p>
      <p>The two are among three people being detained by police.</p>
      <p>According to Ugunja OCPD Ibrahim Muchuma, the late Oloo had three deep cuts on his head.</p>
      <p>Muchuma said the body was found inside the house of the police officer which is situated within Ugunja town and is just a stone’s throw from the station.</p>
      <p>He said the other two arrested are men one being a boyfriend to the female officer identified as Sabina Kerubo.</p>
      <p>“The three were inside the house at the time of the murder,” the OCPD said.</p>
      <p>Muchuma said the house had been marked as a crime scene.</p>
      <p>The body of Oloo was found on the bed with blood stains on cushions.</p>
      <p>According to neighbours, Oloo and Kerubo for sometimes had been cohabiting as husband and wife.</p>
      <p>A neighbor who sought to remain anonymous said the deceased had suspected that the officer was dating another man.</p>
      <p>“Two weeks ago, the deceased went and confronted the man he suspected to be having intimacy with the officer where he was beaten up,” the neighbour told reporters.</p>
      <p>Oloo is said to have gone to Kerubo’s house Wednesday night and found the officer with the man.</p>
      <p>The man, according to the neighbor called assistance from a friend with whose help he subdued Oloo and hit him to death.</p>
      <p>The body was moved to Ambira mortuary for a postmortem examination.</p>
