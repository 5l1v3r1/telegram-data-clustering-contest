      </p>
      <p>We’ve made it to November 2019, which means its time to revisit Ridley Scott’s <i>Blade Runner.</i> The sci-fi film (set in a wildly futuristic year 2019) stars Harrison Ford as an LA cop who reluctantly comes out of retirement to help hunt down six new replicants, or synthetic humans, who have revolted and are killing their masters.</p>
      <p>Despite receiving lukewarm reviews when it was released, the film as gone on to become regarded as a modern classic and one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, and is credited with founding the cyberpunk aesthetic and influencing future films like <i>Ghost In The Shell</i>.</p>
      <p>The film screening will be preceded by a one-hour lecture by Professor Ackbar Abbas on sci-fi writer William Gibson, cyberpunk culture, and <i>Blade Runner</i> before the screening.</p>

For more than 50 years, the walled city was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dj_8ucS3lMY">a source of fascination for observers</a>; it began as a squatter settlement, and later became known as the most densely populated place on earth, a lawless labyrinth where crime, commerce, and community co-existed.</p>
