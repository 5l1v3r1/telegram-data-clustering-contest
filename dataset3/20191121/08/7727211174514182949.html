      <p>Breakfast TV viewers have slammed <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/great-british-bake-off">Great British Bake Off</a> judge Prue Leith, who wants to ban packed lunches.</p>
      <p>The 79-year-old chef appeared on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV's</a> <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/good-morning-britain">Good Morning Britain</a> telling hosts Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard kids' lunch boxes are 'full of junk'.</p>
      <p>She said: "Some mums do a great job, but a lot fill lunch boxes with junk. I feel we should ban packed lunches."</p>
      <p>Prue said parents should not put treats in lunch boxes as they should be given once a week, not every day.</p>
      <p>Susanna said: "Once a week?"</p>
      <p>Prue said: "It depends, but I think if you have more than one sweet thing a day you are adding 400 cal to your days.</p>
      <p>"Chocolate and chips aren't bad, you just don't want it every day."</p>
      <p>Sian Griffiths, who works in schools was also on the show and did not agree with the former Great British Menu judge.</p>
      <p>She said: "I don't think banning packed lunches is a good idea.</p>
      <p>"A lot of school food is absolutely terrible. I go to schools a lot and just this week I was offered fish fingers, pizza, fried fish in batter and sausages and that's not health food."</p>

      <p>Prue said it should be up to schools to teach children about healthy food, but Sian said: "I think schools have got so much on their plate."</p>
      <p>Susanna asked: "Prue, do you not see some conflict here, as you are a judge on The Great British Bake Off?"</p>
      <p>Prue said: "Of course it is a very obvious one, but that is a competition.</p>
      <p>"Mothers shouldn't put a treat in to the lunches every week. I want to see lunches as a lesson.</p>
      <p>"In Finland the children sit down and are taught a lot about food, they are sitting down with teachers and they are learning, they don't know it is a lesson - it should be relaxing."</p>
      <p>But people watching at home were not impressed with her argument.</p>
      <p>One, @DoubleTreble_ said: " Everyday in school dinners they get a pudding, but kids on packed lunches should get a sweet treat once a week? What a load of rubbish."</p>
      <p>Another, @angryg21said: " Ban packed lunches? Have you seen the price of school dinners!????"</p>
      <p>A third, @cfitzy69 said: " @GMB Our sons school doesn’t allow chocolate or fizzy drinks in packed lunch. He has 2 pieces of fruit, a sandwich, fresh orange juice or water and a small bag of crisps. School dinners include pizza and chips. Which is more healthy?"</p>
      <p>Meanwhile @linsullivan610 said: " For many parents, it’s the cost of school meals that forces them to send packed lunches, my daughter had 3 having school meals and at the time it came to £30 per week, this eventually caused her to change to packed lunches as she could not afford over £100 per month."</p>
      <p>Many pointed out Prue's job, as one, @KimberleyW1983 said: " Woman who eats cakes for a living tries to ban packed lunches as they're "unhealthy"."</p>
      <p>Another, @AngryBritain said: " BREAKING: Woman who has made a living from baking calorie and sugar laden cakes tells Britain on #GMB we should only eat something sweet once a week #irony"</p>
