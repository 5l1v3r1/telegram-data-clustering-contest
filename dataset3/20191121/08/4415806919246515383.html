      <p>A man in his 30s has died following a collision in Tipperary.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said they were called to the scene of the single-car collision shortly after 3am.</p>
      <p>They said the collision occurred on the N24 at Killaloan on the outskirts of Clonmel.</p>
      <p>The driver of the car, a man in his 30s, was removed to South Tipperary General Hospital where he has since been pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Two passengers in the car, a man and woman both in their 20s, were also taken to hospital.</p>
      <p>Their injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.</p>
      <p>Gardaí said the road is currently closed to traffic and local diversions are in place.</p>
      <p>Garda forensic collision investigators and crime scene examiners have been requested to examine the crash site scene.</p>
      <p>They said a report will be forwarded to the local Coroner.</p>
      <p>Gardaí are appealing for witnesses to the collision.</p>
      <p>"From our initial enquiries it’s understood the car, a 05WH registered silver Volkswagen Polo, left the road and struck a wall while travelling from Clonmel in the direction of Carrick-on-Suir," said Superintendent William Leahy.</p>
      <p>"We are appealing for witnesses and in particular anyone who travelling on this stretch of road between 2.45am and 3.15am this morning to contact us at Clonmel Garda Station.</p>
      <p>"We would also ask any road user with camera footage to make it available to investigating gardaí."</p>
