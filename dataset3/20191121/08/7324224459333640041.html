      <h1>Gareth Barry hails West Brom medic marvels</h1>
      <h2>Gareth Barry says he is hugely thankful to Albion’s medical staff who worked tirelessly so he could continue playing.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:54:14+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>The midfielder underwent surgery on a knee injury towards the end of last season – with that operation potentially ending the 38-year-old’s career.</p>
      <p>Barry was actually released by the Baggies at the end of the 2018/19 campaign. But head coach Slaven Bilic told him he would get a new deal if he could prove his fitness.</p>
      <p>And the former England international revealed the club’s medical staff did absolutely everything they could to get him fit and back out on the grass.</p>
      <p>“I have a lot to thank the Albion medical staff for,” Barry said. “I was out of contract but they still worked tirelessly. There were a lot of sessions over the summer when they could have been on holiday.</p>
      <p>“A lot of work went into getting me right and there was a lot of pain in my knee so the thought of retiring comes into your head.</p>
      <p>“Thankfully that pain has gone and I’m in a position where I am feeling good.</p>
      <p>“You need reassurance sometimes from lots of different people.</p>
      <p>“You have to be patient but if you work hard then the rewards will come. I’m happy to have come out the other side.”</p>
      <p>Barry, who could feature against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday with Jake Livermore and Romaine Sawyers suspended, said at his age retirement would have been the easy option following his operation.</p>
      <p>But he said from the moment he went under the knife he knew he wanted to continue playing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve come through a few tough challenges but I didn’t want to finish my career on an injury and I’m happy to have been able to get my fitness back.”</p>
