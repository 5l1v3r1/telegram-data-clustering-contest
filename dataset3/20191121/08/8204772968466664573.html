      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=China">China</a> will strive to reach a “phase one” trade agreement with the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=United+States">United States</a> as both sides keep communication channels open, the Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday, in an attempt to allay fears talks might be unravelling.</p>
      <p>China is willing to work with the United States to resolve each other’s core concerns on the basis of equality and mutual respect, and will try hard to reach a phase one deal, Gao Feng, spokesman at the ministry, told reporters.</p>
      <p>“This is in line with the interests of both China and the United States, and of the world,” Mr Gao said.</p>
      <p>Economists warn that the prolonged trade dispute between China and the United States is escalating risks to the global economy by disrupting supply chains, discouraging investment and dampening business confidence.</p>
      <p>Completion of a phase one trade deal could slide into next year, trade experts and people close to the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=White+House">White House</a> told Reuters previously, as <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Beijing">Beijing</a> presses for more extensive tariff rollbacks and the US administration counters with heightened demands of its own.</p>
      <p>Officials from Beijing had suggested that Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump might sign a deal in early December.</p>
      <p>Some experts said the next date to watch was December 15th, when tariffs on about $156 billion in Chinese goods are set to take effect, including holiday gift items such as electronics and Christmas decorations.</p>
      <p>In a dinner speech in Beijing on Wednesday, Vice Premier Liu He said he was “cautiously optimistic” on a phase one deal, Bloomberg News said, citing people who attended the event ahead of a forum organised by Bloomberg LP.</p>
      <p>Liu, China’s chief negotiator at the Sino-US trade talks, separately told one of the attendees that he was “confused” about the US demands, but was confident the first phase of a deal could be completed nevertheless, Bloomberg added.</p>
      <p>A fresh row between Washington and Beijing over US legislation on <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Hong+Kong">Hong Kong</a> has also threatened to undermine their trade talks and delay a phase one deal that investors had initially hoped to be signed by now. – Reuters</p>
