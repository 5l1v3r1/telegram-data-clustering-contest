      <p>Following on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../pokemon-sword-and-shield-selling-fast-in-japan-further-boosts-switch-hardware-sales-573025.phtml">from yesterday's news</a> that <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i> shifted 1.3 million physical copies in Japan, The Pokémon Company has proudly announced that these latest entries in the legendary collect-'em-up franchise have succeeded in selling six million global units their release week. A little over two million of these sales came from North America during the first two days of launch<br/><br/>This number represents the highest ever week-one sales on the Nintendo Switch platform, making <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-pokemon-sword-573018.phtml"><i>Pokémon Sword and Shield</i></a> the fastest-selling Switch title to date. As noted yesterday, <i>Sword </i>and<i> Shield</i> are two separately listed games, and as such dedicated fans may choose to purchase both, which will understandably help boost these figures a little.<br/><br/>The success of both titles also led to a global surge in Switch hardware sales, with Japan selling over 180,000 Switch units during <i>Pokémon Sword and Shield's</i> release week. Since the start of November, the UK has seen a further 90,000 consoles, confirming <i>Pokémon</i>'<i>s</i> staying power as a "killer app", capable of shifting hardware as well as software.<br/><br/><i>Pokémon</i> Sword and Shield are available now on Nintendo Switch.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.pokemon.co.jp/corporate/PostImages/b1b2b7b4ea55eef149f2bc849c194eea958c68c6.pdf">Pokémon Sword and Shield sales top six million in first week</a> [Official / <a href="https://gematsu.com/2019/11/pokemon-sword-and-shield-sales-top-six-million-in-first-week">Gematsu</a>]</p>
