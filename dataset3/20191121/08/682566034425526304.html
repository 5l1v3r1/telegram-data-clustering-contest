      <p>Cape Town - <b>Absa Premiership</b> outfit <b>Cape Town City</b> may have landed themselves in hot water over comments criticising the <b>Premier Soccer League's (PSL) </b>decision to ban midfielder <b>Mpho Makola</b> for six-months.</p>
      <p>The former Orlando Pirates midfielder received the hefty suspension for pushing referee Abongile Tom in the Telkom Knockout defeat to Kaizer Chiefs.</p>
      <p>And City were less than impressed with the decision and slammed the disciplinary process conducted by prosecutor Nande Becker.</p>
      <p><i>"The premeditated aggressive nature of the proceeding was as harmful as the decision to ban Mpho for 6 months,"</i> <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/PSL/ct-city-makola-was-taken-advantage-of-by-psl-dc-20191115">City said in a statement released</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"The PSL prosecutor continued to emotionally and intellectually badger Mpho, who was determined to handle the proceeding without legal representation in an attempt to show that he was not there to fight his innocence, but rather to show unwavering remorse.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"Mpho was taken advantage of. It got to the point where the hearing had to be stopped completely so that a level of humanity and sanity could be expressed to the leagueâ€™s prosecutor Nande Becker in relation to his treatment towards Mpho, which was as aggressive as it was unnecessary to the technical proceedings."</i>
      </p>
      <p>But the Cape Town-based club may just have dug themselves a hole with those comments with the PSL poised to react punitively.</p>
      <p>"The comments made by Cape Town City are under consideration for possible further action by the League," Becker told <a href="https://www.kickoff.com/news/articles/south-africa-news/categories/news/premiership/psl-takes-legal-action-against-cape-town-city-for-mpho-makola-suspension-statement-regarding-nande-b/667828">KickOff</a>.</p>
      <p>"The matter has been re-enrolled for argument in respect of an appropriate sanction against the club. This hearing will take place on 26 November."</p>
      <p>City chairman John Comitis could not be reached for comment.</p>
