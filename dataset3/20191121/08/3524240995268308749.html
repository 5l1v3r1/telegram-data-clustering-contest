      <p>The National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party on Wednesday ratified the decisions of the governorship candidates of the party in Kogi State, Mr Musa Wada; and in Bayelsa State, Mr Douye Diri, to challenge at the election petitions tribunal, the result of the November 16 governorship elections as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>It added that there was no report against former President Goodluck Jonathan before it.</p>
      <p>The PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, said this in an interview with journalists in Abuja after the PDP NWC’s meeting. He stated that the NWC also reviewed the roles played by INEC and security agencies, adding that the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, would on Thursday (today) address a world press conference on the deliberations of the NWC.</p>
      <p>The PDP spokesman also said Secondus was not under any pressure to resign.</p>
      <p>Ologbondiyan said, “We deliberated on the elections  in Kogi and Bayelsa states and the highest level of the party led by the national chairman, will formally address the world on Thursday (today).</p>
      <p>“We have taken the decision of going to court but beyond that, we are going to take other measures  which the national chairman will address.</p>
      <p>“The issue of President Goodluck Jonathan did not come up at this meeting and it was not discussed. You  must know about the procedures and processes in our party. If we do not have a report or an issue before us, we cannot delve into. As we speak now, we do not have any matter concerning President Jonathan before the party.</p>
      <p>“The national chairman is not under any pressure (to resign) except the fact that we believe that democracy is gradually being killed by this government and we believe that as the main opposition party we have a responsibility to salvage democracy.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the PDP caucus in the Senate on Wednesday also rejected the Bayelsa and Kogi governorship elections’ results.</p>
      <p>The senators, led by the Minority Leader of the Senate, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, made the rejection known at a news conference in Abuja.</p>
      <p>“We are very disturbed by the elections that were held on Saturday in Bayelsa and Kogi states.</p>
      <p>“We totally reject the pronouncements after the elections by INEC and we are worried about the trend of what happened during the elections.</p>
      <p>“We know that the results that were announced were not a true reflection of what happened in the field.”</p>
      <p>The <i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> also reports that the caucus called on President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Inspector-General of Police and other security agencies to immediately fish out the killers of a PDP women leader in Kogi State, Salome Abuh, who was burnt in her house.</p>
      <p>“We hear that the police are launching an investigation but this is something we don’t want to be swept under the carpet because it involves life,” Abaribe said.</p>
