      <h1>'Climate emergency' has been named as Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year for 2019</h1>
      <h2>This year the entire shortlist was made up of 'climate language' and included 'climate denial,' 'eco-anxiety,' 'extinction' and 'flight shame'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:04:47+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:04</time> by <a rel="author">Katie Dickinson</a></address>
      <p>Oxford Dictionaries has named 'climate emergency' as its word of the year for 2019 after choosing it from an all-environmental shortlist.</p>
      <p>The Oxford Word of the Year is intended to highlight “a word or expression shown through usage evidence to reflect the ethos, mood, or preoccupations of the passing year, and have a lasting potential as a term of cultural significance".</p>
      <p>Past winners in recent years have included 'toxic,' 'youthquake,' post-truth,' 'vape' and 'emoji'.</p>
      <p>This year the entire shortlist was made up of 'climate language' and included 'climate denial,' 'eco-anxiety,' 'extinction' and 'flight shame'.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Oxford Dictionaries said that this year, heightened public awareness of climate science and the myriad implications for communities around the world has generated enormous discussion of what the UN Secretary-General has called "the defining issue of our time".</p>
      <p>But it is not just the upsurge in conversation that has caught Oxford's attention.</p>
      <p>Research reveals an increase in the language people are using to articulate ideas about climate.</p>
      <p>Analysis of language data collected in the Oxford Corpus shows the rapid rise of climate emergency from relative obscurity to becoming one of the most prominent – and prominently debated – terms of 2019.</p>
      <p>Usage of the phrase climate emergency increased steeply over the course of 2019, and by September it was more than 100 times as common as it had been the previous year. </p>
      <p>Casper Grathwohl, president of Oxford Dictionaries, said: “This has been a fascinating year for the word 'climate', and we see that reflected especially in the way that English-speakers have combined it with other words.</p>
      <p>"We are clearly struggling to articulate our climate anxiety. Language cannot seem to keep up with the accelerating sense of urgency around the issue, resulting in a rapidly evolving set of vocabulary with a new word vying for center stage at every turn.</p>
      <p>"To reflect this, we’ve not only selected a climate-related word this year - our entire shortlist has been chosen exclusively from the rich climate language surrounding us. Together these words tell the story of a rising issue, and of a public debate attuned to the power of language.”</p>
