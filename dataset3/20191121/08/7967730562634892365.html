      <h1>Dangerfield extends with Cats until 2024</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:44:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:44</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Ryan</a></address>
      <p>Patrick Dangerfield will be 34 by the time his new contract with Geelong expires after he extended with the Cats until the end of 2024.</p>
      <p>His decision to remain with the club is no surprise however, the recent spate of long-term contract extensions to key players shows Geelong is positioning their salary cap to ensure they have room to continue adding players through trades and free agency over the next few years.</p>
      <p>Dangerfield has been outstanding since joining the Cats from Adelaide via a trade after he expressed his wish to join Geelong as a free agent at the end of 2015.</p>

      <p>He won the 2016 Brownlow Medal and has twice finished runner-up (although he was ineligible to win the award due to suspension in 2017 when he polled enough votes to be second behind Richmond's Dustin Martin).</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old has now earned seven All-Australian selections and is considered one of the era's best players.</p>

      <p>Cats football manager Simon Lloyd said Dangerfield's contribution to the club was significant.</p>
      <p>"Since arriving through the doors of GMHBA Stadium, Patrick’s performance both on and off the field has been exceptional. His overall commitment to the club and will to compete has been outstanding," Lloyd said.</p>
      <p>"Patrick leads by example, highly motivated to further develop himself and invest in the growth of his teammates. His ability to perform at a consistent, elite level is something our young group aspire to."</p>
