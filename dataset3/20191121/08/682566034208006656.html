      <p>Cape Town - <b>Juventus</b> are reportedly willing to offer <b>Manchester United</b> two players and cash in an effort to bring <b>Paul Pogba</b> back to Turin.</p>
      <p>Pogba's future with the English Premier League side remains very much up in the air after he failed to get his wish of a move away from Old Trafford in the summer.</p>
      <p>Both Juve and Real Madrid were in the hunt to do a deal, but he ended up remaining with United, where his situation has not improved.</p>
      <p>In fairness, his season has been blighted by an injury that currently keeps him out of the side, and there is no sign of when he will return to the Reds starting line-up.</p>
      <p>It is doing nothing to help his situation and a move away from United in the very near future looks inevitable.</p>
      <p>A move in the January transfer window looks unlikely, but there is a chance united could agree to part company at the end of the season and the Bianconeri hope to be in the mix.</p>
      <p>It has also been claimed that Juve will offer two players, Emre Can and Mario Mandzukic, plus cash, in the hope that could swing a deal in their favour.</p>
      <p>It could tempt United, as Can is known to be a long-term target, while Mandzukic could be the experienced striker they have missed since selling Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>It has also been reported that Pogba would prefer to return to Turin over a switch to Real Madrid.</p>
