        <b>More than 1,350 Australian women have won a long-running class action lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) over vaginal mesh implants.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Australia's Federal Court found that J&amp;J subsidiary Ethicon failed to warn patients and surgeons about the "risks" posed by the products.</p>
      <p>The implants were commonly used to treat pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence after childbirth.</p>
      <p>The case is one of a series of lawsuits J&amp;J faces over the products.</p>
      <p>Some patients said they had suffered chronic pain, bleeding and severe discomfort during sexual intercourse after having the mesh surgically implanted.</p>
      <p>Judge Anna Katzmann ruled that much of the information the company provided about the products was "inaccurate" and at times made "false representations".</p>
      <p>"The risks were known, not insignificant and on Ethicon's own admission, serious harm could ensue if they eventuated," Ms Katzmann said in her ruling.</p>
      <p>The court will set damages next year.</p>

      <p>In a statement, Ethicon defended its record and said it would consider an appeal.</p>
      <p>"Ethicon believes that the company acted ethically and responsibly in the research, development and supply of these products," the company said.</p>
      <p>Julie Davis, the original claimant in the case, welcomed the decision.</p>
      <p>"They have treated women essentially like guinea pigs, lied about it and done nothing to help," she told reporters outside the court in Sydney.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Australian government issued a national apology to women affected by vaginal mesh, acknowledging decades of "agony and pain".</p>
      <h3>Mounting lawsuits</h3>
      <p>The ruling is the latest bad news for J&amp;J, which is facing billions of dollars in legal claims over other products, including opioids.</p>
      <p>In October, the company agreed to pay nearly $117m (Â£90.5m) to resolve claims over pelvic mesh in 41 US states and the District of Columbia.</p>
      <p>It is also facing lawsuits over the product in Canada and Europe.</p>
      <p>Separately, J&amp;J is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50101758">facing thousands of lawsuits from people who claim its talc products caused cancer.</a></p>
      <p>The multinational was also ordered to pay $8bn in damages to a man over claims he was not warned that an anti-psychotic drug could lead to breast growth.</p>
      <p>Despite the lawsuits, the company booked $20.7bn in quarterly sales in its most recent results, an increase of 1.9% over the same quarter in 2018.</p>
