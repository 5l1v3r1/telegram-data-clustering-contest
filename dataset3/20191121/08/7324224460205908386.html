      <h2>All he wants for Christmas is surgery for his cleft palette . . . and Arthur the bulldog puppy could be in luck.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:59:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/james-vukmirovic/" target="_blank">James Vukmirovic</a></address>
      <p>Staff at Cavan Vets in Oxley, Wolverhampton, are organising the Christmas fair as a way to raise funds to help Arthur, a bulldog puppy, receive surgery for a cleft palette.</p>
      <p>The surgery for Arthur's condition, which is an opening between the mouth and nose and which occurs when the tissues forming the palate do not fuse together properly, will cost more than £600 and, if it is not complete, could allow for food and fluid to enter the nasal cavity during feeding, potentially leading the way to serious complications.</p>

      <p>The fair, which will take place on Sunday, December 8, at the London Midland Railway Club Association, in Bushbury Lane, Bushbury, from 1.30pm will feature a Santa's grotto, a bric-a-brac and a number of stalls offering dog toys and other dog-related items such as adoption teddies.</p>
      <p>Abi Barton, who works as a veterinary nurse at the surgery, has led the organisation of the event as a way to help Arthur, as well as two other puppies called Ellie and Mable, who were born with severe mobility issues.</p>
      <p>She said: "We need to raise over £1,000 for Arthur's surgery and to ensure Ellie and Mable can have the correct diagnosis for their conditions.</p>
      <p>"We also deal a lot with stray animals and the money raised all goes into the pot to help them.</p>
