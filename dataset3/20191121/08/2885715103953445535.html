      <p>As <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/nayanthara/">Nayanthara</a> celebrated her 35th birthday earlier this week, a Malayalam channel decided to mark the occasion with a throwback video. The channel fished out an old video from its archives, which was Nayanthara’s first appearance on the cable TV network.</p>
      <p>The actor had hosted a segment called ‘Beauty Doctor’ for Kairali network. She appears less than five minutes in the 18 minutes segment. The old footage is also a testament to how far she has come.</p>
      <p>In an industry, where female actors often come and quickly vanish, Nayanthara has emerged a force to be reckoned. She did not just survive in the industry, but she also exceeded all the expectations. Now, she commands a significant fan following like her male counterparts. So much so that she is dubbed as the ‘Lady Superstar’ by the industry insiders, a reputation difficult to earn for female players in a male-dominated field.</p>
      <p>Nayanthara is dating director Vignesh Shivan, who directed her in 2015 hit Naanum Rowdy Dhaan. The couple was recently snapped celebrating Nayanthara’s birthday in New York.</p>
      <p>Nayanthara, who was last seen in Bigil, is currently waiting for the release of Darbar. The film is written and directed by AR Murugadoss and it is her first collaboration with Superstar <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajinikanth/">Rajinikanth</a> in more than a decade. The last time they both appeared on the big screen was Kuselan, which came out in 2008. She also has Netrikann and Mookuthi Amman in the pipeline.</p>
