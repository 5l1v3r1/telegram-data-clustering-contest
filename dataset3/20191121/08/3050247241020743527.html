      <h1>Binance ‘Buidls’ Bridge With India, Acquiring Leading Bitcoin Exchange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Marie Huillet</a></address>
      <p>Binance has acquired the well-known <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/india">Indian</a> <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies">crypto</a> exchange WazirX, bringing easier cryptocurrency access to a population of over one billion.</p>
      <p>According to an announcement <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/404105749895733248/Binance-Acquires-Indias-Leading-Digital-Asset-Platform-WazirX-to-Launch-Multiple-FiattoCrypto-Gateways">published</a> on Nov. 21, users will be able to use Indian rupees (INR) to buy and sell crypto via the Binance Fiat Gateway as early as Nov. 25.</p>
      <h3>Major morale boost for the Indian community</h3>
      <p>During the first quarter of 2020, WazirX’s auto-matching engine will be integrated into the Binance Fiat Gateway so that Binance.com users will be able to directly place orders on the flagship exchange to purchase Tether (<a href="https://coin360.com/coin/tether-usdt">USDT</a>) against INR. With this integration, any crypto tradeable on Binance.com will become accessible for those who purchase USDT via WazirX.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Cointelegraph, Kashif Raza — co-founder of the Indian crypto regulatory news and analysis platform “Crypto Kanoon” — welcomed the development, suggesting that the acquisition will provide a major morale boost to the Indian startup space at a time of deep <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-parliament-will-not-consider-total-crypto-ban-in-winter-session">regulatory uncertainty</a>.</p>
      <p>This uncertainty is highly likely to have played a role in WazirX’s decision to join forces with a major industry incumbent like Binance, he added.</p>
      <p>Back in July 2018 — in the aftermath of the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/reserve-bank-of-india">Reserve Bank of India’s</a> (RBI) <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-delhi-high-court-seeks-response-from-central-bank-on-recent-crypto-ban-report-says">controversial</a> ban on <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/indias-central-bank-to-stop-dealing-with-all-crypto-related-accounts-not-ban-on-crypto-commenters-say">banks' dealings</a> with crypto-related firms — WazirX had <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/bitcoin-investors-watch-out-for-rbis-july-5-deadline/articleshow/64840136.cms">transformed</a> its business model into a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/p2p">P2P</a> platform so as to avoid in-house crypto-fiat conversion.</p>
      <p>Other exchanges, like Coindelta, have since been forced to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-crypto-exchange-coindelta-shutters-services-citing-adverse-regulatory-conditions">terminate</a> services altogether in light of the adverse operating climate for crypto businesses in the country</p>
      <h3>“Another step forward in achieving the freedom of money”</h3>
      <p>In a statement, Binance Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhou remarked that “building fiat-to-crypto bridges remain a key mission for Binance,” adding that the acquisition of WazirX will help Binance in this mission “by providing a simple and cohesive way to purchase cryptocurrencies in a country which is home to more than a billion people."</p>
      <p>Binance’s chief executive Changpeng Zhao has said the move represents “another step forward in achieving the freedom of money.” </p>
      <p>As <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-parliament-will-not-consider-total-crypto-ban-in-winter-session">reported</a>, the Indian government recently revealed it has opted not to introduce a draft bill on a potential cryptocurrency ban to parliament in the coming winter session.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-leaked-draft-bill-would-ban-all-crypto-except-digital-rupee">draft bill</a> — entitled “Banning of Cryptocurrency &amp; Regulation of Official Digital Currencies” — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-leaked-draft-bill-would-ban-all-crypto-except-digital-rupee">reportedly</a> intends not only to impose a complete ban on the use of crypto in India but also to pave the way for a “Digital Rupee” issued by the Reserve Bank of India.</p>
      <p>In late October, Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-adds-nigerian-naira-fiat-trading-pair-opens-deposits">launched</a> support for deposits in Nigerian Naira (NGN), <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-is-launching-fiat-trading-starting-with-russian-ruble">announcing</a> that they would add support for fiat trading earlier that month, starting with the Russian ruble. </p>
      <p>In mid-October, it <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-launches-p2p-trading-for-chinese-yuan">launched</a> p2p trading for Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>), Ether (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-price-index">ETH</a>) and USDT against the Chinese yuan and this month <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-adds-support-for-turkish-lira-and-bitcoin-xrp-ether-trading-pairs">added support</a> for the Turkish lira on its flagship exchange.</p>
      <p>To date, Binance has also launched four international crypto-fiat exchanges, including <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/exclusive-binance-set-to-launch-its-first-crypto-fiat-exchange-in-uganda">Binance Uganda</a>, European trading platform <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-binance-enters-european-markets-launches-binance-jersey">Binance Jersey</a>, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-singapore-launches-but-offers-just-one-trading-pair-report">Binance Singapore</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binanceus-opens-registration-today-excluding-13-states">Binance US</a>.</p>
