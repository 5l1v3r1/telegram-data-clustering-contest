      <p>The PlayStation 4 (PS4) is near the end of its life cycle, now that its successor is officially scheduled to be announced <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2019/195967/sony-playstation-5-official-date-holiday-2020/">next year</a>. But that’s not stopping Sony Interactive Entertainment from releasing a new PS4 Mega Pack. The company is also updating its <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/2018/172997/new-playstation-4-hits-and-party-bundle-available-this-month/">Party Bundle</a> for the year.</p>
      <p>The Mega Pack bundles the PS4 with three of the best games on the platform. They are Grand Theft Auto V Premium Edition, God of War, and Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition. All three games come in their physical disks. It also comes a PS4 Fortnite Neo Versa Bundle voucher, as well as a PS Plus 3-month membership subscription.</p>
      <p>As for the Party Bundle, the two titles that come with it this year are Fifa 20 and Crash team Racing Nitro-Fueled. There are actually two variants of the bundle, both featuring the same games as well as two DualShock 4 controllers. One comes with a PS4 Pro, while another has the standard PS4 bundled.</p>

      <p>The PS4 Mega Pack comes with a RM1349 price tag. As for the Party Bundles, they are priced at RM1499 and RM1899 for the PS4 and PS4 Pro versions, respectively.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, if you decide to get a 12-month PS Plus membership subscription card, you shoul do so between 22 November and 2 December. If you get one from <a href="https://asia.playstation.com/en-my/support/retail-store/">selected stores</a> and redeem them within said window, you’ll get two extra months for your subscription at no extra cost.</p>
