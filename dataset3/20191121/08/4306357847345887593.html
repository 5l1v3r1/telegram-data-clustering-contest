      <h3>Jamie Carragher has urged Liverpool FC manager Jurgen Klopp to focus on their Premier League fixtures rather than the cup competitions during the festive schedule.</h3>
      <p>The Reds are sitting eight points clear of Leicester City and Chelsea FC at the top of the Premier League table following a 3-1 win against Manchester City last time out.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC have a nine-point cushion over the defending champions as the Merseyside outfit prepare for fixture congestion in November, December and January.</p>
      <p>Klopp’s men will play 13 games in 40 days as Liverpool FC participate in the Premier League, the Champions League, the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC start their hectic schedule with a trip to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Former Reds defender Carragher says Liverpool FC need to focus on their Premier League fixture to ensure their title bid stays on track.</p>
      <p>“I know a lot of Liverpool supporters wouldn’t say this, and certainly the club couldn’t, but nothing can get in the way of Liverpool winning the league. Nothing,” Carragher told the <i>Liverpool Echo</i>, as quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jamie-carragher-sends-premier-league-warning-liverpool-boss-jurgen-klopp-11183633/">Metro</a>.</p>
      <p>“The Aston Villa game in the Carabao Cup? If Liverpool get through they will have two semi-finals to play then and that cannot get in the way of Liverpool winning the league.</p>
      <p>“What I mean by that is do not play anyone in your first XI in that Carabao Cup team. Not one. ‘If Liverpool win the league this year and find themselves in the same position next year I wouldn’t be saying that.</p>
      <p>“I’d probably be saying ‘we are Liverpool Football Club. We should try and win the lot.’ But because it has been so long nothing can be allowed to get in the way of Liverpool pushing on and winning the league.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will take on Crystal Palace this weekend before Napoli travel to Merseyside in the Champions League on 27 November.</p>
      <p>The Reds will host Brighton and Everton to Anfield in successive games before a trip to Bournemouth on 7 December.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC finish their Champions League group-stage campaign against Salzburg in Austria on 10 December before a League Cup quarter-final against Aston Villa at Villa Park on 17 December.</p>
      <p>A day later, Liverpool FC will compete in the Fifa World Club Cup semi-final before a potential final on 21 December.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC’s crazy fixture schedule will finish with a trip to Leicester City on Boxing Day before games against Wolves and Sheffield United on 29 December and 1 January respectively.</p>
