      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:42:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:42</time> by <a rel="author">Lily Waddell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lily-waddell/</a></address>
      <p>Emily Atack has stolen Holly Willoughby's jungle style.</p>
      <p>After being blown away by the presenter's style last year, it's no wonder the actress enlisted the same stylist for herself this year.</p>
      <p>The Inbetweeners star, 29, hired Australian-based Angie Smith who was the fashionably trained eye behind Holly's jungle looks last year.</p>
      <p>Extra Camp's Emily showed the similarities didn't bother her while she worked all her best angles for her snaps to document each of her different looks on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> .</p>
      <p>Just days into the show, the presenter has already dressed in a similar plaid button-down minidress for the day.</p>

      <p>Holly had nailed a plaid look last year in a button-down minidress but she pulled off the flirty number in black and red.</p>
      <p>Emily also accessorised her look with Doc Marten-style boots like Holly did as she wanted to achieve the same chic vibe.</p>
      <p>So it appears fans will expect to see some zebra print and floral dresses in the weeks to come.</p>

      <p>Last year, Holly jetted off to the I'm A Celeb jungle for three weeks to present alongside Dec Donnelly.</p>
      <p>The blonde bombshell had been filling in for Ant McPartlin who stepped down from his TV duties following his drink-drive arrest.</p>
      <p>Holly had cemented her style status on This Morning so it's no surprise there was a lot of attention on what clothes she was wearing.</p>

      <p>I'm A Celebrity fans worry as 'accident prone' Dec Donnelly sports second injury</p>
      <p>Last year's jungle princess Emily wanted to ensure she was the queen of style when she assigned the help of Holly's former jungle stylist.</p>
      <p>The former I'm A Celeb star has made her own name in the fashion spheres with her own In The Style collection.</p>
      <p>In March, the comedian confessed she was blown away by Holly's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here wardrobe last year.</p>
      <p>The stand up act admitted the style icon never puts a fashionable foot wrong as she gushed about how much she loved her jungle looks.</p>
      <p>She told <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/news/2019030670563/emily-atack-fashion-range-in-the-style-dress-interview/">Hello! magazine</a> : "[Holly] is amazing - she can't do any wrong. I LOVED her outfits in the jungle. It's hilarious really; when we are in there - you know, we didn't really look our best - we had these mad jungle clothes on.</p>
      <p>"So when Holly comes in with her beautiful outfits, it was so refreshing on the eyes! Every time she and Dec came in, we were like 'Woah!' They smelled amazing too."</p>
