        <b>Finally, it has happened! Colors’ most controversial show Bigg Boss 13 has made it in the Top 10 list. Indeed, the painstaking efforts of the inmates and the makers have bore fruit. Also, we have another reality show Dance Plus 5 entering the list. Other interesting details are provided inside</b>
      </p>
      <p>First things first, the most controversial reality show Bigg Boss 13 which was left out of the coveted Top 10 list of TV shows so far has finally made it. The increasing number of fights in the house or the entry of so many wild cards, some of the key factors that could have contributed in giving the show the much-needed push.</p>
      <p>Also, one can’t forget the <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/bigg-boss-13-evict-sidharth-shukla-trends-called-psycho-akanksha-puri-does-a-turnaround-on-him-exclusive/5dd4fbee87fb571eff7e426a">BIG FIGHT that took place between besties Sidharth Shukla and Asim Riaz</a>. Things are surely heating up inside the house, and what better day than World Television Day to mark a smashing entry in the list at No 9. Another new entrant is the dance reality show Dance Plus 5 that’s judged by Dharmesh Yelande, Karishma Chavan, Punit Pathak and Suresh Mukund. Remo Dsouza is the super judge of the show. This is placed on the 7th spot.</p>

      <p>While we brought you the BIG SURPRISES, it’s time to see which show ranks at the top spot. No prizes for guessing, it’s Kundali Bhagya yet again while Kumkum Bhagya sits on No 2. Another show that’s picking up steadily on the TRP chart is Yeh Jaadu Hai Jinn Ka. Clearly, the makers’ Jaadu is working wonders for the series as it jumps up from No 6 to 3 this time.</p>
      <p>Next, we have Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah. We remember how Dayaben’s entry ki khabar had brought the show on top of the charts, but now it’s placed on No 4. Not bad! <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/television/television-news/shivangi-joshi-mohsin-khan-are-no-more-a-couple-yeh-rishta-kya-kehlata-hai-actors-are-faking-it-for-the-show-exclusive/5dc94a6487fb571eff7e3af8">Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai’s lead pair Shivangi Joshi and Mohsin Khan may not be together in real life any longer</a>, but their on-screen chemistry is just about enough to keep the show steady on the list. This time, it’s placed on No 5.</p>

      <p>Choti Sardarni comes next on the 6th position and like we said before, No 7 is occupied by the new entry Dance Plus 5. Big B’s quiz show has managed to stay in the list consistently and it comes on number 8 this time.</p>
      <p>You very well know by now who’s on number 9. Salman Khan who’s the host and dost of the show must be finally heaving a sigh of relief and we think from hereon, there should be no stopping for Bigg Boss 13.</p>
