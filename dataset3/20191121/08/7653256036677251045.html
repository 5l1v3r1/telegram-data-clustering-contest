      <h1>Gold rally pauses for trade talks outcome; be on your guard</h1>
      <h2>It is small investors who haven’t lost their appetite for gold and who are still long.</h2>

      <p>Sentiment in gold market was bullish in August, but the bears are now trying to make a comeback. The market mood has turned sour as US-China <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/trade-talks">trade talks</a> progressed.</p>
      <p>Many institutional and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/hedge-funds">hedge funds</a>, which in the last six months were bullish on gold, have started to turn bearish and turned their attention to riskier assets. But many individual investors and banks still remain stubbornly bullish on gold.</p>
      <p>It is small investors who haven’t lost their appetite for gold and who are still long. The speculative long positions accumulated during July-August rally have not been discharged yet and it remains an overhang. This will serve as a handicap to gold if bulls decide to liquidate long position in the coming days. The excess long positions will keep a lid on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/gold-prices">gold prices</a> until these excess long positions are liquidated.</p>

      <p>The above graph shows Commitment of Traders report (COT) by way of green line (Large Speculators), blue line (Small Speculators) and Red line (Commercials). Large speculators are still net long in the metals. As seen from the last three years, gold faces headwinds when such large net speculators positions are long and gold usually tops out around that zone. Contrasts to large speculators, commercials are less inclined to load gold up. This can be interpreted as commercials are bearish on gold.</p>
      <p>Again, whenever large speculators and commercials have come near zero positions or whenever they have reduced their net long and net short positions, gold has rallied. It’s not just commercials, but many <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/institutional-investors">institutional investors</a> such as Morgan Stanley have gradually turned bearish on gold. They have said they expect gold prices to fall toward the $1,394 level in the first half of 2020 if the US and China roll back their trade tariffs as expected.</p>
      <p>JP Morgan which had ‘overweight’ recommendation has now changed to ‘small underweight’ recommendation. The current ETF reports also suggest that ETF investors have reduced their gold holdings.</p>

      <p>I reiterate the view that gold prices are far from 200-day moving average and need to converge. So even though gold is consolidating and nowhere in an overbought zone according to oscillators such as RSI, 200-DMA suggests that gold rally is overextended.</p>
      <p>Whenever such a scenario comes, it sends the message to technically oriented traders that market is potentially overbought or oversold and vulnerable to bear or bull raid.</p>
      <p>It is for this reason that market participants take profits or sell outright whenever the distance between price and the underlying moving average becomes conspicuous.</p>
      <p>In the current scenario, we expect gold to trade sideways as it will wait for outcome on the US-China trade war front. Gold rally on the upside will be limited for now.</p>
