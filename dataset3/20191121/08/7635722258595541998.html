        <b>A man in his 30s has died following a crash in Co Tipperary in the early hours of this morning.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It happened at around 3am on the N24 at Killaloan on the outskirts of Clonmel.</p>
      <p>The driver of the car was taken to South Tipperary General Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Two passengers - a man and a woman, both in their 20s - were also taken to hospital with injuries that are not thought to be life threatening.</p>
      <p>The road remains closed this morning, with local diversions in place.</p>
      <p>A forensic exam is due to take place at the scene.</p>
      <p>Clonmel Garda Station Superintendent William Leahy said: "From our initial enquiries it’s understood the car, a 05WH registered silver Volkswagen Polo, left the road and struck a wall while travelling from Clonmel in the direction of Carrick-on-Suir.</p>
      <p>"We are appealing for witnesses and in particular anyone who travelling on this stretch of road between 2.45am and 3.15am this morning to contact us at Clonmel Garda Station. We would also ask any road user with camera footage to make it available to investigating gardaí."</p>
