      <h2>Sabri Lamouchi's Reds return to Championship action on Saturday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T08:37:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 08:37</time> by <a rel="author">James Pallatt</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> have received a double injury boost ahead of their return to action in the Championship.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi</a>'s Reds tackle Bristol City on Saturday, and victory at Ashton Gate could lift them into second place in the table.</p>
      <p>After being given some time off during the international break, the players are back on the training ground preparing for the Robins - and the club have posted a picture of Carl Jenkinson and Alfa Semedo taking part alongside their teammates.</p>

      <p>Jenkinson has not played for the Reds since the end of August, following his arrival from Arsenal, because of an ankle injury, while Semedo has been sidelined with a back injury for the last two months.</p>
      <p>"Good to see you back, lads!" Forest wrote on Twitter.</p>
