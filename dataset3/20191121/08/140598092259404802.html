      <h1>How to choose a Christmas tree: A complete guide to real vs artificial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-22T08:55:00+00:00">22 Nov 2019, 08:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/richard-jones/" target="_blank">Richard Jones</a></address>
      <p>Did you know that <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/luther_martin.shtml">Martin Luther</a> is said to have invented the modern Christmas tree? Legend has it that the scourge of medieval Catholicism had the idea while walking through a forest at night, where the starry night sky was glistening through the trees. Inspired, Luther chopped down a tree, took it home, and decorated it with candles to recreate the effect.</p>
      <p>Fast forward 500 years and the Christmas tree is a near-universal feature in our homes during December (although health and safety has put paid to those fire hazard candles). And that means there’s half a millennium of intimidating Christmas tree expertise that you have to crack at this time of year.</p>
      <p>Below, we’ve laid out everything you need to know to buy the perfect Christmas tree in 2019.</p>
      <h3>Where did the tradition originate?</h3>
      <p>Luther may (or may not) have come up with the idea, but it took until the 17th century for the Christmas tree to spread beyond southern Germany. Early decorations hung from prickly pine branches included multi-coloured paper roses, gold foil and fresh apples.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/albert_prince.shtml">Prince Albert</a> is widely credited as having introduced the Christmas tree to Britain in 1840, but the first known Christmas tree was actually set up in 1800, by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/race-monarchy">Queen Charlotte</a>, the German wife of George III at Queen’s Lodge, Windsor. It grew in popularity among the aristocracy until Albert drew mass attention to the tradition by importing several spruce firs from his native Coburg.</p>
      <p>By 1860, it was considered social suicide among the upper classes not to have one during the festive season.</p>
      <h3>Real or artificial - are Christmas trees sustainable?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li><b>Do </b>consider potential allergens</li>
        <li><b>Don’t </b>assume artificial is the eco option</li>
        <li><b>Don’t</b> underestimate that magical Christmas tree smell</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s a question that would have made dear Luther spit out his Christmas pudding – but before you <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/decorate-christmas-tree/">decorate a tree</a>, you need to decide whether to go <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/how-to-grow/what-is-the-best-real-christmas-tree/">real</a> or <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/15-best-artificial-christmas-trees-uk-buy/">artificial</a>.</p>
      <p>A common misconception is that artificial trees are better for the environment. <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/home/">The Carbon Trust</a> estimates that a two-metre-tall artificial tree has twice the carbon footprint of a real tree that ends up in a landfill. If that real tree is burned, then the artificial tree’s footprint is ten times as large. Consequently, your <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-artificial-christmas-trees-and-where-to-buy-them/">artificial tree</a> would need to last at least ten Christmases for it to be considered better for the environment.</p>
      <p>Aside from the environmental issue, what other reasons are there for going artificial? “Some people really don’t like the needles on real trees, or we would recommend an artificial tree if the client had an allergy,” says <a href="https://www.cardinalevents.co.uk/">Helene Webb</a> of Cardinal Christmas Decorating, a bespoke luxury Christmas decorating service.</p>
      <p>According to a survey by <a href="https://haymax.biz/">Haymax</a>, one third of the UK population suffers from an increase in itchy skin and cold-like symptoms after putting up their Christmas tree. An allergy to the real trees, known as ‘<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/christmas/8963438/Feeling-under-the-weather-Youve-got-Christmas-Tree-Syndrome.html">Christmas Tree Syndrome</a>’, is a result of mould that builds up on the branches and trunk. If your symptoms become noticeably worse in and around the room the Christmas tree is kept in, then artificial is the way to go.</p>
      <p>As for going with a real tree, the arguments are all about authenticity. “One of the nice things about a real Christmas tree is when you do come down every morning, it will be in a different shape from when you went to bed,” says Harry Brightwell, secretary of the <a href="https://www.bctga.co.uk/">British Christmas Tree Growers Association </a>(BCTGA). “They are living, so they change as they’re getting older – just like the rest of us.”</p>
      <p>Webb mentions the loss of that Christmas tree fragrance with artificial trees, and while retailers now sell Christmas tree fragrance sticks to try and recreate the smell, they are far from the real deal. “I always say to people who only have an artificial tree that they’re missing out,” says Brightwell. “No one is going to remember climbing into the loft and pulling down the same tree as last year.</p>
      <p>“Buying your Christmas tree is about creating that special event to signal the start of Christmas.”</p>

      <h3>When to buy your real Christmas tree - and how to choose</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Do buy early.</b> All Christmas trees are felled at the same time, so there is no point in delaying.</li>
        <li><b>Do think twice before buying from a pop-up tree seller.</b> They’ll disappear as fast as they appear, so you won’t be able to return dodgy goods.</li>
        <li><b>Do measure the room height</b> <b>before you go out – and don’t forget the extra room the stand takes.</b> Your tree has to fit!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The major garden centre chains started to sell Christmas trees in late November and, although many will consider this too early to buy a tree, the truth is that it’s a case of the earlier the better.</p>
      <p>“There’s no benefit at all from waiting into December,” warns David Mitchell, <a href="https://www.wyevalegardencentres.co.uk/">Wyevale Garden Centre’s</a> Christmas tree expert. According to Mitchell this is because all the trees get cut at the same time, in early-November; their distribution is then drip-fed over the following weeks. It is therefore better to get there early and start caring for and feeding your tree, rather than letting it sit on a pile with all the others, yearning for the water it needs to stay healthy.</p>
      <p>On the <a href="https://www.bctga.co.uk/">BCTGA </a>website, you can put in your postcode and find your local Christmas tree farm, along with the types that they stock. Pop-up Christmas tree sellers will also be out in force during the coming weeks, but it is generally wise to go with a BCTGA member who will be available to help you out should you encounter any future problems with your tree. </p>
      <p>You should be looking for a British-grown tree as its carbon footprint will be substantially less than one that has been transported from mainland Europe. Importantly, it will also be fresher.</p>
      <p>Room height is very important. “A lot of people can get carried away and get something too big for the space and forget that the stand adds an extra 20cm at the bottom,” says Mitchell. “It’s quite an easy mistake to make and you might find that you have to cut the top off, which then gives you a conundrum in terms of where are you going to put the fairy.”</p>
      <p>Generally speaking, people look for one of two shapes: tall or wide. The wide, bushy types are more popular in continental Europe, especially in Germany, the Christmas tree’s home. Here in the UK, we are more into tall and slim, possibly due to the fact the average home size is four metres squared smaller.</p>
      <p>The slimmer profile also lets more light shine through the tree branches. And, with Christmas baubles getting ever heavier, they can hold decoration all the way up to the top branches.</p>
      <h3>The options:</h3>
      <h4>Nordmann fir</h4>

      <p>The BCTGA estimates that 80 percent of the real trees sold in the UK are Nordmann firs. It is sometimes called the non-drop as it doesn’t shed its needles as often as other varieties.</p>
      <p>The Nordmann has lots of defined layers while the needles have a thick, waxy coating (useful if you suffer from allergies). Its soft foliage means it should be lustrous to the touch and won’t have you screaming for the first aid box like other options.</p>
      <h4>Norway spruce</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>The second-most-popular option is the Norway spruce, which comprises roughly 15 percent of all real trees sold at Christmas. This is the Christmas tree that will tap into your nostalgia – it used to be the most popular and widely available. However, the needles on a spruce shed more than the Nordmann and are very fine and spiky, making it less practical for families with pets or children who like to explore with their hands. Ouch!</p>
      <h4>Best of the rest</h4>
      <p><b>The Fraser fir</b> is a good option if you are struggling for space, owing to its tall and slim profile. It is darker green than the Norway and the Nordmann, and has a distinct citrus fragrance. <b>The Noble Fir</b> is the bushiest of the options and has greyish-blue needles. <b>The Scots pine</b> is the only Christmas tree native to the British Isles and the most common Christmas tree option in the US, because it is a relatively easy option to grow and maintain. </p>
      <p>Last year, prices on Christmas trees were between £45 to £55 for most 6-7ft Nordman trees grown by official BCTGA members, while Norway spruces were around £25 to £35. Expect to pay the same this Christmas.</p>
      <h3>What to do when at the store</h3>

        <figcaption>Every tree is unique, so get among them to assess whether they’re right Credit: Hero Images/Hero Images</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Don’t buy a tree that is in netting. </b>It can damage the branches, and hide a multitude of sins.</li>
        <li><b>Do run your fingers along the needles. </b>Make sure they don’t all fall off immediately.</li>
        <li><b>Do lift the tree and gently tap it on the floor</b> as a second test. </li>
        <li><b>Don’t buy a tree with pale and tired needles. </b>It’s already on its way out.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Right, you’ve decided on your variety, and where you’re going to pop it. Now comes Christmas tree judgement day.</p>
      <p>The BCTGA estimates that seven million real trees are sold in the UK each year, so there’s plenty of choice. Every tree is unique, so you really have to get in and among them to assess whether they’re right for your needs.</p>
      <p>Because of this, you will want to see the Christmas trees out of the netting. Alarm bells should be jingling if the seller is keeping all their trees in netting.  </p>
      <p>“It would beg the question, are they trying to hide something if they haven’t un-netted the trees,” ponders Mitchell. “It’s also better for the trees to be un-netted so that they can relax. The branches can settle rather than being kept firmly upright throughout the harvest, as you might find that when you take the net off they stay in that position.”</p>
      <p>The Christmas tree outing is like being a singleton hunting for love at the work Christmas party. You want to put that tree through its paces and make sure that this is a relationship that’s going to last more than a few weeks</p>
      <p>Here’s the BCTGA’s whistlestop routine when looking for Christmas (tree) love:</p>
      <p>“Hold the tree in your hands loosely and then run your fingers along the branches to make sure the needles are attached to the tree. We also suggest lifting it a foot off the ground and gently tapping it a couple of times on the floor just to make sure it is healthy and the needles are staying on. You’ll probably find a few brown needles on the inside of the tree drop to the floor, but you wouldn’t expect to see a lot of the green needles do that.”</p>
      <p>The needles should be a dark green, rather than pale and worn out. Look for symmetry. The tree should feel lustrous to the touch and not dried up.</p>
      <p>Treat it mean to keep it keen, but don’t forget to show it a good time. Give the tree a little spin so that you can see movement in the branches and needles. Imagine that tree sitting in your house, and getting through the awkward festive meet and greet with the parents. Is this the one for you?</p>
      <h3>How to look after your Christmas tree </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Do take the tree out of the netting. </b>Asap!</li>
        <li><b>Do saw off the bottom of the tree. </b>Then slice off the bark on the base for optimum water retention.</li>
        <li><b>Don’t bring the tree indoors straight away. </b>If you’ve bought it early, that is.</li>
        <li><b>Don’t forget to keep the tree well watered. </b>It’s thirsty...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first thing to do when you get your tree home is to cut the netting open. Let it move and breathe.</p>
      <p>If you’ve bought early, the tree doesn’t necessarily need to come straight into the house. Set up a bucket of water in your garden patio for the tree to stay in until you wish to invite it into your home – preferably in a shaded area.</p>
      <p>Regardless of when you buy the tree, the next step is vital.</p>
      <p>Saw off a few centimetres from the bottom and then shave and peel off around a centimetre of bark from the new base of the tree. “It’s all about water uptake at the start with your Christmas tree, and the water actually goes up the bark rather than through the wood of the tree, which is a popular misconception,” says Mitchell.</p>
      <p>Whether you’re keeping it in the bucket or putting it in a stand, you’ll also want to get it fed from day one. When your tree is cut, it will try to seal itself off to prevent infection – the feed keeps the pores of the tree open, so that it drinks all the way to Christmas. Feed your tree on the first day and then again on the fifth.</p>
      <p>Your <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/0/best-christmas-tree-stands-2019/">Christmas tree stand</a> should have a little vessel so that you can keep it watered. It can drink up to two pints of water a day. If it is continuously gorging itself on your water supply, consider turning the heating down. If you kept it in a bucket of water outside before bringing it in the house then you will not see this level of fast drinking, according to Mitchell.</p>
      <p>Don’t worry about sunlight – a cut tree doesn’t need that to keep it green.</p>
      <h3>What do you do with your Christmas tree at the end of the holidays?</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Traditionally <b>the 12th night after Christmas day</b> (January 6) is the time to get rid of all your decorations, including your tree.</li>
        <li>You can <b>burn your Christmas tree. </b>As we saw earlier, this cuts down its environmental cost substantially. </li>
        <li>However, <b>DO NOT</b> burn in it in your fireplace as the sap can turn into creosote, a tar that can easily catch fire inside your chimney. </li>
        <li>Many local councils offer a <b>waste disposal service</b>, and some even offer a collection service too.</li>
        <li>Alternatively, <b>chop the tree into pieces and put it in your green bin.</b> Go to the <a href="https://www.recyclenow.com/">Recycle Now</a> website to see how and where to recycle Christmas trees in your local area.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>The pot-grown Christmas tree</h3>
      <p>What if we told you that there was a way to celebrate Christmas forever – or as long as a tree can feasibly live for?</p>
      <p>If you invest in a potted tree that has been dug up with some of the roots and then placed in a soiled pot, then you’ve basically got your tree sorted for next year without having to barter with any tree dealers anymore. Just take it out of the pot, and replant it in your garden for next year.</p>
      <p>However, there is one problem with the potted Christmas tree. Left unchecked, they can easily grow to four to five metres in height, which can cause difficulties when trying to land a sleigh in a back garden on Christmas Eve.</p>
