      <p>The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condoled with the family of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) woman leader in Kogi State, Salome Abuh, who was killed during the state governorship election.</p>
      <p>Concise News reports that the spokesman of PDP Wada/Aro campaign council, Faruk Adejoh-Audu, had <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/20/pdp-demands-justice-for-slain-women-leader-in-kogi/">alleged that suspected APC thugs arrived at Abuh’s house</a> at about 2:00pm on Monday and were shooting sporadically.</p>
      <p>According to Adejoh-Audu, the thugs surrounded the house and blocked every exit from outside.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Woman Leader of Wada Aro Campaign Council, Ochadamu Ward, Hon Mrs Acheju Abuh was this afternoon burnt alive in her home by jubilant Bello supporters and thugs said to be celebrating his victory.</p>
      <p>“They then poured petrol on the building and set it ablaze as other terrorized villagers watched from hiding.”</p>
      <p>He said Abuh reportedly attempted to escape through a window but was prevented by the metal burglar proof and gunshots fired in her direction.</p>
      <p>Adejoh-Audu said the thugs waited and watched Abuh crying from inside the inferno until her voice died out, then left when the house and the victim were totally burnt.</p>
      <p>He said there is no indication that the Kogi state police “will arrest her killers or even prevent further attacks and killings of our people”.</p>
      <p>The PDP spokesman, however, called on the Inspector-General of Police to protect the people of the state.</p>
      <p>However, in a statement on Wednesday issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, in Abuja, the APC condemned the post-election violence reported in the state and urged the Kogi people not to allow the violence to escalate.</p>
      <p>“We are aware that Gov. Yahaya Bello has already directed law enforcement agencies to fish out the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>“The APC abhors violence and other criminalities which, sadly, have continued to plague our electioneering process.</p>
      <p>“We, however, urge people to see the election as a democratic contest and not a do-or-die and for which we should pay with our lives.</p>
      <p>“We pray that the police arrest the culprits and the full weight of the law brought to bear on them.</p>
      <p>“Also, President Muhammadu Buhari has urged those who are not happy with the results of the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa to seek redress in court and shun violence.</p>
      <p>“We must all heed this call,” Issa-Onilu said.</p>
