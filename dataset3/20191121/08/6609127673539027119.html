      <p>Posing in a pink dress to reveal her growing baby bump, Josie showed her dark black hair, fake brows and lashes.</p>
      <p>She is expecting a little girl on Valentine's Day next year to join her big family.</p>
      <p>Over the past six years, Josie has changed her entire image since being known as "the most hated woman in Britain".</p>
      <p>She bragged about getting a £5,000 boob job for free on the NHS.</p>

      <p>Shockingly, Josie then admitted she would abort her third child so she could enter Big Brother.</p>
      <p>At the time she told The Mirror: “I’m finally on the verge of becoming famous and I’m not going to ruin it now.</p>
      <p>“An abortion will further my career. This time next year I won’t have a baby. Instead, I’ll be famous, driving a bright pink Range Rover and buying a big house. Nothing will get in my way.”</p>

      <p>The fame-hungry mum was so desperate to famous she considered not going through with the pregnancy, but backed out when the unborn child kicked en route to the abortion.</p>
      <p>She then tried to sell tickets to her labour before welcoming her first little girl.</p>
      <p>When she got pregnant again in 2015, Josie went through with the abortion when a doctor told her she couldn't get a nose job while pregnant.</p>

      <p>Josie told the Sunday People: “I’m having this nose job no matter what gets in my way. Pregnancy was a major obstacle and an abortion was the answer to it – so that’s what I did.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who criticises me for putting my looks ahead of an unborn child has no right until they’re the ones putting food on the table for my kids. I don’t care what anyone thinks. My body, my decision."</p>
      <p>She was later turned down for the nose job she had the abortion for after doctors deemed her nose too badly damaged to be operated on.</p>
      <p>Josie had her fourth child (and second daughter) in October 2016.</p>
