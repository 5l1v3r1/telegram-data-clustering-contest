      <p>Gold Coast have completed their trio of re-signings from the top end of last year's draft with Jack Lukosius committing to the club until the end of 2022.</p>
      <p>South Australian forward Lukosius, the No. 2 draft pick last year, follows Izak Rankine (No. 3) and Ben King (No. 6) in re-signing with the Suns.</p>
      <p>It is a major coup for the battling club, who are poised to land Victorians Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson with picks No. 1 and 2 of the upcoming national draft.</p>

      <p>"Over the off-season I took the opportunity to reflect on my first year at AFL level and that made making the decision an easy one, I’ve loved my time at the club so far,” Lukosius said.</p>
      <p>"We’ve got a great group of players, who are all committing to the future of this football club and I can’t wait to be a part of it.</p>
      <p>"The way everyone at the club has made my family and I feel welcome has definitely helped with the transition to becoming a professional footballer in the AFL.</p>
      <p>"The challenge now is to put my head down, continue to work hard on developing my game and ensure I’m ready to play my role for the team on field in 2020."</p>
