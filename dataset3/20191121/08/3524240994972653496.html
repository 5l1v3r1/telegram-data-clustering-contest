        <b>Chukwudi Akasike, Port Harcourt</b>
      </p>
      <p>THE Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People on Wednesday gave conditions for the resumption of oil exploration in Ogoniland.</p>
      <p>The conditions are contained in a document titled ‘Memorandum on benchmarks for engagement between Ogoni Community and Companies desiring to take over the operatorship of Ogoni Fields in OML 11’.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the Draft Committee on the Memorandum, Prof Ben Naanen, said any oil firm desiring to do business in Ogoniland must take seriously the need to reduce poverty through sustainable oil and gas investment in the area.</p>
      <p>Naanen, a former MOSOP President, who presented the draft to some of the stakeholders in Port Harcourt, added that apart from gas-powered electrification of Ogoni, such  companies were expected to work towards the reduction of poverty-related security threats in the communities.</p>
      <p>The chairman said the  deliverables in the memorandum were that “8,000 direct and indirect jobs are created to stimulate production, consumption and economic growth in the area.</p>
      <p>“Oil and gas facilities and operations boost local, state and federal revenues. Improvement in health, education and social infrastructure through effective benefits-sharing and CSR programmes by oil and gas companies.</p>
      <p>“Improvement in the security situation in Ogoni deriving from the opportunities that have  been created, especially for the youths. The vehicle for the delivery of these objectives and deliverables is an innovative model of benefit-sharing agreement with the government and oil companies.”</p>
      <p>Naanen  said  the committee, which would be known as Ogoni Oil and Gas Committee, was created the document (draft memorandum) to address how the ordinary Ogoni man could benefit directly from the oil resources in Ogoni and not as determined by the elite.</p>
      <p>He noted that the 13 per cent derivation for the development of  Niger Delta had not been well managed and called on lawmakers in the region to create a system that would ensure that those managing the derivation were made to account for it.</p>
      <p>MOSOP President, Legborsi Pyagbara,  said  many had died during the struggle to achieve the best practices in oil exploration in Ogoni and other oil producing communities.</p>
      <p>Pyagbara said, “At least 2,000 souls were lost and the hallmark was the eventual departure of Shell some years ago. It (oil exploration) is no longer an issue between the government and the oil company, but an issue that has been joined by the community.”</p>
