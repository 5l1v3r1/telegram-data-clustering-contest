        <b>A MOVE for Rangers star Alfredo Morelos is now unlikely for Saint Etienne in January, according to reports.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Gers</a> ace has been on incredible form for club and country this campaign, bagging 23 goals in all competitions.</p>

      <p>The Colombian's red-hot strike rate has attracted attention from clubs around Europe, and yesterday it was said that French outfit Saint Etienne were the latest to be keen.</p>
      <p>However, according to <a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/exclu-mercato-asse-le-point-sur-le-dossier-morelos-rangers-481729?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Le10sport</a>, the Ibrox club have been labelled as 'being greedy' over their main man.</p>
      <p>The media outlet in France say that a summer move is far more viable as they cooled talk of an advance for the hitman in the winter window.</p>
      <p>It is believed that the Ligue One club have scouted the striker on a number of occasions, most recently against Porto where Steven Gerrard's men won 2-1 at Ibrox.</p>

      <p>Morelos has bagged 11 goals in the Europa League for the Light Blues this term against the likes of the Portuguese giants, Young Boys and Legia Warsaw.</p>
      <p>And its those performances on the continental stage which are earning him rave reviews as the attention grows in the 23-year-old.</p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> exclusively told you that <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10186085/crystal-palace-transfer-alfredo-morelos/">EPL side Crystal Palace are preparing a £20million January bid</a>.</p>
      <p>However, other clubs such as Aston Villa and Bordeaux have been credited with interest too.</p>
      <p>Both Rangers gaffer Steven Gerrard and director of football <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4949527/ross-wilson-rangers-alfredo-morelos/">Ross Wilson are adamant that the Ibrox club do not need to sell their prized assets in January</a>.</p>
      <p>Wilson's "categorical" statement came after the club's financial figures uncovered that they'd made an annual loss of £11.3million.</p>
