                      <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Juventus for Manchester United at the end of this season</h3>
                      <p>Spanish television pundit Eduardo Inda, speaking on ‘Chiringuito De Jugones’ said:</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>“Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Juventus at the end of the current season if they do not win the Champions League.</i>

                          <p>
                            <i>“He went to Turin to try and win the Champions League with a third different club but things are getting complicated.”</i>
                          </p>

                            <p>
                              <i>“Juventus want to sign Pogba and Mbappe. I think it is going to be difficult for them, especially the second one.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“Due to the salary limits, if they want to sign these players, they would have to allow for Ronaldo’s exit from the club. So it is becoming a very likely outcome.” </i>
                            </p>
                            <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10383593/ronaldo-man-utd-transfer-juventus/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballfacebook201119&amp;utm_source=Facebook#Echobox=1574247779">The Sun</a> have reported that if Ronaldo leaves Juventus, Manchester United will be his likely destination. Although, it looks a very hard claim to believe. Unless Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side qualify for the Champions League this season, the probability of an Old Trafford comeback is extremely low.</p>
                            <p>There is also the matter of United’s transfer policy seeing them turn their attention to youth. At 34, Ronaldo hardly seems like the kind of candidate they are looking for. However, United faithfuls will be hoping with bated breath for the club to go all out on him should he become available.</p>
