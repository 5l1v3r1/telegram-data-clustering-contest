      <p>GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. – All 46 schools in a Grand Junction-area school district will be shut down on Thursday and Friday as an <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/every-school-in-western-colorado-district-now-closing-for-the-week-as-virus-spreads">unknown virus</a> continues to spread among students and district employees.</p>
      <p>The Mesa County Valley School District 51 will re-open after next week's Thanksgiving break.</p>
      <p>"We are taking this highly unusual action because this virus is extremely contagious and spreading quickly across our schools," district nursing coordinator Tanya Marvin said in a news release. "In addition, it appears that there is now a second, related virus that is affecting students, some of whom have already been ill in recent weeks. The combination of the two has created an unprecedented spread of illness."</p>
      <p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/4-grand-junction-area-schools-closed-more-cleaned-as-illness-spreads">district had announced that four schools</a> — Rocky Mountain Elementary, Juniper Ridge Community School, Palisade High School and Mount Garfield Middle School — closed because of the virus.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of the virus include vomiting spells that develop quickly and can last 12 to 24 hours. County health officials have said they are still working to determine the illness.</p>
      <p>The school district's custodial crews will work to disinfect the schools during the closure.</p>
