      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 ― The Employees Provident Fund (EPF) today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the South Korea's National Pension Service (NPS) to gain access to the best practices in the area of social protection.</p>
      <p>EPF chief executive officer Tunku Alizakri Alias said the partnership would also encourage knowledge-sharing on pension system management.</p>
      <p>“This partnership presents us an opportunity to tap into a reservoir of global experts and seek solutions from different perspective,” he said during the signing ceremony, which was witnessed by Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng.</p>
      <p>Tunku Alizakri signed the MoU on behalf of EPF while NPS was represented by its chairman and chief executive officer Sung Joo Kim.</p>
      <p>EPF is eager to leverage on new skills and initiatives from its regional counterparts in addressing an ageing as well as a largely self-employed population, said Tunku Alizakri.</p>
      <p>“As Malaysia aspires towards developed nation status, we must look towards the best models to uncover new strategies in tackling social well-being issues such as the rise of the gig economy and an ageing population.</p>
      <p>“This collaboration underlines our proactive commitment to addressing issues related to the well-being of our members,” he added.</p>
      <p>Established in 1987, NPS is one of the world's largest pension funds with total assets under management of US$600 billion (RM2.5 trillion) and 21 million compulsory contributors. ― Bernama</p>
