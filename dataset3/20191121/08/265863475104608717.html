      <p>Kim Kardashian West is teasing what fans can expect from the famous family’s annual Christmas.</p>
      <p>The Kardashian and Jenner Christmas card has become a holiday staple over the years. Thanks to the success of <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians,</i> the family catapulted to stardom. Each year the glamorous clan gathers for an iconic card. There is always a theme and it is always elaborate.</p>
      <p>Over the years the family has grown, making getting them all together for a photoshoot, challenging. Some members of the Kardashian and Jenner clan have even decided to forgo the family tradition in recent years.</p>

      <p>In 2016, due to all the drama surrounding the reality TV family, a Christmas card was not done. The next year in 2017, a series of pictures were released as part of the family’s 25 Days of Christmas pictures.</p>
      <p>Family tensions were at an all-time high in 2017. Plus, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner were both pregnant at the time but had not revealed they were expecting publicly.</p>
      <p>Fans of the show will recall, Kendall Jenner ended up being photoshopped into some of the pictures since she could not be at the shoot. Oh, and <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/kourtney-kardashian-makes-a-joke-regarding-her-sister-kylie-jenners-absence-from-the-traditional-family-christmas-pic-100999/">Kylie did not even participat</a>e to keep her pregnancy hidden.</p>
      <p>Last year, the only members featured in the Christmas card were Kylie, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney, along with all their children. A meme featuring Kendall’s floating head quickly took over social media after the card was released.</p>
      <p>So, what can fans expect from the 2019 Kardashian and Jenner Christmas card?</p>
      <p>While talking to <i>E! News</i> about SKIMS Solutionwear, Kim teased this year is going to be different.</p>

      <p>“I think this Christmas card will be just my family, like me Kanye and the kids because it’s a lot to wrangle everybody,” Kim revealed. She also stated she wants something warm and cozy for her family card.</p>
      <p>Kim Kardashian is teasing she is doing her own thing for the Kardashian and Jenner family Christmas card. Could it be the elaborate cards are a thing of the past? Is the family dynamic so bad, not all the famous members can be together to take a picture? There has been a lot of fighting between Kim and Kourtney lately.</p>
      <p>It is important to remember one thing when it comes to the crazy famous family. They are known for doing the unexpected. There is a good chance Kim is merely trying to steer fans in the wrong direction.</p>
      <p>Do you think Kim is really doing her own card or is it a ploy?</p>
