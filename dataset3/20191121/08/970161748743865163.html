      <p>Heading out on Wednesday night <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/simon-cowell/">Simon Cowell</a> looked a million quid as he celebrated the opening of a musical with partner Lauren Silverman as the loved-up pair left their five-year-old son Eric at home to take in the sights and sounds of &amp; Juliet in London.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-x-factor/">X Factor</a> judge Simon donned a smart suit for the evening, wearing not his usual uniform of very-unbuttoned white shirt and trousers in favour a darker hue, just for something a little different.</p>
      <p>‘Tis nighttime, after all.</p>
      <p>Lauren matched her beau by wearing an all-black ensemble consisting of a minidress and strappy heels as she draped a blazer over her shoulders while walking into the venue, as Simon held a cigarette – the one vice he’s not been able to ditch in his newfound healthier lifestyle.</p>

      <p>Ha, oh it’s good to be rich.</p>
      <p>Stopping for photos outside the Shaftesbury Theatre in the capital, the chilly temperatures didn’t freeze the grin from the faces of the pair who looked comfy and cosy before heading inside.</p>

      <p>After emerging looking trim and toned, Simon was recently forced to rubbish claims that his 20lb weight loss was the result of a gastric bypass.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Best magazine, Si-Co said: ‘People have said: “Oh, he’s had a gastric band fitted” – but I haven’t. If I had, I would admit to it. This diet is all about what you put into your body.</p>
      <p>‘I met this doctor in LA and he told me my diet was appalling and I had to cut out fatty foods and certain drinks. I could see the difference. Cutting out sugar made a massive difference. The first few weeks were difficult, but then I actually stopped craving sugar.’</p>
      <p>He revealed: ‘I had also found a brilliant gluten-free beer, which helps. The hardest part is when I see Eric eat pizza in front of me. That’s really tough.’</p>
      <p>The judge and Syco boss previously put his new physique down to the ‘Eric Cowell diet’, claiming he was inspired by his son’s healthy living regime after being rushed to hospital in 2017 as a result of fainting due to low blood pressure.</p>

      <p>Since then he’s continued to make drastic changes to his lifestyle, cutting out all the naughty stuff – except cigarettes, obviously.</p>
      <p>‘I went to see this guy who’s very well-known. And he said to me, after doing some blood work, “You can’t have red meat, dairy, sugar, bread or gluten”,’ he told Extra TV.</p>
      <p>Simon asked whether he could still drink alcohol, adding: ‘And he said, “Maybe not quite as much as you had before”. And I did it and I stuck to it and it’s easy.’</p>
