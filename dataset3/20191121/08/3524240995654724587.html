      <h1>Ruiz: Joshua dropped me with lucky punch</h1>

      <p>Andy Ruiz Jr has claimed it was Anthony Joshua who threw a lucky punch in their first meeting. The chubby heavyweight stunned the boxing world by knocking Joshua down four times before stopping him in the seventh round.</p>
      <p>Ruiz relieved the Brit of his three world titles with Joshua claiming he did so with a “lucky punch sent from the Gods.”</p>
      <p>But as the rivals prepare to clash again next month, the champion has hit back, claiming he wasn’t hurt when he was dropped in the third round.</p>
      <p>“That was a lucky shot for him, too,” Ruiz Jr told Sky Sports. “I got lazy. It was a punch in the blink of an eye. I thought: ‘What just happened?’</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t that hurt because I wasn’t wobbling. I still had the will and the fire inside of me. I wanted to keep fighting and win the fight.</p>
      <p>“Once he dropped me, then got me with a really good right hand, I could eat his punches. Mentally he thought, ‘This guy isn’t going down, what is happening?”</p>
      <p>“I had to do everything possible to change the fight, and that’s what I did with the left hook.</p>
      <p>“The left hook was a really great shot in the temple. The other times I hit him in the head, he loosened up and got wobbly. I was the better fighter that day because I pressured him, threw more punches and the body shots put him down.”</p>
