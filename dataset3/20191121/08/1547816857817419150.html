It is one documentary that left many inspired and willing to give veganism a try, and even Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli lauded it, calling it an eye-opener. Which brings us to the question, what is the hype all about?</p>
      <p>For starters, this Netflix documentary stars several world-famous athletes and bodybuilders who talk about their plant-based diets and their success stories.

It also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Lewis Hamilton and mixed-martial artists James Wilks, and many others. This documentary smashes myths about meat and protein and strength, and elaborated on the advantages of vegetarianism. It’s not just about maximizing performance and benefit to self, it also sheds light on the benefits to our planet and flora-fauna. <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/virat-kohli-vegan-diet-here-s-what-the-ace-cricketer-stays-fit-without-relying-on-animal-and-dairy-products/5db17dce87fb571eff7e2f73">ALSO READ: Virat Kohli Birthday Special: Here's A Glimpse Into The Indian Skipper's Vegan Diet That Helps Him Stay Fit And Fab</a></p>

      <p>The Game Changers, with its huge claims about plant-based diet improving performance and strength, has got a lot of people convinced that they should turn vegan. However, there has also been a lot of criticism and many expressed their doubts about its scientific validity. However, Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma appreciated the documentary. Anushka had once tweeted, “Since I turned vegetarian, the question I’m asked the most is ‘Where do you get your protein from?’. The film, The Game Changers on Netflix is my answer to all those questions forever,” while Virat had tweeted, “Saw game changers on Netflix. Being a vegetarian athlete has made me realise what I have believed all these years regarding diet was a myth. What an amazing documentary and yes I’ve never felt better in my life after I turned vegetarian.”</p>
