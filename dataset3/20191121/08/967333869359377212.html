      <p>A massive burst of solar energy that hit the planet earlier this week <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201803171062622417-mysterious-purple-auroras/">will cause Northern Lights</a> to be seen in some parts of the United States and Canada, scholars announced on Wednesday.</p>
      <blockquote>"Weather permitting, highly active auroral displays will be visible overhead from Inuvik, Yellowknife, Rankin and Iqaluit to Juneau, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Thunder Bay and Sept-Iles, and visible low on the horizon from Seattle, Des Moines, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston, and Halifax", the University of Alaska-Fairbanks Geophysical Institute stated.</blockquote>

      <p>The Northern or polar lights can often be seen in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, as a result of powerful solar winds that cause disturbances in the atmosphere, hitting it with a flow of the electrically charged particles, and creating a colourful glow in the sky.</p>
