        <b>A man has been jailed for 18 months after racially abusing a staff member at a Tesco supermarket.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Christopher French, 30, racially abused and threatened the staff member at the Marks Farm superstore in Braintree a number of times between May and June, having already been banned from the store at the time the offences took place.</p>
      <p>French, of Plaiters Way, Braintree, denied racially aggravated harassment and a theft from the shop in June.</p>
      <p>He denied the offences but was found guilty by a jury of both counts at Chelmsford Crown Court on Tuesday, November 7.</p>
      <p>French was sentenced the next day to a total of 18 months in prison and was given a restraining order for three years.</p>
