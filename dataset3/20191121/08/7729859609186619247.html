        <b>Teams in the Dutch Eredivisie plan to stand still and not play during the first minute of their matches this weekend in protest against racism.</b>
      </p>
      <p>All players from the top two Netherlands divisions are expected to abstain from action while the slogan 'Racism? Then we don't play football' displays on scoreboards.</p>
      <p>The un-played minute will be added at the end of the game, the league has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The action has been taken after Excelsior player <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11906/11863973/memphis-depay-hits-out-after-excelsior-striker-walks-off-after-alleged-racist-abuse">Ahmad Mendes Moreira was allegedly racially abused by supporters last weekend in their game against Den Bosch</a>.</p>
      <p>Moreira walked off in the clash, consoled by team-mates as he left the pitch following an incident near the home fans in the Eerste Divisie - the Dutch second division - clash.</p>

      <p>The game continued after a delay, with Moreira scoring to put his side 2-1 ahead in a match that eventually finished 3-3, and the Dutch FA confirmed afterwards that it is investigating the incident.</p>
      <p>The KNVB also said the protocol for dealing with such instances was implemented correctly by the match officials.</p>
      <p>Netherlands and Lyon star Memphis Depay subsequently called for action to be taken, saying he was "sick and tired" of such incidents.</p>
