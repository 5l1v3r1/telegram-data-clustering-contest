      <p>BJP president <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/who-is-amit-shah">Amit Shah </a>kicked off his party's campaign for the Jharkhand assembly polls on Thursday with the promise of catapulting the state to the top position in terms of development.</p>
      <p>He lauded the Raghubar Das government for "freeing" the state of the Naxal menace in the last five years.</p>
      <p>"Atal ji (Atal Bihari Vajpayee) created Jharkhand and Narendra Modi will embellish and spruce it up," he told an election rally in Manika.</p>
      <p>"People kept dying, youth sacrificed their lives, but the dream of statehood remained unfulfilled under Congress rule," he said.</p>
      <p>Shah thanked the Jharkhand unit of the party for giving him the opportunity to launch the poll campaign from Latehar district, the land of legendary freedom fighter Birsa Munda.</p>
