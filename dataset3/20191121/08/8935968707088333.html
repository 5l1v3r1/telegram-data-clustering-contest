      <p>AT&amp;T announced it has activated the first 400G optical connection carrying live internet traffic on its network. The company claims the link between Dallas and Atlanta is a first in the industry, with the network built on white box hardware. The US operator plans to roll out 400G across its network next year to support the growing traffic demand from customers and its 5G network</p>
      <p>The first connection uses an SDN-enabled Ultra Long Haul system from Ciena. The 400G circuit was routed and configured completely through software using Ciena’s Manage, Control and Plan domain controller. The 400G transport was terminated in the Dallas and Atlanta offices by a white box router from UfiSpace that is compliant with the Broadcom Jericho2 Distributed Disaggregated Chassis design that AT&amp;T recently submitted to the Open Compute Project.</p>
      <p>400G pluggable transceivers from InnoLight were installed in the white box router and Ciena transponder to create the cross-office connectivity between the packet and optical technologies. Ciena’s MCP controller is integrated into AT&amp;T’s ONAP management and control framework using an API specified by the Open ROADM Multi-Source Agreement.</p>
      <p>The optical transport system consists of a new 400G transponder based on Ciena’s WaveLogic Ai coherent optical technology. The Ciena Reconfigurable Optical Add/Drop Multiplexors have been upgraded with new software to support flex grid. This allows the operator, through software control, to optimize the allocation of spectrum on the long-haul fibre based on the required speed and reach of each wavelength.</p>
      <p>The Broadcom Jericho2 white box was supplied by UfiSpace and provides 10 x 400G interfaces on a 2RU 'pizza box'. The white box uses the Broadcom Jericho2 packet processing chip, designed to meet the demanding needs of a service provider. The transceiver supplied by InnoLight conforms with the QSFP-DD MSA and is capable of transporting 400G signals on up to 2 km of single-mode fibre.</p>
