      <h1>Logan Paul’s appeal against controversial KSI loss being formally investigated</h1>

      <p>Logan Paul recently announced that he would be launching an appeal over the decision which meant he lost his boxing rematch with KSI – and it is now being formally investigated.</p>
      <p>The YouTuber, 24, had a crucial two points deducted for holding and punching KSI, which ultimately cost him the fight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/logan-paul-insists-not-sore-loser-officially-challenges-ksi-fight-result-punishment-simply-not-fit-crime-11172289/">Logan filed an appeal with the California State Athletic Commission,</a> who have confirmed they will be formally investigating.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for CSAC told TMZ: ‘The executive director Andy Foster is evaluating. If there’s sufficient grounds, it’ll go to a hearing at a commission meeting.’</p>
      <p>KSI ended up winning the fight, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eddie-hearn-pinpoints-moment-logan-paul-threw-away-knockout-victory-ksi-11147680/">after the referee issued Logan with the two-point deduction in the fourth round after he threw a shot at KSI’s head</a> after he was knocked down.</p>
      <p>Logan claimed he wasn’t planning on making excuses for the loss, but decided to appeal after watching the fight back later.</p>

      <p>He explained: ‘The 2 point deduction was the reason I full out split decision lost the fight. My team and I have decided to file an official appeal for the fight because we just <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/10/won-ksi-vs-logan-paul-rematch-11073380/">don’t believe that the outcome was right.</a></p>

      <p>‘It just resonates with me to my core. One of my biggest fears about this is being a sore loser and that’s why I made this video a week after the fight.</p>
      <p>‘I really had to check myself and make sure I wasn’t doing this because I was afraid of losing.</p>

      <p>‘Historically I’ve taken big Ls. By no means am I afraid of losing. I welcome it because it’s the only way I tend to experience growth in my life. But I truthfully, 100 per cent believe I did not lost this fight.</p>
      <p>‘This is just a plea to the California State Athletic commission, I would just hope that you guys give this the weight it deserves.’</p>
      <p>With confirmation the Athletic Commission is going to investigate whether the two-point deduction was indeed fair, or too harsh a punishment, Logan will soon find out whether the decision may be changed.</p>
