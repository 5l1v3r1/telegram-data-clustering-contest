      <p>The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has condemned the proposed death penalty for flouting Hate Speech, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>According to the governors, the National Assembly should hold a public hearing on the bill to ensure that the views of Nigerians were captured in the passage of the bill.</p>
      <p>NGF Vice Chairman and Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal, gave the advice while fielding questions from newsmen at the end of the forum meeting held on Wednesday night in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The Sokoto governor advised the federal lawmakers to respect the views of Nigerians on the bill.</p>
      <p>“I am not sure I have heard any governor come out to say he is in support of the death penalty for hate speech.</p>
      <p>“I believe the National Assembly should hold a public hearing on that bill so that due process of lawmaking is followed, so that the views of Nigerians not just the governors will be well captured on that bill.</p>
      <p>“They should respect the views of Nigerians in whatever may be the direction of debate and the eventual passage or otherwise of that bill,” Tambuwal said.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the governors’ position on the Finance Bill submitted to the NASS by President Muhammadu Buhari to increase Value Added Tax (VAT) from five to 7.5. percent, Tambuwal appealed to Nigerians to show more understanding with the Federal Government,” he said.</p>
      <p>He added that the governors were in support of what would improve the revenue generation drive of both the federal and state governments.</p>
      <p>“We are appealing to those who probably have no proper understanding of the context of those bills to kindly have a rethink of them and reflect on the quantum of work ahead of us.</p>
      <p>”As a country and states, we need a lot of resources to turn around infrastructure, to invest in education, healthcare and every sector of our national life.</p>
      <p>“There is an urgent need for more revenue in Nigeria. So, I appeal that we should show more understanding with the Federal Government in that regard,” he said.</p>
