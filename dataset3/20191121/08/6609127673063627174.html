      <p>Player data from the qualifying group stage of the UEFA Nations League forms the initial basis for the rankings, with updates every matchday to factor in players’ subsequent displays in the European Qualifiers, UEFA Nations League Finals and international friendlies.</p>
      <p>McGinn played in eight Group I matches for his country and scored a total of seven goals, including two in Tuesday’s 3-1 victory over Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>From those games, the 25-year-old has a 80 per cent pass accuracy, completing 159 out of 200.</p>
      <p>McGinn also has two assists to his name, while his ‘recovered balls’ tally was 23.</p>
      <p>Netherlands forward Memphis Depay tops the rankings.</p>
      <p>Former Hibs and St Mirren midfielder McGinn is sixth on the list behind England’s Jordan Pickford (3), Harry Kane (12), Raheem Sterling (15), Harry Maguire (17) and Marcus Rashford (29) when taking into account players representing the home nations.</p>
