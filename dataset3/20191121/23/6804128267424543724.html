      <h1>Lille president provides major Luis Campos update in blow to Jose Mourinho and Tottenham</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho has already poached two members of Lille's coaching staff</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:50:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:50</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Lille president Gerard Lopez has confirmed that sporting director Luis Campos will not join Jose Mourinho's new set-up at Tottenham Hotspur.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> has already appointed Joao Sacramento from the French side as his assistant at Spurs, with former assistant Rui Faria now embarking on his own managerial career in Qatar. Goalkeeping coach Nuno Santos has also left Lille to move to north London.</p>
      <p>The arrival of the pair came as part of a significant restructure at Spurs following Mauricio Pochettino's departure and Mourinho's arrival.</p>
      <p>However, Lopez confirmed on Thursday that Campos would not walk away from his position with the Ligue 1 side, having been linked with a director of football role in north London.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2019/lille-president-gerard-lopez-confirms-that-luis-campos-wont-join-tottenham/">RMC Sport</a>, the Lille President said: “Luis and I, we are colleagues but above all friends, and we are working on a project together with a huge trajectory.</p>
      <p>"And the project is far from finished. He will not leave the club. He stays with us.”</p>
      <p>Speaking last month, Campos had admitted he would like the opportunity to work with Mourinho when speaking to Sky Sports:</p>
      <p>"Mourinho is like a brother to me. I know him very well and for a long time. He’s a wonderful person and the best coach in the world. So, of course, if he called me I would speak."</p>
