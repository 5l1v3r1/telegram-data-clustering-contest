      <p>ROME, Nov 22 — An Italian judge has set a February date for the trial of two US teenagers charged with killing a police officer during a botched drug deal in Rome. </p>
      <p>The killing of Mario Cerciello Rega, who was in plain clothes when he was stabbed to death on July 26, sparked a national outcry.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Judge Chiara Gallo set a February 26 trial date in the case against Finnegan Elder, 19, and Gabriel Natale Hjorth, 18, who are being held in a Rome jail.</p>
      <p>Both are facing charges of voluntary manslaughter and attempted extortion, according to Italian media reports.</p>
      <p>Police have said that Elder confessed to stabbing Cerciello Rega, 35, with a combat knife.</p>
      <p>Cerciello Rega and his partner intercepted the teens after an intermediary on a drug deal reported them to the police for stealing his bag after they were sold aspirin instead of cocaine.</p>
      <p>Police tracked the teens to their four-star hotel after the attack, where they found a large knife hidden in the false ceiling of their room.</p>
      <p>Many questions remain about the events of the night, but on Tuesday <i>La Repubblica</i> newspaper published leaked, intercepted statements from Elder in prison saying the teens knew that Cerciello Rega and his partner, Andrea Varriale, were police as they identified themselves as such. — AFP</p>
