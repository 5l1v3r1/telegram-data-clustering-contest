      <p>MADRID: Serbia sealed their place in the Davis Cup quarter-finals in straightforward fashion on Thursday, brushing France aside to join Spain, Australia, Canada, Russia and Germany in a powerful-looking knockout phase.</p>
      <p>Filip Krajinovic's opening 7-5 7-6 victory over Jo-Wilfried Tsonga effectively guaranteed Serbia their last-eight spot before Novak Djokovic beat Benoit Paire 6-3 6-3 to put them 2-0 ahead in the Group A clash at La Caja Magica.</p>

      <p>Djokovic, who inspired his nation to the title in 2010, is now on a 14-match winning streak in Davis Cup singles matches.</p>
      <p>Germany made sure of their place in the last-eight when veteran Philipp Kohlschreiber beat Chile's Nicolas Jarry in the opening rubber of their Group C tie.</p>
      <p>Even a 2-1 defeat for the Germans would mean they qualify in first place ahead of Argentina who were left to sweat on scraping through as one of the best two runners-up.</p>
      <p>Britain rested Andy Murray for their deciding clash in Group E against Kazakhstan after his near three-hour singles thriller during his country's 2-1 win over the Netherlands on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>His replacement Kyle Edmund beat Mikhail Kukushkin 6-3 6-3 before Dan Evans lost to youngster Alexander Bublik, who was cheered on by a couple of hundred colourful Kazakh fans equipped with drums and trombones.</p>
      <p>The match will be decided by the doubles clash scheduled to be between Jamie Murray and Neal Skupski and the Kazakh pairing of Andrey Golubev and Aleksandr Nedovyesov.</p>
      <p>Whichever nation wins that will top the group and face Germany in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Later the first quarter-final takes place when an impressive-looking Australia side take on Canada, who have enjoyed the benefit of a rest day.</p>
      <p>Thursday's schedule looks far less complicated than on the previous two days when play has finished in the small hours, attracting criticism about the new Davis Cup format.</p>
      <p>The previous night the U.S. and Italy contested what was effectively a dead rubber until 4am.</p>
      <p>This is the first edition of 119-year-old Davis Cup since the ITF voted to change from the old year-long World Group featuring home and away ties to an 18-nation showdown in one venue played over a week.</p>
