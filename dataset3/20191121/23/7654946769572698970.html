      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas — If you’ve been searching for the opportune time to visit Antarctica, consider 2022. It’s not like you’ll be missing any baseball.</p>
      <p>OK, it’s too soon to set in stone Major League Baseball’s first work stoppage since the 1994-95 dumpster fire that slashed and burned the game to within a few inches of its life. However, each time a person of importance speaks <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/17/mlb-commissioner-fires-back-at-players-for-strike-talk/">about the current dynamic</a> between the Commissioner’s Office and the Players Association, that dynamic sound increasingly worse. The Basic Agreement between the two sides runs through the 2021 season.</p>
      <p>At the conclusion of the owners’ meetings Thursday, commissioner Rob Manfred addressed <a href="https://mlb.nbcsports.com/2019/11/20/rob-manfred-tells-mlbpa-there-will-be-no-economic-concessions-for-labor-peace/">a report by NBC Sports</a> that, in a bargaining session last July, he refused to make economic concessions in return for labor peace. Manfred offered his version of what transpired.</p>
      <p>During the session, attended by Manfred, his deputy Dan Halem, PA executive director Tony Clark and head negotiator Bruce Meyer, “Mr. Meyer suggested a series of changes that would turn the Basic Agreement back 50 years,” Manfred said. “Would essentially give back to the union everything we’ve achieved over the last few decades.</p>
      <p>“I asked in response to his suggestion what was in that deal for the clubs. And he said ‘Labor peace.’</p>
      <p>“… I said to him [that] labor peace is a mutual benefit. It’s not something they can trade economics against. It is a mutual benefit. It keeps the players working and it keeps our business going forward. That’s how the conversation went.”</p>
      <p>The Players Association didn’t return a request for comment.</p>
