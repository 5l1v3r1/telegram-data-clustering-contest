      <p>A Turkish Airlines Boeing 737 (TC-JGZ), flying from Istanbul, had its front gear break off during a hard landing in Odesa Airport Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://dumskaya.net/news/samolet-aviakompanii-turkish-airlines-podlomil-p-105677/">Dumskaya </a>outlet, the crew managed to safely bring the plane to a halt, while staying within the runway – between the third and fourth taxiways.</p>
      <p>All passengers were evacuated through inflatable ramps.</p>
      <p>No casualties have been reported.</p>
      <p>The report says strong winds in the airport area hindered the first landing attempt, and the hard landing came at the second attempt.</p>
