      <p>Although we still have no confirmation of a <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Zoey-101-Cast-Reunion-Photos-46436769">long-rumored <b>Zoey 101</b> reboot</a>, the cast of the show are getting together for another nostalgic reason: a <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/zoey-101-reunion-jamie-lynn-spears-joins-cast-on-all-that/">new version of <b>All That</b>'s sketch</a> <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/The+Most+Memorable+'All+That'+Skits+of+All+Time/articles/RO1rbZckQSb/Thelma+Stump">"Thelma Stump."</a> Spears shared a photo on Thursday smiling alongside her former <b>Zoey 101</b> cast members Paul Butcher, Sean Flynn, Kristin Herrera, Chris Massey, Erin Sanders, and Matthew Underwood on set at Nickelodeon. The <a href="https://people.com/tv/jaime-lynn-spears-set-to-reunite-with-zoey-101-cast-on-nickelodeons-all-that/">all-new "Thelma Stump" episode</a> will air in 2020, according to <b>People</b>.</p>
      <p>To refresh your memory, Spears starred in the hilarious reoccurring sketch in the early 2000s as a stubborn bodyguard in her 80s named Thelma Stump who gave <b>All That</b> cast members a hard time. She'd often demand to see their pass if they wanted to access the set, and she was typically found in a rocking chair singing "Ain't No Sunshine When She's Gone." Who could forget the episodes with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlcZ2YfV6W0">Britney Spears and her little sis</a>? The 28-year-old singer and actress is also returning to the small screen with a role on <a href="https://www.etonline.com/jamie-lynn-spears-is-returning-to-acting-with-new-netflix-series-sweet-magnolias-127920">Netflix's upcoming series <b>Sweet Magnolias</b></a>. This isn't the full <b>Zoey 101</b> update we were hoping for, but it's enough to hold us over!</p>
