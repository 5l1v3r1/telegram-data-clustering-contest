      <p><b>THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: </b>Congress leaders expect changes on the list of proposed KPCC office-bearers, now before the high command, after the hue and cry over a jumbo panel.</p>
      <p>KPCC president Mullapally Ramachandran is against such a large forum and he has ensured that the leadership listens to his opposition.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It was evident when he vented his frustration against the factional pressures at the DCC presidents' meeting held here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>When he assumed office on September 19 last year, he had three working presidents, M. I. Shanavas, K. Sudhakaran and Kodikunnil Suresh. But the death of Mr Shanavas and the election of the other two to Lok Sabha left him alone.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the two MPs want to continue in their roles, which has not gone down well with the president and other leaders.</p>
      <p>Besides, the two dominant factions suggested Thampanoor Ravi and V. D. Satheesan also in the same roles.</p>
      <p>“What can we do when they tell the leadership they don’t have plans to step down? So we suggested only Mr Satheesan and Mr Ravi,” said a former president.</p>
      <p>Mr Ramachandran only forwarded the lists given by Oommen Chandy, Ramesh Chennithala, MPs and his predecessors.</p>
      <p>But a senior MP acted smart and gave three sets of lists to him and the AICC leadership.</p>
      <p>Another former KPCC president said since complaints against the proposed jumbo list are mounting before the AICC, Congress president Sonia Gandhi will come up with a shorter list.</p>
      <p>“Rahul Gandhi is expected to be back in New Delhi by Friday after which AICC organising general secretary K. C. Venugopal and his deputy in-charge of Kerala, Mukul Wasnik, will huddle together and finalise the list,” he told DC.</p>
