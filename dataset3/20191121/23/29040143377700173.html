      <p><b>Best</b> PlayStation 4 Controllers Android Central 2019</p>
      <p>The stock controller for the PlayStation 4 is good, but it's not for everyone. Fortunately, there are a lot of options out there that offer a different experience, whether you're a competitive gamer, have kids who want to play, or just want to sharpen up your experience. Pick up one of these options if you're looking for something to change up your play.</p>
      <p>Black Friday is a great time to grab different controllers. It's one of the busiest shopping seasons of the entire year, so retailers have a lot of incentive to drop the prices of their various products. Whether you're looking for an official controller from Sony or something a little more custom, you should be able to find a sale or discounted item that'll fit your needs.</p>

      <p>Staff pick</p>
      <p>This is expensive, there's no denying it, but the Astro C40 TR is amazing, so it justifies the cost. The sheer number of customizable parts is staggering. From trigger stops to movable thumbsticks, the Astro can be anything you want it to be. I just wish it could be about $50 cheaper. Still, as far as tournament-ready controllers go, this is one of the best.</p>

      <p>Scuf controllers are used by a large portion of the pro-gamers who play on console, and the Vantage is the company's latest and greatest effort for the PS4. The basic shape is similar to the regular PlayStation DualShock 4, though it's built from the ground up. It features offset thumbsticks along with two additional Sax buttons on the side for extra precision and customization.</p>

      <p>The Razer Raiju Ultimate is one of the best that the company has to offer. It features app support for you to easily remap buttons and save different configurations in the cloud, and the feel of its face buttons and triggers are just impeccable, leading to precision when gaming. The downside is that this controller must be shipped from the U.K. as it's not available in U.S. stores yet.</p>

      <p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it, right? The DualShock 4 is the standard controller that comes in the box and therefore, comes with the design we've come to expect. If you like it already but wish it were a little more interesting, Sony has a wide range of different colors available.</p>

      <p>Some folks love PS4 but wish the controller was more like the Xbox One's with its offset analog sticks. Many find this layout more ergonomic, which makes the Nacon Revolution V2 a great option to try. It's wired, so you can't sit too far away from the console, but the shape and layout are pretty similar to what you'd find with the Xbox. Plus, its use of USB-C means you can add it to your modern electronics collection without having to add more wires.</p>

      <p>Need a solid controller for younger, smaller hands that doesn't cost a lot? Or maybe you're a traveling PS4 gamer that needs something compact? That's where the excellent Hori Mini Wired Gamepad comes in. As the name implies, this is a wired controller. The touchpad is missing, which is okay, but there's a button in place for when you might need it.</p>

      <p>One of the only controllers specifically designed for fighting games, the HORI Fighting Commander places the R1 and R2 buttons on the same side of the pad as the regular face buttons in a configuration that's perfect for pulling off combos in your favorite fighting games. It ditches the analog sticks to give you more room to put those combos in, and extra features like an R/L toggle and a programmable Turbo button ensure you can use it comfortably with any fighter.</p>

      <h3>So many choices</h3>
      <p>There's no shortage of options for great PlayStation 4 controllers. Everything listed here will offer a very enjoyable gaming experience no matter your choice of genre. We especially want to highlight the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASTRO-Gaming-C40-TR-Controller-PlayStation/dp/B07KF1FB1F/?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU65547YYw">Astro C40 TR</a> for its ability to allow players to swap the positions of the thumbsticks.</p>
      <p>Cheap is about the only thing you <i>can't</i> call it. However, what you get for the unsettling price tag is a controller that'll give you the range of motion you need, all while improving your mechanical ability with its rear-facing paddle buttons, tunable triggers, and interchangeable analog sticks.</p>
      <p>Of course, you really can't go wrong with the original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FQ74V4Z?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU65547YYw">DualShock 4</a>. It's designed with PlayStation in mind after all, and if you just want a second controller for the occasional guest, go cheap. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-Fighting-Commander-PlayStation-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01GVOFIAA?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU65547YYw">Hori Fighting Commander</a> is another excellent budget controller for player two.</p>
      <h3>How to choose the best Black Friday deals on PlayStation 4 controllers</h3>
      <p>When looking for Black Friday deals on PlayStation 4 controllers, the first question to ask is: what are you looking for? Are you interested in a standard DualShock 4 directly from Sony, or are you looking for a custom, third-party controller? Regardless of what you're looking for, be sure to check the prices before Black Friday actually begins in order to know how much you'll be saving.</p>
      <p>If you're just interested in grabbing another DualShock 4, Sony has confirmed that its line of standard controllers will be discounted by $20. If you are instead taking a look at a specialized third-party controller, something high-end like Scuf or ASTRO may be of interest, though these will naturally be pricier, even during Black Friday.</p>
      <p>We'll be keeping you updated on specific discounts for PlayStation 4 controllers as we see them.
