      <h1>Samsung’s Galaxy Fold is coming to Canada after all for $2,599</h1>
      <h2>The pricey smartphone will be sold exclusively at Samsung Experience stores in Toronto</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:41:22+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/patrickorourke" target="_blank">Patrick O'Rourke</a></address>
      <p>Despite cancelling the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/09/05/samsung-galaxy-fold-not-coming-canada/">Galaxy Fold’s Canadian release in early September</a>, Samsung has announced that the company’s first foldable smartphone is coming to Canada in a limited capacity.</p>
      <p>The pricey device — which costs $2,599 CAD — is set to be sold exclusively at Samsung Experience Stores in the Greater Toronto Area starting on December 6th, 2019.</p>
      <p>Specific Samsung Experience locations where the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/04/16/samsung-galaxy-fold-hands-on/">Galaxy Fold</a> will be available include the CF Toronto Eaton Centre, CF Sherway Gardens and Yorkdale Shopping Centre.</p>
      <p>“Canadians have overwhelmingly shared their excitement for the Galaxy Fold, and we’re thrilled to now be offering it at our Samsung Experiences Stores across Canada,” said Jennifer Safruk, vice president of sales and product management at Samsung in a recent statement.</p>
      <p>Samsung says that every Galaxy Fold purchase features “exclusive access to Galaxy Fold Premiere Service,” which includes a screen repair offer and 24/7 technical support available at ‘1-888-970-FOLD.’</p>
      <p>The Fold will only be available in ‘Cosmos Black’ in Canada. The smartphone was originally supposed to release in Canada in the Summer of 2019.</p>
      <p>Back in September when Samsung told <i>MobileSyrup</i> that its first foldable smartphone was no longer <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/09/05/samsung-galaxy-fold-not-coming-canada/">making its way to Canada</a>, the South Korean tech giant released the following statement:</p>
      <p>“Given that the Galaxy Fold will be available in limited quantities across the globe and taking into consideration the improvements made, we had to revisit the global launch plan While we greatly appreciate consumers’ interest in Galaxy Fold, unfortunately, the Galaxy Fold will not be available in Canada.”</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Fold was first released in South Korea on September 6th and the United States on September 27th.</p>
      <p>The innovative handset’s original release schedule was <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/04/17/early-galaxy-fold-smartphones-experiencing-display-issues/">pushed back due to design issues</a> with early review units that suffered from debris getting stuck behind the foldable smartphone’s display, as well as some media removing a protector that held the device’s screen together.</p>
      <p>As a result of these issues, Samsung made subtle changes to the retail version’s design, including extending the protective film under the bezels so that it can’t be peeled off, as well as improving the build quality of the hinge by shrinking the gap present when the device is closed.</p>
      <p>The Galaxy Fold’s front-facing 4.6-inch screen is tiny and features massive bezels on the top and bottom. The interior displays fold out to reveal what is essentially a 7.3-inch tablet-sized panel inside. The smartphone also features a Snapdragon 855 processor, 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage.</p>
      <p>Samsung is already rumoured to be working on a <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/15/samsung-rumoured-galaxy-fold-launch-canada/">cheaper version of the Galaxy Fold</a> that smartphone leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1195337713487998976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1195337713487998976&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmobilesyrup.com%2F2019%2F11%2F15%2Fsamsung-rumoured-galaxy-fold-launch-canada%2F">Ishan Agarwal (@ishanagarwal34)</a> says will be released in Canada.</p>
