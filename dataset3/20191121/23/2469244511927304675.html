      <p>A young man in his twenties is having a storming innings with his business – Harry Solomon from Wombat Cricket ran away with the Young Business Person of the Year title at the awards – an accolade he took home at this year’s Plymouth Business Awards, too.</p>
      <p>‘Fun loving, honourable and tenacious’ James Staughton, who has worked his way up through St Austell Brewery and has played a huge role in shaping the successful business, scooped the Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
      <p>A moving video from his colleagues was played to a huge audience at the Plymouth Pavilions on the evening of November 21. James, the great-grandson of the company’s founder Walter Hicks, has been with the brewery since 1980 – and in January 2020, after 40 years of dedication, he is set to retire.</p>
      <p>The two businessmen were amongst dozens of worthy businesses nominated in the prestigious Western Morning News Business Awards, which celebrates the best and brightest of the Westcountry.</p>
      <p>The glittering event also celebrated 160 years of the Western Morning News, with editors past and present attending the ceremony.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Winner: Cornwall Council Together for Families</b>
      </p>
      <p>A campaign was planned to take advantage of National Foster Care Fortnight in May to kick start a long term drive to reach deeper into Cornish communities, increase the number of enquiries and begin to build the number of foster carers across Cornwall to look after those who have suffered abuse and trauma in their young lives. Alongside traditional media channels, new ways of reaching out into communities were sought to create a short-term, hard-hitting, profile building campaign which could then be continued on a lower scale but still maintaining impact. The Foster Care Fortnight campaign featured two young girls dressed as superheroes with the tagline – Fostering changes lives. Cornwall Council had a record number of 25 attending the subsequent information session at County Hall and numbers of enquiries continue to stabilise, enabling them to work on widening the pool of potential foster carers to care for Cornish children in need of loving homes.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Five Bells is a 16th century, Grade II listed thatched pub set between Exeter and Cullompton run by James and Charlie Garnham. They took over in mid-December 2017 when the pub’s future was very unclear following the previous landlord’s sudden departure. After a change in approach from the business in 2018, local drinkers are now equally as welcome as dogs, children and cyclists. Having grown up in the village, it was always James’ dream to one day own The Five Bells having spent his career running establishments around the country. Subsequently, the pub aims to give its customers a unique experience and exceed their expectations at every turn. The pub appointed a new female head chef in August 2019 who has settled in superbly and has already put a very strong emphasis on catering for a wide range of dietary requirements including vegan and coeliac. James oversees nearly every shift and will welcome guests on arrival. Regardless of monetary spend, or the reason for visiting, each customer is valued and made to feel extremely welcome.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Cornish Seafood company ‘Ideal Foods’ has been trading internationally for more than 28 years, selling a variety of fish and shellfish to customers in more than 40 countries. Most of their business is done outside of the UK and for the year ending 28th February 2019, 87% of sales came from exports. Ideal Foods takes sustainability very seriously and prides itself on using all of the fish. They are a pioneering company in that they offer fish processors the opportunity to sell all parts of the fish and they then source markets for these products. Two years ago, they launched their own pet food brand ‘Purely Fish’, with a range of 100% natural treats, canned wet food, toppers and raw food for cats and dogs, all made from fish. More recently, the business launched a new trademark, ‘Love Fish, Hate Waste’ under which they plan to bring their own ‘Wonky Veg’ line of value added fish retail packs to the supermarkets.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>2019 marks the thirtieth anniversary year of Callestick Farm Ice Cream – a company launched by the Parker family in 1989. Until then, Simon and Judith Parker had been rearing animals and growing cereals on the land they first bought in 1953. Milk quotas meant a massive 10% drop in the family income, so the couple’s son Sebastian and his wife Angela came up with the idea of making ice-cream. The business has grown in every sense since with the farm now ten times its original size and a herd of 345 cows helping to produce at least 700,000 litres of award-winning ice-cream each year. Recent achievements include a landmark £500,000 export deal with China earlier this year, accounting for 11.4% of anticipated 2019 sales. Collaboration with celebrity food entrepreneur Levi Roots has also just been announced. The ground breaking range of spicy Caribbean-inspired products will be on supermarket shelves in early 2020.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Over the past 40 years, James has played a pivotal role in the extraordinary growth of one of the South West's most successful independent, family-run businesses. The great-great grandson of Walter Hicks, the founder of St Austell Brewery, James joined the business in 1980, at the age of 21, as an apprentice. During his time at the helm, St Austell Brewery has grown dramatically. This year the company reached the milestone of selling 150,000 brewers’ barrels of its own brand beers in a calendar year – the first time in its 168-year history. By comparison, when James started in his role as managing director, the brewery produced 15,000 barrels per year. James is a huge supporter of pubs as well as beer and during his tenure, St Austell Brewery pubs have reinvented themselves to adapt to the changing habits of consumers with food and accommodation now accounting for over 50% of revenue in the managed pub estate. Not wanting the brewery to rest on its laurels, James led the landmark acquisition of Bath Ales in 2016, and the opening of the Hare Brewery in 2018 - a new production facility in Bristol with the capacity to produce more than 50,000 brewers’ barrels of beer. James will retire as CEO in January, after 20 years. He will then take on the honorary role of president of the company and will continue to support the business in an ambassadorial role.</p>
