      <blockquote>Victoria has recorded its fourth consecutive year of above-trend economic growth in 2018-19, with results well above the national average and the highest of the mainland states.<br/><br/>Australian Bureau of Statistics data released today shows Victoriaâ€™s real gross state product grew by 3 per cent in 2018-19. By comparison, national growth was just 1.9 per cent for the year.</blockquote>
