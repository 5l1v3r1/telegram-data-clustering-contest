      <p>Apple is known for tackling the grandest of human challenges: best-of-class computational tools, responsible manufacturing, equal rights and respect for all, disaster relief, powerful story telling, privacy, security, and great planetary stewardship.</p>
      <p>Elevator music isn’t a worthy endeavor.</p>
      <p>Recently, our Andrew Orr reported: “<a href="https://www.macobserver.com/news/product-news/apple-muzak-retail-stores/">Apple Music for Business Could Come to a Store Near You.</a>”</p>
      <blockquote>Apple is partnering with PlayNetwork Inc., which specializes in providing music for commercial use. Apple is the one that will create and suggest playlists to use for businesses. A lot of music licensed for commercial use is more expensive so businesses can potentially save money by switching to Apple Music.</blockquote>
      <p>Even if the rollout of iOS 13 and macOS Catalina were flawless, this news would have left a bad taste in my mouth. But, indeed, Apple is up to its ears in difficulties with these OSes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-21/apple-ios-14-features-changes-testing-after-ios-13-bugs">Inside Apple’s iPhone Software Shakeup After Buggy iOS 13 Debut</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-macos-catalina-is-not-apples-finest-moment/">Why macOS Catalina is not Apple’s finest moment</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Now, I’m not saying that Apple should defer all other initiatives until iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS and macOS are all perfect. But I am saying that Apple’s headlong rush into a trivial business music service reflect poorly on Apple’s allocation of talent, resources, focus and pride in workmanship in its core business.</p>
      <p>Steve Jobs wanted Apple to work at the intersection of the liberal arts and technology. That vision, among other things, informs Apple about whether a new project lifts the company up and inspires customers. Lots of projects can make money, but is a proposed project worthy of Apple? If not, the executive team usually says “no!”</p>
      <p>Is Tim Cook too tied up with China, tariffs, presidential politics and public appearances to veto such nonsense? Is Apple obsessed with capturing every possible nickel and dime of service revenue? <b>Can we expect Apple to launch a new line of therapeutic massage and beauty products next?</b></p>
      <p>This business music initiative has all the earmarks of an executive mandate for a revenue goal. Somewhere in Apple, some poor Director is sweating his/her performance evaluation and is being forced into cooking up schemes that look like new service revenue possibilities. No matter how mundane.</p>
      <p>This is not the Apple we have long admired.</p>
