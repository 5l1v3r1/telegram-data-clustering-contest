      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:24:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:24</time> by <a rel="author">Will Twigger, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/will-twigger/</a></address>
      <p>Pop legend Robbie Williams has hinted he may be too "expensive" to make a return to The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> .</p>
      <p>He and wife Ayda Field had judged on the show but announced earlier this year that they wouldn't be making a comeback.</p>
      <p>Robbie made a sensational appearance this evening at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park, London, and revealed that "something's gotta give" financially.</p>
      <p>When asked if they'd make a return, the Angels singer replied: "Look, it's expensive. We're expensive.</p>
      <p>"Something's gotta give there.</p>
      <p>"Maybe they did think about us, maybe they didn't."</p>
      <p>Robbie told that he doesn't know what's on the mind of head honcho <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/simon-cowell">Simon Cowell</a> .</p>
      <p>“I don’t know what's on Simon's mind," he said, "But I'll be meeting up with him before Christmas and I'll try to get it out of him."</p>

      <p>“Yeah, Santa’s real,” he laughed, “You’ll all know what I mean when you have kids.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got three kids and the wife is an incredible memory maker. She’s a professional memory maker.</p>

      <p>His big concern for the Christmas charts, though, is festive legend Michael Buble.</p>

      <p>“It’s an incredible album. It’s quality and he’s quality.</p>
      <p>“Where singles are concerned, I haven’t got a cat in hell’s chance. There might be a Christmas miracle.</p>
      <p>“My audience stream, and to be in the top 20, you need to stream the record.”</p>
