      <p>BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon’s top politicians are attending a military parade on the country’s 76th Independence Day.</p>
      <p>They appeared together Friday for the first time since the government resigned amid nationwide protests.</p>
      <p>Lebanon’s president, parliament speaker and resigned prime minister sat together under a canopy at the Defense Ministry.</p>
      <p>The traditional military parade in central Beirut has been called off as a protest camp still occupies the area, more than a month after anti-government demonstrations broke out.</p>
      <p>The limited Independence Day display reflects the nation’s somber mood.</p>
      <p>Lebanon is facing its most serious political and economic crises in years. A deadlock among the top leaders has failed to produce a government.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned two weeks into the protests, which have targeted Lebanon’s entire political class.</p>
