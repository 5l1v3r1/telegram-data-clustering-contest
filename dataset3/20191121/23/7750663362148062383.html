      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atletico-madrid/"><b>Atletico Madrid</b></a>'s pursuit of the top two in La Liga will continue on Saturday when they travel to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/granada/"><b>Granada</b></a>.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:06:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Law</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-simeone/"><b>Diego Simeone</b></a>'s side are currently third in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/la-liga/table.html">the table</a> with 24 points, while Granada are down in eighth with 20 points having also made a strong start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>

      <p>Six wins, two draws and five defeats - that is how Granada have performed this season. A total of 20 points has left them in eighth spot in the table, just four points behind their opponents this weekend.</p>
      <p>There are incredibly just five points between ninth-placed Valencia and league leaders Barcelona, while even Osasuna in 10th are only five points off the top three at this stage of the campaign.</p>
      <p>El Grana were only promoted back to La Liga for this season having finished second in the Segunda Division last term. They have not finished higher than 15th in Spain's top flight since 1973-74, but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-martinez/"><b>Diego Martinez</b></a>'s side certainly have a chance of claiming a top-half spot this term.</p>
      <p>Their form ahead of this match is concerning, though, when considering that they have lost each of their last three in the league. Indeed, after back-to-back defeats to Getafe and Real Sociedad, they entered the international break off the back of a 2-0 defeat at Valencia.</p>
      <p>Rojiblancos were actually top of La Liga at the end of October; it is not a surprise that the team have just started to slide down the table, but it has still been a very productive start to the campaign.</p>

      <p>With Barcelona and Real Madrid both showing weakness this season, Atletico will feel that they have a genuine chance of winning the title. Consistency has been a problem in the opening months, though, and it remains to be seen whether they are capable of launching a strong challenge.</p>
      <p>Simeone's side drew six of their eight league matches between September 21 and November 2 before recording an important 3-1 win over Espanyol before the international break. As mentioned, they are currently third in the table, just one point off the top two, who also both play on Saturday.</p>
      <p>No team has conceded fewer times in La Liga than Atletico this season, which is not a surprise. The Madrid club have really struggled down the other end, though, managing just 15 goals in their 13 matches to date.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alvaro-morata/"><b>Alvaro Morata</b></a> has shown impressive form in recent weeks - netting four in his last four league outings - but <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/diego-costa/"><b>Diego Costa</b></a> has only managed two La Liga goals this season, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joao-felix/"><b>Joao Felix</b></a> struck twice in nine matches before picking up an ankle problem.</p>
      <p>Atletico's next match after this one is at home to Barca next weekend, and Simeone will be demanding that his team pick up all three points ahead of the huge clash at the Wanda Metropolitano on December 1.</p>
      <p><b>Granada form:</b> LWWLLL</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neyder-lozano/"><b>Neyder Lozano</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/victor-diaz/"><b>Victor Diaz</b></a> are both still on the sidelines for Granada, but the home side are hopeful that experienced forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/roberto-soldado/"><b>Roberto Soldado</b></a> will shake off an illness to lead the line.</p>
      <p>The XI is not expected to be too dissimilar to the one that started against Valencia before the international break, meaning that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alvaro-vadillo/"><b>Alvaro Vadillo</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/antonio-puertas/"><b>Antonio Puertas</b></a> should both feature.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/darwin-machis/"><b>Darwin Machis</b></a> is one player pushing for a spot in the final third, though, and it would not be a surprise to see Martinez shuffle his pack following a disappointing run of form.</p>
      <p>As for Atletico, Felix is back in training following an ankle injury but is unlikely to start this weekend, meaning that Morata could be joined by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/angel-correa/"><b>Angel Correa</b></a> once again.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/saul-niguez/"><b>Saul Niguez</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/thomas-partey/"><b>Thomas Partey</b></a> are both suspended after picking up bookings against Espanyol, though, while defensive trio <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/stefan-savic/"><b>Stefan Savic</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-gimenez/"><b>Jose Gimenez</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sime-vrsaljko/"><b>Sime Vrsaljko</b></a> are all still injured.</p>
      <p>Atletico will also be without experienced striker Diego Costa for the next three months with the Brazilian-born Spain international forced to undergo a neck operation.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marcos-llorente/"><b>Marcos Llorente</b></a> is in line for a rare start in the middle of the park, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hector-herrera/"><b>Hector Herrera</b></a> is also expected to feature in a midfield spot for the capital giants.</p>
      <p><b>Granada possible starting lineup:</b> Silva; Quini, Duarte, Sanchez, Neva; Herrera, Gonalons; Puertas, Azeez, Vadillo; Soldado</p>
      <p><b>Atletico Madrid possible starting lineup:</b> Oblak; Tripper, Felipe, Hermoso, Lodi; Koke, Herrera, Llorente, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/vitolo/"><b>Vitolo</b></a>; Correa, Morata</p>

      <h3>We say: Granada 1-1 Atletico Madrid</h3>
      <p>Atletico will be without a number of key players once again, and it is difficult to back the visitors with any real confidence. It would certainly not be a surprise to see Simeone's side triumph, but we expect Granada to have enough to claim a point in front of their own supporters.</p>
