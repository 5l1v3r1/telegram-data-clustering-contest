      <h1>Fantasy Football Injury Updates: James Conner, Jordan Howard, Devonta Freeman, more RBs affect Week 12 start 'em, sit 'em calls</h1>

      <p>James Conner, Jordan Howard and Devonta Freeman all have potential to be starting fantasy RBs in Week 12 if they can make it back on the field, but that looks uncertain with the latest injury news that's come out about them. There are also injury questions about Phillip Lindsay, Matt Breida, Adrian Peterson, and Chris Thompson that are worth keeping an eye on, especially if you have Derrius Guice high on your Week 12 sleeper list. We have the latest updates ahead of start 'em, sit 'em decisions.</p>

      <h3>James Conner injury update</h3>
      <p>Conner (shoulder) <a href="https://twitter.com/bepryor/status/1197252470470299649">missed Wednesday's practice</a> ahead of a Sunday matchup with Cincinnati's terrible run defense. Benny Snell (knee) was a full participant and will compete with Trey Edmunds and Jaylen Samuels for touches Sunday.</p>
      <p>Snell becomes our favorite to lead Pittsburgh in carries as long as he's active and Conner is out, while Samuels should lead in total touches. Samuels will remain a solid PPR play and be usable as a FLEX in standard leagues.</p>

      </p>
      <h3>Jordan Howard injury news</h3>
      <p>After missing Week 11 due to a shoulder injury, Howard <a href="https://twitter.com/Jeff_McLane/status/1197583246009208834">was limited in Wednesday's and Thursday's practices</a>and has yet to be cleared for contact. The Eagles had expected him to be cleared for contact late last week, so the extended absence can't be encouraging. Philadelphia hosts the Seahawks at 1 p.m. ET Sunday.</p>
      <p>If Howard remains out, Miles Sanders should see nearly every snap at running back for the Eagles again and be a RB2 play in fantasy. If Howard plays, Sanders is at best a boom-or-bust FLEX option while Howard moves into RB2 territory.</p>

      <h3>Will Devonta Freeman play Week 12?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE: </b>Freeman <a href="https://twitter.com/vxmcclure23/status/1197590633462018048">missed practice again Thursday</a> and seems unlikely to play this week.</p>
      <p>Freeman <a href="https://twitter.com/vxmcclure23/status/1197179027636793344">missed Wednesday's practice</a> after Falcons head coach Dan Quinn said his running back was "trending in the right way" earlier in the week. Freeman's Friday practice status will probably be most telling about his availability for Sunday against the Bucs.</p>
      <p>Tampa Bay has a dominant run defense, which means Freeman wouldn't be an exciting play even if he's active. Brian Hill disappointed with 2.0 yards per carry last week, and although the touches would be there again this week, he'd be tough to start in fantasy if Freeman is out.</p>

      <h3>Is Matt Breida playing Sunday night?</h3>
      <p>Breida (ankle) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaioccoNBCS/status/1197251460603400192">missed Wednesday's practice</a>, and Kyle Shanahan expects a decision on his injury to come down to Sunday. The 49ers don't play until Sunday night against the Packers, so it could be a dicey injury to wait on for fantasy owners.</p>
      <p>Tevin Coleman hasn't been good of late, but you'll be starting him as an RB2 regardless of Breida's status. If Breida plays, he's a FLEX option, while his absence would make Raheem Mostert an equivalent FLEX option.</p>

      <h3>Phillip Lindsay injury news</h3>
      <p>Lindsay should be fine, but he popped up as <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisBrownBills/status/1197306136724160513">limited in Wednesday's practice</a> because of a foot injury that hadn't been noted before on injury reports for him. It at least bears watching after Lindsay doubled Royce Freeman in carries, 16-8, in Week 11.</p>
      <p>Denver's best chance to move the ball against Buffalo on Sunday may be on the ground, and as long as Lindsay is active, there's no reason his increased workload wouldn't continue and have him in the RB2 conversation. Freeman is only playable if Lindsay were to surprisingly miss out.</p>
      <h3>Adrian Peterson, Chris Thompson Week 12 status</h3>
      <p>Peterson <a href="https://twitter.com/JPFinlayNBCS/status/1197577532738027521">missed practice Wednesday and Thursday</a>, and while Bill Callahan referred to it as rest, Peterson was listed on the injury report as having turf toe. Pass-catching back Chris Thompson returned to practice after an extended absence, as well.</p>
      <p>The Redskins face the Lions' league-worst rush defense against fantasy RBs Sunday, so whoever is healthy here has fantasy appeal. A Thompson return would put a slight damper on the Derrius Guice hype for this week, although a Peterson absence would only ramp the hype back up.</p>
