      <p>According to multiple reports, French Montana has been hospitalized for an elevated heart rate compounded by intense stomach pain. TMZ reports that authorities were called to French's home in Calabasas in response to a possible burglary. What ended up being a false alarm turned out to be a blessing in disguise for French as responding deputies called for emergency medical personnel after noticing how unwell the rapper looked. </p>
      <p>French was taken to San Fernando Valley hospital where he was treated for severe nausea, stomach pain, and an elevated heart rate. A rep close to French points out the rapper's tour schedule and other endeavors might have a role in his condition over the past few weeks. </p>
