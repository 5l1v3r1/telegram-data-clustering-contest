      <h1>Pokémon Sword and Shield are Nintendo’s highest-grossing Pokémon games in Canada</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:54:05+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mobilesyrup.com/author/dean-daley" target="_blank">Dean Daley</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/pokemon-sword-shield-review/"><i>Pokémon Sword </i>and<i> Pokémon Shield</i> </a>are not only the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/pokemon-sword-shield-nintendo-fastest-selling-games/">fastest-selling Nintendo Switch games</a>, but they’re also the highest-grossing Pokémon titles in Canada. Nintendo has not released specific Canadian sales numbers for the game.</p>
      <p>It’s not surprising that these two games are outselling previous entries in the series. <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> are Pokémon’s debut main-entry releases for Nintendo’s Switch. Additionally, the game costs about $35 CAD more than previous main-entry games, as Nintendo’s handheld titles are usually cheaper.</p>
      <p><i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> is currently Nintendo’s eighth best-selling game worldwide for the Switch, with the title selling more than six million copies since its release last week. If the game maintains this pace, it could surpass <i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i> as Nintendo’s number one selling game for the Switch.</p>
      <p>That said, <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield </i>still has a long way before that happens. As of September 30th, <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2017/04/28/mario-kart-8-deluxe-nintendo-switch-review/"><i>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</i></a> has sold more than 19 million units worldwide.</p>
      <p><a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/pokemon-sword-shield-review/"><i>Pokémon Sword </i>and <i>Pokémon Shield</i></a> is available now for $79.99.</p>
      <p>Check out my thoughts on <i>Pokémon Sword </i>and <i>Pokémon Shield,</i> <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/21/pokemon-sword-shield-review/">here</a>.</p>
