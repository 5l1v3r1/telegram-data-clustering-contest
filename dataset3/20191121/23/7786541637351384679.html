      <p><b>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP)</b> - A person was injured, and five people were arrested during a demonstration by hundreds of protesters outside a University of California, Berkeley auditorium where conservative commentator Ann Coulter gave a speech, an official said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Between 1,500 and 2,000 demonstrators chanted slogans outside the event, where police put up a large water-filled barricade. Some demonstrators harassed people trying to enter the building, yelling at them and pushing them.</p>
      <p>Coulter tweeted "THANK YOU" on Thursday to the campus and city police who protected the venue.</p>
      <p>A person who had a ticket to the event was injured after scuffling with a protester and taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure, said Dan Mogulof, a university spokesman.</p>
      <p>"We don't believe the injuries were serious," he said.</p>
      <p>UC Berkeley police arrested four people for not following officers' orders and one for battery on an officer. Three are students of the university, Mogulof said.</p>
      <p>Police said one of the two non-students was wearing a mask.</p>
      <p>A woman in the audience who began yelling during Coulter's Wednesday night speech titled "Adiós, America!" was handcuffed by security and taken out of the event, KPIX-TV reported. It wasn't clear if the woman was one of the five who was arrested.</p>
      <p>A scheduled appearance by Coulter didn't take place in 2017 in the wake of violence before a scheduled talk by another right-wing speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos, when dozens of black-clad anarchists appeared among the crowd and attacked people. They later vandalized businesses near the campus.</p>
      <p>A lawsuit accused the university of discriminating against conservative speakers. UC Berkeley has called the lawsuit's accusation unsubstantiated.</p>
