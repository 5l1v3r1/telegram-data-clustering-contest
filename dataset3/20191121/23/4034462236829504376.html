      <h1>Porsche Taycan Has Much Better Range Than We Thought</h1>
      <h2>You worried, Tesla?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:45:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan-turbo">Porsche Taycan Turbo </a>is the most serious threat to the Tesla Model S to date. Not only does the Taycan look incredible inside and out, it's also a technological force to be reckoned with thanks to its advanced and powerful electric motors and batteries. But how does it fair when it comes to range? You know, the major issue a majority of car buyers are concerned most with.</p>
      <p>A member of the <a href="https://www.taycanevforum.com/threads/carb-certification-for-the-porsche-taycan.1013/">TaycanEVForum.com</a> has posted a copy of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/porsche/taycan">2020 Porsche Taycan'</a>s testing results from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The leaked document reveals that the Taycan Turbo and Turbo S have 281.8 and 282.7 miles of range, respectively.</p>

      <p>To compare, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/audi/e-tron-suv">Audi e-tron</a>'s CARB certification came to 277.55 miles, but its EPA-certified range came to 204 miles. Expect the Porsche Taycan Turbo and Turbo S to earn around a 210-mile range from the EPA. The document also reveals the Turbo's range is about the same as its European WLTP range of 280 miles, but the Turbo S surpasses its WLTP range of 256 miles. CARB's range estimates have a history of exceeding initial estimates and the final figure certified by the EPA.</p>
      <p>For example, CARB certified the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jaguar/i-pace">Jaguar I-Pace</a> with a 334-mile range – 100 more miles than the EPA's 234-mile estimate. A 200-mile or so all-electric driving range is only so-so these days. The <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-s">Tesla Model S</a> Long Range, for example, has an EPA-certified range of 370 miles – the highest of any other electric car so far.</p>

      <p>But we also must remember the Taycan Turbo and Turbo S are the high-performance versions of the Taycan not intended for maximum range. It was either lots of power or greater range; something had to give. Fortunately, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/weve-got-bad-news-about-the-porsche-taycan">era of the Taycan is only beginning</a>.</p>
      <p>Along with the recently revealed entry-level Taycan 4S, expect to see more variants, such as a long-range trim. In the meantime, Porsche Taycan 4S, Turbo, and Turbo S sales are already underway, with pricing beginning at $103,800.</p>
