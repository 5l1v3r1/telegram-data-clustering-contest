        <b>AS a crusty old reporter with a bit of a gut I’ve been teased with the odd jibe of “Who ate all the pies?”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now, I can happily confirm that yes, it was indeed me.</p>

      <p>I’ve honed my taste buds at countless footie matches up and down the country for the best part of three decades.</p>
      <p>And when I’m pie-eyed after a few pints I love nothing more than to tackle a steak bake.</p>
      <p>In fact, I dread to think how much grease has dribbled down my arm over the years — but I reckon it could fill a good-sized Scottish Cup or three.</p>
      <p>To get the chance to become an expert on my favourite subject seemed no more than pie in the sky.</p>
      <p>So I was literally drooling when I was invited to join the seasoned pros judging contenders at the World Championship Scotch Pie Awards.</p>
      <p>But my self-appointed authority quickly turned to mince.</p>

      <p>It was a meaty learning curve that started with a word of caution from my judging team-mate Simon Young, a pie guru who’s been at 19 of the 21 annual competitions run by Scottish Bakers.</p>
      <p>He warned: “This is a serious responsibility — bakers and butchers put a lot of time and effort into it.”</p>
      <p>Words of wisdom from Simon — and our expert team leader — taught me there was more to judging pies than wolfing them down before unleashing a satisfied burp.</p>
      <p>We mulled over a raft of characteristics such as ‘the bake’ and ‘boil out’ as well as shape, texture, taste and the filling-to-pastry ratio.</p>

      <p>Before I knew it, I had set aside my carnivorous instinct of scooping dollops into my mouth and was now carefully wafting each pie’s aroma towards my twitching nostrils with a pretentious pinky stuck out.</p>
      <p>I’m pretty sure it’s a look that would not go down well with your average footie punter.</p>
      <p>But I’m absolutely certain they would give every one of the pies I tasted a resounding seal of approval.</p>
      <p>The identity of the artisans behind the 450 bakery products showcased this week at Carnegie Conference Centre in Dunfermline remains a closely guarded secret.</p>
      <p>The winners will be announced at a glittering awards ceremony in January when guests will tuck into pie, beans and chips served up by last year’s champ, The Little Bakery.</p>
      <p>Alasdair Smith, chief executive of Scottish Bakers, revealed: “The top prize — to be named the World Scotch Pie Champion — is the single most coveted prize among pie-makers across the country.”</p>
      <p>I will happily raise a Scotch pie — or two — to that.</p>
