      <h1>Adam Gilchrist and Justin Langer are Australian legends. Four hours in Hobart set them on the path to greatness</h1>

      <h3>Twenty years ago today Justin Langer and Adam Gilchrist completed one of Australia’s greatest ever comebacks in any sport, the controversy it entailed turning it into one of cricket’s most spoken about encounters.</h3>
      <p>Australia was limping at 5-126 when Adam Gilchrist made his way out to the middle to join an under pressure Justin Langer in Hobart. Taking on an attack that featured both Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, as well as the inventor of the doosra and a man who would go on to bowl the fastest recorded ball in history, the hosts were a world away from their target of 369.</p>

      <p>Gilchrist had already formed a reputation as a seriously destructive batsman across three years of one-day international cricket but as a Test player he was still in the fledgling stages of his career.</p>
      <p>“We knew he was a dangerous player, we never knew he was so dangerous batting at No.7,”</p>
      <p>Pakistani great and captain of the time Wasim Akram told foxsports.com.au. “You get five out and you get into the tail and it was myself, Waqar, Saqlain Mushtaq who got six-for in the game and of course Shoaib Akhtar, one of the fastest bowlers.</p>

      <p>Gilchrist had debuted a Test earlier at the Gabba, inheriting the gloves from the legendary Ian Healy, and impressed with a quick fire 81 off 88. But that had come with Australia in a position of strength; part of a first-innings total of 575. This was something entirely different.</p>
      <p>When he came out to bat, Pakistan thought it was game over. The crowd at Bellerive thought it was over. Almost everybody thought it was over. Almost being the key word.</p>
      <p>“Justin Langer’s first words to me when I got out there were ‘you never know, you never never know’,” Gilchrist recalled to foxsports.com.au.</p>

      <p>With 16 overs to go in the day, the first job was to survive to stumps.</p>
      <p>For Langer, that meant nudging, nurdling and scrapping his way through. For Gilchrist it meant other things. The keeper was one of six men out to Saqlain Mushtaq in the first innings, beguiled by deliveries he’d never faced before.</p>
      <p>“As a batting unit we succumbed to Saqlain Mushtaq,” he said. “I remember he got me out stumped and I had no idea what he was bowling to me.</p>
      <p>“I just tried to play my natural game in the second. In the first innings he deceived me just pushing forward but I just over balanced because I didn’t pick what he was bowling.</p>
      <p>“So I resorted to the sweep and remember hitting him for a couple of boundaries sweeping hard before stumps.”</p>
      <p>He went to stumps on 45 with Langer not far ahead on 52. They’d kept the Test alive for another day but this match was still well and truly in the hands of the tourists.</p>

      <p>“Everyone thought if they took one wicket they would run through us,” Gilchrist recalled.</p>
      <p>They went into final day needing another 181 runs to win with only the bowlers to come taking on the two Ws, Wasim and Waqar, a rapid Shoaib Akhtar and a red hot Mushtaq. Their plan to climb this mountain was a simple one.</p>
      <p>“One of us was looking in 10-run increments and the other was looking at the clock in 10-minute blocks and that was our goal at the end of each over to say ‘how long to go?’ ‘Two more minutes or two more runs’.</p>
      <p>“We’d tick that off and we literally just spoke and verballed that to each other through the whole innings.”</p>

      <p>Sometimes the simple plans are the best. The minutes ticked over and so did the runs as Gilchrist played the kind of power-packed innings he would become synonymous with and Langer showed the grit and determination that defined his career.</p>
      <p>The future Australia coach was a man under the magnifying glass. Prior to Hobart he’d averaged 16 across his past six innings with his place in the side under serious threat. His first innings 59 had alleviated some of the pressure but this was the golden age of Australian domestic cricket and there were plenty of batsmen banging down the door for Test selection.</p>
      <p>Such was the pressure he was under, Langer’s father Colin flew down to Tasmania to support his son during the match.</p>
      <p>Langer had felt hard done by when he was given out in the first innings – a wicket that saw the team slide from 3-206 to 246 all out.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>He was on 76 in the second innings when the Pakistanis thought they’d broken the stand and the back of Australia’s resurgence. Looking to drive Akram, he edged the quick straight into the hands of the keeper with Australia still 137 runs away from victory.</p>
      <p>Only two people in the middle didn’t realise he’d hit it. One was Gilchrist. The other, more</p>
      <p>importantly, was umpire Peter Parker.</p>
      <p>Langer would spend more than a decade sticking by the story that it was a creaky bat handle that had made the noise before coming clean in his autobiography.</p>

      <p>Akram’s reaction to the confession featured a couple of expletive’s. Gilchrist’s – a famous walker – was less animated.</p>
      <p>“At the time I wasn’t sure and I went down and asked him and he said, ‘nah, nothing’. And I went, ‘ah okay, gee they’re carrying on a bit these blokes’,” Gilchrist said. “He had me bluffed.</p>
      <p>“Fair play. He’s not the first bloke to do that (not walk).”</p>
      <p>Pakistan would eventually get that one wicket they had so desperately craved, finally removing Langer for 127. By then Gilchrist had raised a century of his own – he’d beat Langer to it in fact – and</p>
      <p>Australia only needed five more runs to win.</p>

      <p>For Pakistan that missed edge and what it led to proved a series defining moment as they went on to lose the third and final Test by an innings and 20 runs.</p>
      <p>“That edge had a massive impact,” Akram said. “I knew as a captain after that losing that game we were not going to come back in Perth. It was just a matter of time.</p>
      <p>“If we would have won the Hobart Test match we would have gone on to win the third one at the WACA.”</p>
      <p>Twenty years on and Pakistan is still chasing its first ever Test series win in Australia.</p>
      <p>“They were the mighty Australians, these guys were phenomenal,” Akram said. “The batting order, the fielding and they had two of the great bowlers of all time in Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne.</p>
      <p>“No wonder nobody could beat them in Australia.”</p>

      <p>For Gilchrist, that match was the moment he truly knew he belonged at that level.</p>
      <p>“What you want to do is get to the next level, no matter what the next level is. Once you’re there, you want to establish yourself there and justify your position.</p>
      <p>“The first Test in Perth was all about just getting a taste of Test cricket and a feel of it. The second one allowed me the chance to make an impact</p>
      <p>“It gave the team a great deal of confidence and it personally gave me a great deal of confidence too. It was a huge part of my career and launching it.”</p>
      <p>It was the third of 16 straight Test wins for Australia and the precursor for the decade of dominance that was to come.</p>
      <p>“It just created a real sense of unity and a great feeling within the group,” Gilchrist said. “To have such a remarkable win – we just grew in confidence and as I think we felt like we could win from any position from then on.”</p>
      <p>It was also the ninth of 10 straight Test series wins at home for Australia and part of a 25-year run without a Test series loss at home.</p>
