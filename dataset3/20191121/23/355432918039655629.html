      <p>Florida Democrat <a href="https://thehill.com/people/debbie-wasserman-schultz">Debbie Wasserman Schultz</a> on Thursday threw her hat in the ring to become the next chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.<br/><br/>In October, the committee’s current chairwoman Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nita-lowey">Nita Lowey</a> (D-N.Y.), 82, announced that <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/465213-new-york-democrat-nita-lowey-wont-seek-reelection">she would retire</a> at the end of the term, leaving open a race for one of the most coveted gavels in the Congress.<br/><br/>Wasserman Schultz, who chairs the appropriations subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, will face stiff competition.<br/><br/>Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marcy-kaptur">Marcy Kaptur</a> (D-Ohio), the longest-serving female House member, has seniority on the committee, while Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/rosa-delauro">Rosa DeLauro</a> (D-Conn.), an ally of Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a> (D-Calif.) who heads the subcommittee covering the largest non-defense spending bill, has also said she will seek the position.<br/><br/>Wasserman Schultz served as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee in 2016, but stepped aside in the wake of leaked controversial internal e-mails that seemed to indicate plans to sideline Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.), who was running against <a href="https://thehill.com/people/hillary-clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> for the nomination.</p>
