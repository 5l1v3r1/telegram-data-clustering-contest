      <h1>New official gameplay walkthrough video released for MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:57:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:57</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Piranha Games today released new, never-before-seen gameplay in a crash course guided walkthrough for MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries. The battles on display showcase MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries’ expansively destructible environments, designed so that Mechs can tear through structures while swatting helicopters out of the sky and reducing rival pilots’ rides to scrap.</p>
      <p>Briefs on the moments between battles make it clear that with mission recovery, pre-deployment loadouts, and the severity of danger faced all in the hands of players to navigate, MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries’ campaign is all about risk, reward, and consequence.</p>
      <p>MechWarrior 5: Mercenaries marks the return of the series’ mission-focused campaign structure, allowing pilots to call the shots while leading either AI-controlled allies or up to three friends through optional co-op into dangerous contracts. Unit leaders will decide which risky missions to accept, where their priorities lie across the Inner Sphere’s volatile conflict zones, as well as how to best utilize the resources earned from their dances with death.</p>
      <p>The game currently targets a December 10th release on the Epic Games Store.</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
