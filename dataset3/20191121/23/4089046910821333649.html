      <p><b>BOCA RATON, Fla. (Gray News) -</b> Deputies in Palm Beach County said Sandy Hawkins could have walked out of Wells Fargo this week with $2,000, but he settled for less.</p>
      <p>Apparently, $1,100 was plenty for the 73-year-old robbery suspect.</p>
      <p>An arrest report reviewed by <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/20191120/authorities-lsquoyou-gave-me-too-muchrsquo-robber-told-boca-bank-teller">The Palm Beach Post</a> said Hawkins walked into the bank Monday sporting a “Make America Great Again” shirt and asked the teller for $1,100. The teller, in turn, asked Hawkins for his debit card, not realizing Hawkins’ alleged intent to rob the place.</p>
      <p>The teller told deputies Hawkins stuck his hand in his waistband, said he had a weapon and that this was a robbery. Investigators later learned there was no weapon involved.</p>
      <p>Authorities said the teller handed Hawkins $2,000, but Hawkins rejected it because he only wanted the specified amount.</p>
      <p>The teller said he counted out 11 $100 bills and gave it to Hawkins, who then left.</p>
      <p>The next day, investigators reviewed footage from the bank’s security cameras. They took images to the surrounding businesses, hoping that someone could identify the suspect.</p>
      <p>They caught a bit of luck when they got to Turn 3, a sports bar in the same shopping strip as the bank. The bar’s manager identified the suspect as Sandy Hawkins, who had reportedly become a regular patron at the establishment.</p>
      <p>The manager’s father directed law enforcement to Hawkins’ home, not far from the strip mall. Half an hour later, they were knocking on his door.</p>
      <p>Deputies said Hawkins told them he’d “make this easy.” They said he pulled out a wrinkled-up deposit slip with a handwritten message on the back: “Give me $1,100 now. No alarms. Hope to get caught.”</p>
