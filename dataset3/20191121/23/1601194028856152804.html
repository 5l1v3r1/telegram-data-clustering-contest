      <p>Roberto Bautista Agut has withdrawn from Spain's Davis Cup team following the death of his father on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Bautista Agut had played two singles matches for Spain at this week's tournament in Madrid, losing to Andrey Rublev on Tuesday before defeating Croatia's Nikola Mektic on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>However, Spain will be without the 29-year-old – who is their number two player behind world number one Rafael Nadal – for the rest of the competition.</p>
      <p>"We want to accompany Roberto in these hard times. He is an exceptional tennis player who symbolises the highest values ​​of tennis and sports," Royal Spanish Tennis Federation​ (RFET) president Miguel Diaz said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"He is an example, not only as an athlete, but also as a person. I want to transfer in my name all the support of Spanish tennis."</p>
      <p>Five-time Davis Cup champions Spain face Argentina in the quarter-finals on Friday.</p>
