      <p>HP on Sunday rejected Xerox’s offer of $22 per share, saying it undervalued the company, and that it was open to exploring its own bid for the U.S. printer maker.</p>
      <p>“We are confused by this reasoning in that your own financial adviser, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, set a $14 price target with a ‘sell’ rating for HP’s stock after you announced your restructuring plan,” Xerox wrote in its letter to HP.</p>
      <p>The median price target on HP stock by 15 analysts is $20.</p>
      <p>HP did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.</p>
      <p>“Unless you and we agree on mutual confirmatory due diligence to support a friendly combination by Nov. 25, Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders,” the company said in the letter.</p>
      <p>HP said on Sunday that, under Xerox’s proposed terms, the combined company would be saddled with “outsized debt”.</p>
      <p>However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, and said it can evaluate the merits by accessing diligence information on Xerox.</p>
      <p>Xerox on Thursday said it has accepted HP’s request for due diligence, but that HP had refused to open its books to Xerox.</p>
      <p>“Any friendly process for a combination of this type requires mutual diligence - your proposal for one-way diligence is an unnecessary delay tactic,” Xerox wrote.</p>
      <p>Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.</p>
      <p>“Xerox’s move could force HP to propose a higher acquisition price that would benefit HP shareholders, or potentially turn the tables and have HP look to acquire Xerox,” Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said.</p>
      <p>Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox’s board last year with fellow businessman Darwin Deason, told the Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has a 4% stake in HP.</p>
      <p>Xerox made the offer to HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/4901.T">4901.T</a>) that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.</p>
