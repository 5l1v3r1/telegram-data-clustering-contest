      <p>George Kittle and Evan Engram both are close to making their returns to the top of our TE rankings, but it might not happen in Week 12. Further down the tight end ranks, we're keeping an eye on the health of David Njoku and Delanie Walker as possible fantasy starters. We have the latest injuryupdates below on those four big names from a weak fantasy position.</p>

      <h3>George Kittle injury update</h3>
      <p>Kittle (knee) <a href="https://twitter.com/CamInman/status/1197251143501402113">missed Wednesday's practice</a> and has yet to practice since the end of October. He hasn't played since initially suffering the injury duringWeek 9's game against Arizona. Kyle Shanahan suggested that Kittle's status will come down to gameday. The 49ers don't kick off until Sunday night against the Packers.</p>
      <p>Ross Dwelley should be owned in most fantasy leagues in what is a top-five fantasy TE matchup, and if you're a Kittle owner and Dwelley is out there, go get him. Dwelley is a top-10 fantasy play at the position this week if Kittle is out. You're obviously starting Kittle if he plays.</p>

      <h3>Even Engram injury news</h3>
      <p>Engram (foot) missed the Giants' practice Wednesday, and <a href="https://twitter.com/JordanRaanan/status/1197185057938694144?s=20">ESPN's Jordan Raanan</a> thinks it'd be an "upset" if Engram played this weekend. Engram hasn't played since Week 9. The Giants kick off at 1 p.m. ET Sunday in Chicago.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: Engram missed practice again Thursday.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Rhett Ellison is dealing with a concussion and missed Wednesday's practice, too. Kaden Smith would start at TE for the Giants if both were out, but he wouldn't be worth using in fantasy. Daniel Jones would get a boost if Engram was able to play.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Will David Njoku play Week 12?</h3>
      <p>Njoku was officially designated to return from Injured Reserve and was on the practice field for the Browns on Wednesday without limitations. Cleveland probably wouldn't officially activate Njoku before this weekend when it plays Miami at home.</p>
      <p>The matchup would be great for Njoku if it looks like he'd be active and play without limitations. He's a borderline fantasy starter the rest of the way whenever he makes it back to the field.</p>
      <p>

      <h3>When will Delanie Walker return?</h3>
      <p>Walker was back at Titans' practice Wednesday and <a href="https://twitter.com/TDavenport_NFL/status/1197243265982124032">told reporters</a> he's feeling "excited." Walker also is without the knee brace that he was wearing earlier in the week. Tennessee plays at 4:05 p.m. ET Sunday against Jacksonville.</p>
      <p>
        <i>(Update: Walker practiced again Thursday.)</i>
      </p>
      <p>Walker's return, at least for a week, will make both he and Jonnu Smith basically unplayable while we wait to see who emerges as the top tight end for the Titans. After that's determined, either is a borderline fantasy starter in 12-team leagues, as long as they don't cannabalize each other too much.</p>
