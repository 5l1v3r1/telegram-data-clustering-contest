      <h1>Telstra’s Cut The Price Of Its iPad Plan If You Need Another Screen In Your Life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:43:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:43</time> by <a rel="author">By Alex Choros</a></address>
      <p>Christmas is right around the corner, and let’s be real, the best gift you get is often the one you give yourself. After all, no one knows you quite like you. If you’re keen to get a head start on treating yourself, Telstra is here to help.</p>
      <p>Big T has cut the price on iPad plans, meaning you can save $216 on Apple’s seventh-generation tablet. That’s a $9 per month discount on a 24-month repayment. This actually brings down the price of a 4G iPad to less than what you’d pay for a Wi-Fi-only model outright, regardless of whether you’re looking at the 32GB or 128GB configuration.</p>
      <p>Of course, you’ll have to add on a data plan too. These start at $15 per month for 5GB, so you’re looking at a minimum of $36.38 per month for a 32GB iPad. That’s pretty much identical to what you’d pay on Optus for a similar deal, but all Telstra tablet plans have no excess charges. This means you’ll still be able to keep using your service if you burn through your allowance, albeit with slower speeds. </p>
      <p>In addition, Telstra will also knock $10 off your bill for the first six months if you sign up before November 24. Weirdly, the discounted iPad promo runs until November 26 – two days longer. </p>
      <p>You can check out Telstra’s 24-month 32GB iPad plans below: </p>

      <p>The seventh-generation iPad is Apple’s new entry-level tablet, touting a bigger display and support for its Smart Keyboard accessory. </p>
