      </p>
      <p>The Siya crew reported in this week’s issue of Soccer Laduma that Sundra Govinder, Chiefs’ Head of Development, was on the verge of an exit from Naturena as he ponders the next step in his career.</p>
      <p>Govinder has been vital as the likes of Happy Mashiane, Siphosakhe Ntiya-Ntiya, Siyabonga Ngezana, Njabulo Blom and others moved through the youth ranks and into the Amakhosi senior ranks, but the club has now confirmed that he will leave at the end of this month.</p>
      <p>A statement on the club’s official website read, “Sundra Govinder has resigned from his post as Head of Development at the Club. He joined Kaizer Chiefs as Youth Development coach in 2016 and in 2018 he became Head of Development.</p>
      <p>“During his term of office Sundra worked with Chiefs’ Under 13, 15, 17 and 19 squads… Govinder will vacate his position at the end of November 2019.”</p>
