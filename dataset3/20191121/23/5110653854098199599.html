      <h1>Fantasy Injury Updates: Is T.Y. Hilton playing Thursday night? (Updated)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:53:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:53</time> by <a rel="author">Billy Heyen</a></address>
      <p>T.Y. Hilton is listed as questionableon the Colts' official injury report heading into Thursday Night Football against the Texans. Hilton has missed the past three games for Indianapolis while dealing with a calf injury. Hilton's potential return would knock the fantasy value of Zach Pascal and Marcus Johnson down further. The official active/inactive report will come out at about 6:50 p.m. ET. We'll have updates here and on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/sn_fantasy">@SN_Fantasy</a> through that time.</p>

      <h3>Is T.Y. Hilton playing Thursday night?</h3>
      <p><b>UPDATE 2: </b>Hilton is officially ACTVE.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE 1: </b>Hilton "believes he's good to go," <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesPalmerTV/status/1197595337772478467?s=20">according to NFL Network's James Palmer</a>.</p>
      <p>Hilton has missed the Colts' last three games due to a calf injury. He didn't participate in practice at any level on Monday or Tuesday. Hilton <a href="https://twitter.com/gmbremer/status/1196850898347184128">told reporters</a> Tuesday that he will play if "all the boxes are checked off." You'd imagine one of those boxes would be making it onto the practice field. Hilton was a full participant Wednesday, although the Colts didn't hold a full practice.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In Hilton's absence, Zach Pascal has been unproductive as the Colts' top receiver but is playable as a WR3 against the Texans' porous pass defense. In deeper leagues, you possibly can rely on Marcus Johnson if Hilton is out. Johnson has been starting on the outside opposite Pascal and caught all four of his Week 11 targets. Chester Rogers has fallen out of favor in the Indy passing game and is only their third most-used wideout the last couple weeks.</p>

      </p>
      <p>If Hilton plays, you have to move him into your fantasy starting lineup, although there could still be some worry about aggravating the calf injury. An active Hilton makes Pascal and Johnson both too unreliable in all but the deepest of fantasy leagues.</p>
