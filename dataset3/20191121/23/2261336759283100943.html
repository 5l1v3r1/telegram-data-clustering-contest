      <h1>Sara McMann vs. Lina Lansberg slated for UFC Raleigh</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mookie Alexander</a></address>
      <p>Sara McMann is in an arguable must-win situation entering her next fight, and the UFC has booked her against an opponent who’s currently on a two-fight win streak.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/UFCEurope/status/1197243214379409408">In an official announcement made on Wednesday</a>, the former women’s bantamweight title challenger is headed for a showdown with Lina Lansberg at UFC Raleigh on January 25th. It’s a virtual home fight for McMann, who wrestled in the state of North Carolina while in high school.</p>
      <p>McMann (11-5) is an Olympic silver medalist in freestyle wrestling, making her UFC debut in 2013. After stopping Sheila Gaff, McMann took on Ronda Rousey for the 135 lbs title, but lost by TKO. It has been an inconsistent run for McMann ever since that defeat, with a record of just 4-4 in her last eight bouts. Her previous two appearances saw her choked out by Ketlen Vieira and Marion Reneau. The 39-year-old’s last win came versus Gina Mazany in 2017.</p>
      <p>Lansberg (10-4) debuted in the UFC against Cris Cyborg, unsurprisingly losing by second-round TKO. “Elbow Queen” alternated wins and losses over her next four bouts, but has come on strongly in recent successful showings against Tonya Evinger and Macy Chiasson. Her unanimous decision over Chiasson marked Macy’s first defeat, in what was considered a significant upset.</p>
      <p>UFC Raleigh’s main event is expected to be a heavyweight matchup between former champion Junior dos Santos and Curtis Blaydes, while former lightweight champ Frankie Edgar heads to bantamweight to face rising contender Cory Sandhagen in the co-main event.</p>
