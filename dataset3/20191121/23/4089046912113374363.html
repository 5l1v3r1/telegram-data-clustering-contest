      <p>Eight year old Addie Bennett is battling leukemia.</p>
      <p>"It's been horrible," said Addie.</p>
      <p>Addie has no extended family in East Tennessee, but her classmates at First Baptist Academy want her to know she is not fighting alone.</p>
      <p>"We're a family here so we stand behind her," explained her second grade teacher Kasey Mathis. "We write cards all the time."</p>
      <p>Her pastor is also a teacher at her school and he helped get J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, to write her a letter and send her a book.</p>
      <p>"I wish with everything our class has done, the school has done, I wish that we could say that we're the hero in this story, but Addie's been a great encouragement to us," said Adam Holland, Addie's pastor.</p>
      <p>"It's been overwhelming and humbling," said Sarah Bennett, Addie's mom.</p>
      <p>Addie said her classmates make her feel happy.</p>
      <p>They even raised money to buy her an iPad and sent her a basked filled with arts and crafts.</p>
      <p>"Every single day there's some sort of form of love and support," said Sarah Bennett.</p>
      <p>Depending on how her body reacts to this round of chemotherapy she may have to go to Nashville for a bone marrow stem cell transplant. Thankfully she has an older brother who is a match.</p>
      <p>Now, the hope is Addie will be cancer free in the next two years.</p>
