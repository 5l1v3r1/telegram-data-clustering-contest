      <p>Mauricio Pochettino appeared to leave a thank you message to his players after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/inside-story-mauricio-pochettinos-tottenham-downfall-amazon/">being sacked as Tottenham manager</a>.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, who led Spurs to the Champions League final last season, was sacked after five years in charge of the club on Tuesday and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/21/jose-mourinho-admits-has-learned-past-mistakes-says-spurs-can/">promptly replaced by Jose Mourinho</a>.</p>
      <p>While Pochettino has yet to make an official statement following his sacking, the message to his former players is understood to represent a breaking of silence from the Argentine, albeit behind closed doors.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's assistant Jesus Perez has posted a picture of the 47-year-old writing on a tactics board what seems to be a heartfelt note to his squad as he prepared to leave the club.</p>
      <p>A picture of the board revealed a message reading: "Big thanks to you all! We can't to (sic) say goodbye... you will always be in our [heart symbol]."</p>

      <p>After sacking Pochettino on Tuesday night, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy, said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board have taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and the beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>"It falls on the board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff <b>– </b>but we do so in the club's best interests."</p>
