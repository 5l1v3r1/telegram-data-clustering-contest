      <p>Some people may argue that <a href="https://www.amarillo.com/zz/entertainmentlife/20191121/15-thanksgiving-side-dishes-definitively-ranked">green bean casserole isn’t the best Thanksgiving side dish</a>, and those people are wrong (although if you argue that dressing/stuffing/whatever you call it where you live is the best dish, I’ll allow it, because you’re also correct. GBC and dressing only, thanks).</p>
      <p>To celebrate the world’s best type of casserole, food brand Green Giant created the world’s largest green bean casserole, clocking in at a whopping 1,009 pounds to beat the world record.</p>
      <p>They used an estimated 125,000 green beans in the casserole, totaling 1,069 cans. They also used 485 cans of mushroom soup, 65 quarts of milk and 95 pounds of fried onions (I don’t know about you, but I could eat 95 pounds of fried onions).</p>
      <p>The previous record-holding casserole was also created by Green Giant and weighed in at just 637 pounds.</p>
