        <b>Michael Douglas revealed his father begged him not to throw him a huge party for his 103rd birthday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kirk Douglas was thrown lavish parties for every birthday but is desperate for a normal dinner with the family.</p>
      <p>Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel, Michael said: ‘Well, it’s like, so 100. Okay, so he was 100. Big birthday, big birthday. The trouble is, when you’re 100, you don’t really want a big birthday.</p>
      <p>‘I threw a big party for him, it was great. 101. You know, “Okay, let’s have a nice party.” “Again? I don’t …” “Dad, it’s 101 years old. You have to have a birthday.” Okay … 102 …</p>
      <p>‘So now he’s begging me, he’s got tears down his eyes,’ the 75-year-old continued. ‘Let’s just have dinner, the family together. Bring the kids.’</p>
      <p>You heard the man, Michael. Bring the kids with you to a peaceful dinner.</p>

      <p>Cameron recently admitted his life ‘spiralled out of control’ when he was told his father Michael was cheating on his mother Diandra.</p>
      <p>The actor confessed that it was the beginning of his drug addiction, with him going on to deal crystal meth (which he disguised as bath salts).</p>
      <p>Cameron recalled that, when he was sent to boarding school as a young teen, he tried marijuana and ‘felt the pressure lift’ as well as seeing it as a ‘path out of his loneliness.’</p>
      <p>He later got kicked out of school for his drug use and said that he was so desperate to get high at one point that he’d shoot cocaine into his neck and ribcage.</p>
      <p>Fatal Attraction actor Michael admitted in the ABC special: ‘My career was first. My career came before my family. My marriage was not great.</p>
      <p>‘I should’ve focused more on my family but that’s hard to say when you’re in the midst of a career, when in your own mind you’re stepping out of your father’s shadow, trying to create a life of your own.’</p>
