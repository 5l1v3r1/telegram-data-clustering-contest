        <b>LABOUR were in turmoil in Scotland before today’s manifesto launch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If anything, they’re now in even deeper trouble. Jeremy Corbyn’s manifesto rabbit, it turned out, was an £11billion raid on the North Sea oil sector.</p>

      <p>The timing of this insane, short-sighted cash grab could not be more idiotic.</p>
      <p>The struggling industry is still on its knees following the slump that started in 2014 and ravaged jobs and the north-east economy in the years that followed.</p>
      <p>More than 100,000 livelihoods were lost then, at a conservative estimate.</p>
      <p>And now the sector is just about picking itself back up, in part thanks to tax cuts and investment from the UK and Scottish Governments to encourage innovation and exploration.</p>
      <p>Getting firms to invest — and not simply cut their losses and flee — has been hard enough in recent years.</p>
      <p>This windfall tax will only make things worse.</p>
      <p>And it risks the recovery that’s needed to put firms in a financially sound place, necessary for the decades of decommissioning that will follow the industry’s inevitable decline.</p>
      <p>As Aberdeen University’s Professor Alex Kemp points out, the policy is also based on a mistaken belief that firms should have been taxed harder historically in line with countries like Norway.</p>
      <p>This is comparing apples and pears, with taxes lower in the UK basin because the oil has been, generally, more expensive to extract in our waters than in Scandinavia.</p>
      <p>It’s this kind of schoolboy error — or fundamental misunderstanding of reality — that has become a hallmark of Corbynomics.</p>
      <p>Just like his pledges to boost public spending, while splurging billions on misguided nationalisations.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t add up.</p>
      <p>But you have to wonder if Mr Corbyn knows this — and simply wants to virtue signal and pursue his wrecking-ball ideology.</p>
      <p>Because there appears to be a warping of reality with Labour.</p>
      <p>Take their pledge for free school dinners in Scotland. It may sound nice, but education is devolved.</p>
      <p>People have enough trouble understanding the complex political landscape without red herrings like this.</p>
      <p>It’s no wonder polls show no sign of budging in Mr Corbyn’s favour.</p>
      <p>He’s detached from reality.</p>
      <p>
        <b>And this manifesto isn’t going to change his woes.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Rogue Royals</h3>
      <p>
        <b>EVEN at 93 the Queen has acted decisively.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But Andrew is not the only Prince doing her damage.</p>
      <p>She is right to <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4982161/her-majesty-has-warned-prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-not-to-step-out-of-line/">warn Harry and Meghan</a> too.</p>
      <p>She should demand they keep out of politics, cease the “woke” lectures and needy self-pity — and buckle down to some Royal duties.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Or they can sling their hook too.</b>
