      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277505-kogi-election-inec-executed-apcs-grand-plan-impose-yahaya-bello-people---umar-sani.html">Umar Sani, a former presidential aide</a>, has described the Saturday, November 16, governorship election in Kogi state as an electoral banditry and robbery.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an exclusive chat with Legit.ng, Sani said the chairman of Independent national Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu, only executed the assignment given to him by the federal government to return Yahaya Bello as the governor of Kogi state.</p>
      <p>He wondered why the late former governor of the state, Abubakar Audu, with his political influence and acceptance by people could not defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) with the bogus margin INEC released as the difference between Bello and Musa Wada during the election.</p>
