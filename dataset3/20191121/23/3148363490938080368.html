      <p>As Trump began speaking, Voight began to dance on the stage while the<i> Midnight Cowboy</i> theme played on the loudspeaker.</p>
      <p>Trump was clearly surprised by the move but grinned as Voight continued his performance.</p>
      <p>“I want to hear that whole song, but I don’t know Jon, maybe we have to get it moving a little bit,” Trump said, calling Voight “one of the greatest living legends in cinema.”</p>

      <p>Trump recalled Voight’s roles in<i> Midnight Cowboy, Coming Home, Mission Impossible, National Treasure</i> and the film <i>The Champ</i>, which he called the “the greatest boxing movie all time.”</p>
      <p>“That was some great movie,” Trump recalled. “Everyone was crying at that movie. I tried not to John, but it wasn’t easy.”</p>
      <p>President Trump praised Voight as an actor of “astonishing range and depth,” recalling his performances in <i>Deliverance, The Odessa Files</i>, playing Franklin Delano Rosevelt in <i>Pearl Harbor,</i> and a role in the movie <i>Ali.</i></p>
      <p>“John captures the imagination of the audiences and dominates almost every single scene he’s in,” Trump said. “He’s a special person.”</p>
