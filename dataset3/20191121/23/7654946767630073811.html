      <h1>Raccoon-related subway delays nearly doubled this year: MTA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:27:20+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:27</time> by <a rel="author">Natalie O'Neill and David Meyer</a></address>
      <p>The MTA’s newest headache might be its cutest!</p>
      <p>Raccoons have been busted ruining straphangers commutes nearly a dozen times this year — more than twice as often as last year, MTA records show.</p>
      <p>Officials report 11 raccoon-related disruptions so far this year, more than double the five in all of 2018.</p>
      <p>The A, L and Q lines — which run through some of the most suburban parts of the city — were hardest hit, sources told The City.</p>
      <p>Photos taken last night show one of the masked marauders managed to make its way onto the platform at Brooklyn’s Nevins Street station.</p>
      <p>“yo there’s a whole ass raccoon at the platform Brooklyn bound at Nevins St. can you help him?” Straphanger @oswaldthehedgie tweeted at the MTA, <a href="https://twitter.com/oswaldthehedgie/status/1197349739966144512">along with a photo</a> of the pesky animal.</p>
      <p>Service was not disrupted, MTA officials told The Post — but straphangers at Nevins have not always been so lucky.</p>
      <p>The critters struck twice on Nov. 2, first to delaying southbound trains at the station at 10:51 p.m. — and 56 minutes later, they disrupted the northbound IRT service.</p>
      <p>“He popped back up, and from what we’re hearing he managed to escape again,” the @NYCTSubway account <a href="https://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/1190839848439074817">posted on Twitter</a> at 11:55 p.m. Trains were back in service ten minutes later.</p>
      <p>And just this Saturday night, one of the four-legged culprits delayed L trains after a Canarsie-bound train struck it near the Broadway Junction station.</p>
      <p>The potentially-rabid critters aren’t the only mammals delaying trains, according to MTA data.</p>
      <p>Opossums have caused nine delays, while cats caused seven, birds were linked to four — and even one was chalked up to a turkey.</p>
