      <h3>Mourinho eyes Ibrahimovic reunion at Spurs</h3>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's seat in the Tottenham dugout has barely gone cold, but new Spurs' boss Jose Mourinho is already being linked with an attempt to hijack AC Milan's move for experienced forward <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/11001/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic">Zlatan Ibrahimovic</a></b>, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10365143/arsenal-news-live-pepe-torreira-haaland-transfer/">according to the Guardian</a>.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old previously brought Ibrahimovic to the Premier League whilst managing Manchester United, with the towering Swede finding the back of the net 26 times in just 46 appearances at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Spurs are still without cover for talisman <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/142200/Harry-Kane">Harry Kane</a> having failed to replace <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/46912/Fernando-Llorente">Fernando Llorente</a> following his departure to Serie A side Napoli.</p>
      <p>According to Italian sources, Milan's pursuit of Ibrahimovic has hit a snag with the 38-year-old's wage demands likely to be a problem, and Mourinho is now keen to capitalise as he looks to bolster his attacking options.</p>
      <h3>Crystal Palace could swoop in for Giroud</h3>
      <p>Crystal Palace are keen to sign Chelsea and France centre-forward <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/88965/Olivier-Giroud">Olivier Giroud</a> </b>in an ambitious swoop, but the striker's significant wage demands could thwart any potential deal, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1207636/Chelsea-transfer-news-Olivier-Giroud-Inter-Milan-Crystal-Palace-Premier-League">the Daily Express are reporting</a>.</p>
      <p>Former Arsenal forward Giroud is desperate to leave Stamford Bridge having made just two starts all season, and the 33-year-old has been strongly linked with a move to Inter Milan, with Borussia Dortmund also believed to be interested.</p>
      <p>However, according to the Express, Giroud's hefty demands of £7 million-per-season could price the striker out of any move away from West London, with Chelsea also likely to demand a fee of £5m, meaning any potential buyer will have to spend big to strike a deal.</p>
      <p>If that proves to be the case Palace will likely turn their attention to Celtic's 21-year-old sensation, <b>Odsonne Eduard</b>, who has struck 13 times in 24 appearances this so far campaign.</p>
      <h3>Tap-ins</h3>
      <p>- Premier League side Wolves and Italian giants Inter Milan have joined the pack of clubs chasing highly-rated Parma loanee <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/272695/Dejan-Kulusevski">Dejan Kulusevski</a></b>, according to Calciomercato. The Atalanta man has previously been linked with Manchester United, Arsenal and Southampton following a string of impressive displays this season.</p>
      <p>- Leicester City are interested in signing defender <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/208285/Robin-Koch">Robin Koch</a> </b>from high-flying Bundesliga side SC Freiburg, <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10394414/leicester-transfer-kock-maguire-rodgers/">according to the Sun</a>. Foxes' boss Brendan Rodgers sent scouts to monitor the 23-year old during the international break, but faces competition from Wolves and Norwich to land the man who he sees at <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/157073/Harry-Maguire">Harry Maguire</a>'s long-term successor.</p>
      <p>- <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/barcelona-weigh-up-offers-for-todibo-as-leverkusen-eye/dab1ig5yndrw1lqppkzpij5ao">According to Goal</a>, Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen are interested in signing Barcelona defender <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/277327/Jean-Clair-Todibo">Jean-Clair Todibo</a> </b>either on loan or in a permanent deal, with the Spanish giants said to be considering their options. The youngster only moved to Camp Nou from Toulouse in January, but is believed to be frustrated at his lack of playing time.</p>
