      <h1>Israel’s Chief Rabbis, Hundreds More, Thank Trump for US Foreign Policy Decisions on Israel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:04:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>A group of 250 rabbis in Israel signed and sent a letter to US President Donald Trump this week, expressing their congratulations and thanks for his foreign policy decisions regarding the State of Israel.</p>
      <p>The letter was sent immediately following the most recent statement by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, declaring that the United States does not consider the establishment and existence of Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria to be in conflict with international law.</p>
      <p>The letter, written and signed by Tzfat Chief Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu, was signed by the Chief Rabbis of Israel, Rabbi David Lau and Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, as well as senior rabbis such as Rabbi Chaim Druckman, Rabbi Shlomo Aviner, Rabbi Yaakov Shapira and others.</p>
      <p>
        <i>The text of the letter follows:</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mr. Donald Trump, President of the United States<br/>The White House, Washington D.C.<br/>USA</p>
      <p>Dear Mr. President,</p>
      <p>More than 2500 years ago, the prophet Jeremiah had a vision: “You will yet plant vineyards in the Samarian Hills.” On the hilltops of Judea, Jeremiah said: “ They shall again say this in the land of Judah and in its towns, when I restore their fortunes: ‘The Lord bless you, Abode of righteousness, O holy mountain!”</p>
      <p>We have been blessed with the merit of living in a generation in which these prophecies, and all the biblical prophecies, are coming to fruition one after another. Some 130 years ago, Jews from all around the world began to return to the Land of Israel. 72 years ago we shook off the yoke of foreign rule. 52 years ago we returned to Jerusalem, to Hebron, and to the other cities of Samaria and Judea.</p>
      <p>Our enemies do not rest; they continue to do everything in their power to stop this process. But God promised our forefather Abraham, “…your children will inherit the gates of their enemies,” and we have seen with our own eyes the fulfillment, through us, of God’s promise: “And fifty of you shall vanquish a hundred, and a hundred of you shall vanquish a thousand, and your enemies will fall before your sword.”</p>
      <p>We rejoice most of all in the blessings of peace: The land of Israel bears bountiful fruit; Israel’s economy grows more robust with every passing day; the nations of the world have begun to recognize Israel’s mission to bring blessings to the entire world – to bring faith, to strengthen justice, and to bring peace. Two years ago, we merited recognition, granted by you and by the United States of America, of the centrality of Jerusalem, and now we have merited recognition of the legality of Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria.</p>
      <p>The United States of America has had the merit of being the first to support the establishment of the modern State of Israel. The presidents of the United States have had the merit of standing at Israel’s side, of partnering in the realization of the prophetic vision of the Return to Zion and the rebirth of Israel. A rare privilege has now presented itself to you: To be the first American president to blaze the trail for recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, and now, over the Jewish communities of Judea and Samaria.</p>
      <p>The God of Israel promised that He would bless all those who bless Abraham. To the Prophet Isaiah, God promised that He will not rest until all the nations of the world recognize the righteousness of Israel, and the righteousness of your decisions will be a source of His blessings for you. “For the sake of Zion I will not be silent, for the sake of Jerusalem I will not be still, until her victory emerges resplendent and her triumph burns like a flaming torch. Nations shall see your victory, and every king your majesty; and you shall be called by a new name which the Lord Himself shall bestow.”</p>
      <p>How fortunate are you to have this tremendous merit.<br/>We are certain that you will go down in the history of the Jewish People for all eternity as the man who stood on the front lines, unafraid. May the promise made by God to Joshua be fulfilled in you: “I charge you: Be strong and resolute; do not be terrified or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
