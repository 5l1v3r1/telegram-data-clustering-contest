      <p>(CNN) — President Donald Trump is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/31/politics/trump-florida-resident/index.html">officially a Florida man</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump and First Lady Melania Trump registered to vote in Florida, making Mar-a-Lago their new primary residence on October 30, according to Florida’s voter registration file. The Trumps’ registration update was first reported by <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/311527-donald-melania-trump-florida-voters">FloridaPolitics.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Trump could well use his newly minted voter registration status as motivation for other Floridians to get out and vote, too: He’s holding a campaign rally in south Florida that <a href="https://floridapolitics.com/archives/311541-trumps-south-florida-rally-voter-registration">will double as a voter registration drive</a> on November 26.</p>
      <p>Trump announced this fall he would make Florida his primary residence — instead of New York’s Trump Tower — ahead of the 2020 election.</p>
      <p>“I will be making Palm Beach, Florida, our Permanent Residence,” Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190079191355670529">tweeted</a> on October 31. “I have been treated very badly by the political leaders of both the city and state. Few have been treated worse.”</p>
