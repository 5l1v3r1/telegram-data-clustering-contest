      <h1>John Legend On ‘Baby, It’s Cold Outside’ Backlash: ‘People Make New Versions Of Songs All The Time’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T23:45:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Shakiel Mahjouri</a></address>
      <p>John Legend says there should be no controversy surrounding <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/531100/john-legend-announces-a-legendary-christmas-the-deluxe-edition-album/">his updated version of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”</a> with Kelly Clarkson.</p>
      <p>Legend and Clarkson recently covered the song and altered some lyrics. The song’s original lyrics sparked some concern last year over what some perceived to be outdated and inappropriate. That stance is a topic of much debate, but it resulted in some radio stations banning “Baby, It’s Cold Outside”.</p>

      <p>Although the new rendition likely appeased those who were unsatisfied with the original, it did irk those who believed the outrage was unwarranted.</p>
      <p>“First of all, there’s no side to be on,” Legend told <i><a href="https://people.com/music/john-legend-addresses-baby-its-cold-outside-controversy/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=peoplemagazine&amp;xid=socialflow_twitter_peoplemag">People</a> </i>at Sirius XM’s Dial Up the Moment campaign. “It’s just another version of the song. If you don’t wanna listen to it, you don’t have to. No one’s saying you can’t listen to the old version. Those versions all exist. People make new versions of songs all the time and we thought it’d be fun to update the song and make it more current.”</p>

      <p>“We wanted a comedic angle to it so I asked Natasha Rothwell from ‘Insecure’ to be my co-writer on it,” he added. “She came up with so many funny ideas and we used so much of it and made a brand new version, one that’s kind of updated for now. And we had a lot of fun making it.”</p>
      <p>Chrissy Teigen recently defended Legend and Clarkson’s cover, <a href="https://etcanada.com/news/543476/chrissy-teigen-tells-sharon-osbourne-to-get-over-john-legends-baby-its-cold-outside-remake/">throwing shade at critic Sharon Osbourne</a> in the process.</p>
