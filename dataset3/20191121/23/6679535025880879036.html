      <p>Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday held a telephone conversation with U.S. President Donald Trump and discussed with him bilateral and regional matters, including the Afghan peace process and the Kashmir issue, his office said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Khan conveyed that the release of Western hostages in Afghanistan was a positive development and Pakistan was happy that they were safe and free, the Prime Minister Office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“President Trump thanked the prime minister for Pakistan’s efforts in facilitating this positive outcome,” according to the statement.</p>
      <p>Mr. Khan re-affirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the advancement of the Afghan peace and reconciliation process for a peaceful and stable Afghanistan. Both leaders agreed to continue to work together for the promotion of this shared objective.</p>
      <p>The Afghan Taliban released two Western hostages in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday, handing them over to US forces more than three years after they were abducted in Kabul</p>
      <p>The Pakistan PM also apprised Mr. Trump of the current situation in Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Tension between India and Pakistan escalated after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5. Reacting to India’s move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.</p>
      <p>Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue but India has asserted that the abrogation of Article 370 was its “internal matter“.</p>
      <p>Recalling their conversations in Washington and New York, the two leaders agreed to deepen bilateral collaboration, including in relevant multilateral fora.</p>
      <p>The two leaders further agreed to remain in close contact.</p>
