      <p>The issue features the first appearances of characters such as the Human Torch, Ka-Zar, Angel and the Sub-Mariner.</p>
      <p>Heritage says the comic book was first purchased at a newsstand by a Uniontown, Pennsylvania, mail carrier who made a practice of buying the first issue of comic books and magazines.</p>
      <p>Mr Jaster says that since then, the issue has only changed owners a handful of times.</p>
