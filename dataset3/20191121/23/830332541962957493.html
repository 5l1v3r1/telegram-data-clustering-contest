      <p>Potter said "my eligibility waiver was denied again today and sadly, we now have closure. I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated we've reached this point. I'm still confused why I am being punished for behaving in a manner hat the NCAA requests of its student athletes."</p>
      <p>Potter added, "for the next month, my goal continues to be what it has been, of doing everything possible to prepare my teammates for upcoming games and supporting them from the sidelines."</p>
