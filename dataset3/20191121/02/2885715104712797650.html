      <h1>Aishwarya Walvekar, a student at JNU, on her new play, Death of an Anti-National</h1>
      <h2>The first show, which took place at Sudarshan Rangmanch in Pune recently, was raw and had the quality of an emotional outburst.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:49:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/dipanita-nath/" target="_blank">Dipanita Nath</a></address>
      <p>Every time Aishwarya Walvekar spoke her mind, she used to be called a rebel or a feminist. It stopped when she enrolled in the School of Art and Aesthetics at <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/jawaharlal-nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> University in Delhi in 2016, shortly after Kanhaiya Kumar was arrested. “Suddenly, I was being labelled an urban naxal.</p>
      <p>When I was packing my bags, my friends said, ‘Why are you going to that anti-national university?’,” she says. Over the next few months, Pune-based Walvekar got into bitter arguments with friends and family, and even fell out with a few of them. Now, she brings dissent to the stage with Death of an Anti-National, a solo play she has co-directed with Sourabh Zunjar.</p>
      <p>Walvekar begins performing in a long shirt and sari but sheds down to a pastel body suit because, she announces, “I don’t need these layers.” The rest of the hour-long performance is a soliloquy interspersed with projections of almost every piece of news that has divided the nation over the last years — from the assassinations of Narendra Dhabolkar and Govind Pansare, to <a href="https://www.indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-article-370-has-not-been-scrapped-but-kashmirs-special-status-has-gone-5880390/">Article 370</a> and Abhinandan’s capture in Pakistan. “I am a student of JNU, hence proven that I am anti-national. And you are all deshbhakt,” Walvekar says to the audience.</p>
      <p>The first show, which took place at Sudarshan Rangmanch in Pune recently, was raw and had the quality of an emotional outburst. The personal constantly bled into the performance. She did create a wall between herself and the audience by placing a neutral density paper, a transparent sheet that is used in film lighting. It served to distance the action, as well as created the impression of the actor being enclosed in a claustrophobic environment. “Numb all senses and do not ask questions. So, what if the economy is crashing? So, what if the petrol prices are rising. Don’t say anything if you are being raped, molested or trees are being cut. Pichhle sattar saal se desh azad hai but you are not,” she says.</p>
      <p>Walvekar was born into theatre. Her parents met in the legendary play, Janata Raja. It is a three-hour production that tells the story of Shivaji with larger-than-life sets and characters, animals and 250 artistes. She studied at Sir Parshurambhau College till her Classs XII and completed her under-graduation in mass media at Ramnarain Ruia College in Mumbai. Studying Masters in Arts and Aesthetics at JNU, she along with Shramona Das, created site-specific plays, based on the practice of gender and feminism. “I am drawn to plays where characters drive the plot and not the other way around,” she says. Her MPhil thesis at JNU is titled, “In the name of Shivaji: A critical genealogy on the performance of Shivaji on stage” and show how the 17th-century warrior is portrayed in plays at present.</p>
      <p>Though she has performed a few farces on gender at JNU, this is the first time in six years that Walvekar is acting on stage. “Death of an Anti-National emerged from living for so long with anger. I had to get it out and be ok with it,” she says. At one point in the play, she sheds light on her state of mind: “Every morning, I get up and tell myself that everything is beautiful and I will be happy today. Every night, the castle of illusion falls down.”</p>
