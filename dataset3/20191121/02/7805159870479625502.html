      <h1>Samsung Galaxy S11 gets certified with 5G and 25W charging support</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:58:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:58</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Even though the Galaxy S11 series is months away from launch, leaks about the upcoming flagships from Samsung have already started surfacing online. Earlier this month, renowned leakster Evan Blass <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-s11-s11e-leak-5g-curved-amoled-display/">shared key details</a> of the next-gen flagships. Shortly thereafter, a teardown of Samsung’s Camera app <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-app-8k-video-209-aspect-ratio-108mp/">revealed strings of code</a> that suggest that the Galaxy S11 might feature a 108MP camera and support for up to 8K video recording. Most recently, reputed tipster Ice universe <a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1197178837055852545">shared a screenshot</a> of One UI 2.0 beta running on the <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-9">Galaxy Note 9</a> which suggests that the devices may even feature a 120Hz high refresh rate display. Now, a recent certification listing from China confirms a few more details about the upcoming Galaxy S11.</p>

      <p>The listing in question is from China’s CCC and it clears certification for a Samsung device with the model number SM-G9860. Believed to be the Galaxy S11, the device features support for 5G and 25-watt fast charging. The 5G support is in line with the previous leak from Evan Blass, but we had no prior knowledge of the 25-watt fast charging support. It’s worth noting that the Galaxy S10 series included support for 15-watt fast charging, however, the Galaxy S10 5G included support for up to 25-watt fast charging. While it’s good to see that Samsung is including support for faster charging speeds on its next-gen flagships, the 25-watt rating pales in comparison to the 50-watt fast charging support in the <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/realme-x2-pro-snapdragon-855-plus-50w-fast-charging-64mp-camera-india-launch/">recently launched</a> Realme X2 Pro. As of now, we have no further information on the hardware specifications of the Galaxy S11 series, but we expect to learn more over the coming weeks.</p>
