      <h1>Debate crowd erupts in laughs as Sanders chimes in 'I wrote the damn bill' on Medicare for All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:31:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/max-greenwood" target="_blank">Max Greenwood</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) scored the first laugh of the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday by dredging up an old line: "I wrote the damn bill."</p>
      <p>Sanders first made the quip — a reference to his signature "Medicare for All" legislation — during the second Democratic primary debate in July after one of his rivals, Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/tim-ryan">Tim Ryan</a> (D-Ohio), suggested that the Vermont senator was unaware of what the single-payer health care proposal actually entailed.</p>
      <p>Since then, Sanders has capitalized on that phrase, repeating it at times during public appearances and even <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/455481-sanders-campaign-selling-i-wrote-the-damn-bill-stickers-after-viral-debate">selling campaign merchandise emblazoned with the slogan</a>.</p>

      <p>It resurfaced once again on Wednesday night after Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sanders's chief ideological rival in the presidential race, responded to a debate question about Medicare for All.</p>
      <p>Once Warren finished her answer, the debate moderators posed a similar question to Sanders.</p>
      <p>"Thank you. I wrote the damn bill," Sanders said as the crowd briefly erupted in laughter.</p>
