      <h1>Skip Bayless Rips Ezekiel Elliott For His Terrible 2019 Season After Signing Massive Contract (VIDEO)</h1>

      <p>Skip Bayless is really upset.</p>
      <p>The noted Dallas Cowboys fan has been having quite the issue with Ezekiel Elliott over the past few games, especially after he was given a massive contract just before the season began.</p>
      <p>Elliott has yet to live up to the hype of that contract and it has been Dak Prescott that has been carrying the team throughout the first half of the season.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday’s edition of Undisputed, Bayless went on a very lengthy rant about Elliott’s poor play, and although it was harsh at time, it was fair and honest.</p>

      <p>“I know I’m a psycho fan, I know I just lose it during Cowboy games, but I am beating my head against my wall because every 1st down it’s Zeke for 1 yard, Zeke for 2, or Zeke for 0,” Bayless said.</p>
      <p>Bayless also spoke on Dak Prescott’s ability to “match” his Sunday opponent Tom Brady.</p>
      <p>“Since day one of this show, dating to 2016, I have sat over here and I have told that Dak Prescott is Brady-esque,” Bayless declares. He’s quick to clarify that he doesn’t believe that Prescott will surpass the eventual Hall-of-Famer, but believes he could have a similar resume when all is said and done.</p>
      <p>“He will never be Brady, because there’s only one of those guys. But he is Brady-esque in that you can compare him to Tom Brady in a few categories.”</p>
      <p>“All he’s done in his first three years…Dak Prescott led the NFL in game-winning drives,” Bayless says. “So I think, given the opportunities in bigger, bigger stages, he can match Tom Brady in clutchness because Tom Brady’s the clutchest athlete I’ve ever seen because he’s had so many opportunities.”</p>
