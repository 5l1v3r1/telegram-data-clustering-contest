      <h1>Ex-LSU frat bro gets wrist slap in pledge’s alcohol-related hazing death</h1>

      <p>The former Louisiana State University student <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/07/17/frat-bro-found-guilty-in-pledges-alcohol-related-hazing-death/">found guilty in the alcohol-related hazing death</a> of a fraternity pledge was sentenced to five years in prison on Wednesday — but will likely serve only a few months behind bars, officials said.</p>
      <p>Judge Beau Higginbotham slapped Matthew Naquin with the maximum sentence for negligent homicide in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/03/15/4-indicted-in-hazing-death-of-frat-pledge/">2017 death of of 18-year-old Max Gruver</a> — and suspended all but 2 ½ years of the term, <a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/courts/article_5a08f730-0a48-11ea-8dcd-0b4903e2c7be.html">The Advocate reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Naquin, the key is in your pocket now,” the judge told Naquin. “You are being given a chance that Mr. Gruver didn’t have.”</p>
      <p>Naquin, 21, will be up for parole after 7 ½ months, but could end up serving even less time, said District Attorney Hillar Moore.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Naquin was primarily responsible for the death of Gruver — who had been at LSU a month when he died of alcohol poisoning, the morning after a Phi Delta Theta hazing ritual <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/03/frat-pledges-death-linked-to-boozy-bible-study-events/">dubbed “Bible Study.”</a> It took less than an hour for the jurors to convict Naquin in July.</p>
      <p>“He singled out my son and killed him,” the victim’s dad, Stephen Gruver, said in court.</p>
      <p>Gruver and other pledges were forced to chug 190-proof liquor during the Sept. 13, 2017, event, if they didn’t know the answers to questions about the frat or couldn’t recite the Greek alphabet.</p>
      <p>A toxicologist testified that Gruver was a “dead man walking” after downing the booze. His blood-alcohol level was at 0.495%, more than six times the legal driving limit in Louisiana when he died.</p>
      <p>He had a garbage bag tied around his neck to catch his vomit, Gruver’s dad said.</p>
      <p>“Clearly he had too much, but it wasn’t enough for Matthew Naquin,” Stephen Gruver said. “The actions of this hazer resulted in my son’s death.”</p>
      <p>Several witnesses testified at trial that Naquin disliked Gruver and wanted him out of the frat, playing a central role in the deadly hazing.</p>
      <p>When it was his turn to give a statement, Naquin expressed his condolences to the Gruver family, but did not directly apologize.</p>
      <p>The Texas native said he’d been wrongly portrayed as a murderer and and is “haunted by a single event.” It’s “simply not true” that he “had it out for Max,” he said.</p>
      <p>Naquin’s former LSU roommate, Ryan Matthew Isto, 20, of Butte, Montana, and ex-LSU student Sean-Paul Gott, 22, of Lafayette, Louisiana, pleaded no contest last year to misdemeanor hazing.</p>
      <p>They both received 30-day jail terms, and Naquin’s lawyer had asked for something comparable.</p>
      <p>“Matthew’s conduct was no worse than theirs,” said attorney John McLindon.</p>
      <p>Naquin will remain free on bond as he appeals his negligent homicide conviction and is due in court June 23.</p>
      <p>In addition to jail time, he was sentenced to three years supervised probation once released, fined $1,000, ordered to perform 1,000 hours of community service, give anti-hazing talks to high school students and write an apology letter to Gruver’s parents.</p>
      <p>He’s also been <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/29/judge-orders-ex-student-to-turn-over-phone-passcode-in-frat-pledges-hazing-death/">charged with obstruction of justice</a> for allegedly deleting thousands of files from his phone during the criminal investigation. His next court date on that charge is Feb. 11.</p>
      <p>Phi Delta Theta was banned from the LSU campus until at least 2033 after a probe into Gruver’s death.</p>
