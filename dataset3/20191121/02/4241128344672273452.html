      <p>Take This is happy to announce that our Giving Tuesday fundraiser, <a href="https://tiltify.com/+take-this-giving-tuesday/take-this-tuesday-2019">Take This Tuesday</a>, is now live! Beginning now and lasting through Giving Tuesday on December 3rd, our team and the Take This Streaming Ambassadors will be streaming and raising money to help us fulfill our mission.</p>
      <p>We’re thrilled to be able to provide our services to the gaming community at events across the country, big and small. Giving Tuesday and other fundraisers during the year help us increase the scope of what we can do, <a href="https://www.takethis.org/programs/industry-research/state-of-the-industry-white-paper/">expand our research</a>, and continue to provide the AFK Room, a quiet room staffed with clinical therapists, to conventions.</p>
      <p>We greatly appreciate <a href="https://tiltify.com/+take-this-giving-tuesday/take-this-tuesday-2019/donate">your support</a> and thank you for letting us serve you!</p>
      <p><b>About Giving Tuesday:</b> GivingTuesday is a global generosity movement unleashing the power of people and organizations to transform their communities and the world on December 3, 2019 and every day. It was created in 2012 as a simple idea: a day that encourages people to do good.</p>
