      <h1>AUD bearish: Moody's downgrades Australian states' outlook to 'negative'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:51:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>The Australian Financial Review (AFR) reports the latest comments from Moody's Senior Credit Officer John Manning after the global rating agency downgraded the Australian states’ outlook from ‘stable’ to ‘negative’.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <blockquote>Lower goods and services tax collection and higher debt will dampen revenues and the ability to keep their economies growing.<br/><br/>Lower GST revenues will make it harder for state governments to keep investing in the economy at a time when government investment has been driving economic growth.<br/><br/>Public spending on infrastructure is "underpinning economic activity".</blockquote>
      <p>The rating downgrade news is seen weighing negatively on the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/audusd">Aussie</a> dollar, keeping AUD/USD capped below 0.6800 despite the latest trade-positive comments by the Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He. </p>
