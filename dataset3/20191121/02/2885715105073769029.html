      <p>A three-month-old baby, whose upper arm was amputated after he suffered burns in the paediatric ICU of KEM hospital following a short-circuit in ECG nodes, is in critical condition and on ventilator support.</p>
      <p>The baby, Prince, is being treated for congenital heart defect and pneumonia.</p>
      <p>According to dean Dr Hemant Deshmukh, the blood pressure of the baby has been fluctuating for the last four-five days. “The baby has been less responsive today. We have informed his parents about how critical he is,” he said.<br/>Prince suffered burns on his hand, shoulder and scalp on November 7 after the ECG nodes attached to his chest caught fire and spread to the mattress on which he was lying.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred in the paediatric ICU of KEM hospital. Four days later, as infection spread, his left upper arm was amputated.</p>
      <p>Doctors treating him said while his “central pulses are good, his peripheral pulses are just palpable”. The baby remains on ventilator support battling for life.</p>
      <p>A BMC probe report into the incident is expected this week.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the BMC will give Rs 10 lakh compensation to Prince. The decision was taken at a group leaders’ meeting on Wednesday. Corporators had demanded that Rs 10 lakh compensation should be given to Prince’s family.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the family had rejected the Rs 5 lakh compensation offered by the BMC, claiming that the child will require more financial aid for surgeries required in future.</p>
      <p>Besides, the civic body will also formulate a comprehensive policy for compensating victims where the BMC is found negligent or accidents on its premises.</p>
      <p>Corporators had suggested that a comprehensive compensation policy should be formulated on the lines of airlines, railways and state government policies.</p>
      <p>The policy is likely to include deaths caused by tree fall and drowning in sewerage lines, among others. But there was no word on whether deaths caused by potholes will be part of the policy. Mayor Vishwanath Mahadeshwar said, “We have decided to give compensation to the victims and asked the administration to draft a policy which will take care of such situations arising in future.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the civic body will also give Rs 10 lakh compensation to the family of Rajesh Maru, who died after being sucked into an MRI machine in BYL Nair Hospital in January 2018.</p>
