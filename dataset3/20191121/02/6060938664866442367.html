      <h1>Exclusive! Anees Bazmee on Kriti Kharbanda and Pulkit Samrat's love affair, says 'mujhe feel ho raha tha inki thodi dosti jyada ho rahi hai'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-Tejashree-Bhopatkar-479228026.cms" target="_blank">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Anees Bazmee's multi-starrer, 'Pagalpanti' is all set to hit the theatres soon. The film is just a few hours away from its big release and the entire star-cast is all excited for it. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anil-Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arshad-Warsi">Arshad Warsi</a>, John Abraham, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Urvashi-Rautela">Urvashi Rautela</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pulkit-Samrat">Pulkit Samrat</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kriti-Kharbanda">Kriti Kharbanda</a>, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ileana-D-Cruz">Ileana D'cruz</a> are on the promotional spree these days and are not leaving any stone unturned to promote the film to the maximum levels.</p>
      <p>Directed <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Anees-Bazmee">Anees Bazmee</a> too is all geared up for his next mad comedy and is equally excited for the film's release. Talking about the love birds Kriti and Pulkit who are painting the town red with their fresh love story, Anees spoke to Etimes exclusively. He said, "mujhe feel ho raha tha inki thodi dosti jyada ho rahi hai', baakiyo ke bhi dosti hai but inki jyada hai' (friendship between these two is something else and not just friendship). But Pulkit and Kriti being in love turned out beneficial for me as they are paired opposite to each other in the film and there were scenes where they need to hug and kiss each other. So that came naturally to them. Their off-screen love reflected in their characters and that benefited the film."</p>
      <p>He further said, "Whatever that is good for the film is good for me. But if something is harming the film, I will consider that as wrong. So even if involves someone's personal life, it is wrong for me."</p>
      <p>For the uninitiated, Kriti Kharbanda has confirmed dating her Pagalpanti co-star Pulkit Samrat. Talking to Etimes she said, "No, they are not rumours. We are dating each other. In all honesty, I wanted my parents to know first that I’m dating someone and when you start seeing someone, it’s I think there’s a time for everything when you’re comfortable talking about it. Sometimes it can take five years, sometimes it can take five months. In our case, it was five months, but I’m in a very happy place and I have no qualms admitting that I am dating Pulkit Samrat.”</p>
