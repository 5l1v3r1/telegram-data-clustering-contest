      <p>The popular Surulere Plaza has been razed by an inferno that claimed property and valuables worth millions of naira. The sad event was said to have been triggered by an electrical power surge which started in a shop within the one-storey building and later spread to other parts of the building.</p>
      <p>The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Lagos State Fire Service, Nigerian Police Force, LNSC, the Federal Fire Service and were still battling the fire as of press time.</p>
      <p>LASEMA Public Affairs Officer, Nosa Okunbor, stated that the Agency was battling to curtail a fire outbreak at a Mall in the Akerele area of Surulere. He said the fire gutted the upper floor of the one- storey building.</p>

      <p>“The fire according to the outcome of preliminary investigations conducted at the site of the incident was said to have resulted from an electrical surge in one of the shops before escalating to other parts of the plaza.</p>
      <p>“However, no life was lost, neither was any injury recorded so far at the scene where properties worth a fortune have been lost to the blaze. “</p>
      <p>He said a combined team of LASEMA officials, Officers of the Nigerian Police Force, LNSC, the Federal and LASG Fire Services, were already on the ground trying to curtail the inferno from escalating to the adjoining buildings.</p>
