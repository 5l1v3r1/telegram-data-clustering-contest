      <p>CAIRO (AP) — Authorities say a man from a Gulf Arab country who was travelling from Egypt to Saudi Arabia has been detained at the Cairo airport, allegedly attempting to take banned pills into the kingdom.</p>
      <p>A statement from the airport authorities on Thursday says security officials found dozens of illegal pills in his luggage. Egypt prohibits the import and export of narcotic drugs.</p>
      <p>The passenger, who was not identified, provided a prescription and proof of medical need. He is being examined by a doctor to verify his condition.</p>
      <p>Last week, a French passenger was arrested at the Cairo airport for allegedly attempting to smuggle over a thousand pills of outlawed painkillers.</p>
