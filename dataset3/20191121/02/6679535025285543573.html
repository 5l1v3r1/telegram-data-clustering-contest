      <p>District Collector I. Samuel Ananda Kumar said here on Wednesday that cotton procurement should start immediately and asked the marketing department to provide enough publicity to cotton procurement centres.</p>
      <h3>MSP</h3>
      <p>Addressing a review meeting here, the Collector said that the minimum support price(MSP) of cotton was fixed at ₹5,500 per quintal, but as the Cotton Corporation of India did not enter the market, the private traders were buying the cotton at just ₹3,500 a quintal.</p>
      <p>Stating that the private buyers were taking the farmers for a ride , the Collector said extensive publicity would be provided to cotton purchase centres.</p>
      <p>Joint Collector Dinesh Kumar was among those present.</p>
