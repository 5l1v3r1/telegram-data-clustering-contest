      <h1>China’s Vice-Premier Liu: “Cautiously optimistic” about reaching a trade deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:24:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>China’s Vice-Premier and Chief trade negotiator Liu He is on the wires now, via Bloomberg, noting that he is "cautiously optimistic" about reaching a phase one trade deal. </p>
      <p>He added that he remains confident but confused about the US demands.</p>
      <p>Liu also explained “China’s plans for reforming state enterprises, opening up the financial sector, and enforcing intellectual property rights -- issues which are at the core of U.S. demands for change in China’s economic system,” Bloomberg reports.</p>
      <p>Despite Liu still expecting the preliminary trade deal signing, markets are not buying into it as of now, with escalating US-China political tensions over the Hong Kong bill and following the latest comments from US President Trump.</p>

      <p>The risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> is seen recovering on the above comments, despite Trump expected to sign the bill into law after the US House approved it late Wednesday. USD/JPY is off the lows, but still struggling around 108.50 level while S&amp;P 500 futures are down -0.25% and Treasury yields lose 0.50% across the curve.</p>
