      <h1>After Maharashtra and Jharkhand, BJP receives jolt from ally in Bihar as Prashant Kishor protests against Amit Shah’s NRC plan</h1>

      <p>Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday told the parliament that his government intended to roll out the controversial list or National Register for Citizens across India. Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Shah said that not only did he intend to implement the NRC across India but also pass the Citizenship Amendment Bill which will guarantee automatic citizenship to all illegal immigrants of all faiths living in India except Muslims. His comments evoked strong reactions from one of his party’s most-trusted allies, the Janata Dal-United, in Bihar.</p>

      <p>Without mincing words, JDU leader Prashant Kishor wrote on Twitter, “15 plus states with more than 55% of India’s population have non-BJP Chief Ministers. Wonder how many of them are consulted and are on-board for NRC in their respective states!!”</p>

      <p>The preparation of NRC in Assam under the supervision of the Supreme Court saw the exclusion of 19 lakh Indians including <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/not-a-single-hindu-will-have-to-leave-this-country-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-after-assam-nrc-excludes-12-lakh-names-of-hindus/267223/">12 lakh Hindus. </a>This has now prompted many BJP leaders to demand for a second NRC in Assam since the original exercise backfired for the saffron party as the party expected to exclude a large population of Muslims in Assam and send them to detention centres by rendering them stateless.</p>
      <p>The then state coordinator of NRC, Prateek Hajela, was later transferred out of Assam at the instruction of the Supreme Court. The Modi government later appointed civil servant Hitesh Dev Sharma as the new NRC coordinator.</p>
      <p>Many believe that the BJP government at the Centre is using the NRC to distract people from its poor governance. By keeping the citizens busy with the polarising issue of the NRC, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his deputy Amit Shah want voters to not grill them about their inability to run the country effectively.</p>
      <p>Earlier, BJP lost two allies namely the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the LJP in Jharkhand. The LJD led by Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan has <a href="http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/after-maharashtra-bjp-suffers-jolt-from-allies-in-poll-bound-jharkhand/272257/">decided to contest</a> the upcoming assembly polls on its own.</p>
