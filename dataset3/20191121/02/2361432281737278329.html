      <p>The second installment of “Miracle Workers” is coming early next year, but Buscemi and Radcliffe aren’t playing God and angel anymore — this season is set in medieval times.</p>
      <p>Called “Miracle Workers: Dark Ages,” the new season is set to debut Jan. 28 on TBS.</p>
      <p>In the teaser video, Radcliffe plays the son of a king who likes to feed ducks in his spare time. It’s unclear yet exactly Buscemi’s new character is, but he seems to have been demoted to a far lower post than God. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNRanWod3d0#action=share">watch the teaser</a> above.</p>

      <p>Created by Simon Rich and executive produced by Lorne Michaels, “Miracle Workers: Dark Ages” tells a medieval story about friendship, family and trying not to be murdered.</p>
      <p>Here is the official logline:</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Miracle Workers: Dark Ages” centers upon a group of medieval villagers trying to stay positive in an age of extreme income inequality, poor healthcare, and widespread ignorance. This 10-episode installment will feature Daniel Radcliffe, Steve Buscemi, Geraldine Viswanathan, Karan Soni, Jon Bass, and Lolly Adefope returning in new roles and facing new challenges.</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/miracle-workers-simon-rich-daniel-radcliffe-steve-buscemi/">The first season</a> of “Miracle Workers” was based on Rich’s book, “What in God’s Name,” and followed <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/miracle-workers-steve-buscemi-god-tbs/">Buscemi as God</a> and CEO of Heaven Inc., the grossly-mishandled corporation in the sky that puts angels to work making the world go round. But the fate of humanity is thrown into jeopardy when God, whilst going through a “midlife crisis,” decides to pull the plug on the whole operation.</p>
