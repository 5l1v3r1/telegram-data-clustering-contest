      <p>Since the release of the first <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/razer-phone-review">Razer Phone</a> back in 2017, many have wondered when we'd see smartphones with high 120Hz refresh rates for their displays become more mainstream.</p>
      <p>Well, it seems we won't have to wait much longer – rumors have already suggested that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/apples-2020-iphones-could-be-getting-120hz-displays">Apple's 2020 iPhones could be getting 120Hz displays</a>, while the OnePlus 8 Pro is expected to get an even smoother screen than the 90Hz ones the Chinese company currently offers with its <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-7t-pro-review">OnePlus 7T Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-7-pro">OnePlus 7 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oneplus-7t">OnePlus 7T</a>.</p>
      <p>It appears that Samsung is also planning a screen update for its upcoming <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11">Galaxy S11</a> flagship. An unknown user has discovered hidden settings within the beta for Samsung's upcoming One UI update that offer a choice between 60Hz and 120Hz refresh rates, as revealed by noted Twitter leaker @UniverseIce.</p>

      <p>As you can see above, the tipster goes on to explain that a third option is also offered which allows the phone to automatically switch between 60Hz and 120Hz modes depending on context.</p>
      <p>While the setting was discovered by a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-review">Galaxy Note 9</a> user, neither that handset nor any of Samsung's other phone displays currently support 120Hz refresh rates.</p>
      <p>This would strongly suggest that the South Korean electronics giant is planning to upgrade its phone display technology for the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11">Samsung Galaxy S11</a> and beyond – could 120Hz support be one of the tenets of Samsung's rumored '<a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-will-have-new-screen-tech-but-will-it-make-a-viewable-difference">SAMOLED</a>' display? Chances are we won't find out until <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s11-could-land-on-february-18">February 18, 2020</a>.</p>
