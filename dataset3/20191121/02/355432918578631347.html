      <h1>Klobuchar shuts down idea a woman can't beat Trump: 'Pelosi does it every day'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:50:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/julia-manchester" target="_blank">Julia Manchester</a></address>
      <p>Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/amy-klobuchar">Amy Klobuchar</a> (D-Minn.) shut down the idea that a woman cannot beat <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>, citing House Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>'s (D-Calif.), on Thursday at the Democratic primary debate in Atlanta. </p>
      <p>"Women are held to a higher standard," Klobuchar said. "Otherwise, we could play a game called name your favorite woman president, which we can't do because it has all been men."</p>
      <p>"And if you think a woman can't beat Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi does it every single day," she continued. </p>

      <p>Klobuchar was expanding on comments she made earlier this month on CNN, saying women candidates are held to a higher standard than male candidates.  The Minnesota senator made the comments in reference to South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> (D), saying a woman with his experience would not be on a presidential debate stage.  “Of the women on the stage, I’m focusing here on my fellow women senators, Sens. Harris and Warren and myself, do I think we would be standing on that stage if we had the experience that he had? No, I don’t,” Klobuchar said.  Klobuchar and Buttigieg are both from the midwest and have presented themselves as moderates in the primary.  However, Klobuchar has struggled to gain traction in the polls and fundraising, while Buttigieg has climbed to the top-four tier of the crowded primary pack. </p>
