      <h1>Ohio State Fans Are Trying To “Boycott” ESPN’s College GameDay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:25:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>College GameDay </i>will be in Columbus, Ohio on Saturday for Ohio State’s big home game against Penn State. Not everyone is happy about this.</p>
      <p>A group of Ohio State fans are trying to get #BoycottGameDay trending on Twitter in anticipation of Saturday’s show. Buckeyes fans have had issues with ESPN for a while, but things have boiled up thanks to the Urban Meyer/Zach Smith scandal. Some fans also believe the Worldwide Leader has an SEC bias.</p>
      <p>FOX’s pregame show, <i>Big Noon Kickoff</i>, will also be in town. That show features Meyer, who’s been highly praised for his work as an analyst.</p>
      <p>Meyer has been vocal on social media this week, pushing for Ohio State fans to attend his show and not <i>College GameDay</i>.</p>

      <p>It’s unclear how successful this #BoycottGameDay attempt will be, but Buckeyes fans are continuing to tweet about it.</p>

      <p>ESPN’s <i>College GameDay </i>has been the preeminent college football pregame show for decades and the show has been to Ohio State several times. There are likely a bunch of fan bases that think ESPN gives <i>too much </i>love to Ohio State, while there are Buckeyes fans who think it’s the opposite.</p>
      <p>It will be interesting to see what happens on Saturday morning. FOX’s pregame show will be going head-to-head with ESPN and there are a bunch of Ohio State fans who will want to see Urban Meyer.</p>
      <p>Everything will kick off on Saturday morning in Columbus.</p>
