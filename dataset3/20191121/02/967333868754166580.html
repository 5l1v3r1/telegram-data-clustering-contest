        <b>New Delhi (Sputnik): Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2016 announced a ban on high value Rs.1,000 and Rs. 500 currency notes in circulation, as a means of curbing forgery, terror funding and black money. India’s total currency in circulation, worth $200 billion at the time, was swapped with fresh Rs. 2,000 and Rs. 500 notes.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite New Delhi's November 2016 massive currency swap, counterfeit currency remains a challenge, according to the country’s top bank - Reserve Bank of India (RBI).</p>
      <blockquote>Even though the number of counterfeit notes in old currency series was eliminated in the first three months of current financial year, the new series, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201907171076270758-indias-hindu-nationalist-group-objects-government-plan-to-raise-funds-in-foreign-currency/">purported to be of very high security</a>, is increasingly being duplicated.</blockquote>
      <p>According to RBI statistics, the number of counterfeit demonetised Rs. 1,000 notes has come down from 0.25 million pieces in 2016-17 to “zero” pieces in the first three month of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>The RBI said 0.10 million fake Rs. 1,000 currency notes were detected in 2017-18, falling to a mere 717 in 2018-19. No fake demonetised Rs. 1,000 note has been detected between April and June this year.</p>
      <p>However, fake versions of the new high-security Rs. 2,000, Rs. 500, and Rs. 200 currency notes, are being <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201901101071365217-india-financial-help-srilanka/">detected with increasing regularity</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>As per the RBI, the number of counterfeit Rs.500 notes in the new series increased by 121 percent in 2018-19, compared with 2017-18. Similarly, in case of the new Rs. 2,000 note, counterfeiting increased by 21.9 percent during 2018-19, against the previous fiscal.</blockquote>
      <p>The denomination of Rs. 200 was introduced in August 2017. A total of 12,728 counterfeit notes of Rs. 200 denomination were detected in 2018-19, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201812051070413126-india-uae-deal-local-currencies-avoiding-dollar-transactions/">compared with 79 the year of its introduction</a>.</p>
      <p>Several forgers have been busted recently, in the cities of Kolkata, Madurai and various other parts of the country.</p>
