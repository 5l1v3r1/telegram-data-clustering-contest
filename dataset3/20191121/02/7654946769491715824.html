      <p>A 10-year-old boy who was struck by gunfire last Friday night during a high school football game in New Jersey died of his injuries Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Micah Tennant was one of three people wounded when a <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/2-wounded-when-gunman-opens-fire-at-packed-nj-high-school-football-game/">gunman opened fire at the game</a> between Pleasantville High School and Camden High School in Pleasantville, outside of Atlantic City, the county prosecutor’s office said.</p>
      <p>Tennant, who was shot in the neck, died of his injuries Wednesday, authorities said. A 27-year-old man and a 15-year-old boy were also wounded in the shooting, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The suspected gunman, Alvin Wyatt, was hit with an upgraded charge of murder after Tennant died Wednesday, authorities said.</p>
      <p>“Words at this time seem so insufficient to portray the anger and outrage that our community feels regarding his loss,” Atlantic County Prosecutor Damon G. Tyner said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“However, his spirit will live on in so many people that he inspired.”</p>
      <p>Four other people who were carrying weapons at the game were also charged in connection to the shooting.</p>
