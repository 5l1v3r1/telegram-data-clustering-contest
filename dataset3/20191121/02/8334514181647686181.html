      <p>BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday he did not watch a testimony from European Union Ambassador Gordon Sondland in the impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump and that he was proud of American policy in Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t see a single thing ... I was working, I was in meetings all day,” Pompeo told reporters after a NATO foreign ministers’ meeting. “I haven’t had a chance to see any of that testimony.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he was considering recusing himself from decisions on documents provided to the U.S. Congress, he said: “I am not going to recuse myself from this. I know precisely what American policy was with respect to Ukraine, I was working on it and I am terribly proud of what we accomplished.”</p>
