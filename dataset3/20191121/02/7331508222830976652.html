      <h1>Safety Eric Weddle says he won't share Ravens intel with Rams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:56:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:56</time> by <a rel="author">Lindsey Thiry</a></address>
      <p>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lar/los-angeles-rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>' Monday Night Football matchup with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a> is a critical game for the 6-4 Rams, who desperately need a win to remain in the playoff hunt one season after appearing in Super Bowl LIII.</p>
      <p>But don't expect the circumstances to compromise the ethics of Rams safety <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/10481/eric-weddle">Eric Weddle</a>, who played the previous three seasons with the Ravens.</p>
      <p>Weddle said Wednesday that he won't be sharing any inside secrets about his former team.</p>
      <p>"I could tell them a lot of stuff, but that's just not who I am," said Weddle, who signed a two-year, $10.5 million contract with the Rams after the Ravens released him in March. "So we're going to play it on the field, and the best team is going to win."</p>
      <p>Rams coach Sean McVay, who calls offensive plays, often acknowledges Weddle's intelligence and has said the 13-year NFL veteran has provided him with football insights and perspective since his arrival.</p>
      <p>However, McVay said Wednesday that he had not spoken to Weddle about the nuances of the Ravens' defense, which is limiting opponents to 19.6 points per game (sixth in the league).</p>
      <p>"I think he's got a lot of loyalty to those guys, even if he's not there anymore," McVay said.</p>
      <p>It's uncertain whether Ravens cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578378/marcus-peters">Marcus Peters</a>, whom Los Angeles dealt to Baltimore in a mid-October trade, will share any specific insights about the Rams' operation with his new team.</p>
      <p>Asked if it could be considered unfair to share inside information about a former team, McVay said, "It's totally at each person's individual approach."</p>
      <p>It would seem the Rams -- who have a 19% chance of making the playoffs, according to ESPN's Football Power Index -- could use any information available to help slow down the 8-2 Ravens. Baltimore is averaging an NFL-best 34.1 points per game behind quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916387/lamar-jackson">Lamar Jackson</a> -- the front-runner to win the MVP award.</p>
      <p>Still, Weddle won't budge.</p>
      <p>"I have a lot of respect for that place, not only how it helped my career and rejuvenated my career, how they treated myself and my family," Weddle said. "But it's a very tight-knit group, and what would I be -- what kind of man would I be if I just turned my back on all of them?"</p>
      <p>The Ravens signed Weddle to a four-year, $26-million contract in 2016, after he had a falling out with the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers">Chargers</a>, with whom he spent the first nine seasons of his career.</p>
