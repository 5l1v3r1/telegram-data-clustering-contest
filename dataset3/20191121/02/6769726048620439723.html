      <p>COMMUNITY News media partner Sportsedge Media was awarded the Perth Football League Media Award at the WA Football Media Guild Awards at Optus Stadium this month.</p>
      <p>Its program Perth Footy Live covered a game each week during the Perth Football League season with its panel of Cam Robbins, Ian McNeil and Michael ‘Chicko’ Carpio, along with game producer Craig Wilson.</p>
      <p>The coverage was live-streamed on Facebook, including on all Community News pages, which has worked closely with Edge Media Group for several years on local sports coverage.</p>
      <p>The concept of telling the stories of grassroots sporting clubs was devised by Edge Media Group director Tom Tapping, who worked closely with Perth Football league chief executive David Armstrong and his team to bring it to life.</p>
      <p>“It grew throughout this first season and the clubs, league and sponsors embraced the idea and we were welcomed and sought after to broadcast from grades all over Perth,” Mr Tapping said.</p>
      <p>“The team did a great job in telling the many stories that exist in every sporting club and it becomes much more than a footy broadcast when you hear the dedication and love people have for their clubs.</p>
      <p>“We’ve appreciated the support from the clubs, the Perth Football League and the many followers who tuned in to be part of the fun.”</p>
      <p>The program received corporate sponsorship and developed a ‘best burger’ competition that was keenly contested between clubs as the Footy Radio team sampled the wares of club canteens each week.</p>
      <p>The program will return to air next season and planning is underway to provide similar coverage to other sports.</p>
      <p>Subiaco dominated the football awards, with Josh Deluca winning the state player award, Ben Sokol the goalkicking award, Ryan Borchet the player of the future award, Lachlan Delahunty the player of the year award and Beau Wardman the coach of the year award.</p>
