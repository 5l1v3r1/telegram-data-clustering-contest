      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:32:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/stacey-solomon">Stacey Solomon</a> has admitted she and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/joe-swash">Joe Swash</a> won't be walking down the aisle any time soon.</p>
      <p>The telly star, 30, confessed she's in no rush to marry her soap star beau, 37, during a candid chat on ITV's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/loose-women">Loose Women</a> on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The loved-up couple have been together since 2015 and despite recently welcoming their first child together Rex six months ago, Stacey insisted the smitten pair feel like "everything else comes first."</p>
      <p>Stacey told her co-stars that a wedding isn't at the top of her priorities as the panel discussed what it would take to get them down in the aisle after recent news that a man is set to marry for the tenth time.</p>

      <p>She said: "I've always dreamed of having a wedding but now I'm older and have children and a relationship I absolutely love, I still don't feel like marriage is at the forefront for us.</p>
      <p>"I feel like everything else comes first and I'm not ultra religious and it's not something I feel like we need to have."</p>
      <p>Coleen Nolan then teased Stacey's response as she cheekily questioned: "Oh, but you'd like the [wedding] day wouldn't you?"</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> star laughed and replied "yes!"</p>

      <p>Stacey and Joe were recently forced to squash rumours that they secretly tied the knot during an idyllic family holiday to the Maldives.</p>
      <p>The Essex-born beauty posted a sweet family snap with the boys dressed in formal summer suits, and Joe wearing a shirt, amongst a romantic sunset backdrop.</p>
      <p>Excited fans rushed to the comment section of her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> to ask if the couple had married while on their sun-soaked getaway.</p>
      <p>Eagle-eyed fans who examined the photo more closely also commented on how they could see something glimmering on Joe's left hand.</p>

      <p>The star then addressed the speculation during an episode of Loose Women, where she mocked the rumours and sat amongst confetti with wedding bells playing in the background.</p>
      <p>Shaking her head when asked if she had married Joe, Stacey emphatically said: "No!"</p>
      <p>"First of all can I just clarify there's no ring," claimed Stacey as she brandished her bare finger.</p>
      <p>"Janet, would I get married without you?"</p>
      <p>Co-host Janet Street-Porter admitted Stacey would not have got married without her as she promised to make her a bridesmaid.</p>

Get Me Out Of Here!</a> in 2010 when the Essex girl was crowned Queen of the Jungle, recently <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/stacey-solomon-transforms-home-rexs-20375021">welcomed their first son</a> , Rex, together in June.</p>
