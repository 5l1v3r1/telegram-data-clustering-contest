      <p>PHILADELPHIA — The boos were plentiful and they were all directed at the home-team 76ers in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>It was looking like a giddy, gritty night Wednesday at Wells Fargo Center for the Knicks, who dominated the Sixers for much of three periods with scrappy play.</p>
      <p>The Knicks blasted to a 15-0 to start the second half and led by 17 points midway through the third — when reality set in against the Eastern Conference power.</p>
      <p>The Sixers rallied furiously and eked out a 109-104 victory against the Knicks to break their two-game winning streak.</p>
      <p>The Knicks (4-11) now have lost nine straight to the Sixers and their past seven in this arena.</p>
      <p>Sixers center Joel Embiid rallied after a terrible start to finish with 23 points and ruin some gutty performances by Frank Ntilikina and North Philly native Marcus Morris. In fact, Embiid and Morris went at it at one juncture.</p>
      <p>Ntilikina was as feisty on offense as he ever has been and finished with 17 points on 6-of-8 shooting, but coach David Fizdale may have replaced him with Dennis Smith Jr. for too long a stretch late in the third quarter — and the club lost its mojo. Julius Randle added 17 points with five Knicks in double figures.</p>

      <p>The stellar tough play of Morris (22 points, 13 rebounds, six assists) was evident and he intimidated Embiid for a while before Philly woke up.</p>
      <p>Sixers backup Mike Scott hit two late 3-pointers to preserve the victory as the Knicks fell to 4-11 in starting their stretch against 11 straight 2018-19 playoff teams.</p>
      <p>The Knicks led by as many as six points in the second period, playing sharp defense and getting under Embiid’s skin.</p>
      <p>That’s not exactly hard to do, but Morris did the trick, dragging down Embiid as he awaited an offensive rebound with 1:43 left in the half. Embiid flew to his feet in a rage and the two players tried to get after each other with the Sixers center and Morris shouting up a storm.</p>
      <p>Players intervened and peace prevailed, but a seven-minute referee review elevated the loose ball foul on Morris into a Flagrant 1 and each received a double technical.</p>
      <p>It became a 3-point play for the Sixers as Embiid sank one of two free throws and then buried a jumper as the Sixers retained possession. It gave the Sixers a 50-49 lead and they led 53-51 at intermission.</p>
      <p>Then the Knicks ran off a 15-0 run with the Sixers not scoring until six minutes had elapsed in the third quarter.</p>
      <p>The Sixers got booed off court in Philly with 4:00 left in the third with the Knicks up 75-60 after blasting to 24-7 run to start second half, following Morris drilling another 3.</p>
      <p>RJ Barrett dunked in a follow on a Randle fastbreak miss and the Knicks led 77-60. It was downhill from there as the Sixers took off in transition and started making 3s.</p>
      <p>The Knicks still clung to a 79-74 lead after three, but the Sixers had the momentum. Scott drilled a 3 with 4:58 left to put the Sixers up 93-90 and Ntilikina cooled off.</p>
      <p>The omen was with the Sixers all night however despite the Knicks’ strong play.</p>
      <p>In the opening minutes, star point guard Ben Simmons (18 points), in his first 3-point attempt of the season, made the first trey of his NBA career. He sank it from the right corner with Knicks center Mitchell Robinson closing slowly, seemingly willing to allow Simmons to launch after he had missed the first 17 3-point attempts of his career.</p>
      <p>It brought the house down as the fans were on their feet roaring for nearly a minute as play continued.</p>
