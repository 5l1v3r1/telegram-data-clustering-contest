      <h1>You know you are watching a Michael Bay film if…</h1>
      <h2>In this edition of our bi-weekly series 'You know you are watching,' we uncover the basic tropes of a Michael Bay directorial.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:25:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/anvita-singh/" target="_blank">Anvita Singh</a></address>
      <p>What does cinema mean? Well, it means different things to different people. In fact, there has been an ongoing debate in the movie world after American director Martin Scorsese brushed off the superhero genre of films by likening them to theme parks. But, as far as I am concerned, anything that excites, thrills and moves you is art. And believe it or not, Michael Bay movies are sufficiently exciting. And one person can like both Scorsese and Bay, at the same time.</p>
      <p>In today’s edition of ‘You know you are watching,’ I will be looking at Michael Bay’s style of filmmaking.</p>
      <p>
        <b>High-concept films</b>

      <p>For the uninitiated, this is not as impressive as it sounds. High-concept cinema is usually concerned with the kind of stories that deal with an uncomplicated, basic premise. And since we are talking about Bay here, his narratives are usually motivated by a simple theme which results in his characters pulling off ridiculous stunts (Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, all of the Transformers films).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Explosions</b>
      </p>
      <p>In any given Michael Bay movie, there are tons of explosions happening. It is another matter altogether whether those are needed at all in the film (and in that number). Cars overturning, vehicles going off the rails — those are the kind of things one usually associates with Bay’s projects.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Stylised sequences and visual effects</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sure, you might not see that much heart and emotional value in a typical Bay movie, but at least you get a chance to feast your eyes on slick, choreographed action scenes and awe-inspiring visual effects. Basically, you get your money’s worth.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Big movie stars</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rest assured that if you are watching a Michael Bay directorial, there are bound to be big stars involved. Bay has collaborated with the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Ben Affleck, Will Smith and the controversial Shia Labeouf in the past.</p>
