      <p>Medicare-for-all was once again the hot topic early in Wednesday's Democratic primary debate, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Vice President Joe Biden sparring on the best way to ensure all Americans have health care.</p>
      <p>Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the proud author of "the damn bill" that would establish Medicare-for-all, said there are candidates who do not believe in taking on the insurance and pharmaceutical industries, but "now is the time." He vowed that in the first week of a Sanders administration, "we will introduce Medicare-for-all. Medicare-for-all, that means no deductibles, no co-payments, no out-of-pocket expenses."</p>
      <p>Biden responded that it won't be that easy to enact. "Right now, the vast majority of Democrats do not support Medicare-for-all," he said. "It couldn't pass the United States Senate right now with Democrats. It couldn't pass the House." House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is skeptical of the plan, and the best move forward would be to "build on Obamacare," Biden said.</p>
      <p>There are 160 million people who like their private insurance, he continued, and "if they don't like it, they can buy into a Medicare-like proposal in my plan. Drug prices go down, premiums go down across the board. But here's the deal: They get to choose."</p>
