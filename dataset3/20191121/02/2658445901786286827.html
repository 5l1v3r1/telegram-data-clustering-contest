      <h3>By Andrew Abah, Abuja</h3>
      <p>German coach Gernot Rohr on Wednesday earned praises from the Minister of Youth and Sports Development Sunday Dare for the meritorious manner he has conducted the Super Eagles orchestra since he took the reins of the national team in 2016.</p>
      <p>Under the former Bordeaux coach, the Super Eagles earned a qualification to the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time since 2013 at Egypt 2019 where the team eventually clinched the bronze medal.  He also supervised the team’s qualification to the Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup in a seemingly difficult group that housed three former African champions including the much-dreaded Indomitable Lions of Cameroon, Fennecs of Algeria and Chipolopolo of Zambia.</p>
      <p>At a breakfast engagement with Minister shortly before the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, Rohr presented an autographed Ahmed Musa’s number 7 jersey and said the players were happy with the minister’s appointment, assuring that the Super Eagles will redouble  their efforts to ensure qualification for the 2021 AFCON to be hosted by Cameroon without dropping a point.</p>
      <p>“First, I bring you greetings from the players and they have sent me to present this signed Ahmed Musa Jersey to you which they would have done by themselves if you were in Uyo for their game against Benin Republic,” the 66-year-old coach said. “They equally said I should thank you for your support and encouragement and to assure you that they will make you proud by qualifying for the Nations Cup in 2021 without dropping point.</p>
      <p>“I am also happy working with this young team which I known in future Super Eagles will be a team to beat,” Rohr noted.</p>
      <p>Responding, Dare thanked Rohr for the good job he is doing and expressed satisfaction with the two recent 2021 AFCON matches as the Super Eagles beat Benin Republic (2-1 in Uyo)  and  Lesotho  (4 -2 away in Maseru) respectively.</p>
      <p>He urged the coach to take a look at   Nigeria’s Professional Football League: “Our league need to develop and any country without a strong league can’t compete globally. I urge you to look into our league to build the necessary confidence on our local players.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Minister has explained that the renewal of Rohr’s contract which expires June next year depends on his employer, Nigeria Football Federation (NFF).</p>
      <p>“The NFF will decide either to renew or not his (Rohr) contract,” he said. “It is their duty to evaluate what he has done since he took over as the head Coach. I have no say on that but for me, I am happy with the progress of our young team and I urge him to do more towards winning trophies.”</p>
