      <h1>Leading camera module suppliers to remain dominant in high-end segment</h1>

      <p>Major camera module suppliers in Taiwan and China will remain dominant in winning orders for high-end modules that are being sought by top-tier handset brands for performance upgrades of their next-generation smartphones, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p>For the purpose of differentiation, leading handset brands are equipped their new models with advanced camera modules that will deliver higher pixel density or higher photography capability for night and wide-angle shooting, coupled with AI-enabled functionality, said the sources.</p>
      <p>The ongoing camera upgrades have raised the bar for lesser players in terms of technology and production yield rates, prompting top-tier handset vendors to concentrate their orders on a few of primary suppliers, such as Taiwan's Largan Precision and China's Sunny Optical Technology, O-film Tech and Q Technology, said the sources.</p>
      <p>Largan is believed to he receiving camera module orders from Apple, Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Hisense, resulting in tight capacity at the firm, said the sources.</p>
      <p>Though a new plant became operational recently, Largan CEO Lin En-ping said earlier that its company's capacity will be fully utilized by the end of 2019 and that it could only ramp up output by hiking yield rates and production efficiency to meet growing demand because additional capacity will not be available until 2023.</p>
      <p>Sunny Optical reportedly shipped up to 421 million camera modules during the first 10 months of 2019 with its clients including Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and Samsung, revealed the sources.</p>
      <p>Camera module shipments from Q Technology reached 326 million units during the same period, according to company data.</p>
