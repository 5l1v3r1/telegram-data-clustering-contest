      <h1>St. John’s rebounds with blowout win over Columbia</h1>

      <p>Mike Anderson’s imprint at St. John’s was apparent immediately: The energy. The urgency. The aggressiveness. The unselfishness. The defense, always swarming. The boards, always crashed. The leads, always too small.</p>
      <p>Nothing changes. Not even after a loss.</p>
      <p>Returning from the shock of Saturday’s last-second defeat against Vermont, the Red Storm responded by removing all doubt from Wednesday’s outcome long before halftime and cruising to an 82-63 win over Columbia at Carnesecca Arena.</p>
      <p>St. John’s (4-1), which led by as many as 30 points, next hits the road for the first time this season in the Basketball Hall of Fame Tip-Off Tournament at Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Conn., where the Red Storm open with a rematch of last season’s NCAA Tournament against Arizona State.</p>
      <p>In a balanced effort, in which Anderson used 10 players for at least 13 minutes, senior Mustapha Heron led St. John’s with 15 points, while freshman Julian Champagnie added 14 points and seven rebounds.</p>
