      <p>The enforcement of the new vehicle number plates will begin on January 1, 2020.</p>
      <p>The Joint Tax Board announced this in a communique issued at the end of its 14th meeting in Abuja.</p>
      <p>The board said: “The enforcement of the new vehicle number plates shall commence with effect from January 1, 2020, upon the expiration of the one-year period of grace granted for the replacement of old vehicle number plates.”</p>
      <p>The communique explained that, in line with the provisions of the Personal Income Tax Act (as amended), the board had mandated the state revenue authorities, under the aegis of the State Joint Revenue Committee, to engage with the relevant authorities of local government councils and all relevant stakeholders to elicit the buy-in on the implementation of the unified sticker/emblem and ultimate eradication of all forms of unauthorised sale of stickers/emblem nationwide.</p>

      <p>The board resolved that states should make every effort to implement the Class ‘A’ driver’s licence and ensure that all motor vehicles, motorcycles and tricycles are duly registered.</p>
      <p>The JTB added: “States should ensure that data derived from the registration of motor vehicles, motorcycles and tricycles are regularly uploaded on to the National Vehicle Identification Scheme (NVIS) platform.”</p>
