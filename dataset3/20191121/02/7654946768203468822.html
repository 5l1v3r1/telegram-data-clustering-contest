      <h1>De Blasio slams ‘vampire’ Hiram Monserrate for seeking comeback</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:06:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:06</time> by <a rel="author">Julia Marsh, Bernadette Hogan and Carl Campanile</a></address>
      <p>Mayor Bill de Blasio slammed disgraced felon and ex-state Sen. Hiram Monserrate Wednesday as a shameless “vampire” for mounting <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/disgraced-pol-hiram-monserrate-plots-latest-comeback-with-assembly-bid/">another bid for public office</a> — and wished he’d just go away.</p>
      <p>“God help us all. It’s like — what is it? The vampire that keeps coming back,” de Blasio said of Monserrate filing paperwork to run for state Assembly against veteran incumbent Jeff Aubry.</p>
      <p>“We have to — well, we’re not allowed to put a stake through someone’s heart,” de Blasio chuckled.</p>
      <p>“He says he wants to run against Jeff Aubry who’s one of the — I think — most important voices of conscience in Albany, and I think is just an exemplary public servant.”</p>
      <p>Aubry, first elected in 1992, is one of the top leaders in the Assembly and one of the most prominent African-lawmakers in New York politics.</p>
      <p>“Hiram continues to be absolutely unrepentant and, you know, doesn’t learn the lesson that sometimes it’s best to just get out of the way,” Hizzoner added.</p>
      <p>Monserrate is feeling confident after he was elected a Democratic district leader last year within the 35th Assembly district Aubry represents, covering East Elmhurst and North Corona.</p>
      <p>His critics are taking him seriously by purchasing domain names for a potential campaign.</p>
      <p>Tap in the name “VoteHiram.com” and the New York Times story appears from when Monserrate pled guilty to misusing $100,000 in public funds as a city councilman. He was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
      <p>His candidacy could also spur momentum in Albany to pass legislation sponsored by Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D-Nassau) and Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz (D-Queens) to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/23/proposed-bill-would-keep-crooks-from-seeking-elected-office-for-10-years/">bar convicted felons</a> from running for elective office for at least ten years.</p>
      <p>“My bill is based on the simple premise that out of 100,000-plus people in an Assembly district, we can surely find one qualified<br/>person to represent the public who is not a convicted felon,” said Kaminsky, a former federal prosecutor.</p>
      <p>“Monserrate’s history of violating the public trust in such a gross and clear way, should disqualify him from being able to represent that, or any other district,” he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) issued a statement saying he is totally behind his pal Aubry and refused to even utter Monserrate’s name.</p>
      <p>“Throughout the course of his career, Jeff has proven to be a man of integrity, a strong voice for his constituents and a tireless advocate for all New Yorkers,” Heastie said.</p>
      <p>The ex-con has already lost three previous comeback races for the Senate, Assembly and City Council.</p>
      <p>Monserrate has been trying to return to elected office since he was expelled from the state Senate in 2010 after being convicted of a misdemeanor assault charge stemming from the brutal 2008 attack on his girlfriend, Karla Giraldo.</p>
      <p>The disgraced pol was <a href="https://nypost.com/2009/09/23/pol-appears-to-drag-girlfriend-from-queens-apartment-building-bombshell-video-shows/">caught on tape</a> dragging a battered and bleeding Giraldo through the lobby of his apartment building as she desperately tried to seek help from a neighbor.</p>
      <p>He was acquitted of charges that he first flew into a rage and slashed her face with a broken glass after discovering a police officer’s union card in her wallet.</p>
      <p>Monserrate’s lawyers claimed the cut came from a “freak accident” when he tripped while giving Giraldo a glass of water.</p>
      <p>Years later, Giraldo was sentenced to three years behind bars for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/26/karla-barba-gets-3-years-in-prison-for-samurai-sword-attack-on-fiance/">attacking her new fiancé</a> with a samurai sword.</p>
