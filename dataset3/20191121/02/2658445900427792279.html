      <p>Lagos Lawmakers probing former Governor Akinwunmi Ambode over the purchase of 820 buses as part of the Bus Reform Project of the state, on Wednesday, said the suit the former governor filed against them was incompetent.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the lawmakers, represented by Mr Lawal Pedro (SAN), also told an Ikeja High Court that it lacks the jurisdiction to hear the suit.</p>
      <p>They are also opposing an injunction Ambode seeks to restrain them from probing him.</p>
      <p>“We have filed a notice of preliminary objection, highlighting the incompetence of this suit.</p>
      <p>“We are, as well, challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit.</p>
      <p>“We also filed a counter-affidavit and a written address to the claimant’s motion for an interlocutory injunction,’’ Pedro said.</p>
      <p>He noted that Ambode’s counsel,  Mr Tayo Oyetibo, filed a written reply on points of law to the lawmakers’ motion, challenging the injunction, as well as a written address in opposition to the preliminary objection.</p>
      <p>Responding, Oyetibo confirmed receiving all the processes served on the claimant by the respondents.</p>
      <p>He said that Ambode had also responded to the processes.</p>
      <p>“We have, however, not been served with any defence, my lord, as there is nothing to defend,’’ Oyetibo said.</p>
      <p>Following the submission, Justice Yetunde Adesanya adjourned the suit for hearing.</p>
      <p>“This suit is adjourned to January 16, 2020, for hearing,’’ the judge said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that Ambode had instituted the civil suit against the state House of Assembly, its Speaker, Mr Mudashiru Obasa, and the House Clerk, Mr A.A. Sanni.</p>
      <p>Other respondents to the suit are Mr Fatai Mojeed, the Chairman of the Ad-hoc Committee set up by the House to probe the procurement of the buses, and eight members of the committee.</p>
      <p>The members of the Ad-hoc committee are Mr Gbolahan Yishawu, Mr A.A. Yusuf, Mr Yinka Ogundimu, Mrs Mojisola Meranda, Mr M.L. Makinde, Mr Kehinde Joseph, Mr Temitope Adewale and Mr Olanrewaju Afinni.</p>
