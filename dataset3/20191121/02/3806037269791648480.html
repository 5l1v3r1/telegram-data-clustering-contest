      <h1>Ghostemane Shares Blood-Curdling Stop Motion Visual for "Gatteka"</h1>
      <h2>Featuring the main villain from his forthcoming comic book.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:49:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:49</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/ghostemane">Ghostemane</a> has returned with a blood-curdling stop motion animation for his 2018 highlight “Gatteka.” Off of his overtly dark and exceedingly aggressive <i>N/O/I/S/E</i> project — aptly short for <i>No One Is Safe from Evil</i> — the track hones in on themes surrounding self-harm and enslavement, with lyrics pertaining to George Orwell’s <i>1984</i> and even the German demon Mephistopheles.</p>
      <p>These motifs are carried forth within the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tjystopmo/?hl=en">Thomas J Yagodinski</a> visual, whereby the haunting narrative and in-your-face visuals draw heavily from the artist’s upcoming comic book, <i>Dr. Nihil and the Tremendous Blunder</i>. The titular character featured in the forthcoming comic plays the video’s main villain. Within the visual, this villain can be seen transforming individuals into his Blackmage followers — when one steps out of line after seeing what will become of him, the villain’s transformed army chases after him until he is caught.</p>
      <p>You can watch the video for “Gatteka” above. Ghostemane has also announced a massive Europe tour for 2020 — full dates can be found <a href="https://www.ghostemane.com/hiadica-euro-tour">here</a>.</p>
