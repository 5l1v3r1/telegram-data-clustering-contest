      <p>Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond is due to appear in court on a series of sexual assault and attempted rape charges.</p>
      <p>The preliminary hearing is to take place at the High Court in Edinburgh on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Mr Salmond faced a total of 14 charges, including two counts of attempted rape, when he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on January 24.</p>
      <p>He has previously denied the allegations and said he will defend himself “to the utmost” in court.</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old was Scotland’s first minister from 2007 to 2014.</p>
      <p>The result of the 2014 referendum – a 55% to 45% vote to stay in the UK – led to him stepping down as first minister and SNP leader.</p>
