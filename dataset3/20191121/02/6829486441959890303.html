      <h1>Lizzo’s Music From 2017 Could Win A 2020 Grammy, Which Isn’t As Weird As It Seems</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:23:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:23</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Rennex</a></address>
      <p>The 2020 Grammy nominations have been announced, and various fandoms are up in arms.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <a href="https://junkee.com/bts-grammy-nomination/231134">BTS fans were outraged</a> over the band being snubbed across the board, while Taylor Swift followers weren’t happy that <i><a href="https://junkee.com/taylor-swift-lover-review/219122">Lover</a> </i>missed out on an Album of the Year nomination.</p>
      <p>But, the biggest point of contention has been Lizzo’s whopping eight Grammy nominations — the most of any artist this year. Lizzo is up for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Best Urban Contemporary Album, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance, Best R&amp;B Performance, and Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance.</p>
      <p>While it’s undeniable that <a href="https://junkee.com/lizzo-truth-hurts/217314">Lizzo has had a mammoth year</a>, people are scratching their heads over her<a href="https://junkee.com/lizzo-truth-hurts/217314"> 2017 hit ‘Truth Hurts’</a> receiving three Grammy nominations.</p>

      <h3>Why The ‘Truth Hurts’</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2020-grammy-awards-complete-nominees-list">Grammys explain</a> that a song is eligible for Song of the Year if it “was first released or if it first achieved prominence during the eligibility year.”</p>
      <p>‘Truth Hurts’ was released in 2017, but didn’t actually gain mainstream attention until 2019. The song charted at number one for seven weeks following a popular TikTok trend and its use in the Netflix film, <i>Someone Great. </i>‘Truth Hurts’ did so well this year that it actually became the tied longest-running number one song by a female rapper.</p>
      <p>But the issue is people aren’t questioning the the songs popularity or whether ‘Truth Hurts’ is a good track, because that’s clear. Instead, people are confused over how a song from 2017 could be nominated at all when this years eligibility period was from October 1st, 2018, to August 31st, 2019.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>‘Truth Hurts’ qualifies for its Grammys nominations because it was actually released on the deluxe edition of Lizzo’s album, <i>Cuz I Love You. </i>The deluxe album, released during the eligibility period, is also the version nominated for Album of the Year.</p>
      <p>This is allowed because ‘Truth Hurts’ was released in 2017 as a standalone single, not as part of an album that was ever <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/awards/8527426/lizzos-truth-hurts-might-still-qualify-at-2020-grammys">Grammy-eligible</a>. Therefore, its inclusion in the deluxe version of her eligible album is totally in line with the Grammy rules.</p>
      <p>As expected, fans are still mad over the songs inclusion, and suggested other artists, songs and albums deserved the same treatment.</p>

      <p>But at the end of the day Lizzo is still leading the nominations, and I guess you just have to blame that on her <i>juice</i>.</p>
