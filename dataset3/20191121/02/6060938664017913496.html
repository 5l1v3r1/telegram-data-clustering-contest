      <p>NEW DELHI: In a bold privatisation move, the government on Wednesday approved strategic stake sale in five PSUs, including fuel retailer Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Shipping Corporation of India, power companies THDCIL and Neepco and logistics firm Concor, a move which will help raise up to Rs 85,000 crore in revenue from just the sale in the three listed entities.</p>
      <p>On October 1, TOI had reported that a panel of secretaries had proposed such a move. Officials said the government could also look at foreign companies to buy stakes in these companies.</p>

        <b>Selloff drive: </b>
        <b>‘In-principle’ nod to cut govt stake below 51% in some PSUs</b>
      </p>
      <p>The cabinet committee on economic affairs, chaired by Prime Minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Modi">Narendra Modi</a> also accorded ‘in-principle’ approval for enabling reduction of the government’s paid-up share capital below 51% in select state-run firms while retaining management control on case to case basis, taking into account the government shareholding, and the shareholding of government-controlled institution. The Centre had announced its intention to go below 51% in state-run companies in the 2019-20 budget.</p>
      <p>The CCEA approved the strategic disinvestment of the government’s shareholding of 53.29% in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (except its equity shareholding of 61.65% in <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/numaligarh-refinery">Numaligarh Refinery</a> Limited (NRL) and management control) along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer. Finance minister <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nirmala-Sitharaman">Nirmala Sitharaman</a> said Numaligarh refinery will remain a PSU.</p>
      <p>The cabinet also approved strategic disinvestment of BPCL's shareholding of 61.65% in NRL along with transfer of management control to a state-run operating in the oil and gas sector. The Centre will also sell its 63.75% holding in Shipping Corporation of India Ltd along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer.</p>
      <p>In Container Corporation of India Ltd, the government will sell 30.8% (out of 54.8% equity presently held by the Centre) along with transfer of management control to a strategic buyer. The Centre will sell its 74.23% holding in THDCIL along with transfer of management control to NTPC and also offload its 100% stake in North Eastern Electric Power Corporation Limited (NEEPCO) to NTPC.</p>
      <p>This move is expected to increase the free float available in the market which may have positive impact on Foreign Portfolio Investments in Indian capital markets and in creation of wider investment space for retail and institutional investors and may increase in the market premium of CPSEs due to likely positive investors perception During its first term, the Modi government had moved slowly on strategic sales after vowing to push through such transactions.</p>
      <p>It had announced its intention to sell its stake in state-run carrier <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Air-India">Air India</a> but had to abort the bid but since then it has revived the process and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had told TOI in an interview last week that the government expects to wrap up the stake sale in Air India and BPCL in the current fiscal year which ends in March.</p>
      <p>The government has set a target of raising Rs 1.05 lakh crore from stake sale in staterun companies in the current fiscal year, including strategic stake sale which means the government will sell a block of shares to a corporate entity and hand over management control.</p>
      <p>The government said the resources unlocked by the strategic disinvestment of these state run companies would be used to finance the social sector and developmental programmes of the Centre benefiting the public.</p>
