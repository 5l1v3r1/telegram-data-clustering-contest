      <h1>'Earthquake Bird': A solid adaptation, but no high flyer</h1>

      <p>Although it passed without much fanfare, this year marked the 30th anniversary of “Black Rain.” Ridley Scott’s Osaka-set cop thriller may have been absurd, but it still ranks as one of the high points in Hollywood’s on-off infatuation with Japan.</p>
      <p>Scott is one of the producers of “Earthquake Bird,” Wash Westmoreland’s more low-key Netflix movie. Taking place in Tokyo in 1989, it even features a cheeky snippet of “Black Rain” that may tempt viewers to watch instead.</p>
      <p>Based on a 2001 novel by former Japan resident Susanna Jones, this is yet another depiction of the country as seen through Western eyes, albeit with a more nuanced perspective than usual. Unlike the culture clashes of “Black Rain” and countless other films, including Netflix’s disastrous “The Outsider” (2018), the non-Japanese protagonist of “Earthquake Bird” is perfectly at home here.</p>

      <p>Lucy (Alicia Vikander) works as a translator and speaks Japanese fluently. She even eats the eyeball of a grilled fish she’s served for breakfast — how much more acclimatized can you get?</p>
      <p>When she’s called in for questioning by police over a friend’s disappearance, her terse responses suggest she has something to hide. All is slowly revealed as the film rewinds to the start of her relationship with Lily (Riley Keough), a garrulous new arrival, who would be unbearable if it weren’t for Keough’s empathetic performance.</p>
      <p>Lucy also recalls how she hooked up with Teiji (Naoki Kobayashi), a mysterious photographer who quickly becomes her lover. He’s tall and dashing, in a serial killer kind of way. They share their first kiss after he shows her photos of his deceased aunt in her coffin — as you do.</p>
      <p>The film could easily have toppled into silliness, especially with lines like, “The first time we saw each other, I knew we could be truthful.” It’s held in check by Vikander’s brittle reserve; even when she’s about to remove her brassiere, she seems tightly buttoned down.</p>
      <p>Much of the actress’s dialogue is in Japanese, and while she never sounds like she can actually speak the language, it’s a convincing effort. Kobayashi’s English line readings are a little stiff, but he has an easy charisma, and his striking presence suggests this won’t be the last time he appears in a Hollywood film.</p>
      <p>What’s missing, though, is chemistry. The sparks only start flying when Lucy introduces Lily to her man; a scene of Keough and Kobayashi dancing together in a club is one of the juiciest in the whole movie.</p>
      <p>As Lily and Teiji’s flirtation gets more serious, Lucy starts to come unravelled. Yet the mystery of whether she ultimately murdered her friend never really grips.</p>
      <p>There’s a choppiness and impatience to the storytelling, with crucial scenes getting dispatched in a cursory fashion. Following recent reports that Netflix has been experimenting with faster playback speeds, Westmoreland seems to be doing the job for them.</p>
      <p>“Earthquake Bird” evokes late-’80s Tokyo by sticking mostly to dowdy interiors and depicting street scenes in such shallow focus that you barely notice the modern signage. Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon takes his cues from Teiji’s photography obsession, constantly framing the characters in mirrors and windows.</p>
      <p>Like many Netflix originals, it applies an art house gloss to what is basically a solid Friday night movie. “Earthquake Bird” is no masterpiece, but at least it’s not “The Outsider.”</p>
