      <h1>Las Vegas man sentenced for killing girlfriend, her daughter</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:04:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/max-michor/" target="_blank">Max Michor</a></address>
      <p>A Las Vegas man was sentenced to life in prison without parole after <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/las-vegas-jury-weighs-death-penalty-for-man-in-2013-killings-1896471/">fatally shooting his girlfriend and her 17-year-old daughter</a> in 2013, as well as critically wounding her 4-year-old daughter.</p>
      <p>Manuel Mata III, 45, was found guilty Monday of second-degree murder in the slaying of Maria Flores, first-degree murder in the death of her daughter Elizabeth Gomez and the attempted murder of Sophia Trujillo, now 11.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the jury was tasked with determining Mata’s sentence for first-degree murder: life in prison or the death penalty.</p>
      <p>“Today is your chance to tell Mr. Mata what justice is,” Chief Deputy District Attorney John Giordani told the jury, “for a mother lost, a daughter lost, a companion, a friend.”</p>
      <p>Mata also faces one count of child abuse and one count of trafficking a controlled substance. He will be sentenced for those charges, as well as the second-degree and attempted murder charges, in January.</p>
      <p>Family, friends and former coworkers testified to Mata’s strong work ethic and love for his family.</p>
      <p>Melida Pulido, a family friend of Mata, said he was a loving man who cared for his extended family and helped look after her aging parents.</p>
      <p>“I don’t have a big circle of friends that I trust in my home — many acquaintances — but Manny is one that has always been, and will always be, trusted in my home with my children, around my family,” Pulido said.</p>
      <p>Mata’s attorneys, David Schieck and Gary Modafferi, argued that he served an important role as a father and mentor to many people. They said that by sparing his life, the jury would allow Mata to continue to be a positive influence for his family.</p>
      <p>Several family members, <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/las-vegas-jurors-deliberate-double-murder-suspects-fate-1893751/">including his daughter, who was home during the shooting but was not injured</a>, said they had stayed and would continue to stay in contact with Mata while he was imprisoned.</p>
      <p>“Someone once said that murderers are not monsters, they’re just men, and that’s the frightening thing about them,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Marc DiGiacomo told jurors during closing arguments.</p>
      <p>The state argued that Mata should recieve the death penalty because of the violent nature of the shooting, regardless of his relationships.</p>
      <p>“I can’t imagine there’s any mitigation for someone who killed two people and shot a 4-year-old,” DiGiacomo said. “He’s supposedly a father figure, and he takes a shotgun to a 17-year-old person who’s supposed to be his daughter. And that’s mitigation?”</p>
      <p>When the verdict was read, one juror included a written-in mitigating factor to support their decision:</p>
      <p>“See the good in people and forgive.”</p>
