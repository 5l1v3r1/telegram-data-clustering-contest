      <h1>Our Selfish Saturday Festival Is Coming To Melbs So Time To Love Thyself</h1>

        <a href="https://www.pedestrian.tv/health/selfish-saturday-festival-melbourne/pedestrian.tv/sefish">PEDESTRIAN.TV X Selfish Saturday presented by The House of Angostura is here to give you the self-care you need - hold the wank factor. Early bird tix on sale now.</a>
      </p>
      <p>After the success of PEDESTRIAN.TV’s Selfish Weekend presented by The House of Angostura in Sydney earlier this year, we’re bringing the only self-care festival that matters down to Melbourne on February 22, 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="http://pedestrian.tv/selfish">Selfish Saturday</a> will give punters the entire day to be, well, selfish. Ignore everyone else, this day’s about your own physical and mental health, and yours only.</p>
      <p>The single-day event will go down at Port Melbourne’s The Timber Yard which, if you’ve never been, is a bloody huge indoor and outdoor venue that can hold up to 1,500 soul-searchers.</p>
      <p>That’s a whole lotta people finally looking after themselves – my little heart is filled with happiness.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the launch, we’ll be giving away 20 double passes to the event (and if you miss out on the free double passes, you can get the early bird tix for a mere $45).</p>
      <p>For a chance to win, just tell us in 25 words or less, what’s the best thing you’ve ever done for yourself:</p>

      <p>There are a few familiar faces from the last P.TV X House Of Angostura Selfish fest, including manifestation kween Flex Mami, and we’ve also added some cracking new talent to the partially-announced line-up.</p>
      <p>It’s all still <i>very </i>hush-hush, but here’s just a taster of what you can expect on the day:</p>

      <p>Because it <i>is </i>still a festival, there will also be multiple bars with alcoholic and non-alcoholic bevs, more food than you can get your grubby mitts on and, of course, a stage for the slew of musos belting out their bangers.</p>
      <p>The line-up of musicians is still under lock and key, so just keep sitting on the edge of your seat (seriously, don’t move) until they’re announced.</p>
      <p>Early bird tickets will be going on sale shortly for $45, keeping in mind that every ticket gets you a bangin’ gift bag worth $100.</p>
      <p>Watch this (safe) space.</p>
