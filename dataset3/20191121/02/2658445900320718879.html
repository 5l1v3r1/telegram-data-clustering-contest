      <p>The Lagos State government says it has directed relevant agencies to review traffic control and regulation policies, toward identifying a long-lasting solution to the perennial traffic gridlocks in the state.</p>
      <p>The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Gbenga Omotoso, said in a statement on Wednesday, that government would surmount the challenges with technology and enforcement of traffic rules.</p>
      <p>Omotoso said that the government was aware of the discomfort commuters and motorists had experienced since the beginning of the massive road repairs under ‘Operation 116’ across the state.</p>
      <p>The commissioner, who said that there was no deliberate action to cause Lagosians any pain, added that the present situation was temporary.</p>
      <p>According to him, the contractors are speeding up their jobs and they are being encouraged to work at night, where possible.</p>
      <p>He advised motorists to use alternative routes so as to ease the time and stress of staying in traffic.</p>

      <p>”The administration sympathises with residents on the inconvenience being suffered daily.</p>
      <p>”In fulfillment of its commitment to making the roads motorable immediately the rains subside, resources and equipment have been deployed to fix degenerated roads. The discomfort will be short-lived.</p>
      <p>”The daily influx of people from other parts of the country into Lagos has contributed to the big human and vehicular pressure on the roads.</p>
      <p>”Government will surely surmount the challenges with technology and enforcement of traffic rules.</p>
      <p>”Government appreciates the perseverance of Lagosians and pledges its commitment to pooling all its resources together to achieve a permanent solution to the problem posed by the rehabilitation of bad roads.</p>
      <p>”The administration will ensure that majority of the roads become smooth and motorable before the Yuletide,” he said.</p>
