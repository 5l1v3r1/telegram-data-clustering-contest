      <p><b>Washington:</b> The Trump Administration has notified to the US Congress its determination to sell $1 billion worth of naval guns to India for use against warships, anti-aircraft and shore bombardment, in a move that would enhance the lethal capabilities of the Indian Navy.</p>
      <p>The proposed foreign military sale of up to 13 MK-45 5inch/62 caliber (MOD 4) naval guns and related equipment is at an estimated cost of $1.02 billion, Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in its notification to the Congress on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>To be manufactured by the BAE Systems Land and Armaments, the proposed sale will improve India’s capability to meet current and future threats from enemy weapon systems, the notification said.</p>
      <p>“The MK-45 Gun System will provide the capability to conduct anti-surface warfare and anti-air defence missions while enhancing interoperability with US and other allied forces,” the notification said.</p>
      <p>India will use the enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen its homeland defence, it said.</p>
      <p>The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region, it said.</p>
      <p>According to the notification, this notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded.</p>
      <p>With this, India has become one of the few countries that the US decided to sell its latest version (Mod 4) of its naval guns.</p>
      <p>The other countries to have been sold with MOD 4 naval guns so far are Australia, Japan and South Korea. The one given to Thailand is an upgraded MOD 4 version. The US has also determined to sell these to a few other allies and friends including Britain and Canada.</p>
