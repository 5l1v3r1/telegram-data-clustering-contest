      <h2>Idris Elba is a wasp species. Why was it named after the actor?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:22:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, British actor Idris Elba stars as Heimdall. The character has an almost namesake: Heimdallr, a Norse deity believed to be the sole protector of the bridge linking the human world and the realm of the gods. Now, scientists have given the name Idris elba to a species of wasp that is again a protector — of crops.</p>
      <p>The wasp, recently discovered in Mexico, was found living as a parasite in the eggs of another insect, known as the bagrada bug, which is a major pest of cruciferous vegetables.</p>
      <p>In fact, the genus Idris already exists, having been described in 1856. It now contains over 300 species, including the newest one discovered and given the species name elba.</p>
      <p>While other species of the Idris genus were known to only parasitise spider eggs, specimens of Idris elba have now been found to emerge from eggs of the bagrada bug.</p>
      <p>The species is described in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research. The research team comprised scientists from Colegio de Postgraduados (Mexico), Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Florida State Collection of Arthropods.</p>
