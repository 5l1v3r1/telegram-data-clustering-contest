      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tayla Simpson</a></address>
      <p>Moree Secondary College ancient history students are continuing their fundraising to get to Greece and Italy in 2020.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/5962205/history-students-bound-for-europe-to-experience-ancient-worlds-first-hand/">fundraising for the ancient history Europe excursion kicked off earlier this year</a>, with a <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/5981729/pizza-and-pasta-day-a-delicious-success-photos/">successful pizza and pasta day</a>.</p>
      <p>This time the students, with the help of the community and teachers, will be running a Christmas raffle.</p>
      <p>There are a number of amazing prizes up from grabs, including a $100 voucher from 61 Balo, $100 worth of beauty products, $100 Lorraine Lea linen pack, $35 MK Seafoods voucher and one ham from South Moree Butchery, $35 MK Seafoods voucher and one ham from Reado's Meats, $30 voucher from Deluxe Cafe Moree, two $28 vouchers from Stag and Co, $30 Slyvia's fabric voucher, two $50 magazine hampers and more.</p>
      <p>Tickets are only $2 and are available at Hardman Outdoors, Ruby Soles, Westpac, Moree East Public School, Moree Secondary College (MSC), the Jellicoe Park Christmas markets, the Christmas at Twilight event and other businesses around town.</p>
      <p>The MSC students who are going on the Europe excursion next year have said that they would love if everyone could help and support them, with the excursion to cost $6,300 per student. Multiple students have already withdrawn from the excursion because their families can't afford it due to the drought.</p>
      <p>Student Grace Carter said that's why the fundraiser is so important. She said anything raised counts and helps them to pay for the excursion.</p>
      <p>"[The fundraiser] decreases our price," Grace said.</p>
      <p>"Help us out as much as possible. Anything counts."</p>
      <p>All profits made from this cause worthy fundraiser will go towards reducing the cost of the excursion, helping to reduce stress for students and their families.</p>
      <p>"It's less on mum because most of our parents are coming, so less stress," Isabella O'Neile said.</p>
      <p>"Buy tickets," Brennan Cumberland added.</p>
      <p>The students are also planning other fundraisers, including a Mother's Day raffle with a few of the prizes including Lorraine Lea and beauty products and also a Lorraine Lea fundraiser.</p>
      <p>Everyone at MSC, especially those attending the excursion would greatly appreciate any support whether it be big or small.</p>
      <p>The raffle will be drawn on Monday, December 16.</p>
