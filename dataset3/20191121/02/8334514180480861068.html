      <p>HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Thursday he was unaware of any plans to withdraw 4,000 U.S. troops from South Korea if talks on cost-sharing fail.</p>
      <p>“I have not heard that,” Esper said during a trip to Vietnam when asked about a report in South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo.</p>
      <p>“I read articles in the media all the time that are false or inaccurate or overstated,” he said.</p>
      <p>Asked if there was any threat to withdraw U.S. forces from South Korea if talks failed, Esper said: “We’re not threatening allies over this. This is a negotiation.”</p>
