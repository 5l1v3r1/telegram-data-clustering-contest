      <p>NEW DELHI: A draft legislation seeking up to 10-year imprisonment for those who assault doctors and other healthcare professionals may be placed before the Union Cabinet and introduced in the current session of Parliament.</p>
      <p>The Health Services Personnel and Clinical Establishments (<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Prohibition-of-Violence">Prohibition of Violence</a> and Damage of Property) Bill also proposes to impose a fine of ?10 lakh on those who assault healthcare personnel.</p>
      <p>The health ministry, which put out the draft law for public feedback in September, received over 250 comments from stakeholders, and has decided to widen the scope to include clinical psychologists and organ transplant coordinators.</p>
      <p>“Most comments were in support of the draft legislation. We have included clinical psychologists and organ transplant coordinators under its ambit, too. It was felt important to have them covered under the legislation since both categories have active interface with patients,” said a senior health ministry official. As per the bill, healthcare professionals will include doctors, dentists, nurses and para-medical staff, medical students, diagnostic service providers in a health facility and even ambulance drivers.</p>
      <p>The need for legislation was felt after a retired 73-year-old doctor was lynched by a mob at a tea estate in Assam because he was not present when a worker died at the estate hospital. In June, resident doctors across the country held protests and went on strike against a brutal attack on their colleagues by the relatives of a patient who died during treatment in West <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Bengal">Bengal</a>.</p>
      <p>At that time, health minister Harsh Vardhan wrote to the chief ministers to consider enacting legislation for protecting doctors and medical professionals.</p>
      <p>According to the bill, those committing violence or causing damage to the property of a healthcare facility can be imprisoned for six months to five years and fined between Rs 50,000 and Rs 5 lakh.</p>
      <p>The bill defines violence as an act that causes any kind of hurt, intimidation, obstruction or endangers the life of any healthcare service personnel in discharge of duty within the premises of a healthcare facility.</p>
