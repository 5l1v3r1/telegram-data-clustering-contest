      <h1>Eva Marcille Says She Totally Predicted Porsha Wiliams And Dennis McKinley Would Reunite!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T02:35:49+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 02:35</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Eva Marcille was apparently not very surprised when she learned that her Real Housewives of Atlanta co-star Porsha Williams ended up reuniting with Dennis McKinley! During a new interview, the reality TV star explained why she predicted that the pair would get back together.</p>
      <p>While spits and reunions happen all the time in reality TV as well as in real life, Porsha and Dennis’ breakup was pretty shocking since it happened only three months after the two welcomed their precious baby girl, Pilar Jhena.</p>
      <p>Allegedly, what caused their jarring separation was Dennis admitting during a therapy session that he’d cheated on Porsha!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, she was seven months pregnant at the time he betrayed her so it makes sense the RHOA star proceeded to leave him.</p>
      <p>While at BravoCon, Eva chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the news outlet about the fact that another of their co-star was surprised to find out Porsha took Dennis back after he did that to her.</p>
      <p>As for her, Eva admitted she was not as shook by the news since she actually expected it!</p>
      <p>After all, Dennis and her husband Michael Sterling are close friends so that meant having some insight into Dennis and Porsha’s relationship.</p>
      <p>‘I always predicted they will be back together. My husband is really good friends with Dennis despite how it seems in the media and how crazy it was in real life. He loves her and I think they are meant to be. And so it was really funky for a while and it happened at a time where everybody was able to see it. But I knew when the dust cleared and the sun rose, they’d be okay,’ Eva told the site.</p>

      <p>As for the other Housewife who was totally surprised to find out about the reunion, it was Kandi Burrus!</p>
      <p>She told HollywoodLife earlier this month that ‘At first when we started the season, [Porsha] was so done. But everyone could figure it out, I guess, especially when they have a beautiful baby.’</p>
