        <b>The fifth Democratic debate is set to start on Wednesday at 9 pm local time in Atlanta, Georgia. Former Vice President Joe Biden is expected to appear onstage along with other 9 presidential candidates.</b>
      </p>
      <p>US Presidential Hopeful Joe Biden's supporters, however, received an email from the Biden campaign asking for donations, some six hours before the debate.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m leaving the fifth Democratic debate now. I hope I made you proud out there and I hope I made it clear to the world why our campaign is so important", the email said.</blockquote>

      <p>About an hour later, Biden aides sent a follow-up message, campaigning off the mistake, asking supporters to donate for reaching a $90,000 fundraising goal before the debate commences.</p>
      <blockquote>“You might have just gotten an email from Joe about just getting off of the debate stage. That’s our bad, team [...] We know Joe is going to make us proud tonight. We were just so excited for it that we accidentally hit send too soon”, Biden's team said in the 'oops' email.</blockquote>

      <p>Biden <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911181077344235-nearly-half-of-us-voters-want-trump-impeachment-probe-extended-to-bidens---poll/">is thought be some to be engulfed</a> in political scandal, after the whistleblower complaint alleging that US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the 25 July phone call had discussed an alleged quid-pro-quo in which Biden's and his son Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine would be investigated for corruption in exchange for the release of previously allocated military aid.</p>
      <p>The whistleblower complaint alleges that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201911171077333170-trump-steps-in-to-defend-biden-from-north-korean-media-branding-ex-vice-president-rabid-dog/">Trump pressured</a> Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. House Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry after the complaint claimed that Trump had abused the power of the office.</p>
      <p>The White House subsequently released what it had described as a declassified transcript of the entire phone call, with Trump insisting that there was no quid-pro-quo in his dealings with the Ukrainian president. Trump has also repeatedly <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201911161077320599-marie-yovanovitch-obama-administration-preparing-her-address-bidens/">slammed the impeachment inquiry</a> as a political witch hunt by Democrats aimed at reversing the result of the 2016 presidential election.</p>
