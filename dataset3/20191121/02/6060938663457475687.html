      <p>MUMBAI: The BCCI’s plans of bringing out a tender for two new <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl">IPL</a> teams from 2020 onwards are now on the backburner. Reports now suggest that the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bcci">BCCI</a> wants to just introduce just one new franchise early next year.</p>
      <p>Instead of 10 teams, the IPL could now have just nine until the year 2022 and the reasons are manifold.</p>
      <p>Importantly, they lack a window to host 90-plus matches at the moment. Owing to the current <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Future-Tours-Programme">Future Tours Programme</a> (FTP) of the ICC – a nine-team IPL will allow the tournament to have 76 matches for which the existing window can be stretched.</p>
      <p>“Nine teams work well until a new FTP can fall in place (2023) and BCCI can introduce the 10th team,” sources say.</p>
      <p>Second, the BCCI is contemplating a base price of somewhere around US$300m (approx. Rs 2000 crore) for the new franchise and is clearly unsure at this moment if more than one venue will attract that kind of investment in the prevailing market.</p>
      <p>“There are buyers. That’s not the point. But are there enough buyers coming to the table where bidding can be a competitive process? For one franchise, yes. For two, let’s see,” sources add.</p>
      <p>Third, as TOI understands, the Sardar Patel Stadium in Motera, Ahmedabad, is getting ready and could be available for cricket from the month of March this year. For a 1.1 lakh-capacity venue, one that will go on to become the biggest and fanciest cricket stadium in the world, not having a franchise of its own will make little sense.</p>
      <p>“There will be takers, given the following for cricket in Ahmedabad and the resources available there. So, if a tender is brought out for one franchise right now, there’ll certainly be great amount of interest and will set a benchmark for the future,” say those in the know.</p>
      <p>The BCCI has several other prickly issues to address before it can introduce the 10th team.</p>
      <p>There is the ‘awkward’ position the cricket board finds itself in with regards to Kochi Tuskers, who have to be paid in excess of Rs 1500 crore (going by the arbitration result). The ongoing arbitration with the terminated Deccan Chargers franchise, one that is being led by ICICI bank, is in its final round of conclusion; another arbitration is on with another terminated franchise, Sahara Warriors, which was based out of Pune.</p>
      <p>“Will Kochi Tuskers be offered money or a franchise? It’s a big question. Regardless of whether BCCI is in a strong position in some cases or on the backfoot on some, the point is that legal cases are on and smoothly settling them before beginning afresh is the right thing to do,” sources add.</p>
      <p>A final call is expected to be taken during the AGM on December 1.</p>
