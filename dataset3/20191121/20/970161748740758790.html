      <p>X-Factor co-winner <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/myles-stephenson/">Myles Stephenson</a> is in the middle of his first week on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/myles-stephenson-wins-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-according-to-psychic-11168199/">a psychic predicted that he’ll be the winner</a> before he even entered the jungle.</p>
      <p>Psychic Chris Riley said he feels ‘very drawn’ to the Rak-Su member, who has been appearing on the reality TV show since Sunday night.</p>
      <p>While we wait to see whether or not this psychic’s prediction is correct, here’s what we know about whether anyone’s been, erm, drawn to him in a different way lately.</p>
      <h3>Does Myles Stephenson have a girlfriend?</h3>
      <p>Rak-Su singer Myles does not seem to be dating anyone at the moment, which is understandable given that he’s newly single and currently in the middle of the Australian jungle.</p>
      <p>Myles, 28, previously dated Love Island 2017 alum <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/happened-im-celebritys-myles-stephenson-love-islands-gabby-allen-11171785/">Gabby Allen</a>, 27, from September 2018 until August 2019.</p>
      <p>They’d moved in together at the start of 2019, however it seems their relationship was not meant to be, as their split came amid claims that Myles had been unfaithful.</p>

      <p>Gabby previously announced their split by telling her 1.1 million Instagram followers: ‘The newspaper articles are true. I am no longer in a relationship. I hope youse (sic) have all had a better week than me! If anyone else has anything they need to tell me, please do.’</p>

      <p>In April 2018, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-myles-stephenson-will-tell-jacqueline-jossa-everything-husband-dans-connection-gabby-allen-11194175/">Dan Osborne was seen on holiday with Gabby</a>. Dan has been married to Myles’ fellow I’m A Celebrity contestant Jacqueline Jossa since 2017 but they briefly split after Dan was spotted with the former-islander.</p>
      <p>A source has now told The Sun that Myles will be up for telling Jacqueline ‘everything’ she might want to know.</p>
      <p>The source said: ‘Myles would be willing to tell Jacqueline everything – and answer any questions she might have.</p>
      <p>‘Myles will tell Jacqueline everything Gabby told him. It’s a good thing Gabby’s gone to Thailand for a month because she might find it uncomfortable watching.’</p>
      <p>
        <i>Representatives for Dan declined to comment further.</i>
