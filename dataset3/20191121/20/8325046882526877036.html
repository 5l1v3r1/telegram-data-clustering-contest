      <p>The Victoria’s Secret fashion show, which has aired annually around the holidays since 1995, is officially canceled this year.</p>
      <p>The lingerie brand’s parent company, L Brands, confirmed the fate of the iconic show in an earnings call on Thursday.</p>
      <p>In response to a question about how the company planned to make up for the publicity that typically accompanied the show, Stuart Burgdoerfer, L Brands’ chief financial officer, said it would “be communicating to customers, but nothing that I would say is similar in magnitude to the fashion show.”</p>
      <p>“Did we see specific material impact on short-term sales response to the airing of the fashion show? As a general matter, the answer to that question is no,” Burgdoerfer said. “So if you’re like, ‘Oh my God, Stuart, are you freaked out about the day-after-the-fashion-show result and what’s going to happen?’ it did air at different times over the years, and we didn’t see a material impact on the next few days’ results.”</p>
      <p>The annual fashion show featuring top models – called “angels” – wearing lingerie has seen a severe decline in viewership over the past several years. Last year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-fashion-show-2018-viewership-drops-2018-12">3.3 million people tuned in</a> to watch the show, down from 9.7 million viewers in 2013.</p>
      <p>A Victoria’s Secret model, Shanina Shaik, <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a28552245/victoria-secret-fashion-show-2019-canceled-shanina-shaik-interview/">said in July</a> that the lingerie brand had canceled this year’s fashion show. The company refused to comment on or confirm her remark at the time.</p>
      <p>L Brands said in May that it was thinking about <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/victorias-secret-might-kill-fashion-show-report-2019-5">making changes</a> to the annual fashion show, but it didn’t say whether it would be outright canceled.</p>
      <p>CEO Les Wexner said in a memo to employees that the company didn’t think “network television is the right fit” for the show.</p>
      <p>He said the company was rethinking “literally everything” about its business and focusing on “developing exciting and dynamic content and a new kind of event – delivered to our customers on platforms that she’s glued to.”</p>
