      <h1>BMWBLOG Podcast Episode 6 — Horatiu Joins to Talk BMW M2 CS and i4</h1>
      <h2>We just finished our first press day of the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show and as always, we’ve stuck behind for extra coverage. And of …</h2>

      <p>Our latest episode of the<a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/14/bmwblog-podcast-episode-5-test-drives-bmw-m8-m235i-and-rolls/"> BMWBLOG Podcast</a> is live. It’s actually been live for a couple of days now and we apologize for any delays. We’ve been at the <a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2019/11/21/2019-la-auto-show-2020-audi-s8-bmw-m760i-competitor/">LA Auto Show</a> this week and been trying our hardest to bring you all the best content we can and will continue to do so. In this latest episode, Horatiu joins me to talk about some of the hottest BMW topics, including the BMW <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5HYXWkgBYv/">M2</a> CS</p>
      <p>We obviously talk about the M2 CS, as it’s probably the hottest BMW to debut in a long time. Even though we recorded this episode prior to the LA Auto Show, the M2 CS was absolutely the brand’s biggest hit in LA. And I’ve been a bit of a critic of the M2 CS’ design, for not looking different enough from the standard car, I must say it looks great in person. Especially in Misano Blue.</p>

      <p>But we also talk some other interesting cars. For instance, we talk about the upcoming BMW i4, which will be the brand’s all-electric sedan to take on cars like the Tesla Model 3. There’s very little by the way of official information on the i4 but we do have some. Horatiu has some good insider info on the i4 and what it’s going to be, so he breaks it down and gives us the scoop in this episode.</p>
      <p>We also talk about one of the most iconic cars in the history of the brand, if not the very most iconic — the E30 BMW M3. It’s a car that almost all enthusiasts know of and it’s one that almost all enthusiasts want to own. It can be tricky to own, because it’s very expensive, but we talk about some of the reasons why you should buy one if you can afford it.</p>

      <p>So please have a listen and we hope you enjoy it. Next week, we’re going to have a very special episode for you, as we recorded some of it live at the LA Auto Show and BMW M CEO Markus Flasch was gracious enough to sit down and talk to us. Don’t worry, the BMW M2 CS came up… So stay tuned for that next week.</p>
