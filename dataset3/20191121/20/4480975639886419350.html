      <h1>ECB’s Luis de Guindos: Recession in euro area is ‘very improbable’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:20:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/ross-j-burland" target="_blank">Ross J Burland</a></address>
      <p>European Central Bank’s Luis de Guindos has been crossing the wires, saying a recession in the euro-area is ‘very improbable’.</p>
      <h3>Additional comments:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Euro-area economic risks still tilted to downside.</li>
        <li>Important that fiscal policy takes an increasing role.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>FX implications: </h4>
      <p>There was little from the Vice President today, although yesterday, markets took on board comments from the VP that ECB interest rates are not yet close to the so-called reversal rate, "where low rates actually hamper the banking sector rather than stimulate lending", ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos said.</p>
      <p>"The negative side effects of the ECB's ultra-loose policy are nevertheless becoming more evident and require monitoring", de Guindos told a news conference.</p>
      <p>What this means is following the cut to its deposit rate to a record low minus 0.5% in September, there is still scope for a further cut next year – that is bearish for <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a>. Moreover, according to the latest Reuters poll, a majority of economists believe that the new <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/ecb">European Central Bank</a> (ECB) President Lagarde will follow policies adopted by former President Draghi.<br/> </p>
