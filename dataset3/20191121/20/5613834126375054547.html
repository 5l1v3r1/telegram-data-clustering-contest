      <p>Documenting the trial of Michael Peterson, convicted of murdering his wife,<b> “The Staircase”</b> originally began as a French miniseries that was then expanded upon with a Netflix docuseries several years later – you can stream every single episode through Netflix – and it’s next getting a scripted adaptation for a possible series starring <b>Harrison Ford</b>, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/harrison-ford-the-staircase-series-1203411141/">Variety</a> reports.</p>
      <p>The site notes, “The project is currently being shopped to networks and streaming services,” with Ford attached to both star (as Peterson, we assume) and executive produce.</p>
      <p>The docuseries is titled “The Staircase” because Peterson claims his wife Kathleen fell down the stairs in their home, though many believe he actually bludgeoned her to death.</p>
      <p><b>Antonio Campos</b> is set to write and executive produce the series for Annapurna Television.</p>
