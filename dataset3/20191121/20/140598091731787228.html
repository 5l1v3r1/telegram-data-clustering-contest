      <h1>Hollie Doyle joins hundred club on The Perfect Crown at Chelmsford</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:07:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/marcus-armytage/" target="_blank">Marcus Armytage</a></address>
      <p>Hollie Doyle became the third female jockey to ride 100 winners in a calendar year when she partnered The Perfect Crown to a wide margin victory in the Novice Median Auction Stakes at Chelmsford on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Perfect Crown is trained by Lambourn trainer Archie Watson, for whom it was her 41st winner. She had already broken through the £1 million prize-money barrier but now joins Hayley Turner and Josephine Gordon as the only females in the century club. Ninety minutes later, she added her 101st winner aboard the David Elsworth-trained Lady Dancealot.</p>
      <p>Doyle, who was apprenticed to David Evans and then Richard Hannon, now has Gordon’s record, of 106 set in 2017, in her sights and has five weeks in which to ride a further six winners.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bit of relief,” she said. “People have been talking about it for a while and there were a few weeks when I wondered if it would happen, and luckily it has. I take everything as it comes but I am riding here until the end of the year so, with regard to the record, I’ll see how it goes but I’ll definitely be trying for it.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Ireland, Footpad, an unbeaten novice the season before last, looked somewhere near back to his best when he beat Mala Beach 10 lengths in the Bommerang.ie Chase over two and three-quarter miles at Thurles.</p>
      <p>The Willie Mullins-trained seven-year-old won the 2018 Arkle by 14 lengths from Brain Power under an exhibition ride from Ruby Walsh, who had let Saint Calvados and Petit Mouchoir cut each other’s throats out in front.</p>
      <p>Last season, however, Footpad fell first time out at Naas; looked to have Leopardstown’s Grade One two-mile chase in the bag last Christmas only to be caught on the line by Simply Ned and then bled on his last start.</p>
      <p>Daryl Jacob, who flew over to Ireland to ride him for owners Simon Munir and Isaac Souede, said: “He jumped and travelled very well. It was a great starting point for him. He never missed a beat and it’s good to see him back.”</p>
      <p>It was the start of what could be a good couple of days for Jacob. Tomorrow, he will don the same silks for Bristol De Mai as he attempts to win a third Betfair Chase at Haydock. The Nigel Twiston-Davies chaser faces just three rivals in what is the first Grade One prize of the National Hunt season: up-and-coming Lostintranslation, Ryanair Chase winner Frodon and his stable companion Ballyoptic.</p>
