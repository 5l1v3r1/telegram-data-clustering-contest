      <p>SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court has rejected a state law that would have required President Donald Trump to disclose his tax returns to appear on the state's primary ballot.<br/><br/>Justices said Thursday the law requiring candidates for president and governor to disclose financial information was unconstitutional.<br/><br/><b><a href="https://abc7.com/politics/ca-lawmakers-pass-bill-requiring-trump-to-release-tax-returns/5389210/">RELATED: CA lawmakers pass bill requiring Trump, presidential candidates to release tax returns</a></b><br/><br/>A federal judge had temporarily blocked the state law in response to a different lawsuit and the high court ruled quickly because the deadline for submitting tax returns to get on the primary ballot is next week.<br/><br/>The state Republican Party and Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson challenged the bill signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom because it was aimed at Trump.<br/><br/>The state defended the law, saying tax returns are a simple way for voters to weigh candidates' financial status.</p>
