      <p>Saint-Maximin has become something of a cult hero already at St. James’ Park for his flamboyant style on the pitch.</p>
      <p>The French winger, who joined for a reported £16.5 million, was wowed with his dribbling and speed, and he helped himself to his first assist against Bournemouth before the international break.</p>
      <p>Fans are excited to see how he’ll develop as the season goes on, but he’s certainly made a bright start in games.</p>

      <p>And Atsu has suggested he is just as lively in training.</p>
      <p>When asked who the nutmeg king was, he said: “Allan [Saint-Maximin]. This guy is a joke in training. He is very technical, he enjoys the game and he is a fantastic player.”</p>
      <p>Atsu also revealed Saint-Maximin as the player who picks up the most fines for being late.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Newcastle’s danger man</h3>
      <p>It sounds like Saint-Maximin just loves to be a flamboyant maverick at all times.</p>

      <p>The star has gotten off to a great start at the club and is already adored by the fans.</p>
      <p>It’s on him now to start delivering in terms of goals and assists.</p>
      <p>He is most definitely Newcastle’s danger man right now, and he will be a total force once he brings his end product up to scratch.</p>
