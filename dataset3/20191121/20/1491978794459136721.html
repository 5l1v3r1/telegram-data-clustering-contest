      <h1>China is seeking to 'take over' Australia's political system, former Asio chief claims</h1>

        <i>Duncan Lewis says Chinese authorities are using espionage and foreign interference to gain influence</i>
      </p>
      <p>The retired Asio chief Duncan Lewis has reportedly warned that the Chinese government is seeking to use “insidious” foreign interference operations to “take over” Australia’s political system.</p>
      <p>Anyone in office could be a target and the strategy’s full impact might not be apparent for decades, Lewis is reported to have told the political journal Quarterly Essay.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/insidious-former-asio-boss-warns-on-chinese-interference-in-australia-20191121-p53cv2.html">The Sydney Morning Herald reports</a> that Lewis also says members of Australia’s Chinese community need to come forward to help Asio and other agencies, as local Muslims have in identifying terrorist threats.</p>
      <p>Chinese authorities are trying to “place themselves in a position of advantage” by winning influence in political, social, business and media circles, Lewis said.</p>
      <p>“Espionage and foreign interference is insidious,” he said. “Its effects might not present for decades and by that time it’s too late.</p>
      <p>“You wake up one day and find decisions made in our country that are not in the interests of our country.”</p>
      <p>Lewis, who retired in September, was the director general of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation for five years.</p>
      <p>In the forthcoming Quarterly Essay interview, the Herald says, he warns that covert foreign intrusion into the heart of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-politics">Australian politics</a> is “something we need to be very, very careful about”.</p>
      <p>His remarks follow claims by the senior Chinese diplomat Wang Xining that the MPs Andrew Hastie and Senator James Paterson have shown no respect for his country.</p>
      <p>The pair have been banned from travelling there.</p>
      <p>“It is cynical that in a country boasting freedom of speech, different views from another nation are constantly and intentionally obliterated,” Wang wrote in an opinion piece in the Australian on Thursday.</p>
      <p>“Understanding truth succumbs to being politically right. A people said to be audacious and adventurous like kangaroos are scared of stepping out of the comfort zone of ideas and thinking.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this week the former prime ministers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/tony-abbott">Tony Abbott</a> and Paul Keating also weighed in on China.</p>
      <p>Abbott accused <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> of bullying its neighbours and warned that Australia’s relations with it were unlikely to rise above a “cold peace”.</p>
      <p>In a speech to the India Foundation in New Delhi, Abbott promised to champion further engagement with India, suggesting that Australia had “put too many eggs into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> basket”.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/18/paul-keating-lambasts-australias-security-agencies-and-pious-media-for-anti-china-rhetoric">Keating suggested on Monday</a> that Australia’s approach to China has been supplanted by the phobias of security agencies and the hysteria of “pious” and “do-gooder” journalists.</p>
      <p>He said the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/australia-media">Australian media</a> had been “up to its ears” in drumming up anti-China hysteria. He singled out the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, but also criticised the Australian.</p>
      <p>The media wrongly equated the actions of individual businessmen or universities with the acts of the entire Chinese state, he said.</p>
      <p>The long-term national interest should guide Australia’s approach to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a>, Keating said, not “pious”, “do-gooder” journalists who were “fed on leaks” from security agencies and failed to appreciate the magnitude of the shifting dynamics in the region.</p>
      <p>“The Australian media has been recreant in its duty to the public in failing to present a balanced picture of the rise and legitimacy and importance of China, preferring instead to traffic in side plays dressed up with the cosmetics of sedition and risk.”</p>
      <p>Keating, who championed Australian engagement in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/asia-pacific">Asia Pacific</a> as prime minister, said the US had ceded influence and withdrawn from the region as it returned to an “America-first” posture.</p>
      <p>He said Australia must adopt strategic realism in its approach to China and not force upon itself a choice of one great power over the other.</p>
