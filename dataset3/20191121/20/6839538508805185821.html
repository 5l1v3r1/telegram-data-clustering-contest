      <p>A man is in hospital with facial fractures while another has been charged after a fistfight in the city.</p>
      <p>Members of the public and security rushed to the injured manâ€™s aid and performed CPR on North Tce outside Roma Mitchell House, opposite the Adelaide Railway Station, about 11.50pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Both men, who did not appear to know each other, had exchanged words before punches were thrown, witnesses said.</p>
      <p>The man had fractures to his face and was taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital where he remained in a stable condition. Police will speak to him once his condition improves.</p>
      <p>A Northfield man, 26, was arrested and charged with fighting in a public place.</p>
      <p>He was bailed to appear in the Adelaide Magistrates Court in January and issued with a three-month barring order.</p>
