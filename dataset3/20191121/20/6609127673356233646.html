        <b>A UNIVERSITY student who coaches a kids' football team could be jailed after he was caught with cocaine worth nearly £1,000.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shaun Grady, 22, has been left with a criminal record after being found with the class A drug, and hundreds of pounds in cash, in a car in his home town of Paisley, near Glasgow.</p>

      <p>And Grady, who attends Glasgow Caledonian University, could lose his university education, his job and his career if sent to prison after admitting a drug dealing charge.</p>
      <p>Uniformed police officers on patrol in the town spotted Grady near the vehicle and went to investigate.</p>
      <p>They found he had three bags of cocaine in his trouser pocket - and more in the back of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>The details emerged when trainee quantity surveyor Grady appeared in the dock at Paisley Sheriff Court for a pre-trial hearing.</p>
      <p>He was also accused of dealing powdered ecstasy, which is more commonly known as MDMA, but struck a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty to a charge of being concerned in the supply of cocaine.</p>
      <p>Procurator Fiscal Depute Keri Marshall told the court that Grady was caught with the drug in Maxwellton Road, Paisley, on December 8 last year.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor explained: "The accused Grady directed police witnesses to his left trouser pocket, and three bags were recovered.</p>
      <p>"The car was searched and, again, the accused Grady directed police [officers] to two blue bags on the rear seat of the car."</p>
      <p>One of the bags contained 16.5g of cocaine, while other bags were found to contain 0.67g, 0.77g and 0.4g of the drug.</p>
      <p>Officers also found £170.90 in cash in the centre console of the vehicle, a further £430 in mixed notes in the glove box, and two mobile phones.</p>
      <p>Miss Marshall told Sheriff David Pender that officers also found digital scales, unused polythene bags and a small toffee hammer.</p>
      <p>And she said the cocaine found in the bags was worth around £280 if sold in 1g deals for £40 each, while the 16.5g batch would could fetch £640.</p>
      <p>That brought the total value of Grady's haul to £920.</p>
      <p>Grady was taken to the police station to be interviewed, after being detained by officers, and told them the cocaine he had in his trouser pocket was for his own personal use.</p>
      <p>Defence solicitor Marisa Borland explained: "He is 22-years-old and lives with his gran.</p>
      <p>"He helps her with day-to-day tasks but there are other people available [to help her should he be remanded in custody to await sentencing].</p>
      <p>"He is a trainee Quantity Surveyor and attends Glasgow Caledonian University part-time, on a Friday, to get his qualification for that.</p>
      <p>"He has completed one full year and has four years left on that, on a part-time basis - that is funded by his employer. He has responsibility for the coaching of a youth football team and plays football at weekends."</p>
      <p>Sheriff David Pender said: "I'm told you have no previous convictions, and of course I accept that, but this is a serious matter."</p>
      <p>He then called for background reports to be prepared ahead of sentencing, adjourned the case until next month for that to be done, and released Grady on bail.</p>
      <p>Grady could be caged for as long as five years when he returns to the dock to learn his fate.</p>
