      <h1>Harlem Globetrotters' trivia knowledge gets put to the test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:40:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:40</time> by <a rel="author">Yael Halon</a></address>
      <p>Torch George and Big Easy Lofton of the Harlem Globetrotters joined the latest episode of <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=fnc_dailyarticle">Fox Nation's "Quiz Show" </a>where host Tom Shillue put their knowledge to the test.</p>
      <p>Showcasing their iconic tricks, the athletes attempted to teach Shillue to "palm the ball," but the host had a hard time.</p>
      <p>"Good try, don't worry about it," Big Easy joked to a struggling Shillue.</p>
      <p>The comedian and <a href="http://nation.foxnews.com/?cmpid=org=NAT::ag=owned::mc=referral::src=FNC_web::cmp=article::add=fnc_dailyarticle">Fox Nation</a> host had a slew of questions prepared, hoping to stump the athletes with "a trivia test about lunch and things that are purple."</p>

      <p>The duo performed surprisingly well considering the off-the-wall nature of the questions, which included movie and film references.</p>
      <p>When asked what they thought to be the most popular U.S. office lunch, the athletes guessed "soup and sandwich," but were incorrect -- according to Shillue.</p>
      <p>"The answer is Pizza," Shillue corrected.</p>
      <p>Other questions included Mickey Mouse, Prince, and many more pop culture references.</p>
