      <h2>The Sandhill venue wants to stay open later on Thursday and Sunday nights, but neighbours have complained that noise from the club 'reverberates underneath the Tyne Bridge'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Daniel Holland</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/quayside-newcastle">Quayside</a> nightclub has been accused of ignoring neighbours’ complaints of “beyond unacceptable” noise as it battles to extend its opening hours.</p>
      <p>Aveika and the attached Vermont Aparthotel launched a bid to push their closing time back to 3.30am on Thursday and Sunday nights.</p>
      <p>The move has angered neighbours around the Sandhill site, who say that music from the venue “reverberates underneath the Tyne Bridge” in the early hours during the club’s late opening times.</p>
      <p>Ahead of a council hearing next week to decide on the plans, a city centre councillor has also claimed that Aveika “refused to acknowledge that there had ever been any noise problems”.</p>

      <p>However, the venue has secured the support of Northumbria Police and council environmental health chiefs by agreeing to a 2.30am closing time instead.</p>
      <p>But one objecting resident told Newcastle City Council: "We understand we live in the city centre and there will be noise, especially on weekends. We are very understanding to this, however the level of noise that Aveika hosts is beyond unacceptable for the application they are submitting for later licensing and extended days.</p>
      <p>“The bass of the PA systems they use reverberates underneath the Tyne Bridge to anyone who is a resident there and in surrounding streets.”</p>
      <p>Another neighbour added: "This application shows no consideration for neighbouring residents, who have every right to live without disturbance every night of the week including weekends."</p>
      <p>Monument ward councillor Jane Byrne said that, during a meeting with hotel and bar owners the Gainford Group, the applicant refused to acknowledge the complaints.</p>
      <p>She said: "If the applicant can't or won't recognise that things can and have gone wrong, I have no confidence that they would manage the proposed music or later opening hours in a way that will prevent a negative impact on residents."</p>
      <p>Jonathan Bryce, of the council’s licensing authority, says that a further move by Aveika to try and remove a condition on its licence preventing amplified music being played in its outdoor areas shows "little regard" for neighbours.</p>
      <p>But city centre police and environmental health officers have both withdrawn objections to the plan.</p>
      <p>According to documents released ahead of a council licensing sub-committee meeting next Tuesday, that comes after the Gainford Group agreed to a 2.30am closing time and to ensure any outdoor noise will be "background in style and enable customers to talk in comfort".</p>
      <p>Aveika was contacted for a comment.</p>
