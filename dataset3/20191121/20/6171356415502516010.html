      <h1>Slash $50 off a brand new Samsung Galaxy Active2 smartwatch on Amazon and Best Buy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:12:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:12</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/zach-laidlaw/" target="_blank">Zach Laidlaw</a></address>
      <p>Despite <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/11/02/pixel-watch-or-not-fitbit-cant-save-googles-failing-wear-os/">Google's efforts to turn Wear OS into a viable wearable platform</a>, Samsung arguably offers <i>the</i> best smartwatch operating system and hardware available for Android users today. If you've been holding out on getting a watch of your own, or you've been waiting for the perfect time to upgrade, now's your chance to pounce. Select versions of Samsung's Galaxy Active2 smartwatch are available for $50 off right now on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07VQJ56T3/?tag=androidpolice-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-watch-active2-smartwatch-44mm-aluminum-aqua-black/6360438.p?skuId=6360438&amp;intl=nosplash">Best Buy</a>.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/10/09/galaxy-watch-active2-review-dancing-on-the-grave-of-wear-os/">we reviewed the Galaxy Active2 in early October</a>, we couldn't get enough of how buttery smooth the software experience felt. Powered by Tizen OS, Samsung's proprietary operating system outmaneuvers Wear OS in nearly every way, from speed, to a unique touch bezel, and even multi-day battery life. The watch materials feel premium, too. Our biggest gripe was actually the hefty price tag, which this deal greatly alleviates by bringing it closer to the $200 pricing of the original Galaxy Active.</p>
