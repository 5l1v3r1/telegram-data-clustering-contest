      <p>The Texans and Colts are tied for the AFC South lead at 6-4 and on Thursday afternoon both teams were projected by NFL.com to make the playoffs.</p>
      <p>That will change after their “Thursday Night Football” game in Houston, where the Texans are 3½-point favorites over Indianapolis.</p>
      <p>Houston opened as a 5½-point favorite over the Colts on the lookahead line at the Westgate sportsbook before its 41-7 blowout loss at Baltimore. The Westgate reported a sharp play on the Texans at minus 3½ and the betting public is all over Houston at Caesars Entertainment, according to director of trading Jeff Davis.</p>
      <p>“We need the Colts pretty big,” Davis said.</p>
      <p>Indianapolis (5-4-1 ATS) is coming off a 33-13 win over the Jaguars and has won and covered the last three meetings with the Texans (5-5 ATS), including a 30-23 win in Week 7.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big game for both teams but a bigger game for the Texans because they lost to the Colts and now you have the Raiders (6-4) in the equation as a wild-card team,” Sunset Station sportsbook director Chuck Esposito said. “If the Texans lose here, they’re essentially two games behind the Colts because of the tiebreaker.</p>
      <p>“The big thing in this game is (wideout) T.Y. Hilton looks to be back and the Colts are a much better team with him in the lineup. When he’s not in the lineup, they’re 1-6.”</p>
      <p>The consensus total is 46 and Esposito expects Station Casinos’ books to need the under.</p>
      <p>The Texans are on a 3-0 under streak. The Colts have alternated over and under the last seven weeks, going over in their win over Jacksonville.</p>
