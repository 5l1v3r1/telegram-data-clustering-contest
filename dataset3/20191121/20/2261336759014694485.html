      <p>We don’t have a UFC event this weekend, but the big card on Saturday night features a rematch of one of the most entertaining boxing matchups of 2018.</p>
      <p>WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder (41-0-1, 40 KOs) is set to defend his title against Cuba’s Luis Ortiz (31-1-2 NCs, 26 KOs), the only man who has put Wilder in serious danger of a knockout loss. “The Bronze Bomber” had dropped Ortiz in the fifth round of their first encounter, but Ortiz had Wilder badly hurt in round seven, and Wilder did everything he could not to hit the canvas. Three rounds later, Wilder stormed back and knocked out Ortiz to remain unbeaten.</p>
      <p>This time around, the stakes are arguably higher for Wilder. A win over Ortiz clears the path for him to rematch Tyson Fury in 2020. The contracts are signed and all that’s left to agree on is the date, with February 22nd penciled in at the moment.</p>
      <p>You can watch PBC’s Countdown to Wilder vs. Ortiz 2 at the top of the page.</p>
      <p>Wilder vs. Ortiz 2 takes place on Saturday, November 23rd at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The event is available on FOX pay-per-view at a price of $74.99 HD/$64.99 SD, with a start time of 9 PM ET/6 PM PT.</p>
      <p>Bloody Elbow will have full fight week coverage of Wilder vs. Ortiz, including play-by-play, analysis, highlights, and much more.</p>
