      <p>Top White House officials and Senate Republicans have reportedly reached an agreement to hold a full trial if the House votes to impeach President Trump.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/21/white-house-backs-full-senate-trial-if-house-impeaches-trump-072578">Politico report</a> Thursday, multiple people familiar with the matter said that White House officials and Republican senators agreed to not dismiss articles of impeachment outright.</p>
      <p>Despite how some on the right <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/conservatives-push-mcconnell-away-from-impeachment-trial-toward-quick-dismissal">attempted to push</a> Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) to ditch the notion of a fair trial earlier this month, two attendees told Politico that the White House wants the Senate to hold a trial and to not cut it short.</p>
      <p>Politico also reported that several Republican senators met with White House counsel Pat Cipollone, counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner on Thursday morning to discuss impeachment strategy.</p>
      <p>One attendee added that the White House and Trump’s GOP allies “want some kind of factual affirmative defense on the merits,” according to Politico.</p>
      <p>Earlier Thursday, McConnell said that “we’ll be ready” for an impeachment trial “if it comes over here” after “the action is all over in the House,” according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-21-19/h_42bfae38d6d388d7aa34a881225bb319">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>On Monday, McConnell doubled down on his stance that he <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/mcconnell-denies-trump-removal-impeachment-inquiry">“can’t imagine a scenario”</a> where the Senate would vote to remove Trump from office.</p>
