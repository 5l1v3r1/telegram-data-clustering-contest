      <p>The actor is probably best-known for his time starring in EastEnders – but who did he play?</p>
      <h3>Who did Cliff Parisi play in EastEnders?</h3>
      <p>Cliff Parisi played trouble-making Ricky ‘Minty’ Peterson the mechanic in EastEnders for eight years from 2002 to 2010.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>A pal of Phil Mitchell’s who wasn’t shy of a fight, Minty both threw and received his fair share of punches in and around the Queen Vic during his time in Walford.</p>

      <p>Unlucky in love, Minty had a brief relationship with an Australian stripper called SJ until he discovered she was was using him for money, before becoming involved with Hazel Hobbs (his best friend’s mum). The pair got engaged but she called it off when she hit the menopause because she knew Minty wanted a child. Minty eventually made it up the aisle with Heather Trott but, alas, she ended up leaving him for Sam Mitchell.</p>

      <p>Minty eventually left The Square in 2010 to go and live with fellow mechanic Garry Hobbs, with whom he had a long-term and supportive friendship.</p>
      <p>When it was announced that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2010/04/19/eastenders-stars-minty-charlie-slater-and-libby-fox-to-be-axed-248073/">Cliff, along with five other actors, were getting the chop</a> from the soap’s cast back in 2010, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2010/04/27/phil-daniels-slams-enders-exits-267344/">former EastEnders star Phil Daniels spoke out against the decision</a> saying that Cliff’s character Minty was ‘good’ and it was ‘sad’ to see him go.</p>
      <p>‘It’s sad to see characters leave the Square but obviously when a new executive producer like Bryan Kirkwood comes on board they’re always keen to refresh the show and make some changes,’ a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-2/">BBC</a> spokeswoman said at the time.</p>
      <p>‘It’s the way soaps work, characters run their course and new characters come along.’</p>
