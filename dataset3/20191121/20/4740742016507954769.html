      <h1>Loose Women's Carol McGiffin is taken ill and replaced by Rochelle Humes</h1>
      <h2>Loose Women panellist Carol McGiffin started being sick just before going on air</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:03:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Duke, Emma Grimshaw</a></address>
      <p>Only three people sat on Loose Women's panel for the first time in the show's 20-year history - sparking surprise and concern.</p>
      <p>That was until, Rochelle Humes raced it over from hosting the fashion segment on ITV's This Morning to fill the empty seat.</p>
      <p>It was revealed that regular panellist Carol McGiffin had been taken ill with "a sickness bug" right before the popular daytime programme went live on air, reports <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/loose-women-carol-ill-rochelle-17293916">Chronicle Live.</a></p>
      <p>Loose Women tweeted: "We love having <a href="https://twitter.com/RochelleHumes">@RochelleHumes</a> step in as a guest panellist direct from the <a href="https://twitter.com/thismorning">@thismorning</a> studio."</p>

      <p>But fans of the show were quick to ask how Carol was doing. Another joked: "Carol is sick of hearing about Prince Andrew and legged it?"</p>
      <p>However, Rochelle's surprise appearance could not have come at a worse time because <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/x-factor-tv-start-date-269629?service=responsive">X Factor</a> Celebrity act Try Star were special guests.</p>
      <p>One of the group's singer Ben Foden used to be married to Rochelle's Saturdays bandmate Una Healy, before they split after Ben was accused of cheating.</p>
      <p>Loose Women fans had a field day about the potential tension between the two. One quipped "See they’ve put Ben Foden furthest away from Rochelle," and another reacted "Bit awks for Ben and Rochelle to be guests on the same day."</p>
      <p>Another praised Rochelle's professionalism, writing "Tad awkward for  <a href="https://twitter.com/RochelleHumes">@RochelleHumes</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/loosewomen">@loosewomen</a> maybe?? Her friend and bandmates ex husband as a guest. Incredibly professional from her, not sure I could do it."</p>
