      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marco-silva/"><b>Marco Silva</b></a>'s Toffees are currently <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">15th in the table</a>, five places and seven points ahead of their East Anglian opponents.</p>

      <p>Although Silva remains under pressure, his Everton side have won two of their last four in the league and they are unbeaten in three games across all competitions.</p>
      <p>Key to extending that run to four games will be the battle between Norwich right-back <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-aarons/"><b>Max Aarons</b></a> and Brazilian winger <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/richarlison/"><b>Richarlison</b></a>, who scored <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/southampton-vs-everton_game_92622.html">last time out</a> against Southampton.</p>
      <p>The former Watford player's pace and finishing will be crucial, as will his ability to get in behind and link play with the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gylfi-sigurdsson/"><b>Gylfi Sigurdsson</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dominic-calvert-lewin/"><b>Dominic Calvert-Lewin</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Historically, this fixture has been a good one for the Toffees, who have tasted defeat just once in their last 12 meetings with the Canaries.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-farke/"><b>Daniel Farke</b></a> is another manager under pressure as Norwich's positive start has given way to a dismal run of form that has seen them lose four of their last five league games.</p>
      <p>Norwich, who have drawn a blank in their four away matches and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/norwich-city-vs-man-city_game_92550.html">last won in mid-September</a>, have continually been undone by their leaky defence, which has conceded at least twice in 10 Premier League games this season.</p>
      <p>The Canaries do have talent in the attacking areas but they have continually been overrun in midfield, leading to them getting trapped in their own half for long periods.</p>
      <p>Key to Farke's men getting something from Saturday's match will be Finnish striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/teemu-pukki/"><b>Teemu Pukki</b></a>. The former Celtic man, who netted three times for his country during the recent international break, has not scored in the league since netting six in his first five matches.</p>
      <p>His movement and footballing intelligence will always get him opportunities and Norwich will be hoping that his goalscoring exploits in the last week will have boosted his confidence.</p>

      <p>Everton remain without long-term absentees <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cuco-martina/"><b>Cuco Martina</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andre-gomes/"><b>Andre Gomes</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jean-philippe-gbamin/"><b>Jean-Philippe Gbamin</b></a>, while <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cenk-tosun/"><b>Cenk Tosun</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fabian-delph/"><b>Fabian Delph</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bernard/"><b>Bernard</b></a> are doubts for Saturday's match.</p>
      <p>In their absence, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-davies/"><b>Tom Davies</b></a> is likely to continue alongside <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/morgan-schneiderlin/"><b>Morgan Schneiderlin</b></a> at the base of the Toffees' midfield, while Calvert-Lewin is expected to start up front.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/theo-walcott/"><b>Theo Walcott</b></a> started against Southampton but Silva may opt for former Arsenal winger <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/alex-iwobi/"><b>Alex Iwobi</b></a> instead on the right-hand side.</p>
      <p>Norwich's lengthy injury list has reduced somewhat but they are still unable to call on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/timm-klose/"><b>Timm Klose</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/grant-hanley/"><b>Grant Hanley</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christoph-zimmermann/"><b>Christoph Zimmermann</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/josip-drmic/"><b>Josip Drmic</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamal-lewis/"><b>Jamal Lewis</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Without Lewis, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sam-byram/"><b>Sam Byram</b></a> is the obvious choice to start at left-back, while Farke will have to decide whether to recall young winger <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/todd-cantwell/"><b>Todd Cantwell</b></a> to the starting lineup.</p>
      <p><b>Everton possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Pickford; Sidibe, Mina, Keane, Digne; Davies, Schneiderlin; Iwobi, Sigurdsson, Richarlison; Calvert-Lewin</p>
      <p><b>Norwich City possible starting lineup:</b><br/>Krul; Aarons, Amadou, Godfrey, Byram; Vrancic, McLean; Cantwell, Stiepermann, Buendia; Pukki</p>

      <h3>We say: Everton 3-1 Norwich City</h3>
      <p>Norwich's recent form hardly makes for pleasant reading and while there's a good chance that Teemu Pukki gets back among the goals, Everton should have more than enough quality to make it four unbeaten in all competitions.</p>
