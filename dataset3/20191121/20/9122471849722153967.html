      <h1>Bill O’Brien Announces Will Fuller’s Status vs. Colts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:55:32+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>First place in the AFC South is on the line tonight when the Houston Texans battle the Indianapolis Colts. Not only is T.Y. Hilton scheduled to return for <i>Thursday Night Football</i>, fourth-year wideout Will Fuller is also expected to play.</p>
      <p>Houston could use Fuller to open up its offense against Indianapolis. He’s been out of the lineup since October due to a hamstring injury.</p>
      <p>The Texans listed Fuller as questionable for this game, but head coach Bill O’Brien provided an update on his talented wide receiver.</p>
      <p>O’Brien told ESPN reporter Ed Werder that Fuller is going to play against the Colts.</p>

      <p>Fuller has 34 receptions for 450 yards and three touchdowns this season. Most of his production came on Oct. 6 when he torched the Atlanta Falcons for 217 receiving yards and three scores.</p>
      <p>Deshaun Watson often targets Fuller down the field. Now that he’s back in the lineup, the Texans might want to test the Colts’ secondary early in the game.</p>
      <p>For the first time in over a month, the Texans will have three talented wideouts at their disposal. DeAndre Hopkins and Kenny Stills might have an easier time getting open since Fuller is back in the mix.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 8:20 p.m. ET from NRG Stadium.</p>
