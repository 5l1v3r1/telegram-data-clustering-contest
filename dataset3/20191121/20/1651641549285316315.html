      <h1>Bing wants to help US voters make smarter electoral decisions in 2020’s presidential election</h1>

      <p>Microsoft is helping US users gain easier access to candidate information as the 2020 Elections approach in order to help them make smarter decisions when choosing a candidate to vote for.</p>
      <p>“The candidate experience leverages data sources from news articles, official candidate sites and non-partisan partners such as VoteSmart.org. When searching for a particular presidential candidate, we present all of that information into a simple experience where people can find the latest news, upcoming events, and explore each candidate’s stance on the issues, in their own words, from various sources. The experience also provides a summary of each candidate’s voting record on congressional bills,” The Bing Search Team explained on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Note: we said smarter, not better. To head off a predictably lazy and easily countered accusation, Microsoft notes that it is working with a non-partisan organisation<a href="https://justfacts.votesmart.org/"> VoteSmart</a>. Their mission? “To provide free, factual, unbiased information on candidates and elected officials.”</p>
      <p>Microsoft, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-collaborate-with-facebook-twitter-and-google-to-protect-us-elections/">Google</a> and <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/twitter-decides-to-ban-all-political-ads-without-exception/">social media networks</a> are embracing their roles as political tools in the late 2010s. While it’s easier for the firm to close their eyes and pretend people aren’t searching them for political news, moves like this are more reflective of reality. And while these moves do open them up to criticism and accusations of bias, they are at least more honest.</p>
