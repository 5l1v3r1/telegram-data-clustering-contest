        <b>Apple has quietly removed the customer reviews and ratings sections from product pages on the Apple Store.</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you visit the Apple Store seeking to buy a <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/iphone-11">new iPhone</a> or laptop, for example, you won’t be able to see what other buyers thought of their purchase.</p>
      <p>Apple Insider was first to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/21/apple-pulls-all-customer-reviews-from-online-apple-store">report</a> the change, believing it took place over the weekend. Where there was once an opportunity to give the product a star-rating and write a review, there is now no such option.</p>
      <p>You can see an example of that <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU8H2LL/A/smart-keyboard-folio-for-129-inch-ipad-pro-3rd-generation-us-english">within this listing</a> for the iPad Pro Smart Keyboard, but it also applies to all third-party products listed on the store also. There is a question and answer section, but if you’re looking for how other customers rated their Apple purchase, you’ll need to go to a third-party retailer.</p>

      <p>Why Apple has made this choice is unclear. It’s most uncommon for there not to be a customer review section on most major manufacturers’ websites.</p>
      <p>Apple Insider draws attention to a popular YouTube video (57,000+ views) published on November 16, which reads out negative reviews of the new 16-inch Apple MacBook Pro. Strangely enough, it coincides with the removal of the reviews and ratings section from products on the Apple store.</p>

      <p>Apple may feel the reviews are often unjustly negative, with many of its official accessories slated by reviewers simply because they’re more expensive than third-party counterparts.</p>
      <p>However, shutting down the voices of customers is a controversial move that’s sure to be greeted unfavourably. We have reached out to Apple for comment on the matter and will update this article should a response be forthcoming.</p>
