          </p>
          <p>Playing their first match of the Super League stage yesterday, for Rajasthan at the end of the day, the runs they ended up leaking were too much to get around. Paired with that, the side kept losing wickets at regular intervals, a predicament which saw them fall to a 15 run defeat despite a late surge bat their middle-order.</p>
          <p>Needing 202 as they took on Baroda in what was an edge of the seat thriller, for all the clean hitting sorties in the death overs, the side ended up suffering the aberrations of a shambolic top-order collapse. It not only saw them totter towards the target but see the net run-rate climb to a colossal 11 per over in the culminating overs to see the side fold out their effort at 186.</p>

                <p>And when they face off against Haryana come their second match within the space of day, the side know they can’t afford to repeat the mistakes of yesterday. Playing their first match of this stage, Haryana will be looking to come hot out of the blocks against a hurting Rajasthan unit, one which is there for the taking as things stand.</p>
                <p>Haryana themselves are an extremely formidable unit with their second place in Group D being a testament to the pristine brand of cricket the same have engaged their ardent supporters in. The side come into today’s encounter carrying with them one of the longest winning sprees with the side having registered clinical wins in all their previous five outings, a form they’ll be looking to reverberate come today as well.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>A tricky wicket to bat on, this surface will relatively play out in favour of the bats in the second part of the encounter with the pitch settling in the under sun. The side winning the toss is bound to come out and field first today and allow their spinners to restrict the opposition to a low score and give their batters ample time to chase down the target.</p>

                            <h3>RJS Vs HAR Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Rajasthan’s Manender Singh comes into our side as the first player with the wicket-keeper having played out some solid and table innings to not only hold fort for the side but storm into the opposition’s castle as well and destroy their bowling unit.</p>
                            <h3>RJS Vs HAR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>We continue to pick up the bats from Rajasthan in this docket of our Dream 11 side with Arjit Gupta and Ankit Lumba both being selected by us. The duo was responsible for the resolute and engrossing onslaught the side doled out in the death overs to try and move as close as plausible to the target at hand to make them instant picks for the day.</p>
                            <p>From the other side we will be making an advent with the lone selection of Pramod Chandila.</p>
                            <h3>RJS Vs HAR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Time for us to compensate for the batting picks from Haryana in this facet of our Dream 11 unit with us roping in Harshal Patel as the first name here. The all-rounder has regaled us in riveting and resounding displays with the player amassing the 267 runs and snaring 17 wickets at the same time to become the focal point of his side’s marauding wins.</p>
                            <p>Rahul Tewatia has scored 92 runs and taken the 2 wickets till now and with this being a track where the spinners are bound to flourish, we becomes our choice in this component of our side from Haryana as well. From Rajasthan elsewhere, we are venturing in with the series of their captain Mahipal Lomor who has garnered 130 runs till now.</p>
                            <h3>RJS Vs HAR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>Yuzvendra Chahal missed out on the tournamnet till now after having been involved in India’s squad for the foregone T20series against Bangladesh. He’s back now tough and will be making an instant entry into not only our side but his team’s unit as well with the legspinner being a pivotal part of their component of this track.</p>
                            <p>Amit Mishra comes in as well with the two wrist spinners forming a daunting and indomitable partnership, two players who’ll function in tandem and manifest their repertoire of spinning capabilities to fruition. </p>
                            <p>The 8 wickets see Ashish Hooda come in as well while from the other side we are choosing Khaleel Ahmed who has taken the 7 wickets till now.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Harshal Patel will lead our side out for the day whilst Chahal is the vice-captain.</p>
