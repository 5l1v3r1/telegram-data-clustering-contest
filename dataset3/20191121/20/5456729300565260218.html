      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed November 30 for the conduct of supplementary and re-run elections for Kogi West Senatorial District and Ajaokuta Federal Constituency respectively.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the INEC National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, said the decision was taken at the meeting held on Thursday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>He recalled that at the conclusion of the court-ordered Kogi West Senatorial re-run election on Saturday, supplementary polls were indicated by the Collation/Retuming Officer for the Senatorial District.</p>
      <p>The affected areas include 20 Registration Areas, 53 Polling Units and 46,767 Registered Voters spread across seven Local Government Areas of the Senatorial District.</p>
      <p>“In addition, the court ordered the conduct of Supplementary re-run poll in Ajaokuta Federal Constituency affecting 22 Polling Units.”</p>
      <p>Mr Okoye said collation procedures shall be in line with extant Guidelines for Collation at the Supplementary polls.</p>
      <p>He added that the list of affected registration areas and polling units would be uploaded on INEC website and communicated to the stakeholders in the respective registration areas and polling units.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“We enjoin all the political parties and stakeholders to cooperate with the commission for conclusive free and credible elections in the affected areas,” Mr Okoye said.</p>
      <p>INEC declared the Saturday’s senatorial re-run election for Kogi West inconclusive because the margin of win was less than the total cancelled votes.</p>
      <p>INEC Returning Officer for the election, Olayide Lawal, said the candidate of the APC, Smart Adeyemi polled 80,118 votes while Dino Melaye of the PDP got 59,548.</p>
      <p>Mr Lawal, however, said votes were cancelled across 53 polling units in the senatorial district with 46,127 registered voters due to violence and snatching of ballot boxes.</p>
