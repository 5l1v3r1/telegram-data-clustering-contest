      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lisa Hutchinson</a></address>
      <p>These are the region’s most inspirational children who could show us adults a thing or two.</p>
      <p>They have battled illness to be here today and their bravery was recognised at a special ceremony at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James’ Park </a>in Newcastle.</p>
      <p>A total of 22 children were awarded Brave Hearts and lit up the room with their smiles.</p>
      <p>And on Thursday the youngsters from across the North East and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/cumbria">Cumbria</a> each received a Brave Hearts crystal plinth and a gift of their choice, in recognition of their strength and courage they have shown in battling illness or adversity.</p>
      <p>Each young Brave Heart has a humbling and inspiring story to tell. And they have all faced their own personal battle and have found their unique way of coping.</p>
      <p>Their efforts, and the spirit with which they deal with their illnesses, is a massive inspiration to those around them.</p>
      <p>And they were presented their awards by ex-Newcastle footballer and now <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead-fc">Gateshead FC</a> manager Mike Williamson.</p>

      <p>Eight-year-old Ryan Waites, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/dipton">Dipton</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">County Durham,</a> was excited to pick up his award.</p>
      <p>Brave Hearts trustee John Dunn who hosted th awards, said: “Ryan has Pulmonary Artesia VSD and bronchial difficulties. He has undergone 7 open heart surgeries, which following complications after last years procedure lead to a whole year in hospital recovering from it. He has been so brave through all of his surgeries and he acts like nothing has happened, being an inspiration to his mum and all those he is in contact with. He is a truly amazing little boy and clearly a true Brave Heart.”</p>
      <p>His mum Lisa Waites, 39, said:”He’s been through a mammoth amount of illness in his young life. In his eight years he’s had loads of procedures.</p>
      <p>“He was born with a complex congenital heart defect. At five weeks old he had his first surgery, he lost his dad Andrew, when he was just three-years-old due to a heart attack, and now Ryan is my world.”</p>

      <p>Eryn Lilly Howie, eight, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fenham">Fenham</a>, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a>, is only eight but has gone through 24 surgical procedures and has had a kidney transplant.</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn said: “Eryn suffered kidney failure, has had a kidney transplant, has hip dysplasia and has already endured 24 surgical procedures in her life. Despite this she is a very happy, inspirational and determined young girl that loves life to the full. She is very caring, and has done the Mini North Run and Seven Bridges Kidney Walk numerous times to raise funds for kidney research. She has also attended the British Transplant games several times. Eryn does dance classes and recently has been part of a large dance show and took part in eight separate routines on stage in a local theatre. Being courageous isn’t an option for Eryn, it’s a way of daily life she faces head on, .... And so we are very pleased to give her this Brave Hearts Award today.”</p>
      <p>Eryn said: “I think I’m very brave. I’ve had 24 operations and I’m only eight”</p>
      <p>Brave five-year-old Penny Turner, from <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newbiggin-by-the-sea">Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, </a>was just nine hours old when she had her first operation and she’s had 13 more since then.</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn said: “Penny was born with spina bifida and had her very first surgery at just 9 hours old, and has since had a further 13 operations. The ongoing medical interventions left Penny often very frightened of hospital and medical staff, but with a little persuasion she allows the staff to do what is necessary. Penny is a determined young lady and will give anything a go, to the best of her abilities, including participating in channel 4’s ‘Secret Life of Four Year Olds’, last year, and winning the junior Great North Run wheelchair race for the last two years. Her attitude to life leaves us in awe and she is a great candidate for a Brave Hearts Award.”</p>
      <p>Penny’s mum Heather, 39, said: “This is an amazing event and a huge achievement of strength and courage by these children who go through so much on a day to day basis to stay alive.</p>
      <p>“It’s such an honour to see Penny here with these other children. They are all so deserving of a Brave Heart award.”</p>

      <p>Ellie Percival, 16, of Redcar, has had a tough two years but is still facing life with a smile.</p>
      <p>Mr Dunn said: “Ellie has been treated for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia. Despite everything that Ellie has been through for the last two years she is always happy and friendly. She has tried her best to carry on with life and attends school and now college whenever she is able. She has demonstrated tremendous strength of character and courage to keep going even when she sometimes feels so poorly. She is an inspirational young lady and very deserving of a Brave Hearts Award.”</p>
      <p>Ellie said: “I am very proud and excitedly to be here today. I’ve been through a lot and this is a big achievement for me.  I’m getting there.”</p>
