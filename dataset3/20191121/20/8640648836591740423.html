      <p>An 18-year-old robbery suspect shot by Henderson police Wednesday night has died, police confirmed Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>A news release from the Henderson Police Department said <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/henderson-police-shoot-man-suspected-of-shooting-another-at-restaurant-1897367/">officers responded at 7:13 p.m. to a restaurant in the 1200 block of West Warm Springs Road</a> “in reference to a panic alarm coming from the freezer of a fast food establishment.” Police found a 35-year-old male employee in the freezer with a gunshot wound to the chest. The man was transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in critical condition, but he has since been upgraded to stable.</p>
      <p>“Witnesses on scene directed officers to the area the suspect had last been seen,” police said in the release. “The male suspect was located on foot on a nearby median armed with two handguns. Officers contacted the male, who immediately began firing shots at officers, resulting in the use of deadly force.”</p>
      <p>No officers were injured. The suspect’s name has not been released.</p>
      <p>Police said the deceased is believed to be “a primary suspect in several armed commercial robberies that recently occurred within the city of Henderson,” police said.</p>
      <p>Police said at the scene Wednesday night that preliminary information indicated an attempted robbery was unfolding when the restaurant employee was shot.</p>
      <p>The officer-involved shooting is the fifth in Henderson in 2019.</p>
