      <p><i>Rocket League</i> has a fantastically simple premise: soccer, but with cars. With an idea that strong and the game’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/17/17578850/rocket-league-review-xbox-one-switch-ps4-pc">easy-to-learn-impossible-to-master mechanics,</a> <i>Rocket League</i> was in a good position to succeed. But developer Psyonix made <i>Rocket League</i> one of the most popular games of the decade by introducing innovations and strategies that would pave the way for the rest of the industry.</p>
      <h3>Pre-Game</h3>
      <p>Psyonix announced <i>Rocket League</i> in 2014 as a sequel to the developer’s 2008 car-soccer game, the unfortunately titled and under-played <i>Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars</i>. The developer quickly realized that people weren’t aware of its previous car-soccer game and its follow-up was in trouble.</p>
      <p>As a smaller studio that didn’t have enough money for traditional marketing, the team started making YouTube videos and <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2015/08/10/top-games-for-july-2015-rocket-league-edition-f278d248475a/">Twitch streams</a>. These streams provided fans and curious players with frequent looks at the game and insight into how <i>Rocket League</i> was coming along — something that’s become common among developers of all sizes since.</p>
      <h3>The Kick Off</h3>
      <p>When it was finally released in July 2015 for PlayStation 4 and Windows PC, it was an instant hit. While the game’s release timing certainly had a hand in its success — the summer is typically a slow time of the year for games — there was another larger factor at play: PlayStation Plus.</p>
      <p>Psyonix made a deal with Sony. Rather than sell the game traditionally to PlayStation players, <i>Rocket League</i> would be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/1/8877523/playstation-plus-free-games-july-2015">free for anyone that had PlayStation Plus</a>, Sony’s online subscription. Releasing the game for “free” seemed surprising at the time, but it turns out Psyonix made the perfect choice.</p>

      <p>Sony helped promote the game and in the first few days, <i>Rocket League </i>had over 100,000 players. This user spike resulted in a litany of server issues that <a href="https://kotaku.com/rocket-league-is-so-good-nobody-cares-that-the-servers-1718542543">fans were surprisingly happy to put up with</a>. The game stayed free on PlayStation Plus for just under a month. Design director Corey Davis, at a <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/268923/Smart_calls_timing_luck_amp__poverty_How_Rocket_League_succeeded.php">GDC talk in 2016</a>, said the decision led to six million downloads and called it the “best decision we ever made.”</p>
      <p>Now launching games as part of subscription services seems like an obvious choice. Many Xbox games, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-one/2019/9/28/20889044/gears-5-xbox-game-pass-multiplayer-boot-camp-xbox-one-pc">especially first-party games</a>, are available through Xbox Game Pass the same day as they are released.</p>
      <h3>Playing together</h3>
      <p>One of the earliest of <i>Rocket League</i>’s standout features was that players on different platforms could play together thanks to cross-platform compatibility. Cross-play may feel like a standard feature for an online game these days, but when <i>Rocket League</i> added it, the feature was nearly absent from consoles. At launch, PlayStation 4 and Windows players could play the game together. Later, the Xbox One version got cross-platform play with Windows <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/14/11219726/xbox-one-rocket-league-cross-platform-play-announced">in 2016 </a>and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/15/16655804/rocket-league-switch-cross-platform-play">Nintendo Switch version got the feature</a> when it launched in 2017.</p>
      <p>Sony remained the lone holdout on allowing PS4 players to play with other consoles. According to Psyonix, enabling the feature would have been a simple fix, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2017/6/13/15795376/rocket-league-cross-platform-playstation-4">if Sony would only approve it</a>. Finally, spurred on by the release of the mega-popular <i>Fortnite Battle Royale</i> in 2018, Sony relented and let that game’s players compete across platforms. Sony said that it would approve other games on a case-by-case basis, with <i>Rocket League</i> quickly getting approval just a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/14/18182370/rocket-league-crossplay-ps4-switch-xbox-one-pc">few months</a> after <i>Fortnite</i>.</p>

      <h3>Spectator sport</h3>
      <p>After the game’s release it became evident that people liked watching <i>Rocket League</i> almost as much as they liked playing it. By the first few weeks, players were already <a href="https://kotaku.com/something-magical-happened-in-the-rocket-league-finals-1725571054">organizing and streaming tournaments</a> for fans eager to see the tricks that only the best <i>Rocket League </i>players could pull off.</p>
      <p>The game felt built for the new era of streaming in a way that few other titles would tap into until <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/20/16795524/pubg-review-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-pc-xbox-one"><i>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</i> exploded in 2017</a>. Psyonix was happy to lean into the popularity. The developer immediately started work on a spectator mode that would make tournaments easier to watch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-08-12-rocket-league-gets-spectator-mode-new-arena">released the mode in August 2015</a>, just a month after the game’s release.</p>
      <p>Less than a year later, in early 2016, Psyonix would take <i>Rocket League</i> esports into its own hands with the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS). While previous <i>Rocket League</i> tournaments were held by third-party organizations, the RLCS allowed Psyonix more control and the chance to spotlight new features and DLC for the game. The RLCS also provided professional teams and players a structured environment to play <i>Rocket League</i>, and hosted high-profile tournaments, complete with prize money and impressive venues.</p>
      <p>In the three years since its debut, the RLCS and <i>Rocket League</i> tournaments still hold a loyal fan base on Twitch. Meanwhile the developers behind games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/4/13511762/overwatch-league-is-blizzards-ambitious-new-esports-org-includes-city"><i>Overwatch</i></a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattperez/2019/10/18/new-details-on-activision-blizzards-call-of-duty-league-revealed/#157d86fa3635"><i>Call of Duty</i></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/6/18068550/pubg-competitive-schedule-global-championship"><i>PUBG</i></a>, and even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/2019/8/2/20752247/fortnite-season-x-champion-series-tournaments"><i>Fortnite</i></a><i> </i>have since created their own leagues and moved to a first-party style of esports organization.</p>
      <p><i>Rocket League</i> is a game about cars playing soccer. It’s a fun, approachable, and deeply complex sports game that’s become one of the most impactful titles in the last 10 years. And thanks to some prescient decisions on the part of Psyonix, <i>Rocket League</i> helped lead the industry throughout the latter half of the decade.</p>
