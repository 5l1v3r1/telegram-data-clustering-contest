      <p>Two men from an ATM management and cash pick-up company were allegedly kidnapped and their van was looted of Rs 80 lakh by armed men in Dwarka Thursday, said police.</p>
      <p>According to police, the accused allegedly attacked the driver and the guard inside the van, and made off with the money from the vault. According to police, the van was found near Sector 11 in Dwarka in a damaged condition, with the two men lying unconscious inside.</p>
      <p>While the accused haven’t been identified so far, police said they have accessed CCTV footage from nearby areas. The victims, Dhiraj and Vipin Mishra, were accompanied by two other men working as custodians, who had gone to fill cash inside an ATM at the time of the incident.</p>
      <p>According to police, the incident took place at 12.30 pm in Dwarka’s Sector 6, near Manipal Hospital. The custodians, Narendra and Vikas, told police: “We were coming from Naraina after putting cash in two-three ATMs. We then went to an ATM near Manipal Hospital. Dhiraj parked the van on the road opposite the hospital, and Mishra was with him when we left. When we came back half an hour later, the van was missing. We called them, but they didn’t pick up. So we called police…”</p>
      <p>Police said that soon after receiving the complaint, they received information about two injured men lying inside a van in Sector 11.</p>
      <p>Anto Alphonse, DCP (Dwarka), said, “Initial investigation revealed two men were involved. It seems the accused threatened the driver and the guard with a knife. They took the money from the van, drove it to another spot and beat up the victims. They later fled.”</p>
      <p>Police said the injured men were rushed to Venkateshwar Hospital and are receiving treatment. “We have recorded statements of the custodians,” said DCP Alphonse. Police said the guard, Mishra, was found with his weapon, which he did not use at the time of the incident. “We are probing the case from all angles,” said the DCP.</p>
