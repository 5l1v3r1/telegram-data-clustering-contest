      <h1>Jamie Foxx Replacing Katie Holmes With Kate Beckinsale?</h1>

      <hr/>
      <p><b>Jamie Foxx</b> is not replacing <b>Katie Holmes</b> with <b>Kate Beckinsale</b> as the new woman in his life, despite a bogus tabloid report. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can correct the story. There’s zero truth to it.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Foxx and Beckinsale posed together at a Golden Globes Ambassadors party in Los Angeles. This alone led to rumors the two are dating, but Beckinsale herself swiftly denied there’s any romance between the two. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B45s8oIAwiY/">Beckinsale shared photos from the event on Instagram</a>, and in addition to posing with Foxx, she included pictures of her hanging out with other partygoers. The actress added, “I would like to point out that standing next to someone does not mean I am dating them.”</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that didn’t stop <i><b>In Touch</b></i> from publishing a phony headline reading, “Jamie &amp; Kate: It’s On!” It’s not, but the magazine refers to Foxx and Beckinsale as the “hottest new couple” in Hollywood. “They’re into each other, and they’re not hiding it,” a supposed source tells the tabloid. “The chemistry is off the charts, and they’re seeing where it goes.”</p>
      <p>From there, the outlet arbitrarily drags Holmes into its fictional storyline. The alleged tipster says that like Holmes, Beckinsale is “totally Jamie’s type: brunette and gorgeous.” The seemingly phony source adds, “His friends say he replaced Katie with a more stylish British version of her. This is a budding romance, but they make a great couple.”</p>
      <p>As noted above, Beckinsale already refuted the rumors that she’s dating Foxx, so the tabloid’s entire premise is baseless. In realty, <i>In Touch</i> just jumped on the opportunity to throw Holmes’ name into this fake scenario. Foxx didn’t replace his ex with an actress he’s not dating.</p>
      <p>If it wasn’t already clear that the magazine prints fiction, <b>Gossip Cop</b> would like to point to a cover story it published around a year ago this time. In November 2018, the outlet wrongly reported <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-wedding-twins-not-true/">Foxx and Holmes were planning a wedding and having twins together</a>. That absurd narrative obviously didn’t pan out. Can anyone really take this publication seriously when it comes to the personal life of either star?</p>
      <p>This also wouldn’t be the first time the outlet has created a fake report based on Foxx being photographed with a famous woman at a public event. Back when he was still dating Holmes, the magazine insisted the <i>Dawson’s Creek</i> star was furious about <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jamie-foxx-charlize-theron-flirting-katie-holmes-furious/">Foxx flirting with Charlize Theron at a boxing match</a>. The only truthful aspect of that article was that Foxx and Theron were pictured chatting at the event. Perhaps <i>In Touch</i> should stop framing phony stories around the wrong interpretation of a photo.</p>
