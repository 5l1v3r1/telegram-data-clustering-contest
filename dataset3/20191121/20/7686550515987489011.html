      <p>Former Gladiators star Ace has opened up about going from earning £2,000 an hour to £20 since the show ended.</p>
      <p>Warren Furman enjoyed a life filled with fast cars, first class travel and no shortage of female attention during his time as one of the huge ITV programme’s stars. But suddenly he found himself jobless and searching for work on a building site, worrying about how he was going to make ends meet.</p>
      <p>Gladiators aired between 1992 and 2000, racking up a total of eight series, with Warren joining the show in series five. It made stars of Gladiators like Wolf and Jet, as well as presenter Ulrika Jonsson. This is <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/film-tv/what-original-cast-gladiators-looks-9865335">what the original cast of Gladiators looks like now</a>.</p>
      <p>Furman appeared on This Morning to talk about his ‘crash down into the real world’ as he adjusted to life away from the hit Saturday night gameshow, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/ace-gladiators-i-used-earn-17288016">MEN reports</a>.</p>
      <p>He told hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: "When you've had something like that and it's taken away from you and you're not earning a living out of it anymore, and all people want to know is daft stuff — well, it seemed daft because now I wasn't earning any money."</p>

      <p>He said: "I came crashing down into the real world. I could earn £2,000 an hour on Gladiators, now I'm lucky if I could get £20 an hour. Then people are coming over like 'What's Ulrika like? What's Wolf like?' and in the end I was a bit like 'I'm not actually public property any more, I'm just trying to make a living, so I don't really want to talk about it anymore'.</p>
      <p>"I know that sounds conceited, but I felt like I was living in the past."</p>

      <p>The bodybuilder also spoke of his relationship with Katie Price. The couple dated in the late 1990s during the height of her glamour model days as Jordan.</p>
      <p>He said: “We were very similar people, we both grew up in similar circumstances, working class. We both took our clothes off for a living in a way. I wore the lycra. We had a lot of time together as well.”</p>
      <p>Addressing why they split, he added: “We were both deriving our identities from being relevant in the media. We were both selling stories.”</p>
