      <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu-faces-graft-indictment-ruling-at-1730-gmt-ministry-263731">indicted by the country's justice ministry</a> for bribery, corruption, fraud and breach of trust on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Netanyahu faced a three-year-long probe in three cases. The judgement delivers a tight blow to Netanyahu just before possible polls. </p>
      <p>Netanyahu now faces a trial in court and in case he gets convicted he will be barred from contesting polls and could also face a 10-year-long jail term. </p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit announced the decision, the first of its kind against a serving Israeli prime minister, in a statement and said the charges included bribery, breach of trust and fraud.</p>
      <p>Police recommended in February that Mandelblit file criminal charges against the right-wing prime minister in the long-running investigations dubbed Cases 1000, 2000 and 4000.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases, saying he is a victim of a political witch-hunt.</p>
      <p>He is suspected of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons and of dispensing favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by an Israeli newspaper and a website, news agency Reuters reported. </p>
      <p>He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum 3-year term for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>An indictment against Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader, would raise more uncertainty over <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/israel-president-asks-parliament-to-find-new-pm-and-avoid-elections-263705">who will ultimately lead a country</a> mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections this year.</p>
