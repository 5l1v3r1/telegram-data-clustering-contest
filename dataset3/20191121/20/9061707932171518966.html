      <p>North End will also be boosted by the return from suspension of Ben Pearson, and only one player will definitely miss out.</p>
      <p>Louis Moult is recovering from an ACL injury suffered in August.</p>
      <p>Derby are expecting to benefit from the return of Scott Malone, while Tom Lawrence will recover from illness.</p>
      <p>The Rams will, however, likely be without Tom Huddlestone, who continues to battle hamstring issues.</p>
