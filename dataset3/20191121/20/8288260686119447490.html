      <h1>'Toxic' - This is how Aston Villa fans will welcome back Steve Bruce</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa v Newcastle United | Former claret and blue manager will be bringing his Newcastle United side to his old stomping ground in the Premier League on Monday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:25:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:25</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Some Aston Villa fans have been discussing how they will react when Steve Bruce returns to Villa Park on Monday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> brings his Newcastle United side to B6 in a crucial Premier League clash in front of the television cameras (8pm) hoping to inflict a defeat on the club that sacked him just over a year ago.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-fc">Birmingham City</a> manager was relieved of his duties in October last year after a 3-3 draw to Preston North End at Villa Park.</p>
      <p>He spent two years at the club, leading Villa to the 2018 Championship play-off final where his side suffered a 1-0 loss to Fulham.</p>

      <p>Dean Smith took over Bruce and led <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> to a second successive Wembley trip, beating Derby County in the Championship's showpiece occasion.</p>
      <p>It is widely acknowledged that Bruce steadied an uneasy ship he inherited from the brief reign of Roberto Di Matteo in 2016 and averted what would have been a disastrous relegation in 2016-17.</p>
      <p>And Villa fans have had their say on social media as to how they will greet Bruce.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the reaction...</i>
      </p>
      <p>@ <b>Michael76851525</b> : I will be clapping him. Villa was a toxic place and he got the feel good factor back. There was a disconnect between the fans and players, he brought in big characters like of Terry, Snodgrass, etc who the fans loved. We wouldn't be back in the PL without him imo</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>@ <b>sljvilla</b> : Clap him. He helped save a sinking ship &amp; turn toxic atmosphere to positive. Also worked whilst going through terrible personal times. Didn’t work out for him &amp; we’ve all moved on thankfully</p>
      <p>@ <b>realsammalone</b> : Is it too much to expect us to show a bit of class? Polite applause, move on.....</p>
      <p>@ <b>MarkavParry</b> : Clap him. Some good times were had, felt for him on this day. Losing a parent is heartbreaking</p>
      <p>@ <b>Villachick1972</b> : Who.....my energy will be focused for dean and the lads</p>
      <p>@ <b>SteveFr94038629</b> : Should beg him to come back. Did wonders for us.</p>

      <p>@ <b>B6Nigel</b> : Polite applause; then forget all about  it at the first whistle. It’s points not personalities that are important to us on Monday</p>
      <p>@ <b>avpriceyfc</b> : For all Bruce’s shortcomings (Ex-Blues, Villa’s Play-Off final performance) he did steady the ship, signed McGinn and for that we are grateful. Like Dean, he’s now managing his boyhood club so for that we should wish him well (except for Monday’s game).</p>
