      <p>The bookies have made some bold predictions so far about the new series of I'm A Celebrity and their latest concerns the contestant they think will quit first.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/im-a-celebrity-winner-odds-17279963">the favourite to win this year's show</a> is changing all the time, with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-17271943">Caitlyn Jenner</a> , Jacqueline Jossa and Roman Kemp all hotly tipped, there are also shortening odds on the celeb experts predict will walk out of the jungle before they've had a chance to be voted off.</p>
      <p>And the front runner to quit as things stand is initial favourite to win, football legend Ian Wright. The former Arsenal and England striker was the hot tip to triumph on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> before the show had even started, but his odds to win have jot drifted, while the odds on him walking have shortened significantly.</p>
      <p>Odds were slashed over Ian's F-world laden clash with comedian Andrew Maxwell over a crocodile dinner.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://news.paddypower.com/tag/im-a-celebrity-odds/">Paddy Power</a> spokesperson said "He was our favourite from before series 19 had even aired, but it appears Ian Wright’s mood swing has seriously turned bettors off – so much so that he’s gone from top spot to halfway down the market.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been forced to cut the odds of the former footballer being the first celebrity to exit the jungle this year, too. Maybe that old stereotype that footballers are divas is true, eh?”</p>
      <p>Odds on Ian Wright quitting are now as short as 3/1, with odds on 7/1 on him quitting before the end of next week and 12/1 he'll be gone before this week is through.</p>
