      <p>FAIRBANKS, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska woman charged with the courthouse theft of a gun that was being used as evidence against her has accepted a plea deal on her original charges.</p>
      <p>The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported Thursday that 29-year-old Tiffany Flenaugh was on trial for assault, weapons misconduct and resisting arrest.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say she waved around a .45-caliber handgun in a bar and fought with bouncers and police officers in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Authorities say that during a break in her trial Tuesday she removed the unloaded gun from an evidence box and hid it outside.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Flenaugh as she re-entered the courthouse.</p>
      <p>The trial resumed Wednesday and Flenaugh pleaded guilty to charges related to three separate cases including weapons misconduct.</p>
      <p>Flenaugh was sentenced to 445 days suspended and one year of probation.</p>
