      <p>Meanwhile, a Twitter user recently gave a lot of social media users some food for thought about parenting. The lady who goes under the Twitter handle, @neauxna, <a href="https://legit.ng/1277911-lady-tells-parents-children-dont-belong-them.html">stated that parents need to understand that their kids don't belong to them.</a></p>
      <p>According to her, rather than focus on living through their kids, parents should focus on helping them become the best version of themselves.</p>
