      <p>One of the biggest features of any Pokemon game is the act of evolving your Pokemon to higher evolutions. Oftentimes you’ll need to acquire special Evolution Stones to unlock your Pokemon’s evolutionary power. In this guide we’ll go over all of the Evolution Stones you can find in Pokemon Sword and Shield, and even discuss which Pokemon they need to be given to for evolution purposes.</p>
      <h3>Evolution Stones guide – Pokemon Sword and Shield</h3>
      <p>If you’re planning on evolving all of your Pokemon, then knowing how Evolution Stones work will be vital to your success in Pokemon Sword or Pokemon Shield. Basically, while some Pokemon will evolve naturally, others like Eevee, will need the use of specific Evolution Stones to evolve to specific evolutions.</p>

      <p>To make use of an Evolution Stone, you’re going to need to give them to the Pokemon that require them. This can be done by heading into your Bag by opening the menu with X. Next, select your Bag, then navigate over to the “Other Items” section. Finally, highlight the particular Evolution Stone that you want to use and then use the item on the Pokemon. Do not give it to the Pokemon as this will not do you any good.</p>
      <p>Now that you know how to use Evolution Stones, let’s discuss the various types, as well as what Pokemon they work on.</p>
