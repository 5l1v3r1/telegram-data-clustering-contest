      <h1>Poll Shows More Oppose Impeachment than Support It</h1>
      <h2>More Americans oppose impeachment than support it, a National Emerson College poll released on Thursday <a href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/november-national-poll-support-for-impeachment-declines-biden-and-sanders-lead-democratic-primary">revealed</a>.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:30:16+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Bleau</a></address>
      <p>The poll, which coincided with the seventh public impeachment hearing in the nation’s capital, found that opposition to the partisan impeachment effort is growing, while support is slipping.</p>
      <p>Conducted November 17-20, 2019, among 1,092 registered voters, the poll found that a greater percentage of people now oppose impeachment than support it.</p>
      <p>“Support for impeachment has flipped since October from 48% support with 44% opposing to now 45% opposed and 43% in support,” Emerson found. The greatest shift in opinion occurred among independent voters, who now oppose impeachment 49 percent to 34 percent. Last month, independents supported impeachment 48 percent to 39 percent.</p>
      <p>More via Emerson:</p>
      <blockquote>The impeachment hearings are being watched or followed by 69% of voters. A plurality (26%) is getting their information from Fox News, 24% are getting their information from 1 of the 3 network stations (ABC, NBC, CBS), 16% are watching CNN, 15% MSNBC and 19% are going somewhere else for their information.</blockquote>
      <p>The margin of error is +/- 2.9 percent.</p>
      <p>The results coincide with a <i>Politico-</i>Morning Consult poll <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000016e-80be-da10-ad7e-9bbfca8d0000">released</a> this week, which showed support for impeachment dropping and opposition growing, particularly among independents.</p>
      <p>As Breitbart News <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/19/poll-independents-opposition-to-impeachment-jumps-10-points-in-week/">reported</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The survey was taken November 15-17 among 1,994 registered voters and found that 47 percent of independents actively oppose the impeachment inquiry. This figure is a 10-point increase from last week, as <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/471057-poll-independent-opposition-to-impeachment-inquiry-jumps-10-points-in-last">noted</a> by the<i> Hill</i>. Independent support for the inquiry fell to 40 percent – a seven-point drop. Overall, support for the inquiry dropped by two points and opposition grew by three points.</blockquote>
      <p>Nonetheless, some left-wing politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/20/fact-check-sanders-suggests-impeachment-hearings-are-convincing-americans-trump-is-in-violation-of-the-law/">believe</a> the public impeachment hearings are actively convincing the American people that “we have a president who thinks he’s above the law.”</p>
      <p>“But what I am of the opinion is that the American people now do believe, and the more they see these impeachment hearings on television, they do believe that we have a president who thinks he’s above the law,” Sanders said.</p>
      <p>“We have a president who has engaged in corruption. We have a president who has obstructed justice and, in my view, somebody who’s violated the emoluments clause,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“But my inclination is that the American people do believe that this president is in violation of the law,” he added:</p>
