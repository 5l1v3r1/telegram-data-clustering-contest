      <p>PHOENIX — Phoenix Rising Football Club had a record breaking season and team captain, Solomon Asante led the team, earning himself the USL Championship Most Valuable Player.</p>
      <p>During the 2019 season, Asante was named the regular-season USL Championship Golden Boot Winner with 22 goals and 16 assists, breaking the club and league record for combined goals and assists. He also lead the team in goals, assists, shots, and chances created.</p>

      <p>Alongside this honor, Asante was named to the 2019 USL Championship All-League First Team, and was named the USL Player of the Month for June and August. He was also named to the USL Championship Team of the Week several times during the season.</p>
      <p>Asante and two other teammates, Adam Jahn, and Junior Flemmings set a league record for a trio of teammates to score at least 15 goals in a season.</p>
      <p>Although the team was knocked out of the playoffs early, the team continued to win off the field. Head coach Rick Schantz was named the USL Championship Coach of the Year Wednesday.</p>
      <p>“Solomon Asante is one of the finest players I have ever worked with as a coach,” said Phoenix Rising head coach Rick Schantz. “We knew from the very beginning that opponents were focused on stopping Solo and yet he was still able to have an MVP season. As much as I hate to admit it, Solo belongs in a higher league, but I will enjoy every minute I get with him."</p>
