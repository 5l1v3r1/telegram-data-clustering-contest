      <h2>Owner of Mirror and Express decides against bidding for 200 regional titles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:30:25+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Patricia Nilsson</a></address>
      <p>The UK’s largest local news group Reach has pulled out of the bidding war for hundreds of JPI Media titles, pausing its aggressive acquisition spree of recent years.</p>
      <p>The group, which was formerly known as Trinity Mirror and last year bought the Express and Star newspapers for £127m, has decided not to go after JPI’s roughly 200 regional titles, according to two people briefed on the negotiations.</p>
      <p>Reach was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/36542bc0-e9b9-11e9-85f4-d00e5018f061">recently seen as a frontrunner </a>in the race to buy assets including the Yorkshire Post and The Scotsman from JPI, which was formerly known as Johnston Press. It has been the country’s most prolific acquirer of regional and local titles in recent years, trying to offset the industry’s dwindling profits by gaining scale, merging resources and cutting costs.</p>
      <p>Bids for JPI’s regional titles have excluded its London-based title, the i, which is the subject of exclusive sale talks with Daily Mail and General Trust, owner of the Daily Mail.</p>
      <p>One person close to the negotiations said Newsquest, the publisher behind The Herald, was now the frontrunner for the bid.</p>
      <p>Observers had previously played down the chances of a Newsquest bid because its US-based owner Gannett is in <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/07fa9fba-b7b5-11e9-8a88-aa6628ac896c">the process of merging with New Media Investments Group</a>, creating the biggest provider of news in the US.</p>
      <p>Newsquest and Reach both declined to comment. JPI Media did not immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Reach’s decision to pull out comes as <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/66723194-b1ce-11e9-8cb2-799a3a8cf37b">new chief executive Jim Mullen </a>said it would launch seven new local news websites in 2020, some which will compete directly with JPI titles.</p>
      <p>The company said it would hire 46 new journalists to help with the push that create new online news sites in locations such as Sheffield, Bolton and Durham.</p>
