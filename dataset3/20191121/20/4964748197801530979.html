      <p>It has been reported that at least <b>10 Mexican citizens</b> have sued <b>Walmart </b>after a <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/mexico-and-united-states-mourn-el-paso-shooting"><b>mass shooting</b></a><b> </b>at a store located in the U.S. border town of <b>El Paso</b>, in <b>Texas</b>. The <b>terrorist attack </b>resulted in the death of 8 Mexicans and left 8 more injured. On Wednesday, Mexico said Walmart didn't do enough to protect its customers.</p>
      <p>In a statement, <b>Mexico</b>’s <a href="https://www.gob.mx/sre/prensa/mexicanos-presentan-demandas-tras-ataque-en-el-paso-texas"><b>Foreign Ministry</b></a> said the lawsuit, which was filed in <b>Texas state court</b> in <b>El Paso County</b>, aimed to hold Walmart accountable “for not taking reasonable and necessary measures to protect its customers.”</p>
      <p>“Through this lawsuit, the petitioners seek <b>justice </b>not only for themselves but also for <b>security </b>for the general public,” the<b> Foreign Ministry</b> said.</p>

      <p>A <b>spokesperson </b>for <b>Walmart </b>said the company has yet to see a copy of the <b>legal document </b>and would respond to it in <b>court</b>.</p>
      <p>“We will never forget this <b>tragic event</b>, and our condolences continue to go out to everyone who was affected,” the company said in a statement. “Safety is a top priority and we care deeply about our associates and customers.”</p>
      <p>The <b>lawsuit </b>is being handled by the <a href="https://coylefirm.com/"><b>Law Office of Lynn Coyle</b></a>, an El Paso-based firm, in collaboration with the <b>Mexican consulate</b> in the city. <b>Lawyers </b>at the firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>It was not clear what relation do the <b>Mexican plaintiffs </b>have to the <a href="https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/english/mexico-open-investigation-terrorism-el-paso-mass-shooting"><b>El Paso shooting</b></a>, although the Ministry noted that Coyle works with the <b>victims </b>of the <b>shooting</b>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.gob.mx/sre/prensa/mexican-families-file-lawsuits-after-attack-in-el-paso-texas?idiom=en"><b>Ministry’s statement</b></a> did not explain on what grounds the <b>plaintiffs </b>seek to hold <b>Walmart </b>responsible for the <b>attack</b>.</p>

      <p>The hate crime in<b> El Paso</b>, followed by a mass <b>shooting </b>in <b>Ohio</b>, sparked a political <b>outcry</b>, with El Paso native and former Democratic presidential contender <b>Beto O’Rourke</b> demanding the mandatory confiscation of the <b>assault rifles</b>, which are often used in <b>mass shootings</b>.</p>
