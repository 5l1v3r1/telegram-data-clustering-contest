      <p>The Jammu and Kashmir Police has repatriated a 32-year-old Pakistani national who had crossed into India through the Line of Control (LoC) along North Kashmir in May.  Police officials said that the Kupwara Police repatriated him as a “goodwill gesture”.</p>
      <p>A J&amp;K Police spokesperson said that the Pakistani national, identified as Shabir Ahmad, a resident of Pajkote in PoK, was repatriated via Teetwal in Kupwara on Thursday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“He was earlier arrested near Dilar check-post in Karnah on May 18 when he had crossed over into Indian territory without seeking requisite permission,” said a police statement.</p>
