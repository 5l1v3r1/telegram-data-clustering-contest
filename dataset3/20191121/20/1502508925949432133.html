      <p>US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao on Thursday granted final approval for an expanded trans-Atlantic joint venture for <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/delta">Delta </a>Air Lines Inc, <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-france">Air France </a>KLM SA and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/virgin-atlantic">Virgin Atlantic.</a></p>
      <p>Reuters first reported Chao's planned tentative approval of the agreement in August.</p>
      <p>The expanded joint venture replaces two previously approved arrangements in the US-United Kingdom and US-Continental Europe markets and will allow for additional benefits such as more options on European flights, Chao said in a statement.</p>
