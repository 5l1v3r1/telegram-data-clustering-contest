      <h1>Borderlands 3 Patch 4 releases today, adds new content, improves stability &amp; more, full patch notes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:34:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:34</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Gearbox has announced that a major new patch for Borderlands 3 will come out later today. According to the team, Update 4 will add some new free content to the game. Moreover, this update packs improvements to stability and User Interface, and re-balances some weapons.</p>
      <p>Going into more details, Borderlands 3’s patch 4 introduces Takedowns at the Maliwan Blacksite and a new challenge, called Mayhem 4. This patch also increases the bank slots for all characters to 20. Not only that, but it adds Dedicated Loot Pools for Bosses and Additional Vending Machines.</p>
      <p>Patch 4 also fixes a lot of crashes, like the multiple crashes that occasionally occurred when interacting with the ECHO menu. Seriously, this patch resolves a lot of crashes so make sure to read its changelog.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, this new update improves overall performance in menus, resolves an issue where occasionally mouse input could be lost, and makes DX12 the default Graphics API on Windows 10 for users with AMD video cards.</p>
      <p>As always, the Epic Games Store will download this patch the next time you launch its client. Below you can also find its huge changelog.</p>
      <h4>Borderlands 3 Patch 4 Release Notes</h4>
      <blockquote>END GAME CHARACTER BALANCE<br/>For this patch, we adjusted many passives involving companions such as Iron Bear, Digi-Clone, and FL4K pets in general. We wanted to increase their viability for later levels of Mayhem while also targeting some passives that were underperforming compared to some others. Iron Bear saw increases to the base scaling and additional bonuses were added through passives and augments. We allowed some of Zane’s kill-skill bonuses to stack up to two times, increasing their output under certain conditions. FL4K pets also saw some increases over level to their damage so that they didn’t feel underpowered for Mayhem Mode. We are currently happy with the variety of Amara’s builds, but we are always monitoring feedback and will adjust if necessary.<br/><br/><b>Moze<br/></b><br/>   •  Iron Bear Damage increased per level,
