      <h1>ACC Football Coach Has A Message For ESPN</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:32:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>ACC football has been the subject of derision for much of this season and Pat Narduzzi is sick and damn tired of it.</p>
      <p>Narduzzi delivered a sharp message today to ESPN and others who criticize the league for its lack of balance and overall mediocrity. He even called out the Big Ten in the process.</p>
      <p>Narduzzi urged those at ESPN to “wake up.”</p>

      <p>It is true that Ohio State is the most dominant program in the Big Ten, and has been for a while. However, there is slightly more parity overall in the league.</p>
      <p>Assuming Clemson wins the ACC this year, it would be their fifth consecutive title and sixth in nine seasons. The other three were won by Florida State from 2012-14.</p>
      <p>If Ohio State wins the Big Ten this season, they will have done so for the third year in a row and the fourth time in that same nine-year span. Wisconsin and Michigan State have two titles apiece and Penn State has one in that time frame.</p>
      <p>Have to respect Narduzzi for sticking up for the league though.</p>
