      <p><b>JERUALEM —</b> Israel's attorney general indicted Benjamin Netanyahu on a range of corruption charges on Thursday, the justice ministry announced, potentially spelling an end to the prime minister's decades-long political career.<br/><br/>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit "decided to file charges against the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for offenses of receiving a bribe, fraud, and breach of trust," a ministry statement said.<br/><br/>It said a note of the decision and a copy of the charges had been provided to the premier's lawyers.<br/><br/>Netanyahu, who strongly denies all the charges, becomes the first Israeli prime minister to be indicted while in office.<br/><br/>Mandelblit is due to give a public statement at 1730 GMT, with Netanyahu expected to respond.<br/><br/>Netanyahu is not legally required to resign, only if convicted with all appeals exhausted, but political pressure is likely to be intense.<br/><br/>Netanyahu may now ask the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, to grant him immunity from prosecution.<br/><br/>Rightwinger Netanyahu, who has been in power since 2009, is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and dominates the country's political scene.<br/><br/>The decision comes as Netanayhu, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, is fighting for his political life.<br/><br/>Israeli been without a government for nearly a year, with neither Netanyahu nor his centrist rival Benny Gantz able to form a coalition government following deadlocked elections in April and September. — AFP</p>
