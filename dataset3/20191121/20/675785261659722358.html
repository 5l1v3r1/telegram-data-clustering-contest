      <p>Prince Andrew has been pictured leaving Buckingham Palace looking shell-shocked after a 'crisis summit'.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York, wearing a suit and tie, was seen driving away from the palace this evening with a serious expression on his face.</p>
      <p>When he left his family home to head to the palace earlier today, he had smiled and waved from behind the wheel of his car.</p>
      <p>It was the first time he had appeared in public since announcing he would be stepping away from royal duties last night.</p>
      <p>His ex-wife Sarah Ferguson also dashed to the palace this afternoon, seeming to be in good spirits as she chatted to a Metropolitan Police officer.</p>

      <p>Footage showed her in the back of a car after being driven to the palace, where attended a 'crisis summit' with the Duke, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7711571/Prince-Andrews-ex-wife-Sarah-Ferguson-arrives-Buckingham-Palace.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>This comes shortly after the Mirror revealed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew</a> has cancelled an upcoming trip to Bahrain.</p>
      <p>The Duke had planned to fly to Bahrain at the weekend for a Pitch@Palace charity event despite the continued crisis, it is understood.</p>

      <p>Andrew quit his life as a working royal on Wednesday evening over his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Asked if the Duke of York was right to step back from public life, Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters on a visit to Bedfordshire: "All I can say is that it is very important that all the victims of Jeffrey Epstein get justice and the law must be done and must be seen to be done."</p>
      <p>Pressure had been mounting on the duke in the wake of his so-called 'car crash' Newsnight interview, with a growing number of multimillion-pound businesses, universities and charities distancing themselves from him and Pitch@Palace.</p>

      <p>He faced criticism for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the financier, who took his own life while in prison earlier this year awaiting trial on sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.</p>
      <p>In the interview, the duke denied claims that he slept with Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's victims, on three separate occasions, twice while she was a teen.</p>
      <p>It is thought the duke will not have any involvement with the dozens of charities, organisations and military units he is associated with.</p>
      <p>The duke is to continue working on his flagship project Pitch@Palace but will do so privately without the support of Buckingham Palace, it emerged earlier today.</p>
      <p>A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman told the PA news agency on Thursday: "He will continue to work on Pitch but will look at how to do that outside and entirely separate from the palace."</p>
