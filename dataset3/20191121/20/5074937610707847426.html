      <p>Nkawie, (Ash), Nov. 21, GNA – A 32-year-old unlicensed driver who drove dangerously under the influence of alcohol at Sepaase in the Atwima-Nwabiagya South Municipality, has been sentenced to a fine of GH¢960.00 by the Nkawie Circuit Court.</p>
      <p>Atta Osei, pleaded guilty to the charge and would serve 24 months imprisonment in default of payment of the fine.</p>
      <p>Police Chief Inspector Noah Oteng Asiedu told the Court presided over by Mr Michael Johnson Abbey that, the complainant was a police officer at the Ashanti Regional Police Command.</p>
      <p>He said on November 19 this year, at about 0830 hours, the complainant spotted the convict, who was in-charge of a private truck with registration number BA 475-11 at Sepaase, driving dangerously and suspected he was drunk.</p>
      <p>Inspector Asiedu said the complainant stopped and arrested the convict and after an alcohol test, his intake was found to be way higher than what was permitted by the law.</p>
      <p>He was therefore charged and brought before the Court.</p>
