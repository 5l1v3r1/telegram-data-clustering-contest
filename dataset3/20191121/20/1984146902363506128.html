        <figcaption>Why the next six weeks will define Newcastle's season</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Newcastle United are "quietly confident" of agreeing a new deal with Matty Longstaff.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Steve Bruce has fired a warning to his former employers, and the Magpies may be forced into a defensive reshuffle.</p>
      <p>Here are your top Newcastle United headlines for November 21:</p>
      <h3>Longstaff deal latest</h3>
      <p>Steve Bruce is 'quietly confident' <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/matty-longstaff">Matty Longstaff</a> will sign a new contract with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>Longstaff's current deal runs out next summer and one of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce's</a> immediate priorities has been to tie down the 19-year-old to a new long-term deal.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It was been a remarkable few months for Longstaff, who left a big impression on Bruce during the club's pre-season tour of China, and just a few weeks after scoring on his Premier League debut against <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , the midifelder made his international bow for England's under-20s.</p>
      <p>Lee Charnley, the Magpies' managing director, has been speaking to a number of players' representatives about new deals in recent months and Bruce is confident a breakthrough is imminent.</p>
      <h3>Bruce's warning to Villa</h3>
      <p>Steve Bruce admits it was a 'privilege' to manage Aston Villa but the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> head coach understandably wants to go back and beat his former side - and it's as 'simple as that'.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old spent two years at Villa Park and led his former club to the play-offs in 2018 but the Villans missed out on promotion back to the Premier League after losing the final against Fulham.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce</a> was sacked five months later after Villa won just one of their previous nine league games and a fan threw a cabbage at him before his final match in charge against Preston.</p>
      <p>Successor Dean Smith led Villa back to the top-flight with largely the same squad and Bruce is now preparing for his first trip back to B6 on Monday night.</p>
      <h3>Injury latest</h3>
      <p>Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar are available to play for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> against Aston Villa - but <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ciaran-clark">Ciaran Clark</a> picked up a knock on international duty and Matt Ritchie remains sidelined.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/florian-lejeune">Lejeune</a> has not played for the Magpies' first team since tearing his anterior cruciate ligament back in April while Schar has been out with a sore knee for a month.</p>

      <p>Newcastle are blessed with plenty of options at centre-back but skipper <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jamaal-lascelles">Jamaal Lascelles</a> is out until the New Year with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>And with Clark a doubt ahead of the trip to Villa Park, Lejeune and Schar are both in contention to start under the lights on Monday night.</p>
      <h3>Wijnaldum's advice to Willems</h3>
      <p>Jetro Willems has revealed the role Gini Wijnaldum played in convincing him to join <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old made the season-long switch to <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James' Park</a> in the summer, and there is a £10 million option at the end of the season for the Magpies to make the move from Eintracht Frankfurt permanent.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The Dutchman has impressed on the left flank in the absence of Matt Ritchie, and has admitted in interview he was convinced to swap the Bundesliga for Premier League football on Tyneside by former Magpie Wijnaldum.</p>
      <p>The midfielder spent one season in black and white before leaving for Liverpool in 2016 following United's relegation.</p>
      <p>But despite the Magpies' difficulties on the pitch that season, Wijnaldum gave the club a glowing review to his fellow Dutchman.</p>
      <h3>Carroll bamboozles Joelinton</h3>
      <p>This is the hilarious moment Andy Carroll bamboozled Joelinton and left the £40 million man on his backside during a recent <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> training session.</p>
      <p>The Geordie frontman posted the brilliant video on Instagram on Thursday afternoon to his Brazilian team-mate with the caption "Nope Not Today".</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article17294641.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_211119Carroll.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>In the short clip during a training exercise, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/andy-carroll">Carroll</a> manages to nick the ball from his fellow forward before creating space with a Cruyff turn.</p>
      <p>Undeterred, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joelinton">Joelinton</a> shows determination to win the ball back for his side - only to be left on his backside when the former Liverpool and West Ham United striker performs another quick turn.</p>
      <p>Carroll nonchalantly then picks out a pass to a team-mate, before checking on the fallen Brazilian and helping him to his feet.</p>
      <h3>Goals of the decade</h3>
      <p>In less than six weeks' time, another turbulent decade at Newcastle United will draw to a close.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> have twice won the Championship title, suffered relegation from the Premier League - a year after narrowly avoiding the drop on the last day - as well as almost qualifying for the Champions League, reaching the quarter-finals of the Europa League and twice reaching the last eight of the League Cup.</p>
      <p>The Magpies have gone through six managers in the last 10 years, each with contrasting fortunes, but there have been great goals and great moments along the way.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>When deciding on a top 10 goals of the decade, the decision was not only made on the quality of the strike, but also its significance and the emotion they evoked.</p>
      <p>We managed to whittle down a top 10 from a 34-goal shortlist and there will more than likely be some other goals we have also forgotten about.</p>
      <p>Here's a look at the 10 Newcastle United goals we managed to settle on.</p>
