      <p>Sunyani, Nov. 21, GNA - Road crashes have killed 252 people in the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo regions this year.</p>
      <p>Last year 188 deaths were recorded, Superintendent Stephen Tenkorang, the Regional Commander of the Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) of the Ghana Police Service, said on Thursday.</p>

      <p>It is being held under the theme: "Stop road accident before it kills you". </p>
      <p>In collaboration with the Driver Vehicle and Licensing Authority (DVLA), the MTTD and other road agencies, the campaign seeks to intensify road safety enforcements and education on major highways and accident prone areas in the regions.</p>
      <p>Superintendent Tenkorang said driver errors have been identified as major contributory factors to road crashes in the regions.</p>
      <p>He cautioned commercial drivers against over-speeding, wrongful overtaking and drunk driving to control road accidents before, during and beyond the Christmas festivities.</p>
      <p>Mr Martin Obeng, the Sunyani West Municipal Chief Executive, said effective collaboration was required among all key stakeholders to stem road crashess.</p>
      <p>He said passengers, drivers and pedestrians have equal roles and responsibilities to play in controlling crashes and advised passengers to check drivers against careless driving.</p>
      <p>Mr Obeng urged the police to intensify enforcements to bring sanity on the highways.</p>
      <p>Mr Kwasi Agyenim Boateng, the Bono, Bono East and Ahafo Regional Head of the NRSA said the Authority would select and train 800 drivers in the three regions.</p>
      <p>He reminded drivers that the weather would not be favourable as the dry season sets in, and advised them to always check their brakes, tyres and lighting systems before journeying.</p>
      <p>Mr Boateng also advised passengers to always wear seat belts whenever they board vehicles.</p>
