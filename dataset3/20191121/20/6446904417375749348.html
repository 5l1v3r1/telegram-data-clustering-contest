      <h1>'It's a tainted investigation': Benjamin Netanyahu's reaction as he's indicted on fraud and bribery</h1>
      <h2>The Israeli prime minister has called the allegations part of a witch-hunt.</h2>

      <p>ISRAEL’S ATTORNEY GENERAL has formally charged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a series of corruption scandals.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued an indictment charging Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and bribery. </p>
      <p>The allegations against Mr Netanyahu include suspicions that he accepted hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends, offered to trade favours with a newspaper publisher, and used his influence to help a wealthy telecoms magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has called the allegations part of a witch-hunt, lashing out against the media, police, prosecutors and the justice system.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu rejected the indictment this evening and said the country is witnessing an “attempted coup” against him.</p>
      <p>In a defiant statement, Netanyahu said the indictment stemmed from “false accusations” and a systematically “tainted investigation”.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu was unable to form a government following unprecedented back-to-back elections this year, in part because of his legal woes, and a third vote could be held within months.</p>
      <p>His main political rival said the indicted prime minister has “no public or moral mandate to make fateful decisions for the state of Israel”.</p>
      <p>Former army chief Benny Gantz said in a statement the indictment raises concerns that Netanyahu “will make decisions in his own personal interest and for his political survival and not in the national interest”.</p>
