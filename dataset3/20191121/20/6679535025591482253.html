      <p>The Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission on Thursday submitted a report to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, suggesting a new law to check forcible religious conversions.</p>
      <p>“The report was submitted along with a draft legislation, Uttar Pradesh Freedom of Religion Bill, 2019,” Law Commission Secretary Sapna Tripathi said.</p>
      <p>The report was prepared after going through pre and post-Independence laws in the country and neighbouring countries besides keeping in mind court judgments.</p>
      <p>“The commission is of the view that existing legal provisions are not enough to check religious conversion and on this serious matter, a new law is needed like in 10 other States,” the report said.</p>
