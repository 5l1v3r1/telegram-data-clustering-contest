      <h1>Newcastle United youngster Adam Wilson opens up on injury nightmare as he nears return to action</h1>
      <h2>Adam Wilson could feature for NUFC U23s for the first time since January 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew Musgrove</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United youngster Adam Wilson is nearing return to action after nearly 10 months out with injury.</p>
      <p>The forward's last outing was against rivals Sunderland in January where he succumbed to ankle injury before being ruled out further with a recurring thigh injury.</p>
      <p>But the 19-year-old is now in contention for the U23s game this Friday in the Premier League international cup against Benfica.</p>
      <p>Wilson, who has been capped at U18 level for England, has spoken about his return to fitness.</p>
      <p>"It's been a long time since I played a competitive game.</p>
      <p>"I've been struggling with that [thigh] injury ever since. I redone it in Spain during pre-season so it's been a long time out for me which has been very difficult.</p>

      <p>"It's been my first big injury which has been hard but I've had the right people around me and tried to keep the right mindset and keep working hard so I can come back as quick as possible.</p>
      <p>"I've just tried to keep working hard everyday and keep being positive even when it's probably the hardest place to be. The days are all the same, on repeat, and you come in doing the same stuff.</p>
      <p>"You're still with the lads in the changing room so you've got to try not to isolate yourself from everyone else but it can be very tough.</p>
      <p>"It was unbelievable to be back in the squad against Port Vale after being out for so long. I've been training for a couple of weeks and it was great to be back out on the pitch. When you're in the gym, all you see is everybody training outside and you just wish you were out there and you just can't wait to get back into it.</p>
      <p>"When you're actually out there, it feels great and makes you remember you shouldn't ever take anything for granted."</p>
