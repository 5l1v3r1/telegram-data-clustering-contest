      <p>About 6:50pm on Thursday police arrived at the scene in Kootaberra - about 50km north of Port Augusta - where the car left the road.</p>
      <p>The teen was the only occupant in the car.</p>
      <p>The Stuart Hwy was closed in both directions for several hours last night but has since reopened.</p>
      <p>At the same time last year there were 68 deaths on our roads.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile a 13-year-old girl has been arrested for lighting several fires in the southern suburbs as South Australia faces one of its worst start to the bushfire season.</p>
      <p>The fires were lit on Burgess Dr at Noarlunga Downs, Goldsmith Dr and Grey Box Ave at Noarlunga Centre just before 11pm last night.</p>
      <p>A suspect was seen running from the scene before the police helicopter and police dog Axe searched the area.</p>
      <p>Another blaze was reported on Oslo Cres, Hackham West an hour later.</p>
      <p>A Hackham West teenager, 13, will face Christies Beach Magistrates Court charged with causing a bushfire today.</p>
      <p>These fires burnt vegetation, no properties were damaged.</p>
