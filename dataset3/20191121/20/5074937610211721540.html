      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA – Professor Ransford Gyampo and Dr Paul Butakor, both lecturers of the University of Ghana (UG), have been invited to appear before the Disciplinary Committee of the University.</p>
      <p>The invitation centered a ‘prima facie’ evidence of breaches of the University’s Code of Conduct and Statutes as amended found by a fact-finding committee set up to investigate the lecturers over a BBC documentary titled ‘Sex for Grades.”</p>
      <p>A statement signed and copied to the Ghana News Agency by Madam Stella A. Amoa, the Director of Public Affairs, UG, the Committee, chaired by Justice Vida Akoto-Bamfo, a retired Supreme Court Judge noted in its report to the Vice-Chancellor, that there was a prima facie evidence of misconduct against the two lecturers.</p>
      <p>The evidence of misconduct, the statement said, was contrary to Paragraph 6.4 of the ‘Code of Conduct for Academic Staff of the University of Ghana,’ which stipulates that “Academic staff shall at all times comport themselves in ways that will enhance their image and that of the University.”</p>
      <p>The statement said the Committee further found prima facie evidence of misconduct contrary to Statute 42(1)(e)(ii) of the University of Ghana Statutes, which states that, “…no member of the University shall engage in a course of vexatious conduct that is directed at one or more specific individuals, and that is known to be unwelcome…”</p>
      <p>The statement said the Vice-Chancellor has accepted the Committee’s findings and forwarded the report to the Disciplinary Committee for Senior Members, the appropriate adjudicatory body, for immediate action.</p>
      <p>“The University of Ghana reiterates its commitment to rooting out sexual harassment and misconduct and reminds its students and employees of the provisions in its Anti-Sexual Harassment and Misconduct Policy as well as those contained in the Statutes of the UG.</p>
      <p>“The University would like to assure all stakeholders that it will not shield any member of the community found to have contravened these provisions,” the statement said.</p>
