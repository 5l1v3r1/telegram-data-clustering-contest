      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- Shark researchers off the coast of Massachusetts captured video of an expert jumping to avoid a great white shark that jumped out of the water right beneath him.</p>
      <p>The video, posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&amp;v=L3ncQ1S4jxs&amp;feature=emb_title">to YouTube</a> by the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy, shows state shark researcher Greg Skomal using a pole to take underwater GoPro footage of a 9-foot female shark swimming near the vessel.</p>
      <p>The footage shows Skomal jumping when the shark breaches right under where he was standing on the pulpit.</p>
      <p>"White sharks are wild and unpredictable animals," the conservancy said. "This is a good reminder of the importance of following safety tips and always staying vigilant when in or on the water."</p>
