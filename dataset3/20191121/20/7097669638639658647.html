      <p>LAS VEGAS – A police officer shot and wounded a man before dawn Thursday at McCarran International Airport, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>Police received a report of a person who had gone through a security door at Terminal 3, but they did not find anyone there, according to police Capt. Nichole Splinter.</p>
      <p>But police eventually found a man at about 4 a.m. on the terminal next to Terminal 1.</p>
      <p>Police tried to escort the man to a public area, according to authorities, but the man became "extremely irate" and attacked them.</p>
      <p>A police officer was knocked unconscious during the attack.</p>
      <p>As the struggle with the irate suspect unfolded on a tarmac between A and B gates at Terminal 1, another officer fired two rounds and "struck" the man, according to police.</p>
      <p>The unidentified wounded man and the officer were taken to a hospital, where the man was undergoing surgery. The injured officer was treated and released, said Officer Aden OcampoGomez, a department spokesman. The names of the wounded man and the officers were not immediately made public.</p>
      <p>OcampoGomez said police believe the man who was apprehended was the same person who entered the secure area at Terminal 3. It did not appear he had a weapon and it was not immediately clear if he was a traveler, OcampoGomez said.</p>
      <p>The officers were equipped with body-worn cameras and OcampoGomez said the details of the struggle would be made public along with the names of the officers and the wounded man in coming days.</p>
      <p>Carriers using that terminal include American Airlines, Allegiant Air, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines and Contour Airlines, but airport operations and flights appeared to be unaffected. </p>
