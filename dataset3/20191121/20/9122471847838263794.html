      <h1>Report: Patriots Considering Bringing Antonio Brown Back</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:04:13+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this week, former star wide receiver Antonio Brown issued a public apology to New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.</p>
      <p>“Mr.Kraft I apologize sincerely to you and your organization! All I wanted to be was an asset to the organization; sorry for the bad media and the drama ! Thank you sincerely AB,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DZe7jBKcg/">Brown said on Instagram</a>.</p>
      <p>Several Patriots players, including quarterback Tom Brady, liked the apology on social media.</p>
      <p>Immediately after the apology came out, fans wondered if the Patriots would consider re-signing the star wide receiver. Given the team’s struggles on offense over the past few weeks, adding a legitimate star to the receiving corps would certainly help.</p>
      <p>According to a report from former Patriots tight end and current New England analyst Christian Fauria, the Patriots have “kicked the tires” on adding Antonio Brown.</p>
      <p>“I think they have kicked the tires…I know there have been discussions. That’s for sure,” Fauria said.</p>

      <p>Brown played in one game for the Patriots earlier this season. He showed immediate chemistry with Brady, connecting for four receptions for 56 yards and a touchdown.</p>
      <p>However, Brown found himself out of the job just a week later. Will the Patriots take him back?</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for the latest.</p>
