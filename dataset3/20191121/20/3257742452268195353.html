      <h3>Anker PowerPort III Nano</h3>
      <p>If your special someone has an iPhone or an iPad, they'll likely love the <a href="https://amzn.to/2QBSZre">Anker PowerPort III Nano</a> (<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/13/review-the-usb-c-charger-apple-shouldve-shipped-with-the-iphone-11-pro">review</a>). This compact charger is about as small as it gets but has enough power to fast charge their iPhone to 50% in only 30 minutes. With up to 18W of power, that will also fast charge their <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/ipad">iPad</a> or <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/ipad+pro">iPad Pro</a>. <br/><br/>Priced at <b><a href="https://amzn.to/2QBSZre">$19.99 on Amazon</a></b>, this budget-friendly gift can be used as a stocking stuffer or Secret Santa gift easily. Just make sure they have a <a href="https://amzn.to/2KFypT7">USB-C to Lightning cable</a> if being used for their iPhone.</p>

        <figcaption>The 18W Anker PowerPort Nano III is a great gift idea, offering faster charging compared to Apple's 5W charger</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>For even more power, there is the <a href="https://amzn.to/2O4Rsbv">PowerPort III Mini</a> which can output 30W of power in a similarly small design. That is easily enough to not only power an iPhone or iPad, but a 2018 or newer MacBook Air in a size smaller than what Apple bundled. The beefier high-speed charger is currently <b><a href="https://amzn.to/2O4Rsbv">on sale for $25.99</a></b> on Amazon.</p>

Not long after they'll have a perfectly cooked piece of meat without losing any of the flavor.<br/><br/>There are a lot of sous vide cookers out there as the technique grows in popularity, but Anova was one of the first to bring it to the masses and the new Nano model makes it even more compact.
