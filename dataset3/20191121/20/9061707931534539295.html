      <p>Evans' playtime has been limited since arriving from Reading in 2018 due to a number of injury issues.</p>
      <p>The 24-year-old has made just 11 league appearances since arriving at Pride Park, six of those coming this season.</p>
      <p>And Evans himself has admitted just how frustrating his time so far at <a href="http://ytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> has been due to those setbacks.</p>
