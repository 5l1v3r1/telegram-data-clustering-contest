      <p>Lisov pleaded guilty earlier to one charge against him of conspiracy to commit computer hacking.</p>
      <p>Judge Valery Caproni said during the hearing that Lisov was sentenced to 48 months in prison and noted that she gave the Russian national a 15 percent discount for good behaviour.</p>
      <p>In addition, Caproni said the court will factor in the sentence the time Lisov already served since his detention in 2017. In 2017, the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/us/201902231072669577-russia-usa-lisov-guilty/">Spanish authorities detained Lisov in Barcelona</a> and then extradited him to the United States.</p>
      <p>The US authorities said Lisov stole $855,000 by using malware and attempted to carry out illegal financial operations for another $4.4 million. In addition, Lisov is accused of illegally accessing data at financial institutions and selling the data on the black market.</p>
