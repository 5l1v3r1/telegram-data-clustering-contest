      <p>The director of <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/gemma-chan-speaks-crazy-rich-asians-299862"><i>Crazy Rich Asians</i></a> has denied former Disney Channel star Brenda Song's claim she was overlooked for the film because she was not "Asian enough".</p>
      <p>The comedy-drama was a major success on its release last year and was praised for being the first major Hollywood production to feature a majority Asian cast since 1993's The Joy Luck Club.</p>
      <p>However, Song, who is of Thai descent, said she tried to get an audition but missed out because of her appearance.</p>

      <p>The 31-year-old told <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/brenda-song-dollface"><i>Teen Vogue</i></a>: "Their reasoning behind that, what they said was that my image was basically not Asian enough, in not so many words. It broke my heart.</p>
      <p>"I said, 'This character is in her late to mid-20s, an Asian American, and I can't even audition for it? I've auditioned for Caucasian roles my entire career, but this specific role, you're not going to let me do it?'"</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/netflixs-new-thriller-secret-obsession-freaking-viewers-332877"><i>Song</i></a>, known for TV roles including The Suite Life of Zack and Cody where she played London Tipton, added: "You're going to fault me for having worked my whole life? I was like, 'Where do I fit?'".</p>

      <p>Crazy Rich Asians director Jon Chu has now denied he barred Song from auditioning because of her race.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "Would these words ever come out of my mouth? Nope makes no sense. I feel horrible she thinks this is the reason. The fact is I love Brenda Song and am a fan.</p>
      <p>"I didn't need her to audition because I already knew who she was!"</p>
