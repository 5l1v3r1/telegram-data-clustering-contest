      <h1>Mr Eazi Recruits Tyga for Latest Visual &amp; Single, "Tony Montana"</h1>
      <h2>Produced by Killertunes.</h2>

      <p>A few weeks after the debut of his “Call Waiting” single with Joey B, fast-rising young Nigerian artist <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/mr-eazi">Mr Eazi</a> is teaming up with <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/tyga">Tyga</a> for another high-profile collaborative cut. Dubbed “Tony Montana,” Mr Eazi’s latest single features collaboration from Killertunes, while its visual component comes to us courtesy of director Mahaneela.</p>
      <p>“I started as a promoter, that’s how I got into being an artist,” Mr Eazi previously shared with us, opening up about his origins for a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/mreazi-interview-micline-episode-40">September edition</a> of our <i>MIC/LINE</i> podcast series. “Me and my manager, we were like competitors, then we started doing events together … it’s in our blood, and also, it’s good business … Business is sharks, and you have to be smart.”</p>
      <p>“There’s no publishing structure,” Mr Eazi continued, sharing some insight into his region’s musical landscape. “There’s no label services coming into Africa, not one. There’s the need to start building all of this, and that’s what emPawa is trying to do. I’m trying to build that ecosystem. When you build the ecosystem, you’re going to eat. You’re going to break bread. If I don’t break the ecosystem, someone else will build it at the premium and sell back to me.”</p>
