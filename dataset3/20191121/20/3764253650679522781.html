      <p>Hours after the sacking of four emirs installed by Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano state, some residents of Kano communities are currently embarking on a protest, according to the report by Premium times.</p>
      <p><b>Legit.ng</b> reported how the Kano high court nullified the creation of four new first-class emirates by the state government.</p>
      <p>The four new emirates for which Governor Ganduje named first-class emirs in the state in May are Bichi, Rano, Karaye and Gaya.</p>
      <p>Justice Usman Na’Abba ruled on Thursday, November 21, that the law creating the new emirates did not follow due process.</p>
      <p>After the judgement, scores of residents of Karaye, one of the affected areas, trooped out to protest the judgement.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It was gathered that a similar protest is ongoing in Gaya.</p>
      <p>According to the report, there are unconfirmed reports that similar protests were holding in other emirates.</p>
      <p>The online news platform said that in Karaye, the residents carried placards, whose contents were in Hausa, to show their grievances at the judgment.</p>
      <p><i>“Leave us in our new emirate, the Karaye emirate,”</i> one of the placards reads.</p>
      <p><i>“The people of Karaye are in support of the new emirate,”</i> another placard reads.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> had previously reported that <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277775-court-nullifies-creation-4-additional-kano-emirates.html">the appointment and creation of four additional </a>emirates in the state was on Thursday, November 21, nullified by a state high court.</p>
      <p>It was reported that while delivering the verdict, Justice Usman Na’abba, the presiding judge, declared the creation of the four emirates did not follow due process.</p>
