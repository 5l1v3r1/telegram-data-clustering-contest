      <h1>FanMilk Limited donates dustbins to schools</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:31:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author">Grace Princess Tarwo/Jacqueline Appiagyei, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 21, GNA-The Fan Milk Ghana Limited on Thursday donated dustbins to some schools in Accra for participating in the FanChoco School Caravan initiated to promote sanitation and segregation of waste.    </p>
      <p>The Caravan was initiated in September 2018 in partnership with the Ghana Education Service to educate pupils and parents on nutrition, physical activity and sensitise them on the essence of sanitation.</p>
      <p>The programme was piloted with 50 schools and scaled up to over 149 schools both in the Ashanti and Greater Accra Regions. </p>
      <p>It also gave the kids the opportunity to engage in the wrapper collection promo as a drive to reduce indiscriminate disposal of plastic waste in schools.</p>
      <p>Ms Frances Nadhia Aryee, the Brand Manager Fan Milk Ghana Limited presenting the dustbins said the gesture was to promote sanitation and waste segregation in basic schools to recycle them for other purposes.</p>
      <p>She said the company in collaboration with the Ghana Recycle Initiative by Private Enterprises called ‘Pick-It’ with a centre, where waste was segregated to remove plastics that were recycled and produced other materials.  </p>
      <p>She said the company commissioned a urinary Unit in Kumasi in the Ashanti Region built from plastic blocks due to the importance of recycling.</p>
      <p>Ms Aryee hoped to expand the initiative to reach a larger number of children in the country to enable them to practise waste management from a younger age adding that children tend to keep things they learn for long at their early stages.</p>
      <p>“Train up a child the way he should go and when he grows will not depart from it”, she said.</p>
      <p>Mr Isaac MacCarthy-Mensah, the Municipal Director of Education, La Dade-Kotopon commended the company for the kind act adding that it was the vision of the President to make Accra the cleanest city in Africa and saw the gesture to be expedient.</p>
      <p>He assured that the bins would be used for the intended purpose and enable Fan Milk to achieve its aim in ensuring sanity in the Assembly.</p>
      <p>Nana Esi Inkoom, the National School Health Education Programme Coordinator, advised the pupils to put the FanChoco plastics and other plastic waste in the bins adding that once they practise that, they would do some at home which would in turn create a clean environment and a clean nation.</p>
      <p>Two students from La Wireless Cluster of Schools; Isaac Kweku in class five and Rebecca Ajutuak in JHS two who gathered the most wrappers were awarded FanChoco branded school supplies.</p>
