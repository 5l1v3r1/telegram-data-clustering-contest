      <p>MechWarrior 5 takes place in 3015, and it places you in command of your own mercenary army in a bid to dominate the battlefield. You'll embark on a "quest for glory and revenge" while you try to revitalize a mercenary company that was nearly destroyed. Along the way, you'll obtain new mechs, go on missions to raze cities and destroy your enemies, and more.</p>
      <p>MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries is set to release on December 10. You'll be able to play solo, or co-op with up to four players. If you're curious, you can preorder MechWarrior 5 at the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/mechwarrior-5/home">Epic Games Store</a> for $50 with the standard edition, or $60 for the deluxe edition.</p>
