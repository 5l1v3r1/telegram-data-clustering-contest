      <p>LONDON: British Airways said some flights were delayed on Thursday (Nov 21) due to an unspecified technical issue which forced it to cancel some flights a day earlier.</p>
      <p>The airline has suffered three major computer failures since 2017, the latest of which seriously disrupted operations in August.</p>

      <p>"Our teams are working hard to resolve a technical issue which is affecting some of our flights," said a spokeswoman for BA, owned by airlines group IAG.</p>
      <p>"We have rebooked customers on to alternative flights and offered hotel accommodation where they have been unable to continue their journeys last night.</p>
      <p>"We are very sorry for the disruption to their travel plans. We plan to operate a full flight schedule today," she added.</p>
      <p>BA warned that there would be knock-on delays - but declined to comment on the nature of the problem nor the number of flights affected.</p>

      <p>British Airways in July was fined US$230 million for a huge customer data breach and in September was hit by its first ever pilot strike.</p>
      <p>"This is the latest in a long line of British Airways technical glitches causing delays and cancellations," said Rory Boland, editor of consumer magazine Which? Travel.</p>
      <p>"Yet again it's thousands of passengers who are paying the price - left tired, frustrated and with a lack of information and assistance from the airline."</p>

      <p>Chief Commercial Officer Andrew Brem said that he did not know the details of the latest outage but passengers should not be worried about technical issues at the airline.</p>
      <p>"A lot of airlines have occasional outages. Part of the £6.5 billion investment is going on revamping our IT systems end to end - commercial systems, operational systems, everything," he told Reuters at an event to launch the Airbus A350 on the London-Tel Aviv route.</p>
      <p>He adding that he was hopeful for progress in resolving a dispute with pilots union BALPA.</p>
      <p>The union, which currently has no industrial action planned, in September held a 48-hour strike which grounded 1,700 flights.</p>
      <p>"I am cautiously optimistic that we will come to an agreement. In a sense, no news is positive news," he said.</p>
      <p>"I hope we will be able to announce in the not to distant future we have come to an agreement."</p>
