        <li>JCB, a British tractor maker, has created a new version of the world’s fastest tractor: the Fastrac Two.</li>
        <li>The tractor achieved a speed of over 135 mph, breaking the world record that was held by its first iteration, the Fastrac One.</li>

      <p>JCB has created the world’s fastest tractor: the Fastrac Two, which achieved 135.19 mph.</p>
      <p>JCB is a manufacturing company that specializes in construction and agricultural equipment. It currently has a range of over 300 products made in 22 plants worldwide, operating in countries like the US, China, and the UK.</p>
      <p>The original Fastrac – aptly named the Fastrac One – was deemed the “world’s fastest tractor” after it set the record in June, achieving the title at a speed that was over 30 mph slower than the Two’s record.</p>
      <p>“When we reached 103.6 mph with the Fastrac in the summer, I was convinced we could go even faster, and the JCB team has risen to the challenge by setting this new record,” JCB chairman Lord Anthony Bamford said in a statement. “It’s an amazing achievement delivered by a young and enthusiastic engineering team. Everyone involved should be very proud of the part they have played in showing off JCB engineering at its very best.”</p>
      <p>The second iteration of the Fastrac tractor family is stronger, more streamlined, and 10% lighter than its predecessor, according to JCB. The world record run was done at Elvington Airfield in the UK.</p>
      <p>The manufacturing company is no stranger to breaking world records. The “Land Speed Record” for diesel-powered cars was set in 2006 with <a href="https://www.jcbdieselmax.com/">JCB’s Dieselmax,</a> which achieved 350.092 mph.</p>
