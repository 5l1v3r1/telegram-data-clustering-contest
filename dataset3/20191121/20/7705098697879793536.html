      <h1>J.J. Abrams Reacts To George Lucas’ Star Wars Regrets</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:10:45+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:10</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>George Lucas has made it clear in the past that he’s not particularly a fan of the new <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars</b></a> films. But director J.J. Abrams has a pretty good idea as to why Lucas feels that way. During an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/star-wars-jj-abrams-secrets-of-skywalker-912362/">Rolling Stone</a>, Abrams shared his thoughts on the matter.</p>
      <p>“It’s probably a complicated thing for him,” said Abrams regarding Lucas selling <b>Star Wars</b> to Disney in 2012. “To decide you’re going to sell this thing that you created, that was your baby, to anyone. That must be more complicated than signing a check and smiling about it.”</p>
      <p>However, Lucas hasn’t completely given a cold shoulder to the new films. Abrams noted that “he’s been incredibly gracious” and “super-generous,” during a meeting they had while <b>The Force Awakens </b>was filming.</p>

      <p>“Do I wish that [<b>The</b> <b>Force Awakens</b>] had been his favorite movie of all time? Yes, I only wanted to do well by him,” added Abrams. “I would just say that I have nothing but profound respect for the guy and am still truly, even more so now, working on these movies in awe of what he created.” </p>
      <p>Regarding the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tv/471291-bob-iger-says-george-lucas-is-fine-with-the-mandalorian">recent release of the Disney+ series <b>The Mandalorian</b></a>, Bob Iger noted that “George has been fine” with its treatment.</p>
