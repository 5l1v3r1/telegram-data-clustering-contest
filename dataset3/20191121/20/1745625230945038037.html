      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> let loose with a huge laugh as she rolled around on a couch with her daughter, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/north-west/">North West</a>. The black-and-white <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/Instagram/">Instagram</a> photo, which Kim credited to famous fashion photographer Mario Testino, showed pure joy as the 39-year-old celebrity mom and her 6-year-old daughter laughed together.</p>
      <p>For the shoot, Kim wore a white terrycloth robe with long sleeves and a thick belt, while North was dressed in a trendy white top with cutout shoulders and short sleeves. Both of these <i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i> stars rocked straight dark hair, their long tresses parted down the middle.</p>
      <p>The younger member of the family wasn’t wearing any makeup, likely because her dad, Kanye West, has <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5711916/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-north-makeup/">strictly ruled</a> it out until North becomes a teen. However, Kim is old enough to don as much makeup as she desires. In this instance, she rocked darkened and tapered brows, long black lashes, smoky shadow and subtle lipstick.</p>
      <p>In the image, which Kim captioned “Best Friends!,” she lovingly covers her daughter’s little hand as North puts her tiny fist of fingers near her mom’s arm. North’s other hand rests near Kim’s neck.</p>
      <p>The resulting photo clearly shows the strong and loving bond between the two generations of women, as well as their remarkable resemblance to each other.</p>
