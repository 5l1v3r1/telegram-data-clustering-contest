      <p><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/south-wales-police">South Wales Police</a> confirmed officers attended a property in Gower View Road, <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/gorseinon">Gorseinon</a>, on Thursday at around 3.15pm after concerns were raised about the welfare of the occupant, who refused to leave.</p>
      <p>The fire service also attended and, due to concerns for their safety, a number of neighbours were evacuated and the road was closed.</p>
      <p>At around 7pm a 36-year-old man was arrested for threats to cause damage by arson.</p>
