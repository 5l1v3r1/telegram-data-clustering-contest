      <p>Robbie Williams has said he will be voting for the first time in the upcoming election - but refused to reveal which party he is backing.</p>
      <p>The star, 45, has previously claimed to have never voted but suggested the current race made it too "entertaining" not to.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Winter Wonderland in London's Hyde Park, the former Take That singer described the political debate as a "minefield".</p>
      <p>He added that he would be "glued" to the television on the night of December 12.</p>
      <p>Williams said: "This is a minefield. Did you see how much shit James Blunt got into the other week just by saying the wrong thing?</p>
      <p>"I couldn't possibly say. The next question is: 'Who?' I couldn't possibly say the right thing to that question.</p>

      <p>"Do you know what? It is going to be really entertaining. That's how much I know about the run-up to this election and the night itself.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to be glued to the television like everybody else. And 'yes', the answer is.</p>
      <p>"The first time I will be voting is in this election. I have now got the right to vote by post. But I'm not saying who."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Williams performed five songs including Feel, Angels and a number of Christmas tunes during a surprise show at the opening of Winter Wonderland on Thursday.</p>
      <p>He was promoting The Christmas Present, his new festive album.</p>
      <p>The last series of the X Factor saw Williams and and his wife Ayda Field appear on the judging panel along Louis Tomlinson.</p>
      <p>However, the couple were not invited to return as judges on Simon Cowell's new venture, X Factor: Celebrity.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Williams suggested this was because of their fee and said he planned to talk to Cowell about it when they meet before Christmas.</p>
      <p>He said: "Look, it's expensive. We are expensive. Something has got to give there.</p>
      <p>"Maybe they did think about us, maybe they didn't. I don't know what is on Simon's mind.</p>
      <p>"But I will be meeting up with him before Christmas and I will try to get it out of him."</p>
      <p>Williams hopes to bolster his chances of securing the top spot this December with two live dates at Wembley's SSE Arena in London on December 16 and 17.</p>
