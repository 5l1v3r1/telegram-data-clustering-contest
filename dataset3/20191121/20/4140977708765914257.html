            <b>KAR Vs JHA Dream11 Team : Rampant Karnataka look to emulate their resplendent display from yesterday and make it two wins on the bounce.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Coming into the revered land of the Super League stage of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy 2019 having won five out of their six encounters in Group A, Karnataka had ended up earning a spot in the echelons of the top contenders. It was one which came not only due to their exceptional form in this tournament but the fact that this was a side which had also ended up winning the foregone Vijay Hazare Trophy.</p>
          <p>And the team ensured that they continued their rapturous form when they played their first Super League contest against Tamil Nadu yesterday as well with the side marauding their way to a sublime and pristine 9 wicket win. In what was a terrific display in all the departments of the game, the team ended up walking all over their opponents as they chased down the 159 run target at hand with 9 wickets and over 3 overs in hand.</p>

                <p>When they take on Jharkhand who were defeated yesterday, Karnataka will be making an advent into the encounter quietly confident of cruising to yet another win and further consolidating their first spot in Group B of the Super League. This is a Jharkhand side which was ripped into and blown apart by 109 runs by Punjab as they faltered and fell apart in their pursuit of 200 to register a mere and sorry 90 runs on the scoreboard.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>We perhaps couldn’t have augured for a more august and sanctum wicket for this encounter with this being a track where the ball bounces at just the right height with the batsmen being accorded all the room in the world to cream the ball to the fence. With over 400 runs being scored here yesterday, this promises to be another behemoth scoring affair with the team winning the toss all set to come out and bat first.</p>

                            <h3>KAR Vs JHA Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>We have decided to venture into today’s encounter with Karnataka’s wicket-keeper, Luvnith Sisodia. The player is selected by us due to two reasons with him being someone capable of not only making the most of the death overs but also given his role with the gloves which will see him rope in a hoard of points through catches and stumpings.</p>
                            <h3>KAR Vs JHA Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>We carry on with the picks from Karnataka’s batting order with Manish Pandey being the first name to be inducted in our Dream 11 side after the bat played out a steady knock yesterday to ensure his side were able to register a clinical run chase. Opener Devdutt Padikal comes in as well from the side along with Karun Nair with the two managing to stand tall amongst a batting order which is imbued with some stellar performers given their recent showings.</p>
                            <p>From Jharkhand meanwhile we have opted for their leading run getter with Virat Singh being imbedded in our side for this one. The player is the side’s leading run getter as thing stand with his 253 runs being quintessential to the side’s journey till here, a display his side will be ardently wishing he can avidly regale them in today as well.</p>
                            <h3>KAR Vs JHA Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>The one player apiece from either side with Anand Singh being the first name to be brought in from Jharkhand. The player comes mainly due to his displays with the bat, ones which have seen him take the onus of delivering incisive displays and holding fort for the side persistently from one end.</p>
                            <p>From Karnataka we have decided to go in with Pavan Deshpande, a player who is being brought into our side owing to the brand of spin he will be sending out, one which will entice Jharkhand to go after him and see him getting wickets today.</p>
                            <h3>KAR Vs JHA Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>His spin counterpart, legspinner Shreyas Gopal is also being brought in from the side by us owing to the same reasoning alongside V Koushik. These are two bowlers who are going to reign supreme against an adverse and dwindling batting unit, one which is bound to lose its way and bow down infront of these two names.</p>
                            <p>From Jharkhand meanwhile we are going in with their opener Utkarsh Singh as the first name with the player being a mainstay of ther batting unit. He might have been classified as a specialist bowler but the player is much more than that with his role as a stellar bat seeing him earn a place in our side for the day. </p>
                            <p>Spinner Shahbaz Nadeem is brought in as well by us to wrap up our day’s proceedings for this Dream 11 encounter.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Padikal will lead our side out as the captain pick whilst Pandey is being selected as the vice-captain.</p>
