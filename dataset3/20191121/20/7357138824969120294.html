      <p>The House Judiciary Committee passed a bill that would effectively make marijuana legal, the National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) announced in a <a href="https://thecannabisindustry.org/press-releases/house-judiciary-committee-approves-bill-to-end-marijuana-prohibition/">press release</a>. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2019, which was introduced by Rep. Jerrold Nadler and co-sponsored by over 50 lawmakers, passed by a count of 24-10.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Online platforms have to ensure that product listings on their sites are properly verified, as the fallout from failing to do so even once can have devastating impacts. This is especially the case for facilitators of services or products like homesharing rentals, where potential buyers could be stranded in an unfamiliar city or sellers could be cheated out of potential revenue in the case of a false listing. Managing the isolation and removal of these false listings is key to user trust, according to Chung-Man Tam, CEO of P2P business travel booking site <a href="https://www.2ndaddress.com/">2nd Address</a>.</p>

      <p>For merchants, divining the future of payments means looking around corners, considering what consumers want and will want and then laying the technological groundwork beforehand. In an interview with Karen Webster during a recent PYMNTS Masterclass, Amy Parsons, senior vice president of global acceptance at Discover Financial Services and its payments brand, Discover Global Network, said taking the long view means merchants need to change the way they think about payments.</p>
