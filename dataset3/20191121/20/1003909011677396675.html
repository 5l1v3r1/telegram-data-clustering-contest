      <p>Edmonton’s Plains Cree band nehiyawak, Winnipeg First Nations singer-songwriter Richard Inman, and Saskatchewan’s Onion Lake Cree Nation DJ Tchutchu will also perform.</p>
      <p>“I set out to make sure we had a nice range of artists of African descent and styles,” said Calgary Folk Music Festival artistic director Kerry Clarke. “In general, with programming in the two festivals I’m aiming to have a really significant number of Indigenous artists and that’s an ongoing strategy.”</p>

      <p>Koyczan is one of the country’s most renowned poets and spoken-word artists. A 2017 documentary chronicled the Vancouver-based artist’s reconciliation with his Indigenous father.</p>
      <p>“You can’t really pigeonhole him into spoken-word,” Clarke says. “He’s a storyteller. There’s something infinitely powerful about how he presents and what he says.”</p>
