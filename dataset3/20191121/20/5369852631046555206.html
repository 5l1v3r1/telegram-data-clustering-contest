      <p>A REGIONAL LEAGUE footballer in Germany was today banned for three years, and his club suspended for six months, after he punched a referee who had just sent him off.</p>
      <p>The player from FSV Muenster has been charged with assault and banned from playing by the governing body in Hesse for punching the referee in a regional league game against TV Semd last month.</p>
      <p>The official was knocked out by the punch and had to be airlifted to hospital.</p>

      <p>The Muenster club in west Germany has also been suspended from playing for six months and fined €500.</p>
      <p>“Something like that does not belong on a sports pitch and the three-years are fully justified, it was the highest possible penalty,” Theodor Greiner of the Hessian Football Association (HFV), told AFP.</p>

      <p>Greiner suspects the three-year ban handed to the player “could well be changed to life” when the HFV meets at the weekend.</p>
      <p>FSV Muenster immediately suspended their team from playing after the incident and the club’s president has said the player responsible will be held liable for the fine.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, there was a separate violent incident in the German lower leagues when a cup semi-final in south-west Germany was called off after an assistant referee was knocked to the ground during the match.</p>
