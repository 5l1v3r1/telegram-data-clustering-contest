      <p>Crystal Jakobetz, 37, and her 18-year-old daughter Dakota were arrested on Friday as they allegedly tried to to steal groceries from a Walmart in Wichita Falls, Texas.</p>
      <p>Police responded to a theft call from the store and watched Jakobetz and her daughter at a self-checkout kiosk, scanning some items, while placing numerous un-scanned items in their shopping cart.</p>
