          <b>Game of Thrones' Kristofer Hivju has revealed an alternate ending was filmed for the finale of the show.Â </b>

      </p>
      <p>It's been more than six months since the HBO epic came to an end.</p>
      <p>But the series' eight season proved to be pretty divisive, with many fans even petitioning to have the last six episodes remade.</p>
      <p>Kristofer, who played Tormund Giantsbane, recently told Metro how things could have played out way differently. Namely, because an alternate ending to the series was filmed - although it's unlikely fans will ever see it.</p>

      <p>He told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/?ito=newsnow-feed"><i>Metro</i></a>: "Well, we shot an alternative ending. That was mostly for fun but I don't know if I'm allowed to tell you about that."</p>
      <p>Although he kept quiet as to what the alternate ending involved, he did admit that it was "fun".</p>
      <p>Hivju's admission comes a few weeks after HBO ordered a Game of Thrones prequel series, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/entertainment/game-thrones-prequel-cancelled-hbo-fears-alienate-viewers-341913"><i>House of the Dragon</i></a>.</p>

      <p>The new series, which will be set 300 years before the events of the aforementioned show, will tell the story of the Targaryens in Westeros, long before the Mad King, <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/movies-tv/emilia-clarke-told-perform-nude-scenes-343631"><i>Daenery's reign</i></a>, and her eventual fall from grace.</p>
      <p>Series one will have 10 episodes and will be co-produced by Game of Thrones author George RR Martin, as well as Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik.</p>
