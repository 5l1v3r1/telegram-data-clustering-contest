      <p>A MAN has been rushed to hospital after allegedly being stabbed multiple times at a pub on the Gold Coast overnight.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the 21-year-old victim and a 30-year-old man, who were not known to each other, got into an argument at the licensed premises on the corner of Tooloona Street and Golden Four Drive around 6.30pm.</p>
      <p>The older man is then accused of pulling out a knife and stabbing the other man multiple times in the chest and abdomen.</p>
      <p>The younger man was treated at the scene before being taken to Gold Coast University Hospital, where he remains in a serious condition.</p>
      <p>Police say the 30-year-old man later surrendered himself to officers and was transported to Gold Coast University Hospital for treatment to his finger.</p>
      <p>He has since been charged with one count of grievous bodily harm and will appear in Southport Magistrates Court on December 3.</p>
