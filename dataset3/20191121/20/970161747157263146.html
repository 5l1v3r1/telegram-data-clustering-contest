      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/is-im-a-celebritys-ian-wright-married-does-he-have-children-and-how-tall-is-he-11187922/">‘s </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> hasn’t had the easiest few days since arriving in the I’m A Celebrity jungle.</p>
      <p>Having roughed it in Snake Rock and faced a terrifying helmet full of scorpions in a Bushtucker Trial, things also got tense <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/im-a-celebrity-2019-line-up-harry-redknapp-accidentally-lets-slip-ian-wright-is-being-paid-1-million-to-enter-jungle-10880371/">between him and comedian Andrew Maxwell over their crocodile foot dinner,</a> in scenes aired on Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>All of which has led to speculation that he could walk from the show before he is eliminated – with Ladbrokes offering odds of just 4-1 on him quitting the series of his own accord.</p>
      <p>The former footballer was one of the first celebs tipped for the jungle this year – and rumour has it he’s also one of the best paid.</p>
      <p>But just how much is he earning for his time on the show?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>

      <p>It’s been reported that Ian Wright <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/how-much-im-a-celebrity-contestants-paid-11170757/">is the second-highest paid star</a> of the 2019 series behind Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>According to the reports the ex-Arsenal and England striker is pocketing £400,000 for his appearance on the show – although that’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/08/im-a-celebrity-2019-line-up-harry-redknapp-accidentally-lets-slip-ian-wright-is-being-paid-1-million-to-enter-jungle-10880371/">a little less than 2018 winner Harry Redknapp claimed he was getting recently.</a></p>
      <p>Last year’s king of the jungle accidentally let the secret of Ian’s appearance on the show slip last month – before the line-up had been confirmed – during an appearance in Nottingham, where he also dropped hints about his salary.</p>
      <p>An audience member promptly tweeted what he had said, saying: ‘Interestingly, he let slip that Ian Wright has been paid £1m to appear on this years #ImACeleb.’</p>
