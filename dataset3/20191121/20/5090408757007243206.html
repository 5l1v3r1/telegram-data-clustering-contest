      <p>The requirements to make the sixth Democratic presidential primary debate in December <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/dnc-raises-threshold-ahead-of-pbs-newshour-politico-december-presidential-debate">are the strictest the Democratic National Committee has set so far</a>, and it could make for the most intimate debate stage yet.</p>
      <p>Candidates must both secure 200,000 individual donors, of which 800 must be from 20 different states or territories, and earn 4% in four DNC-approved national or early-state polls from Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, or Nevada.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, candidates can satisfy the polling requirement by reaching 6% in two early-state polls. Polls released by December 12, the week before the debate, will count towards qualification.</p>
      <p>Ten candidates qualified for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/biggest-moments-from-the-fifth-democratic-debate-in-atlanta-2019-11">the fifth Democratic primary debate</a>, which had less strict qualification thresholds and was co-hosted by the Washington Post and MSNBC in the Atlanta, Georgia, area on Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>The December debate will be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/25/politico-pbs-december-democratic-debate-057271">co-hosted by PBS NewsHour and Politico</a> on Thursday, December 19, at Loyola Marymount University in the first DNC primary debate to be held on the West coast. The moderators, timing, and format of the debate have not yet been announced.</p>
      <p>California moved up its primary date to Super Tuesday, situating the delegate-rich state as a key player in the 2020 primary.</p>
