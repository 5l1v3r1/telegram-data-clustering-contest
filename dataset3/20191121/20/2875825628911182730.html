      <p>She said she had planted false stories on her private <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> account and revealed in an epic statement that she'd blocked every account but Rebekah's from viewing her Stories to test whether or not the information would leak.</p>
      <p>And when they did, she told the world what had happened in a bombshell statement that went viral.</p>
      <p>Rebekah has vehemently denied leaking stories about Coleen and said in her own statement that she was "disgusted" that she even had to deny it, especially when she's heavily pregnant.</p>

      <p>She was so upset that she cut her Dubai holiday short and flew back home.</p>
      <p>Becky claimed she has hired a forensic IT expert to prove her innocence and is considering legal action.</p>
      <p>But representatives for Coleen say she has irrefutable evidence that the leaks came from Rebekah's account.</p>
