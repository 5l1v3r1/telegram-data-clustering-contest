      <p>A British man has been shot dead in the latest incident of violence on the Costa del Sol.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old was shot several times in the chest at around 3.15pm this afternoon at Riviera del Sol, Malaga.</p>
      <p>The area is popular with British expats and holidaymakers and only a short drive from the resort of Fuengirola.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended the scene, but were unable to save the man’s life.</p>
      <p>The suspect was seen speeding away in a ‘high end vehicle’ from the scene.</p>
      <p>No arrests have taken place so far.</p>
      <p>It comes after a man was shot dead on a residential estate known as Andasol on Friday, a short drive from Marbella town centre and close to a beach area called Alvarito Playa east of Marbella.</p>
      <p>Officers hunting the killer, believed to have fled the scene in a getaway car, have not made any official comment on the nationalities of the gunshot victims, although local reports at the time said they were of ‘Arabic origin.’</p>

      <p>That incident is being linked to a gangland drugs feud.</p>
      <p>In January, a millionaire businessman was shot dead outside his luxury Costa del Sol home.</p>
      <p>Marco Yaqout was gunned down in the early hours of January 21 as he drove into his garage in his trademark UK-plated Bentley.</p>
      <p>His killer was waiting for him outside his villa on a quiet residential street in an upmarket neighbourhood in San Pedro de Alcantara near Marbella called Las Petunias.</p>
      <p>The gruesome murder was the latest in a string of violent incidents on the Costa del Sol in recent months.</p>
      <p>They have included two attacks on Brits, the shooting of a Dutchman in a sushi restaurant in the popular resort of Benalmadena and the machine-gun murder of a Frenchman outside his home in Marbella.</p>
