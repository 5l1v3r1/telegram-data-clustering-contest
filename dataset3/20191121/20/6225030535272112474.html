      <p>#8 CATOCA (5-2) was nabbed out of her last by Jeff Mullins. She has been performing well in flat mile dirt races this year. Flavien Prat climbs aboard and she might like 7f. She drilled a bullet for this Nov. 6 and earned quality pace ratings in a $35k/3L one mile dirt race at Santa Anita Oct. 18 (2nd by 1/2 length).</p>
      <p>#9 Incredibly Lucky (8-1) brings good recent form to the table and drew outside the other speed. She is a bit light on numbers and I am not sure about seven panels, but her best number was at Del Mar Aug. 30.</p>
      <p>#3 Claudelle (7-2) exits back-to-back front running romps at Santa Anita. She is 0-for-3 at Del Mar (2 runner-up finishes) and this is her first extended sprint try.</p>
      <p>#4 Dearborn (5-1) returns to dirt and stretches out a furlong and a half. She set the pace and finished 2nd in a local flat mile dirt affair vs. this kind July 20. Drayden Van Dyke hops aboard and he always seems to elevate his game at Del Mar.</p>
      <p>#7 Mongolian Empire (8-1) easily ran down <i>Dearborn </i>in her lone local try at one mile, and that was her best dirt number to date.</p>
