      <h1>Lawyer Found Guilty of Money Laundering for OneCoin’s Cryptoqueen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:11:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Joeri Cant</a></address>
      <p>A Manhattan federal jury has found lawyer Mark S. Scott guilty of helping OneCoin co-founder and current fugitive Ruja Ignatova launder $400 million.</p>
      <p>On Nov. 21, Law360 <a href="https://www.law360.com/fintech/articles/1221988?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=section">reported</a> that the Manhattan jury of six women and six men decided to hand down a guilty verdict to Scott, a former partner at law firm Locke Lord who was suspected of being paid $50 million to launder $400 million for Ignatova, also known as the “cryptoqueen.”</p>
      <h3>Claim of innocence was rejected</h3>
      <p>The jury did not buy Scott's claim that he had no knowledge that OneCoin was a scam and that he was only doing his best as Ignatova's lawyer to represent her interests. They arrived at their guilty verdict in only four hours. </p>
      <p>Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/onecoin-fugitive-cryptoqueen-allegedly-paid-50-m-to-lawyer-to-launder-funds">reported</a> yesterday that OneCoin is considered to be among the crypto industry’s most infamous exit scams. Scott reportedly used a wide network of fake companies, offshore bank accounts and fraudulent investment schemes to launder the ill-gotten funds.</p>
      <p>To date, the Bulgaria-based firm remains operational despite investigators’ allegations that it raised $4.4 billion in a Ponzi scheme.</p>
      <h3>Cryptoqueen’s brother speaks against her</h3>
      <p>In March 2019, Ignatova’s brother and co-founder of crypto scam OneCoin, Konstantin Ignatov, was <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/onecoin-co-founder-pleads-guilty-faces-up-to-90-years-in-jail">arrested</a> at Los Angeles International Airport. He pleaded guilty to the participation in the multi-billion dollar fraud and money laundering. In November Ignatov signed a plea deal and now faces up to 90 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Ignatov, who also testified in the trial against Scott, reportedly provided more details against his sister, saying that she had obtained a passport and tickets to Austria and Greece from her home in Bulgaria. However, to date, the cryptoqueen remains at large.</p>
      <p>Ignatov reportedly also told law enforcement agencies that his sister informed him that she had the support and protection of a "rich and powerful" Russian individual.</p>
