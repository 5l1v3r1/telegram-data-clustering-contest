      <p>Pretax profit at the country’s second-largest health insurance provider, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Laya+Healthcare">Laya Healthcare</a> last year increased by 4 per cent to €20.6 million as revenue increased sharply.</p>
      <p>New accounts filed by Laya Healthcare show the company recorded the increase in profit as revenue went up by 16 per cent from €66.6 million to €77 million.</p>
      <p>The profit allowed the company to pay a dividend of €24 million during the year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=AIG">AIG</a> Europe-owned company posted the higher revenue after it last year announced two price hikes – the insurer put up the price on 63 schemes by 1.7 per cent from November 1st last year, having raised the price on 82 of its plans the previous July.

      <p>Laya Healthcare managing director Dónal Clancy said 2019 looked set to be “another solid-performing year”.</p>
