      <p>The National Economic Council (NEC) has resolved to set up an ad hoc committee to look into the ownership structure of power distribution companies.</p>
      <p>Imo Gov. Emeka Ihedioha disclosed this while briefing State House correspondents after the NEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja.</p>
      <p>He stated that `NEC resolved to constitute an ad hoc committee, including Kaduna Gov. Nasiru el-Rufai, as well as governors representing the six geo-political zones, to review the status of the ownership structure of the power distribution companies.</p>
      <p>El-Rufai was was at some point, Director-General of Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) while the six governors are currently serving on the board of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC).</p>
      <p>“He said that the committee would also include representatives of the National Council of Privitisation (NCP) and BPE.</p>
      <p>The governor said that what gave rise to the discussion on the NDPHC was an issue that came up in terms of ownership between the Federal Government and state governments.</p>
      <p>“ It was important for us to deal with all concerns and establish factually what the true situation is.</p>
      <p>“Whether it is a joint or partnership ownership structure between the Federal Government and the state governments or whether the Federal Government has divested its shares,’’ he said.</p>
      <p>Ihedioha said that the Accountant General of the Federation, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, also briefed the council on the balances of national accounts.</p>
      <p>He said that Excess Crude Account balance as at Nov. 20 stood at 324.d5 million dollars; Stabilisation Account, N29.48 billion; while Natural Resources Development Fund Account stood at N79.7 billion</p>
      <p>Ihedioha said that the vice president, who is the chairman of council, briefed the meeting on the Single Window Steering Committee and the Apapa Traffic Task Team.</p>
      <p>He said that Gov. Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa State would join the team.</p>
      <p>The Imo governor, however, said that nothing was discussed on budget support refund which came up at the council the previous month.</p>
