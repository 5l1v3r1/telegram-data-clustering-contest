      <h1>MLB owners unanimously green-light purchase of Royals by Sherman group</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T20:05:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 20:05</time> by <a rel="author">AP</a></address>
      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas — John Sherman has been approved as the new controlling owner of the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/kansas-city-royals-team">Kansas City Royals</a>, and his group plans to close its deal to purchase the team from David Glass and his family next week.</p>
      <p>Major League Baseball owners voted unanimously Thursday to approve the deal, which was announced Aug. 30 and was expected to be worth about $1 billion. Sherman and his local co-investors will become only the third owners since Ewing Kauffman founded the club ahead of the 1969 season.</p>
      <p>Sherman, 64, has lived in Kansas City for more than four decades, even after he bought a non-controlling interest in the Cleveland <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/cleveland-indians-team">Indians</a>. He founded, built and then sold a series of energy companies.</p>
      <p>“He had a three-year indoctrination with the Indians. The Indians are regarded to be a very well-run and obviously very competitive on the field organization,” baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said. “I think the opportunity to function inside a quality major league organization gives John a unique opportunity to take over in Kansas City, not miss a step.”</p>
      <p>Kansas City went 59-103, its second straight 100-loss season. Ned Yost, who led the Royals to their second World Series title in 2015, retired as manager and was replaced by Mike Matheny.</p>
