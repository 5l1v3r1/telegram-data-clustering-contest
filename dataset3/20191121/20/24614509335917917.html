      <p>Investors were on edge Thursday, given the sudden pickup in volatility on Wednesday. Let’s look at a few top stock trades that were grabbing the headlines today.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 1: Sonos (SONO)</h3>

      <p><b>Sonos </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/sono-stock-quote/"><b><u>SONO</u></b></a>) stock is up marginally after reporting earnings, as shares look to continue higher.</p>
      <p>There’s a solid setup in Sonos, with $15 resistance weighing on the stock. Over $15 — which is also the IPO price  — could send the stock to new 2019 highs.</p>
      <p>From September through November, $15 to $15.25 has been acting as resistance. If bulls can clear this area, it will trigger a breakout. On a pullback, see that the 50-day moving average supports the stock, just as it did on Thursday’s post-earnings reaction.</p>
      <p>Falling below the 50-day moving average puts $13 and the 100-day moving average on watch.</p>
      <h3>No. 2: Ulta Beauty (ULTA)</h3>

      <p>After a hearty bounce in September, <b>Ulta Beauty</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ulta-stock-quote/"><b><u>ULTA</u></b></a>) is back to being under pressure. In fact, the stock is just a few dollars above its 52-week low.</p>
      <p>The setup does not look encouraging for longs, but those who are bullish on Ulta can dip their toe in this one with a stop just below the 52-week low. On a rally, see if Ulta can reclaim the 50-day. Keep in mind, though, that rallies north of $240 have been sold over the last few months.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 3: Aurora Cannabis (ACB)</h3>

      <p>Are cannabis stocks back from the dead? Maybe so, and that’s got <b>Aurora Cannabis </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/acb-stock-quote/"><b><u>ACB</u></b></a>) moving nicely. Not long ago, ACB sold for more than $8 per share; two days ago it was below $2.50.</p>
      <p>To say it has been a volatile ride would be an understatement. It’s exactly why we <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/07/does-aurora-cannabis-stock-chart-point-to-a-mid-summer-plunge/">warned investors to get out</a> of the way in the summer, when shares were significantly higher than current levels.</p>
      <p>Now, ACB stock is trying to reclaim the $3 level — and struggling. The 20-day moving average is acting as resistance. If shares clear this level, see how ACB handles the $3.50 mark. That was vital support before the most recent breakdown.</p>
      <p>No matter how this pans out for Aurora, though, it’s vital for bulls that it doesn’t go on to make new lows.</p>
      <h3>Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow No. 4: L Brands (LB)</h3>

      <p><b>L Brands</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/lb-stock-quote/"><b><u>LB</u></b></a>) is following after a number of its retail peers, with a volatile post-earnings reaction. However, unlike many of its peers, shares are actually rallying after the results, up almost 10%.</p>
      <p>The setup becomes rather straightforward from here.</p>
      <p>Above $15.50 and LB is okay on the long side. Below and it’s a no-touch. Over the 50-day puts $18 on the table and above that, $19.25 is possible. Keep it simple and go from level to level.</p>
      <h3>No. 5: Jack in the Box (JACK)</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Shares of <b>Jack in the Box</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/jack-stock-quote/"><b><u>JACK</u></b></a>) are off slightly after reporting earnings, but man did the stock put in a wide trading range today!</p>
      <p>After opening near its 50-day moving average, shares ran to $90. Then, the stock took a tumble, falling to $80 and is now trying to hold its 200-day moving average. Talk about a series of events.</p>
      <p>In any regard, this one is too volatile for me. Below Thursday’s low and JACK can technically fill the gap (blue box) down to $74.</p>
      <p>If it can move over the 50-day moving average, the Thursday high near $90 is possible. Above that mark and the $93 highs are possible.</p>
