      <p>ARLINGTON, Texas — Rob Manfred sounds prepared to turn a smoking gun on the Astros.</p>
      <p>The baseball commissioner made clear Thursday, during a news conference at the conclusion of the owners’ meetings, that the penalties for illegally, electronically stealing signs from opponents changed immediately and dramatically on Sept. 15, 2017, the day he publicly divulged — in the wake of the Red Sox-Yankees Apple Watch scandal — that all 30 teams had been informed of a new discipline protocol, including lost draft picks, for this offense.</p>
      <p>Just six days later, the Astros appeared to use an illegal, electronic sign-stealing system at Minute Maid Park against the White Sox, whose pitcher Danny Farquhar <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/former-astros-pitcher-mike-fiers-says-team-electronically-stole-signs-in-2017/">voiced the allegations to The Athletic</a>. Jomboy Media then came up with substantiating video evidence.</p>
      <p>“I take myself seriously. I do,” Manfred said. “I think that when this began to bubble up during the ‘17 season, I looked backward at how the issue had been dealt with. …I wrote what I wrote because I did not believe that the disciplines that had been handed out in the past were in line with the significance of the issues that we were dealing with. So I do view (the public statement) as a line of demarcation.”</p>
      <p>Asked in what sense, Manfred said, “In the sense that the clubs were on notice. That however the commissioner’s office has dealt with these issues historically, going forward, I viewed them with a particular level of seriousness.”</p>
      <p>Asked whether he thought his mandate was heeded, Manfred said, “We know in at least one instance it probably wasn’t heeded. We know that now. I think the message was clear.”</p>
      <p>If the Astros are found guilty of the charges in the Sept. 21, 2017 game, then they’ll be subject to an array of penalties, including the loss of draft picks and international bonus pool money, fines and suspensions.</p>
      <p>Manfred said this investigation, which already has begun, would be folded into his investigation of the Astros that began last month in the wake of Brandon Taubman, their since-dismissed assistant general manager, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/24/astros-fire-assistant-gm-brandon-taubman-for-outburst-at-reporters/">harassing a female journalist.</a> That led to the Astros attempting to smear a journalist’s report of that incident. The commissioner said he hoped to complete the entire investigation by the start of spring training.</p>
