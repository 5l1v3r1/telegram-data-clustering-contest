      <p>Accra, Nov. 21, GNA - Tullow Ghana Limited (TGL), Africa’s leading independent Oil and Gas Company, has launched a scholarship scheme for 57 students of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology spanning the period, 2018 and 2019.</p>
      <p>The scholarship initiative is aimed at building the capacities of students in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) sphere.</p>
      <p>Beneficiaries of the scheme are both undergraduate and postgraduate students of the School of Engineering, specifically, the Department of Petroleum Engineering.</p>
      <p>Kweku Awotwi, Managing Director and Executive Vice President of Tullow Ghana, said: “At Tullow, we believe that education is the bedrock of our society and a pre-requisite for Ghana’s development. It is clear, that Ghana’s future economic development and prosperity is closely linked with our students’ success in the STEM fields because it is the main propeller of innovation and industrial development in this technology-driven world.</p>
      <p>This informs Tullow’s focus in supporting in-country training and scholarship support in the STEM fields to produce more technical professionals. Our aim is to leave a lasting legacy and to invest in Ghanaians for the future at all levels.”</p>
      <p>Professor Kwasi Obiri-Danso Vice Chancellor of the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, commended Tullow Ghana for instituting such a brilliant scheme.</p>
      <p>Admonishing students to make the best of it, Professor Obiri-Danso, said, “If anybody gives you education, he’s provided you with life. Any organization that thinks of the welfare of the society and has given back to the welfare of the society, is worth celebrating”.</p>
      <p>The Tullow Ghana STEM Scholarship initiative currently supports three public universities in Ghana in the training of students in STEM. It is projected that 135 students will be supported by the company by the end of the 2020 academic year.</p>
      <p>At the basic level, Tullow Ghana in collaboration with its partners in education has constructed 10 Sustainable Kindergartens in the Western Region and will complete 2 more by 2020.</p>
      <p>The company has rolled out the ‘Innovate to Educate’ program providing after-school sessions targeting pupils and teachers in Basic Schools and SHS.</p>
      <p>Tullow has also provided broader science education support to Senior High Schools to complement Government’s effort by refurbishing science laboratories or providing equipment in eight SHSs across the country.  Ten million dollars has been donated as free SHS support spanning five years.</p>
      <p>Tullow Ghana is a firm believer that for development and growth, the capacity of Ghanaians ought to be built. Tullow Ghana is committed to creating shared-prosperity as well as leaving a legacy of lasting sustainable social and economic benefit in its host countries.</p>
