      <p>Chan, 63, was actually caught red-handed by the police whilst he was delivering a package (whiskey) to his customer in a car at the above-mentioned parking lot. His arrest came after the Suvarnabhumi airport’s tourist police and officials were given a heads up by Songkhla’s immigration officers about a parcel from Hat Yai airport to Suvarnabhumi. In the parcel which was addressed to Chan, the police found several items like the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Empty foreign whiskey bottles </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Screw tops </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Labels with foreign whiskey names</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
