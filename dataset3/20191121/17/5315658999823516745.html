      <h1>Nearly half of Wellingtonians accessing ultra-fast internet</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:32:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://info.scoop.co.nz/Business_Central_-_Wellington" target="_blank">Business Central - Wellington</a></address>
      <p>Wellington's increasing uptake of ultra-fast broadband will help cement our reputation as a creative capital where high-tech start-ups want to be, according to the Wellington Chamber of Commerce.</p>
      <p>"The government's fibre roll-out programme means 44 per cent of Wellington's households and businesses are now accessing the internet at lightning speeds," says Chief Executive John Milford.</p>
      <p>"This is really impressive infrastructure that enables businesses to dramatically improve their productivity and reach markets they could never dream of before.</p>
      <p>"It demonstrates what is possible when the government thinks ahead and partners with private companies to deliver 21st century infrastructure.</p>
      <p>"The government's goal is to deploy fibre-to-the-premises to 87 per cent of the country by 2022, so far they are ahead of schedule having reached 87 per cent of their goal.</p>
      <p>"I encourage all businesses and families to check out their ability to access ultra-fast broadband and see for themselves how everyday tasks like watching a movie or doing their accounts can be made so much easier.</p>
      <p>"The challenge now is for more Wellington businesses to adopt faster broadband and the advantages it brings.</p>
      <p>"Wellington is home to an exciting mix of online companies and start-ups. Having innovative companies so close to their new customers will push further development."</p>
