      <p>Broadway found its Gloved One — and he’s coming fresh from the Temptations.</p>
      <p>Ephraim Sykes, currently kicking up his heels in Broadway’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/03/21/temptations-music-elevates-by-the-numbers-aint-too-proud/">“Ain’t Too Proud — the Life and Times of The Temptations,”</a> will play Michael Jackson in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/10/michael-jackson-musical-should-stay-away-from-broadway/">upcoming musical “MJ,”</a> producer Lia Vollack and The Michael Jackson Estate announced Thursday.</p>
      <p>It’s a solid choice. Sykes, who played the impossibly limber Seaweed on <a href="https://nypost.com/2016/12/08/hairspray-was-the-best-tv-musical-so-far/">“Hairspray Live!,”</a> snagged a Tony nomination for his performance as David Ruffin, the microphone-twirling tenor of the Temps.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been somebody who really loved the spotlight,” Sykes <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/article/2019/ephraim-sykes-aint-too-proud-david-ruffin-broadway-video-interview/">told Gold Derby</a> when he was cast as the cocky Ruffin. With any luck, he’s learned how before he slips on that glove.</p>
      <p>“MJ The Musical” starts previews July 6 at the Neil Simon Theatre, where it opens Aug. 13. Two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Lynne Nottage is writing the book. Given the recent and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/01/25/explosive-michael-jackson-documentary-details-shocking-sex-abuse-claims/">shocking Jackson documentary</a>, it should be quite a challenge.</p>
