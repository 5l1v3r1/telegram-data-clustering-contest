      <p>“We have learnt that Swamy Nithyanand has escaped from the country after a rape case was registered against him in Karnataka,” said Ahmedabad (Rural) Superintendent of Police (SP) R.V. Asari. He said the State police would go through the proper channel to seek his custody in connection with the case filed here. Since he was a key accused in the case, he would be arrested on his return to the country, he said.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, police on Thursday also arrested the Principal of the Delhi Public School near Ahmedabad where Nithyanand set up his ashram. According to police officials, Hitesh Puri violated government norms while leasing out land for the ashram. He was later released on bail.</p>

      <p>Two children aged 9 and 10 years enrolled at the ashram had told the police they were tortured, made to work and kept in illegal confinement at a flat in the city for over ten days. Similar allegations were made by two other children rescued from the ashram in a complaint filed by their parents.</p>
