      <p>TORONTO - Prosecutors say a former pastor convicted in the death of his pregnant wife should spend 13 to 15 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>Crown attorneys are making their sentencing submissions in the case of Philip Grandine, who was found guilty of manslaughter in February in the death of his wife Anna Grandine.</p>
      <p>Anna Grandine was 29 years old and 20 weeks pregnant when she drowned in the bathtub at the couple's home in October 2011.</p>
      <p>Tests later revealed she had lorazepam - also known under the brand name Ativan - in her blood despite not having been prescribed it.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors argued at trial that Philip Grandine secretly sedated his wife with the drug so he could carry on an illicit relationship with a parishioner.</p>
      <p>Defence lawyers argued Anna Grandine took the medication herself because she was depressed about the affair, and either slipped and drowned in the tub or took her own life.</p>
