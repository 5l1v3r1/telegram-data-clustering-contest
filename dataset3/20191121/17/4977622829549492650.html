      <p>India will host the 14th India-Japan Annual Summit and it could happen in Northeastern India in mid-December, <a href="https://www.wionews.com/india-news/14th-edition-of-india-japan-annual-summit-to-be-held-in-northeastern-india-around-mid-december-263581">reports</a> <i>WION News.</i></p>
      <p>The summit is likely to take place in 15 to 17 December Prime Minister Narendra Modi and PM Shinzo Abe who is now the longest serving leader of Japan.</p>
      <p>The location of the summit has strategic undertones and also Japan has been heavily investing in ‘infrastructural development’ in Northeast.</p>
      <p>New Delhi and Tokyo relationship is being defined as a "special strategic and global partnership"</p>
      <p>Japanese investments to the tune of Rs 13,000 crores are already in the pipeline for India's Northeast.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the East Asian country is also involved with several key projects in the region, including Guwahati Water Supply Project, Guwahati Sewage Project in Assam, Northeast Road Network Connectivity Improvement Project, etc.</p>
      <p>The leaders of the two countries have already met each other thrice this year, beginning with Osaka at the time of the G20 summit, followed by the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, and then finally a meeting which took place in Vladivostok during the Eastern Economic Forum which took place there.</p>
