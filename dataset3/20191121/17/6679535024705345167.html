      <h1>Is govt. willing to provide space, funds for e-filing facility in courts, asks HC</h1>

      <p>The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the State government to inform the court if it is ready to provide required space and funds for providing facilities for e-filing of petitions and documents in courts and tribunals across the State.</p>
      <p>Observing that ideally the e-filing facility should be made available in all courts and all categories of litigations, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur made this observation in its order on a PIL petition, which has sought facility of e-filling in the courts. The Bench was hearing the petition filed by Dilraj Rohit Sequeira, an advocate, and two NGOs.</p>
      <p>Pointing out that there is no point in starting e-filing facility without converting existing files and documents of the courts to e-format, the Bench said the process of converting files of pending cases into e-format requires huge manpower for separating sheets of files for scanning, high-speed scanning machines, huge space, and funds.</p>
      <p>Stating that the High Court, at present, has no sufficient space to keep high- speed scanning machines, the Bench said the courtâ€™s new software, which was put to use from October 14, 2019, has a provision for e-filing but the issue is of space and funds.</p>
      <p>It was contended in the petition that e-filing reduces the use of paper and thus saving trees and the environment as courts use large amounts of paper every day.</p>
      <p>Pointing out that though the Supreme Court had announced e-filing system in 2017, the petitioners said it was yet to take off in Karnataka whereas four other High Courts have already started e-filing in phased manner by making e-filing mandatory in certain category of cases.</p>
