      <p>As you head into the new year (and decade!), you can use your newfound 2020 vision to “Look at Her Now” when Selena Gomez releases her third solo album. The yet-untitled project is under the working name of <i>SG2</i>, which raises the question: Did Selena Gomez forget about her early album <i>Stars Dance</i>? Anyway, when the album comes out on January 10, it’ll proceed to be all of our soundtracks for the next 356 days of 2020. It’s Gomez’s first full-length album since 2016’s <i>Revival</i>, following her string of singles like “Bad Liar” and “Wolves” in the latter part of the decade. And among its 13 tracks, it’ll feature Gomez’s <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/selena-gomez-first-billboard-no-1.html">first No. 1</a>, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-lose-you-to-love-me-song-review.html">“Lose You to Love Me,”</a> and <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/selena-gomez-music-video-look-at-her-now-bieber-watch.html">“Look at Her Now,”</a> the surprise song she released a day later.
