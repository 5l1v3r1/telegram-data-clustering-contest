      <h1>Bristol City Council closes waterlogged children’s play area on Horfield Common</h1>
      <h2>"This is something we are very concerned about"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:03:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Shashana Brown</a></address>
      <p>A Bristol play area will be closed for the entire winter because it is waterlogged.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council </a>has made the decision to shut Dorian Road Play Area on<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/horfield"> Horfield</a> Common due to a drainage problem.</p>
      <p>The park will be closed from November 18 until work begins to resolve the pre-existing flooding issues.</p>
      <p>Signs have gone up all around the park notifying users of its closure.</p>
      <p>The notice says: "This play area will be closed from Monday 18th November 2019 for the whole of the winter period while we try and resolve the drainage issues on this site. We apologise for any inconvenience caused."       </p>
      <h3>'We are very concerned'</h3>
      <p>With fencing due to go up next week, the council has removed equipment including swings and seats from the play area.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Friends of Horfield Common (FOHC) said: “This issue has been ongoing since the play area was installed – and this is something that we are very concerned about.</p>
      <p>“The flooring in the play area was never suitable and we raised this at the time the plans for the site were put forward a number of years ago.”</p>
      <p>The group says, despite allocations of funding to fix the issue, it has been withdrawn many times as a result of changes to funding and schemes.</p>

      <p>However, through the newly established area committees which allocate council infrastructure levy (CIL) funding, the money needed is now in place.</p>
      <p>FOHC said: “We have now been advised that this play area will be fixed as soon as possible and that this is a priority.</p>
      <p>“We hope that the issue can be fixed once and for all so that this play area can be used year-round as intended.”</p>
      <p>Bristol Live has asked the council when the work is likely to start and what it will include.</p>
