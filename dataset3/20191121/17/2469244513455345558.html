      <p>Ladies in Tiverton have been helping the Devon Freewheelers fill up their fuel tanks thanks to a generous donation.</p>
      <p>The St Paul’s Lady’s Club, which meets once a month raised £400 throughout the year with raffles and fundraising events. The group also donated £200 to CHAT.</p>
      <p>Mick Scaife, a volunteer with the Devon Freewheelers, said the money would be used to help transport blood and organs across the county.</p>
      <p>He explained: “A slice of this will go straight into a fuel tank because the big thing we go through is fuel, tyres and servicing. Tyres last 6,000 miles, and we get 45 miles to the gallon with fuel. If you’re doing 200 miles on a day, it doesn’t last long. Then you have insurance costs of £1,000 a bike, and we have eight of those now. My personal bike is £78.40 fully comprehensive, but as soon as you say you’re a courier system and dealing with blood, somebody pulls a figure out of the air, and we go from there.</p>
      <p>“All riders are fundraisers, so we’re continually fundraising to keep the wheels turning. If we don’t have funds coming in, nothing is moving.</p>
      <p>“These donations are essential. We are pro-active, we go out and stand in supermarkets, we have done bag filling, and other organisations come on board and help us out are always appreciated. We cannot get enough money in, and the demand on us is increasing every year.”</p>
      <p>Mr Scaife said the workload had doubled in recent years.</p>
      <p>“We’re all volunteers, we all give up our own time to give something back into the system, plus for me, I like to get out and meet and greet people,” he added.</p>
      <p>“Some people may one day reap the benefit. They may not know it, but we may have shifted some of their samples to get it in for early intervention to prevent suffering.”</p>
