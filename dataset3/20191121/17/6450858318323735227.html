Separately, the smart speaker is <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-speaker/dp/B07PJV3JPR?ascsubtag=06-3778327-11-0000000">on sale for £34.99</a> reduced from £49.99, so you still save a significant amount, so will save you a significant amount on the usual retail price. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ring-Video-Doorbell-Charcoal-additional/dp/B07Z8L9TQ1?ascsubtag=06-3778327-11-0000000">Head to Amazon to get this deal now.</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/ring-smart-doorbell-review-uk-2016-3644481/">Ring Video Doorbell</a> is one of our favourite bits of smart home tech. It still ranks among our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-smart-doorbells-3686012/">top smart doorbells</a>, and for many people it's not worth splashing out almost £100 extra on the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/security-cameras/ring-video-doorbell-2-review-3663877/">Ring Doorbell 2</a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon's latest <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/amazon-echo-dot-3-3685148/">Echo Dot</a> is the definitive entry-level smart speaker. With a hugely improved sound and design over its predecessor, it offers all the benefits of Alexa in a compact form factor. </p>
      <p>The beauty of this deal is how easily both devices work together. Amazon's 2018 purchase of Ring means Echo devices can seamlessly manage your doorbell without having to lift a finger. </p>
