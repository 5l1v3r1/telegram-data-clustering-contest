      <p>In a tweet the day before he gave his famous interview about the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, she wrote: "It is so rare to meet people that are able to speak from their hearts with honesty+pure real truth, that remain steadfast and strong to their beliefs.</p>
      <p>"Andrew is a true+real gentleman and is stoically steadfast to not only his duty but also his kindness + goodness @TheDukeOfYork."</p>
      <p>Today she is attending a 'crisis summit' with the Duke, according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7711571/Prince-Andrews-ex-wife-Sarah-Ferguson-arrives-Buckingham-Palace.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>

      <p>Fergie's comments came ahead of the BBC Newsnight special in which journalist Emily Maitlis sat down with Prince Andrew and quizzed him over his friendship with paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Days after the interview, the Duke of York yesterday announced he would be quitting royal duties for the "foreseeable future".</p>
      <p>Less than 24-hours later, he was pictured smiling and waving behind the wheel of his car.</p>

      <p>Andrew, wearing a suit and tie, was snapped leaving his home in Windsor this morning as the fallout from the Royal Family's unprecedented crisis continued.</p>
      <p>The Duke will no longer receive his £249,000 royal allowance which is taxpayers' money from the Sovereign Grant and he has been ditched by a number of companies and charities.</p>
      <p>He has been forced to step back from his more than 200 charity patronages.</p>

      <p>A senior Palace source confirmed to the Mirror that the Duke had vowed to “not return to public life until the Epstein case is closed or he has cleared his name”.</p>
      <p>The palace insider said “that could be a considerable amount of time”.</p>
      <p>Following Saturday night's interview, Andrew was criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's alleged victims and a lack of remorse over his friendship with the pervert, who killed himself in a New York prison while facing child sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has repeatedly denied claims that he had sex with Epstein accuser Virgina Giuffre (formerly Roberts) on three occasions when she was a teen.</p>

      <p>Prince Andrew's statement in full last night said: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. </p>
      <p>"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>
