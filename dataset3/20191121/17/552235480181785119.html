      <h1>Dylan Kerr shares hilarious Rangers story as Kilmarnock hero reveals bevvy session before stopping 10-in-a-row</h1>
      <h2>The defender dealt with Brian Laudrup despite having something of a personal crisis the night before.</h2>

      <p>Former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> defender Dylan Kerr has given the inside track on the day he kept Brian Laudrup quiet and stopped Rangers winning 10-in-a-row - after tanning a bottle of whisky the night before.</p>
      <p>Ally Mitchell's goal famously gave Killie a 1-0 win at Ibrox in the penultimate game of the 1997-98 season, allowing <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> to lift the title the following weekend.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/26-episode-26-sam-nicholson-dylan-kerr/id1462738495?i=1000457440248">Football Daft podcast</a> Kerr was asked if he'd played in that match - and he revealed a surprising detail about his pre-match preparations.</p>
      <p>The former defender said: "Not only did I play, I had probably one of the best and worst games of my life.</p>

      <p>"The best thing is that we won it, I kind of got the better of Mr Laudrup - even though he did give me a torrid time - but on the back of that I was steaming the night before!</p>
      <p>"I'd just found out that my beautiful wife was involved in another relationship. We never got to the stage of wanting children, thank God.</p>
      <p>"I think I polished off nearly three-quarters of a bottle of Balvenie that night!Â </p>
      <p>"We went to that game and we were in that dressing room knowing we were going to win.</p>

      <p>"We knew we were going to win because <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> came out thinking that they'd won it. Everyone was in celebration mode before, because of the occasion: 10-in-a-row, you still talk about it now.</p>
      <p>"When we saw all the Rangers players in the tunnel, laughing and joking, we just thought: 'these guys think they've won it. We're going to give it a go'.</p>
      <p>"Right at the death, Ally Mitchell, it came from his knee, rolled down his shin, and went in the corner."</p>
