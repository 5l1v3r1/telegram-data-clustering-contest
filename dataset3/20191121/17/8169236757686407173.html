        <b>Jose Mourinho had not so long ago been linked with the Arsenal job before this week being announced as the new Tottenham manager.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Portuguese tactician is once again back in the Premier League following his sacking by Manchester United just under a year ago, but he’s ended up at Spurs rather than at their north London rivals.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/21/mourinho-on-managing-tottenham-despite-chelsea-fan-vow/">Video: Mourinho’s hilarious explanation for taking Tottenham job despite previous vow to Chelsea fans</a></h3>
      <p>A report from the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/arsenal-set-their-sights-on-jose-mourinho-95rwpx0r6">Times</a> recently claimed Mourinho had discussed the Arsenal job over dinner with Gunners chief Raul Sanllehi, but it now seems there’s an explanation for him ending up at Tottenham instead.</p>
      <p>According to a fresh report from the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/calling-out-players-and-falling-out-with-physios-where-it-all-went-wrong-for-jose-mourinho-at-manchester-united-2glljtqwv">Times</a>, the structure at Arsenal did not appeal to the former Man Utd and Chelsea boss.</p>
      <p>Not much more detail is given, but it’s easy to imagine that AFC are not particularly well set up at the moment after a difficult few years on and off the pitch.</p>
      <p>The club’s recruitment has been suspect on more than one occasion, with plenty of change also taking place in a short space of time as the likes of Arsene Wenger, Ivan Gazidis and Sven Mislintat are among those to leave in the last 18 months or so.</p>
      <p>Tottenham have certainly seemed more stable and well organised in recent years as they’ve finished above their historically more successful neighbours for the last three seasons in a row.</p>
