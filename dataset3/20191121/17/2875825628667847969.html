      <p>Strictly Come Dancing have scrapped the Lindy Hop-a-thon following last year's scoring chaos.</p>
      <p>It won't be replaced by a similar scored group dance this year, a BBC insider has told Mirror TV.</p>
      <p>This time last year, the celebrities performed the dance-a-thon and were scored in their couples over their efforts.</p>
      <p>Their score was combined with their individual routine to give a total "judges score".</p>
      <p>However the dance won't be making a comeback this weekend, which will come as a relief to Head Judge Shirley Ballas.</p>

      <p>The scoring for the group dance last year turned into a nightmare over a technical glitch when their tablets stopped working after the dance.</p>
      <p>Shirley was then forced to resort to their notes, however began reading the scores out in the wrong order. Fellow judge Bruno Tonioli intervened and they reversed the order, reading from last to first.</p>
      <p>But there was another awkward moment went Shirley read out Charles Venn's name - but said his partner was Dianne Buswell, instead of Karen Hauer.</p>
      <p>Tweeting after the show, Shirley wrote: "Hysterical, computers went down, well that's live TV, amazing show this evening. @DarceyOfficial @BrunoTonioli @CraigRevHorwood great team. Thank you to all who tuned in. X."</p>

      <p>At the time, a BBC spokesperson said: "Once the judges had scored the Lindy-hopathon, the marks were successfully electronically recorded on a tablet and fed to the gallery who received an accurate record of the judges marks.</p>
      <p>"When Head Judge Shirley had to read the marks out live on air, the tablet she was reading from malfunctioned and went blank so she was unable to read out the final order."</p>

      <p>They added: "Bruno therefore read out the results from a back up, which is a paper template and had been filled in by the judges."</p>
      <p>There will also be a change to this year's final, which will feature three finalists instead of four.</p>
      <p>Paralympian Will Bayley was forced to pull out of the competition at the beginning of this month after suffering a nasty injury which could take six months to heal. The BBC have confirmed that they won't be bringing back a former contestant to replace him.</p>
