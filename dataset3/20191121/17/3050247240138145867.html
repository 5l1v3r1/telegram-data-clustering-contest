      <h1>Markets Crash After Reports That Binance's Shanghai Office Closed in Crypto Crackdown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:08:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Aaron Wood</a></address>
      <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly raided and shut down the Shanghai offices of leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance. </p>
      <p>Citing unnamed local sources, The Block <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/daily/47922/binances-shanghai-office-shut-down-following-police-raid-sources-say">says</a> that local police have shut down Binance’s offices after raiding the premises. Between 50–100 of the exchange’s employees reportedly worked out of the Shanghai location.</p>
      <p>Binance has not responded to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment as of press time. </p>
      <h3>Closure follows crackdown </h3>
      <p>The purported raid follows a crackdown on cryptocurrency-related businesses and activities in the country. </p>
      <p>Recently, financial authorities in China <a href="https://img.chainnews.com/material/images/9df230090d984ca4067a47487abfbce6.jpg">issued</a> a notice to the public, directing individuals to report businesses engaged in virtual asset trading to the Shanghai headquarters of the People's Bank of China — the country’s central bank. Activities that must be reported include:</p>
      <blockquote>“Virtual currency transactions in the territory; the other is to issue ‘xx coins’ and ‘xx’ in the form of ‘blockchain application scenarios.’  Currency, fundraising or bitcoin, virtual currency such as Ethereum; third, providing services such as publicity, diversion, agency trading, etc. for registered ICO projects, virtual currency trading platforms, etc.” </blockquote>

      </p>
      <p>However, Binance told Cointelegraph that the company had not received this notice. Similarly, Beijing-founded Huobi told Cointelegraph that the company was familiar with the notice, but had not received it.</p>
      <h3>Offices are an outdated concept?</h3>
      <p>In a move of regulatory arbitrage, Binance <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/major-crypto-exchange-binance-to-open-office-in-malta-after-japanese-regulator-warning">opened</a> offices in Malta in 2018 as the island nation ramped up its cryptocurrency-friendly regulatory projects.</p>
      <p>Last month, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-plans-new-office-in-beijing-in-first-presence-in-china-since-2017">rumors abounded</a> that the exchange was opening offices in the Chinese capital of Beijing, despite the country’s decidedly anti-cryptocurrency stance. </p>
      <p>However, according to the firm’s CEO Changpeng Zhao, offices themselves are an antiquated concept. In a tweet on Nov. 19, Zhao <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1197031061399597056?s=21">said</a>, “Office and HQ are old concepts like SMS and MMS. Time is moving on…” </p>
      <h3>Markets react with major coins seeing red</h3>
      <p>Cryptocurrency markets have reacted to the news, with most major coins seeing significant losses on the day.</p>
