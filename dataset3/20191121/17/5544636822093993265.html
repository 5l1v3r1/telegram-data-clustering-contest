      <p>The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MCBAN) has congratulated Governor Yahaya Bello for emerging victorious in the November 16 governorship election in <a href="http://concisenews.global/politics">Kogi State</a>, Concise News reports.</p>
      <p>The state Secretary of the organisation, Mohammed Suleiman, who gave the commendation in a statement issued in Lokoja on Thursday, described the victory as well-deserved.</p>
      <p>He called on the governor to use his second term to provide meaningful development for the state, urging him to embark on programmes and projects that would impact positively on the lives of the people.</p>
      <p>Suleiman also lauded the Fulani in the state for trooping out in a large number on the election day and for heeding the directive to vote for Bello, saying that their action contributed immensely to the governor’s victory at the polls.</p>
      <p>He also called on all Fulani to remain peaceful and resist any attempt to be used by aggrieved politicians to disrupt the peace of the state.</p>
      <p>Suleiman urged the governor to carry along all the sections in the state in the distribution of amenities and political appointments in the interest of equity and justice.</p>
      <p>He appealed to the people of the state to continue to cooperate and support Bello in his efforts at taking the state to the next level.</p>
      <p>According to him, whoever is not satisfied with the outcome of the election should seek legal redress instead of resorting to violence.</p>
      <h3>PDP senators reject Bayelsa, Kogi results</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the Senate, on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/21/pdp-vows-to-challenge-outcome-of-bayelsa-kogi-governorship-elections/">rejected the Bayelsa and Kogi Governorship election results</a> announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).</p>
      <p>The senators, led by the Minority Leader of the Senate, Sen. Enyinnaya Abaribe, made the rejection at a news conference in Abuja.</p>
      <p>INEC had declared the candidates of the All Progressives Congress (APC), David Lyon and Yahaya Bello winners of the gubernatorial elections.</p>
      <p>“We want to call the attention of Nigerians. We are very disturbed by the elections that were held last weekend in Bayelsa and Kogi.</p>
      <p>“We totally reject the pronouncements after the elections by INEC and we are worried about the trend of what happened during the election.</p>
      <p>“We know that the results that were announced were not a true reflection of what happened in the field.</p>
      <p>“We are much more concerned about the fact that it seems that all the gains made by the PDP in all the period of democracy starting in 1999 seem to have been eroded from the elections starting in Osun, Edo and culminating into last weekend.</p>
      <p>“We are further pained by the fact that the PDP woman leader, Salome Abuh, after declaration of result, hoodlums still chased her to her house and burnt her to dead in the clear view of security agents.”</p>
      <p>The caucus called on President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Inspector-General of Police and other security agencies to immediately fish out the killers of Salome.</p>
      <p>“We hear that the police are launching an investigation but this is something we don’t want to be put under the carpet because it involves life,” Abaribe said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the spokesman of the Senate, Sen. Godiya Akwashiki, in his reaction to the outcome of the Bayelsa and Kogi gubernatorial elections said: “I don’t think it will be right for the Senate to say anything about the election.</p>
      <p>“Nigeria is not a lawless country and we must obey it. The Electoral Act has spelt out everything that there should be primaries between aspirants in political parties so a candidate will emerge.</p>
      <p>“After the primaries, INEC will set aside a day for general election. Based on the Electoral Act, the elections have come and gone. If anyone has any grievances, the one knows what to do,” he said.</p>
