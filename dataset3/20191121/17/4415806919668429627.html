      <p>Twenty-five deer were culled at Dublin’s Phoenix Park on Thursday, the Office of Public Works (OPW) said.</p>
      <p>Fallow deer have no natural predators in Ireland and it is necessary to control numbers, the Government department said.</p>
      <p>Campaigners said officials were trying to make money through the sale of meat and added contraceptives should be used instead.</p>
      <p>The Alliance for Animal Rights said: “People have not the empathy but surely we should be promoting peace and not this slaughter?</p>
      <p>“Most normal people care about animals if they see them suffering – all this is going on with our taxes.”</p>

      <p>The Phoenix Park was established as a Royal Deer Park in 1662.</p>
      <p>The OPW said: “Fallow deer have been in the park ever since and have been sustainably managed over the centuries.</p>
      <p>“The OPW takes deer welfare very seriously.”</p>
      <p>It said if animals were not removed, food would become scarce and more animals would ultimately suffer.</p>
      <p>“Without population control there would be other welfare issues such as low body fat, malnutrition and high incidence of death from exposure to cold in winter.</p>
      <p>“Attempting to maintain too many deer within a restricted park area would soon lead to a build-up of parasites and other pathogens causing disease in the deer.</p>
      <p>“Public safety would also be a serious concern if the population is not maintained at the current numbers.”</p>
      <p>The OPW does not administer contraceptives through feed or injections and there are no contraceptives licensed for use in free-living deer in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Campaigners said there were examples of contraceptives used in the Rocky Mountains in the US which could last for several years.</p>
      <p>The cull was carried out under licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Services, (NPWS) and in conjunction with the School of Biology and Environmental Science, UCD, and overseen by a vet.</p>
      <p>The OPW added: “We regularly monitor the worldwide development of technology to limit deer populations and will continue to keep our policies for the management of deer under review.”</p>
