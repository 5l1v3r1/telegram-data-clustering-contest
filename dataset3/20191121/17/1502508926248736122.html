      <p>Floods and landslides in Karnataka and Kerala have damaged swathes of coffee and spice crops in plantations that supply the bulk of India’s demand.</p>
      <p>The Coffee Board has done preliminary surveys (current year) in the calamity-affected areas in Karnataka and Kerala to estimate the damage to coffee plantations due to floods and landslides.</p>
      <p>According to the preliminary assessment in Karnataka, of the crop-bearing area of 226,244 hectares (one hectare = 110,000 square feet), about 97,365 hectares has suffered a crop loss of more than 33 per cent and 620 hectares is reported to have been affected by landslides and floods.</p>
      <p>In Kerala about 850 he­ctares has been reported to be affected by a crop loss of more than 33 per cent and about 16 hectares of plantations are reported to have been affected by landslides and floods.</p>
      <p>According to the assessment made by the Directorate of Horticulture, Karnataka, 11,502 hectares of black pepper, 3,184 hectares of ginger, 573 hectares of turmeric, and 25,891 hectares of chilli have been severely affected owing to heavy rain this year with an estimated crop loss of more than 33 per cent.</p>
      <p>Around 43 per cent of the crop-bearing areas of Karna­taka is estimated to have been affected with more than 33 per cent crop loss, said Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal. The Coffee Board of Ind­i­a has done preliminary su­r­v­e­ys in the two states to estim­a­t­e the damage due to floods, la­ndslides, premature fruit dr­o­p, and fungal diseases, he said.</p>
