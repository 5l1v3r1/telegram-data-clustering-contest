      <p>The Assembly on Thursday passed a motion for considering the further stages of the Kerala Farmers’ Welfare Fund Bill, 2018, as reported by the Select Committee.</p>
      <p>A ‘watershed’ scheme to provide farmers with an assured income and a share of the revenue generated from selling farm produce lay at the heart of the Bill mooted by Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar.</p>
      <p>The Bill proposed to levy an Actio Apportum (Avakasha Labham) cess on farm produce. The levy will be rooted to farmers as a ‘profit rights’ fund. The Bill applies to a range of products, including dairy, livestock, poultry, rice, fruits and vegetables.</p>
      <p>The Bill proposes to set up a welfare board to guarantee monthly pension and other benefits to farmers.</p>
      <p>Land owning farmers (up to 15 acres), share croppers and tenant farmers can join the welfare fund. The board will levy them a minimum contribution of ₹100 per month. The government will contribute ₹250 monthly for each member farmer.</p>
      <h3>KMTA Bill</h3>
      <p>The Assembly also passed a motion to send the Kerala Metropolitan Transport Authority (KMTA) Bill, 2018 to the Select Committee. The Bill proposes a unified metropolitan transport authority to coordinate transport infrastructure development and planning in urban localities in the State.</p>
      <p>It moots the declaration of Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Kozhikode cities as high-density urban mobility areas to be governed by a Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) having 15 members and a chairperson.</p>
      <p>The MTA will be empowered to find and implement mass rapid transport solutions such as metro rail and improve and develop transport infrastructure for hassle-free and safe travel. Several foreign agencies had conditioned aid and loan packages to Kerala on the formation of such a single controlling transport authority.</p>
