      <h1>Your Polteageist in Pokemon Sword and Shield might be running around in a counterfeit teapot</h1>

      <p>There’s apparently a counterfeit teapot in Pokemon Sword and Shield.</p>
      <p>Pokemon Sword and Shield players who catch Ghost-type Pokemon Sinistea in the game may notice something slightly off when it evolves into Polteageist.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the teapot the Pokemon inhabits can be either a counterfeit antique or an authentic one. The Pokemon evolves into Polteageist when exposed to a Chipped Pot or a Cracked Pot. So, how do you know if the Pokemon is inhabiting a fake or real antique?</p>
      <p>The Chipped Pot features a mark of authenticity while the Cracked Pot doesn’t, <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Sinistea_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">according to Bulbapedia</a>. So how can you tell which is which?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2019/11/21/20975944/pokemon-sword-shield-sinistea-polteageist-cracked-pot-chipped-pot-counterfeit-how-to-tell?__twitter_impression=true">According to Polygon</a>, just go into your Pokedex and press A to see detail. You will need to press A again for “Motion/Cry,” to be able to move your Pokemon around to see the bottom of the teapot.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-swsh/polteageist/">Per Seribi</a>, the standard form you will find in the wild is counterfeit. But there’s nothing to worry about because the stats are the same on a real teapot and a fake one.</p>
      <p>It’s just something fun the developers threw in.</p>
