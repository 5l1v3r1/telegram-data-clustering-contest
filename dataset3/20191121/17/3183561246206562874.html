      <p>When the world first saw the new Toyota Supra, the world wept that there was no Toyota-designed engine under the hood. Rather than some new 3JZ, <a href="https://jalopnik.com/why-the-2020-toyota-supra-has-a-bmw-inline-six-and-why-1834540861">there was a BMW B58 straight six</a>. Well, everyone may dry their tears, as tuning legend Steph Papadakis got that stock Supra engine to the four-figure mark.</p>
      <p>Let me begin by saying that the 2JZ was not the greatest engine ever made. When Toyota raced the Mk4 Supra, even, it <a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-four-cylinder-2020-supra-super-gt-car-sounds-bizarr-1838529170">yanked out the heavy iron-block 2JZ and put in a four-cylinder instead</a>.</p>
      <p>Still, the whole reason for being for the Supra was that you could boost the <a href="https://jalopnik.com/heres-why-the-toyota-supras-2jz-is-such-a-legendary-eng-1794949464">overbuilt Bubble Era engine</a> to the moon and make six or seven hundred horsepower on stock components, double that with support from a healthy aftermarket. If you wanted a dyno queen, you got a Supra. If you wanted a highway racer, you got a Supra.</p>
      <p>That’s been the fundamental crisis of the Mk5 Supra. Without the big-power capability of the 2JZ, wasn’t it just some other GT car? Where was the identity?</p>

      <p>Well, the B58 can make big power, at least with the giant brain of <a href="https://jalopnik.com/how-la-s-underground-street-racing-scene-and-the-fast-a-1825723732">Papadakis</a> behind the build and about 19 or 20 kilos of boost on an engine dyno. He thinks it even sounds like a 2JZ.</p>
