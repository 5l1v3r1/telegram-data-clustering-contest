      <p>A woman has admitted throwing a milkshake over a homeless man as he was being punched and kicked on the ground.</p>
      <p>Dana Hooper said she is afraid to leave the house after video of the incident went viral.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty to common assault after thousands viewed the attack online.</p>
      <p>Hooper was ordered to do unpaid work after a clip of her throwing liquid over the 60-year-old man was shown in court.</p>
      <p>Hooper, 24, threw her milkshake over Nick Hulley as he groaned in pain and tried to defend himself, Brighton Magistrates' Court heard.</p>

      <p>Hooper followed Mr Hulley after an earlier confrontation with him earlier in the evening near a theatre in the city on October 13.</p>
      <p>A clip from the video was played in court as part of the prosecution evidence against Hooper.</p>
      <p>Hooper, from Portslade, pleaded guilty to common assault by throwing her drink over Mr Hulley.</p>
      <p>District Judge Teresa Szagun told Hooper her sentence was increased by the humiliation she subjected him to.</p>
      <p>She said: "I found it was an aggravating feature you were prepared to continue following him - whilst he was being assaulted by others - to add to the humiliation by the action you took."</p>
      <p>Suzanne Soros, prosecuting, said independent witnesses described being concerned for Mr Hulley's safety and trying to intervene.</p>
      <p>"She carried on abusing him even after people were saying to leave him alone," Ms Soros said.</p>

      <p>"They describe kicking while he was on the floor and he was shouting and groaning in pain.</p>
      <p>"I could see him on his back, holding his arm up as if trying to protect himself, one said. "Female</p>
      <p>One told a witness: "I'll stamp on his head in front of you."</p>
      <p>Ms Soros said: "Female Two had a bottle in her hand and started sloshing the liquid on him."</p>
      <p>Mr Hulley has not come forward to make a complaint, the court heard, and there was would be no financial compensation for him.</p>
      <p>Hooper was with a group of friends on the Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>Ed Fish, defending, said there has been a confrontation between Hooper, her friends and Mr Hulley.</p>
      <p>He said: "The man is still making comments and she throws the drink over him."</p>
      <p>The court heard Hooper has been afraid to leave home since the video went viral.</p>
      <p>Mr Fish said: "She receives a tirade of abuse. Mr Fish said his client had lost control. She does apologise and she regrets it."</p>

      <p>The judge told the defendant: "There has been a considerable backlash at the outrage at your behaviour.</p>
      <p>"You having been shamed by social media and judged by them. It may be there wasn't a full picture of the circumstances.</p>
      <p>"You say this was a retaliation for abuse from the victim earlier. "This is not any justification for your behaviour."</p>
      <p>The judge acknowledged Hooper had a difficult and complex background and ordered her to serve a 12 month community order including 12 rehabilitation days and 80 hours unpaid work.</p>
      <p>Hooper will also be under electronic weekend curfew and will have £175 costs and surcharge deducted from her benefits.</p>

        <li>Peter Derbyshire, 37, of Bognor Regis, is charged with assault by beating of Mr Hulley. He is due to appear at Brighton magistrates court at the end of the month.</li>
