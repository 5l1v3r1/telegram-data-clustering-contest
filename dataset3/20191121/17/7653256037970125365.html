      <p>Whether you like khadi jewellery or pineapple on your pizza, you have to give it to this government, they wear smart pants. While the appointment of Pragya ‘Go Godse Go!’ Singh Thakur has set the proverbial billi among the tukde-tukde qabutar, what the government has done is hit the proverbial pair of birds – pigeons again, one could assume – with one stone.</p>
      <p>Like for earlier governments, for this government too, most institutions are quite proverbial – that is, to be used like proverbs to one’s advantage. The Parliamentary Consultative Committee of the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Ministry-of-Defence">Ministry of Defence</a>, which Singh Thakur now finds herself a member of, is a statutory body. And that alone gives it its importance. But what exactly does a parliamentary consultative committee do?</p>
      <p>The ministry of parliamentary affairs – and one knows the quality of its affairs almost every time one turns on the news when Parliament is in session – chalks up a list of MPs from both <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha">Lok Sabha</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajya-Sabha">Rajya Sabha</a> attached to a ministry and arranges that they meet. As the term ‘consultative’ may suggest, they then chat about issues pertaining to the subject at hand, performing more the role of a ‘tank’ than dealing with ‘think’, and discuss, in a manner of speaking, government policies and their implementation.</p>
      <p>On Thursday, the 21-member consultative committee on defence will be headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh. Apart from Pragya-ji, the committee members include:</p>
      <p>*BJP MP from Sasaram, Bihar, Chhedi Paswan.</p>
      <p>* Still detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA) in his home in Srinagar since the Centre suspended Article 370 in Kashmir, former J&amp;K chief minister and National Conference MP Farooq Abdullah.</p>
      <p>* Former Communication and IT Minister in the Manmohan Singh government – best known for his alleged involvement in the ‘2G spectrum scam’ for which he was acquitted in 2017 – and DMK MP Thiru A Raja (the ‘Thiru’ stands for ‘Mr’, confusing people like me from the more familiar ‘A Raja’.</p>
      <p>* BJP MP and businessman from Chikkodi, Karnataka, Annasaheb Shankar Jolle.BJP MP and businessman from Chikkodi, Karnataka, Annasaheb Shankar Jolle.</p>
      <p>* TMC MP from Dum Dum, West Bengal, and parliamentary committee veteran Saugata Roy.</p>
      <p>*Congress Rajya Sabha MP and former J&amp;K chief minister as well as former parliamentary affairs minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.</p>
      <p>* Nationalist Congress Party chief, former Maharashtra chief minister, Union defence minister and agriculture minister, Rajya Sabha MP Sharad Pawar, who has been busy with other consultations and meetings involving politics rather than statecraft.</p>
      <p>You get the picture. In this mix, Pragya Singh Thakur’s name has been thrown in.</p>
      <p>Now, she is a toxic representative of the people – underlining the toxicity of the people who voted her in without undermining their mandate. She was castigated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly when she proclaimed <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Nathuram-Godse">Nathuram Godse</a> to be a patriotic Indian. She remains an accused in the Malegaon blasts case.</p>
      <p>But her real claim to fame – and golden ticket from ‘fringe’ to ‘mainstream’ – was her defeating ‘hyper-secular’ former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh in the Lok Sabha elections.</p>
      <p>So, while Singh Thakur’s ‘elevation’ to the consultative committee on defence seems to give out all the wrong signals about the kind of politician this government values, the truth is probably a mix of this government parking her in an attic, while making her inclusion certainly look, smell and feel like a promotion -- thereby raising the cheer of her supporters, and the gnashing of teeth of her detractors. In the bigger political canvas, this amounts to bringing delight to her supporters from witnessing her detractors gnashing their teeth -- 'polarisation', for the wordy-wise.</p>
      <p>But Singh Thakur’s inclusion in the parliamentary commentary is not the real scandal. It simply underlines the importance our governments over time have given to the ritual of MPs meeting to discuss matters of national import – especially this government, especially to issues like defence that, frankly, are decided elsewhere, by others -- as every third prime ministerial address to the nation on television, and the ‘quite awe’ with which the national security advisor is covered in the media, can only confirm.</p>
      <p>So, making <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Pragya-Singh-Thakur">Pragya Singh Thakur</a> a member of the Parliamentary Consultative Committee of the Ministry of Defence is not a shocker. It's not as if it's Delhi's Gymkhana Club.</p>
