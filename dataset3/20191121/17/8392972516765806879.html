      <p>Presenter Kate Garraway left her husband Derek Draper to look after their two kids when she jetted off to take part in this year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity">I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> host, 52, has already had to contend with swarms of cockroaches and other nasties crawling all over her - including <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celeb-kate-garraway-reveals-vagina-nickname/">up her "noo noo"</a> - but it appears her husband has faced struggles of his own.</p>
      <p>Derek Draper, who shares daughter Darcey, 13, and son William, 10, with <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway">Kate</a>, took to social media to pose a cookery question to his followers as he had "never cooked a proper meal" in his life.</p>

      <p>On Twitter, he posted a photo of some ingredients for a roast dinner, including pre-mashed potato from Waitrose, some pre-roasted chicken and Bisto gravy.</p>
      <aside>Dad's doing his best.</aside>
      <p>He wrote alongside the pic: "Mum @kategarraway is in the jungle. Dad has never cooked a proper meal in his life.</p>
      <p>"Daughter demands her usual Sunday roast, 'Mum would do it if she were here'.</p>
      <p>"So Dad's doing his best, though you might spot a few cheats. Any suggestions for shortcuts for stuffing? #ImACeleb."</p>

      <p>His followers offered their advice, with some telling him to try Aunt Bessie's ready-made stuffing and others telling him he'd better just take the kids to a carvery.</p>
      <p>One suggested, "Aunt Bessie's ready-made and frozen. Bung it in the oven... take it out" and another wrote, "Carvery in a pub, Derek. Quick, easy and no dishes lol".</p>
      <p>A third tweeted: "Well done you, I'm sure Darcey will love it. Enjoy. Go Kate, look forward to watching x."</p>

      <p>Derek might be doing his best but it could be hard for fans of I'm A Celeb to feel sorry for him, given what the campmates are having to eat.</p>
      <p>Last night's (20.11.19) episode featured the first eating trial of the series, with DJs Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebritys-adele-roberts-gags-as-she-eats-pig-uterus-in-tonights-eating-trial/">forced to chow down on some truly gruesome fare</a> - including a bull's penis, pig's uterus and camel's anus.</p>
      <p>Not all viewers impressed by the challenge, with some on Twitter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/viewers-brand-the-im-a-celebrity-eating-trial-boring-and-say-its-the-same-every-year/">branding the segment "dull"</a> and others complaining it was "the same every year".</p>
