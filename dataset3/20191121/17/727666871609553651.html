      <p>Princess Nokia is one dope rapper, but people are talking about her for another reason today.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop Rumors)</b> Princess Nokia is a New York rapper that I am not fully familiar with, to be honest. That's not a statement about her, but more of a statement about me. Either way, she has gotten my attention and the attention of a lot of rap fans. Her new song "Balenciaga" has people talking quite a bit. It has nearly surpassed half a million views organically and for good reason. Not only is the song solid - SPOILER - she strips totally naked by the end of the video. I am not mad at her! "Don't do this sh#t to be famous...I do this sh#t because I love it," she has said in the past! And I think we do to!</p>
      <p>Remember when Erykah Badu did something similar? </p>
      <p>I ain't mad at any of it! Art is art! </p>
