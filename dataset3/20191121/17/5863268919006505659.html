      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Thursday said that Prime Minister Imran Khan firmly believes in supremacy of constitution, rule of law and across the board accountability.</p>
      <p>The special assistant took to the twitter and said that the entire nation is witness to the fact as to who was declared  Sadiq &amp; Ameen  by the country s top court and who was declared dishonest. </p>

      <p>Dr Firdous strongly rejected the opposition parties stance on the foreign funding case against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). She said we condemn their sordid plot of trying to make Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) hostage and influence its decision. </p>
