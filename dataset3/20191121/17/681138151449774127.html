        <b>A former soldier who sexually assaulted two schoolgirls has been jailed for ten years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shane Townson was described by one of his victims, who has suffered flashbacks and nightmares since the assaults, as a "twisted, vile monster".</p>
      <p>After the offences came to light in 2017 Shane Townson said he had "felt sick with himself" after the assaults and described himself as being a "monster inside",</p>
      <p>He also said he had been constantly hungry for sex and had tried to control his urges by banging his head and scraping his face against a wall.</p>
      <p>Townson, 58, formerly of Colchester, but now of Vicarage Gate, Saint Erth, Cornwall, admitted four offences of indecently assaulting a girl under 16 dating back to the 1990s after he left the Army.</p>
      <p>He also appeared before a court martial sitting at Ipswich Crown Court for six offences of indecent assault dating back to 1983 while he was serving in the Army.</p>
      <p>Sentencing him Judge Emma Peters, who was sitting as a Circuit Judge and a Judge Advocate, accused him of being "manipulative" and said he had assaulted the victims in the "most appalling way."</p>
      <p>She ordered Townson to sign the sex offenders' register for the rest of his life.</p>
      <p>The court heard Townson, who was a Lance Corporal in 1 Squadron, Royal Corps of Transport, had sexually assaulted one of the girls while they were playing "hide and seek".</p>
      <p>Lynne Shirley, for Townson, said he acknowledged the offences were serious and that he was facing a significant period of imprisonment.</p>
      <p>She said he had made admissions to the offences and hadn't put the victims through the added trauma of giving evidence during a trial.</p>
      <p>Miss Shirley said her client was a different person to the one who had committed the offences several decades ago.</p>
      <p>She said he had made six suicide attempts and had been receiving treatment for depression.</p>
      <p>She said Townson had joined the Army in 1978 and left in 1993.</p>
      <p>"His conduct was exemplary," said Miss Shirley.</p>
      <p>She said Townson served in the Gulf War in 1991 and in Kurdistan and believed he was suffering from post traumatic stress disorder.</p>
