      <h1>Naseem Shah bursts into tears after receiving Pakistan Test debut cap</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:39:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:39</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/dunyanews</a></address>
      <p>LAHORE (Dunya News) – 16-year-old pace sensation, Naseem Shah, has made his Test debut for Pakistan against Australia at Gabba, and took an emotional ride after receiving his Test cap.</p>
      <p>The prominent pacer earned his place after his fiery bowling in the practice match against Australia A team where he claimed his first wicket after getting Marcus Harris out.</p>
      <p>As strong as his performance speaks, cricket fans were left astounded after looking at his commitment towards his game, as he bowled exceptionally after he lost his mother back in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Two days after the death of his mother, Naseem delivered a bruising display of fast bowling at Perth Stadium that culminated in the teenager dismissing Marcus Harris (20) with a fearsome bouncer that caught the left-hander’s edge.</p>
      <p>Naseem Shah was named in Pakistan’s Test squad for their series against Australia in October 19.</p>
