      <p>Halberton Village Hall has been awarded Hallmark Three; the highest achievable under the nationally recognised scheme.</p>
      <p>The facility was awarded the certificate under The Hallmark quality standard scheme for village halls following on it achieving Hallmark one and two awards over the last 18 months. The hall is now one of only a handful in Devon to achieve level three.</p>
      <p>Robert Stevens, the secretary of trustees, said: “It is a great honour to receive this award and it reflects the hard work the trustees have put into improving the management of the hall and the improved facilities it provides for our local community.</p>
      <p>“Trustees have found the Hallmark scheme invaluable in helping them improve its practices, and we are encouraging all halls in Devon to participate. We want to thank Devon Communities Together and the Hallmark assessors for their advice and support during this process.”</p>
      <p>Devon County Councillor for Tiverton East, which includes Halberton, Colin Slade, added: “I’m pleased that Halberton Village Hall has won this accolade. It’s taken them a while as you have to go through level one and two. They have achieved level three, which is the best you can do.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations to everyone here, especially Barry, the chair and Rob, the secretary. I know they have worked hard and I’m delighted to be able to present the certificate, and I’m sure everyone in Halberton is going to be equally pleased, and of course, continue to enjoy the facilities here at the village hall.”</p>
