      <h2>Ben Foden opened up on his relationship with his ex wife Una Foden, who he says always encouraged him to embark on a music career</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:08:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X-Factor: Celebrity</a> star Ben Foden has made the surprising revelation that his ex wife, Una Healy from The Saturdays, has been supporting him on the show.</p>
      <p>Ben, 34, is currently competing in the show as part of rugby play boy band Try Star alongside Thom Evans, 34, and Levi Davis, 21.</p>
      <p>The couple split in 2018 after six years of marriage following rumours Ben was unfaithful to her.</p>
      <p>They share children Aoife, seven, and Tadhg, four.</p>
      <p>Ben added that his current wife Jackie Belanoff Smith, who he married after just two weeks of dating, is also cheering him on.</p>
      <p>However - her favourite member of Try Star is not her hubbie... It's Thom Evans.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.html">MailOnline</a> he is working on his relationship with Una for the sake of their children.</p>

      <p>"Una and I have a good relationship for the sake of the kids", he said.</p>
      <p>"I always wish her the very very best. And the kids are loving The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> .</p>
      <p>"They went to the show last week. They’re coming this weekend. They’re going to go absolutely bananas.</p>
      <p>"Their mum is obviously mega talented at singing. She always says when she catches [the show]. Sometimes she’s busy, but she thinks [Try Star] are doing great."</p>
      <p>In fact, he revealed, she had always encouraged him to try out a music career.</p>

      <p>"I told her that I was doing [The X Factor] she thought it was a great idea. She loves it", he added.</p>
      <p>His new wife Jackie is his "number one fan", although she won't be watching if he does make it to the final next week.</p>
      <p>"Jackie has been here the whole time. She’s my number one fan.</p>
      <p>|She’s had Try Star T-shirts made up. And she's told me that Thom’s her favourite in the band!|, he laughed.</p>
      <p>"She’s loving it. The problem is - it’s Thanksgiving next week [in America] so if we make the final she will have to disappear home, which will be a bummer."</p>

      <p>He explained that dating an American meant she did not have any preconceptions of him from the press.</p>
      <p>"She doesn’t know me as Ben the rugby player, or Ben in the public eye", he said.</p>
      <p>"In New York I was no-one. So she’s come into this crazy world."</p>
      <p>Ben also talked about the similarities between performing on the X-factor and playing rugby.</p>
      <p>"It’s surreal", he said.</p>

      <p>"It’s also quite similar [to rugby]. We prepare all week. In rugby, you prep for an 80 minute [game] a week, but it’s still like being on a stage.</p>
      <p>"When you’re [playing] at home you’re a hero. The opposition is the villain. It’s still like a stage show.</p>
      <p>'"Obviously, it's condensed into a two-minute appearance on X Factor. So if you make mistakes they’re a lot bigger, for everyone to see.</p>
      <p>"But it’s still the same mentality. We go into the weekend to put on a show."</p>
