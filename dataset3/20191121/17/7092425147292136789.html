          <b>X Factor: Celebrity star Thom Evans has responded to reports that he's dating judge Nicole Scherzinger. </b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>The rugby player, who is competing in the competition as part of trio Try Star, was first linked to the judge earlier this week after reports suggested that romance had blossomed following some flirty text message exchanges.</p>
      <p>Now, Thom has commented on the speculation, stating that dating <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/celebs/x-factor-celebrity-judge-nicole-scherzinger-secretly-dating-contestant-343417"><i>Nicole</i></a> had crossed his mind, but his schedule is getting in the way.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7711007/Who-wouldnt-want-date-Nicole-X-Factor-Celebritys-Thom-Evans-quizzed-Scherzinger.html"><i>MailOnline</i></a>, he said: "She's stunning. And has romance crossed my mind? Yes. But we don't have much time."</p>

      <p>Thom said "To be honest, we are focusing on the bromance and getting to the final! We are working on choreography, vocal lessons, and it's all so full-on. So there's not a lot of time for much else. "</p>
      <p>Reports last week suggested the rugby player was smitten with Nicole.</p>
      <p>An insider previously told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10390843/x-factor-celebritys-thom-evans-nicole-scherzinger-stunning-amazing/"><i>The Sun on Sunday</i></a>: "Thom is completely Nicole's type. And for his part, Thom was smitten early on - he's always said Nicole is one of the most beautiful women in the world."</p>

      <p>The source claimed Thom fancied Nicole long before meeting her on the show. He was initially a bit nervous about starting something up, and ruining his chances on the series, however, they had great chemistry from the start.</p>
      <p>They added: "And after weeks of texting, Thom finally plucked up the courage to ask her out, and took her for dinner."</p>
      <p>Nicole has yet to comment on the rumours.</p>
