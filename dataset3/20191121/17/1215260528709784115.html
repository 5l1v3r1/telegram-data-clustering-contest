        <b>The attorney for the last remaining accused in the so-called beheading case has dismissed the main prosecution's witness as a liar.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lloyd McFarlane, who is representing Kemar Riley, also pointed out to the seven-member jury that prosecutors presented no scientific evidence to show that his client was present when a woman and her daughter were killed inside their St Catherine home in 2011.</p>
      <p>“There was just nothing. No fingerprint, no blood sample. Nothing,” said McFarlane.</p>
      <p>He was making his closing argument to jurors after closing the case for the defendant.</p>
      <p>Riley was one of five men charged with murder in connection with the death of Charmaine Cover-Rattray, 40, and her 18-year-old daughter Joeith Lynch in Lauriston, St Catherine, on July 20, 2011.</p>
      <p>Both women were chopped, shot and beheaded.</p>
      <p>McFarlane described the killings as “horrendous” and “grisly”, but had a caution for the jury of four men and three women.</p>
      <p>“You can’t make that obscure you from looking at whether the prosecution has proved their case,” he warned.</p>
      <p>The prosecution main witness gave evidence that Riley admitted, during a conversation inside the lock-up area at the Spanish Town Police Station, to shooting Lynch because “she did a bawl out too loud.”</p>
      <p>But noting that the witness was not present when the women were killed, the attorney made it clear that his account was not credible.</p>
      <p>“We are saying he is lying,” said McFarlane. “When you analyse the evidence of Mr [witness' name withheld] you will agree that he is lying,” the attorney told jurors.</p>
      <p>Lead prosecutor Paul Llewellyn is to respond later today.</p>
