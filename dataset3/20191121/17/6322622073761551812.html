      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): IGB Bhd's net profit fell 2.69% to RM66.46 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019, from RM68.29 million a year ago, due to lower contribution from the property investment for commercial property division and hotel division.</p>
      <p>Earnings per share fell to 9.77 sen from 10.3 sen previously, IGB said in a stock exchange filing today.</p>
      <p>Revenue for the period climbed 3.15% to RM364.36 million from RM353.22 million a year earlier.</p>
      <p>The group's retail property investment division saw IGB REIT, the owner of Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens mall, record higher gross revenue and net property income during the quarter.</p>
      <p>It reported gross revenue of RM136.3 million versus RM133.7 million a year ago, while net property income was RM100.7 million, higher than RM96.6 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the property investment in the commercial building division recorded over 80% in average rental rates, which is comparable to the previous year's figure.</p>
      <p>The group's property development division, however, recorded lower revenue of RM30.8 million, down by 52% from RM64 million as its only development project currently under construction, Stonor, a 400- unit condominium located in the vicinity of KLCC, is nearing completion.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the hotel division’s revenue decreased by 10% to RM70.6 million from RM78.6 million last year, on lower average occupancy rates and lower average room rates by a majority of the hotels in the group.</p>
      <p>IGB said that for the first nine months, the group saw a 3.57% increase in net profit to RM148.76 million from RM143.64 million. Revenue rose 7.89% to RM1.02 billion from RM940.91 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>IGB’s share price closed unchanged at RM2.70 today, bringing the group a market capitalisation of RM1.84 billion.</p>
