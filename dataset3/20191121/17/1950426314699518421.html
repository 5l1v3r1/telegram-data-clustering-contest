      <h1>Moscow Slams ‘Aggressive’ US Threats to Hit Egypt With Sanctions Over Purchase of Russian Jets</h1>
      <h2>FM claims Washington forces countries to buy its weapons</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:43:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911211077368835-moscow-slams-aggressive-us-threats-to-hit-egypt-with-sanctions-over-purchase-of-russias-su-35/" target="_blank">Sputnik</a></address>

        <b>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper sent a letter to Egypt’s defense minister threatening with sanctions if Cairo did not cancel purchasing more than 20 Su-35 Flanker-E next-generation fighters from Moscow, The Wall Street Journal reported last week.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Moscow has denounced the US threats to slap Egypt with sanctions for buying Russian Su-35s as “aggression”.</p>
      <p>According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Washington forces the countries to buy its weapons by threatening them.</p>
      <p>“We paid attention to the direct threats of US officials to impose sanctions against Egypt for considering the possibility of acquiring Russian Su-35 fighters. This is very aggressive behaviour”, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters at a briefing.</p>
      <p>The statement comes after Washington reportedly threatened Egypt’s President Abdel Fatah el-Sisi that it could impose sanctions if he goes ahead with the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201911161077321148-us-unlikely-to-offer-egypt-advanced-aircraft-instead-of-russian-su-35---ex-cia-officer/">Su-35 Flanker-E next-generation fighter deal with Moscow</a>. Under Sisi, Russia has become a major source of weapons for Egypt.</p>

        <i>ABC News attempted to pass off footage from a 2017 gun range show as evidence of Turkey bombing Kurdish civilians <a href="https://banned.video/watch?id=5da51412511ff90014a5ffb4">in order to blame President Trump.</a></i>
      </p>
      <p>In spring, the Russian Kommersant newspaper reported that Russia and Egypt had signed a contract for the delivery of Su-35 fighters to Cairo. According to the newspaper’s sources, the relevant agreement, which includes the shipment of over 20 aircraft and weapons worth some $2 billion, came into force at the end of 2018. The first shipments could be made as early as 2020 or 2021.</p>
      <p>A similar situation is underway in Turkey, which has tense relations with the US due to potentially purchasing Russian jets. Turkey is reportedly considering buying Russian Su-35 fighter jets despite the possible impact of such a purchase on relations with the United States. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in early September attended the MAKS-2019 air show outside Moscow together with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
      <p>Erdogan expressed interest in Su-35 and Su-57 fighters, and the topic also emerged during his conversation with the Russian head of state. Erdogan has reportedly said that Turkey and Russia have discussed Su-35 deliveries.</p>
      <p>The United States has repeatedly objected to its NATO ally purchasing <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201910301077178718-turkey-rejects-reports-country-close-to-reaching-su-35-deal-with-russia-amid-s-400-row-with-us/">Russian-made defense systems</a>, saying that, for example, the S-400 is incompatible with the alliance’s security standards and might compromise the operation of F-35 jets.</p>
