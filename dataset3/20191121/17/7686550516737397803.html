      <p>The Conservative Party had £5.6m donated to it in the first week of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>That's by far the biggest amount donated to all the political parties and 26 times more than Labour received in the same period.</p>
      <p>In the same period before the General Election in 2017, £7m was given to political parties. This time, donations total £6,507,146.</p>
      <p>Registered political parties must submit four weekly reports setting out the donations and loans over £7,500 that they have received.</p>
      <p>The first figures released this election campaign show who got what:</p>
      <p><b>Conservative and Unionist Party</b> : £5,673,646</p>
      <p><b>Lib Dems</b> : £275,000</p>
      <p><b>Brexit Party</b> : £250,000</p>
      <p><b>Labour Party</b> : £218,500</p>
      <p><b>Alliance Party of Northern Ireland</b> : £60,000</p>
      <p><b>Green Party</b> : £30,000</p>
      <p>The Electoral Commission website lists where the donations have come from. The biggest single donation is £1m to the Conservative Party from John Gore, there are then a series of companies giving £500,000.</p>

      <p>Producer Mr Gore made a fortune from musicals such as Hamilton, Wicked, Chicago and School of Rock. He admitted he spent a decade away from the UK and didn't vote in the EU referendum. The only Brexit Party donation over the £7,500 threshold is from an individual, Jeremy Hosking, who has given £250,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Hosking has given previous large donations to the party. He made his money through investment and private equity, including as a co-founder and investment portfolio manager for private investment fund Marathon Asset Management. Unite the Union has given Labour £62,000 and a second payment of £21,000.</p>
      <p>The Conservative Party has faced criticism for its election tactics already. During the first leader's debate, between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson, the Tory press office rebranded its <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/general-election-twitter-fact-check-17284315">Twitter account as "factcheck UK".</a> Twitter accused the party of misleading the public and said it would take “decisive corrective action” if a similar stunt was attempted again.</p>
      <p>Then, on the day Labour's manifesto was released, the Conservatives created a bogus website called labourmanifesto.co.uk <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/general-election-labour-manifesto-conservative-17293310">which was attacking Jeremy Corbyn.</a></p>
      <p>The website appeared at the top of some people's Google search results as a paid advertisement.</p>
      <p>An investigation this week revealed the Conservative Party has received large donations from nine Russian donors.</p>
      <p>A secret intelligence report, published by <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/russian-tory-donors-named-in-secret-report-z98nqpkx0?wgu=270525_54264_15743524316604_20f8a7ca63&amp;wgexpiry=1582128431&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">The Sunday Times</a> , said some of the Russian donors are personally close to the prime minister. Alexander Temerko, who has worked for the Kremlin’s defence ministry gave more than £1.2m to the Conservatives over the past seven years.</p>
      <p>The largest Russian Tory donor is Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Vladimir Chernukhin, a former ally of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin.</p>
      <p>She paid £160,000 in return for a tennis match with Johnson and has donated more than £450,000 in the last year alone.</p>
      <p>The details are part of a report which Downing Street has said cannot be published until it has been able to redact relevant matters.</p>
      <p>Labour's Emily Thornberry has said the delay to publishing the report was "utterly unjustifiable, unprecedented and clearly politically motivated".</p>
