      <p><i>Hmm.</i> It's almost like video games themselves are conspiring to make us feel our age recently. Earlier this week <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_smash_bros"><b>Super Smash Bros.</b></a> <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/anniversary_super_smash_bros_for_nintendo_64_is_now_20_years_old_in_europe">turned 20 in the PAL region</a>, and today we posted about <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/pokemon_gold_and_silver">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a></b> <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/11/anniversary_its_been_20_years_since_we_first_glimpsed_johto_in_pokemon_gold_and_silver">reaching the same milestone</a>. Well, what with November historically being <i>lousy</i> with video games releases and Mother Time refusing to stop rolling on and on, we just can't get away from these anniversaries.</p>
      <p>As devout DK fans (or, indeed, those of you that read the headlines before clicking on articles) will know, Rare's Super Nintendo platformer <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Donkey Kong Country</a></b> today celebrates 25 years on this planet. It may have turned up as the 16-bit era was winding down and new-fangled polygons were starting to catch gamers' eyes, but its innovative use of sprites created from 3D models looked <i>mind-blowing</i> on a SNES back in the day, and kept many Nintendo fans happy as the nascent field of 3D gaming stumbled into existence on home console hardware.</p>
      <p>Rare was on the cusp of a remarkable period that would see the UK developer produce some of the finest and best-selling games on Nintendo platforms. Visually, Donkey Kong County might not have aged as gracefully as some platformers of the era, but it was a landmark release and would go on to shape the big ape's appearance and adventures for many years to come.</p>

      <p>We'd tell you to fire up your Switch and give it a play for old times' sake, but DKC isn't yet available with the <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/09/guide_the_20_snes_games_on_nintendo_switch_online_ranked_by_us">other Super NES games</a> via your Switch Online subscription. Donkey Kong Country <i>does</i> feature on <a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/09/hardware_review_the_snes_classic_mini_is_the_perfect_link_to_the_past">the SNES Classic Mini</a>, though, and there are multiple other ways to play it if you're feeling nostalgic. Failing that, you could always play <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a></b> and appreciate how far DK has come in two-and-a-half decades of platforming. Go on, <i>go bananas.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>Is that the end of the video gaming anniversaries for the day, then? Not on your life - consoles get released in November too, you know! If we didn't stick to 'significant' five-year increments, the site would be filled with nothing but celebration posts marking the passage of time and our inexorable journey away from childhood and into the unknown abyss...</i>
