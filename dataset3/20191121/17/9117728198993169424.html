        <b>Williams are hoping to continue developing young talent George Russell in 2020 as the Brit will continue to race for the team next season. Russell has impressed as much as is possible at a very uncompetitive Williams team, comfortably outperforming teammate Robert Kubica despite the Pole having more points.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russell is yet to score a point in F1, but his talent is obvious, having stormed to the F2 title in 2018.</p>

      <p>Williams' senior race engineer Dave Robson says that the team will continue to work with the 21-year old as he develops his skills for what could be a long and fruitful career in F1.</p>
      <p>According to motorsportweek.com, Robson said: <i>“We’ve definitely spent time, and used the opportunity with George particularly to make sure he learns the tracks – not just the left and right! – but that he understands the subtleties of how you have to set an F1 car up for a particular circuit, [for both] qualifying and the race.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Undoubtedly we spend a lot of time now doing that with him and trying to open his eyes, he’s got a phenomenal understanding of how the car works, and what he wants from the car.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Now he’s got to marry that up with the complexity of the set-up, and when we visit the same tracks next year he’ll be in a much better place to help us, to guide us, and that key bit in F1 of how the set-up interacts with the tyres, which as always is the crucial bit, which perhaps for him and anyone coming up from the lower formulas is a bit different."</i>
