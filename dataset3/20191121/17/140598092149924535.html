      <p>All-in-one sausages, bacon and onion gravy. The prunes add a lip-smacking richness, but leave them out if you prefer. Use vegetarian sausages and leave out the bacon for a veggie version.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time: </b>10 minutes | <b>Cooking time:</b> 1 hour<b> </b></p>
      <h3>SERVES </h3>
      <p>eight (if it’s the only dish) or 16 (with other dishes)</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>16 sausages</li>
        <li>16 rashers of streaky bacon</li>
        <li>6 small apples (the “kid size” sold by some supermarkets are perfect)</li>
        <li>8 onions, sliced into 1cm-thick rounds</li>
        <li>250g ready-to-eat prunes, halved (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>100ml chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>2 tbsp grain mustard</li>
        <li>8 large or 16 medium hot dog buns, warmed</li>
      </ul>
      <p>METHOD </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C fan/Gas 6</li>
        <li>Wrap each sausage tightly in a rasher of bacon.</li>
        <li>Slice the apples through their equators in ½ cm to 1cm slices. No need to peel or core; the delicate flower-shaped pattern from the core is pretty and perfectly edible. I discard the top and bottom slices, which have a bit too much skin for cooking (for discard, read: eat myself).</li>
        <li>In two large baking trays, mix the apples, onion slices and prunes (if you are using them) along with the olive oil – it’s not much, but plenty of fat will come off the sausages. Arrange the sausages on top.</li>
        <li>Bake for 50 minutes, turning the sausages once or twice during cooking. When the sausages are well browned, remove them and keep them warm. Carefully spoon off any excess fat from the onions and apples. Return to the oven for another 10 minutes if they need to brown a bit more.</li>
        <li>Add a spoonful of the stock to each pan, and stir well, to release any gunk. Use the rest of the stock if you need it – but the onion mix should be thick and spoonable. Stir in the mustard, taste and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve the sausages in warmed buns, with the onion and apple mix spooned over.</li>
      </ol>
