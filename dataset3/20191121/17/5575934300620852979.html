      <p>The crewneck shirt, available in the ASOS men’s section, is described on the website as being an “oversized T-shirt with half sleeves in transparent fabric,” and that it’s ideal “for those see-through vibes.”</p>
      <p>In terms of caring for the garment, the website says the shirt is “wipe clean only.”</p>

      <h3>Confused online shoppers have taken to social media to poke fun at the see-through garment</h3>
      <p>“I’m glad ASOS wanted me to know about their sale but Aldi have plastic bags for way cheaper,” <a href="https://twitter.com/landsleaving/status/1178770038599409665">wrote one Twitter user</a>, sharing an advertisement for the clear shirt.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Maffooication/status/1181304613166878721">Another Twitter user</a> shared a photo of the clear shirt, writing: “Why is there a man wearing a bin liner for a T-shirt?”</p>
      <p>“@ASOS have put a collar on a plastic bag, I can’t think of any occasion I would wear this,” one user wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Jediwilt/status/1186348305795764224">tweet</a>.</p>
      <p>Monty Geer, who starred in MTV’s “Awkward,” compared the shirt to a shopping bag, writing in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MontyGeer/status/1195049157007773696">tweet</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B42y4wPBPPx/">Instagram post</a>: “Great news, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/asos/">@asos</a> is now selling plastic bags as clothing. So if you’re like me, and you hate buying bags at the grocery store AND wearing clothes than this terrible shirt idea can help.”</p>
      <p>Geer then shared another tweet about the shirt, alluding to the <a href="https://www.insider.com/plastic-straw-ban-why-are-there-so-many-2018-7">environmental effects of disposable plastic</a>, writing: “Turtles are going to look sooo trendy choking on these.”</p>

      <p>In light of environmental concerns, ASOS appears to be taking a step toward promoting sustainability. <a href="https://twitter.com/ASOS/status/1196839335385083905">The brand shared on Twitter on Tuesday</a> that it’s planning to cut out “anything unnecessary” and reduce plastic in its packaging.</p>

      <h3>ASOS appears to sell similar <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/mens-fashion">men’s shirts</a> in transparent, plastic-like fabrics</h3>
      <p>The plastic shirt that’s sparking confusion online isn’t the only one available in the ASOS men’s section.</p>
      <p>There’s another T-shirt with a similar silhouette that has a <a href="https://www.asos.com/us/asos-design/asos-design-oversized-t-shirt-in-clear-transparent-fabric/prd/12551075?clr=white&amp;amp;colourWayId=16426719&amp;amp;SearchQuery=transparent%20shirt">white transparent fabric</a>, offering only slightly more coverage than the original plastic shirt.</p>
      <p>The brand also sells a transparent <a href="https://www.asos.com/us/asos-design/asos-design-festival-oversized-t-shirt-in-transparent-fabric-in-black/prd/11574417?clr=black&amp;amp;colourWayId=16376303&amp;amp;SearchQuery=transparent%20shirt">T-shirt</a> and <a href="https://www.asos.com/us/asos-design/asos-design-festival-relaxed-sleeveless-t-shirt-with-dropped-armhole-in-transparent-fabric-in-black/prd/11914827?clr=black&amp;amp;colourWayId=16376305&amp;amp;SearchQuery=transparent%20shirt">tank</a> in black, which is tinted minimally darker than the white and clear shirts.</p>
