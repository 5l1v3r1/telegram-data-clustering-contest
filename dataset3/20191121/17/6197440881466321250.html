Usually selling for $80, today’s offer is good for a 38% discount, matches the Amazon all-time low, and is the best we’ve tracked since March. As of now, Amazon has yet to announce what shape its <a href="https://9to5toys.com/2019/11/18/best-black-friday-deals-amazon/">Black Friday discounts</a> will take for most of the Kindle lineup. Centered around a familiar e-ink display, Kindle can go weeks on a single charge and sports a no-glare screen for easily reading outdoors. This model comes with Amazon’s Special offers, which showcase new releases, bestsellers, and more.
