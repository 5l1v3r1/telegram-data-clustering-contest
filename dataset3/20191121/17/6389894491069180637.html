      <h1>Six Premier League title races to offer Manchester City hope in their bid to overturn nine-point deficit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:42:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Searles</a></address>
      <p>It may only be the 13th round of the Premier League season, but Manchester City’s clash with Chelsea on Saturday evening has almost become a must-win game following the champions’ defeat to title rivals Liverpool last time.</p>
      <p>The Reds’ 3-1 win at Anfield a fortnight ago extended their lead over fourth-placed City to nine points, while closest challenger Chelsea and Leicester are eight points off the top on 26 points apiece.</p>

      <p>It is rare that such a deficit is overturned and City’s crown already feels as though it is beginning to slip, but it is not unprecedented in the Premier League era.</p>
      <h3>1992-93</h3>
      <p>Tipped for relegation, Norwich City were surprise leaders heading into December in the Premier League’s inaugural season.</p>
      <p>They beat Wimbledon 2-1 to extend go eight points clear before a winless run of six games over Christmas and New Year saw them pegged back.</p>
      <p>The Canaries would finish third, two points behind Aston Villa and 12 behind Manchester United.</p>

      <h3>1995-96</h3>
      <p>The most memorable of collapses, thanks in large part to Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan’s fate-tempting “I would love it if we beat them – love it” post-match rant.</p>
      <p>Keegan’s men had stormed into a 12-point lead in January with 15 games to go and still held an eight-point advantage over United at the end of February.</p>
      <p>But a run of five defeats in eight games until April led to one of the biggest chokes in top-flight history, as United won 13 of their final 15 games.</p>
      <p>Even still, Newcastle were in contention on the final day but ultimately lost by four points.</p>

      <h3>1997-98</h3>
      <p>In Arsene Wenger’s first full season in English football, Arsenal trailed Sir Alex Ferguson’s side by 11 points with nine games to go.</p>
      <p>The Gunners had three games in hand, however, won them all and beat United 1-0 at Old Trafford. It proved to be the difference as they pipped the champions by a single point.</p>

      <h3>2002-03</h3>
      <p>This time it was Arsenal who blew a lead and once again it was United hunting them down.</p>
      <p>The Gunners were eight points clear in March but United went on an 18-game unbeaten run and Arsenal’s penultimate matchday defeat to Leeds sent the trophy back to Manchester.</p>
      <p>It wouldn’t take Arsenal long to pick themselves up, though, as they went on their famed 49-game unbeaten run soon after.</p>

      <h3>2011-12</h3>
      <p>This title race is remembered for going down to the final seconds of the season as a last-minute Sergio Aguero winner against Queens Park Rangers sealed City’s first top-flight crown in 44 years.</p>
      <p>But the contest had seemed all but over with eight games to go when United opened up an eight-point gap.</p>
      <p>Defeats against relegation-threatened Wigan and away to City saw United waste the chance to claim a fifth title in six seasons.</p>

      <h3>2013-14</h3>
      <p>The most recent significant comeback was also produced by City as they chased down Liverpool’s nine-point advantage.</p>
      <p>Reds captain Steven Gerrard infamously led to a costly defeat to Chelsea before they capitulated in their penultimate game against Crystal Palace, surrendering a 3-0 lead with 11 minutes to go – and handing City a second title in three years.</p>

      <p>Comebacks of the magnitude City now require are rare, then, although they are possible – particularly, it seems, when a side from Manchester is involved.</p>
      <p>Defeat this weekend against Chelsea, however, would likely leave them 12 points adrift of Liverpool, a deficit that has only been overturned once before.</p>
