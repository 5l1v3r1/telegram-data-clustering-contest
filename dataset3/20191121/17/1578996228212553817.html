      <h1>Inyoung You Is Charged In Her Boyfriend's Death by Suicide. Will Their Texts Exonerate Her?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:59:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:59</time> by <a rel="author">Rose Minutaglio</a></address>
      <p>Boston College biology major Alexander Urtula was all set to graduate the morning of May 20. His parents were in town from New Jersey to watch him walk the stage and receive a diploma. But just 90 minutes before the ceremony started, they received devastating news: their 22-year-old son had leapt to his death from the top floor of a parking garage.</p>
      <p>Urtula's 21-year-old girlfriend of a year and a half, fellow BC student Inyoung You, was indicted on charges of involuntary manslaughter last month by a Suffolk County grand jury. Prosecutors believe she coerced Urtula to kill himself, alleging in a <a href="https://www.suffolkdistrictattorney.com/press-releases/items/2019/10/28/former-bc-student-indicted-for-boyfriends-suicide">press release</a> that she sent hundreds of texts urging him to "go die." The digital domestic abuse, they claim, became "more powerful and more demeaning" in the hours before his death by suicide.</p>
      <p>You's family released a series of texts between You and Urtula on Tuesday from the final moments of his life. In the purported exchange, she sent over 1o0 messages attempting to talk him out of killing himself. The thread, provided to the <i><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/19/texts-reveal-tragic-last-moments-before-boston-college-student-jumped-off-garage-his-death/0TBuI8GhmpRKIOnJfpFmdN/story.html">Boston Globe</a></i> by a powerful Massachusetts public relations firm hired by You's family, can be read in full, <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/19/transcript-text-messages-between-inyoung-you-and-alex-urtula/0z9izqMqHR4xX5XGT0rplM/story.html?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link">here</a>.</p>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “Where the [expletive] are you.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Who’d you run into or talk to? Whose room did u go to? Hello.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “I’m not talking to anyone. I won’t ever again. I’m happy I got to spend my last night with you. I love you inyoung until my last breath.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “Then WHERE ARE YOU."I ASKED U WHY UR LOCATION WASN’T AVAILABLE ARE U KIDDING ME.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “I’m not gonna be anywhere inyoung this is goodbye forever. I love you. This isn’t your fault it’s mine.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “What What UR LEAVING ME.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “I’m far away on a tall place and I’m not gonna be here for long. I’m leaving everyone.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “ALEX WHAT SRE YOU [expletive] DOING. IF U [expletive] LOVE ME STOP. IF U EVER [expletive] LOVED ME STOP.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “I did love you just not well enough. Good bye.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “STOP."</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “You’ll have everything once I’m gone."</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “PLWASE STOp. Talk to me. STOP. STOP. PLESEE. IM CRYING PLEASE. PICK UP. PLEASE . . . DON’T LEAVE ME LIKE THAT. IF U EVER LOVED ME STOP. IF YOU WANNA SHOW ME U LOVE ME STOP . . . please pick up . . . talk to me please.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “I’m far away on a tall place and I’m not gonna be here for long. I’m leaving everyone.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>YOU</b>: “ALEX WHAT SRE YOU [expletive] DOING. IF U [expletive] LOVE ME STOP.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote><b>URTULA</b>: “You’ll have everything once I’m gone."</blockquote>
      <p>You's case will reportedly rest, in part, on the newly released messages. But will introducing them be enough to exonerate her? Bennett Gershman, a former Manhattan prosecutor and PACE school of law professor, told ELLE.com they "don't really show anything."</p>
      <p>"If half the texts are [abusive] and the other half are from You urging Urtula to seek help, then they kind-of cancel each other out," he said. "It might create reasonable doubt by showing that she wanted to help him get control of himself, but it's impossible to tell without seeing them in full."</p>
      <p>One of Urtula's closest friends previously told ELLE.com that Urtula and You had "relationship issues," but had no idea how bad it really was until after the <a href="https://www.suffolkdistrictattorney.com/press-releases/items/2019/10/28/former-bc-student-indicted-for-boyfriends-suicide">Suffolk County DA</a> accused You of inundating Urtula with "manipulative attempts and threats of self-harm" via text to isolate him from friends and family.</p>
      <p>The purpose behind publicizing the exchange, Gershman said, is to create sympathy for You. Her representatives, Gershman said, likely want to portray their client as a caring girlfriend—and not the hardened criminal the prosecution is painting her as to the public.</p>
      <p>You withdrew from BC in August and is now living in South Korea. According to the <i>Globe</i>, she will return to the U.S. "soon" to be arraigned, though a date has not yet been announced.</p>
      <p>The district attorney's office declined to comment on the newly released texts, telling the <i><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2019/11/19/texts-reveal-tragic-last-moments-before-boston-college-student-jumped-off-garage-his-death/0TBuI8GhmpRKIOnJfpFmdN/story.html">Globe</a></i>: “This office will not comment further on the investigation at this point, or on the evidence that supported our charging decision. More facts and evidence will be made available at the arraignment and throughout the course of the litigation. Until that point, we have no further comment.”</p>
