      <h1>What's new on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu in December 2019</h1>
      <h2>Netflix brings the funny, The Expanse is back on Amazon, and Hulu ventures further Into the Dark.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:18:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/author/Phil%20Nickinson" target="_blank">Phil Nickinson</a></address>
      <p><i>Source: Netflix</i> Tiffany Haddish in Black Mitzvah on Netflix, premiering Dec. 3, 2019.</p>
      <p>December isn't all about the holidays. OK, it's a <i>lot</i> about the holidays, and we're talking the traditional fare that usually requires someone in a red suit with a beard. But it's also about so much more than that. Like Tiffany Haddish taking on her Jewish roots in <i>Black Mitzvah</i> on Netflix.</p>
      <p>And it's about the long-awaited fourth season of <i>The Expanse</i> on or the return of <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i> on Amazon Prime Video.</p>
      <p>Or it's about Hulu going even further down the dark side with another installment of <i>Into the Dark</i>.</p>
      <p>The point is, there's something for everyone as we close out 2019.</p>

      <p>You're going to spend a good bit of December laughing. That's nothing new for Netflix, but it's also especially true as we close out 2019.</p>
      <p>First up? Tiffany Haddish brings her new special — <i>Black Mitzvah</i> — on Dec. 3. And just 24 hours later we'll get Season 2 of <i>Magic For Human</i> with Justin Willman. Plus there's Season 5 of <i>Fuller House</i>, <i>A Family Reunion Christmas</i>, new stand-up from <i>Michelle Wolf</i>, and so much more.</p>
      <p>Holidays fare? Sure. But it's the humor that's going to keep the fire lit this December.</p>

      <p>Everything you could possibly want</p>
      <p>What's that? You somehow don't have a Netflix account? Let's take care of that, shall we? Because it's got more content than you have hours in your life. Think about that for a minute.</p>

      <p>December's tentpoles for Amazon Prime Video couldn't be more diametrically opposed.</p>
      <p>On one hand, there's the third season of <i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>. Eclectic family in the mid-20th Century, dynamics of marriage — and she's still funny as funny can be.</p>
      <p>On the other hand there's Season 4 of <i>The Expanse</i>, which was resurrected by Amazon after SYFY killed it off, much to the dismay of the rabidly loyal fan base. And this season — hundreds of years in the future from where you and I sit, by the way — we're going to find all our favorite characters in places they've never been before.</p>
      <p>And that's just scratching the surface.</p>

      <p>New <i>Into the Dark</i> and the Season 3 premiere of <i>Marvel's Runaways</i> brighten up December for Hulu.</p>
      <p>The gist on the former?</p>
      <blockquote>A mid-level employee at a large company finds out he's not getting the Christmas bonus or promotion he was expecting. But then his boss invites him over for dinner with a proposal for how he can climb the corporate ladder... by beating his professional rival in a violent competition.</blockquote>
      <p>And the gist on the latter?</p>
      <blockquote>The Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase, Gert and Karolina. The kids go head to head with an unstoppable enemy who has targeted Leslie — or more accurately, the child she's carrying.</blockquote>
      <p>Plus so much more.</p>

Why is the November 2019 Update so small, and how does it differ from previous Windows 10 feature updates? You have questions, and we have the answers. Version 1909 is a new type of Windows 10 feature update for Microsoft, as all its features are actually already built-in to the previous version of Windows 10, but are off until you install version 1909.</a>
