      <h2>"It’s almost unrecognisable inside"</h2>

      <p>A historic community pub in Bristol is set to reopen following a major transformation.</p>
      <p>The Portcullis in Staple Hill, which dates back more than 250 years, had fallen on hard times and was being managed on a temporary basis over the last year.</p>
      <p>But it has recently been given a new lease of life in the form of a £185,000 investment from community pub operator Hawthorne Leisure, and will reopen next week with an experienced operator at the helm.</p>
      <p>Debra Tipper is a popular figure in the local pub scene, with 20 years’ experience managing pubs in and around Bristol, including The Swan in Winterbourne and the Cross Keys in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hanham">Hanham</a>.</p>

      <p>The boozer, which is known in the community for its live music, has been completely redecorated inside and out, with new signage, lighting, furniture and brand new toilet facilities, while the original front door has been re-instated in a nod to the pub’s long history.</p>
      <p>It also features a fully refurbished skittle alley and will offer a comprehensive range of cask ales, beers, ciders and spirits, according to a spokesperson, and show live sports and horse racing via Sky Sports, BT Sport, Racing UK and At the Races.</p>

      <p>Debra said: "I can’t wait to see what the locals think of the new and improved Portcullis. It’s almost unrecognisable inside, but we’ve also made sure to retain some of the original features, including the front door.</p>
      <p>"We’re looking forward to welcoming new and old customers to the official reopening - there will be a buffet, and we’ll be staying true to the pub’s tradition for live music with some great musicians as well."</p>
      <h3>'This is a classic, community pub' </h3>
      <p>Hawthorn Leisure operates more than 650 community pubs across England, Scotland and Wales.</p>
      <p>The company’s managing director of operations, Mark McGinty, said The Portcullis is exactly the kind of pub they want to see thriving.</p>
      <p>He said: "This is a classic, community pub with a loyal regular clientele which has been a huge part of the community in Staple Hill for centuries.</p>
      <p>"We were more than happy to invest in The Portcullis to make sure it can continue to be an important community hub, and with Debra’s experience, we’re sure the pub will be a huge hit with the locals."</p>
