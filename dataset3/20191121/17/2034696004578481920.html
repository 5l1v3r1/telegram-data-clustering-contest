      <p>J.J. Abrams has discussed <a href="http://nme.com/tag/star/wars">Star Wars</a> creator George Lucas’ criticism of <i>The Force Awakens</i>.</p>
      <p>Upon the film’s release back in 2015, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/nme-341-1199225">Lucas likened Star Wars’ new owners Disney to “white slavers”</a>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Ahead of the release of <i>The Rise Of Skywalker</i>, the last film in the trilogy that <i>The Force Awakens</i> kicked off four years ago, Abrams has revealed his admiration for Lucas, and says he thinks the comments were misrepresented.</p>
      <p>Talking to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/star-wars-jj-abrams-secrets-of-skywalker-912362/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, Abrams said he “only [has] gratitude for George.”</p>
      <p>Going on to discuss the sale of Star Wars to Disney, Abrams said: “It’s probably a complicated thing for him. To decide you’re going to sell this thing that you created, that was your baby, to anyone – that must be more complicated than signing a check and smiling about it. But he’s been incredibly gracious. He’s been super-generous.”</p>

      <p>Abrams goes on to say that he and Lucas “talked through a ton of different ideas and stories” when working on <i>The Force Awakens</i>.</p>
      <p>“Do I wish that [<i>The</i> <i>Force Awakens</i>] had been his favourite movie of all time? Yes, I only wanted to do well by him,” the director continued. “I would just say that I have nothing but profound respect for the guy and am still truly, even more so now, working on these movies in awe of what he created.”</p>
      <p>Shortly after Lucas criticised the film in 2015, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/george-lucas-apologises-for-calling-disney-white-s-869952">he apologised for the comments</a>, calling the “white slavers” comment a “very inappropriate analogy,” and adding that Disney are doing “an incredible job.”</p>
      <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger recently claimed that the <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/star-wars-films-to-go-into-hiatus-after-the-rise-of-skywalker-says-disney-ceo-2565890">Star Wars films are set to “go into hiatus” after The Rise Of Skywalker</a>.</p>
