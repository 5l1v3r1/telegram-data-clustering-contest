      <h4>Kimberly Brook gave fans an update about her health following her November 17 miscarriage, telling them that she’s ‘healing’ physically after the tragedy that almost took her life.</h4>
      <p><b>Kimberly Brook</b> is physically on the mend after suffering a life-threatening <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/18/james-van-der-beek-cries-wife-miscarriage-sixth-child/">miscarriage</a>, she told her followers on Instagram. The former business consultant, 37, who is married to actor <b>James Van Der Beek</b>, said in her November 20 Instagram story; “Thank you so much for all the love. I’m so grateful for it. A lot of you have asked how I’m feeling physically. I’m healing. I am definitely healing. My biggest thing is my blood pressure. I just get very light-headed very easily so I can’t really get up and walk around for more than a couple minutes right now. A lot of blood transfusion action this weekend, so I’m just taking it super easy trying to restore and build my blood.”</p>
      <p>James announced in a tear-filled message on the November 18 episode of <i>Dancing With The Stars</i>, that his wife of nine years experienced a tragic miscarriage the day prior. She was still in the hospital recovering, but she urged him to still compete on DWTS, James said. Kimberly later revealed on Instagram that <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/19/james-van-der-beek-wife-miscarriage-son-sixth-child-hospital/">she nearly died</a> from the miscarriage, but didn’t go into detail. Dr. <b>Felice Gersh</b>, a top OB-GYN, explained to <b>HollywoodLife</b> in an <a href="https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/11/20/kimberly-brook-almost-died-miscarriage-risks-interview/">EXCLUSIVE interview</a> that near-fatal miscarriages sometimes occur when “pregnancy tissue is retained during the miscarriage,” causing a severe infection. The infection could lead to sepsis or septic shock, a life-threatening emergency.</p>
      <p>A friend of the Van Der Beek family told <b>HollywoodLife</b> EXCLUSIVELY that, “Kimberly is still pretty much on bed rest at home, but she’s healing and on the mend physically. Emotionally, the road to healing will be longer; the trauma will take time to recover from. But overall, they are grateful that Kimberly came out alive. They are all so thankful for that.” A rep for James Van Der Beek declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Kimberly reiterated this in her November 20 Instagram story. “Emotionally, I have a lot of love around me,” she said, while sitting down with one of her daughters. “I just want to say to my friends, thank you for the outpouring. I have over 200 voice messages and over 200 messages to read through as well, and I’m trying to not just pore through my phone right now. So, if I haven’t gotten back to you, I probably haven’t even seen your message or heard it. But, I’m just grateful for all of them and all of the love. Thank you.”</p>
