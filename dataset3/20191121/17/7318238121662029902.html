      <h1>Belgrade orders probe into 'Russia-Serbia cash handover' video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:29:52+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:29</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>Belgrade has launched a probe after a video emerged purporting to show a Russian diplomat or intelligence officer handover a wad of cash to a Serbian man.</p>
      <p>Serbia's president, Aleksandar Vucic, ordered the investigation after the footage was published to YouTube on November 17.</p>
      <p>Serbia's intelligence agency believes the video is authentic and plan to release further information following a national security council meeting on Thursday (November 21), according to Tanjug, the state news agency.</p>
      <p>News of the probe prompted Moscow to play down concerns of weakening diplomatic relations with Belgrade.</p>

      <p>The footage, which is the only upload to an account named Kdjuey Lskduf, purports to show two men meeting before having a drink at a Black Sheep Brewpub (Crna Ovca) in Serbia.</p>
      <p>One of the men, who is said to be a Russian diplomat or intelligence officer, is seen handing over a carrier bag to the second man, whose face is blurred in the video but is said to be Serbian, according to the uploader of the footage.</p>
      <p>The second man later gets into a vehicle, where he is seen rummaging through the bag and pulls out a wad of cash.</p>
      <p>Online critics claim the video is fake.</p>
      <p>Euronews is working to verify the authenticity of the video. Frames from it have not appeared elsewhere online.</p>
      <p>Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic told Blic that such an incident would be "serious matter and problem" if it were proven to be true.</p>
      <p>Serbian relations with Moscow are known to be generally quite close, with the former relying on the latter for oil and gas, and for sharing technology for its armed forces.</p>
      <p>Last month Serbia signed a trade deal with the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union despite being a candidate for EU membership.</p>
      <p>The recent blocking of EU accession talks opening with Albania and North Macedonia could turn Balkan heads towards Moscow.</p>
