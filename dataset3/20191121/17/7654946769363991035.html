      <p>The weapon used in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/14/police-responding-to-report-of-school-shooting-in-california/">deadly Saugus High School shooting</a> in Southern California was a “ghost gun” constructed from various parts to make it difficult to trace, authorities said Thursday.</p>
      <p>Detectives are investigating who assembled the unregistered 45.-caliber handgun that the alleged shooter, 16-year-old Nathaniel Berhow, fired at classmates Nov. 14 on the campus in Santa Clarita, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-11-21/santa-clarita-shooting-45-caliber-gun-saugus-high-attack-a-ghost-gun-sheriff-says">the Los Angeles Times reported</a>.</p>
      <p>The rampage claimed the lives of 16-year-old <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-shooting-gracie-anne-muehlberger-identified-as-a-victim/">Gracie Muehlberger</a> and 14-year-old <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/dominic-blackwell-identified-as-saugus-high-school-shooting-victim/">Dominic Blackwell</a> before Berhow turned the gun on himself and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/santa-clarita-shooter-nathaniel-berhow-dead-from-self-inflicted-wound/">died a day later</a>, officials said.</p>
      <p>Investigators are looking at Berhow’s electronic communications in an effort to find out more about who built the gun, which was a 1911-model pistol, the newspaper reported.</p>
      <p>Berhow’s late father was a gun owner and authorities seized guns, many of which were unregistered, from the teen’s home, the report said.</p>
