      <p>The New England Patriots had a “mystery” wide receiver at practice on Wednesday afternoon. He was wearing No. 10.</p>
      <p>No, it was not Antonio Brown.</p>
      <p>The Patriots are in need of some depth at the wide receivers position, as New England is dealing with injuries, <a href="https://thespun.com/nfl/afc-east/new-england-patriots/injury-update-for-patriots-wr-phillip-dorsett">including one to standout Phillip Dorsett</a>. So, the team brought in some help this week.</p>

      <p>That wide receiver has since been identified.</p>
      <p>New England’s new wide receiver is Quincy Adeboyejo. The 24-year-old wide receiver has reportedly been added to the Patriots’ practice squad. He was an undrafted rookie out of Ole Miss in 2017, signing with Baltimore.</p>

      <p>It’s possible Adeboyejo could be elevated from the practice squad to the active roster. New England’s dealing with several banged up wide receivers. Dorsett, Mohamed Sanu and Julian Edelman have all been limited this week.</p>
      <p>The Patriots and the Cowboys are set to kick off at 4:25 p.m. E.T. on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The game will be on FOX.</p>
