      <h1>Andy Cohen is thrilled by Adam Schiff comparison, calls him a 'patriot' after Stephen Colbert jab</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:38:44+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author">Tyler McCarthy</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Andy Cohen</a> says he is thrilled to be compared to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/adam-schiff">Rep. Adam Schiff</a>, whom he described as “a patriot.”</p>
      <p>The “<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/reality">Watch What Happens Live</a>” host made his comments after learning that he was name-dropped by <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/late-night">“Late Show</a>” host, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/stephen-colbert">Stephen Colbert</a>, in a lengthy monologue earlier this week titled “Don and the Giant Impeach,” about the ongoing public impeachment hearings against President Trump.</p>
      <p>Schiff, as chair of the Intelligence Committee, is one of the lead investigators in the impeachment inquiry.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Specifically, Colbert highlighted the moment in which Schiff read tweets from Trump attacking former Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, in real time during the hearings.</p>
      <p>“Wow, he’s reading Trump’s nasty comment right to her on live TV. It’s like he’s the Andy Cohen of Congress,” <a href="https://youtu.be/o_BOd3-SUhQ">Colbert said</a> before launching into a lighthearted impression of Cohen.</p>

      <p>“No, you’re kidding!” Cohen exclaimed when made aware of the clip by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/andy-cohen-flattered-by-comparison-to-adam-schiff-185612683.html">Yahoo Lifestyle</a>. “I love it!”</p>

      <p>“It’s great. Adam Schiff is a patriot, and so am I,” he continued. “I’m flattered to be in the same sentence as Adam Schiff. And Stephen Colbert.”</p>
      <p>It seems the Bravo host isn’t offended by Colbert’s impression one bit. In fact, the conversation got him to talk about how he handles criticism and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/travel/andy-cohen-slammed-for-flying-with-newborn-son">negative press attention</a>, especially in the wake of recent backlash he caught over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3ztT4jBCjS/">a photo with his infant son</a>.</p>

      <p>“I posted a picture of me with Ben on a boat in front of the Statue of Liberty and I was holding him up and everyone’s like, ‘He doesn’t have a life jacket on!’ And I was like, ‘Oh that’s funny,’” he said. “People will always pick something to criticize you on, and so I know myself, and I know the reality of every situation, and so I just ignore it. It’s stupid.”</p>
