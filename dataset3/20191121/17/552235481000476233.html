      <h1>Rutherglen mum on hellish relationship with Casanova psychopaths - and how she wrote a book to help others</h1>
      <h2>Lucy hopes her book will help victims and survivors of abusive relationships</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:17:27+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:17</time> by <a rel="author">Niki Tennant</a></address>
      <p>Lucy Hawky had two young children, was approaching 30 and working in the charity sector when she was swept off her feet by a man who seemingly had it all.</p>
      <p>On the face of it, he was a successful, financially secure professional, a go-getter with a flash car and his own flat.</p>
      <p>Smitten, Lucy invested her emotional and professional trust in him, carving out a new career as a couple in business together.</p>
      <p>However, it soon emerged that he was seven years older than he’d led her to believe.</p>
      <p>She put the deceit down to a white lie, a silly but inoffensive attempt to impress a younger, attractive, confident woman.</p>
      <p>It then transpired, she claims, that the flat she believed to be his own was rented from a social landlord who housed people with mental health issues.</p>
      <p>The verbal abuse commenced shortly afterwards.</p>
      <p>Lucy claims the man told her no-one liked her, no-one loved her and she was stupid.</p>
      <p>She says he complained her cooking wasn’t up to scratch, candles weren’t lit and she hadn’t put enough effort into her appearance when he came home.</p>
      <p>She now knows, she says, that he was a Casanova psychopath who saw her as a cash cow and was motivated by money and his own ego.</p>
      <p>It ground her down – and made her the target for another man with whom she had an affair, and who would go on to drag her by the hair from a car she’d bought him.</p>
      <p>She was working out in the gym when he first approached her, making it abundantly clear he was interested in her.</p>
      <p>He flattered her, told her she was beautiful and amazing.</p>

      <p>On reflection, Lucy – who has diplomas in mental health and brain development – said: “It is called ‘love bombing’ – when somebody with toxic tendencies sets their sights on someone.</p>
      <p>“It’s intoxicating but you ignore the sense of a runaway train, as they just seem perfect for you, mirroring your lifestyle, desires and plans for the future – on purpose.”</p>
      <p>Six months later, Lucy – now a mum of three – entered into a physical relationship with him.</p>
      <p>“I thought I could trust myself. He had successfully made me feel incredible and special and in control,” she said.</p>
      <p>“But after the first sexual encounter, he changed. He started blowing hot and cold. It’s called ‘ghosting’ or ‘discarding’.”</p>
      <p>After confessing her affair to her partner, both men ended their relationships with her.</p>
      <p>Admitting she was besotted with the man with whom she’d had an affair, he continued to come in and out of her life, making unreasonable demands while struggling with a long-term addiction to alcohol and valium, leaving her feeling used, exhausted and confused.</p>
      <p>Her accounts of the on-off, controlling relationship are harrowing.</p>
      <p>“I was sucked in, chewed up and spat out of a ‘loving relationship’ that simply ruined my bank balance, career and overall mental health,” said Lucy, 38, who claims she bought her lover a car and paid for them to go on a luxury foreign holiday together.</p>
      <p>She herself received a criminal conviction for stalking another woman he’d also been seeing long-term by telephone.</p>
      <p>Lucy says she became painfully thin, drank too much and even fantasised about killing him.</p>
      <p>“I was mourning him and grieving him. I planned how I was going to kill myself. I checked my life insurance,” said Lucy, who now lives in Glasgow with her kids.</p>
      <p>“I knew how ruined I was. Everyone knew. I was all for doing it. But something in me just said, ‘these people do not deserve to win’.”</p>
      <p>When she finally mustered the courage to tell him it was over after 18 months, she admits to embarking on a pattern of behaviours that “overstepped several boundaries”.</p>
      <p>“I totally degraded myself,” she admits.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t care. I could have lost my kids. I had a breakdown. Night terrors, hallucinations. I firmly believe my brain and morality went.</p>
      <p>“I still have a semi-addiction to dangerous men with no jobs, tattoos and criminal convictions.</p>
      <p>“I thought I was in control by entering relationships in which there was no love – quite cold, but satisfying relationships. Fun, but dark fun. It was not right.</p>
      <p>“I have rebuilt my sense of morality. I have done a lot of work on my risk-taking and my own impulsivity. You never truly move on after what you have been through.</p>
      <p>“Even if it is a nice guy, you scare them off and they don’t understand.”</p>
      <p>She began writing the book, which she describes as a labour of love, three years ago.</p>
      <p>As it progressed, she realised the prose was “whingeing”, and she dramatically changed its tone and called on her studies and experience in charity work and enterprise to turn it into more of a training, educational tool, with what she calls ‘red flag’ warnings to “protect other lassies” at risk of falling prey to controlling people.</p>
      <p>Lucy hopes it will help not only victims and survivors, but also professionals interested in improving judicial, social care and health systems.</p>
      <p>The book is broken into three stages – love bombing, the devaluation and the ultimate discard, and aims to teach women the characteristics of people with narcissistic personality disorder.</p>
      <p>“There is still no book like it,” she insists.</p>
      <p>“There are lots of memoirs and self-help books. But in this, I talk about my own slide. I want to help other women by being totally authentic and honest.”</p>
      <p>Last week, she volunteered to run a workshop for a cancer charity, alerting people living with the illness about Machiavellianism – one of the traits in what is called the Dark Triad of personality traits.</p>
      <p>Lucy offers free coaching to victims of such individuals and has almost finished her second book on the same vein, called The Notch.</p>
      <p>She is working on developing other practices to spread awareness and understanding of toxic people in relationships, workplaces and friendships.</p>
      <p>Dangerous Normal People by LW Hawksby is available to order from Waterstones. A percentage of the profits from the sale of her books is donated to human and animal-focused charities.</p>
