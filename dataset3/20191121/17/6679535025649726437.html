      <p>The Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&amp;SB) has announced voluntary disclosure scheme (VDS) for getting illegal drinking water connections regularised.</p>
      <p>The scheme will commence on November 22, and continue for 90 days up to February 21, 2020.</p>
      <p>According to the scheme, the connections may be regularised merely through payment of connection charges, and one month’s water bill. Earlier, to get an illegal connection regularised, one had to pay three years’ water bills and double the connection charges.</p>
      <p>After the 90-day period, the same charges would be applicable, in addition to ₹300 service charge, a press statement said.</p>
      <p>Of the 472 million gallons drinking water the board is supplying, 37 per cent was being wasted for different reasons, resulting in loss of revenue for the board, which was spending ₹47 for every 100 litres to bring water from Krishna and Godavari rivers located 200 kms away from the city, the statement said.</p>
      <p>Monthly loss incurred by the water board for such reasons was put at ₹20 crore.</p>
      <p>Those who wish to avail themselves of the scheme may contact their nearest HMWS&amp;SB office or call the toll-free number 155313.</p>
