      <p>MADISON, Wis. - Thanksgiving meal food prices have remained stable in Wisconsin this year, according to the Wisconsin Farm Bureau's annual Marketbasket Survey.</p>
      <p>According to a release, the Marketbasket Survey is an informal look at the price of popular food items used to prepare a Thanksgiving meal serving 10 people. Wisconsin food prices can be compared with food prices across the country. </p>
      <p>This year, the state survey found Wisconsin's total was $61.57 in 2019, which is a slight increase from last year's $60.17 total. The national total was $62.32 in 2019.</p>
      <p>"Thanksgiving is a time for many Wisconsin families to gather around the dinner table and enjoy a home-cooked meal that consists of many local food products," said Wisconsin Farm Bureau's Director of Communications Sarah Hetke. </p>
      <p>To complete the survey, Wisconsin Farm Bureau members collected price samples of 15 food items, including turkey, cranberries, sweet potatoes and rolls, at 29 communities in November.</p>
      <p>The volunteers looked for best possible prices without using coupons or promotional deals, the release said.</p>
      <p>Farmers' share has decreased steadily in retail grocery prices and is now at 14.6%. Out of the $61.57, farmers' share is $8.98.</p>
      <p>"After accounting for bills and other payments that need to be made, farmers' net income off each retail food dollar is just 8 cents," Hetke said. "Wisconsin shoppers can support farmers by purchasing food products that are grown and raised in our state and across the Midwest." </p>
