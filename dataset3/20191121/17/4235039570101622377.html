      <p>The <b>Netherlands</b> is sending new messages to the world by changing its logo as a national brand. It reflects the idea of ​​identifying the country as a natural union of the <b>Netherlands</b> and the Kingdom of the Netherlands. For this reason, The new logo features the letters “NL”, designed to depict a stylised <b>tulip</b>, with “<b>Netherlands</b>” written alongside it. The logo replaces the well known Holland tulip.</p>
      <p>The new visual identity was developed by Government Dumbar Studio. The effect sought is to show more clearly what the <b>Netherlands</b> has to offer. "The new logo can be applied across different industries, from high tech to agrifood and from sport to culture. A clear international image is positive for exports and [the] attraction of investment and talent. ", said Dutch Foreign Minister Sigrid Kaag.</p>
      <p>"It is important to convey to the world what we are good at. According to the World Economic Forum, the <b>Netherlands</b> is Europe's most competitive economy and the fourth most competitive in the world, "commented Minister of Economic Affairs and Climate Eric Wiebes.</p>
      <p>The new logo can be used by government, educational and private organizations working on joint projects with government institutions since January 2020.</p>
