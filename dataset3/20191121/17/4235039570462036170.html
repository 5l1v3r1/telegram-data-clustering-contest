      <p>The social network <b>Facebook</b> plans to donate $ 7 million to <b>charity</b> as part of its <b>GivingTuesday</b> <b>campaign</b>, traditionally held on Tuesday after Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>On December 3, hundreds of US non-governmental organizations will receive funding for their causes from a platform that promises to cover taxes on donated funds, so that 100% of them will be used as intended. To help the most needy, <b>Facebook</b> announced that it will donate a maximum of $ 100,000 to each organization.</p>
      <p>The company is also launching new <b>charity</b> buttons. One is for Instagram business accounts and the other is on the <b>Facebook</b> Stories tab and is in the form of a sticker. Live broadcast, or so-called Livestreaming, often used by gamers, could also support a cause if they choose to add a special button to encourage their viewers to donate to a <b>charity</b> of their choice.</p>
