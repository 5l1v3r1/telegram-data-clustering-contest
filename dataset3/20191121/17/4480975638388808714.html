      <h1>Oil prices making tracks to key 61.8% Fibo target, boosted by OPEC sentiment</h1>

      <p>Oil prices have been trading on the bid over the past twenty-four hours, with West Texas Intermediate crude, (WTI), rising from a low of $56.59 to a high of $58.25, adding 1.91% at the time of writing as investors bank on production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, (OPEC), and its allies. </p>
      <p>At the time of writing, WTI is trading at $58.15 and close to its highest levels of the day so far despite US benchmarks in the red. While there had been a report earlier in the Wall Street Journal which stated that China’s top trade negotiator invited his U.S. counterparts to a new round of face-to-face talks, stocks were unable to garner much impetus from that and instead investors are more concerned over a number of prior headlines in the week so far that are quite to the contrary of such optimism.  For oil, we had news that Yemeni Houthis claimed to shoot down a Saudi coalition F-15 which helped boost oil prices. Also, US inventory builds were not as bad as expected.</p>
      <h3>WTI gets a boost on OPEC</h3>
      <p>Oil was also lifted on the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> that OPEC and its allies, including Russia, will probably agree to continue with production cuts when they meet in Vienna on the 5th and 6th of December, a long await meeting from where investors hope oil will find some traction – Reuters was citing OPEC sources with that story. </p>
      <p>However, to the contrary, analysts at TD Securities argued that with "large surpluses in early 2020 still linger on the horizon, especially as OPEC+ appear hesitant to deepen output cuts when they meet in December — we would not be surprised to see prices move back to the low $50s into 2020."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h4>WTI levels</h4>
      <p>The price is up to the highest levels since late September, breaking the 57.80/90 <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> with 58.60/80 on the map, a confluence of the 61.8% Fibonacci level of the Sep 19 highs and October lows and the late July highs. 60.80 is a confluence of the 78.6% Fibo and July highs. 55 the figure, as trend line support, guards a run back to the 23.6% Fibo of the same range located around 53.90 and late Oct lows a fraction below there. </p>
