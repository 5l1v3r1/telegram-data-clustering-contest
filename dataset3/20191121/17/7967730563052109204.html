      <h1>How to manage entitled employees</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:32:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:32</time> by <a rel="author">James Adonis</a></address>
      <p>It was almost eighty years ago that Sir Robert Menzies, in between prime ministerships, aired his <i>Forgotten People</i> speech which distinguished between two groups of Australians – lifters and leaners. "Leaners grow flabby," he said. "Lifters grow muscles."</p>
      <p>It's a muscular turn of phrase that has survived the eight decades since the midpoint of World War II to still be part of the Aussie vernacular such that it continues to be used when referring, for instance, to <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p515ug.html">the unemployed</a> or to <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-h1bh8z.html">government lobbyists</a> and even, as we’ll learn today via soon-to-be-published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-019-04246-0">research</a>, to a small but growing proportion of the workforce.</p>

      <p>That substantial minority reflects those afflicted to some degree by a sense of entitlement. Work is less about what they can contribute and more about what they can take. And, according to dozens of prior studies, it’s on the rise, can lead to workplace dysfunction and diminishes their own job satisfaction. So, all in all, it isn’t a pleasant experience for them, their colleagues or their managers.</p>
      <p>Of course, we’re not talking here about employees who are legitimately dissatisfied with their employment conditions due to, say, being denied fair pay or flexible work practices. We’re talking about those who consistently believe they deserve special treatment and generous rewards irrespective of their abilities or levels of performance.</p>
      <p>As a result of that incongruence between the privileges they feel they’re owed and their inflated sense of self-worth, they don’t work as hard for their employer, preferring instead to slacken off. It’s a tendency many scholars believe begins in childhood due to parents who overindulge their kids, thereby leading them to expect the same kind of pampering throughout their adult lives.</p>
      <p>And yet despite how these employees feel, it’s obviously important for their manager to nonetheless find out how to keep them motivated and, by virtue of that heightened motivation, to perform well. Which is where the new research I mentioned earlier comes in.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s a tendency many scholars believe begins in childhood due to parents who overindulge their kids.</blockquote>
      <p>Led by Dr Toby Joplin and three professorial colleagues from several American universities, the team set out to discover how entitled employees could become engaged. They surveyed more than 240 individuals, which comprised not only team members but their managers as well.</p>
      <p>Employee entitlement was measured by statements such as this one: "I honestly feel I’m just more deserving than others", to which the respondents had to rate the extent of their agreement. Employee engagement, meanwhile, was assessed with statements like this: "I really throw myself into my work."</p>
      <p>The findings revealed ethical leadership is precisely what mitigates the negative effects of employee entitlement. That’s because "rather than indulging employees or neglecting [them], ethical leaders communicate very direct and clear expectations, hold employees accountable for their behaviours, and are committed to doing the right thing. Additionally, these leaders are consistent in their standards and are less likely to waiver in how they treat employees."</p>

      <p>This means, when confronted by an entitled team member, an ethical leader is significantly disinclined to accommodate their demands and to instead point out, constructively and tactfully, exactly how their inflated sense of deservingness is somewhat skewed. They’d then go further, as a coach, to explain the specific (and objective) criteria the employee must meet to receive their desired rewards.</p>
      <p>This shift away from unrealistic expectations is successful because entitled employees "feel more confident that [ethical] leaders will deliver on their promises" since they're perceived to be "fair and trustworthy".</p>
      <p>The scholars, however, exercise caution by warning "no one single response is the perfect antidote" but there’s no denying ethical leadership is at least a critical step in the right direction.</p>
