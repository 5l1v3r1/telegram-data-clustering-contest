      <p>With the arrest of a city-based gynaecologist and an autorickshaw driver, the Chaitanyapuri police on Thursday unearthed a racket which was illegally conducting pre-natal sex determination tests.</p>
      <p>They were charging ₹9,000 for each patient to reveal the gender of the unborn child, inspector S Janaki Reddy said. The police raided Ushodaya Diagnostic Centre, following a complaint lodged by Dr. A. Bala Narender, Programme Officer for District Training.</p>
      <p>“We found that three pregnant women were in the queue for the ultrasound test to identify the gender of their unborn child,” the officer said.</p>
      <p>The auto driver, Anjaneyulu (33) from Srinagar Colony, used to bring the patients to the centre. Dr. Sarala’s assistant Ayesh Fatima was also arrested by the police.</p>
      <p>A case under Section 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of IPC and Section 23 of Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act was booked against the trio.</p>
