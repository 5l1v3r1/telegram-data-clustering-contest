      <p>The book is called <i>Get Started with Arduino</i>, and it it is published by Raspberry Pi Press, at a price of £10.00. As well as buying it online, you can buy it from the Raspberry Pi shop in Cambridge, and from WHSmith everywhere else.</p>
      <p>The team <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/get-started-ardunio/">writes</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>Yes, you read that title right, and no, you haven’t accidentally stumbled upon the Arduino Foundation’s website. Today, we’re pleased to announce a new addition to the Raspberry Pi Press family: <i>Get Started with Arduino</i>, a complete how-to guide to help you get hands on with the other pocket-sized board.<br/><br/>Why not? Our mission is to put the power of computing and digital making into the hands of people all over the world. Whether you’re using a Raspberry Pi, an Arduino, or any other piece of digital making kit, if you’re creating with tech, we’re happy. And Raspberry Pi and Arduino make wonderful project partners for all kinds of build.</blockquote>
      <p>As an example of the two systems working together, they cite robotic control, where the Pi could handle intensive processing tasks and and the Arduino handles real-time control of the motors.</p>

      <p>You can see the contents page, right, for an idea of the range of projects covered.</p>
      <p>They include Building a games console, building an infrared repeater to control the TV, creating a polyphonic digital synthesiser and a Wi-Fi Tetris clock, no less. Plus lot’s more…</p>
      <p>And so, in a development board sense, the lion has laid down with the lamb. Concordat in Regnum, as my Latin teacher didn’t say.</p>
      <p>You can read more on <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/get-started-ardunio/">RaspberryPi.org</a> (it’s certainly worth a visit if you are interested in the book).</p>
      <p>Don’t forget, each purchase of the book will help fund the good work of the Raspberry Pi foundation.</p>
