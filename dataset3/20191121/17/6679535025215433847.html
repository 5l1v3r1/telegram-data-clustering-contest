      <h2>It vows to pursue nationalisation policy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:11:10+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Associated-Press-7158/" target="_blank">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p>Britain’s main opposition Labour Party promised on Thursday to radically expand public spending and State ownership if it wins the December 12 election, trying to close an opinion-poll gap with the governing Conservatives.</p>
      <p>The party said a Labour government would nationalise Britain’s railways, energy utilities and postal system, cap rents, hike the minimum wage and abolish university tuition fees.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the platform a “manifesto of hope.” Critics called it a pipe dream.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed for Britain to hold the December election, which is taking place more than two years early, in hopes winning a majority and breaking Britain’s political impasse over Brexit. All 650 seats in the House of Commons are up for grabs.</p>
      <p>Labour’s ambitious manifesto is an attempt to shift the focus of the campaign from Britain’s stalled departure from the European Union and onto the country’s fraying social fabric, stressed after a decade of austerity measures under Conservative-led governments.</p>
      <p>The platform revives policies of nationalisation and central government control that have been jettisoned since the 1980s.</p>
