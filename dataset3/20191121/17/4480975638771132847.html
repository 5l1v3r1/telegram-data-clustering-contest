      <p>Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said that she would re-evaluate the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> if there were signs of weakness in hiring or consumer spending.</p>
      <p>"Risks to the economy are still tilted slightly to the downside," Mester added while speaking to reporters after delivering her opening remarks at a conference on financial stability hosted by the Cleveland <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a>. "I expect the US economy to grow by an average of 2% this year and for inflation to be slightly below 2%."</p>
      <p>These comments don't seem to be having a significant impact on the USD's valuation. As of writing, the US Dollar Index was up 0.08% on the day at 97.95.</p>
