      <p>Skincare is expensive. Lemme just say that. Acne cream, moisturisers, toner, serum, Vitamin-B complex, exfoliating cream and the list goes on and on. And to cope with that, some of us find alternative treatment which works, and if it does, GOOD FOR YOU! This girl found a treatment method thatâ€™sâ€¦ purrfect, Iâ€™d say?</p>
      <p>Dinda from Indonesia has found a way to reduce her acne, which is getting her cat, Nia, to lick her face â€“ and it worked!</p>

      <p>According to her, the cat not only gets rid of acne but also softens her skin. Maybe itâ€™s cute? Maybe?</p>

      <p>This technique has been confirmed by none other than Dindaâ€™s own sister, Debi, who said that Dinda has been letting her cat lick her face for the past three months and has seen that Dindaâ€™s acne has apparently cleared up significantly. Thereâ€™s an oddity to this too (amongst other things) as the cat ONLY licks Dindaâ€™s face.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Well, no judgement, so if it works for Dinda, good for her. The question is, how do I get my pet cat to willingly lick my face because I canâ€™t afford any more skincare?</i>
