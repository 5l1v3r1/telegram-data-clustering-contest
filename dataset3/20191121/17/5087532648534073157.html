      <p>Some Apple Stores in the are testing a new program that lets customers buy AppleCare+ plans that go beyond the current deadline which is 60 days after the purchase date (<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/21/apple-store-extended-applecare-pilot-program/">via</a> <i>MacRumors</i>).</p>
      <h3>Extended AppleCare+</h3>
      <p>The new extended AppleCare+ plans are definitely being offered for the iPhone and possibly also other devices like the Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac. Under this program Apple customers can add an AppleCare+ plan to their device between 61 days and one year after purchase.</p>
      <p>A source said itâ€™s being piloted across 50 Apple Stores in the U.S. and 29 in Canada. To be eligible a customer needs to book a Genius Bar appointment. A technician will perform an inspection and run diagnostics on the device.</p>
