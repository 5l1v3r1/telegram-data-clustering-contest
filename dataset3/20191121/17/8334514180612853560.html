      <p>The Tampa Bay Rays designated infielder Matt Duffy for assignment and traded right-hander Jose De Leon to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for a player to be named and cash.</p>
      <p>Duffy, 28, batted .252 with one home run and 12 RBIs in 46 games last season. He has a .282 batting average with 22 homers and 169 RBIs in 452 career games with the San Francisco Giants and Rays.</p>
      <p>“(Duffy’s) a special player,” Rays general manager Erik Neander said. “I think his intangibles, his leadership and his influence on a younger and personable clubhouse like we have is worth a lot. And that especially made this a very difficult decision, and we will certainly miss him in that regard.”</p>
      <p>De Leon, 27, returned from Tommy John surgery and posted a 1-0 record with a 2.25 ERA in four innings with the Rays last season. He is 4-0 with a 6.08 ERA in eight career games with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Rays.</p>
