      <h1>Netanyahu indicted on corruption charges</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:11:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/tal-axelrod" target="_blank">Tal Axelrod</a></address>
      <p>Israeli Prime Minister <a href="https://thehill.com/people/benjamin-bibi-netanyahu">Benjamin Netanyahu</a> has been indicted in three corruption cases, marking the first time a sitting head of state in Israel will face criminal charges.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu was charged Thursday with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The indictment follows a four-day hearing last month with the prime minister’s defense team.</p>
      <p>The first case, which is considered to be the most serious, accuses Netanyahu of bribery for allegedly engaging in a quid pro quo deal with businessman and media mogul Shaul Elovich in which Netnayahu, during his tenure as communication minister, spearheaded regulations that helped Elovich gain roughly $500 million, <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/netanyahu-charged-bribery-fraud-corruption-israel-election-1.8137771">Haaretz reported</a>. In return, Netanyahu and his wife allegedly repeatedly requested alterations to Walla News, which Elovich ran, to serve their political interests and undercut their opponents.</p>
      <p>The Netanyahus have argued the deal does not constitute a bribe and that they only sought balanced coverage.</p>
      <p>The second case accuses Netanyahu and Arnon Mozes, the publisher of the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, of trying to limit the circulation of a rival paper in return for favorable media coverage. The case, known as Case 2000, accuses Netanyahu of fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>The final case accuses Netanyahu of fraud and breach of trust for allegedly using his public role to receive gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and billionaire James Packer.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison if he is convicted of bribery and a maximum of three years for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, is not required to step down as a result of the charges. He can ask the parliament for immunity, though that request would have to be considered by a special committee that has not been established due to ongoing gridlock.</p>
      <p>The indictment casts further uncertainty over Netanyahu’s political future. Israel appears to be headed toward an unprecedented third election in less than a year after Netanyahu’s chief rival <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/middle-east-north-africa/471388-chances-of-third-israeli-election-rise-after">announced Wednesday</a> he would miss a deadline to form a ruling coalition.</p>
      <p>The parliament now starts a 21-day period in which it can try to nominate any one of its 120 lawmakers to try and establish a coalition. Should that effort fail, an election would be triggered within 90 days.</p>
      <p>If Netanyahu were to win a new election, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin would be forced to decide if he can give Netanyahu the mandate to form the next government given the criminal charges against him.</p>
