      <p>This is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeffrey-epstein">Jeffrey Epstein's</a> 10,000-acre ranch with an underground strip club, an eight-person shower and cameras in every room.</p>
      <p>The late convicted sex offender brought VIP guests to the secluded Zorro Ranch in New Mexico a few times a year.</p>
      <p>Images from inside the property show a winding staircase leading downstairs - and it is claimed Epstein had an underground 'strip club' for entertaining his visitors with teenage girls.</p>
      <p>"I had seen things in the house, on the computers, which made me evaluate whether I should be working for him or not," a former contractor told Albuquerque radio.</p>
      <p>"There was numerous photographs in frames, in his library, his office, on the walls, of young underage girls topless and him and various other powerful people."</p>

      <p>The contractor also claimed Epstein had sculptures of a 'sexual nature'.</p>
      <p>He said 'everybody would get in' the 'party' shower.</p>
      <p>Another source claimed there were secret cameras in every room.</p>

      <p>Pictures of the ranch, released by the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7703257/New-photos-Jeffrey-Epsteins-New-Mexico-ranch-pedophiles-eight-person-party-shower.html">Daily Mail</a>, show the estate's vast scrubland, with outhouses in the middle of the acres of land.</p>
      <p>The home is even said to have its own small airport.</p>
      <p>Inside, the apparent 'party shower' is lined with oils and toiletries.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile an indoor bathing area has a big pool and a hot tub.</p>

      <p>In a library, antique furniture fills the room along with Gothic chandeliers.</p>
      <p>The anonymous contractor said: "It's a huge home, when you approach it, it looks like a resort hotel, way up on the hill, you can barely see it from the town down below, and there's a long loop road up there and he's got a small airport. "</p>

      <p>He said Epstein would go to the ranch a couple of times a year with an entourage of  about 30 people who he would party with.</p>
      <p>Another former contractor told the radio station that underground in the property, Epstein had a 'club' with poles.</p>
      <p>He said it was used for dancing and entertainment but staff were not allowed down there.</p>
      <p>The ranch is one of several homes which Epstein had.</p>

      <p>Epstein, 66, was found hanging in his Manhattan jail cell - where he was awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges he denied - and he was pronounced dead in hospital a short time later.</p>
      <p>The disgraced financier's death on August 10 was ruled a suicide by New York City's chief medical examiner.</p>
      <p>He was not sharing a cell with another prisoner at the time of his death.</p>
