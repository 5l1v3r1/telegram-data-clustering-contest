      <p>“You are an amazing icon and a beloved icon,” Trump said to Voight before adding that he is also “somebody I really like.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Voight’s daughter Angelina Jolie is an outspoke anti-Trump supporter. She recently spoke to ET Canada about the impeachment inquiry where she said, “We live in a country of laws. I don’t believe it should be my opinion. Something as serious as impeachment… It is about the facts and law and I have to trust that it will work itself out.”</p>
