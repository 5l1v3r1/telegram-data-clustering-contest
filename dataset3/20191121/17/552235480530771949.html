      <h1>Albion Rovers will need derby day passion like my 7-2 heroes says legendary ex-boss Paul Martin</h1>
      <h2>It was an unforgettable moment for Rovers as they look to pull off another big shock this weekend against Airdrieonians.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Pirie, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/mark-pirie/</a></address>
      <p>Remember, remember the fifth of November – and Paul Martin always will after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/the-fans-every-right-angry-20678455">Albion Rovers</a> romped to derby day victory back in 2011.</p>
      <p>Martin was in the dugout as Rovers romped to a 7-2 victory over their Monklands rivals.</p>
      <p>It was the first time in 35 years that the fans in Cliftonhill had earned bragging rights over their Airdrie counterparts and Martin admits he still gets texts about it every bonfire night.</p>
      <p>“Frank Meade, who was chairman at the time, always texts to tell me to remember, remember,” Martin laughs.</p>
      <p>“I still get fans or a couple of pals who text me about it.</p>
      <p>“It’s a result that at the time I didn’t realise I would still be talking about it all these years later.”</p>
      <p>However, it’s these moments that stick in fans’ minds with doubles from John Gemmell and Mick O’Byrne as well as a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/albion-rovers-legend-scott-chaplain-12313617">Scott Chaplain hat-trick living long in the memory.</a></p>

      <p>The Rovers’ Hall of Fame inductee believes it was the passion his men played with that led to the blockbuster scoreline.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old said: “We had a fairly decent side at the time and so did Airdrie. They were looking at promotion and we were new to the division.</p>
      <p>“They had beat us 4-0 in the first game that season and we were really disappointed. We felt like tactically we had done everything we could have, but didn’t have the right mentality for the game.</p>
      <p>“We collapsed but we all knew we could do better because we were a decent team.</p>
      <p>“We changed that in the second game and made it less tactical. I wanted to see more passion in the team and we got them really fired up before the game.</p>
      <p>“That was the big thing in that game, five minutes before we left the changing room everyone couldn’t wait to get on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“It’s a battle and I wanted my players to be the team who put the gas in the game.”</p>

      <p>Despite admitting he “never for a second thought it would be 7-2” he feels the big moments went Albion Rovers’ way.</p>
      <p>He reckons Kevin Harper will need that slice of luck if the current crop in Coatbridge are to pull off a shock.</p>
      <p>Martin said: “The game was probably tighter than a 7-2.</p>
      <p>“At one point we are 4-1 ahead, and Airdrie have a penalty. <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/arbroath-newboy-reveals-how-dick-16506847">Derek Gaston</a> makes a great save, and John Gemmell goes up the other end and scores a volley from 30 yards to make it five from the break away.</p>
      <p>“That minute really took the heart out of Airdrie and meant that we went on to score more.</p>
      <p>“There were so many highlights in that game and it was an all round great performance.</p>
      <p>“It clicked for us that day, and Kevin will need that to happen for his players.</p>
      <p>“When you play for Albion Rovers you have less and less chances to do something for the fans, and the chairman, and everyone involved with the club.</p>
      <p>“You need to make sure that you are ready for the challenge in these moments.”</p>
