      <h1>Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu indicted on corruption charges</h1>

      <p>Israel’s attorney general announced Thursday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be charged in a series of corruption cases, threatening the longtime leader’s grip on power in a country mired in political chaos after two inconclusive elections.</p>
      <p>In his long-awaited announcement, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said Netanyahu will face charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud — becoming the first sitting Israeli prime minister to be charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, the embattled leader wrongfully accepted $264,000 worth of gifts — including cigars and champagne — from tycoons, offered to trade favors with a newspaper publisher and used his influence to help a wealthy telecom magnate in exchange for favorable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>A defiant Netanyahu — who has been prime minister since 2009 and served a previous term between 1996 and 1999 — has strenuously denied any wrongdoing in the three cases and called the allegations a media-orchestrated witch hunt aimed at kicking him from office.</p>
      <p>In the co-called “Case 4000,” the most serious of the three, he faces a charge of bribery for allegedly influencing regulatory decisions that netted hundreds of millions of dollars for a telecom giant in exchange for positive coverage on its subsidiary news site Walla.</p>
      <p>The allegations involve his “bribe-based relationship” with Shaul Elovitch, the Bezeq company’s controlling shareholder. Mandelblit also intends to charge Elovitch with bribery, according to the Times of Israel.</p>
      <p>In “Case 1000,” where Netanyahu is accused of accepting gifts and benefits worth about $300,000 from business executives — including Israeli-born Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan — in return for political favors, he faces charges of fraud and breach of trust. Milchan will not be charged.</p>
      <p>And in “Case 2000,” Netanyahu faces charges of fraud and breach of trust for allegedly agreeing with newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth’s publisher Arnon Mozes to promote a bill to restrict the circulation of the daily’s main competitor, Israel Hayom, in exchange for favorable coverage. Mozes will be charged with bribery.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is under no legal obligation to resign, though he will likely face calls to step down. If he is ultimately cleared, it would give him a major boost as the Jewish state braces for a possible third election in under a year.</p>
      <p>It could take months before formal charges are filed, since Netanyahu is expected to ask the Knesset for parliamentary immunity, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/ag-announces-netanyahu-to-stand-trial-for-bribery-fraud-and-breach-of-trust/">according to the Times of Israel</a>.</p>
      <p>Only once a new coalition is formed — or after the next round of elections slated for March — can a Knesset committee take up the question.</p>
      <p>Even if Netanyahu’s immunity request is rejected, it could take until May or June for a formal decision to be issued, while a formal indictment could still be more than seven months away, the news outlet reported.</p>
      <p>Thursday’s decision comes at a tumultuous time for the country.</p>
      <p>After an inconclusive election in September, both Netanyahu and his chief rival, former military chief of staff Benny Gantz, have failed to form a majority coalition in parliament.</p>
      <p>The country now enters an unprecedented 21-day period in which any member of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, can try to rally a 61-member majority to become prime minister. If that fails, new elections would be triggered for early 2020.</p>
      <p>President Reuven Rivlin formally informed the Knesset of the deadlock on Thursday, a day after Gantz’s window for forming a government expired, calling it a “miserable political situation” and pleading with lawmakers to find a compromise.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu is desperate to remain in office, where he would be best positioned to fight criminal charges — but he could come under pressure to step aside, even from within his ruling Likud party, whose leaders have so far remained solidly behind him.</p>
      <p>A recent poll by the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, found that 65 percent of Israelis thought Netanyahu should resign as head of the Likud party if indicted, with 24 percent opposed.</p>
      <p>In the first sign of rebellion, Netanyahu’s top Likud rival on Thursday called for a leadership primary should the country head to new elections.</p>
      <p>Gideon Saar said he supports the establishment of a unity government with Gantz’s Blue and White Party to avert another election.</p>
      <p>“If we go to new elections, it will not be reasonable to think that the prime minister will be successful in forming a government after the third elections,” Saar said. “I think I will be able to form a government, and I think I will be able to unite the country and the nation.”</p>
      <p>Netanyahu’s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, who resigned before he was indicted on corruption charges a decade ago, later served 16 months behind bars for fraud and bribery.</p>
