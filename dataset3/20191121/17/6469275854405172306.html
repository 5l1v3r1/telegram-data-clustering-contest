      <p>It happened at around 9.45am on July 3 last year, as Cartmell travelled southbound in a dangerous manner.</p>
      <p>His vehicle was involved in a collision with a Volkswagen Up, which had been travelling northbound.</p>
      <p>Emergency services attended and Mrs Ball, a passenger in the Volkswagen, was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
      <p>Mrs Murphy, who was driving, was removed from the vehicle and taken to Royal Preston Hospital for treatment, but later died.</p>
      <p>The road was closed for several hours while the tragedy was investigated.</p>
      <p>It is understood a memorial service for the two friends took place at Hollins Lane Methodist Church, Forton.</p>
      <p>The case is adjourned until his sentencing on December 4.</p>
      <p>The maximum sentence courts can impose for causing death by dangerous driving or careless driving is 14 years, with a minimum disqualification of two years and compulsory extended retest.</p>
