      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- One day after she was indicted on 11 federal counts of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, former Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors, reports said Thursday.</p>
      <p>The charges involve the sales of her <i>Healthy Holly</i> line of children's books.</p>
      <p>Pugh was set to appear in court Thursday afternoon, and was expected to plead guilty to at least some of the charges. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-baltimore-mayor-to-plead-guilty-in-fraud-case-11574353592">Wall Street Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/catherine-pugh-indicted-plea-baltimore/29869141">WBAL-TV</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/former-baltimore-mayor-catherine-e-pugh-has-reached-an-agreement-to-plead-guilty-two-people-familiar-with-the-deal-say/2019/11/21/d3e8499e-0bd7-11ea-bd9d-c628fd48b3a0_story.html">Washington Post</a> all reported the plea deal.</p>
      <p>"I think there's a plea agreement in place, and we know that because this case, it's scheduling is skipping earlier parts of the process," Baltimore attorney Andrew Alperstein <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/baltimore-attorney-previews-what-could-happen-next-in-catherine-pugh-case/29864100#">said</a>. "The initial appearance is being done at the same time as the arraignment -- that doesn't normally happen that way, and usually the only reason that happens is if she's going to plead guilty."</p>
      <p>Other observers said the unique agenda could indicate a not guilty plea, followed by a discussion of bail and future court dates.</p>
      <p>Pugh was charged <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/11/20/Prosecutors-charge-ex-Baltimore-mayor-with-fraud-tax-evasion/1281574255983/?upi_ss=baltimore">Wednesday</a> in a 34-page indictment based on what prosecutors said was years of investigation. The charges say Pugh was involved in a corrupt scheme involving her book sales and used proceeds to enrich and promote herself. The scheme, prosecutors said, included $500,000 for 100,000 books sold to the University of Maryland Medical System while she was a board member on a Senate committee that partly funded the hospital.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Pugh sometimes failed to print or deliver sold books and avoided public payment disclosures to avoid paying taxes. She has so far returned $100,000.</p>
      <p>Pugh, 69, became mayor of Baltimore in 2016 and resigned after her home was raided by federal agents <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2019/04/25/Federal-agents-raid-home-office-of-Baltimore-Mayor-Catherine-Pugh/1641556199207/">in April</a>.</p>
