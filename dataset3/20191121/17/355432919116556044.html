      <h1>Poll: Buttigieg holds 7-point lead in Iowa, followed by Warren, Sanders</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:34:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/tal-axelrod" target="_blank">Tal Axelrod</a></address>
      <p>South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> has a 7-point lead over his Democratic presidential rivals in Iowa, marking the third consecutive poll to show him leading in the Hawkeye State.</p>
      <p>Buttigieg gets the support of 26 percent of likely Democratic Iowa caucusgoers in the <a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_ISU_banner_book_2019_11.pdf">Civiqs-Iowa State University poll</a> released Thursday, while Sens. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) and <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) battle for second place at 19 percent and 18 percent, respectively.</p>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> comes in fourth at 12 percent. No other candidate breaks double digits.</p>
      <p>Only 3 percent of likely caucusgoers said they were unsure of who they’d support if the race was decided today.</p>
      <p>The poll showed Buttigieg with a 4-point lead among voters aged 35-49, and a 9-point lead among voters aged 65 years and up.</p>
      <p>The Civiqs-Iowa State University poll follows a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom survey showing Buttigieg with <a href="https://thehill.com/campaign-polls/470799-buttigieg-rockets-to-frontrunner-in-iowa-poll">a 9-point lead</a> and a <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_ia_111219/">Monmouth University poll</a> showing him with a 3-point advantage in Iowa.</p>
      <p>In another sign of growing momentum, a new poll released Wednesday showed Buttigieg with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/471187-buttigieg-surges-to-10-point-lead-in-new-hampshire-poll">a 10-point lead</a> in New Hampshire, which will hold the nation’s second nominating contest following Iowa.</p>
      <p>The Civiqs-Iowa State University poll surveyed 614 likely Iowa Democratic caucusgoers from Nov. 15-19 and has a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points.</p>
