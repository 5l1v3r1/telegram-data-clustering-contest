      <p>Anime streaming site Crunchyroll has provided CBR with an exclusive look at its <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/one-piece/">One Piece</a> </i>"Devil Fruit" capsule collection of streetwear, which launches today.</p>
      <p>Below, you'll find the first images of the limited clothing line, which features five different items: two short-sleeve tees, two long-sleeve tees and one hoodie, with designs inspired by the mysterious fruits from Eiichiro Oda's hit pirate manga and anime series that grant those that consume them a unique superpower.</p>

      <p>Crunchyroll's previous collections, released under the brand's in-house streetwear line Crunchyroll Loves, have included popular manga/anime properties like <i>Konosuba</i>, <i>RE:Zero</i>, <i>Mob Psycho</i> <i>100</i>, <i>RWBY</i>, as well as one devoted to the work of Junji Ito, famed creator of manga horror classics like <i>Uzumaki</i>. The Devil Fruit collection, however, is not part of this line.</p>
      <p><i>One Piece </i>fans will be quick to spot, among others, the purple Gum Gum Fruit in the image above, which gave Straw Hat Captain Luffy his versatile "rubber human abilities."</p>
      <p>Crunchyroll's <i>One Piece</i> "Devil Fruit" capsule collection is available now.</p>
