      <p><b>NEW YORKÂ (AP)</b> - WeWork is slashing nearly 20% of its workforce in the wake of its failed stock market debut.</p>
      <p>The shared office space company said it has laid off 2,400 of its approximately 12,500 employees to "create a more efficient organization." WeWork said the job cuts began weeks ago in regions around the world and continued this week in the U.S.</p>
      <p>WeWork is restructuring its money-losing business model, which turned off Wall Street investors and forced the company to pull out of an IPO.</p>
      <p>Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank saved WeWork from the brink of bankruptcy with a $9.5 billion bailout.</p>
      <p>WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann was forced out of the company with a $1.7 billion payout, stoking resentment among some employees now facing layoffs and a reduction in the value of their stock options.</p>
