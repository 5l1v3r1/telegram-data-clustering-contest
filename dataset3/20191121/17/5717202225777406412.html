      <p>Gianfranco Zola has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT (Thursday, 8.18am) that he expects Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur to beat West Ham United on Saturday afternoon at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is preparing for his first game in charge of Spurs after replacing Mauricio Pochettino on Wednesday morning. he is thrown into a baptism of fire, by travelling the short distance to Stratford to take on the Hammers at the London Stadium.</p>
      <p>Spurs will be desperate to record just their fourth league win of the season, after managing just three victories in 12 league games. They come up against a Hammers side who have failed to pick up three points since beating Man United in September.</p>
      <p>Chelsea legend Zola, who was Maurizio Sarri’s assistant manager at Stamford Bridge last season, reckons Mourinho and Tottenham will have the edge at the London Stadium during Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off.</p>
      <p>“It’s a difficult game,” Zola said. “Playing against West Ham is never easy for anyone. If I have to give an advantage to either team, I think Spurs. West Ham have problems defending at the moment. If I have to give an edge, it should be to Tottenham.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s view – Where will Tottenham beat West Ham on Saturday?</h3>
      <p>It remains to be seen how Mourinho’s Tottenham will line-up – the Portuguese manager’s renowned defensive system, or a free-flowing attack that the Spurs players are used to. If they go for the latter, surely they will secure three points.</p>
      <p>West Ham have failed to keep a clean sheet in seven games, conceding 17 goals. Putting that leaky defence under pressure – that even conceded three goals to Newcastle – will surely see Spurs fire themselves to three points.</p>
