      <h1>Ben Mee still dreaming of maiden England call-up but admits it's up to Gareth Southgate</h1>
      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: Despite his consistency for Burnley, England has eluded him, prompting Sean Dyche to compare Mee to Steve Bruce</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:41:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:41</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>While England were securing their place at Euro 2020, Ben Mee was away on a sunshine break with his wife and young son.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/burnley-fc">Burnley</a> skipper Mee, international breaks are a chance to recharge his batteries, although he would dearly love to be pulling on the Three Lions shirt.</p>
      <p>Mee has seen current team-mates Nick Pope, James Tarkowski and Jack Cork called up by Southgate, along with former colleagues Tom Heaton and Michael Keane.</p>
      <p>But the call has so far eluded Mee, who responded wryly when asked if Pope – who made his first England start in Sunday's 4-0 win away to Kosovo – could put a word in for him with Southgate.</p>

      <p>“I tried to get Heats to do that, but it didn't work!” said Mee, able to laugh at his England plight, despite his obvious yearning to represent his country.</p>
      <p>Defender Mee, 30, who succeeded Heaton as skipper when the England keeper joined Aston Villa in the summer, has played every minute of Burnley's 12 Premier League games this season.</p>
      <p>Yet despite his consistency for the Clarets, England has eluded him, prompting Burnley boss Sean Dyche to compare Mee to Steve Bruce, as one of the country's best defenders never to earn a cap.</p>
      <p>“It was a big thing for the gaffer to say that, because Steve Bruce played for a top, top club who were winning titles,” said Mee.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to play for England, I wanted to do all that, to play in the Premier League. But I'm doing everything I can, so that's all I can do.</p>

      <p>“To be in that bracket, playing a lot of Premier League football and not getting a chance to play for England, I'm fine with it, to be honest with you.</p>
      <p>"I'm enjoying my football, and that's all you want to do, really.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he would regret ending his career having never played for England, Mee, who has 301 appearances for Burnley, said: “I don't think so, no.</p>
      <p>“I think if you look back on it and you think 'I didn't do enough' [then maybe].</p>
      <p>“But I feel like I'm playing well, I'm doing well and if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.</p>

      <p>“I want to do it, I've always wanted to do it, and I'd love to do it in the future, but it's up to the person in charge."</p>
      <p>Mee's immediate concern is helping Burnley climb the table.</p>
      <p>Dyche's side, who travel to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/watford-fc">Watford</a> on Saturday, have yet to win away this term, but have shown plenty of character on the road.</p>
      <p>"The performances haven't been bad, to be fair,” said Mee. “We've been to some tough places.</p>
      <p>“We got a last minute equaliser against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brighton-and-hove-albion-fc">Brighton</a> , recovered from two setbacks against Villa, we should have won at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> and we could have nicked something against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> .</p>

      <p>“The performances have been there, so it's not concerning. The Sheffield United game was a blip, losing 3-0, but performances away from home have generally been good, so the results will come.”</p>
      <p>Mee knows Burnley will find it hard to repeat their heroics of the 2017-18 season, when they finished seventh and qualified for the Europa League.</p>
      <p>Playing in Europe came at a cost to their domestic form, with a decent run towards the end of last season hauling them clear of the relegation scrap.</p>
      <p>This season, however, Dyche's side have no such concerns and are currently 10th, with a squad with the potential to climb higher and push for Europe.</p>

      <p>"It's an honour to captain this group,” said Mee. “We've got a good amount of players now who are reaching that peak stage of their career.</p>
      <p>“We feel like we're in a good place, training is always really good, it's sharp, and there's certainly a sense that we're hitting our peak.</p>
      <p>“Everyone is excited about where the club is going, it's grown massively in the past few years and it's good to be around a club that's doing that.”</p>
