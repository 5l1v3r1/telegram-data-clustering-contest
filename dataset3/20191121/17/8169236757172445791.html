        <b>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed his side’s Carabao Cup win over Arsenal is his favourite game of the season so far.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Reds looked to be heading for a heavy defeat at Anfield before a thrilling comeback late on took the match to a penalty shoot-out, which his side then won.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/21/liverpool-injury-news-blow-for-klopp-as-trio-expected-to-sit-out-vs-crystal-palace/">Liverpool injury news: Blow for Klopp as trio expected to sit out vs Crystal Palace</a></h3>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://theathletic.com/1384977/2019/11/21/jurgen-klopp-exclusive-when-we-start-a-team-meeting-the-only-thing-i-really-know-i-am-going-to-say-is-the-first-sentence/">The Athletic</a>, Klopp admits he doesn’t actually get that much enjoyment out of a lot of Liverpool’s games, though he felt that one was different.</p>
      <p>Liverpool fans have certainly been treated to a fair few exciting comebacks like that during the German tactician’s reign, and particularly so in the last few months.</p>
      <p>The Merseyside giants notably beat Barcelona 4-0 in last season’s Champions League semi-final second leg, when they’d gone into the game 3-0 down from the first game.</p>

      <p>This season, as well as their comeback against Arsenal, Liverpool also recently scored two goals in the final few minutes against Aston Villa to turn a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>Still, it seems that Arsenal game really stood out as Klopp praised the Anfield atmosphere that night.</p>
      <p>He said: “You know the best game of the season so far for me to enjoy? It was Arsenal in the Carabao Cup.</p>
      <p>“When we were 3-1 down I was thinking ‘come on, don’t give them a knock, don’t lose 4-1 or 5-1 as that wouldn’t be nice’. Then we started scoring again. That was my game to enjoy. I don’t have that a lot.</p>
      <p>“The boys made it a special night and I loved it. The atmosphere was brilliant and buzzing. We’ve had a lot of good moments at Anfield.”</p>
