      <p>The Portuguese tactician <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/english-premier-league/breaking-tottenham-hotspur-appoint-jose-mourinho/667797">replaced Mauricio Pochettino</a> at the 2018/19 UEFA Champions League finalists' helm on Wednesday morning.</p>
      <p>Despite his appointment being just over a day old, his new backroom staff has already been confirmed, with three members of his United team joining him in London, alongside two new members from LOSC Lille.</p>
      <p>He has named Joao Sacramento as his assistant manager, while Nuno Santos becomes the new goalkeeper coach. In addition, Mourinho also reappointed scout Ricardo Formosinho, analyst Giovanni Cerra and physical coach Carlos Lalin from their time together at the Red Devils.</p>

      <p>However, the new Spurs boss is also said to be keen on making changes to his squad, and could go up against his former club United in the upcoming January transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>Daily Express</i>, Mourinho is looking to sign Bruno Fernandes, who was heavily linked with a switch to Old Trafford in the most recent window.</p>
      <p>He has been a long-time admirer of the goalscoring midfielder, and praised him during his work as analyst.</p>
      <p>"I was surprised by the season of Bruno Fernandes," he told <i>Eleven Sports</i> ahead of the 2019/20 campaign.</p>
      <p>"It was easy to predict quality, he is a very good player, but scored a very high number of goals for a midfield player.</p>
      <p>"It shows that you need to have instinct and qualities to score, and he has it all.</p>
      <p>"He strikes the ball well, heads well, cool when he is one-on-one with the goalkeeper. He finds space in the penalty area. It's all there."</p>
