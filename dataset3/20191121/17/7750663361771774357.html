      <p>After suffering <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/result/result-ruthless-liverpool-overcome-man-city-at-anfield_378576.html">a 3-1 defeat to the Merseyside giants</a> before the international break, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/pep-guardiola/"><b>Pep Guardiola</b></a> will acknowledge that his team cannot afford a fourth setback at this stage of the campaign.</p>
      <p>As for Chelsea, six successive victories for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/frank-lampard/"><b>Frank Lampard</b></a>'s team have moved the Blues one point ahead of the defending champions in the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/premier-league/table.html">top-flight standings</a>.</p>
      <p>Here, <b>Sports Mole</b> selects its strongest combined XI from both squads, using only players available for this weekend's encounter.</p>

      <p>With <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ederson/"><b>Ederson</b></a> having seemingly recovered from a muscle injury and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kepa-arrizabalaga/"><b>Kepa Arrizabalaga</b></a> having remained inconsistent during his second year at Stamford Bridge, it is only logical that we select the Brazilian stopper between the sticks.</p>
      <p>While the full-back positions throw up a tougher choice, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kyle-walker/"><b>Kyle Walker</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/emerson-palmieri/"><b>Emerson Palmieri</b></a> have produced the better all-round performances on the right and left respectively, resulting in <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/cesar-azpilicueta/"><b>Cesar Azpilicueta</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/benjamin-mendy/"><b>Benjamin Mendy</b></a> missing out on a place in this team.</p>
      <p>Having returned from injury, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/john-stones/"><b>John Stones</b></a> is our first choice in the centre of the backline, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kurt-zouma/"><b>Kurt Zouma</b></a>'s greater experience and physical presence earning him a spot in the side over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fikayo-tomori/"><b>Fikayo Tomori</b></a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jorginho/"><b>Jorginho</b></a> has been a revelation for Chelsea this season and gets the nod over <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rodri/"><b>Rodri</b></a>, although there is no place for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ngolo-kante/"><b>N'Golo Kante</b></a>, largely due to his lack of match sharpness.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ilkay-gundogan/"><b>Ilkay Gundogan</b></a> has been preferred to the World Cup winner, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kevin-de-bruyne/"><b>Kevin De Bruyne</b></a> the first name on our teamsheet on the right-hand side of a midfield three.</p>
      <p>The selection of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/raheem-sterling/"><b>Raheem Sterling</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sergio-aguero/"><b>Sergio Aguero</b></a> is also a no-brainer, leaving a solitary role vacant in one of the wide positions.</p>
      <p>As a result of his recent goal glut, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/christian-pulisic/"><b>Christian Pulisic</b></a> is selected over the likes of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/willian/"><b>Willian</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/callum-hudson-odoi/"><b>Callum Hudson-Odoi</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/riyad-mahrez/"><b>Riyad Mahrez</b></a>.</p>
