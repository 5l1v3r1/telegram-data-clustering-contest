        <b>Valve’s “flagship VR game,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> was something of a surprise when it was leaked and then subsequently <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/half-life-alyx">announced</a> a few days ago. Now, developer Valve has fully revealed the PC game. The short version is that it’s a feature-length VR title set to launch early next year, and as the rumours suggested, it is indeed a prequel to the events of Half-Life 2.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx is set to launch March 2020 for $59.99 USD. It will be free for owners of the Valve Index, but will be compatible with all PC VR headsets. It’s a “full-length virtual reality entry in the Half-Life series,” set between Half-Life and Half-Life 2, and it’s built in the Source 2 engine. You will play as Alyx Vance, and work alongside Eli to build the resistance against combine forces.</p>
      <p>Valve says the title “was designed from the ground up for virtual reality and features all of the hallmarks of a classic Half-Life game: world exploration, puzzle solving, visceral combat, and an intricately woven story that connects it all with the characters iconic to the Half-Life universe.”</p>
      <p>“Everyone at Valve is excited to be returning to the world of Half-Life,” Valve founder Gabe Newell says in a press release. “VR has energized us. We’ve invested a lot of ourselves in the technology. But we’re also game developers at heart, and to be devoting ourselves to a VR game this ambitious is just as exciting. For that to come in the form of Half-Life feels like the culmination of a lot things we care a lot about: truly great games, cutting edge technology, and open platforms. We can’t wait for people to experience this.”</p>
      <p>Here’s the announcement trailer:</p>

      <p>The Half-Life series has been dormant since Half-Life 2: Episode 2 launched in 2007, while the last full game in the series was the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2, which was released in 2004.

      <p>More recently, Valve has shown a willingness to keep its old properties ticking over. <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/portal-2/update">Portal 2 recently received an update</a>, eight years after it came out, for example. On the other hand, the company says “<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/team-fortress-2/update">hardly anyone</a>” is working on Team Fortress 2 anymore.</p>
