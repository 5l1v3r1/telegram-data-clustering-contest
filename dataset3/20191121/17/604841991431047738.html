      <p>Men’s health charity, Movember Ireland has teamed up with ten of Ireland’s most prolific street artists to host an exclusive art auction at The Hendrick Hotel, Smithfield. Curated by James Earley, some of Ireland’s most notable street artists including Maser, Aches, Joe Caslin and Duda will create a one-off piece inspired by, and aimed at nurturing, open conversations surrounding men’s mental health.<br/>Original pieces of artwork will be auctioned on the night to raise much needed funds to benefit ground-breaking men’s health initiatives. This first of its kind auction is taking place on the November 29th in the newly opened Hendrick Hotel. A gallery, the hotel is adorned with pieces by leading Irish and international street artists, including a section of the iconic Windmill Lane walls that were salvaged by Movember before redevelopment of area in 2015. <br/>Throughout the years, artists have used their work to help the Movember Foundation connect with hard-to-reach audiences and bring often ignores subjects surrounding men’s health into the public consciousness.</p>

      <p>“The aim of this project is to bring a splash of colour to a topic which typically can be a challenge for men to open up about” says Dublin-based artist James Earley. “Art can be interpreted in different ways and working with some of Ireland’s finest street artists allows us to use art as a medium to bring the topic of mental health to the surface which hopefully Irish men can relate to.” <br/>Neil Rooney, Global Innovations Manager for Movember said: "Art is a great way for us to bring our message to the forefront and we are delighted to be working with such an outstanding line-up of Irish artists to help us breach the stigmas surrounding men’s health. We are on a mission to change the behaviour of Irish men and take positive action to look after their physical and mental wellbeing, and we are truly grateful for the support from each of the artist’s involved in this project.’<br/>Now in its 11th year, Movember is the biggest funder of prostate cancer initiatives in Ireland. More than 100,000 Irish people have joined the movement, funding over 30 Irish programmes in that time. To donate to the charity, visit movember.com</p>

        <b>Grow A Mo, Save A Bro!<br/>Help change the face of men’s health from 1st – 30th November</b>
      </p>
      <p>Earley, in partnership with leading men’s health charity Movember, has created an animated piece of artwork titled ‘Leading the Good Fight; Transparent Conversations’. The outdoor piece, which adorns Coppinger Row in Dublin’s City Centre, provides a direct and effective message – men’s mental health is at a crisis point and as a nation, we need to remove stigmas associated with mental health, encourage men to stay connected and to talk with someone they trust, especially when things get tough.</p>
      <p>The instillation of the piece marks the launch of Movember 2019, the annual month-long fundraiser which kicks off on Friday, November 1st. Going beyond raising awareness around men’s health issues, the project aims to be a catalyst for conversations that matter, creating positive outcomes to the lives of those effected by poor mental health. Globally, every minute a man dies by suicide. On average, 8 out of 10 suicides in Ireland are by men, with the highest rate among 45-54-year olds.<br/> <br/> </p>

      <p> <br/>Bringing those statistics to the forefront, James Earley depicts a deconstructed stained-glass window re-building itself using transparent, abstracted forms of coloured glass, weaved around typographic forms, bonding themselves together with black lead lines. James is one of Ireland’s best-known artists: his Blooms Hotel project is the largest public artwork in Ireland to date and he has also travelled extensively with his art throughout Europe, the United States and Asia. <br/> <br/>Speaking about the piece – painted in his distinctive style which celebrates and pays homage to his family's rich artistic past within Irish stained-glass art - James said ‘men need to take better care of their mental health and typically, we're not great at opening up about our feelings. Mental health is an issue close to my heart, teaming up with Movember helps to create awareness and amplify that message.’<br/> <br/>Neil Rooney, Global Innovations Manager for Movember, added ‘we are humbled to partner with James on this project. By harnessing the visual and social power of urban art, as well as its ability to tackle subjects that are often ignored by society, James has produced a piece that not only creates awareness of men’s health issues but also becomes a catalyst for conversations that can literally save lives’. </p>
