      <h1>Pushing! Shoving! Chaos erupts at Bellator London media day (Video)</h1>

      <p>When I heard there was a huge scuffle at the Bellator London media day, I thought for sure Michael Page was somehow involved, as “Venom” has a way of <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/7/23/20707117/video-michael-page-blows-gasket-two-hands-richard-kiely-bellator-dublin-presser">getting under the skin of his opponents</a>, in this case late-replacement Giovanni Melillo.</p>
      <p>Turns out, the two combatants who needed to be separated, James Gallagher and Mike Kimbel, aren’t even fighting at the Bellator event this Sat. night (Nov. 23, 2019) inside SSE Arena in London, England.</p>
      <p>Apparently there was some back-and-forth jawing on social media that led to the usual bro-threats about asses getting kicked and all sorts of other drama. The logical next step would be to have them square off inside the cage; however, Gallagher is booked to fight Cal Ellenor on Feb. 22 in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
      <p>Another angle:</p>

      <p>Gallagher (10-1) has captured three straight, including last September’s submission win over Roman Salazar. The unbooked Kimbel (3-2), meanwhile, has fought exclusively for Bellator and was recently finished by Chris Disonell back in August.</p>
