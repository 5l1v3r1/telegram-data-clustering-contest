      <p>Neal Ardley believes Aldershot's 6-1 mauling at the hands of Dagenham will make them a "dangerous side" when Notts County face the National League strugglers this weekend.</p>
      <p>Shots boss Damon Searle is hoping for a response from his players after their hammering at Peter Taylor's side last weekend as he blasted their performance as a "disgrace".</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Ardley</a> says both   teams are going into the fixture as "wounded animals" with the Magpies keen to issue their own come back from a 3-0 defeat at home to Barrow last weekend.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> boss is unsure of what to expect from the Shots, but is adamant that his side will be have to be on top form if they are to pick up a result.</p>

      <p>“They’ll make sure their performance levels are a lot higher this week and that makes them a dangerous side,” he said.</p>
      <p>“They’re a team who mix up their shape, and their last result makes it hard to know what to expect because they might change things.</p>
      <p>“That’s where our scenario training comes in – that helps us to try and cope with it all.</p>
      <p>“We’ll have to go there and do a lot well to earn the right to win.”</p>
