      <p>“The greatest show ever in the history of entertainment is returning!” (And no, we’re not talking about the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/kelsey-grammer-says-frasier-reboot-will-happen-in-2020.html"><i>Frasier</i></a><i> </i>reboot. We’re talking about an equal-and-opposite reaction to the <i>Frasier </i>reboot<i>.</i>) On February 3, Desus Nice and the Kid Mero will be back on late night for season two of <i>Desus &amp; Mero </i>on Showtime. (If you count the two Viceland seasons, this will be their fourth. Not bad for humble <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/02/desus-and-mero-beginners-guide.html">podcast beginnings</a>.) Mero <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/desus-and-mero-love-doing-late-night-comedy-with-showtime.html">told Vulture</a><i> </i>earlier this year that the comedy pair loves working with Showtime because back at Viceland “we were used to working in a conference room with a dead bear,” with Desus adding, “We went to Showtime and they wanted a lot more soft-core pornography, ‘cause that’s usually what they run at 11.” The new season will air twice a week in the aforementioned soft-core slot on Mondays and Thursdays. Tonight’s the season-one finale with guests Chadwick Boseman and Elizabeth Warren, if you want to tune in to see how Liz celebrates the renewal news. Showtime’s Standards and Practices guy must be “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/matt-walsh-is-desus-and-meros-standards-and-practices-guy.html">smokin’ jazzed</a>” about this!</p>
