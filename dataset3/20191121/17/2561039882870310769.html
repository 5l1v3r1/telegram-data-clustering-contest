      <p>Adobe has shared a timeline of new features coming to Photoshop for iPad.<br/><br/><i>Your experience, your feedback and your point of view has always been a critical part of our process, and we take that very seriously as we chart a path forward with the iPad. That’s why today, we’re excited to share how we think about the future, and give you a glimpse into what’s to come and how your input is reflected in our planning process.</i><br/><br/>Here's a look at the upcoming features...<br/><br/><b>Coming to Photoshop on the iPad in 2019:</b><br/>● <b>Select Subject </b><br/>Select Subject uses the Adobe Sensei AI machine learning technology to enable you to automatically select the subject of an image to speed up complex selections. We gave you a sneak peek of this feature on the iPad as part of the Adobe MAX keynote presentation a few weeks ago. There is no other iPad app on the market with this type of powerful yet easy to use selection capability.</p>

      <p>● <b>Cloud documents</b><br/>Cloud documents will become faster than ever before. The new cloud documents system saves your documents between Photoshop on the iPad and desktop to make working across devices seamless. The Photoshop cloud document format is optimized to save only the incremental changes made to the PSD, making it the fastest way to work across all your devices with Photoshop. For example, if you change just one pixel, only that pixel syncs to the cloud. In December we will begin the rollout of system optimizations that deliver even swifter upload and download of cloud documents than what’s in the app today.<br/><br/><b>Coming on the first half of 2020:</b><br/>Selections in Photoshop on the iPad will become incredible with the addition of rich and deep selection capabilities only available in Photoshop.<br/><br/>● <b>Refine Edge</b><br/>The Refine Edge brush is one of the most important selection tools in Photoshop. It is used to make complex, soft edge selections on challenging subjects like hair and fur, or to perfect selections of objects that intermix both soft and hard edges, and many other tricky selection operations. We are thrilled to bring it to the iPad in the coming year.</p>

      <p>● <b>Curves and Adjustment Layer Options</b><br/>We will further deepen the app’s retouching capabilities by adding Curves for tonal adjustments and continue to build out adjustment layers to enhance non-destructive workflows. For example, within Levels we’ll add things like adjust by color range and more.<br/><br/>● <b>Brush sensitivity and Rotate Canvas</b><br/>We know you have been enjoying the amazing brush sensitivity in the new Adobe Fresco app (which I also encourage you to download here if you have not). And of course you want to rotate the canvas to perfectly position it for any angle. We will continuously bring unique touch and mobile optimizations like these to Photoshop on the iPad.<br/><br/>● <b>Lightroom Integration</b><br/>Images are the foundation to virtually any composite and we are very excited to work with the Lightroom team to begin to deliver integration of Lightroom and Photoshop workflows on the iPad. With these new capabilities, you will be able to process raw images in Lightroom premium on your iPad and take them further in Photoshop using workflows designed specifically for this device.<br/><br/>You can download Adobe Photoshop from the App Store for free.<br/><br/><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-photoshop/id1457771281?at=11l655">Download</a></p>
