      <h1>West Ham predicted team vs Tottenham: Roberto starts in Mourinho's first Spurs match</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers take on their bitter rivals on Saturday as two under pressure managers square off in east London</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:15:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:15</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham face Spurs at London Stadium on Saturday lunchtime with the Hammers winless in their last six top flight games while Spurs haven't won away from home since January in the league and, like the Hammers, have just three victories in 12 this season so far.</p>
      <p>However, Spurs have acted on their poor form so far by firing Mauricio Pochettino earlier this week and acting swiftly to replace him with Jose Mourinho on a three-year contract. The Portuguese boss will be in the dugout for the game this weekend.</p>
      <p>Manuel Pellegrini hasn't seen his team pick up a victory since beating Manchester United on September 22 and has watched his team plummet from fifth in the table to 16th in between the previous two international breaks.</p>
      <p>His job isn't in any immediate danger but he needs to turn around the results drastically and get his players back on form after some extremely disappointing displays in their last six games.</p>
      <p>The Hammers boss suffered an injury blow prior to the break as Manuel Lanzini underwent surgery on a fractured collarbone which could rule him out for the rest of 2019. On the flip side, Michail Antonio is back in training and is fit for this weekend though his inclusion from the start is rated at 50/50. Likewise Noble, who has recovered from a twisted ankle sustained against Burnley.</p>
      <p>But that hasn't stopped us predicting a team for the weekend and here it is:</p>

        <figcaption>Our predicted team for the game on Saturday</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Our team shows one change from the disappointing 3-0 defeat to Burnley last time out as we have brought back Andriy Yarmolenko for Pablo Fornals in the midfield.</p>
      <p>The big news in our team is that gaffe-prone Roberto keeps his place in goal ahead of David Martin. It's more out of necessity than choice as the manager is unlikely to throw his third-string stopper into the fray despite Roberto's severe struggles since replacing Lukasz Fabianski.</p>
      <p>The back four remains unchanged as Fabian Balbuena kept a morale boosting clean sheet for Paraguay during the international break and keeps his place alongside Issa Diop, who is one booking away from a one-match ban.</p>
      <p>In midfield, a lot depends on the fitness of Mark Noble, who picked up an ankle sprain in the Burnley game. Should he not make it then it's not really clear who could come in though Pablo Fornals might, pushing Snodgrass into a more central role and Fornals playing in the ten.</p>
      <p>Up front, Sebastien Haller should lead the line looking to score just his second goal since August and end a lean spell in front of goal, supported by Yarmolenko and Felipe Anderson on the wings. Antonio is likely to start on the bench if he has recovered fully from his torn hamstring that has kept him out of action since August.</p>
