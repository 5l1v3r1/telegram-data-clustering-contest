      <p>A classic walnut cake is always a welcome treat as an afternoon snack with a cup of tea, or as a delicious dessert. Serve with some crème fraîche or cream. </p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 25 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>1 hour 30 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>8 to 10</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>butter, for greasing</li>
        <li>300g walnuts, plus extra to decorate</li>
        <li>10 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>300g caster sugar, plus extra to finish</li>
        <li>the zest of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>100g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>crème fraîche or cream, to serve</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 160C/140C fan/Gas 3. Grease and line the base and sides of a 30cm round cake tin.</li>
        <li>Blitz the walnuts in a food processor to a crumb-like texture. Beat the egg whites in a bowl until stiff peaks form. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the yolks and sugar until the mixture is pale and creamy. Fold the egg whites very gently into the yolk and sugar mixture using a large metal spoon, taking care to incorporate them without overworking it.</li>
        <li>Stir in the lemon zest, then fold in the flour and baking power. Finally, fold in the walnuts.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the lined tin and bake for 1-1½ hours, until a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn out on to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with a little caster sugar and serve with extra walnuts and crème fraîche or cream.</li>
      </ol>
