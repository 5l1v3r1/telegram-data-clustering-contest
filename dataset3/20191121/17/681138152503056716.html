      <p>Best-before date: 31 March 2020</p>
      <p>If you have bought this product and have an allergy to nuts, do not eat it. Instead return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund or contact the Mondelez consumer care line on 0800 818181.</p>

      <p>The Food Standards Agency are also urgently recalling <b>various brands and flavours of houmous </b>as they may contain salmonella.</p>
      <p>These include a number of <b>Aldi, Asda, Lidl, Morrisons, Nando's, Sainsbury's and Iceland brands. </b><a href="https://www.tradingstandards.uk/consumers/product-recalls-and-safety-notices">The full details can be found here.<br/></a>The products listed may contain salmonella, with symptoms including fever, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. If you have bought any of the houmous items listed you are advised not to eat them and instead return them to the store where they were bought for a full refund.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Harvey Nichols</b> are also recalling some of their <b>Dark Chocolate Gingers </b>due to three instances where pistachio nuts have been found.</p>

      <p>The box with the bow is being recalled, with the style code 766240, batch code 190916 and a best-before date of August 30, 2020.</p>
      <p>If you have bought this product and you have an allergy to pistachio nuts do not eat them or pass on as a gift to another party. Instead you should check your product and return it to store for a full refund.</p>
      <p>Anyone sleeping on one of<b> Argos'</b> <b>memory foam mattress toppers</b> should check their beds immediately as a number of toppers do not conform to UK fire safety standards.</p>

      <p>The batch codes of the unsafe memory foam mattress toppers can be <a href="https://www.tradingstandards.uk/consumers/product-recalls-and-safety-notices">found here.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></a>A popular <b>children's swing set by Kingsport </b>is also being recalled as it poses a risk of strangulation.</p>
      <p>The product is incorrectly labelled as being suitable for small children as the crotch strap can break and the seat back and bottom may come apart, causing the small child to slip down and become trapped by the neck where the two shoulder straps meet, leading to strangulation.</p>
      <p>Therefore the product does not comply with the requirements of the Toy Safety Directive.</p>
