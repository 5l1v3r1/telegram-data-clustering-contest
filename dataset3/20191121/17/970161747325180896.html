      <p>Stacey Jones wanted to create an incredible bedroom for her three-year-old – but she was on a tight budget.</p>
      <p>With a little imagination, she managed to turn his plain, boring room into a creative dinosaur-themed zone for Huey.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-three painted her own designs instead of using wallpaper and upcycled furniture to create the look.</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old visual stylist from Manchester told money-saving website <a href="https://www.latestdeals.co.uk/">LatestDeals.co.uk</a>: ‘I really wanted to create a unique and fun room for my dinosaur-mad little boy, but my budget was small for this makeover so I had to get creative and think outside of the box.</p>
      <p>‘His bedroom is only small so painting mountains on the wall instead of using wallpaper kept the cost low and the room feeling light even though I’ve used green tones which could easily have made the room feel smaller.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘I wanted a lot of natural tones and fabrics to compliment so the use of jute and wicker and the natural pine bed really stands out against the green. Foliage and lights were added to the teepee bed and the dino feet stickers on the floor add to the dino jungle theme.</p>

      <p>‘All the DIY was done by myself including the upcycle of the Ikea chest of drawers; I painted those in the same shades as the mountains on the wall and added plastic toy dinosaurs as the handles: in total that cost around £35.</p>
      <p>‘It roughly cost £280 in total to do the makeover.’</p>

      <p>Stacey, who is also mum to Honey, 13, Harmoni, 11, sought out decorations from budget stores, finding a large T-Rex head for the wall for £6.99, themed bedding from Primark for £9 and a dinosaur cuddly toy from Argos for £2.25.</p>

      <p>She added: ‘My tips would be to use the same paint used on the walls to upcycle the drawers to keep costs low, and also to keep everything matching.</p>

      <p>‘Don’t buy expensive drawer handles – I’d seen dinosaur ones for around £30 to £40 and I managed to make my own for £6. Source cheap artificial plants that you can cut up and use as the foliage on the bed frame as it works out much cheaper than buying the longs strands of faux ivy and so on.’</p>

      <p>‘I feel so proud of what I managed to achieve on a small budget and best of all I got the seal of approval from Huey who tells me he loves his dinosaur bedroom every day.’</p>
