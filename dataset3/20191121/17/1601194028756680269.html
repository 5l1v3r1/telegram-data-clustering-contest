      <p>Virat Kohli has insisted India were correct to hold off on playing a day-night Test until they were confident the conditions were right.</p>
      <p>India turned down the opportunity to play a day-night match against Australia in Adelaide in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, the world's leading Test side will play across the afternoon and evening for the first time when they take on Bangladesh in Kolkata on Friday.</p>
      <p>It is the second match of a two-game series, with India having cruised to victory by an innings and 130 runs in the opening Test.</p>
      <p>Captain Kohli had been reluctant to test the waters for a day-night Test, but believes India have made the correct decision in biding their time to play in the altered format.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we wanted to get a feel of pink-ball cricket. Eventually, it had to happen," Kohli, whose side are facing a Bangladesh team that has lost its last four Tests, told a news conference.</p>
      <p>"But, you can't bring up those things before a big tour that you're going to and suddenly in the schedule, there's a pink-ball Test, when we haven't even practiced with the pink ball â€“ we haven't played any first-class games with pink ball.</p>
      <p>"The thing was to experience the pink-ball Test in our own conditions first, so you get the hang of how the ball behaves, what is the way to sight the ball and so on.</p>
      <p>"Then, eventually, going and playing with the pink ball anywhere in the world. So it can't be a sudden thing.</p>
      <p>"It needed a bit of preparation. Once you get a hang of it, once you're used to playing it, there's no problem in playing at all."</p>

      <p>Kohli, though, does not feel day-night matches will become the norm in Test cricket.</p>
      <p>"I don't think [it will be] in five-six years," he said.</p>
      <p>"In my opinion, this should not become the only way Test cricket is played because then you're losing that nervousness in the first session in the morning.</p>
      <p>"Yes, you can bring excitement into Test cricket but you can't purely make Test cricket based on just entertaining people."</p>
