      <p>The district-level committee for captive elephant management, chaired by District Collector P.B. Noohu, has decided to strictly enforce the regulations for parading captive elephants between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>The committee has decided not to permit parading of elephants without obtaining prior permission for the same.</p>
      <p>At present, 107 temples in the district have got permission for parading elephants. The temple authorities should submit application for conducting the festival to the monitoring committee three days before the festival.</p>
      <p>The festival committee and public should not permit people to take selfie with elephants or sound horn near the elephants.</p>
      <p>The Collector sought the cooperation of all concerned for strict implementation of the captive elephant maintenance rules.</p>
