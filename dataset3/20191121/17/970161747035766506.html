      <p>Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted for bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</p>
      <p>The Israeli prime minister has been charged in a series of corruption scandals which included accepting hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of champagne and cigars from billionaire friends in return for favours.</p>
      <p>He also allegedly used his influence to help a wealthy telecoms magnate in exchange for favourable coverage on a popular news site.</p>
      <p>Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit issued the indictment today.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he is a victim of a witch-hunt.</p>
      <p>He is due to make a statement tonight.</p>

      <p>However, the decision to charge him is likely to deal a heavy blow to his hopes of remaining in office.</p>
      <p>Israel has recently held two inconclusive elections, with a third likely amid an ongoing political impasse.</p>

      <p>It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has been charged with a crime.</p>
      <p>The indictment does not require Mr Netanyahu to resign but is expected to raise pressure on him to step down.</p>
      <p>The most serious charges are connected to so-called ‘Case 4000’, in which Mr Netanyahu is accused of passing regulations that gave his friend, telecoms magnate Shaul Elovitch, benefits worth tens of millions to his company Bezeq.</p>
      <p>In return, Bezeq’s news site Walla allegedly published favourable articles about the PM and his family.</p>
      <p>The indictment also said Mr Netanyahu’s gifts of champagne from billionaires Arnon Milchan and James Packer ‘turned into a sort of supply line’.</p>
      <p>And it accuses Mr Netanyahu of assisting Israeli Mr Milchan, a Hollywood mogul, in extending his US visa.</p>
      <p>Two close aides to Mr Netanyahu testified against him in the case.</p>
