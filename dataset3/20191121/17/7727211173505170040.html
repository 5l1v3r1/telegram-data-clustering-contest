      <h1>Court Hey Park gets CCTV to combat vandalism menace after arson attack</h1>
      <h2>Court Hey Park has been subject to continued vandalism for two years, including an arson attack in October</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:40:50+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/christopher-mckeon/" target="_blank">Christopher McKeon</a></address>
      <p>A Merseyside park plagued by vandalism and anti-social behaviour is getting a cash injection to boost security measures.</p>
      <p>Court Hey Park has been targeted by vandals since the National Wildflower Centre closed down in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Most recently, a garden operated by community group <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/yobs-keep-trashing-community-garden-17167278">Incredible Edible Knowsley</a> was trashed and part of the site set fire to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/pictures-show-heartbreaking-scene-after-17128189">in an arson attack in late October.</a></p>
      <p>The arson attack left volunteers “scared” to repair the damage in case it happened again, according to the group’s director Karen Mower.</p>
      <p>Following the latest incident, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley-council">Knowsley Council’s</a> cabinet has now approved a bid for £19,000 from the Friends of Court Hey Park to provide additional protection against anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>Among the new additions to the site will be a CCTV system monitored by the council’s security team, measures to make it harder for people to gain unauthorised access to the park and work to “open up sight lines around the site”.</p>
      <p>The money will also contribute to diversionary activities for children and young people, who are believed to have carried out most of the criminal damage at the park.</p>
      <p>The funding for Court Hey Park will come from Knowsley Council’s community fund and was one of several payments to community groups authorised by the cabinet on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Other payments included £20,000 to help educate young people about keeping safe from gangs, £20,000 to encourage waste prevention, £12,000 to support Healthwatch Knowsley’s older people’s strategy and £3,000 to boost security at the Liverpool Ganesh Temple in Kirkby.</p>
