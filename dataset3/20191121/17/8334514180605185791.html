      <p>(Reuters) - Shares of marijuana companies rose on Thursday after a U.S. congressional committee passed a legislation to decriminalize cannabis, taking it a step closer to being approved by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.</p>

      <p>The bill, which was passed 24 to 10 in the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday, sent shares of Canopy Growth (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/WEED.TO">WEED.TO</a>), Aurora Cannabis (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/ACB.TO">ACB.TO</a>), Aphria Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/APHA.TO">APHA.TO</a>) and Tilray Inc (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TLRY.O">TLRY.O</a>) up between 8% and 15%.</p>
      <p>“We think federal legalization would be a big positive for investor sentiment surrounding cannabis equities, which have been battered by oversupply and a steep price decline for the underlying commodity since becoming legal in Canada,” said Garrett Nelson, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research.</p>
      <p>The approval comes two months after the House passed a bill to advance legislation that would allow banks to provide services to cannabis companies in states where it is legal.</p>
      <p>The latest bill, which has more than 50 co-sponsors, enables states to set their own policies while allowing to expunge federal marijuana convictions and arrests.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the bill will authorize a 5% federal sales tax on marijuana products that are manufactured in or imported into the United States.</p>
      <p>However, analysts were skeptical about the future of the bill.</p>
      <p>“It’s such an early step in a long process that there are no near-term implications for cannabis stocks. The Senate isn’t likely to approve it, even if the House were to do so,” said Alan Brochstein, managing partner at New Cannabis Ventures.</p>
      <p>Shares in the sector are down more than 25% this year, according to the alternative harvest ETF (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/MJ.P">MJ.P</a>), which tracks cannabis-related stocks, taking a blow from a slow roll out of retail stores and oversupply in Canada, as well as uncertainties related to U.S. regulations.</p>
      <p>Weed companies have been spending heavily to expand and strike partnerships in the United States, banking on more states legalizing cannabis for both recreational and medical use.</p>
      <p>Currently, 11 U.S. states have legalized marijuana for recreational use, while 33 states have approved it for medical purposes.</p>
