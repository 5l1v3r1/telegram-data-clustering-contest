      <h2>Liverpool received a welcome boost ahead of their Crystal Palace clash on Saturday with Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson both featuring in training</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:28:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have been handed a boost ahead of their clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> this weekend after Mohamed Salah was pictured in training with his team-mates.</p>
      <p>Salah has been struggling with an ankle injury since their win over <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> on October 5 and aggravated the problem against <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> before the international break.</p>
      <p>A report from Sky Sports News claimed Salah and left-back Andy Robertson would be ruled out of Saturday's game at Anfield.</p>
      <p>But Salah provided hope that may not be the case as he was pictured at Melwood being put through his paces alongside his team-mates.</p>
      <p>However, it is understood he did not take part in full training, instead doing the pre-contact section of the session, with Klopp set to see if they can return to full training on Friday before making a decision ahead of the weekend.</p>

      <p>Jordan Henderson was also spotted after shaking off a viral infection which saw him miss England's trip to Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Salah was pictured wearing a protective boot before pulling out of international duty with Egypt, whilst Jurgen Klopp gave an update on his ankle after the Manchester City win.</p>

      <p>Klopp said: “I think it is more really annoying - for him, not me - the fact that the injury always has a bit of fluid in, and he has to deal with it, we get it out and it comes back, and stuff like that."</p>
      <p>Robertson was also seen walking out to the training field with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.</p>

      <p>But, like Salah, he was limited to the non-contact part of the session.</p>
      <p>After missing Scotland's Euro 2020 qualifiers against Cyprus and Kazakhstan, Robertson said: “I don’t care what game it is, I want to play it and my track record in the last five years has shown that.</p>

        <figcaption>Liverpool's other injury concern, Andy Robertson, was also spotted on the pitch<cite>(Image: Liverpool FC via Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>

      <p>"But I don’t want to pick up more injuries and ruin my season because of it.</p>
      <p>"I’ve had to listen to the people around me when previously I would have told them to beat it. The fact my ankle has swollen up again has made it easier to miss these games.</p>
      <p>"For the last two and a half weeks I’ve not trained at all for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> . I’ve trained the day before a game, missed a Champions League game other than the last 15 minutes against Genk and missed <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> in the League Cup.”</p>
