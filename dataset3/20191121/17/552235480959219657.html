      <h1>Jack Ross outlines Hibs transfer plans as new manager targets 'fine margins' of improvement</h1>
      <h2>The former Sunderland boss faces Motherwell on Saturday in his first game.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:34:17+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:34</time> by <a rel="author">Gabriel McKay</a></address>
      <p>New Hibs manager <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> insists he's not planning to revolutionise the squad in January, as he looks to get the most from the players he currently has.</p>
      <p>The former Sunderland manager has replaced Paul Heckingbottom in the dugout, and faces <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/motherwell-fc">Motherwell</a> on Saturday for his first game as Hibees boss.</p>
      <p>Given <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> have won just two games all season, many would expect there to be a raft of changes in January. But Ross is adamant he'd prefer to work with that he's got.</p>
      <p>He said: "My assessment of the squad is only just beginning.</p>

      <p>"Ideally, I'd like to not have to do much in January because that would mean between now and the winter break we would have picked up a lot of points. That's the perfect scenario.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has different approaches but for me it's not about sitting here having that threat over the players that I'm going to bring players in in January.</p>
      <p>"I want to start enjoying working with what I have here. The ideal scenario is that if they are that good I don't have to bring in anyone in come January.</p>
      <p>"Speaking to people before I came here about this team this season, there was a lot of talk about fine margins and that the team should be more points better off.</p>

      <p>"Those fine margins would mean there is not an awful lot wrong.</p>
      <p>"For me it's not about looking back. I could only affect things as of Tuesday when I started to work with the players so that's what the focus is on.</p>
      <p>"I've stressed to the players that any changes we make will be gradual.</p>
      <p>"The biggest changes we make this week may be on the training pitch.</p>
      <p>"But I've not asked what <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/paul-heckingbottom">Paul</a> did as I think he's a very good coach and manager but all coaches and managers work in their own way. Slowly but surely we'll drip in our ideas.</p>
      <p>"This week has been more about me trying to learn as much about Motherwell in a short period of time as I haven't seen much of them for the last 18 months.</p>
      <p>"But it will be a good test as right now Motherwell are in a position in the league that we are aspiring to."</p>
