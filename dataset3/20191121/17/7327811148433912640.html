      <p>GLEN RIDGE, New Jersey (WABC) -- A red fox that <a href="https://abc7ny.com/pets-animals/police-kill-fox-after-it-attacks-5-people-in-new-jersey-town/5707474/">attacked five people in a northern New Jersey community</a> and also tried to attack a police officer has tested positive for rabies, officials confirmed Thursday.</p>
      <p>Glen Ridge police say the first attack was reported around 9:15 a.m. Friday, and as officers from that department and the Bloomfield Animal Control agency searched for the animal, authorities learned that two other people had also been bitten.</p>
      <p>Officers found the fox about two hours later near the New Jersey Transit railroad tracks, where authorities say it was euthanized after it attempted to attack one of the officers.</p>
      <p>The two other people attacked by the fox apparently were not bitten.</p>
      <p>The Glen Ridge health and police departments are now advising anyone who had direct contact with a red fox around November 14 and November 15 to seek immediate medical attention and to call the health department at 973-680-4024 for any needed guidance.</p>
      <p>Rabies is a deadly disease that with prompt treatment is 100 percent controllable but without prompt treatment becomes a fatal disease.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is imperative to obtain prompt treatment following a bite or exposure to the saliva of an infected animal.</p>
      <p>If a pet is known to have had contact with a red fox around the same time frame, its owner is urged to contact a veterinarian to discuss proper treatment.</p>
      <p>Residents are also advised that other wildlife could have been exposed to this fox and could also develop rabies, including raccoons, skunks and feral cats.</p>
      <p>Should there be an immediate concern about an animal exhibiting abnormal behavior, contact the Glen Ridge Police Department.</p>
      <p>In addition to keeping pets current on rabies vaccination, residents are urged to:<br/>--Avoid contact with wild animals<br/>--Do not feed wild animals or stray cats and dogs<br/>--Eliminate outdoor food sources around the home<br/>--Keep pets confined to your property or walk them on a leash</p>
      <p>Any concerns for wildlife population control and behavior questions may be directed to NJS Fish &amp; Game Wildlife Control at 908-735-8793.</p>
