      <p>Southampton goth-punks <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/creeper/">Creeper</a> have dropped a new video for Born Cold, the first new music since <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/creeper-have-announced-their-return/">their surprise comeback last month</a>.</p>
      <p>It’s the first new music from the enigmatic six-piece since 2017’s debut album Eternity, In Your Arms. And as you might expect, the storyline and mythology surrounding the band is expanding even further.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“The video reveals the world and themes of the new album for the first time,” says frontman Will Gould. “It also introduces fans to the first of the new characters in the Creeper universe; Roe, a man from another world.”</p>
      <p>Speaking previously about the song, Will said: “This song is the introduction of one of the more villainous characters from our new story. It was inspired by what the Thin White Duke was for David Bowie – a more selfish, narcissistic character.”</p>

      <p>Discussing the creation of their upcoming second album (written and recorded in Hollywood as well as Southampton), he added: “Creeper was always about theatrics and cinema; as much about the aesthetic as the music. So we took it to Hollywood and made it in the shadow of some of our favourite films, where some classic records have been made, and let it become something else. In Born Cold, you can hear the DNA of the band and listen to it be transformed with the addition of some of the new elements that we’ve added to the process.”</p>
      <p>There’s been no official word on when to expect album two from Creeper, but keep your eyes on Kerrang! for the latest news.</p>
