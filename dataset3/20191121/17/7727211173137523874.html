      <h1>'Minor miracle' as austerity-ravaged Knowsley Council balances budget</h1>
      <h2>Knowsley Council forecasts overspending on services but government grants mean the local authority remains in the black</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:09:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/christopher-mckeon/" target="_blank">Christopher McKeon</a></address>
      <p>Knowsley Council’s leaders have hailed a “minor miracle” as they forecast delivering a balanced budget for this year.</p>
      <p>At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley-council">Knowsley’s</a> finance chief Cllr Jayne Aston said the local authority expected to be £756,000 under budget at the end of the financial year.</p>
      <p>Cllr Aston told fellow cabinet members: “You will be more than aware of the challenges that Knowsley has faced since 2010 - the £100million cuts, and we are the hardest hit council in the country - which makes the report we are considering tonight all the more impressive.”</p>
      <p>She added: “It’s been an awful lot of hard work over the last 10 years.</p>

      <p>“We are not out of the woods yet, but it is a minor miracle to find ourselves in such a good financial position.”</p>
      <p>However, while the council’s overall budget is forecast to be in surplus, spending on council services is expected to be £651,000 over budget, thanks mainly to increasing pressures on children’s social care and education.</p>
      <p>The children’s social care budget is forecast to be £838,000 over budget, while transport costs in education have driven that department’s deficit to £202,000.</p>
      <p>But a £1.4million grant from the government - compensation for business rate relief - means that the council is able to cover its deficit this year and return a balanced budget.</p>
      <p>Next year, additional funding for social care and changes to pension contributions mean the council expects to be £3.6million in surplus, although this will include a potential 4% rise in council tax.</p>
      <p>However, Cllr Aston said, “continued financial uncertainty” made it difficult to plan the council’s finances beyond 2021.</p>
      <p>Knowsley’s leader, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/knowsley-council-leader">Cllr Graham Morgan</a> , said: “There has been some very hard decisions that have been made over the last few years.</p>
      <p>“£100million of our budget has been slashed. Just imagine where we would be if we had a level playing field with our funding.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Morgan also congratulated council staff for their “dedicated work” in delivering the balanced budget.</p>
