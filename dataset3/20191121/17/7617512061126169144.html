      <h1>Victoria Hospitals Foundation hopes to raise $4M for new imaging equipment</h1>

      <p>The Victoria Hospitals Foundation launched its latest fundraising campaign on Thursday with a story of how the new technology it hopes to acquire can change lives.</p>
      <p>The foundation is aiming to raise $4 million for imaging equipment. A leading-edge CT scanner and 3 Tesla MRI have already been purchased, and were on display at Royal Jubilee Hospital at Thursday’s launch event.</p>
      <p>Mitch Lepore, who suffered a life-altering brain injury when he fell from a 15-metre cliff during a hike in 2012, said imaging didn’t just play a pivotal role during the acute stage of his injury.</p>
      <p>“[It] also helped provide my family and myself insight into how my injury had and would impact my life,” said Lepore, who credits Victoria General Hospital caregivers with saving his life.</p>
      <p>More than 275,000 medical imaging procedures are performed at Royal Jubilee and Victoria General hospitals every year.</p>
      <p>“For medical imaging to be effective, we need powerful equipment,” said Tom Siemens, the foundation vice-chairman, noting donors fund 40 per cent of the equipment in area hospitals.</p>
      <p>The new CT scanner can give 1,000 images, compared with 20 on the old machine, while exposing the patient to less radiation.</p>
      <p>A new ultrasound machine has improved spatial resolution, to provide better images, while the new MRI machine has faster imaging and higher-resolution images.</p>
      <p>“We are now seeing things that we have never seen before,” said Dr. Alan Andrew, a radiologist and acting medical director of medical imaging for Island Health.</p>
      <p>Although the goal is to raise $11 million in total, $7 million in funding has already been secured — $2.4 million from the Victoria Hospitals Foundation, and the remaining $4.6 million shared between Island Health and the Capital Regional Hospital District.</p>
      <p>The campaign, dubbed Big Picture, is looking to the community to raise the remaining $4 million — $1 million has already been raised at the Victoria Hospitals Foundation’s Visions Gala event on Nov. 16.</p>
      <p>Contributions can be made online, by calling 250-519-1750 or mailing donations to Wilson Block, 1952 Bay St., Victoria, B.C., V8R 1J8.</p>
