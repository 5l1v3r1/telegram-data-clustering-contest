      <p>You’ll soon be able to match up with other World of Warships: Legends players on PS4 and Xbox One through cross-play.</p>
      <p>If you play <b>World of Warships: Legends</b>, you will soon be able to enjoy a bit of cross-play between other Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players.</p>
      <p>At the moment, it will only work in matchmaker, so you won’t be able to interact between the consoles in regards to voice-chat or playing with friends who are on a different console. Still, it’s a start.</p>
