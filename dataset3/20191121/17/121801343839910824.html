      <p>Film Independent's Spirit Awards nominating committee clearly tried to give as many worthy films as possible a taste of the spotlight in the nominations for the 35th annual Spirit Awards that were <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/spirit-award-nominations-2020-complete-list-1250773">announced on Thursday morning</a>, while prioritizing films that truly needed a boost.</p>
      <p>The Spirit Awards honor the year's best achievements for U.S. films made within a budget of $22.5 million.</p>
      <p>It was a big day for indie studio A24, which led with 18 noms, including a field-leading five each for <b>Benny Safdie</b> and <b>Josh Safdie</b>'s <i>Uncut Gems</i> and <b>Robert Eggers</b>' <i>The Lighthouse.</i></p>
      <p><b>Noah Baumbach</b>'s critically praised <i>Marriage Story</i>, which Netflix is pushing as hard as any indie is being pushed this season, was nominated for only two awards, but they are biggies: best feature and best screenplay. And the low tally is not because the nominating committee didn't like it, but because they found a way to show how much they liked it without having to deprive other films of more needed recognition: giving it the <b>Robert Altman</b> Award, which celebrates a director, cast and casting director, while also taking those individuals — among them <b>Adam Driver</b>, <b>Scarlett Johansson</b>, <b>Alan Alda</b> and <b>Laura Linney</b> — out of competition. I would imagine that all parties are pleased about that.</p>
      <p>Apart from <i>Marriage Story</i>, <i>Uncut Gems</i> and <b>Chinonye Chukwu</b>'s <i>Clemency</i> (Neon) are the only films to receive both feature and screenplay noms. The other feature nominees are <i>The Farewell</i> (A24) and <i>A Hidden Life</i> (Fox Searchlight), both very much on-the-bubble best picture Oscar contenders; and the other screenplay nominees are <i>To Dust</i> (Good Deed), which was written by <b>Jason Begue</b> and <b>Shawn Snyder</b>, and <i>High Flying Bird</i> (Netflix), penned by <b>Tarell Alvin McCraney</b>, both Oscar long shots.</p>
      <p><b>Alma Har'el</b>'s <i>Honey Boy</i> (Amazon) landed four nods but disappointingly missed out on a feature nom. Har'el was nominated for directing, and the film's two principal stars, <b>Shia LaBeouf</b> and <b>Noah Jupe</b>, were both nominated in the supporting category. LaBeouf is continuing to build momentum towards an Oscar nom, which would cap a remarkable comeback. But perhaps we have been underestimating Jupe's prospects — the 14-year-old Brit very capably carries a large part of a film that many clearly love.</p>
      <p>The <i>Honey Boy</i> duo is joined in the supporting male category by <i>The Lighthouse</i>'s <b>Willem Dafoe</b>, an indie darling who may well be headed toward his third Oscar nomination in three years, plus <b>Jonathan Majors</b> for <i>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</i> (A24), a wonderful little film which probably needed a better showing on Thursday to remain even in the Oscar mix, and <b>Wendell Pierce</b> for <i>Burning Cane</i> (Array).</p>
      <p><b>Kirill Mikhanovsky</b>'s <i>Give Me Liberty</i> (Music Box) landed a very impressive four nominations, thanks largely to a grassroots campaign being mounted by the boutique PR firm Robertson Taylor Partners, including one in the supporting female race acknowledging the excellent work of <b>Lauren 'LoLo' Spencer</b>, who plays a young woman with ALS on an unusually crazy day. (The actress has ALS in real life as well.)</p>
      <p>Spencer is joined in the category by <i>The Farewell</i>'s 'Nai Nai,' <b>Zhao Shuzhen</b>, a veteran Chinese actress who is chugging along towards what would be a feel-good Oscar nom; Oscar winner <b>Octavia Spencer</b> for <i>Luce</i> (Neon); <b>Taylor Russell</b>, a breakout from<i> Waves</i> (A24), which otherwise performed disappointingly with the nom-com; and the wild-card in the group, <b>Jennifer Lopez</b> for<i> Hustlers</i> (STX), who does not generally hang in indie circles, but who is undeniably amazing in this role and is probably en route to an Oscar nomination, at least.</p>
      <p><i>Hustlers</i> was also nominated for best director (<b>Lorene Scafaria</b>) — she and Har'el will compete against the Safdies, Eggers and <i>Luce</i>'s <b>Julius Onah</b> — and best cinematography, a show of considerable strength for a film that was on few pundits' awards radar prior to breaking out at the Toronto International Film Festival.</p>
      <p>Speaking of people not usually associated with indies, <b>Adam Sandler</b>'s turn in <i>Uncut Gems</i> impressed the nom-com enough to land a best male lead nom, which keeps him very much in the mix of a hotly contested best actor Oscar race. He is joined in the category by <b>Robert Pattinson</b> for <i>The Lighthouse</i>, <b>Kelvin Harrison, Jr.</b> for <i>Luce</i>, <b>Matthias Schoenaerts</b> for <i>The Mustang</i> (Focus) and <b>Chris Galust</b> for <i>Give Me Liberty</i>, all much longer shots for Academy recognition.</p>
      <p><b>Renee Zellweger</b> was always a slam-dunk female lead nominee for <i>Judy</i>. She is joined by two genuinely on-the-bubble contenders, <i>Clemency</i>'s <b>Alfre Woodard</b> and <b>Elisabeth Moss</b> for <i>Her Smell</i> (Gunpower &amp; Sky), plus three others from much lower-profile films, for whom this will almost certainly be the highlight of the season: <b>Mary Kay Place</b> for <i>Diane</i> (IFC), <b>Karen Allen</b> for <i>Colewell</i> (still seeking U.S. distribution) and <b>Hong Chau</b> for <i>Driveways</i> (still seeking U.S. distribution).</p>
      <p>And then there is the international feature category. Film Independent voters nominated the Oscar entries from South Korea (Neon's Oscar frontrunner <i>Parasite</i>), France (Amazon's <i>Les Miserables</i>), Brazil (Amazon's <i>Invisible Life</i>) and Peru (Wolfe Releasing's <i>Retablo</i>), plus another film from France (Neon's <i>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</i>) and the U.K. (A24's <i>The Souvenir</i>) — but did not invite <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>, <i>The Two Popes</i> or any other English-language films which were actually eligible in that category.</p>
