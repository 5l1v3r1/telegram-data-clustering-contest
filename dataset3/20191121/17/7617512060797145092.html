      <h1>Premier, Canucks alumni celebrate team’s 50 years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:03:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Cleve Dheensaw</a></address>
      <p>John Horgan took a selfie with Vancouver Canucks great Stan Smyl on Thursday inside the premier’s office.</p>
      <p>That it wasn’t the other way around showed the power of sporting heroes.</p>
      <p>Horgan presented several gathered Canucks alumni with a framed proclamation, signed by the Queen, honouring the club’s 50th anniversary in the National Hockey League.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been a Canucks fan from Day 1,” said Horgan. “Abandoning the [Toronto] Maple Leafs wasn’t hard to do.”</p>
      <p>Two of the Canucks in attendance, 53-year-old former defenceman Jyrki Lumme and 36-year-old former forward Chris Higgins, played in the two biggest moments in team history.</p>
      <p>Both ended bitterly in Game 7 losses in the Stanley Cup finals. For Lumme, it was in 1994 and for Higgins in 2011.</p>
      <p>“Coming close is not good enough,” said Lumme. “We just need the Stanley Cup here.”</p>
      <p>Those losses haven’t diminished the passion that fans from Duncan to Dawson Creek and Sooke to Salmo have for the club, however.</p>
      <p>“You see it in how excited people get when the Canucks alumni stage charity games in smaller communities around B.C.,” said Lumme, a native of Finland.</p>
      <p>“It makes us feel good.”</p>
      <p>Having the Canucks as the lone NHL team in the province makes for a different dynamic than in Alberta, where loyalties are divided between the Edmonton Oilers and Calgary Flames.</p>
      <p>“We really notice that when the Canucks alumni do their reach-out work — it’s not just Vancouver,” said Higgins, who grew up in Smithtown, New York, with his choice of Buffalo Sabres, New York Rangers and New York Islanders to root for.</p>
      <p>“It’s the whole province of B.C. which follows the Canucks.”</p>
      <p>Higgins is now in player development with the Canucks and bullish on what many consider a young, rising team. “There’s a real buzz about the team again,” he said.</p>
      <p>The aim for the season is clear: “The goal is to make the playoffs,” said Smyl, who invited Horgan to be at the first home game of the playoffs.</p>
      <p>The premier smiled and said he would like nothing more.</p>
