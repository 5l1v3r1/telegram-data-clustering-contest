      <h1>Spider-Man Is About To Become Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:11:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Stone</a></address>
      <p>In December, Marvel Comics launches <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/symbiote-spider-man/"><i>Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality</i></a>, a miniseries set during Peter Parker's time bonded to the alien symbiote before it became the villainous Venom. However, as the creative team takes things back to the past, the web-slinger may get a previously unseen magical status quo.</p>
      <p>Marvel has released its <a href="https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-solicitations-february-2020/">solicitation information</a> for titles going on sale in February 2020, including the miniseries' third issue. As Peter looks to overcome an unspecified past trauma, he seeks help from Doctor Strange, presumably leading to an impromptu team-up.</p>
