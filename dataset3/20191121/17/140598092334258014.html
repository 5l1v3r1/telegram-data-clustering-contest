      <p>This poached pear dessert makes an elegant dinner party pudding. It's simple to make and only takes about half an hour to whip up.</p>
      <p><b>Prep time:</b> 15 minutes | <b>Cooking time: </b>15 minutes</p>
      <h3>SERVES</h3>
      <p>Five</p>
      <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
      <p>
        <b>For the stock syrup:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>500ml water</li>
        <li>300g caster sugar</li>
        <li>Juice of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>1 wide strip lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 wide strip orange zest</li>
        <li>1 star anise</li>
        <li>2.5cm piece fresh ginger, peeled</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>For the pears:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 William or conference pears</li>
        <li>400g ricotta (I use Westcombe’s, made in Somerset)</li>
        <li>175g mascarpone</li>
        <li>100g icing sugar</li>
        <li>Grated zest of ½ lemon</li>
        <li>50g toasted hazelnuts, skins rubbed off, roughly chopped</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>METHOD</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put all the ingredients for the stock syrup into a saucepan and bring to the boil.</li>
        <li> Reduce to a simmer and stir until the sugar has dissolved. Remove from the heat and allow to infuse while it cools. This can be kept in the fridge until you need it.</li>
        <li>Peel and carefully core each pear, leaving them whole and ideally with the stalks on. Lay them in a pan, along with the stock syrup.</li>
        <li> Cover with a circle of parchment paper and sit a plate (smaller than the circumference of the pan) on top – this keeps the pears in the syrup while they cook.</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil then turn down to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes, or a little less if the pears are really ripe – check them with the tip of a knife. Remove from the heat and allow to cool in the syrup.</li>
        <li>Beat the ricotta a little just to loosen, then mix in the mascarpone and icing sugar, beating to a smooth silky texture. Mix in the lemon zest.</li>
        <li>To serve, spread the ricotta on five plates. Sit a pear in each one, with a touch of the cooking liquid. Finish with the chopped hazelnuts.</li>
      </ol>
