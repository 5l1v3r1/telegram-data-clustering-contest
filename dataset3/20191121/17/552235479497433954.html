      <h1>NHS Lanarkshire's delayed discharge problems are "out of control", as stats show figures continue to rise</h1>
      <h2>In September, there were 7547 lost bed days because patients were caught up in the system – 402 more than August</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T17:03:58+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 17:03</time> by <a rel="author">Rutherglen Reformer, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rutherglen-reformer/</a></address>
      <p>The delayed discharge problem is getting progressively worse in NHS Lanarkshire – despite previous warnings about patients dying needlessly while stuck on hospital wards.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">The Reformer</a> recently revealed that more than 250 people have died while awaiting discharge from Lanarkshire’s hospitals since July 2016.</p>
      <p>Elderly group Age Scotland warned the figures show a system “spiralling out of control” and demanded an overhaul of health and care provision.</p>
      <p>Those stats alarmed politicians and created a sense of urgency to prevent elderly people passing away following an unnecessary extended stay in hospital wards.</p>
      <p>However, the bed blocking problem is getting worse, according to new figures published by The Scottish Government’s Information Services Division (ISD Scotland).</p>
      <p>In September, there were 7547 lost bed days because patients were caught up in the system – 402 more than August and an increase of 464 on July’s figures.</p>
      <p>Overstretched hospital staff are still struggling with limited resources because 87 percent of all delayed discharges in September were down to health, social care, patient and family-related reasons.</p>
      <p>MSP James Kelly said: “7500 lost bed days in a single month is a horrendously alarming figure.</p>
      <p>“We know our NHS is under immense pressure across a number of different areas and these figures around delayed discharge are just further evidence of the impact that cuts to public services are having on our health service.</p>

      <p>“We must ensure that the necessary social care services are in place to enable patients a transition from our hospitals to a more suitable care facility. Instead, the Scottish Government have been underfunding our councils and hampering their ability to delivery these vital services.”</p>
      <p>Rutherglen SNP MSP Clare Haughey said: “People should not need to spend unnecessary time in hospital once their treatment has completed.</p>
      <p>“The Scottish Government is working with local councils to integrate our health and social care sectors to put greater emphasis on supporting people in their own homes and communities, and therefore reducing the inappropriate use of hospitals and care homes.</p>
      <p>“In 2019/2020, Scottish Government investment in health and social care partnerships will be increased to more than £9billion which will help to accelerate progress and ensure that the integration is making a difference across the country – including here in Rutherglen and Cambuslang.”</p>

      <p>Val de Souza, chief officer of the South Lanarkshire health and social care partnership (SLHSCP), said: “Despite increasing A&amp;E attendances and emergency admissions – both of which are up by almost three percent year-on-year – in South Lanarkshire we have been seeing an improving position in relation to delayed discharge over the past three years.</p>
      <p>“There have been significant challenges over recent months which has seen an increase in the number of delays. However, additional actions undertaken are showing an improving position in the past month.</p>
      <p>“Patient safety is NHS Lanarkshire’s priority. A priority shared with both health and social care partnerships.</p>
      <p>“SLHSCP, with capital investment from South Lanarkshire Council, is also embarking on an £18m redesign and modernisation programme relating to care homes.</p>
      <p>“This is a very positive move which will add significant capacity to the whole system to support the anticipated and continuing growth in demand.”</p>
      <p>Chief officer of health and social care North Lanarkshire, Ross McGuffie said: “Reducing delayed discharges is one of our key priorities and we are continuing to take steps to make improvements in this  area.</p>
      <p>“We are also expanding specialist home support services which help to provide additional support, enabling people to live more independent lives and supporting a continued reduction in home support related bed days.” The delayed discharge of patients has been a growing concern locally and nationally.</p>

      <p>Across Scotland, almost 500 people passed away last year while needlessly stuck on hospital wards – up 20 per cent on 2017-18.</p>
      <p>In Lanarkshire, 255 people have died waiting for discharge in the past three years, with 239 of those down to health and social care reasons.</p>
      <p>There were two cases linked to patient and family-related reasons, 11 where health chiefs explained why deaths were outwith their control, while three causes were unknown.</p>
      <p>On average, 182 hospital beds were occupied every day last year across the local health authority because of delayed discharge.</p>
