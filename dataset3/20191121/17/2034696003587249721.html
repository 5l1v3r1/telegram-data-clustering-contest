        <b>"Sometimes these things hurt me because I'm human"</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chris Martin has admitted that he was “hurt” by tweets about his appearances at <a href="https://www.nme.com/festivals/glastonbury">Glastonbury Festival</a> this year and confirmed that <a href="http://nme.com/artists/coldplay">Coldplay</a> won’t headline next year’s edition.</p>
      <p>The singer made two surprise appearances at the festival, performing ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/watch-stormzy-duet-with-chris-martin-on-blinded-by-your-grace-pt-1-at-glastonbury-2518851">Blinded By Your Grace Pt. 1′ with Stormzy</a> and joining <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-nick-cave-chris-martin-join-kylie-minogue-onstage-glastonbury-2519844">Kylie Minogue for ‘Can’t Get You Out Of My Head</a>‘ during her acclaimed legends slot.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with the BBC’s Colin Paterson, Martin simply responded “No”, when asked if Coldplay will headline the festival next year.</p>
      <p>When further pressed for an explanation, he said: “I did pop up on stage last year and I loved doing so.</p>
      <p>“Then I saw a tweet afterwards which said ‘you can always rely on him to come on in a tracksuit and ruin everything’.</p>

      <p>“So I was like you know what, a), I should work on my trousers, and b), I shouldn’t be online and c), maybe just go and watch Glastonbury for a year or so.”</p>
      <p>When asked if the tweet affected him, he replied: “Sometimes these things hurt me because I’m human.”</p>
      <p>The same interview saw Martin admitting that Coldplay are <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-say-wont-touring-live-can-make-touring-environmentally-beneficial-2570153">taking time to consider how they tour in the future</a> in order to make it as environmentally friendly as possible.</p>
      <p>“We’re taking time to see how our tour can be actively beneficial…All of us have to work out the best way of doing our job,” he said.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-a-snippet-of-aardman-animations-amazing-animated-coldplay-video-for-new-single-daddy-2567719">Coldplay dropped a new video for latest single, ‘Daddy’, which has been made by Aardman Animations.</a> The band also shared another new song ‘Champion Of The World’, with a co-write credit given to the late Frightened Rabbit frontman Scott Hutchison. You can <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/coldplay-champion-of-the-world-daddy-scott-hutchison-owl-john-interview-2569888">read all about how the song came to be as well as Frightened Rabbit’s exclusive NME interview on the collaboration here</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, tomorrow sees Coldplay <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/coldplay-everyday-life-review">release ‘Everyday Life’</a>, their eighth album. In a four-star review, NME described it as “a confounding experiment from a deceptively forward-thinking band”.</p>
