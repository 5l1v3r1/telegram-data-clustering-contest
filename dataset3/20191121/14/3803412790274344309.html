      <p>For those of you that don't know already, shiny Pokémon are rare, alternately-colored creatures that appear in the Pokémon series. Sometimes shinies are super obvious, like the case of the sheep Pokémon Wooloo whose normal form has white fleece, but has a shiny variant with black fleece. However, others are far more subtle, like how a shiny Pikachu only has a slightly different shade of yellow. Your usual chances of getting a shiny Pokémon are 1/4096, which makes them super rare to come across. However, Sword and Shield also introduces "super shiny" Pokémon that are even rarer. Fortunately, there are ways to make a shiny more likely to appear. Here's how to increase your chances of catching shiny Pokémon and "super shiny" Pokémon in Sword and Shield.</p>

      <h3>A few things you need to know about shiny hunting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Unlike Let's Go, Pikachu!, and Let's Go, Eevee!, you can't tell if a Pokémon is shiny when you're walking around. You must engage it in battle to tell if it's shiny.</li>
        <li>Unlike previous games, you cannot get a shiny starter. Don't try to soft restart your game. It will just be a waste of time.</li>
        <li>You don't have to worry about coming across a shiny Pokémon that's too high-leveled for you to catch in the Wild Area. The coding doesn't allow this to happen.</li>
        <li>When you come upon a shiny, sparkles and light emit around the Pokémon. You're going to want to pay attention for this if you're shiny hunting a Pokémon that doesn't look a whole lot different from its original coloring.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Shiny Pokémon vs. "Super Shiny" Pokémon</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Several players have reported that they've found a brand new variant of shiny Pokémon. To be more precise, two different types of shiny Pokémon appear in Sword and Shield. One of them is much rarer than the other and has been dubbed "super shiny" by the internet. Regular shiny Pokémon pop out with stars glittering around them whereas super shiny Pokémon appear with squares as seen in the picture above.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Kaphotics/status/1197027047224176640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>This has lead data miners to jump into Sword and Shield's coding to figure out if the shiny odds have been affected. According to respected data miner, Kurt, the odds of catching shinies are still 1/4096. However, 15/16 shiny Pokémon will show stars whereas only 1/16 shiny Pokémon will show squares. That makes super shinies super rare to come across with only a chance of 1/65536!</p>
      <p>If you happen to catch one of these ultra-rare Pokémon let us know! We'd love to hear about it.</p>
      <h3>How to increase your chances of finding a shiny</h3>
      <h4>Catch combos</h4>

      </p>
      <p>If you played the Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! games, you might be aware of something called catch combos. This means that you fight and catch the same Pokémon, say Nicket, repeatedly without fighting any others. Each time you catch the same Pokémon, the chances of finding a shiny increases. After you've caught the Pokemon 25 times in a row, your chances of catching a shiny go up from 1/4096 to <b>1/2048</b>. However, the percentage can't go up anymore after 25 chain encounters.</p>
      <p>So basically, aim to <b>catch the same Pokémon 25+ times in a row</b> to seriously increase your chances of happening upon a shiny. This process can take hours to pay off, but it's fun flaunting that Pokémon once you've caught it. If you accidentally run into another Pokémon other than the one you're focusing on, run away. Keep in mind that accidentally catching another Pokémon will break your combo, and then you'll have to start your combo streak over.</p>
      <p>Since the game is so new, there might be other things that we don't know that can influence your catch combos. For example, a Pokémon fleeing from you in battle could break the streak. We'll update when we learn more.</p>
      <h4>Total Pokémon fought</h4>

      </figure>
      <p><i>Source: iMore</i>At the time I took this screenshot, I had fought Wooloo 616 times.</p>
      <p>Another way to increase your chances is by having battled a Pokémon several times during your game. You can check to see how many times you've fought a specific Pokémon by checking your Pokédex. Your chances of finding a shiny increase incrementally when you've fought the same Pokemon 1, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, or 500 times total. That means that the best way to increase your chances is by having fought the <b>same Pokémon 500 times</b> during the course of your game. That's definitely a lot, but for the serious shiny hunter, it's worth it. If you've gotten to the end of the game, you might have gotten close to that number. Otherwise, it will take a lot of work to battle a Pokémon that much.</p>
      <h4>Combining the two together</h4>
      <p>Of course, the best way to help you catch a shiny Pokémon is to do all of the above things. Capture the intended Pokémon 500 times total throughout the game, catch the same Pokémon exclusively 25+ times in a row, and have the Shiny Charm. When you do this, you're not guaranteed to find a shiny right away, but your chances of coming across one go way up to <b>1/455</b>. If you happen to get the Shiny Charm as well, your chances go up even higher.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>For those of you who like to know percentages, the respected data miner, Kurt, did the work and figured out the exact catching percentages you get when you combine the number of Pokémon caught in a row with the number of Pokémon caught total.</p>
      <h4>Getting the Shiny Charm</h4>

      <p>If you're adamant about getting shiny Pokémon, then you'll want to get the Shiny Charm. This is a reward you recieve for completing the Galar region Pokédex. In order to do that, you'll need to <a href="https://www.imore.com/pokemon-sword-and-shield-how-trade-pokemon">trade Pokémon</a> with friends or people online to get the version exclusive Pokémon not found in your game.</p>
      <p>Once you have all 400 Pokémon, travel to Circhester and go to the first hotel you see in the city. You'll need to take the elevator to the top floor and then head to the room that's farthest on the left of the building. Enter the room and talk to the doctor. He'll give you the Shiny Charm, which will increase your chances of coming upon a shiny Pokémon to <b>1/458</b>.</p>
      <h4>Shiny cheat sheet</h4>
      <p>Instagram user, shinyinstinct, has created this awesome cheat sheet for helping you know what your chances of catching a shiny are. You'll likely want to reference it as you're shiny hunting.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The following method has existed in previous Pokémon games, but it's as yet unconfirmed if it works the same way in Sword and Shield:</p>
      <p>You might also be able to increase your chances of hatching a shiny Pokémon by using the <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Masuda_method">Masuda Method</a>, which happens when parent Pokémon from different language versions are bred together. So for example, if you got a Chinese Butterfree in an online trade and you dropped it off with an English Butterfree at the Nursery, your chances of getting a shiny Pokémon from the ensuing egg would be 1/1638. That's a large increase from the initial 1/4096 chances. Once again, it's unknown if this method has the same chances in Sword and Shield, but it's still likely to increase your shiny chances if you use it.</p>
      <p>If it does work, then the best way to get a shiny Pokémon would be to breed with a foreign Ditto. That's because Ditto can breed with just about every Pokémon in your Pokédex, so you can work on getting just about any shiny. A good way to get a foreign Ditto is to catch a Ditto yourself and then try to find an online user from another country who is willing to trade their Ditto for yours.</p>
