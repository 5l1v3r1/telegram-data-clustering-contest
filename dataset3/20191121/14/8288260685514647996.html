      <h1>The 20 Solihull sites where traffic restrictions will be placed and what it will mean</h1>
      <h2>There is a 'daily invasion' of cars during the school run, according to locals</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:15:46+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:15</time> by <a rel="author">David Irwin, https://www.facebook.com/David-Irwin-Local-Democracy-Reporter-792811574238027/?ref=settings</a></address>
      <p>Fed-up residents in a Solihull suburb have made a fresh appeal for the council to deal with the "daily invasion" of cars during the school run.</p>
      <p>Those living in Grandborough Drive and its various side streets have called for parking restrictions to be imposed to put a stop to <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/school-parking-problem-causing-fury-16992279">the problems they say are blighting their lives.</a></p>
      <p>Their latest call for action comes as the highways department sets out plans to roll out new traffic regulation orders (TROs) at 20 sites around the borough.</p>
      <p>An extra £20,000 has been allocated to deal with troublesome locations in 2020/21, allowing restrictions to be introduced in more places than normal.</p>

      <p>But with more than 100 separate requests, the increased budget still means that almost five in six sites, including Grandborough Drive, are not deemed a high enough priority at this stage.</p>
      <p>Road chiefs admitted this week that it was impossible to please everyone, although those in the cluster of cul-de-sacs, off Whitefields Road, argue that the number of schools in the vicinity makes their area a special case.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Judy Middleton, speaking on behalf of 78 local households, said that introducing restrictions from 8am-4pm, Monday to Friday, would improve road safety and reduce air pollution.</p>
      <p>"The current parking situation is intolerable, it's got steadily worse year-on-year as the schools have increased their pupil numbers.</p>
      <p>"Our roads are reduced to narrow single-lane highways, with virtually no passing places, compelling vehicles to illegally drive along pavements for long stretches to clear the gridlock. It is so dangerous.</p>
      <p>"So I urge you, please give your support to our request and release us from this daily misery."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ward councillor Joe Tildesley (Con, St Alphege) said residents were "plagued" by congestion and dangerous manoeuvres and the situation was "only getting worse."</p>
      <p>"They are trapped in their homes during the school opening and closing times and the school holidays are a blessed relief," he said.</p>
      <p>Cllr Ken Hawkins, cabinet member for the environment and highways, said he sympathised with residents who bore the brunt of school parking problems.</p>

      <p>"I've got on my iPad cars parked on double yellow lines [and] in front of people's houses in my ward and I've been with fellow councillors and challenged them and they've just walked straight past us."</p>
      <p>He said that the comments made by those in the Grandborough Drive area would be considered and an update was expected in January.</p>
      <h3>The 20 priority projects</h3>
      <p>Starley Way, Marston Green - obstructive parking</p>
      <p>Church Lane, Berkswell - limited waiting for shop customers</p>
      <p>Beechcroft Road, Castle Bromwich - parking near to junction</p>
      <p>Valley Road, Elmdon - parking opposite junction with Ventnor Road</p>
      <p>Daimler Close, Smith's Wood - obstructive parking near traffic calming feature</p>
      <p>Widney Road and Milton Road, Bentley Heath - footway and obstructive parking</p>
      <p>Gilson Way, Kingshurst - obstructive school parking</p>
      <p>Auckland Drive and Windward Way, Smith's Wood - verge, footway and obstructive parking linked to school and college</p>
      <p>Dorridge village - review of on-street parking</p>
      <p>Lodge Road and Longdon Road, Knowle - obstructive parking</p>
      <p>Cranmore Boulevard area, Shirley - obstructive parking</p>
      <p>Sharmans Cross Road and Woodside Way, Solihull - school parking</p>
      <p>Brookvale Road, Olton - obstructive parking/nuisance for businesses</p>
      <p>Tanworth Lane area, Shirley - obstructive parking</p>
      <p>School Close, Smith's Wood - obstructive school parking</p>
      <p>Dickens Heath Road, Dickens Heath - obstructive school parking</p>
      <p>Mill Lane, Bentley Heath - extension of double yellow lines</p>
      <p>Lyndon Road and Chapel Fields Road - obstructive school and park parking</p>
      <p>St Bernards Road, Olton - obstructive parking linked to the station</p>
      <p>Neville Road and Sansome Road, Shirley - obstructive parking linked to station and shopping areas.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>In a report to Cllr Hawkins' latest decision session -  in which all 108 requests were ranked by order of priority - the location was No 51, putting it at near the bottom of the council's "reserve list".</p>
      <p>Paul Tovey, from the highways team, said that the current system for scoring TRO requests was now in its tenth year but it could "only please some".</p>
      <p>Usually around £30,000 is allocated to deal with the highest priority projects, enough for between 10-12 schemes. Although an increased budget of £50,000 for next year has meant that slightly more will move forward.</p>
