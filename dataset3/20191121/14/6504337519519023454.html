      <p><b>LATEST: Nov. 21, 8:45 a.m.: </b>Another round of potentially blustery weather on Sunday has entered the Bay Area forecast, and Pacific Gas and Electric said in a statement the situation is being "actively monitored."</p>
      <p>"At this time, no determination has been made on a potential PSPS," PG&amp;E spokesperson Mayra Tostado said, referring to a potential Public Safety Power Shutoff.</p>
      <p>Onshore winds are expected to develop Sunday and continue into Monday morning. "Right now those details are hard to nail down," said Roger Gass, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. "There’s not a lot of confidence with respect to wind. Right now it’s in the monitor stage and not one of great concern at the moment."</p>
      <p>Onshore winds aren't out of the norm in the fall, but this season conditions are unique as the region has seen extremely low rainfall. Downtown San Francisco has measured .03 inch since Oct. 1. Normally through Nov. 21, the city would expect to see 3.06 inches. The Santa Rosa Airport has measured .05. The average value for this time of year is 4.98. San Jose has recorded .06 compared to the seasonal average of 1.79 inches.</p>
      <p>Amid a dry fall, the landscape and vegetation is parched, creating ideal conditions for wildfires to spark and spread.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: Nov. 21, 8 a.m.: </b>Pacific Gas and Electric said in statement on Thursday morning that wind conditions had improved and an "all clear" was issued, meaning it's safe for inspections and restoration work to begin.</p>
      <p>"PG&amp;E expects all customers to be restored by tonight or sooner, pending damages found on the system," PG&amp;E said in a statement.</p>
      <p>As of 6 a.m., approximately 10,000 of the approximately 50,000 customers impacted by the November 20 shutoff had been restored.</p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: Nov. 21, 6:45 a.m.</b> Pacific Gas and Electric said it will begin the restoration process Thursday morning for 50,000 Northern California customers who were put in the dark to reduce wildfire risk, according to a statement released Wednesday night.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E was originally preparing to cut power to up to 300,000 customers in 25 counties, but as weather conditions improved the scope was scaled back.</p>
      <p>In the end, people were impacted in portions of Butte, Colusa, Glenn, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, Shasta, Solano, Sonoma, Tehama and Yolo counties.</p>
      <p>The restoration process is underway. About 4,800 customers in Napa and Sonoma counties saw the lights go back on as of 6 p.m. Thursday. PG&amp;E will continue to inspect equipment and make any repairs on wind-damaged equipment Thursday morning and turn power back on in other areas.</p>
      <p>"Current weather predictions point to a possible restoration for most customers by late Thursday," PG&amp;E said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Winds developed in the North Bay Wednesday morning and continued to blow through the day. A 73 mph gust knocked Mount St. Helena and a 59 mph gust was recorded in the Healdsburg Hills. The East Bay hills were also gusty and a 56 mph wind was measured atop Mount Diablo.</p>
      <p>Winds subsided overnight and at about 5 a.m. the National Weather Service's Bay Area office canceled a Red Flag Warning for the North Bay and East Bay hills that was supposed to run through 7 a.m.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E said winds with speeds exceeding 50 mph developed in most other counties where the power was cut.</p>
      <p>On Sunday going into Monday morning, more blustery weather is in the forecast with northerly winds developing.</p>
      <p>"Right now those details are hard to nail down," said Roger Gass, a forecaster with the National Weather Service. "There’s not a lot of confidence with respect to wind. Right now it’s in the monitor stage and not one of great concern at the moment."</p>
      <p>SFGATE reached out to PG&amp;E for comment on the Sunday–Monday forecast and will update the story when we hear back.</p>
