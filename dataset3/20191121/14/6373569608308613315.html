      <h1>How much money Plymouth Argyle have made from cup competitions so far this season</h1>
      <h2>The Pilgrims will be away to Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup second round on December 1</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:35:26+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:35</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Errington</a></address>
      <p>Plymouth Argyle have picked up £88,500 in prize money from three cup competitions this season.</p>
      <p>But the real riches can still be made by <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">Ryan Lowe's Pilgrims</a> if they can progress further in the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Argyle will be away to Bristol Rovers, managed by former Argyle defender Graham Coughlan, in the second round next weekend.</p>
      <p>The game at the Memorial Stadium will be played on Sunday, December 1 with a 2pm kick-off so it can form part of the BBC Final Score programme.</p>
      <p>That will earn both clubs £12,500 in TV fees as a result, while the winners of the tie will receive £54,000 in prize money.</p>
      <p>A televised second round replay between Argyle and Rovers at Home Park would be worth £36,000 apiece.</p>
      <p>However, it is in third round of the FA Cup where the prize money and TV fees become very considerable.</p>
      <p>Third round winners receive £135,000 in prize money, and the broadcast fee for a televised tie at that stage of the competition is £114,000 per club.</p>
      <p>So, for example, if Argyle were to beat Rovers in a televised replay and then be chosen for a live broadcast of a third round tie against a top Premier League club at Home Park, they would earn £204,000.</p>
      <p>That is excluding the gate receipts from what would probably be an 18,000 sell-out at the Theatre of Greens.</p>
      <p>Here is a breakdown of the prize money that Argyle have received so far this season:</p>
      <p>
        <b>EFL Cup</b>
      </p>
      <p>First round winners vs Leyton Orient: £5,000</p>
      <p>Total: £5,000 + gate receipts</p>
      <p>
        <b>EFL Trophy</b>
      </p>
      <p>Participation fee: £20,000</p>
      <p>Draw vs Bristol Rovers £5,000</p>
      <p>Win vs Swindon Town: £10,000</p>
      <p>Total: £35,000 + gate receipts</p>
      <p>
        <b>FA Cup</b>
      </p>
      <p>First round winners vs Bolton Wanderers: £36,000</p>
      <p>Bristol Rovers tie moved to Sunday: £12,500</p>
      <p>Total so far: £48,500 + gate receipts</p>
      <p><b>Overall total:</b> £88,500 + gate receipts</p>
