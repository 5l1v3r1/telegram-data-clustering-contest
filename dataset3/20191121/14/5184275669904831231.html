        <b>Reach</b>
      </p>
      <p>Comedy is one of the most favourite genres of Indian audience and the business comedy films have done at the Box Office in past is the proof. <i>Pagalpanti</i> is a multistarrer comedy film with interesting stars like John Abraham, Arshad Warsi &amp; Anil Kapoor leading the pack. Apart from the star value of these stars helping the reach of the film, good promotions have also boosted the visibility. Trailers and Music have been average but the reach is still in a safe zone.</p>
      <p>I’ll rate the Reach of Pagalpanti one day before its release as <b>6.5/10</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Buzz</b>
      </p>
      <p>If the promos and music were strong, the film could’ve garnered a huge buzz pan India but it’s still ok. The buzz for <i>Pagalpanti</i> is good in Tier 2 &amp; Tier 3 areas but just about fair in Tier 1.</p>
      <p>I’ll rate the current buzz of the film as <b>4.75/10</b>.</p>
      <p>Overall, <i>Pagalpanti</i> is all set for a good start thanks to its genre and star cast. The film will get good support from small city audiences but will struggle in multiplexes. A Day 1 close to <b>10 crores</b> is still very much expected from it. Even if the initial word of mouth is not encouraging, the opening day won’t be far from the mark.</p>
