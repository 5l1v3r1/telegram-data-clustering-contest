      <p>As hormones change to support the new life inside you, pregnancy comes with myriad symptoms. Here’s what you can expect each trimester of your pregnancy.</p>
      <h3>First-trimester symptoms (1-12 weeks)</h3>
      <p>Each woman is different, and so is each pregnancy, so hormonal changes during pregnancy will have varying effects. But below are some of the most common symptoms you can expect in your first trimester.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Nausea and vomiting:</b> According to a <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/getting-pregnant/early-pregnancy-symptoms/">survey</a> by the American Pregnancy Association (APA), 25% of women said morning sickness was their first symptom. “Nausea and vomiting are triggered by the increase of the hormone, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG),” Marianna Vardaka, an ObGyn at <a href="https://www.trihealth.com/hospitals-and-practices/trihealth-associates-in-ob-gyn/">TriHealth</a>, says. “An empty stomach can worsen these symptoms.” More than <a href="https://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-health/morning-sickness-during-pregnancy/">50%</a> of women experience nausea during the first trimester.</li>
        <li><b>Missed period or spotting:</b> According to the same APA survey, 29% of women said a late period was their first symptom. That’s because once an egg implants in the uterus, it halts the menstrual cycle. You may still experience some spotting or implantation bleeding, which can occur as the egg moves to attach to the uterine wall.</li>
        <li><b>Increased urination:</b> Your amount of blood increases to support the nutritional needs of the baby. That means more blood is filtered by your kidneys increasing how often you need to urinate.</li>
        <li><b>Fatigue:</b> Your body is producing more of a hormone called progesterone, which is known to cause fatigue as well as vomiting, nausea, constipation, and heartburn.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other hormone-related symptoms that can pop up in your first trimester include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Tender or swollen breasts</li>
        <li>Moodiness</li>
        <li>Bloating</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/when-do-pregnancy-cravings-start">Food craving</a> and aversions</li>
        <li>Heartburn</li>

        </li>

      </ul>
      <p>There are <a href="https://www.insider.com/is-tylenol-safe-for-pregnancy">some medications</a> you can take for aches and pains.</p>
      <h3>Second-trimester symptoms (13-28 weeks)</h3>
      <p>Most women find the second trimester easier as their body adjusts to the hormone changes. Fatigue typically subsides and you should have more energy, says Vardaka.</p>
      <p>At this point in your pregnancy, you’ll likely start to notice other symptoms associated with hormonal changes and the growing baby.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Lower back pain:</b> By the end of the second trimester, the baby will weigh 2 to 3 pounds and measure 13 to 16 inches long. To compensate for this growth, women often lean backward, which strains the lower back.</li>
        <li><b><a href="https://www.todaysparent.com/pregnancy/when-to-worry-about-swelling-during-pregnancy/">Swelling</a>:</b> Your body retains significantly more fluid while pregnant, so it’s normal to experience some swelling in your ankles and feet.</li>
        <li><b>Patches of darker skin on the face and around the nipples:</b> Your body starts producing more melanin pigments that cause certain parts of your body to darken, including the skin around your eyes and nose.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Third-trimester symptoms (29-40 weeks)</h3>
      <p>Many of the symptoms you experience in the second trimester will continue into the third. But you’ll experience some new ones too.</p>
      <p>These new symptoms are a result of the baby growing toward its full size before birth. Therefore, it’s occupying more space in your abdomen, which is pressing on your organs and can cause:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Increased urination</li>
        <li>Heartburn</li>
        <li>Trouble sleeping</li>
        <li>Tender breasts</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to alleviate pregnancy symptoms</h3>
      <p>As your body changes and adjusts you may need to change up your daily routine. Here are some ways doctors recommend you alleviate certain symptoms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Walk after a meal to reduce acid reflux and heartburn.</li>
        <li>Eat frequent small meals or take Benadryl to help alleviate vomiting and nausea.</li>
        <li>Prop up your legs to ease swelling in legs, ankles, and feet.</li>
        <li>Go to bed earlier to ease fatigue.</li>
        <li>Sleep on your side to increase comfort as the baby grows.</li>
        <li>Sleep at a slight angle to help reduce pressure on the stomach that can cause acid reflux. “Put one more pillow under the head so that there’s no regurgitation of that acidity,” Vardaka adds.</li>
        <li>Take <a href="https://www.insider.com/is-tylenol-safe-for-pregnancy">Tylenol</a> to relieve aches and pains.</li>
