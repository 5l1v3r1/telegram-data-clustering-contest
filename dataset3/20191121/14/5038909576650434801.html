      <h1>Buyanga wins right to change son's surname </h1>

      <p>© Frank Buyanga has won the right to change the name of his son's surname from that of his mother after the court established that he was the legal father.</p>
      <p>The Children's Court in Harare closed a long running dispute over the child after ruling that his ex-girlfriend Chantelle Muteswa has no right to refuse giving consent to  the registrations of the child's birth registration under his dad's surname.</p>
      <p>Harare magistrate, Stanford Mambanje, ruled that Buyanga must appear on the kids' particulars after the approval from the court that has been granted, and also get a passport which will remain in the custody of the Registrar.</p>
      <p>The dad wanted to change the surname of his child for a number of reasons, including taking his to South Africa this weekend for his baptism.  He said his son got the mother's last name because she lied that she did know who the father was. After it emerged that paternity was not contested, after Buyanga petitioned the court to change the child's last name, the court has decreed the issue of a new birth certificate with the changed name and a new passport.</p>
      <p>The ruling, which was made on Thursday,  means that the son Daniel Sadiqi, will leave for the Christening ceremony with his reverend dad, in South Africa.</p>
      <p>However, the business man will have to obtain consent from his ex-wife before they travel, according to Magistrate Mambanje's ruling. The magistrate ruled that the boy can only travel<br/>outside Zimbabwe with the consent of both parents.</p>
      <p>This comes after a hearing was held to consider arguments from both sides of the dispute.</p>
      <p>Both lawyers for Buyanga and his estranged ex-girlfriend attended the hearing. This comes after magistrates court sitting on July 20 awarded the custody of the minor child to Buyanga.</p>
      <p>Buyanga's attorney advocate Jaqualine Rukanda argued it  is common cause that the paternity<br/>of the child is not disputed"</p>
      <p>The first responded acknowledges the applicant as the biological father of the minor but went on to register his name in her surname,” she said.</p>
      <p>“By doing so, she is denying him his right to family, to his real identity.</p>
      <p>“The advocate said the father has a right to have a say in important decisions involving his child and the baptism ceremony “furthers his right to religion.”</p>
      <p>“There will be no other remedy to the applicant and his son if the baptism is missed,”<br/>Rukanda argued.</p>
      <p>Muteswa’s lawyer Munyaradzi Bwanya claimed it is not within the best interests of the child to give Buyanga permission to take his son for baptism, an assertion rubbished by the magistrate. He said Buyanga was legal father and has custodial rights to make decisions regarding the child.</p>
      <p>The gold and property tycoon has been embroiled in a vicious fight with his ex-girlfriend over “custody and access rights” to their minor child. </p>
      <p>This comes as the 31-year-old ex-girlfriend lost custody of the child after an episode of playing hide and seek with the boy’s travel documents in defiance of a January 2019 court order allowing him to take his child to SA. The court first granted Buyanga the right to be with the child, then has now given him the right to change his child's surname.</p>
      <p>Apart from the custody issue, it seems the parties have also been fighting about where the young boy should be enrolled, with the Johannesburg-based businessman insisting that he goes to Ruzawi Primary School while Muteswa is holding out that he remains at Harare International School.</p>
      <p>Muteswa has attempted to rope in First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa to descend on the businessman and tun the tide on the long-running dispute.</p>
