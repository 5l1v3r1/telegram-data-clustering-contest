      <h1>Predictions on the best Selfridges deals in the Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019 sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:42:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/lela-london/" target="_blank">Lela London</a></address>
      <p>While Selfridges would rather have you believe they don’t participate in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday</a> or Cyber Monday, they run competitor-taunting deals throughout the sales event every year. Only, rather than calling their sale what it is, they market their deals as ‘Christmas Comes Early’.</p>
      <p>In actuality, it’s Black Friday incognito. And it does wonders for the 110-year-old retail giant. Selfridges reported an eight per cent overall sales uplift in the weeks leading up to Christmas last year, contributing to a record sales tally of £1.85bn, year ending February 2019.</p>
      <p>As the retailer would be ill-advised to tinker with a tried and true sales tactic, we expect to see yet another ‘Christmas Comes Early’ event come November 29.</p>
      <p>Best of all, we expect Selfridges’ genre-wide discounts will reduce the price on items you’re unlikely to find at any other Black Friday retailer, making it the perfect place to pick up a super special Christmas gift.</p>
      <p>To help you secure the very <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">best deals</a>, we have gathered intel from previous Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales to help you prepare for the big day:</p>
      <h3>Selfridges Black Friday predictions</h3>
      <p>Whether you’re shopping in your pyjamas (online, presumably), London’s Oxford Street flagship, Birmingham or Manchester, Selfridges is bound to mark down a product with your name on it.</p>
      <p>Typically, the company implements their Christmas Comes Early coupon code (SELFCCE) online to take all the hassle away, offering:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>20 per cent off fashion, jewellery, and home accessories purchases</li>
        <li>10 per cent off beauty, watches, wine, and tech</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The sale generally lasts for three full days (from Black Friday through Cyber Monday) online and offline. Selfridges’ Oxford Street flagship sometimes even sweetens the deal for in-store shoppers. In 2017 they gave away 1000 free tubs of black coconut ice cream at the sale’s launch.</p>
      <p>This year, we expect the percentage off to match last year’s, if not better. Profit margins on fashion, home accessories and beauty are typically above 50 per cent, meaning there is still plenty of room to profit if they discount deeper and drive more sales.</p>
      <p>Though Selfridges has little competition in categories like luxury accessories and fashion, tech - which drives more Black Friday sales than any other genre - is expected to be more aggressively discounted than ever before across all retailers. </p>
      <h3>What to buy from Selfridges over Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2019</h3>
      <p>Selfridges’ decades-earned luxury cred has afforded the brand some very strong relationships with many of the most prestigious brands in the world. Some even make exclusive products, or tailored versions of existing products, specifically for the Selfridges customer.</p>
      <p>Start your Black Friday browse by looking through the ‘Exclusive to Selfridges’ pages in each category, as you are certain to find many of these made-for-gifting products discounted throughout the sales event.</p>
      <p>High-end fashion reigns supreme both in-store and online. Expect huge discounts on chic workwear from Rouland Mouret, embellished Huishan Zhang gowns, Mulberry and Stella McCartney handbags (last year’s 20 per cent off could save you hundreds of pounds this time ‘round), exclusive J Brand jean styles and Valentino rockstuds (the spiked leather courts every brand tries to imitate), and more.</p>

      <p>Just one year ago <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fallsaints-balfern-leather-biker-jacket_930-10136-WL115E%2F%3FpreviewAttribute%3DBlack%26_%24ja%3Dtsid%3A32619%7Cprd%3A86032%26cm_mmc%3DAFFIL-_-AWIN-_-86032-_-0RpXOIXA500%26awc%3D3539_1542980159_0c56f0e6c6d4caf318bfaf707c168535%26utm_source%3DAffiliates%26utm_medium%3D86032%26utm_term%3Dna%26utm_content%3Dna%26utm_campaign%3Dna">All Saints’ Balfern leather biker jacket</a> was reduced from £318 to £222.60, suggesting we’re likely to find a few key investment pieces discounted even more than their category demands this year. </p>
      <p>This extends to jewellery, as well. Watches come in many forms and Selfridges seems to sell them all. At the lower end, you could see 20 per cent off Tissot and Gucci favourites. At the high-end, you should expect the same percentage off for brands like Tag Heuer and Breguet (which, with watches costing £122,900, could secure a monumental saving).</p>
      <p>While many brands will offer their own deals over the Black Friday weekend, the department store’s<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/news/best-black-friday-beauty-deals/"> beauty</a> exclusives are second to none. New additions include Pat McGrath's <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fpat-mcgrath-labs-sublime-perfection-foundation-35ml_1143-3006535-30014178%2F%3FpreviewAttribute%3Dlight2dmedium2d9">sensational wrinkle-fighting foundation</a>, Jo Malone's <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fjo-malone-london-wild-bluebell-hair-mist-30ml_701-10020-L9C9010000%2F">Wild Bluebell hair mist</a>, and YSL's <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fyves-saint-laurent-vernis-lvres-water-stain_456-84033258-LA551400%2F%3FpreviewAttribute%3D609">Vernis A Levres Water Stains</a>. Waiting until Black Friday weekend to purchase could help shoppers make the most of these rare finds.</p>
      <p>Despite tech’s Black Friday deal dominance, most retailers try to beat each other’s prices on a select few products. It’s rare to find deals on niche or cult products. This is where a site-wide sale comes in handy. Selfridges have Snap’s <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fsmartech-snap-nico-spectacles_5161-10212-9000013901%2F">Nico Spectacles</a> and the LARQ <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fsmartech-larq-self-cleaning-bottle-500ml_5161-10212-BDHP050A%2F%3FpreviewAttribute%3Dpink">self-cleaning water bottle</a> for sale, both of which are almost never on offer elsewhere. It's worth keeping an eye on them when the big day arrives, in case they've been discounted.</p>
      <p>On the unfathomably luxurious end of the scale, Selfridges could even offer the likes of Vashi's Lovestrike 18-karat <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fvashi-lovestrike-18k-yellow-gold-18k-white-gold-and-diamond-choker-necklace_5290-10256-CHOKERNECK%2F%3FpreviewAttribute%3D18k2dyellow2dgold">gold and diamond choker</a> (a cool £35,000 RRP) or Royole Moon’s high-tech <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fsmartech-royole-moon-3d-mobile-theatre-headset_5161-10212-RY0102EUN%2F%3FpreviewAttribute%3Dgold">3D headset</a> (normally £749) as part of their Christmas Comes Early promotion. </p>
      <p>If <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fhome-tech%2Fchristmas-shop%2Fadvent-calendars%2F%3Fcm_sp%3DMegaMenu-_-Home_Tech-_-Christmas_shop-Advent_calendars">advent calendars</a> fall into their ‘home accessories’ category (and therefore, into Selfridges' 20 per cent off selection) once again, it may also be worth holding out until the last minute. The online store sells everything from LEGO advent calendars to a luxury porcelain tree advent calendar which presents you with a tiny ornament each day (from Villeroy &amp; Boch) and all, already, offer great value.</p>
