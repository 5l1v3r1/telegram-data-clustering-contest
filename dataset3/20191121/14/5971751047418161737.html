      <p>Nokia 2.2 is a nicely built and affordable entry smartphone. Its price has been reduced additionally in India, and it has now become a bargain. The price of the 2/16GB version is not lowered to 5999 INR, or about â‚¬75. The 3/32Gb version is now set to 6999 INR, which is approximately â‚¬88. The current price of 2.2 brings in question whether it is even necessary to sell feature phones in India. Nokia 2.2 does seem a better choice than Nokia 2720 or Nokia 8110. Nokia Mobile is usually lowering the prices when they are ready to launch a new version of the phone, so Nokia 2.3 might be just around the corner.</p>
