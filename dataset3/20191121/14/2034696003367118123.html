      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/blink-182">Blink-182</a> have teased that a new Christmas song is on the way.</p>
      <p>Speaking to YouTube star Hannah Stocking, drummer Travis Barker revealed that the band have recorded a new effort for the festive season.</p>
      <p>When asked what he’s been listening to recently, Travis shared <i>“…Lil Wayne, and this Christmas song that I just made with my band blink-182.”</i></p>
      <p>He revealed little else, but the timing seems perfect – it’s entirely that it could drop in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>It comes after the band first got back in the festive spirit for 2001’s ‘I Won’t Be Home For Christmas’.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere this year, Blink have been busy on a co-headline tour with Lil Wayne, but it almost hit the buffers when <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-lil-wayne-walk-off-stage-announce-might-quit-blink-182-joint-tour-2527753">Wayne told a crowd in Virginia that “this might be my last night” on the tour.</a></p>

      <p>The incident was eventually played down by the rapper the next day, when he tweeted: “I want all my fans to know I won’t be quitting this tour! I’m having too much fun with my bros blink-182.”</p>
      <p>“He was awesome,” frontman Mark Hoppus told K-ROQ. “He was awesome, his band was amazing, his whole crew, everybody. It was so fun all summer long.”</p>
      <p>They also released their ninth album, the <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/blink-182-nine-review">aptly titled ‘Nine’</a>, in September.</p>
      <p>In a four star review, NME wrote: “There may be no joke songs this time around, but the grinning, reckless abandon of ‘Generational Divide’ is sure to put a smile on the face of the most cynical of fans.</p>
      <p>“The track asks, ‘<i>i</i><i>s it better now,’</i> and somehow, despite everything they’ve been through, yes it is. ‘Nine’ sees Blink back at their very best.”</p>
