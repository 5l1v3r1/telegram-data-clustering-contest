      <p>Amid protest from vegetable vendors, the Vijayapura City Corporation, with the help of the police, launched an operation to remove encroachments on the lane behind Nehru Market here on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The operation started early in the morning with Corporation Commissioner Harsha Shetty, who came with police personnel, including Additional Superintendent of Police B.S. Nemegouda, monitoring it.</p>
      <p>As soon as the eviction drive started with earthmovers being put to use, the vendors began their protest stating that the corporation was harassing them.</p>
      <p>Some of them asked why the corporation was removing their structures, though there was a court stay order on eviction.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Hindu</i>, Mr. Shetty refuted their allegation stating that the court stay order was only for shops inside Nehru Market, while those set up on the either side of the lane were illegal.</p>
      <p>“We are not carrying out any eviction operations inside Nehru Market as we know that the court has given a stay order,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Shetty said that they are only removing encroachments to clear the road since it is a 60-ft road as per records.</p>
      <p>He said that they are removing around 100 shops located on the lane.</p>
      <p>Later, a group of shopkeepers, whose shops were razed, met Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil seeking his help. They said that they set up their shops over two decades ago and now the corporation had removed them without giving them an alternative place to do their business.</p>
      <p>Responding to it, Mr. Patil told them and media persons that tenders had been called for to develop the road; thus removal of encroachments had become essential.</p>
      <p>He said that the district administration held already three rounds of meeting with vendors, which some of them had attended, to inform them about the removal of encroachments.</p>
      <p>With regard to providing an alternative place for vendors, Mr. Patil said that he has directed Mr. Shetty and Mr. Nemegouda to identify a suitable place in the city to accommodate these vendors.</p>
