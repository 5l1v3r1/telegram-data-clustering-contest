      <p>Via <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2019/11/21/antonio-browns-response-to-britney-taylors-lawsuit-focuses-on-a-confidentiality-agreement/">PFT</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“At page 5 of his response to the complaint filed in the state-court proceeding that was initiated on September 10, Brown mentions for the first time that he “executed a confidentiality agreement under duress.” He claims that the confidentiality agreement “precludes him from discussing a number of relevant events.”<br/><br/>“Unless Taylor waives the restrictive requirements of the confidentiality agreement or a Court Order is entered regarding the same, Brown will remain unable to recite these events, which he deems essential to the Court’s understanding of his defense and the counterclaims asserted herein,” Brown explains.<br/><br/>Brown contends that Taylor declined while meeting with NFL investigators to waive the terms of the confidentiality agreement, and Brown asserts that, after the confidentiality agreement is properly addressed, his counterclaim will be amended “to add a count of civil conspiracy naming all at-fault parties.”<br/><br/>The document is again mentioned at page 32, as part of Brown’s counterclaim: “On March 8, 2019 . . . Brown’s legal representative executed a confidentiality agreement under duress, which precludes him from discussing a number of relevant events that have since transpired — all of which relate to the civil conspiracy to extort, defraud, defame and harass Brown.”</blockquote>
      <p>In Taylor’s lawsuit against Brown, she accuses the free agent WR of sexually assaulting her on three different occasions, including a violent rape in 2018.</p>
      <p>Both parties knew each other at Central Michigan before Brown entered the NFL draft in 2010.</p>
      <p>Taylor’s attorney, David Haas, said his client will “not be bullied.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Today, Antonio Brown countersued the woman he raped and blamed her for the self-destructive conduct that led to the demise of his NFL career,” Haas said in a statement. “In the past, Defendant Brown has used intimidation to avoid responsibility for his actions. However, Ms. Taylor will not be bullied and remains steadfast in holding Defendant Brown accountable.”</blockquote>
      <p>Since being traded by the Pittsburgh Steelers — Brown has been released by the Raiders for conduct detrimental to the team, signed to the Patriots, only to be released after one game.</p>
