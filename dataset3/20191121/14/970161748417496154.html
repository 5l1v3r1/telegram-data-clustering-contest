      <p>PewDiePie has slammed claims that he’s transphobic, after misgendering a trans woman in one of his videos.</p>
      <p>The YouTube star – real name Felix Kjellberg – reacted to clips from Dr Phil, including one featuring 19-year-old Bameron.</p>
      <p>Describing her as a ‘Walmart Jeffree Star’, Felix, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/pewdiepie-zedd-bond-banned-china-bizarre-copyright-row-10959920/">who recently claimed his videos are banned in China</a>, used he/him pronouns while watching the clip.</p>
      <p>The comments didn’t pass people by, with some viewers slamming the YouTuber on social media.</p>
      <p>Speaking out in a video, Bameron also took aim at Felix, saying: ‘PewDiePie, I know you’re not out here with 100 million subscribers, with 8000 scandals, misgendering trans people.’</p>

      <p>She added: ‘PewDiePie, f*** you. Thank you for misgendering me on the biggest platform. I’m loving all the hate from your subscribers.’</p>
      <p>Describing the YouTube star as ‘literally a rat,’ she claimed that he must have known her gender from the way she was presenting.</p>

      <p>However, addressing the claims in a video, Felix wasn’t having any of it.</p>
      <p>Responding to criticism on Twitter as opposed to Bameron’s video, he said: ‘If I go on Twitter, this is what I see. These anime avatar kids are relentlessly calling me a transphobe on Twitter.’</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old added: ‘I allegedly purposefully misgendered someone. It was in my Dr Phil video…This person who, to me, was so clearly a Jeffree Star wannabe or lookalike, I didn’t even think about it. She had a masculine name.</p>

      <p>‘It’s not that weird to think they would be referred to as he. She wasn’t mentioned as “she” anywhere in the video so it’s not that weird!’</p>
      <p>PewDiePie went on to say: ‘If [they did] I would have noticed and I would have changed it. But no, I’m a transphobe.’</p>
      <p>He pointed out: ‘I actually support LGBT. I would never – and I could have been more careful – I would never purposefully misgender someone as a way to antagonise or troll. I wouldn’t do that, the same with sexuality.</p>
      <p>‘That’s not okay, you shouldn’t do it either, I wouldn’t do it.’</p>
      <p>Ending the video with some pretty brutal words, he said: ‘It’s the same s*** all over again. Go f*** yourself.’</p>
