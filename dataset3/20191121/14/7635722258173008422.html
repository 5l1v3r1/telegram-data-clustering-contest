        <b>Dublin Airport is trialling a new initiative which will see a dedicated seating and private pod area for passengers who are travelling on their own.</b>
      </p>
      <p>MySpot pods also contain charging facilities and a compartment where hand luggage can be stored.</p>
      <p>The service includes complimentary tea, coffee or water.</p>
      <p>The seat can be reserved from €5 or the pod from €10, depending on availability.</p>
      <p>They are on trial at Gate 103 until mid-December.</p>
      <p>During the trial period, passengers will be greeted by a staff member who will explain the product to them.</p>
      <p>Dublin Airport managing director Vincent Harrison says: "We conduct regular surveys throughout the year with our customers and we know that more than 56% of our passengers travel alone.</p>
      <p>"Solo passengers typically grab a drink and a sandwich and proceed directly to their boarding gate.</p>
      <p>"This group of passengers find it challenging carrying hand luggage and other items such as tea or coffee when travelling alone.</p>
      <blockquote>"The MySpot private seat and pod have been specifically designed to meet the needs of the solo passenger".</blockquote>
      <p>The pod is a bespoke design by Dubliner David O'Coimin, chief executive and founder of the Nook by Do Company.</p>
      <p>If the trial is successful, it will be available at other boarding gates through an online booking system.</p>
      <p>MySpot is one of a number of new projects being developed at the airport under an initiative known as 'The Future Factory', which creates and tests new projects around the airport campus.</p>
      <p>Dublin Airport has welcomed almost 28.4 million passengers in the first 10 months of the year - a 5% increase over the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>Almost 1.4 million extra passengers have travelled through the airport between January and October.</p>
