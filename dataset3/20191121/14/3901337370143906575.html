      <p>The 34-year-old is understood to be weighing up his future in Turin, and would reportedly consider leaving Juventus just two years after his arrival if the Serie A giants fail to win the UEFA Champions League again.</p>
      <p>This is according to Spanish journalist Eduardo Inda, who believes Ronaldo could be looking for a new club at the end of the 2019/20 campaign, and Juventus might be ready to sell.</p>
      <p>"Cristiano Ronaldo could leave Juventus at the end of the current season if they do not win the Champions League," Inda said on television show <i>El Chiringuito de Jugones</i>.</p>
      <p>"He went to Turin to try and win his third Champions League with a different club, but things are getting complicated.</p>

      <p>"Juventus want to sign Paul Pogba and Kylian Mbappe. I think it is going to be difficult for them, especially the second one.</p>
      <p>"Due to the salary limits, if they want to sign these players, they would have to allow for Ronaldo's exit from the club, so it is becoming a very likely outcome."</p>
      <p>Inda also claimed that United would be keen to re-sign Ronaldo if he became available.</p>

      <p>The Portuguese superstar, though, would reportedly also consider other options, including a move to Paris Saint-Germain, Major League Soccer in the US, and his boyhood club Sporting Lisbon.</p>
