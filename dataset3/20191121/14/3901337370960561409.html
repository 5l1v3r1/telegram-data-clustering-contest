      <p>According to Siya sources, Cape Town City have shown interest in a Dutch-based defender.</p>
      <p>The Citizens have previously been on the hunt to bolster their defensive department prior to Benni McCarthy’s departure, with City then snapping up Giannis Potouridis late in October.</p>

      <p>It was no secret that during the previous transfer window that McCarthy was keen to bring Robyn Johannes back to the club, however, with the head coach having since moved on from the club indications are that City are still looking to bolster their defensive set-up.</p>
      <p>The Mother City-based club have conceded 20 league goals so far this season and despite also being the highest scoring team – their defence has cost them some crucial points. </p>
      <p>Siya sources have since revealed to Soccer Laduma that the Mother City-based club is keeping a close eye on Ajax Amsterdam’s youngster, Dean Solomons.</p>
      <p>Solomons came through the ranks of Ajax Cape Town, where in 2017 he joined the Ajax Amsterdam youth structures.</p>
      <p>Siya sources have revealed that the Citizens are monitoring the player, with a view to potentially bring him back to Mzansi.</p>
