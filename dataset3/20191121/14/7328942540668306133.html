      <h1>Physicists May Have Discovered More Evidence on New Force of Nature</h1>
      <h2>The discovery from the Hungarian lab could help unravel the mystery of dark matter.</h2>

      <p>To this day, physicists have discovered four known forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and the weak nuclear force. </p>
      <p>Now, scientists from Hungary claim to have found a <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-claim-a-they-ve-found-even-more-evidence-of-a-new-force-of-nature"><b>fifth force</b></a> emerging from a helium atom. This discovery could help unravel the mystery of dark matter. </p>
      <p>The findings have been published in pre-print server <i><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10459">arXiv</a>, </i>but are still waiting to be peer reviewed.</p>

      <h4>This is not the first time physicists think they've found a new force</h4>
      <p>In 2016, scientists from Hungary's<a href="http://w3.atomki.hu/index_en.html"> Institute for Nuclear Research</a>, or Atomki, published a paper in the journal <i><a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.042501">Physical Review Letters</a></i>, with details of their evidence that a previously unknown force was part of the radioactive decay of the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2223860-physicists-see-new-hints-of-a-fifth-force-of-nature-hidden-in-helium/">beryllium-8 isotope</a>.</p>

      <p>Now, some of the same scientists from Atomki have published their new findings of a potential fifth force of nature. Researcher <a href="https://www.atomki.hu/users/view/16">Attila Krasznahorkay</a>, who was also part of the 2016 findings, and his team were the ones to make the new discovery.</p>
      <p>Their findings carry on from the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/physicists-discover-evidence-fifth-force-nature">2016 discovery</a>. The team believes to have seen a second example of the mysterious force at play, as well as the particle they believe to be carrying it, they're calling it <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-claim-a-they-ve-found-even-more-evidence-of-a-new-force-of-nature">X17</a>.</p>

      <p>The team found pairs of electrons and positrons separating at a specific angle of <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-claim-a-they-ve-found-even-more-evidence-of-a-new-force-of-nature"><b>115 degrees</b></a>, this angle doesn't match currently accepted models. </p>

      <p>The X17 particle is a long way from being an official particle. Following thorough peer review though, if this discovery becomes confirmed, X17 could help us better understand the forces that govern our Universe. </p>
