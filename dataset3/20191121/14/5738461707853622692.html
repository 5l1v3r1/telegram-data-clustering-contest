      <p>Dundalk's Andrea Corr has won an award for her new book at the An Post Irish Book Awards which were held in Dublin’s Convention Centre last night.</p>
      <p>The Corrs singer's memoirs Barefoot Pilgrammage won the Ireland AM Popular Non-Fiction Book of the Year. </p>
      <p>Barefoot Pilgrimage is described as ''a compelling and honest memoir. In part, it is an exercise in coming to terms with and making sense of life and mortality following the loss of a beloved father; in part, a reflection on an unlikely journey with her siblings through the music industry; in part, a meditation on family, on music, and on creativity; and, in part, a shout-out for love and for hope. </p>
      <p>''Illustrated with personal photographs and with original poems interspersed throughout the text, this is a very personal - at times very funny, at times deeply moving - book from an iconic figure in popular music.''</p>
      <p>Highlights of the Irish Book Awards will be shown on RTÉ One at 11.15pm this Saturday.</p>
