      <h1>Trump administration official demands $15B from South Korea, report says</h1>

      <p>Nov. 21 (UPI) -- The Trump administration is asking South Korea to pay as much as $15 billion for the costs of maintaining U.S. troops on and beyond the peninsula, according to a South Korean press report.</p>
      <p>Local television network JTBC reported Thursday U.S. State Department negotiator James DeHart recently met with Yoon Sang-hyun, chairman of South Korean parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
      <p>Yoon told the network DeHart said U.S. troops would cost as much as $15 billion, a staggering number that was not supported by detailed analyses, according to the report.</p>
      <p>South Korea currently pays nearly $1 billion annually for keeping 28,500 troops on the peninsula. The new number surpasses the $5 billion the Trump administration has demanded Seoul pay for costs beyond Korea's borders.</p>
      <p>Yoon said DeHart mentioned the cost of undertaking reconnaissance missions, deploying missiles and maintaining a security umbrella beyond the peninsula is "two, three times" the $5 billion amount.</p>
      <p>DeHart recently ended negotiations early, raising uneasiness in Seoul. The tactics have been followed by a report from local paper Chosun Ilbo the United States is prepared to withdraw between 4,000 to 5,000 troops, or a brigade, from the peninsula.</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Mark-Esper/?tps=1">Mark Esper</a> has denied the claim about troop withdrawal. The Pentagon has called for the report's retraction -- describing the article as "irresponsible," according to South Korean television network SBS.</p>
      <p>"I'm always reading articles in the media that are false or inaccurate, or overstated," Esper said. "We are not threatening allies over this."</p>
      <p>South Korean lawmakers are in Washington this week to meet with members of U.S. Congress.</p>
      <p>Oh Shin-hwan of the center-right Bareun Mirae Party said U.S. lawmakers including Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., agreed the cost-sharing demands are "excessive," while Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, reportedly said a resolution considering withdrawal could be proposed if GSOMIA, a military intelligence-sharing agreement between Seoul and Tokyo, is not renewed.</p>
      <p>The deal expires on Saturday. Seoul has yet to make a final decision, citing lack of Japanese cooperation on lifting trade penalties.</p>
