      <p>Toby Booth has joined <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins">Harlequins</a> for the remainder of this season three weeks after the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/surprise-development-at-harlequins-as-codling-exits-just-two-games-into-new-league-season/">Londoners left go forwards coach Alex Codling</a>.</p>
      <p>Harlequins, who have started the season shakily with just one win in four in the Premiership and a huge loss at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/clermont">Clermont</a> in Europe, have snapped up Booth who has been at a loose end since leaving <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/bath">Bath</a> last summer after being with them since 2012.</p>
      <p>Prior to Bath, he has senior roles at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/london-irish">London Irish</a> whom he joined in 2004 and worked with for eight years.</p>
      <p>“When the opportunity came up to join Harlequins, it was an exciting prospect that I knew I had to take,” explained 49-year-old Booth, whose recruitment comes ahead of this weekend’s European fixture against his old club Bath.   </p>

      <p>“Quins are a side full of rich talent and international experience. The pack contains some exciting players. It is an ambitious group and has good potential to improve. Having developed players throughout my career I look forward to adding value to this squad of players and developing their performances on the pitch.”</p>
      <p>Harlequins boss Paul Gustard added: “I have known Toby personally for a long time and he is a coach who will add tremendous value to our whole group. He has a successful record of developing players and teams and we cannot wait for him to start.</p>

      <p>“His main remit will be our lineout, but I know he will also have a significant impact on the wider programme and will prove to be an outstanding resource for not only myself but our young and talented coaching group.</p>
      <p>“He is a great guy with good values and someone who had a big impact on my personal coaching pedagogy early in my career. His signing is a great boost for the club and we look forward to seeing the impact he will quickly make.”</p>
