      <h1>World Chess announces plans for ‘hybrid IPO’</h1>
      <h2>Company that markets World Chess Championship intends to list on UK’s Aim in 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:43:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:43</time> by <a rel="author">Hannah Murphy, Tim Bradshaw</a></address>
      <p>World Chess has announced plans for a novel “hybrid initial public offering”, where it will raise funds by first issuing a digital token before floating on London's junior stock market next year, as it ramps up efforts to commercialise the age-old board game.</p>
      <p>Ilya Merenzon, chief executive of the company that was responsible for the World Chess Championship until 2018 but now only holds some commercial rights to the tournament, told the Financial Times that the group intended to list on the UK’s Aim market in 2020. </p>
      <p>Before then, however, World Chess will issue so-called security tokens — a digital representation of equity — at “hundreds of dollars” apiece using blockchain technology, he said.</p>
      <p>Despite having a fanatical following, chess has long been a cash-strapped industry and has failed to modernise where online gaming has otherwise taken off. Indeed, for decades, the sport has been financially dependent on rich backers in Russia and former Soviet states. </p>
      <p>World Chess in particular has come under threat as the body that controls all the major tournaments, the World Chess Federation (FIDE), is busy taking many of the rights back. </p>
      <p>At a time when corporate borrowing costs are low, the token offering could be a risky manoeuvre. Many private investors were burnt by a series of so-called <a href="https://www.ft.com/initial-coin-offerings">initial coin offerings</a> in recent years, which left them holding worthless digital tokens. In 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warned that ICOs were “very high-risk, speculative investments” with potential for fraud.</p>
      <p>As part of the so-called “pre-IPO”, due to launch by next week, World Chess aims to raise “in the low numbers of millions of dollars” by selling around 4 to 6 per cent of the company to qualified investors in the US and EU, said Mr Merenzon.</p>
      <p>“It will enable us to prepare for public listing, and is a simpler way to bring in investors without having to go through [the] relatively cumbersome procedure of selling equity,” he said. </p>
      <p>In response to the fraudulent ICOs of recent years, many of which were structured to evade securities laws, regulators have increasingly clamped down on the space. As a result, some companies have explored compliant ways of raising funds without using traditional exchanges. World Chess’ pre-IPO is one such offering, Mr Merenzon said, adding that all investors will be subject to “relatively advanced” know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks via a third party.</p>
      <p>Investors will be able to convert the security tokens into potentially more liquid shares when the Aim listing has taken place, he added. </p>
      <p>Mr Merenzon said the majority of the funds raised would go towards helping to support chess as an e-sport — including the development of an online championship platform as well as anti-cheating software for monitoring online matches. </p>
      <p>World Chess will use the blockchain technology of Boston-based Algorand, a start-up that was approached by Facebook as part of the social media’s high-profile plans to launch its own digital coin, Libra. An acquisition never took place, however, after talks fell through. </p>
      <p>World Chess is currently breaking even following a period of investment, Mr Merenzon said. According to Crunchbase, it raised $6m in its latest funding round in May from venture firm Prytek and Russian billionaire and co-owner of Technonicol, Igor Rybakov.</p>
