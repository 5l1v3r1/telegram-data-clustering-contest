      <p>Kogi state governor Yahaya Bello and his deputy-elect Edward Onoja have been issued their certificate of return by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Lokoja.</p>
      <p>Bello, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/apcs-yahaya-bello-re-elected-kogi-governor-for-second-term/">re-elected for a second term</a> after Saturday, November 16 election.</p>
      <p>The returning officer for the election and vice-chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria, Professor Ibrahim Umar, announced the result at the INEC office in Lokoja on Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>Bello won 12 local governments to beat his major challenger Musa Wada of People’s Democratic Party (PDP) who won 9 local governments.</p>
      <p>In total, Umar said Bello polled 406,222 votes. Wada polled 189,704. The governorship candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) Natasha Akpoti polled 9482 votes to come third.</p>
      <p>“This victory is for Kogi people that value true democracy,” Bello said after the election result was announced.</p>
      <p>“We thank Kogites who voted for us. We also thank Kogi people who did not vote for us; they have challenged the governor to do more for them to earn their confidence.”</p>
      <p>Bello’s description of the election contradicts the view of his closest contestants- Wadda of the PDP and SDP’s Akpoti.</p>
      <p>Both opposition candidates rejected the governorship election result.</p>
      <p>“They (Kogi people) should not despair,” Wada said in a video tweeted by the PDP.</p>
      <p>The PDP candidate said the announced results were fabricated and he will <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/kogi-pdps-wada-dissatisfied-to-appeal-election-result-at-tribunal/">challenge the outcome in court</a>.</p>
      <p>SDP candidate Akpoti said the election results did not represent how the people voted.</p>
      <p>Akpoti accused APC and winner of the election Yahaya Bello of <a href="https://guardian.ng/news/sdp-candidate-akpoti-accuses-yahaya-bello-of-disrupting-election-with-thugs/">using violence to subvert the will of the people</a>.</p>
      <p>The returning officer noted that a total of 1,646,350 people registered for the election while 636,202 were accredited to vote.</p>
      <p>He explained that the margin between Bello and the runner-up Wadda was 216,518 votes.</p>
