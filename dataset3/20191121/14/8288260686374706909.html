      <h1>Male birth control which is injected into penis could be available in UK in 2020</h1>
      <h2>It has just successfully completed a clinical trial at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:31:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Shivali Best, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>A male birth control that's injected into the penis could be available within just seven months.</p>
      <p>The birth control is injected directly into the penis where it effectively blocks sperm from leaving the testicles.</p>
      <p>It has just successfully completed a clinical trial at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).</p>
      <p>Speaking to  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/hindustan-times-ltd">Hindustan Times</a> , Dr R.S Sharma, a senior scientist with the ICMR, said: “The product is ready, with only regulatory approvals pending [from the government].</p>
      <p>“The trials are over, including extended, Phase 3 clinical trials for which 303 candidates were recruited with a 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects. The product can safely be called the world’s first male contraceptive.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Professor S.K Guha, a scientist from the Indian Institute of Technology, said: “The polymer was developed by Professor S.K. Guha from the Indian Institute of Technology in the 1970s. ICMR has been researching on it to turn it into a product for mass use since 1984, and the final product is ready after exhaustive trials.”</p>
      <p>The researchers suggest that the product will be available within the next seven months, although it seems many men are sceptical of male birth controls.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A recent survey by YouGov revealed only one in three men would be willing to take male birth control, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/science/male-birth-control-thats-injected-20920090?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=mirror_main">reports the Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>However, the injection isn’t the only male birth control in the works.</p>
