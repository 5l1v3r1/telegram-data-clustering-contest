      <h1>Employment laws coming into force in 2019 - including the right to a contract</h1>
      <h2>With the Government mired in the complications of Brexit, a number of employment law changes, including the new minimum wage, have been placed on hold. However, there there are still some important changes that workers need to know about</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:17:55+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>A number of new employment laws to protect workers from law-breaking bosses will kick in next year in a win for employees all over the country.</p>
      <p>In April, several announcements will take effect on the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/important-employment-laws-kick-next-14162208">back of new sick pay rules and the legal right to a payslip this year</a>.</p>
      <p>It will mean every worker gets an itemised contract for the first time ever in the UK, while agency workers will get better pay after 12 weeks, marking the end of Swedish derogation contracts.</p>
      <p>Other changes will affect those who require bereavement leave, while more than 2.4million will see their wages go up - although these rates are yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Here's what you need to know before April 2020.</p>
      <h3>1. Changes to contracts </h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The law around employee contracts will change on April 6, 2020, meaning contracts will become a day one right for all workers.</p>
      <p>Contracts will also need to contain additional details for the first time, including entitlement to family-friendly leave, clarification of any probationary periods and confirmation of which specific days and times individuals are required to work.</p>
      <p>These contracts will also need to detail:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the hours and days of the week the worker/employee is required to work, whether they may be varied and how</li>
        <li>entitlements to any paid leave</li>
        <li>any other benefits not covered elsewhere in the written statement</li>
        <li>details of any probationary period</li>
        <li>details of training provided by the employer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2. Extension of holiday pay reference period </h3>
      <p>The holiday pay reference period, which is used to calculate the average pay of those who work irregular hours, will be extended from 12 to 52 weeks on April 6, 2020.</p>
      <p>Employers will need to keep track of employees' working time throughout the year, including overtime to ensure they get the right leave.</p>
      <h3>3. End of Swedish derogation contracts</h3>
      <p>Employers will no longer be able to make use of Swedish derogation contracts from April 6, 2020.</p>
      <p>These contracts, which allow employers to avoid paying agency workers equal pay after 12 weeks', will become illegal.</p>
      <h3>4. Change to statutory rates</h3>
      <p>The minimum rates on offer for statutory entitlements such as maternity pay, paternity pay and sick pay will also be reviewed in April 2020.</p>
      <p>Much like the National Minimum Wage, these amounts typically increase each year, and any subsequent announcements are likely to require employers to amend their approach.</p>
      <h3>5. Parental bereavement leave </h3>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The right to <a href="https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/parental-bereavement-pay-and-leave-act-2018/">parental bereavement leave will become effective in April 2020</a> .</p>
      <p>Although the government is yet to confirm an exact date, we know that qualifying parents will be entitled to two weeks of paid bereavement leave following the death of a child under the age of 18 to help with the grieving process.</p>
      <p>This will also include those who experience a stillbirth after 24 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
