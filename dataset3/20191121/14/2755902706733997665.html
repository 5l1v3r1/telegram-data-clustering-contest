      <p>Below is video footage captured during<a href="https://iharare.com/amai-sorobhi-appeals-for-help/"> iHarare’s visit to veteran television actress Rhoda Mtembe,</a> popularly known as Amai Sorobhi, who is appealing for help from well-wishers.</p>
      <p>Gogo Mtembe suffered a stroke early this year and is now handicapped. She is barely able to walk on her own or to perform day to day tasks. She is currently living with her daughter Charity who is taking care of her every need, including moving her around the house when she needs to.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://iharare.com/yesteryear-actress-mai-sorobhi-struggling/">yesterday’s article on Gogo Mtembi’s plight</a>, iHarare has been receiving numerous calls and inquiries from well-wishers from all over the world, who want to assist the veteran actress and wanted to confirm the channels through which to send their aid.</p>
