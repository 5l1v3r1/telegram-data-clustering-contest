      <p>Thinking about getting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-borderlands-3-564978.phtml"><i>Borderlands 3</i></a>? Now's the time. Gearbox is running a free-weekend event for <i>Borderlands 3</i> through Sunday, November 24. Think of all the loot you can amass!</p>

      <p><i>Borderlands 3 </i>is temporarily free to play on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1001-CUSA07823_00-000000000OAKSIEA">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/borderlands-3/c34nb0f1b5wq?ocid=xboxcompdp&amp;locale=en-US&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Xbox One</a> – follow those links to hit up the store pages, and sorry, PC players – but there is fine print. On Xbox One, you'll need either an Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, and on PS4, you'll need PlayStation Plus for online multiplayer. If you're worried about a looming data cap, the game's around 40GB, give or take.</p>
      <p>The <i>Borderlands 3 </i>free weekend ends on November 24 at 11:59pm Pacific for Xbox One players, and November 25 at 9:00am Pacific for PlayStation 4 users. Gearbox currently also has a deal on the Xbox One version of <i>BL3</i> – Gold subscribers can nab it for $40.19 – with more discounts to come soon.</p>
      <p>Hearing about <i>Borderlands 3</i>'s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../borderlands-3-s-first-takedown-raid-also-cranks-up-the-amount-of-loot-you-can-stash-572989.phtml">update and DLC plans</a> yesterday reminded me that yeah, I probably <i>should </i>try this game before the year is over. I'm semi-curious (more for the grind than anything to do with the story or characters, to be honest), but I haven't made it a priority yet. Busy times! From what I've seen around the community, plenty of you are having a ball watching those numbers pop.</p>
      <p>I'm definitely going with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../borderlands-3-guide-if-you-re-playing-solo-consider-fl4k-565692.phtml">FL4K</a>, though. That's decided.</p>
