        <b>A planning application has been submitted for the development of the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland (NMIS), near Glasgow airport at the Advanced Manufacturing Innovation District Scotland (AMIDS).</b>

      <p>NMIS is a £65m centre, led by Scottish Government (which contributed £48m) in partnership with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Scottish Enterprise</li>
        <li>Highlands and Islands Enterprise</li>
        <li>Skills Development Scotland</li>
        <li>Scottish Funding Council</li>
        <li>University of Strathclyde (contributed £8m)</li>
        <li>Renfrewshire Council</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Operated by the University as a national facility for Scotland, the plan is for research, industry and the public sector to “work together to transform skills, productivity and innovation to attract investment and make Scotland a global leader in advanced manufacturing”, according to NMIS.</p>
      <p>“Scotland has a vibrant manufacturing sector,” said Strathclyde University head Professor Sir Jim McDonald. “To achieve its fullest potential, it needs advanced facilities, resources and equipment, for use by highly qualified and skilled staff: NMIS will offer all of this.”</p>

      <p>NMIS will include a skills academy, a ‘digitalised factory of the future’ and collaboration hub for manufacturers of all sizes and from all sectors to work together with research partners and the public sector, it said. It is also intended to be carbon-neutral.</p>
      <p>Together with the the Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre, in which the University of Strathclyde is also lead research partner, NMIS will be the anchor institutions in AMIDS – the advanced manufacturing district mentioned above – which is getting £39m for infrastructure from the Glasgow City Region City Deal. The medicines centre is a collaboration between CPI (the UK Government’s Centre for Process Innovation), University of Strathclyde, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), Scottish Enterprise, and founding industry partners AstraZeneca and GSK.</p>
      <p>AMIDS is led by Renfrewshire Council in partnership with Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Government. At its heart is Netherton Campus, which is the 52-hectare site next to Glasgow Airport – with space for up to 1.6m square feet of commercial floor space – where NMIS and the medicines centre will be built.</p>
      <p>Adjacent to the Netherton Campus (are you still with me dear reader?) are two established business parks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Westway – home to the Lightweight Manufacturing Centre (LMC)</li>
        <li>Inchinnan – home to Strathclyde’s Advanced Forming Research Centre (AFRC – a UK high-value manufacturing Catapult) which is a base for engineering, research and life science companies</li>
      </ul>
