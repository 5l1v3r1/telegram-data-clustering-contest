      <p>Savvy shoppers, unite! <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday 2019</a> is just around the corner and, if the last couple of years are anything to go by, we’re about to be inundated with unbelievable beauty deals.</p>
      <p>Whether there’s a palette you’ve had your eyes on for months or a skincare regime you’ve been saving up to splurge on, the sales event is expected to have something for everyone. Hair products, moisturisers, and make-up are all a dime a dozen from Black Friday through Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>Much to the delight of Christmas shoppers, some of the very best deals are actually offered on the most expensive beauty products, like beauty tools, fragrances, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/events/best-beauty-advent-calendars-2019-charlotte-tilbury-jo-malone-elemis/">beauty advent calendars</a>.</p>
      <p>To help you prepare your wishlist in the run up to November 29 – beyond the obvious selection of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/beauty/events/stella-smart-beauty-awards-2019-reveal-15-winning-beauty-products/">Stella Smart Beauty award winners</a>, that is – we have gone through the biggest and best Black Friday beauty deals from previous years and the industry rumours circulating for 2019’s. </p>
      <h3>Predictions on the best Black Friday beauty deals of 2019</h3>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, it’s safe to assume most major beauty brands and retailers will take around 15% off their products’ retail price.</p>
      <p>This has been the case for the last few years of Black Friday beauty deals, and the only real exception tends to be when the discount is even bigger.</p>
      <p>For example, self proclaimed NARSissists were treated to 20% off all products, including cult classics and new launches, at NARS boutiques and narscosmetics.co.uk  for three full days last year.</p>
      <p>Upping the ante, Kat Von D’s Shade + Light Glimmer Eye Palette was even reduced to £22, taking £15 off its regular retail price, for five full days on either side of Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Cult brands like Glossier (which offered a site-wide 20% discount in 2018) take advantage of the sales event to get their products in front of new customers, but high street brands love to get involved, too. <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2041&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.boots.com%2F">Boots</a>, <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3539&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.selfridges.com%2FGB%2Fen%2Fcat%2Fbeauty%2F%3Fcm_sp%3DMegaMenu-_-Beauty-_-AllBeauty">Selfridges</a>, and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2026&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.superdrug.com%2F">Superdrug</a> have all offered brilliant deals across affordable and luxury products in recent years, while companies like The Body Shop have urged their customers towards their website - rather than in-store - by offering an incredible 40% discount.</p>
      <p>Not sure what you’re looking for but know you’d  like to try out a hero product or two? You’re in luck. Giorgio Armani treated us to 30% off of everything from their legendary foundation, Luminous Silk, to their gorgeous liquid Lip Maestro collection. Similarly, Charlotte Tilbury’s Black Friday deals were among the very best and beauty lovers rushed to snap up her gift sets, hero products, and signature perfume - <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=INH%2FSVPJb1Y&amp;mid=40203&amp;u1=customid&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlottetilbury.com%2Fuk%2Fproduct%2Fscent-of-a-dream-perfume-100ml">Scent of a Dream</a> - at half price.</p>

      <p>We expect most brands in the industry will clamour for our attention on Black Friday. Celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin’s hair care line, OUAI, was a great example of this last year – its products were buy one-get-one-free through Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Even pregnancy beauty brand of choice, Mama Mio, took 25% off its products, including the skin expert-acclaimed <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6507&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mioskincare.co.uk%2Fmama-mio-the-tummy-rub-butter-120g%2F11098394.html">Tummy Rub Butter</a> and 30% off <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6507&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mioskincare.co.uk%2Felysium.search%3Fsearch%3Dtrimester">Trimester Bundles</a>.  </p>
      <p>This year, rumours are circulating that notoriously luxe skincare brand La Mer are whipping up something special for Black Friday, suggesting we may see the inimitable <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=INH%2FSVPJb1Y&amp;mid=40724&amp;u1=customid&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cremedelamer.co.uk%2Fproduct%2F5834%2F12343%2Fmoisturisers%2Fcreme-de-la-mer%2Fmoisturiser-for-dry-skin%23%2Fsku%2F26766">Crème de la Mer</a> for less than £200.</p>
      <p>Multi-brand retailer <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2082&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lookfantastic.com%2F">Lookfantastic </a>has also put its promotional wheels in motion, promoting upcoming deals with the hashtag #LFBlackFriday, and many beloved beauty brands - like Estee Lauder - have launched Black Friday countdowns on their respective websites.</p>
      <p>One of the only brands to confirm its deals at this point is Aveda, who will be offering 20% off across everything on Black Friday. This will be music to the ears of natural beauty-loving Christmas shoppers, in particular, as gift sets like the  Cherry almond vegan hair collection (worth £49), will only cost £28. </p>

      <p>Lastly, keep an eye out for beauty tools like GHD straighteners (the<a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=2526&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ghdhair.com%2Fghd-iv-styler-collection%2Fghd-iv-styler"> Original Styler</a> is often around 30% off), electric toothbrushes (the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Oral-B-CrossAction-Toothbrush-Rechargeable-Connected/dp/B01DY36X6Y?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Oral-B Genius 9000</a> was reduced from £300 to £99.99 at Boots in 2018), and at-home IPLs — Philips regularly offer 60% off its products on Black Friday, which makes IPLs like the powerful <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=73846&amp;clickref=customid&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fphilips-lumea-prestige-ipl-hair-remover%2Fp3957694%3Fsku%3D237948416%26s_kwcid%3D2dx92700046910323913%26tmad%3Dc%26tmcampid%3D2%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMI8pTx0OCt5QIV1ed3Ch2iYQVrEAQYAyABEgKv3fD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds">Lumea Prestige</a> absurdly affordable.</p>
