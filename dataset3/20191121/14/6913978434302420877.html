      <p><b>COLOMBO —</b> Sri Lanka's divisive Rajapaksa clan consolidated their grip on power on Thursday as newly elected President Gotabaya Rajapaksa swore in his brother Mahinda as prime minister.<br/><br/>The siblings are credited with destroying in brutal fashion ethnic Tamil separatists to end Sri Lanka's civil war a decade ago when Mahinda was president and Gotabaya effectively ran the security forces.<br/><br/>Mahinda, the elder and more charismatic of the brothers, was unable to run for president, having already served the maximum of two terms between 2005 and 2015.<br/><br/>Thursday's nationally televised brief ceremony — held deliberately at an astrologically auspicious time — came after Ranil Wickremesinghe stepped down in the wake of Saturday's election.<br/><br/>Gotabaya, 70, was elected president on Saturday thanks to his popularity among the Sinhalese-Buddhist majority, thrashing his main moderate rival despite support from minority Tamils and Muslims.<br/><br/>He campaigned with promises to make the island of 21.6 million people safe in the wake of suicide bombings by homegrown extremists in April that killed 269 people.<br/><br/>Mahinda was also prime minister twice between 2004 and 2005 and again for 52 days during last year's political crisis before the Supreme Court ruled his appointment unconstitutional.<br/><br/>Official sources said the 74-year-old Mahinda would name his cabinet on Friday. He will likely head a minority government and elections cannot be held before March.<br/><br/>Around 40,000 Tamil civilians were allegedly killed by the military in 2009 but the Rajapaksas have denied allegations of war crimes and resisted pressure for an international probe.<br/><br/>During Mahinda's 2005-15 presidency, Sri Lanka also moved closer to China, borrowing almost $7 billion for infrastructure projects — many of which turned into white elephants mired in corruption.<br/><br/>Two other Rajapaksa brothers, Basil and Chamal, are also active in politics. Basil is also credited with leading Gotabaya's election campaign while Chamal is a member of parliament and a former speaker. — AFP</p>
