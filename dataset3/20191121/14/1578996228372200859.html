      <h1>Camila Cabello Recounts Her and Shawn Mendes' Years-Long Love Story</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:51:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:51</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Gather 'round, it's storytime: Camila Cabello laid out her and Shawn Mendes' full, years-long romantic history to <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/camila-cabello-interview-romance-shawn-mendes-912838/">Rolling Stone</a> </i>in the outlet's new interview with her. She acknowledged that back in 2015, when the two worked on and released "I Know What You Did Last Summer," there were sparks between them. But they wouldn't act on them until 2019.</p>
      <p><i>Rolling Stone </i>asked when Cabello and Mendes' friendship became romantic. Cabello responded:</p>
      <blockquote>During “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” I really bonded with him as more than a friend. I think he did, too, but we were both really young, and he was experiencing the pressures of his career. I don’t think we knew what to do with those feelings. It was this awkward thing where we both liked each other, but we weren’t together. It was just weird. An energy was there from the beginning, but after that song, we didn’t spend as much time together. Our paths just didn’t cross in that way romantically until we started hanging out again and writing. For me, it just brought it back.</blockquote>
      <p>In 2018, Cabello and Mendes were writing "Señorita," which came out earlier this year and was recently nominated for a Grammy. Cabello spoke to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1071136/camila-cabello-reveals-she-had-drifted-from-shawn-mendes-before-senorita?query=shawn%20mendes">E!</a> in September at ELLE's Women in Music event about how they reconnected during that process.</p>
      <p>"We went back and forth for eight months deciding whether or not we were going to do the song together," Cabello started. They shot the music video shortly after they recorded the song.</p>
      <p>"I love him with all my heart and always have," she told the outlet. "We've known each other for a really long time…We've always been there for each other. I think we drifted because we weren't hanging out as as much. It was fun to be able to reconnect and hang out again." And from there, their romance blossomed for real this time.</p>
