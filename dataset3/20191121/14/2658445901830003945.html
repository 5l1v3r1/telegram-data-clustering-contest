      <p>Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has said that he can’t disobey court orders on issuance of fresh proclamation for the Edo State House of Assembly.</p>
      <p>Governor Obaseki was responding to comments by Peter Akpatason purportedly on behalf of Edo Caucus in the National Assembly that he (Obaseki) should issue fresh proclamation letter for the Edo Assembly to be properly inaugurated.</p>
      <p>Obaseki, however said, he has reached out to some members of the Edo State caucus at the National Assembly, whose names were listed in the said statement and they denounced the statement denying knowledge of any meeting.</p>
      <p>Speaking through his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, Governor Obaseki said he reached out to Senator Francis Alimikhena, representing Edo North Senatorial District, Hon. Dennis Idahosa, representing Ovia Federal Constituency and Hon. Patrick Aisowerien, representing Orhionmwon Federal Constituency.</p>
      <p>According to him, “We believe the said statement is a product from the stables of the media aides of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, who are hell-bent on spewing falsehoods and propagating alternative facts to hoodwink the public. The statement should therefore be disregarded in its entirety.</p>
      <p>“As regards the issuance of a fresh proclamation, we want to draw the attention of all Nigerians to the judgement by the Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt on the case with Suit Number FHC/PH/CS/159/2019, filed by the Deputy Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Hon. Yekini Idiaye and member representing Ikpoba-Okha Constituency, Hon. Henry Okuarobo, on the issue of the issuance of a fresh proclamation for the inauguration of the 7th Edo State House of Assembly.</p>

      <p>“The court had ruled that: “The Plaintiffs/Applicants are granted an order of interim injunction restraining the 6th Defendant/Respondent (the Governor of Edo State) from issuing any fresh proclamation for the holding of another first session for the Edo State House of Assembly pending the hearing and the determination of the substantive suit”.</p>
      <p>“With the judgement, the issue of issuance of a fresh proclamation was laid to rest, giving impetus for the genuinely inaugurated 7th Assembly in Edo State to continue proceedings as a legally-constituted legislative arm of government in Edo State.</p>
      <p>“Requests for the Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki to issue a fresh proclamation letter is tantamount to asking the governor to disobey the court order.”</p>
