      <h1>Killer of Helen McCourt free to walk streets despite never telling family where her body is</h1>
      <h2>Murderer Ian Simms, who was a pub landlord, has been granted parole</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:05:19+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/steve-graves/" target="_blank">Steve Graves</a></address>
      <p>A pub landlord who killed a young woman after she got off a bus near her home is free to walk the streets - despite never revealing where her body is.</p>
      <p>Ian Simms abducted and murdered insurance clerk Helen McCourt, 22, in 1988.</p>
      <p>He has never told police where he disposed of her body despite her family repeatedly appealing for him to do so.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Simms, the landlord of a pub then called the George and Dragon in Billinge, was convicted of Helen's murder in 1989 and was given a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/helen-mccourt-simms-killer-prison-10831854">life sentence with a minimum tariff of 16 years</a>.</p>
      <p>Helen's mum Marie led a long campaign for the introduction of a 'Helen's Law' in her daughter's name, which would mean killers would have to disclose the whereabouts of their victim's remains before being considered for parole.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/breaking-helen-mccourts-killer-released-20929252">the Mirror reports</a> Simms, who has never revealed where Helen's remains are, has been granted parole after a hearing earlier this month.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the Parole Board said:  “The Parole Board must make its decisions solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release.</p>

      <p>"The panel will have carefully looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change.</p>
      <p>“This is done with great care and public safety is the number one priority.”</p>
      <p>One of the first UK cases to be solved using DNA, Simms was convicted after he was found with blood on his clothes which matched that of Helen’s parents, and her opal and sapphire earring was found in his car.</p>
      <p>His bloodstained clothes were recovered from banks of a river, and a knotted strangling flex discovered nearby had teeth marks in it, matching those of the landlord’s dog and hairs identical to Helen’s caught in it.</p>
      <p>In the last three months, Marie has started a fresh search for her daughter, with new suggestions she could be in Rixton clay pits, in nearby Warrington, 15 miles from Helen's home in Billinge, in a 200m zone, where Simms held a fishing license in another man’s name.</p>

      <h4>What is a life sentence?</h4>
      <p>People often complain that, in terms of UK sentencing laws, life doesn't mean life.</p>
      <p>But if that is the case what does it means to get a life sentence?</p>
      <p>A life sentence means a convicted criminal will remain on licence permanently and can only apply for parole after serving a minimum term set by the judge.</p>
      <p>But they will only ever set foot in the community if a parole board deems they no longer pose a risk to the public.</p>
      <p>As an example the starting minimum term for someone who has committed a murder with a knife is 25 years, although this can be adjusted up and down by circumstances.</p>
      <p>Many people who are set a minimum term will still not be released, because they are still considered dangerous. Moors murderer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors_murders#Ian_Brady">Myra Hindley</a> was one such prisoner who died in jail.</p>
      <p>The average jail term served by a prisoner on a life sentence in England and Wales is 15 years according to the Sentencing Council.</p>
      <p>The minimum term sets life sentences aside from standard determinate sentences in which prisoners are expected to serve around one half of their sentence in prison and the rest on licence, or two thirds and having to go before a parole board if they are considered dangerous and given an extended sentence.  </p>
      <p>There are situations where life literally does mean life. They are called <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/liverpool-life-prison-sentences-listed-14839537">whole life tarrifs</a> and are very rarely handed out by judges, usually to notorious criminals whose crimes have shocked the nation.</p>
      <p>Criminals serving whole life tariffs include Thomas Mair, who murdered the Labour MP Jo Cox, and serial killers such as the 'Yorkshire Ripper' Peter Sutcliffe and Rosemary West. There are currently more than 50 prisoners serving whole life sentences in the UK.</p>
      <p>A recent recipient of a whole tariff is <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/ice-man-mark-fellows-massey-16380560">Mark Felllows</a>, an underworld assassin known as the Iceman who murdered gangland figures <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/john-kinsella-paul-massey-murder-15464639">Paul Massey in Salford and John Kinsella</a> who was shot dead while walking his dog in Rainhill.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Marie previously told the ECHO: "After Helen's death, my life has changed drastically, I didn't go out, I avoided people and only went outside on a Sunday when I was searching for her.</p>
      <p>"I don't think Simms will ever tell me where she is.</p>
      <p>"It's like a power thing for killers like him, he's just a chip off the old block."</p>
