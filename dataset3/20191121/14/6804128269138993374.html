      <h1>Every word Manuel Pellegrini just said on Jose Mourinho, Spurs and West Ham's spiral in form</h1>
      <h2>The manager was asked about his opposite number this weekend and a lot more besides</h2>

      <p>
        <b>Antonio and Noble fit?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both of them worked the whole week without problem and will be involved in the game on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Of course they are important players for us, Antonio had a long injury and makes things happen in attacking, Mark Noble is the captain of the team. They are able to play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Thoughts on Fabianski's comments on Roberto?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every player when they are in a bad moments need the support of the fans behind them, especially in a special position like goalkeeper.</p>
      <p>Roberto has a lot of experience, in different countries. He knows maybe he is not playing his best performance but all of us, the fans, the staff and players, must trust in him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Tempted to make a change?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You always have different options in your squad. Finally, after a lot of thinking about different options, we will decide what will be the starting eleven.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How concerning is the spiral in form?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It was very unexpected.</p>
      <p>We started the last season very good, playing good and for different reasons, we must find out why we didn't continue playing the same way and to winning games.</p>

      <p>Especially against Palace and Sheffield at home are games we deserved better results but for different reasons we didn't win and those points we are now missing. Five points more and we'd be sixth position.</p>
      <p>The table is very tight, we must try to recover our performance as individuals and as a team and I hope this will be a good game to return to winning ways.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fired up for Spurs?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tottenham has a very good team with important players, that make the difference. You cannot know what has happened there but the results were not what they are used to having.</p>
      <p>Now they have a new manager, unfortunately for Mauricio Pochettino who did a very good job over a lot of years. I don't know their reason why he was sacked.</p>
      <p>Now they have another experienced manager in Jose that will bring important things to his team.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you see eye-to-eye with him?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I have answered the question a lot of times. Maybe I think a different way but he is not my enemy. Everyone has their options to play football the way they want and what they want to say.</p>
      <p>We have different ways of thinking about it all.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Go for a drink afterwards?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maybe. We have been a lot of times out of football together but I repeat, he is not my enemy.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Different tactics between Mourinho and Pochettino?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, not more difficult but different. Of course I think that the philosophy of Pochettino is not the same as the philosophy of Mourinho, but he's just in charge of the team in two days I don't think that in two days he will try to change all properly.</p>
      <p>So we will see Tottenham playing a similar way, of course with some touches of what Mourinho's football is but that is not the most difficult problem to solve during the game. The important problem is to have a good performance as a team.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How confident are you that you can get a good performance?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I trust a lot on the players because I know and they have demonstrated a lot of times they can do it against big teams. I think that this international break was good for us, maybe we had time to talk a lot things with the players to try and arrange some other ones.</p>
      <p>So I hope that all and especially in derby game, and we know that for our fans it's the most important game of the season playing against Tottenham at home, so I hope that tomorrow we see the West Ham that we saw at the beginning of the season.</p>

        <b>What have you talked about with the players, how do you explain what's going on?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A lot of different things, not always just one reason, I think there are several reasons why we couldn't continue playing the way we start this season I always said that first you need a good individual performance as a player and after that you have a good performance as a team.</p>
      <p>The only way to do it is to work in every ball together, when you don't have the ball try to recover with high pace, when you have the ball trying to play.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you noticed a dip in confidence?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Maybe we have a bit of confidence when the things were going right, now that that we don't have the results of course there is another positive energy to try to return to those good results.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How much pressure are you under?</b>
      </p>

      <p>I think that with 33 years in this profession I know what is football. I have answered the same questions another time, for me my pressure is bigger than any pressure.</p>
      <p>So the pressure that I feel in that moment is exactly the same as the pressure that I felt in that first day I was in charge of West Ham.</p>
      <p>For me it was a challenge to come here, it's a challenge I want to try to grow one step more with this club not just to be fighting for relegation or trying to be in the middle of the table, I think that we try to improve and play in the way I like to play football, that's my question.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Helped what's happened with Tottenham – Mourinho's arrival taking the pressure off?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pressure for me is to have a good team that plays good football in the way I like to do it, in the that we demonstrated the other week we can do it.</p>
      <p>I repeat also of course Tottenham is a special game but it's not the last game – it's not for me enough to try to beat Totteham and after that you try to be in the 12, 14 and 15 positions in the table because it's not my goal as a manager so that is my challenge and now we have to play against Tottenham.</p>
      <p>But I continue with trying to involve all the club and all the players and myself in a winning mentality and an ambitious mentality and trying to grow one step more with the club that has 60,00 fans behind you in every game.</p>
