      <h2>Micah Richards interacts with kids as part of the club community project Goals For Life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:52:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-CorrespondentMUMBAI-21191/" target="_blank">Special CorrespondentMUMBAI</a></address>
      <p>England defender Micah Richards is in the City to excite kids about playing football for a better chance to make a living.</p>
      <p>The former Manchester City captain and a member of the Premier League winning club squad in 2011-2012, is updated about the Indian Super League (ISL) through friends representing clubs here.</p>
      <p>He interacted with the kids at the Cooperage as part of the club community project Goals For Life, in association with the NGO named Oscar Foundation.</p>
      <p>Players like Matthew Mills (FC Pune City) and Matthew Kilgallon (Hyderabad FC) have kept the recently-retired Manchester City ace aware.</p>
      <p>“Friends playing here (Kilgallon and Mills) have spoken highly about the league. I have not seen the games in Engand, but both my friends who have been here said it is a good league and getting better,” said Richards, a member of the England squad at 2012 London Olympics.</p>
      <p>Manchester City FC promotes a campaign called Cityzens Giving, alongside a trophy tour involving the Premier League trophy.</p>
      <p>“The kids were asking me about how they could get a trial with Man City. It is difficult because Indian is known for cricket. If feels really good that people want to push football as well,” said the former England defender, who played in the London Games under Stuart Pearce as manager and Ryan Giggs as captain.</p>
      <p>Talking about the club’s initiative, he said: “This project is about giving kids an opportunity to do well in life. I am proud to be here, because the background I come from, things were not available to me as well, so value the opportunities these kids are getting to see the actual Premier League trophy.”</p>
      <p>The Oscar Foundation has centres in different places across the city for kids to go and enjoy a game of football, alongside studies which is compulsory for the trainees to be given access to sport.</p>
