      <p>The ongoing impeachment hearing in the US took an unexpected turn yesterday, when US President Donald Trump accidentally created a <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/buyer-s-guide-ramones">Ramones</a> lyric.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred after a day of drama in which the US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland appeared before the Senate Intel Committee. Following Sondland's testimony, Donald Trump held his usual ad-hoc press conference on the White House lawn, shouting to be heard above the whirring of helicopter blades. </p>
      <p>“I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NOTHING. I WANT NO QUID PRO QUO,” bellowed 45. “TELL ZELLINSKY TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THIS IS THE FINAL WORD FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."</p>
      <p>What caught the imagine of the Twittersphere wasn't so much the contents of Trump's booming oratory, but the fact that he appeared to be reading from a set of badly-scrawled notes. And that his delivery was pleasingly musical.</p>
      <p>So much so, in fact, that Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/SaoSasha/status/1197320791706263552">Alex Kliment</a> transformed the speech into a Ramones song. </p>

      <p>As is the way of the Internet, this was swiftly followed by <a href="https://twitter.com/NickLutsko/">Nick Lutsko</a>, who turned Trump's message into an instant Emo classic, and <a href="https://twitter.com/victoryrhoad/">Appa The Flying Bison</a>, who reimagined the speech as a song by once-popular warbling miserabilist Morrissey. </p>
      <p>Quite where this is headed next we can't imagine, but Johnny Ramone is probably grinning in his grave. </p>
