      <p>Actress <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-coronation-streets-brooke-vincent-the-actress-who-plays-sophie-webster/">Brooke Vincent</a> broke down in tears and felt "ashamed" after trying on "23 outfits" following her pregnancy, but none of them fitted.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> star was hoping her old jeans would "instantly fit" and she would be back to her "old self" but with her newborn baby Mexx by her side, but she was left disappointed that she couldn't get into numerous articles of her pre-pregnancy clothing.</p>

      <p>Sharing a picture of herself in watermelon pyjamas, she wrote on Instagram: "Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and makeup done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean, our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this.</p>
      <p>"I look like this because I naively thought that 4 weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.</p>
      <p>"I thought my jeans would instantly fit and I would just be my 'old self' only with my new beautiful baby.</p>
      <aside>I sat and cried and felt ashamed</aside>
      <p>"How wrong I was, I tried 23 outfits on at least, nothing looked right, nothing looked like me and I felt like I was looking at a completely different person, I suppose to a certain extent I now am, I am Mexx's mum.</p>
      <p>"I sat and cried and felt ashamed that I haven’t just been able to pick up where I left off like people seem to do here on Instagram!"</p>

      <p>Brooke has urged other new mums who feel the same not to beat themselves up, admitting the most important thing is that she and her four-week-old baby are "healthy and happy".</p>
      <p>She added: "The reason for this post is that even when you're in this bizarre industry you still get sucked in, you still feel a certain way when you see others posts.</p>
      <p>"So this was so important for me to say, for all the women who think they should look, act or feel a certain way after a baby DON'T! Don't beat yourself up.</p>
      <p>"Do you and if 4/6/8 weeks or even a year after giving birth you don’t fit in your old clothes don't worry, you can always join my club. It's important to be honest because being a new mummy is daunting enough!</p>
      <p>"The most important thing is me and Mexx are healthy and happy and as soon as my baby boy looked at me, I realised he doesn't care if I fit in my old jeans or not... So I guess creased watermelon PJs and slippers for now it is."</p>
