      <p><a href="https://groundbreaker.co/">Groundbreaker</a>, previously an investment crowdfunding platform and now a software solution for real estate investment firms, has raised $2 million in growth capital. The funding was led by Andrew Bluhm, of the family behind Rivers Casino, Walton Street Capital, and marquee Chicago properties.</p>
      <p>Groundbreaker, a bootstrapped company, reports that it currently supports $3 billion in assets under management and thousands of individual investors.</p>

      <p>Jake Marmulstein, CEO and founder of Groundbreaker, said the funding will enable his company to invest more in our product and on customer growth:</p>
      <blockquote>“Having been in the shoes of real estate investment professionals, and received years of customer feedback, we developed our application with the voice of every stakeholder​—from investor relations to controllers, capital markets professionals, and high net worth investors.”</blockquote>
      <p>Marmulstein explained that he discovered the inefficiencies of real estate investing firsthand at Watermark Capital Partners, a real estate investment trust.</p>
      <blockquote>“On another late night in the office fixing a waterfall model, I grew frustrated and started searching for a better way to do my work. I only found complex software that served large institutional firms, but nothing for the vast majority of companies who fund their deals through high net worth and accredited investors,” stated Marmulstein.</blockquote>
      <p>He claims that Groundbreaker is the first product to streamline investment management, fundraising, and investor relations for real estate investment firms that raise capital from individuals.</p>
      <p>Currently, Groundbreaker is working on a new version of its platform that is even more intuitive so that anyone can use the platform, regardless of their comfort around technology.</p>
      <blockquote>“We want to be the easiest to get started on, the easiest to explain, and the easiest to maintain and use,” said Marmulstein.</blockquote>
      <p>Groundbreaker aims to provide a set of tools that become indispensable to typical real estate deal sponsors.</p>

      <p>Bluhm explained that Groundbreaker’s software is specifically designed for small to midsize real estate syndicators to efficiently run their business.</p>
      <blockquote>“Think of it as the plumbing that directly connects investment companies to their investors, enabling easy communication, fundraising, and even distributions.​”</blockquote>
