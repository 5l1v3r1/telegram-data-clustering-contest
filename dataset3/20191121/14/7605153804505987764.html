        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 21 – National Assembly Public Investment Committee (PIC) has called for an audit on the use of Sh1.2 billion loan by the Spanish government to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) for the purchase of medical equipment.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The loan was secured in 2005 under then Finance Minister David Mwiraria.  </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>PIC ordered a fresh audit citing a contradicting report presented by the institution’s Chief Executive Officer Evanson Kamuri.</p>
      <p>Kamuri denied his involvement in the process of obtaining the funds while the report indicated direct correspondences between him and the Spanish Government. </p>
      <p>PIC Chairperson Nassir Abdullswamad Sheriff pointed out that the initial report showed that the loan had been procured by the Health Ministry despite Kamuri saying KNH did not have a direct hand in the process. </p>
      <p>“The issues that have been raised by most of the members is that the presentation you have done here is more in depth compared to what you had presented earlier,” the Mvita lawmaker stated.</p>
      <p>“In your own report you have provided CEO, there is nothing else except a cutesy call by the honorary council of Spain who came, you have indicated that there was no loan but if you look at the commercial agreement that is there indicates otherwise,” he added.</p>

      <p>Kamuri on the other hand was non-committal and stated that he would verify the claims before presenting a substantive report. </p>
      <p>He told the committee 15 per cent of the money was used on equipment maintenance with the remaining funds being plowed back to support medical services at the hospital.  </p>
      <p>“The money that remained from the project was used to operationalize the services,” said Kamuri. </p>
      <p>PIC members checked the available equipment’s in each medical sector and promised to call another meeting with Kamuri after the review of the audit is out. </p>
