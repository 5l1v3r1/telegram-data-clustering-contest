      <h3>Using rewards</h3>
      <p>With the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/wells-fargo-propel-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_110718_wf-propel-review&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Wells Fargo Propel</a>, you can transfer points for cash back or air travel through the Go Far Rewards program. It’s both low maintenance and convenient, which is perfect for anyone who doesn’t want the hassle of an intricate rewards interface.</p>
      <p>To put a valuation on the credit card’s rewards currency, each point is worth a penny. That’s standard across all areas of redemption, including travel, gift cards, charity donations, and cash back.</p>
      <p>There is no limit to the points you can earn, and points don’t expire as long as your account remains open. A great perk is that when it comes time to redeem your points, there are no blackout dates on air travel through Go Far Rewards.</p>
      <p>For those who love discerning award charts to see what redemption provides the best value, this card won’t feed your hunger. On the flip side, if you like credit cards with simple award charts and straightforward redemptions, the Propel card is for you. If you have more than one Wells Fargo credit card, you can pool your Go Far Rewards, earning you more points in a shorter amount of time.</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-benefits-you-dont-know-about-2018-11">With so many credit cards offering benefits like</a> purchase protection, travel protection, extended warranty coverage, return protection, coverage for lost or stolen items, travel accident insurance, lost baggage coverage, and domestic car rental insurance, it can be difficult to differentiate which card will be most beneficial to you; however, the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/wells-fargo-propel-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_110718_wf-propel-review&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Wells Fargo Propel</a> has a celebrated benefit that makes it easier to choose.</p>
      <p>Cell phone protection, which Wells Fargo offers with some of its other credit cards, provides up to $600 in protection against damage or theft (subject to $25 deductible). As long as you pay your monthly bill with the Propel, you will be able to take advantage of this benefit.</p>
      <p>Even if you don’t bank with Wells Fargo, you are still eligible for the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/wells-fargo-propel-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_110718_wf-propel-review&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Wells Fargo Propel</a>. While not a benefit per se, it’s nice to have the flexibility of using a card outside of your own bank.</p>
      <h3>The bottom line</h3>
      <p>When you consider the fact that most credit cards with any good benefits to speak of charge an annual fee upwards of $95, the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/card-details/wells-fargo-propel-american-express-card/?utm_campaign=bi_cl_110718_wf-propel-review&amp;amp;utm_source=referral">Wells Fargo Propel</a> is a bargain deal. You can still earn as many points as you would on another card, with the added incentive of getting cash back and earning 3x points in certain categories like dining, traveling, and popular streaming services.</p>
      <p>Plus, with 30,000 bonus points after spending $3,000 in the first three months, and no blackout dates on air travel through Go Far Rewards, you can take advantage of rewards quickly and unrestricted.</p>
      <p>The cell phone protection feature brings this card to the top of the list for <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-no-fee-credit-card">no-annual-fee rewards credit cards</a>.</p>
