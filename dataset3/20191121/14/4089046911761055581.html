      <p>The discovery came after weeks of searching in a southern section of property at King High School. They found evidence of coffins buried 3-5 feet deep, using radar to scan the ground.</p>
      <p>"We’ve pieced together a bunch of documents, and we kind of anticipated that it would come back this way," said Tamara Shamburger, a school board member. "But I really didn’t anticipate to get a report back this morning that said there were 145 coffins."</p>
      <p>Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County branch of the NAACP, became emotional as she spoke.</p>
      <p>"It just deeply saddens me that people can hate you that much," she said.</p>
      <p>Historical records show nearly 270 people were buried in Ridgewood, beginning in the 1940s. As many as 77 of them were infants and children.</p>
      <p>Rodney Kite-Powell with Tampa Bay History Center said burials started in 1942 with 34 people and continued through 1954 when the last nine people were interred there.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know how come the school didn’t know, because I stopped and talked to the construction people,” said resident Mary Talyor Francis.</p>
      <p>Francis, 91, said she knew the cemetery was there. She said there had been tombstones or other burial markers on the site.</p>
      <p>Planning is underway to memorialize the area. According to Kite-Powell, graves will likely be found at other locations.</p>
      <p>"Without a doubt, there will be at least one or two more that will come to light," he said.</p>
