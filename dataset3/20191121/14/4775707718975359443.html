      <h3>The 14 Quickest Game Completions From the Latest Black Friday Xbox Sales</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sean+Carey">Sean Carey</a>, 21 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/><b>UPDATE:</b> We've just picked up the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39785/xbox-360-black-friday-sale">Xbox 360 Black Friday Sale</a>, unfortunately, there weren't too many easy completions from that sale other than the super easy <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Avatar-The-Burning-Earth/achievements">Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Burning Earth</a>, and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Valiant-Hearts-The-Great-War-Xbox-360/achievements">Valiant Hearts: The Great War</a> — although the latter is going to take you about 6-8 hours to complete and is only worth 400G.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39784/heres-every-game-and-dlc-discounted-in-the-xbox-black-friday-sale-2019">Xbox Black Friday sale</a> has landed, and there are a tonne of games on offer — the list is almost overwhelming, especially if you're seeking out titles that are quick and easy completions. Fear not, savvy achievement hunter, we've done the leg work for you and pulled the 14 quickest and easiest game completions as determined by their TA Ratios and estimated completion times from the Black Friday Sale. As always, we've linked to the Microsoft Store where you can pick up these discounted games, and to each title's individual hub, where you'll find individual achievement guides and handy full-game achievement walkthroughs if one's been written.</p>

      <p>Let's get these out of the way first: <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Life-Is-Strange/achievements">Life is Strange</a>, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Life-Is-Strange-Before-The-Storm/achievements">Life Is Strange: Before the Storm</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Life-is-Strange-2/achievements">Life is Strange 2</a> all feature on our list. Now, all of these game's are a bit of a time sink if you're looking to complete them 100%, although they still are easy completions. If you're unaware of how the Life is Strange series works, each game is episodic with Life is Strange and Life is Strange 2 comprising of five episodes each, and Before the Storm having three episodes. Each episode is roughly 2-3 hours long. All the achievements in Life is Strange and Before the Storm as well as most in Life is Strange 2 involve a series of collectables per episode. It's probably worth checking out our <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Life-Is-Strange/walkthrough">walkthroughs</a> for each game to make sure you don't miss a collectable. Both Life is Strange and Before the Storm are discounted to under $5, and are well worth it for the story alone. However, they are also all included in <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a>. Life is Strange 2 is coming in at $20, but we are still waiting for the final episode for Life is Strange 2 to release on December 3.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Brothers-A-Tale-of-Two-Sons/achievements">Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons</a> is another easy completion that should take you around 2-3 hours to nail its 12 achievements for 1000G. We have a fantastic <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Brothers-A-Tale-of-Two-Sons/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> up on site that should guide you through the process if you get stuck, as well as plenty of achievement guides. The game has been well received by the TA community garnering a 3.85/5 – for those who don't know, it's from the same developer behind A Way Out. It's on sale for $3.99; however, it is also in <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> and in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xcloud/games">Project xCloud preview list of games</a> – so if you don't fancy making the purchase you can always complete it through one of those.</p>

      <p>Next up, we have <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Black-The-Fall/achievements">Black the Fall</a>. The puzzle-platformer has 14 achievements worth 1000G. The estimated completion time for Black the Fall is around 1-2 hours. Out of those 14 achievements, there are nine which involve collectables. Thankfully, we have another well-written <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Black-The-Fall/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> with 166 likes from TA members. Our official <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n29128/black-the-fall-review">site review</a> gives Black the Fall a 3.5/5 and with the game on sale for $6, it might be worth picking up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Tacoma/achievements">Tacoma</a> is on sale for $3.99 and has 12 achievements worth 1000G. This is an adventure game from the same team behind Gone Home, and it's a quick completion that clocks in around 1-2 hours. Seven of the game's achievements are collectables, so it's a good idea to flick through the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Tacoma/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> if you get a bit stumped. The game is also in <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass-pc/games">Game Pass for PC</a>, so just bear that in mind before you make a purchase.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Old-Mans-Journey/achievements">Old Man's Journey</a> is another easy completion with 12 achievements for its 1000 Gamerscore. Its completion time is estimated to be around 1-2 hours, and there's another highly rated <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Old-Mans-Journey/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> attached to this one. Old Man's Journey will set you back $4.99, although it is included in <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass-pc/games">Game Pass for PC</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Virginia/achievements">Virginia</a> is a steal for just $1.99 in the Black Friday sale. It has 17 achievements for 1000G, with a slightly longer completion time of around 3-4 hours. This is largely down to the Doam achievement requiring a second playthrough of the game, so just bear that in mind. Mark gave a 4/5 score for the game in his <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n25197/virginia-review">Virginia Xbox One review</a> and for just $2, it seems like an easy sell for a dedicated achievement hoarder. There's another good <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Virginia/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> for this one too, make sure to check it out.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Elea/achievements">Elea</a> looks to be an easy completion, though it's a little more of a wild card. Only around 40% of owners on site have completed it, but the achievement list doesn't look too taxing. There is one achievement that requires you to complete a certain part of the game in under 15 seconds and another for sitting on every chair and bed available. However, we have some decent achievement guides and a great walkthrough that should help if you get stumped. Looking at the walkthrough, it's estimated to take around 2-4 hours. Costing under $3, Elea is another easy sell for anyone looking to flip some easy Gamerscore.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/ABZU/achievements">ABZÛ</a> is a game that regularly features on easy completion lists. It has 12 achievements worth 1000G and should take you around 1-2 hours to complete. Another great <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/ABZU/walkthrough">walkthrough</a> attached with 815 upvotes from the community. While this game is in both <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass/games">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/xbox-game-pass-pc/games">Game Pass for PC</a>; however, it is leaving at the end of the month. If you haven't completed it and don't think you'll get around to it before November is up, you can pick it up in the sale for $9.99. It's also well regarded by critics and players alike, compared favourably with the likes of Journey for its art style and atmosphere.</p>
      <p>As always, let us know in the comments if you think we've missed any easy completions from this week's Black Friday sale and if you'll be picking up any of the games from our list.</p>
