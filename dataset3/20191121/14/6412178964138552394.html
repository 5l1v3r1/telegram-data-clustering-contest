        <b>New Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho had a special message for his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino after being unveiled by his new club on Thursday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having been appointed just hours after the popular Argentine was shown the door, Mourinho was full of praise for the work that Pochettino did in his five-year stay in north London.</p>
      <p>He told reports: “I do it with a bit of sadness but I have to speak about Mauricio. I have to congratulate him for the work he has done. This club will always be his home. This training ground will always be his training ground. The door will always be open for him.</p>
      <p>“He can come when he wants, when he misses the people he works with, the door is always open for him. From my experience, tomorrow is another day and he will find happiness again.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho is, however, convinced he made the right choice to return to management with Spurs, adding: “Happiness-wise I am convinced my choice was a great one.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes results make these decisions. I wouldn’t say it’s a [big] job [to turn things around]. The club is huge. I know that I have potentially a great job in my hands.</p>
      <p>“I had a feeling I was going to get a club mid-season. I knew I would be in a situation where I would get only one or two days before my first game.</p>
      <p>“I cannot come here and think it is about myself. It is about the players and going from a base of stability.</p>
      <p>“During my career, I made mistakes. I’m not going to make the same mistakes. I’ll make new mistakes. I’m not going to say I’m more fit. I was always fit.”</p>
