      <p>Mr Nolan recalled finding the injured 30 year-old in the street beside the Old Stag Inn bar in Glasgow's Pollokshaws.</p>
      <p>The 65 year-old stated he then spotted a man with a “seriously big knife” apparently “strolling” away from the scene.</p>
      <p>He was giving evidence at the trial of David Callaghan, 30, and Craig Corrall, 39, at the High Court in Glasgow, where they deny murdering Mr Hassan.</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan – an electrician - told the court he had been at the pub on the night of the alleged killing for a meeting with other tradesman.</p>
      <p>The bar is run by Mr Hassan's mum Ann Marie Lynch.</p>
      <p>The trial previously heard how Mr Hassan came in that evening to collect keys and left before Miss Lynch later became aware of an incident outside.</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan recalled getting a “fright” after hearing a “clatter”.</p>

      <p>He said he went out and found Mr Hassan on the ground trying to get up.</p>
      <p>The witness added: “I just thought it was a punching or a kicking. I never expected this.”</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan told the court he then noticed “a guy walking down the road”.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Lynsey MacDonald asked: “How fast was he going?”</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan said: “He was not – just a stroll. I said: 'What the f*** are you doing?'.</p>
      <p>“The guy turned around and just stared at me. He had a weapon. There was no speech, nothing. It was a butcher's knife. It was big, seriously big.”</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan said to the court Mr Hassan's mum grabbed him to try and get him back inside.</p>
      <p>But asked if he did return to the pub, he added: “No. I seen the state the boy was in.</p>
      <p>“I don't think his mum actually saw what I did. I went for CPR, but his face was hanging off. His mother was on the phone to the paramedics.</p>
      <p>“The boy was lying there and I put him in the recovery position. You could tell that it was pretty heavy.</p>
      <p>“He was trying to talk, trying to get up. His eyes were going by the second, clouding over, but there was still life in him yet. I stayed with him until the paramedics arrived.”</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan – who eventually did give CPR - said he tried to stop Miss Lynch seeing the extent of her son's injuries.</p>
      <p>The witness went on: “His face was off, like a hinge.”</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan said he had got to know Miss Lynch since she took over the Old Stag Inn often helping with maintenance jobs.</p>
      <p>Corral's QC Thomas Ross later asked: “You shared a terrible experience where her son was killed outside the pub and were trying to help Owen before ambulance got there?”</p>
      <p>Mr Nolan said: “Yes.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim Mr Hassan was chased, seized by the body and then repeatedly struck with knives or machetes.</p>
      <p>The trial before Lord Woolman continues.</p>
