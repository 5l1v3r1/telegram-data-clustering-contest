      <p>THREE MEN HAVE been arrested in recent days in relation to threats to kill and cause serious harm to people made on social media.</p>
      <p>It’s believed the arrests may be connected to <a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/fermanagh-serious-assault-4894919-Nov2019/">last weekend’s machete attack</a> carried out at a house in Co Fermanagh. </p>
      <p>This morning, gardaí conducted a number of planned searches in the Athlone area, searching for weapons which were displayed in these videos and media devices used in the commission of these crimes. </p>
      <p>A number of electronic devices and weapons were seized during the searches, gardaí said in a statement. </p>
      <p>The searches involved Garda resources from Athlone and the Regional Support Unit. </p>
      <p>During the course of these searches, three men were arrested (one aged in his late 40s and the other two aged in their 20s). </p>
      <p>They are currently being detained at Mullingar and Athlone Garda Stations under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984. </p>
      <p>Gardaí in Athlone are liaising with the PSNI in relation to those arrested and the social media videos.</p>
      <p>It is believed the arrests may be connected to last weekend’s machete attack in which a gang forced entry into the property at Trasna way, Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh on Saturday evening and attacked a woman and 13-year-old girl inside. </p>
      <p>The teenage girl sustained serious stab wounds and was taken to hospital where her condition was described as critical. </p>
      <p>A 41-year-old woman was also treated for stab wounds to her leg.</p>
      <p>A baby was present at the scene but was unharmed in the incident.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thejournal.ie/girl-stabbed-baby-fermanagh-4895689-Nov2019/">On Monday</a>, a relative said the teenager was protecting her 11-month-old nephew when the attack happened. </p>
