        <b>CONOR McGREGOR released an incredible body transformation picture ahead of his UFC comeback - teasing what weight he will return at.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Irish superstar announced in Moscow this month that he will be in action again on January 18 - after a year on the sidelines.</p>

      <p>McGregor last fought in October 2018, losing to lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229.</p>
      <p>But after an injury to the 31-year-old’s famous left hand ruled him out of a summer comeback.</p>
      <p>However, The Notorious is set to make his octagon return in Las Vegas with UFC veteran Donald ‘Cowboy’ Cerrone in line to be the opponent.</p>
      <p>Without the bout confirmed, McGregor has teased the division he will fight at- with Cerrone a lightweight and welterweight contender.</p>
      <h3>FEATHERWEIGHT</h3>
      <p>The Notorious exploded onto the UFC scene in 2013 at 145lbs winning six straight before challenging cage legend Jose Aldo for the title at UFC 194 at the end of 2015.</p>
      <p>After just 13 seconds and one left hand thrown, McGregor dethroned Aldo to become the new featherweight king.</p>
      <p>However, immediately after the Irish star was given a lightweight title shot against Rafeal dos Anjos, but after the Brazilian pulled out, he went on to face Nate Diaz twice at welterweight.</p>
      <p>McGregor held his featherweight title up until he challenged Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight crown, becoming the first to simultaneously hold two belts simultaneously.</p>
      <p>But the UFC stripped him of his featherweight gold in 2017, meaning he reigned for 18-months as champion without defending the belt, and has not fought at the weight since.</p>

      <h3>LIGHTWEIGHT</h3>
      <p>McGregor entered the UFC as the Cage Warriors champion, but did not fight at 155lbs for another six years.</p>
      <p>After consecutive welterweight bouts against Diaz, the Irishman was given a lightweight title clash against Alvarez at UFC 205 - winning by second round KO.</p>
      <p>But after switching to boxing for a money-spinning cameo in the ring, losing to Floyd Mayweather in 2017, The Notorious again lost his belt outside the cage.</p>
      <p>Without making a defence of his 155lbs crown, Nurmagomedov became the new lightweight king winning the vacant strap against Al Iaquinta at UFC 223.</p>
      <p>In McGregor’s last bout, he challenged rival Nurmagomedov for the belt, but was submitted in four rounds.</p>

      <h3>WELTERWEIGHT</h3>
      <p>After Dos Anjos pulled out of his showdown against McGregor, the UFC had 10 days to find a replacement.</p>
      <p>Diaz, a lightweight, was selected but on short notice the bout was made at 170lbs - meaning The Notorious was leaping 25lbs at the time, coming off his featherweight title win against Aldo.</p>
      <p>McGregor lost the first fight at UFC 196 but avenged the result in the rematch five months later on points.</p>
      <p>The Irishman has not fought at welterweight since, but was last year close to fighting Dos Anjos for the interim 170lbs title.</p>
      <p>McGregor recently stated he wanted to face the winner between Jorge Masvidal and Diaz - who main-evented UFC 244 at welterweight - suggesting the southpaw is open to fighting again at 170lbs.</p>
