      <p>There’s another letter to find in Fortnite and this time, you’re looking for the second letter T.</p>
      <p>By now, you’ll have gathered enough letters over the last few weeks to spell out F-O-R-T-N-I, so here’s where you can find the second letter T.</p>
      <p>As usual, this area will get quite busy so you might want to use <b>Party Assist </b>and team up with a buddy, otherwise, grab a weapon and build a few walls around you once you’ve found it.</p>
      <h3>Where to find the second letter T</h3>
      <p>To get started, head to <b>Weeping Woods</b>. You’re looking for a wooden bridge to the north of the area over the river. On a platform below, you’ll find the letter T spinning around. Grab it to complete the challenge.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/20/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-to-be-extended-until-february-2020/">Season 1 has been extended to February 2020,</a> so you’ve got plenty of time to find these letters.</p>
