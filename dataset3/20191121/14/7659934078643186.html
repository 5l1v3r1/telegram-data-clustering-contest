      <p>Cyprus authorities have rescued 120 Syrian migrants from a boat adrift off the island's southeastern coast, police said on Thursday.<br/><br/>They brought the Syrians ashore in the Cape Greco region after their vessel was sighted six nautical miles (11 km) off the east Mediterranean island.<br/><br/>The boat was spotted on Wednesday and the migrants -- including 20 children, 14 of them unaccompanied minors, and three women -- were taken to a reception center outside the capital Nicosia.<br/><br/>The migrants told police they had crossed the Syria-Turkey border and the boat sailed from Mersin in Turkey, a route previously used by people smugglers.<br/><br/>Those on board said they had paid $4,000 each for the journey to the smugglers, who managed to get away.<br/><br/>In August, Cyprus requested that fellow European Union member states take in 5,000 of its migrants to alleviate the "disproportionate pressures" it faced.<br/><br/>The small EU member says it is on the front line of the Mediterranean migration route.<br/><br/>Available data shows the number of migrants arriving in Cyprus and applying for asylum between January and June 2019 reached nearly 7,000.<br/><br/>The backlog of applications has increased to 15,000.<br/><br/>Cyprus, which is 160 km from the Syrian coast, has not seen the massive inflow of migrants experienced by Turkey and Greece.</p>
