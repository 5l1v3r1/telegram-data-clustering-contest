The Soldier who allegedly committed the crime was identified as Private Magandu.</p>
      <aside>“A young presidential guard soldier emptied his magazine firing in the air at State House in Harare this morning. He was arrested as he was reloading. He complained of hardships and said he “can’t survive in dead economy’. He’s been detained by the military at its holding cells”<br/>“On arrest PVT Magandu was interviewed by Lt Col S Murombo, detained at KGVI; tortured &amp; deprived of sleep for alleged links with opposition &amp; foreigners; ranted that “men in suits get all the money but real army gets nothing”.
