      <h1>GTFO’s Rundown system is how the game will keep things interesting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:08:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>GTFO’s latest trailer digs deep into the Rundown.</p>
      <p><b>GTFO</b>, the co-op survival horror shooter from 10 Chambers, takes place within an underground complex. Players are sent into different sections of the massive bunker to scavenge and perform specific tasks.</p>
      <p>These orders are issued regularly by a mysterious entity called The Warden, as part of a system the developer calls Rundown. The Rundown is essentially all the missions available at any given time. The deeper inside the complex they’re set, the harder they are.</p>
      <p>Depending on the number of missions and how deep they go, each Rundown could last days or weeks, before it’s replaced with a different one made up of entirely new missions in different environments and populated by different enemies.</p>
      <p>The developer says each mission will be crafted to offer a specific experience, and new Rundowns will help keep the game fresh every time you log in.</p>
