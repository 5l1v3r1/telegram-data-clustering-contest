      <h1>Assassin's Creed Dev Becomes Block Producer for EOS-Based Gaming Startup</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:08:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author">Adrian Zmudzinski</a></address>
      <p>Ubisoft, the game development giant behind the videogame Assassin’s Creed, partnered with EOS-based game distribution platform Ultra.</p>
      <p>According to a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Nov. 21, Ubisoft will be a corporate block producer on the testnet version of Ultra’s EOS sidechain, dubbed UOS. As such, the company will help maintain the network and approve transactions on it during the trial period.</p>
      <h3>Alignment of interests</h3>
      <p>Transactions on the network will include in-game asset creation, ownership transfers between players and payments. Per the release, Ultra chose Ubisoft as a block producer because it is in the game developer’s best interest to help the platform grow, and the gaming giant also has the technical ability to provide meaningful help.</p>
      <p>Founder and co-CEO of Ultra Nicolas Gilot said that Ubisoft’s “years long dedication to exploring blockchain technology ensures they have the knowledge and skills to be excellent block producers.”</p>
      <p>Ubisoft’s Blockchain Initiative director Nicolas Pouard explained that the firm believes it is important to support gaming-related blockchain applications, adding:</p>
      <blockquote>“During this first trial period of collaboration, we hope to help them in bringing it to a larger scale and experiment with the possibilities this opens up for the industry.”</blockquote>
      <p>Company data website <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ubisoft#section-competitors-revenue-by-owler">Crunchbase</a> estimates Ubisoft’s revenue to be $2.5 billion. Its Assassin’s creed series videogame <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/how-popular-is-assassins-creed-the-series-has-sold-over-140-million-copies/">reportedly</a> sold over 140 million copies.</p>
      <p>Ultra has already announced other block producers earlier this year. As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitfinex-among-first-block-producers-of-blockchain-games-distributor-ultraio">reported</a> in early October, the Ultra network’s first three block producers were cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, and regional EOS development communities EOS Rio and EOS New York.</p>
