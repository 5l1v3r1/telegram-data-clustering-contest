      <p>Hundreds of thousands of unlicensed vehicles are being driven on UK roads, official figures show.</p>
      <p>Data published by the Department for Transport (DfT) shows an estimated 634,000 vehicles are being used, despite their vehicle excise duty (VED) not being paid.</p>
      <p>This represents 1.6% of all vehicles in UK traffic, down from 1.8% in 2017.</p>
      <p>Some 46% of vehicles being used with no VED have been untaxed for more than two months, suggesting there is a persistent minority of motorists who are intentionally not taxing their vehicles.</p>

      <p>Lost revenue from non-payment of VED has soared since the abolition of the paper tax disc in October 2014.</p>
      <p>Figures for Britain show the potential total has risen from £35 million in 2013/14 to £85 million in 2019/20.</p>
      <p>Abolishing the paper disc removed the visual in-vehicle reminder of the expiry date for VED, although notifications are sent by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).</p>
      <p>The Government said at the time that the decision would eventually save the DVLA about £7 million a year.</p>
      <p>Every vehicle registered in the UK must be taxed if it is driven or parked on a public road.</p>
      <p>Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said: “Despite the recent slight fall in evasion, the rate is still far higher in this age of digital renewal than back when motorists received a paper disc to display to prove they’d paid.</p>
      <p>“VED evasion doesn’t just short-change government, in the future it will also lead to worse highways.</p>
      <p>“Ministers have previously committed to ring-fencing VED revenue for spending on our major roads, and judging by the state of the network, we need the Treasury to collect every single penny that’s due.</p>
      <p>“There’s also a safety issue, because when we pay we are prompted to check that we have motor insurance, and that vehicles over three years old have a valid MOT.”</p>
      <p>The DfT noted that some of the potential lost revenue is recovered through DVLA enforcement action, or by payments being made at a later date.</p>
