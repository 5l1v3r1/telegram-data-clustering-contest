      <h1>The parking charge changes for Solihull village's Christmas lights switch-on</h1>
      <h2>The council has introduced temporary measures for the Knowle event</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:23:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author">David Irwin, https://www.facebook.com/David-Irwin-Local-Democracy-Reporter-792811574238027/?ref=settings</a></address>
      <p>Parking restrictions will be relaxed in Knowle to support the village's Christmas lights switch-on next week.</p>
      <p>The council has agreed to special arrangements on Wednesday, November 27, when the festive decorations will be officially unveiled and many traders will be offering late night shopping.</p>
      <p>Visit <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/knowle">Knowle</a>, a group of businesses and residents which got together earlier this year, believes the community-led event will be a big boost in the crucial pre-<a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> period.</p>
      <p>But there has been a push locally to make parking easier for shoppers and avoid issues with cars being left in nearby residential streets.</p>
      <p>This week the council agreed to suspend charges in its free and display car parks between 4-6pm and keep the Knowle Park facilities open later, to provide extra spaces.</p>

      <p>Kim Hulse, from Visit Knowle, said the aim was to get shoppers to stop out a bit longer and support independent businesses.</p>
      <p>"The feedback from some of the shoppers [last year] was it was quite difficult to park, so we have been working to take that barrier away and make it easier," said the self-employed businesswoman.</p>
      <p>Karen Blondel, from the Indigo Art Gallery, said there would be a "great atmosphere" at the event and the later opening was a boon in terms of attracting customers into outlets along the High Street.</p>
      <p>Visit Knowle was launched around six months ago and was inspired by the proactive approach of residents who had previously set up the Knowle, Dorridge and Bentley Heath Neighbourhood Forum.</p>

      <p>"Some local people are really [passionate] about Knowle and love the village but were concerned about all the empty units, concerned about parking and thought it was a good time to take action," said Ms Hulse.</p>
      <p>The group is looking at a number of ways to promote the village and has urged others who would like to get involved to get in touch.</p>
      <p>The temporary parking measures were rubber-stamped at a council decision session this week.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Paul Tovey, from the highways team, said the proposals were "reasonable, practical and affordable", with the council expected to lose less than £500 from stopping the charges at 4pm (they would usually continue until 6pm).</p>
      <p>The same arrangements would be expected to apply in future years, although this would be subject to there being no significant financial burden on the local authority.</p>
      <p>Cllr Ken Hawkins, cabinet member for the environment and highways, said: "It's a nice bit of good news for Knowle."</p>
      <p>The lights ceremony will start at 4.15pm, with singers providing entertainment and - as an added attraction this year -  pop-up shops will be set up in the Greswolde Arms.<a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/knowle">Knowle</a></p>
