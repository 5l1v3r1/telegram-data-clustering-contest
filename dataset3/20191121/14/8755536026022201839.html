      <p>An incredible mural of Dolores O’Riordan has appeared in her hometown of Limerick.</p>
      <p>The Cranberries singer died suddenly in January 2018, after she accidentally drowned in a hotel bath due to alcohol intoxication.</p>
      <p>Almost two years after her tragic death, popular artist ACHES created a stunning mural of Dolores near King John’s Castle in the Medieval Quarter of Limerick.</p>
      <p>The mural was erected through Draw Out, who bring the best street artists from around the world to Limerick to re-imagine and transform the city’s derelict sites.</p>

      <p>ACHES is an Irish graffiti writer and muralist hailing from Dublin who has been creating art since the age of 15.</p>
      <p>He’s arguably best known for his mural of Savita Halappanavar, which appeared the night before the Repeal referendum.</p>
      <p>The news comes after <a href="http://goss.ie/showbiz/the-cranberries-have-been-nominated-for-a-grammy-award-191267">The Cranberries were nominated for their first ever Grammy Award on Wednesday</a>, in the Best Rock Album category.</p>
      <p>The band released their final album, In the End, earlier this year as a tribute to Dolores.</p>
