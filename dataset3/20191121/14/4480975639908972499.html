      <h1>Aurora Cannabis Stock Price: Debentures, upbeat survey keep it bid, outlook cautiously optimistic</h1>

          <b>Aurora's stock price has been recovering from the lows as investors convert debentures. </b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Optimism about investment in the sector has been pushing all stocks higher.</b>
        </li>
        <li><b>Legalization may be the next substantial driver for pot stocks</b>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Aurora Cannabis Incorporated </b>(ACB), the Edmonton-based company, has leaped by over 12% on Wednesday and closed at a price of $3.50. Its recent rises defy speculation that placed a $1 target for the Toronto-traded share. The most recent surge came after Aurora announced that<b> 94% of debentures allowed to settle this week</b>.</p>
      <p>While some have criticized the highly-dilutive conditions, the <b>quick uptake</b>, coming well before the March 2020 deadline, has encouraged investors. Later this week, the firm will publish a press release by detailing the status of the financial maneuver. </p>
      <h3>Investing in Marijuana Stocks</h3>
      <p>The marijuana company has also benefited from <b>optimism about the broader sector</b>. According to a survey by KCSA Strategic Communications, no fewer than <b>86% of respondents said they are bullish </b>on the pot industry despite substantial falls in equity prices. Even in the face of a potential recession, only 5% said it would cause them to sell off their holdings. However, investments have become smaller, with fewer heavy-weight exposures of over $100,000.</p>
      <p>For Aurora and the broader sector to rise, <b>legalizing weed on the federal level in the US is needed</b>. The House of Representatives is advancing legislation that includes expungement, but the road is long until the world's largest economy adopts the Canadian model.</p>

      <p>Despite the significant rise on Wednesday, <b>ACB is still down on the week</b>. In order to close the week on a high note, the share price needs to gain another dollar. It closed the previous week around $4.50. </p>
      <p>Support awaits at the weekly low of $2.90, but the round level of $3.00 may come into play. Likewise, any further advance may find <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> at $4. These round numbers draw attention and are of psychological importance.</p>
