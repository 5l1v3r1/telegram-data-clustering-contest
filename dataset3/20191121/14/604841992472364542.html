      <p>Helen McEntee has been elected as Vice-President of the European People’s Party (EPP) at the Party’s Congress in Zagreb. </p>
      <p>Minister McEntee’s election means she will form part of the EPP leadership team that will include newly elected EPP President Donald Tusk and President of the European Commission Ursula Von Der Leyen.</p>
      <p>“The EU faces many challenges including, climate change, negotiating the Future Relationship with the UK, ensuring equality amongst men and women, migration and many others," she said..</p>
      <p>“I want to play a proactive role on all of these issues, not only in my role as Minister for European Affairs for Ireland, but now as Vice-President of the EPP.</p>
      <p>“The EPP is the European People’s party. It is a party for all people and it should remain so. I firmly believe that our citizens should be connected to the decision-making processes of the EU. This is something that I am very passionate about, having led Ireland’s national Citizens’ Dialogue on the Future of Europe last year. This is something that the EPP must continue to take an active and enhanced role in.</p>
      <p>“In particular, I believe our young people should be represented at every level including within the Vice Presidency of the EPP. As the youngest candidate, I am delighted to be in a position to do this.</p>
      <p>“The world is changing and we, as a party, need to be able to adapt and change with it. I look forward to working with the new team led by Donal Tusk."</p>
      <p>An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “Congratulations to Helen McEntee on her election as EPP Vice President. She is an outstanding European Affairs Minister, representing Ireland through the Brexit negotiations and forging alliances across Europe. She is passionate about equality of opportunity, mental health, the environment, and ensuring that Europe works for future generations. This is a great result for Fine Gael, for the EPP and for Ireland.”</p>
      <p>Minister McEntee concluded by saying, “Finally, I would like to acknowledge my predecessor Dara Murphy whose work, commitment and passion for the EPP helped the party return in the recent European elections as the largest group in the EU Parliament.  I hope to continue his excellent work in the years ahead and work closely with him over that period,” she concluded.</p>
