      <h1>Prioritize safety and civility in Seattle budget</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:23:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/cap-seattle-times-editorial-board/" target="_blank">The Seattle Times editorial board</a></address>
      <p>As the Seattle City Council finalizes its 2020 budget, members should continue funding the city’s innovative approaches to persistent crime problems.</p>
      <p>That includes the Navigation Team, which pairs police and social workers to provide outreach — connecting people to services and housing — as well as removal of unsanctioned encampments.</p>
      <p>The 38-person team is a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/cutting-seattles-navigation-team-budget-would-be-a-disaster-for-homeless/">cornerstone</a> of the city’s massive homelessness response that’s showing progress — <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/seattle-says-its-navigation-team-is-getting-more-people-into-shelter/">slowly but significantly</a>. This year’s point-in-time count saw a 17% reduction in the number of unsheltered people living in dangerous, inhumane conditions.</p>
      <p>Council members on Tuesday wisely rejected a proposal by Kshama Sawant to defund the program. A <a href="https://council.seattle.gov/2019/11/19/budget-committee-votes-to-amend-citys-6-5b-budget/">final budget vote</a> is expected Monday.</p>
      <p>To help address safety and civility problems caused by prolific offenders cycling through the city’s court system with little consequence, the council should also fund creative new responses <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/city-budget/2020-proposed-budget">proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan</a>.</p>
      <p>They include an expanded shelter with supportive services in a vacant section of the King County jail downtown; an additional city attorney to improve case management and coordinate with diversion programs; and a pilot program providing specialized probation services, with counselors using trauma-informed strategies to better serve offenders with high needs.</p>

      <p>These suggestions were generated by a <a href="https://durkan.seattle.gov/2019/09/members-of-regions-high-barrier-individuals-working-group-announce-new-pilot-programs-to-focus-on-individuals-cycling-through-the-criminal-justice-system-in-seattle-and-king-county/">task force</a>, including social-service providers and public-health experts. Whether they go far enough to address crime problems remains to be seen, but the council should support this fledgling effort.</p>
      <p>So far the council has funded the expanded jail shelter and services but not $170,000 for the probation pilot program.</p>
      <p>Councilmember Sally Bagshaw, who is leading the budget deliberations, supports the pilot program and said “it’s not going away.”</p>
      <p>The program is called enhanced probation, “but they’re talking about enhanced services — meeting people where they are, getting them the services they need and making sure there’s a warm handoff” after they leave the courtroom, she said.</p>
      <p>If the council majority insists on making a political statement against probation by declining the $170,000 appropriation, Durkan should find a way to fund it with other revenue in the $1.5 billion general fund, or with a supplemental budget addition next year.</p>
      <p>Budgets are a statement of priorities. Providing supportive programs for a few hundred criminal offenders with behavioral health problems is one priority.</p>
      <p>There are many more victims of crimes these offenders commit. Victims are often low-wage workers, including retail clerks threatened and assaulted at random. Providing these workers and other residents safety and justice must also be a top priority of the city’s elected representatives.</p>
