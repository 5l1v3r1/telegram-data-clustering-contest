      <p>Musicians <a href="https://www.insider.com/shawn-mendes-and-camila-cabello-dating-relationship-timeline-2019-6">Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello</a> first met in 2014 and over the years they became close friends and collaborated on two hit songs, “I Know What You Did Last Summer” and “Senorita.”</p>
      <p>But the pair didn’t <i>officially</i> become a couple until 2019.</p>
      <p>“During ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer,’ I really bonded with him as more than a friend,” Cabello told Rolling Stone, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/camila-cabello-interview-romance-shawn-mendes-912838/">recalling her 2015 collaboration with Mendes</a>. “I think he did too, but we were both really young, and he was experiencing the pressures of his career.”</p>
      <p>She said they didn’t know “what to do with those feelings” and spent a while liking each other but not being together. But Cabello said as they began spending more time with one another, the two just connected and realized they wanted to be more than friends.</p>

      <p>Award-winning actors Courtney B. Vance and Angela Bassett have been married for over 20 years.</p>
      <p>But before they embarked on their love story, Vance and Bassett spent years as friends.</p>
      <p>The actors met when the two were students at Yale Drama School in the 1980s. Things never got romantic at the time because Vance had a girlfriend who <a href="https://people.com/movies/angela-bassett-courtney-b-vance-passionate-marriage/">Bassett described as “beautiful” in an interview with People magazine</a> in 2018.</p>
      <p>The couple reconnected years later in Hollywood, <a href="https://people.com/movies/angela-bassett-courtney-b-vance-passionate-marriage/">eventually married in 1997</a>, and had children. In 2007, Vance and Bassett co-wrote the book, “<a href="https://www.essence.com/celebrity/black-celeb-couples/angela-bassett-courtney-vance-wedding-marriage-things-know/">Friends: A Love Story</a>,” which follows their relationship through the years.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Before they became a pop music power couple, <a href="https://variety.com/gallery/the-mickey-mouse-club-famous-members/">Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake worked together</a> on “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/flashback-britney-justin-and-christina-on-the-mickey-mouse-club-232800/">The Mickey Mouse Club</a>” from 1993 to 1995.</p>
      <p>The two developed a friendship as they grew up on screen in front of their fans.</p>
      <p>After the show ended, the friendship developed into a romance and the <a href="https://people.com/music/britney-spears-mickey-mouse-club-reunion-would-attend/">pair started dating in 1999</a> before splitting in 2002.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Marcus Mumford and Carey Mulligan are now married, but the two have known each other for over a decade.</p>
      <p>The Mumford and Sons front-man and “The Great Gatsby” actress’ friendship began after the two <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/88988-how-did-carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-meet-their-love-story-has-a-lot-to-do">attended the same Christian summer camp</a> and kept in touch by writing letters.</p>
      <p>They lost touch after a while but <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/88988-how-did-carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-meet-their-love-story-has-a-lot-to-do">reconnected as adults at a party in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2011</a>. At that point, it didn’t take long before their friendship turned into a romance.</p>
      <p>Mumford and Mulligan tied the knot in 2012 and <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-4988362/Carey-Mulligan-Marcus-Mumford-step-kids.html">have kids together</a>.</p>

      <p>Prince William and Kate Middleton were friends for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4RcE9G1MhM">over a year</a> before they <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8136695/Royal-Wedding-timeline-of-Prince-William-and-Kate-Middletons-modern-romance.html">became a couple.</a></p>

The pair dated for years before and briefly broke up <a href="https://parade.com/152491/parade/why-william-and-kate-broke-up-in-2007-and-why-they-got-back-together/">in the spring of 2007</a> before getting engaged in 2010.</p>
      <p>Middleton and Prince William <a href="https://www.royal.uk/wedding-prince-william-and-miss-catherine-middleton">married in April of 2011</a> and now have <a href="https://www.insider.com/differences-between-prince-harry-and-meghan-and-kate-and-will-2019-5#the-couples-publicly-show-affection-in-different-ways-and-in-varying-amounts-10">three children.</a></p>

      <p>After becoming friends, the two denied relationship reports over the years until they were <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g21991424/timeline-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-relationship/">spotted hanging out together in February of 2015</a>.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Bieber and Baldwin were spotted vacationing together, but things didn’t last long, and the two split up later that year.</p>
      <p>Bieber and Baldwin were spotted back together in May 2018, when the paparazzi caught the pair getting close on the streets in New York City. And the couple delighted fans when they <a href="https://people.com/music/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-relationship-timeline/">announced their engagement in July</a>.</p>
      <p>The two <a href="https://people.com/music/take-a-look-inside-hailey-baldwin-and-justin-biebers-whimsical-wedding-reception/">got married in 2019</a> and Baldwin changed her last name to Bieber.</p>

      <p>At the time, Burtka was in a long-distance relationship with someone in Los Angeles, California.</p>
      <p>At first, the pair hung out platonically with other friends in the city. “We had a lunch or so, but nothing romantic,” Burtka told Out.</p>
      <p>But Burtka ended up breaking up with his boyfriend, and a week later, he and Patrick Harris went on their first date together. “We started hanging out every single night, and after three months, it was just nonstop,” he said.</p>
      <p>The couple, who <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/65160-how-did-neil-patrick-harris-david-burtka-meet-they-were-at-a-certain-nyc-intersection">married in September 2014</a>, are now fathers to a pair of fraternal twins, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2153552/Neil-Patrick-Harris-explains-Oprah-odd-science-birth-twins.html">who they had via a surrogate in 2010</a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>When Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis played a couple in the hit sitcom “That ’70s Show,” the pair had no idea that they would end up together in real life.</p>
      <p>The series premiered in 1998 when <a href="https://people.com/tv/that-70s-show-20-year-anniversary/">Kunis was 14 and Kutcher was 19</a>. And although Kunis <a href="https://www.insider.com/stars-whose-first-kiss-was-filmed-for-tv-or-movies">shared her first kiss with her costar</a>, there were no signs of a romance back then.</p>
      <p>When the show <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/52360/end-of-that-70s-show-era">ended in 2006</a>, the two kept in touch though they were involved in other relationships.</p>
      <p><a href="https://people.com/movies/mila-kunis-macaulay-culkin-steady-relationship-horrible-split/">Kunis dated Macaulay Culkin</a> from 2002 to 2011, whereas <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/2017/07/162519/ashton-kutcher-cheating-mila-kunis-cousin">Kutcher was married to Demi Moore</a> from 2005 to 2013.</p>
      <p>Things changed for the couple when Kunis spotted a “<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mila-kunis-ashton-kutcher-reconnection_us_5b5f1d42e4b0b15aba9b15f1">really beautiful man</a>” – as the actress put it on an <a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-937-mila-kunis-iliza-shlesinger">episode of Marc Maron’s “WTF</a><a href="http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-937-mila-kunis-iliza-shlesinger">” podcast</a> – backstage at an awards show. To her surprise, Kunis said, she was checking out was her former costar and friend, Kutcher.</p>
      <p>The two reconnected, <a href="https://people.com/movies/mila-kunis-ashton-kutchers-marriage-demi-moore-was-normal/">married in 2015</a>, and have children together.</p>
