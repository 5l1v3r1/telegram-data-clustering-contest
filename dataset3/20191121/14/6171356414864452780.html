      <h1>Amazon Echo Flex wall-mountable smart speaker now available for $25</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:00:21+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/hagop-kavafian/" target="_blank">Hagop Kavafian</a></address>
      <p>Echo Dots are undoubtedly convenient, thanks to their compact size and the features they offer. However, they're designed to lie flat on a surface and don't easily fit if you'd rather place them on a wall plug. There are accessories that let you do that, but they're not necessarily ideal. Thankfully, Amazon <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/09/25/amazon-announces-new-echo-high-end-echo-studio-and-more-speakers/">announced</a> the Echo Flex wall-mountable smart speaker back in September, which is now selling on the retailer's site.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the Echo Flex, you'll be able to turn any socket into a smart speaker, without blocking the other outlet. The device is powered by Alexa and offers the same experience you'd get with a larger speaker.</p>
      <p>The built-in USB port allows you to plug an external device such as your phone to charge it, or even add optional accessories like a night-light or motion sensor, which cost an additional $15. Lastly, you can also use the deviceÂ to make announcements to other rooms that have a compatible Echo device and call others hands-free.</p>
