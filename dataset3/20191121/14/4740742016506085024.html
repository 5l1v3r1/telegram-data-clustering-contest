      <h1>Merry Xmas Everybody! Slade playing Bristol's O2 Academy just before Christmas</h1>
      <h2>We all know their song which is the ultimate way to get into the festive spirit</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:29:01+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author">Robin Murray</a></address>
      <p>There are plenty of ways to get in the festive spirit in Bristol this Christmas.</p>
      <p>You could visit the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/bristol-christmas-market-prices-broadmead-3517322">German market in Broadmead</a>, pop into the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/new-cinematic-experience-coming-bristol-3333946">fabulous spiegeltent</a> on the harbourside or head to the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/the-mall-winter-wonderland-christmas-3462941">winter wonderland at Cribbs Causeway</a>, to name just a few ideas.</p>
      <p>Or if you fancy a more raucous way to get in the mood, you could hear one of the greatest Christmas songs of all time performed live in the flesh by the legendary rock band who created it.</p>
      <p>British rockers Slade are performing at Bristol's O2 Academy just 10 days before <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas Day</a>.</p>
      <p>The gig will give people a chance to belt out best-selling single, <i>Merry Xmas Everybody</i>, along with the band and everyone else in the crowd.</p>
      <p>Other notable hits penned by the Wolverhampton outfit include <i>Far Far Away</i>,<i> Cum On Feel The Noize </i>and <i>My Oh My.</i></p>
      <p>Sadly, Slade will be performing in Bristol without enigmatic lead singer Noddy Holder, who left the band in 1992.</p>

      <p>Slade were formed in 1966 with original members Noddy and Jim Lea, but today the band is made up of Dave Hill, Don Powell, John Berry and Russell Keefe.</p>
      <p>The original lineup split in 1992 but the band re-formed later in the year as Slade II.</p>
      <h3>Tickets</h3>
      <p>Tickets for the gig on December 15 are priced at £28.35 and are available on <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/1F0056DBD066A364?_ga=2.137808631.610834341.1574327277-786031477.1570463750&amp;brand=o2academybristol&amp;camefrom=CFC_AMG_BRISTOL_sldjbr">Ticketmaster's website</a>.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the O2 Academy said: "Slade are without doubt one of the most iconic bands to come out of Britain and this Christmas they’ll be rocking out across the country on tour performing their much-loved hits."</p>
