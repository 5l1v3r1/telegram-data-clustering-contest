      <p>The poll, which is being run right now over at <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/entertainment/2019/11/battle-of-the-streaming-services-will-you-get-disney-plus-poll.html">Syracuse.com</a>, currently shows that 63.6% of viewers have already taken out a Disney+ subscription or currently plan to do so in the future.</p>

      <p>The result of the poll comes days after it was announced that more that <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/disney-racks-up-10-million-subs-in-24-hours-in-broadside-blow-to-netflix-update">10 million people had signed up</a> to the new streaming service within its first 24 hours, with Disney's vast library of movies and TV shows, as well as affordable price point, winning people over.</p>
      <p>So far T3 has been very impressed with Disney Plus, despite a few technical issues and teething problems (we can't wait for The Simpsons letterbox fix in early 2020), and have high hopes for the service going forward. As a one-stop-shop for great content, with Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, and Disney entertainment on tap, it Disney+ could soon be the first subscription many consider, as it has content for all the family.</p>
      <p>Plus, as massive fans of the original Star Wars films, the fact that with Disney Plus you can <a href="https://www.t3.com/news/disney-plus-star-wars-films-available-in-4k-hdr10-with-dolby-atmos-audio">watch them in 4K, HDR10 and with Dolby Atmos audio</a> is just fantastic.</p>
      <p>For a brace of great sign-up offers available right now, check out the deals below, with one delivering a great price on Disney+ alone, and the other delivering a great bundle deal with ESPN+ and Hulu.</p>

      <p><b>Disney+ </b><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><b>| $6.99 per month</b></a><b><br/></b>Disney Plus on its own costs a very affordable $6.99 per month, and as part of the initial sign-up deal you get a 7-day free trial, too. This grants you access to all the movies and TV show content that Disney Plus has to offer.<br/><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">VIEW DEAL</a></p>

      <p><b>Disney+ | Hulu | ESPN+ </b><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/"><b>| $12.99 per month</b></a><b><br/></b>This is the best launch bundle deal available for Disney+, delivering the hot new streaming service along with full access to Hulu and ESPN+ for just $12.99 per month. That's thousands of movies, TV shows, channels and live sports events, for one affordable price point. Indeed, when you consider that the standard Netflix plan costs $12.99 per month on its own, and delivers none of the Hulu or ESPN+ content, as well as a fraction of the Disney programming, the stunning value of this deal really becomes evident.<br/><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/">VIEW DEAL</a></p>
