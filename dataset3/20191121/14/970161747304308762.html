      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> has revealed she didn’t find her stolen engagement ring after posing with a stunning replica.</p>
      <p>Calm down everyone.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star had the ring given to her by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/29/kanye-west-reveals-feels-like-married-kim-kardashian-100-years-awe-11003291/">who she married in 2014</a>, stolen during a 2016 trip to Paris.</p>
      <p>However, everyone was left baffled when she appeared to pose for an ad campaign while wearing the very ring everyone thought was missing.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, there’s a pretty simple explanation.</p>

      <p>‘I borrowed all jewellery from Lorraine Schwartz,’ she <a href="https://www.etonline.com/kim-kardashian-explains-the-return-of-her-massive-engagement-ring-as-skims-restock-arrives">told Entertainment Tonight</a>. ‘It was nice to borrow it all and it was nice to give it back to her.’</p>
      <p>The 39-year-old added: ‘That was a really fun shoot and because it was diamonds, I thought this was the perfect way to bring it back and wear them again.’</p>

      <p>Kim also explained she sometimes borrows fake versions of the ring from Lorraine, who made the original, saying: ‘There is a replica around. A little fake that I’ll borrow from her sometimes that she made. A really nice one. It looks really nice.’</p>
      <p>The horrific Paris robbery <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/14/kim-kardashian-says-traumatic-paris-robbery-changed-whole-life-10914933/">saw Kim being held at gunpoint, with $10 million (£7.7 million) of her jewelry being stolen.</a></p>
      <p>She recently recalled the ordeal during an episode of E! True Hollywood Story, revealing it’s the most scared she’s been in her life.</p>

      <p>‘That 10 minutes really changed my whole life,’ she said. ‘Right as I was about to fall asleep, I heard guys running up the stairs. They wanted my ring and my jewellery, so I didn’t fight back.</p>
      <p>‘I just gave them everything and they tied me up.</p>
      <p>‘They wrapped duct tape over my eyes and my mouth. It was the scariest thing I’ve ever been through in my entire life, just thinking, you know, you’re about to die.</p>
      <p>‘You’re just kind of bracing yourself for the moment that they’re going to shoot and kill you.’</p>
