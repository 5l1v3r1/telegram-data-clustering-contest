      <p>Labour has laid its education funding cards on the table, pledging to pump billions of pounds into the school system over the next three years.</p>
      <p>The party plans to increase spending in England’s schools by £10.5 billion by 2022/23, according to newly published documents.</p>
      <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), a respected economic think tank, said that Labour’s proposals would mean a 15% real-terms increase in per pupil funding over the next three years.</p>
      <p>The Government announced in the summer that it would increase school spending by £7.1 billion by 2022/23, an almost 8% increase that would return funding to 2009/10 levels, according to the IFS.</p>
      <p>Labour’s manifesto says that its funding settlement “will ensure pupils are taught by a qualified teacher, that every school is open for a full five days a week, and maximum class sizes of 30 for all primary school children. We will also fund more non-contact time for teachers to prepare and plan”.</p>
      <p>The School Cuts coalition, a group of education union, has welcomed Labour’s funding pledge.</p>
      <p>It said: “With this announcement, Labour has now committed to a plan that reverses the cuts to education; provides additional money to properly address historic underfunding; and makes it possible for all schools to ensure minimum standards of educational provision are in place such as a class size limit of 30 and a qualified teacher for every class.”</p>
      <p>The manifesto is also set to deepen divisions between Labour and private schools, as it sets out measures to cut tax breaks for the sector.</p>
      <p>A row was sparked in September after the party passed a resolution at its conference which put forward sweeping plans to overhaul private education and “integrate” fee-paying schools into the state sector.</p>
      <p>The move was immediately met with outrage from private school leaders, who have vowed to fight any such move.</p>
      <p>Labour’s manifesto says that the party intends to “close the tax loopholes enjoyed by elite private schools and use that money to improve the lives of all children”.</p>
      <p>The party also pledges to ask the Social Justice Commission “to advise on integrating private schools and creating a comprehensive education system”.</p>

      <p>Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC), which represents about 250 leading private schools, said: “Independent schools already contribute significantly to local and national economies, including paying their taxes.</p>
      <p>“Any further tax is putting politics before pupils and will have serious unforeseen consequences.</p>
      <p>“It will hurt hard-working parents, drive up class sizes and pile further pressure on state school budgets.</p>
      <p>“We are particularly worried about the effects on vulnerable children.”</p>
      <aside>Labour will end the failed free-market experiment in higher education, abolish tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants<cite>Labour manifesto</cite></aside>
      <p>Other education measures in Labour’s manifesto, some of which are already known, focus on the party’s plans to create a national education service.</p>
      <p>The party is pledging to give all two to four-year-olds 30 hours of free pre-school education, recruit almost 150,000 additional early years workers, scrap primary school SATs and Ofsted and increase funding for post-16 education.</p>
      <p>Also included is Labour’s key pledge to scrap university tuition fees.</p>
      <p>The manifesto says: “Labour will end the failed free-market experiment in higher education, abolish tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.”</p>
      <p>New analysis by the IFS calculates that the total cost of Labour’s higher education policies would be around £7 billion per year, assuming no changes in student numbers.</p>
      <p>Jack Britton, IFS senior research economist, said: “Labour’s plans will largely benefit students who go on to have the highest earnings.</p>
      <p>“If student numbers stayed constant, they would cost the taxpayer £7 billion per year.</p>
      <p>“But it is plausible that free higher education would increase student numbers, and hence student number caps may have to be re-introduced to avoid costs rising in an uncontrolled fashion.</p>
      <p>“But this would risk harming access to higher education among those from poorer backgrounds.”</p>
