      <h2>“I don’t get an allowance from my parents, my mum just gives me money whenever I ask for it"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:28:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:28</time> by <a rel="author">Vickie Scullard, Emma Flanagan</a></address>
      <p>An heiress to a self-made oil baron claims she spends £1500 a month on taxis as "walking is for peasants" and will easily spend £1000 on a night out with friends.</p>
      <p>Nadia Nuseibeh, 24, is appearing on Rich Kids Go Skint and the unemployed socialite will no doubt be shocked to come face to face with single mum Natalie who is raising her two boys in a rented two-bed flat.</p>
      <p>Nadia is swapping her extravagant lifestyle, where she orders food to be delivered up to four times a day, and asks her mum for money whenever she needs it, reports the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/rich-kids-go-skint-heiress-17291841">Manchester Evening News</a>.</p>
      <p>However, she decided to swap her privileged life for a short stay with a family who struggle financially for the 5Star show as she is at "a crossroads" in her life.</p>
      <p>She tells the show: “I don’t get an allowance from my parents, my mum just gives me money whenever I ask for it. <br/><br/>“I am currently unemployed, I am doing nothing, I am running out of things to do. <br/><br/>“I spend maybe £1,500 on taxis per month. Walking is for peasants.”</p>

      <p>Nadia's new home, as part of the show, is with 40-year-old Natalie, 16-year-old Kaliel and 11-year-old Ilai. Natalie works 16 hours a week and is on Universal Credit and has £50 a week to spend on food for the whole family.</p>
      <p>Natalie, who lives in Bournemouth, opened up on the show: "I ended up homeless at 15 and then I ended up in prison. I overdosed at the age of 18 and when I started to turn things around, I was pregnant with Kaliel and it was so scary for me."</p>
      <p>Despite the pair’s different lives, they struck up a surprise bond, with Nadia - who insists she has a “phobia” of tap water - saying her expectations were “blown out of the park” after admitting she feared she would be staying at a “dirty” home.</p>

      <p>She said: "I felt more emotional in the past couple of days than I have in a really long time.</p>
      <p>"In my world you have to pretend that everything is perfect all the time and you're laughing and you go for drinks.</p>
      <p>"You're kinda living in this fake perfect La La Land where no one talks about problems or emotional struggles.</p>
      <p>"And everything they talk about is the economy or what the next trend is or what restaurant to eat at."</p>
      <p>As she left the home, Nadia gave her children JD Sports vouchers worth £100 each, while Natalie was offered £100.</p>
