      <h1>Priyanka Gandhi on withdrawal of SPG cover: ‘Part of politics, keeps happening’</h1>
      <h2>On Wednesday, Union Minister J P Naddahad said there was "nothing political" in the withdrawal of the SPG cover and the decision was taken by the Home Ministry.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:19:28+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-web-desk/" target="_blank">Express Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>In her first remarks on the Centre’s decision to withdraw Special Protection Group (SPG) for the Gandhi family, Congress general secretary <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-gandhi/">Priyanka Gandhi</a> Vadra Thursday downplayed it saying, “That’s a part of politics, it keeps happening.”</p>
      <p>The Centre had downgraded the Gandhis’ security cover earlier this month to CRPF Z-plus. They had been under SPG cover since the assassination of former prime minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rajiv-gandhi">Rajiv Gandhi</a> in 1991.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, Union Minister J P Naddahad said there was “nothing political” in the withdrawal of the SPG cover and the decision was taken by the Home Ministry.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing political. The Home Ministry has a very set pattern, and there is a protocol. This is not done by a politician, it is done by the Home Ministry,” Nadda said, amid chaos in the House. “According to the threat perception, security is given and withdrawn,” he added.</p>
      <p>The Congress members on Tuesday raised the issue in Lok Sabha, protesting against the removal of SPG cover. Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, during the Zero Hour, said, “There is a threat to the lives of our leaders.”</p>
      <p>Former prime minister <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/manmohan-singh">Manmohan Singh</a>’s cover was also reduced two months ago. Sources told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a> the decision came after the government identified “gaps that raise concern“.</p>
