      <p>The NFL upheld <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/cleveland-browns">Browns</a> defensive lineman Larry Ogunjobi’s one-game suspension for his role in the Cleveland-Pittsburgh Steelers brawl last week.</p>
      <p>The NFL made the decision on Wednesday after hearing Ogunjobi’s appeal. The league is still deciding on appeals from Browns defensive end <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/myles-garrett">Myles Garrett</a> and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> center Maurkice Pouncey.</p>

      <p>Garrett was involved in a fight with Steelers quarterback <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> toward the end of their game last week. Garrett ripped Rudolph’s helmet and hit him in the head with it.</p>
      <p>Ogunjobi wasn’t involved in the fight, which also saw Pouncey punch and kick Garrett in the helmet when he was down on the ground. However, he did get a late shot in on Rudolph, who had walked away angrily from the scrum.</p>
