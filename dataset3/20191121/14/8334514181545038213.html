      <p>DUBLIN (Reuters) - Sixteen people were discovered on Thursday in a sealed trailer on a passenger ferry traveling to Ireland from France and all are in good health, Swedish ferry operator Stena Line said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The group was discovered during a routine inspection on board a ferry traveling from the French port of Cherbourg to Rosslare in Ireland, a Stena Line spokesman said.</p>
      <p>The vessel was due to arrive in Ireland at 15:30 GMT and immigration authorities have been alerted, he said, without giving any further details.</p>
      <p>On Oct. 23, 39 bodies, all believed to be Vietnamese migrants, were discovered in the back of a refrigerated truck near London. Two people have been charged in Britain and eight in Vietnam over the deaths.</p>
      <p>Dutch authorities on Tuesday found 25 migrants stowed away on a cargo ferry bound for Britain shortly after it left the Netherlands.</p>
