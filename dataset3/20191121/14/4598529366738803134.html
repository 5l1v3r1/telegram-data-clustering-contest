      <p>It’s getting to him.</p>
      <p>In the hours leading up to the fifth day of impeachment hearings, President Trump threw a tantrum in a series of tweets Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>The President’s Thursday morning tweets mainly took aim at what he calls a “phony impeachment hoax” and labeled Democrats “human scum.”</p>
      <p>Trump doubled down on his <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-reaction-sondland-testimony">reaction</a> to the public testimony of EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, which Trump said was “fantastic” and proved that he “did absolutely nothing wrong,” despite how Sondland’s testimony was damning.</p>

      <p>Trump also appeared to reference a call between himself and Sondland in which Trump allegedly asked about the status of “investigations.”</p>

      <p>Trump then pivoted to railing against former Special Counsel Bob Mueller.</p>

      <p>A few minutes later, Trump went back to tweeting about the impeachment hearings and reiterated his argument that “the calls (transcripts) were perfect, there was nothing said that was wrong.”</p>

      <p>The President then elaborated on the “great corruption and dishonesty” by House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-CA).</p>
