      <p>A long-term deal with an America brewery comes with a big role for Burton over the next 15 years.</p>
      <p>The Marston's Beer Company has reached a long-term trade agreement with Shipyard Brewing Co, which is based in Portland, Maine, to produce one of their beers in the UK.</p>
      <p>The new multi-million-pound agreement for 15 years follows a previous successful contract and means the two companies will now be working together until 2034.</p>
      <p>It comes as good news for workers in the Burton Marston's factory, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">in Shobnall Road,</a> as they will be responsible for managing the packaging of bottles and cans.</p>
      <p>Tom Spencer, site manager at Marston's Brewery, said: "The long-term commitment between Marston's and Shipyard is fantastic news.</p>
      <p>"The packaging of bottles and cans for Shipyard takes place right here at Burton and we will continue to manage this for the next 15 years."</p>
      <p>It comes after Shipyard co-founder Fred Forsley visited Marston's head office to sign the deal, according to <a href="https://www.thebusinessdesk.com/westmidlands/news/2035764-marston%e2%80%99s-signs-multimillion-pound-pre-brexit-deal-with-us-brewing-company?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=WestMidlands_20th_Nov_2019_Daily">The Business Desk.com.</a></p>
      <p>The collaboration already has a 12-year history and has proved successful, as the popularity of the American-styled craft beers has grown in the UK.</p>
      <p>Shipyard American Pale Ales is the first beer to be brewed solely in the UK for Shipyard.</p>
      <p>It is now the UK's biggest-selling craft keg beer and Shipyard Indian Pale Ale is still growing.</p>
      <p>In June 2019, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/business">Marston's launched Low Tide</a>, Shipyard's first low-alcohol alternative in the UK market.</p>
      <p>Mr Forsley told the Business Desk said: "This new commitment is a fantastic news, a dream come true for Shipyard in that we continue to work with a business which has become our extended family â€“ walking into pubs and seeing our beers on the bar or in supermarkets in the UK is a huge buzz.</p>
      <p>"Marston's is a great business partner and our relationship runs very deep. Our long-term plans are exciting and we are both looking long into the future which allows us to focus on the beer and not on contract durations."</p>
      <p>Richard Westwood, managing director of the Marston's Beer Company, told how the Marston's and Shipyard partnership had been a real success for the brewing industry which is a testament to the close working relationship.</p>
