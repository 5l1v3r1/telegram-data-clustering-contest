      <h1>Jacoby Ellsbury isn’t giving up on comeback after Yankees cut</h1>

      <p>Try and stifle your laughter.</p>
      <p>Jacoby Ellsbury’s time with the Yankees is over <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/20/yankees-strongly-consider-releasing-jacoby-ellsbury/">after they cut him on Wednesday night</a>, but he still envisions playing in the big leagues in 2020. Ellsbury has not played since the 2017 ALCS, thanks to a variety of injuries, including hip surgery at the end of the 2018 season.</p>
      <p>So, where exactly is Ellsbury now?</p>
      <p>“He’s finishing up his rehab [in Arizona] with a focus on Spring Training,”<a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/jacoby-ellsbury-what-next"> a source close to the outfielder told MLB.com.</a> “I’m sure he will [try to play in 2020].”</p>
      <p>It may sound unlikely to any Yankees fan who has waited for two years for the 36-year-old to come out of hibernation. He does provide one advantage, though, that the Yankees will never know. He’ll be cheap.</p>
      <p>The Yankees have to pay Ellsbury the final $21 million of his $153 million contract in 2020, so any team who wants to take a flier on the outfielder would likely be getting him at a minimum price.</p>
      <p>“It’s a freebie for someone,” one AL executive said.</p>
