      <p>Binance.US, <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/binance-us-will-launch-in-a-matter-of-weeks-ceo-says/">the American branch</a> of the Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced this Thursday that it has partnered with Tagomi in order to provide liquidity for its cross-exchange trading platform.</p>
      <p>Tagomi is a broker focused on institutional investors. Under the agreement, customers of the broker, which are largely quant funds, venture funds, family offices, IRAs and HNWI will have extra access to Binance’s select trading pairs.</p>

      <p>Binance.US is not the first exchange to join Tagomi. In fact, it is the 15th exchange, alongside a number of over-the-counter (OTC) desks, both based in the United States and abroad.</p>
      <p>As part of the collaboration, Binance.US, as a liquidity partner, will offer the broker’s institutional traders increased access to on-demand liquidity for a range of digital assets.</p>
      <p>The partnership with Tagomi is part of a larger plan from Binance.US to gain additional momentum through collaborations that bring additional liquidity and broader access to the American marketplace.</p>

      <p>To learn more about this partnership, <i>Finance Magnates </i>caught up with Binance.US CEO, Catherine Coley. When asked why the American digital asset platform chose Tagomi, she said: “As a liquidity partner, Tagomi was the clear choice. Binance.US is intent on eliminating the barriers to entry for crypto investors, new and experienced. </p>
      <p>“Tagomi offers users the lowest prices possible on select trading pairs, allowing Binance.US to offer institutional traders on Tagomi’s platform increased access to on-demand liquidity. The partnership with Tagomi furthers our mission to make the U.S. a global leader in the growth of the digital asset market.”</p>
      <p>However, Tagomi isn’t the only partnership the exchange has on the horizon. In fact, Binance.US is “aggressively” seeking strategic partnerships which will allow the exchange to educate and cultivate the American crypto landscape whilst also making virtual currencies more accessible for the American user, Coley added.</p>
      <p>“Access is key,” she continued. “We want to provide significant liquidity pools through partnerships, lower all barriers to entry and keep fees low as to incentivize traders from both the retail and institutional sides of the equation. </p>
      <p>“To achieve mainstream adoption and develop a healthy trading ecosystem, we have to remove the roadblocks that have kept people from investing. To that end, we are promoting programs that focus on cryptocurrency education, inclusion and access.”</p>
