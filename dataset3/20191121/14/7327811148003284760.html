      <p>MELROSE, Bronx (WABC) -- Police are working to determine if a deadly shooting inside a tobacco shop in the Bronx started as an armed robbery.</p>
      <p>It happened just after 11 p.m. Wednesday on East 167th Street just east of the Grand Concourse in the Melrose section.</p>
      <p>Two people were shot. One of them is dead.</p>
      <p>"We feel so sorry for his family, we feel sorry for ourselves," said shop owner J. J. Ali. "We lost the great man in this whole 'hood."</p>
      <p>23-year-old Kashka Richards was well known to J. J. Ali. "Kush," as he was known, worked odd jobs in the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>Now family and friends are mourning his loss.</p>

      <p>"This great man, running for his life," said Ali. "And somebody chased him, started shooting at the store."</p>
      <p>Crime scene investigators were at the store collecting evidence all night.</p>
      <p>Officers were first called to the scene shortly after 11 p.m. for the report of a 32-year-old man shot in the leg.</p>
      <p>That man survived.</p>
      <p>But officers discovered Richards' body in the back of the store. He was dead from a gunshot wound to the head.</p>
      <p>"He was trying to survive," said Ali. "He was running for his life. That's what my worker told me, because my worker was behind the counter."</p>
      <p>Police say this may have started as an armed robbery. A ski mask was left behind.</p>
      <p>The shooter is still out there, and so is the gun.</p>
      <p>"It's just crazy how the bad guys are walking around right now as we speak with a gun, concealed," said neighbor Sidney Flores. "And now that winter's here, you don't know who's carrying a gun with these big coats."</p>
      <p>Police say they do have a suspect in mind.</p>
      <p>Investigators are no strangers to this block, telling Eyewitness News that police have been called to this same area for gang activity in the past.</p>
