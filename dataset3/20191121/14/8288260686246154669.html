      <p>Caitlyn Jenner’s daughters Kylie and Kendall are still ignoring I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! as they fail to show support.</p>
      <p>Jenner is one of 12 campmates on the ITV1 reality show, which also features Ian Wright, James Haskell and Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>The star is being paid £500,000 to appear on the series, which is hosted by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.</p>
      <p>Myles Stephenson, Adele Roberts, Roman Kemp, Kate Garraway, Nadine Coyle, Andy Whyment and Cliff Parisi are also in the camp.</p>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell completes the line-up.</p>

      <p>None of Caitlyn's family have publicly discussed or supported her during her time on the ITV show.</p>
      <p>One fan wrote on Twitter: "I’m not saying that you have to put anything on social media to prove you care etc but not one of @Caitlyn_Jenner’s family members have said anything about her stint on #ImACeleb and its bothering the hell out of me."</p>
      <p>"Its literally breaking my heart that not a single member of Caitlyns family appear to be supporting her (sic). You're doing great Caitlyn! I am rooting for you!!" a second added.</p>
      <p>"Are the Kardashian/Jenner clan even going to acknowledge <a href="https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner">@Caitlyn_Jenner</a> being in the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImaCeleb?src=hash">#ImaCeleb</a> jungle orrr.....?" asked a third.</p>

      <p>Last night, Jenner said she was enjoying having people do things for her on I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p>The US star competed in the American version of the series in 2003, when she was still Bruce, and is now on the ITV series of the show.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jenner, who came out as a trans women in 2015, told her campmates it was nice having people do things like cook for her.</p>
      <p>"The last time I was in here, old Bruce, I was doing everything for everybody," she said.</p>
