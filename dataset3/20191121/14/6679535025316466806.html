      <p>Stakeholders from government departments and NGOs across the State took part in a district-level public dialogue on ‘Child trafficking free India’ at the Collectorate here on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The programme was organised by Rural Organisation for Social Education and Development (ROSED) and Nether’s Economic and Educational Development Society (NEEDS).</p>
      <p>Speaking at the event, A. Thameemunisa, District Social Welfare Officer, Tiruchi, said the sex ratio in the State was 954 females per 1,000 males. “Although it may look promising, the numbers are dropping by the day. If left unnoticed, it will continue to drop further.”</p>
      <p>M. Geetha, District Child Protection Officer, Tiruchi, said the Child Protection Unit had two objectives — to protect children and ensure that they were law-abiding.</p>
      <p>P. Azeem, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Anti-child trafficking unit, urged the gathering to inform the police of any suspicious activities involving children. “All residents must have the nearest police station’s phone number and alert them in the event of any wrongdoing,” she said.</p>
      <p>P. Mohan, Member, Tamil Nadu Commission for Protection of Child Rights, P. Rajagopal, State convenor, Child-Friendly India-Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, took part in the event along with representatives of 13 volunteer organisations.</p>
      <p>The meeting concluded with the formation of a ‘child-friendly’ district-level committee for protection of child rights.</p>
      <p>Similar meetings would be held across the State, the organisers said.</p>
