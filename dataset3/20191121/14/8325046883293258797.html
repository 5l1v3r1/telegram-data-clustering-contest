      <p>Millennials are getting older – but they’re still nothing like their parents.</p>
      <p>The Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/defining-generations-where-millennials-end-and-post-millennials-begin/">defines this generation</a> as people born between 1981 and 1996, meaning the last millennials graduated college this spring.</p>
      <p>Millennials are now full-fledged adults – but they <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-millennials-gen-x-and-baby-boomers-approach-marriage-2017-11">marry later</a>, have more <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-last-graduating-class-affordability-crisis-student-loans-housing-2019-5">student loan debt</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-cost-of-living-compared-to-gen-x-baby-boomers-2018-5">delay homebuying</a>.</p>
      <p>Below, we rounded up some more ways millennials do things differently than their parents. Read on to find out how this much-maligned generation is changing life as we know it.</p>

      <h3>Instead of preparing meals, millennials are more likely to order takeout.</h3>

      <p>The food industry is responding to major shifts in the way young people eat.</p>
      <p>Business Insider’s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-millennials-eating-habits-differ-from-baby-boomers-2018-3">Akin Oyedele reported</a> that millennials spent the least amount of time on meal preparation compared to older generations. Instead, they’re more likely to eat at restaurants, pick up prepared meals, or order delivery.</p>

      <h3>Instead of drinking beer, millennials prefer wine and spirits.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Millennials are drinking less alcohol than older generations in general. But when they do drink, they prefer wine and spirits to beer.</p>
      <p>Citing Nielsen data, Business Insider’s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-beer-chart-2017-8">Kate Taylor reported</a> that beer penetration in the US market fell by 1% from 2016 to 2017 while wine and spirits stayed the same. UBS and Goldman Sachs have also found that millennials are less interested than previous generations in beer.</p>

      <h3>Instead of attending lectures, millennials want to learn online.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>It’s screens versus lectures.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-learn-from-tech-not-people-2017-8">Business Insider reported</a> on <a href="https://growingleaders.com/blog/survey-millennials-learn-more-from-technology-than-from-people/">a survey</a> in which 69% of people 18 to 34 years old said they thought they learned more from technology than from people, compared with 50% of respondents older than 45 who said the same.</p>

      <h3>Instead of keeping their salary secret, millennials may share it with coworkers.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Money is becoming less taboo.</p>
      <p>Business Insider <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-breaking-the-one-big-salary-taboo-reasons-why-2017-12">previously reported</a> that millennials were more likely than older generations to discuss their salary with coworkers, family, and friends.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thecashlorette.com/millennial-money/who-shares-salary-information/">One recent survey</a> found that 30% of millennials (defined as ages 18 to 36) said they had discussed their pay with coworkers, compared with just 8% of baby boomers (ages 53 to 71).</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Instead of waiting for an annual performance review, millennials crave more frequent feedback.</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/06/06/5d07db1b6fc9203a8b055062.png"/>

      </figure>
      <p>The annual performance review is slowly disappearing.</p>
      <p>IBM, for example, ditched it for a system called Checkpoint, through which feedback is given on at least a quarterly basis. The company also uses <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-now-uses-the-ace-app-to-give-and-receive-real-time-feedback-2016-5">an app called ACE</a> to facilitate a more casual, ongoing dialogue among employees.</p>
      <p>Experts say these changes reflect a shift in how millennials think about delivering and receiving feedback.</p>
      <p>Samantha Klein, a former representative of IBM’s Millennial Corps, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ibms-millennial-corps-key-things-young-workers-need-from-bosses-2016-4">told Business Insider</a> that millennials “don’t want an annual review.”</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to wait until the end of the year to hear about what we’ve done right or wrong, what we can improve upon,” Klein said.</p>

      <h3>Even generally, millennials are better about talking about their money than their parents were.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Nearly half of millennials discuss personal finance with their parents, while just 24% of baby boomers discuss money with their kids. Thirty percent of millennials discuss money with their friends, compared to just 9% of boomers.</p>

      <h3>Instead of moving in together after getting married, many millennials cohabitate beforehand.</h3>

      <p>For many young adults today, a key comes <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-millennials-gen-x-and-baby-boomers-approach-marriage-2017-11">before a ring</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.barna.com/research/majority-of-americans-now-believe-in-cohabitation/#.V5T7OqJ-dAN">One survey</a> found that 72% of millennials believe cohabitation before marriage is a good idea, compared with 63% of baby boomers.</p>
      <p>Insider’s <a href="http://www.insider.com/millennial-marriage-divorce-rate-2016-09">Kim Renfro reported</a> that some sociologists think there could be a link between declining divorce rates and more people deciding to live together before marriage. Presumably, that’s because people have a longer window of time to realize whether they’re compatible.</p>

      <h3>Instead of buying starter homes, millennials are waiting until they can afford bigger houses.</h3>

      <p>Yes, millennials are interested in buying homes, just like previous generations. But they’re renting longer, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-dont-buy-starter-homes-2017-10">waiting it out</a> until they can afford the real deal.</p>
      <p>On an episode of Business Insider’s podcast, “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/zillow-ceo-spencer-rascoff-success-how-i-did-it-2017-10">Success! How I Did It</a>,” Spencer Rascoff, the CEO of the real-estate website and app Zillow, broke it down for our US editor-in-chief, Alyson Shontell:</p>
      <blockquote>“Homebuilders really only build high-end houses now. It’s very difficult for a builder to get it to pencil to build a 2,500-square-foot, 2,000-square-foot, 1,500-square-foot starter home, because they can just make so much more money building a 6,000-square-foot-plus home.”</blockquote>
      <p>As a result, Rascoff said, home prices shoot up, leaving minimal inventory at the middle and low end of the housing market – and causing many millennials to end up renting into their 30s.</p>

      <p>About 20% more millennials use Netflix to watch TV compared to Gen Xers.</p>
      <p>More Gen X viewers watch TV shows produced by television networks, while half of millennials watch Netflix original shows, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-millennials-and-gen-x-watch-tv-study-2017-9">Business Insider’s Carrie Wittmer reported</a>.</p>

      <h3>Instead of moving into golf communities, rich millennials are joining ‘agrihoods.’</h3>

      <p>That’s short for “agricultural neighborhoods.”</p>
      <p>Business Insider’s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/agrihoods-golf-communities-millennial-homebuyers-2017-10">Tanza Loudenback reported</a> that “agrihoods could become the 21st-century version of those tony golf communities baby boomers flocked to in the 1990s.”</p>
      <p>Experts say that’s because millennials may be more interested than older generations in societal impact – and agrihoods are designed to help them do good for the environment and their community.</p>

      <h3>Instead of asking friends and family for parenting advice, millennials turn to Google</h3>

      <p>Paging Dr. Google!</p>
      <p>Millennial parents, a group <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/style/millennial-parents-parennials.html?_r=0#nws=mcnewsletter">The New York Times labeled</a> “parennials,” are <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-turn-to-the-internet-for-parenting-advice-2017-11">less likely to turn to friends and family for advice</a> than older generations. Instead, they search for answers themselves online.</p>
      <p>Depending on how you look at it, that can be a good thing in that they’re highly informed – or a bad thing in that so much information can be overwhelming.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>‘Parennials’ also use social media to document their kids’ lives.</h3>

      <p>About 4 in 5 millennials admit to posting a picture of their kid online at least once, according to a poll conducted by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/differences-millennial-gen-x-baby-boomer-parents-2017-11">TIME and Survey Monkey</a>. Half of baby boomers, meanwhile, have never posted a photo of their kids online, as well as 30% of Gen X parents.</p>

      <h3>Instead of traditional asset classes, millennials are investing in more sophisticated assets.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Many millennials came of age during the 2008 financial crisis. As <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-investing-market-us-trust-2017-6">Oyedele pointed out</a>, they have “memories of traditional asset classes like stocks cratering and retirement savings being wiped out.”</p>
      <p>That’s most likely why, according to a US Trust survey, millennials are more interested in “sophisticated” assets like structured products, venture capital, and private equity.</p>
      <p>That way, they can hit their near-term financial goals (think: paying down debt) and invest in companies that do good for society – two common objectives among millennials.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>Instead of shopping at department stores, millennials are dressing in so-called fast fashion.</h3>

All three chains are closing stores, Business Insider’s Hayley Peterson has reported.</p>
      <p>Business Insider’s <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-are-killing-list-2017-8#department-stores-like-macys-and-sears-15">Kate Taylor reported</a> that the closures are partly due to millennials not buying from aspirational, designer brands but from private-label lines and fast-fashion brands like H&amp;M and Zara.</p>
