      <p>MOSCOW: The Kremlin on Thursday distanced itself from a video showing four Russian-speaking men torturing, stabbing and beheading a Syrian man in 2017 and said the incident had nothing to do with Russia's military.<br/>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he had not seen the footage, but said: "I am certain that this has no relation to Russian military operations in Syria."<br/>Part of the video, obtained by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, first appeared in June 2017, before new recordings emerged this month.<br/>The gruesome footage shows a man being beaten with a sledgehammer and decapitated with a spade before being strung up by his legs and his body set on fire.<br/>Earlier this month, Arabic news outlet Jesr Press identified the victim as Mohammed Taha Ismail Al-Abdullah, a Syrian national.<br/>The men responsible recorded their own video footage and made jokes as they dismembered the body.<br/>When asked whether the Kremlin would look into the footage, given that it involved Russian speakers, Peskov said the Kremlin is not an investigative body.<br/>Reuters has previously reported that Russia secretly used private military contractors in Syria to carry out missions in support of Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad, Moscow's ally, in coordination with the Russian military.<br/>Russia denies using military contractors in Syria and says any Russian civilians there are volunteers.<br/>Peskov said the Kremlin does not have information about the work of private companies and that he saw no risk of reputational damage to Russia because of the video.<br/>"I can only talk about the actions and activities of Russian armed forces and units that act under orders from the Supreme commander."</p>
