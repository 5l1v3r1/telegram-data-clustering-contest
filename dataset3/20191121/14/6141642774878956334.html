      <p>A council has sparked confusion by creating a 16ft ski-ing marmot, nicknamed “Marmite”, as the centre of its Christmas lights display.</p>
      <p>Alton Town Council has spent £20,000 on the display, which has the giant Alpine rodent as its centrepiece.</p>

      <p>Emma English wrote on the council’s Facebook page: “I just don’t understand! Whatever it is, it has no relevance to Christmas, it’s embarrassing and just plain ugly. I struggled to like the Christmas hat we had last year but this is another low.”</p>
      <p>Carole Samuda added: “I could understand it if we had some connection to ski-ing but it seems a bit of an odd thing for Alton to have.”</p>
      <p>But others were more supportive, with Caroline Wren saying: “I think it’s fantastic, the children of Alton will love this and Christmas is for them after all.”</p>

      <p>A council spokeswoman said the design was chosen “to bring a smile to people’s faces, particularly the children”.</p>
      <p>She added: “We realised that people were really keen to take selfies with it and it was definitely a talking point.</p>
      <p>“Marmite this year is most certainly a talking point and has had over 25,000 views on our Facebook page alone.”</p>
