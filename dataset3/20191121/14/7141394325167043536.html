      <h1>‘Alarmist’ Emissions Argument Against Bitcoin (BTC) and Crypto Overblown, New Research Suggests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:05:03+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin mining’s carbon emission levels are not nearly as drastic as previously reported, new research suggests.</p>
      <p>Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol, researchers at Aalborg University in Denmark, recently released new <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.est.9b05687">research</a> that indicates Bitcoin mining last year had a total carbon emission footprint roughly equivalent to that of Estonia, according to a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2224037-bitcoins-climate-change-impact-may-be-much-smaller-than-we-thought/">summary</a> of the findings published in New Scientist.</p>
      <p>In 2018 Bitcoin mining as a whole consumed about 31.29 terawatt-hours of electricity and generated about 17.29 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent.</p>
      <p>This falls on the lower end of previous estimates, including a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-018-0321-8.epdf?referrer_access_token=y9NTf6Z87XwoLtFIrNHFb9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0N_BlBOQJDHfvssdGkz36RFYyoo37fn7K3l9S2tLAjNcg_0LB6tK4qPuTOPXwFxt1BJqOCBNAFYkd6aAesQ0uggPhx6-PSfeMKqYhm5mn44D2XyWMtxOxYaJwYb9HBju6YxjGsI7PKhIm0wOiM48ocoNIRPac01cvcw4iR2oNusaGyPTHKCjYX-B3voNpj_3oXomNk0pxfm2jdeqw31AxOCuLC63PulHpoNpM4iyyeZ6y8wAOeNBLaMDFEDG4exC1mskLKzvqxhIZomKuHaq3P8&amp;tracking_referrer=www.newscientist.com">report</a> in Nature that claimed Bitcoin mining alone could sabotage the climate-change-reduction goals that were set by world leaders at the Paris Agreement.</p>
      <p>Köhler says the environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining shouldn’t be overstated or ignored.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“On the one hand we have these alarmist voices saying we won’t hit the Paris agreement because of Bitcoin only. But on the other hand there are a lot of voices from the Bitcoin community saying that most of the mining is done with green energy and that it’s not high impact.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“In contrast to previous studies, it was found that the service life, production, and end-of-life of such [mining] equipment had only a minor contribution to the total impact, and that while the overall hashrate is expected to increase, the energy consumption and environmental footprint per TH mined is expected to decrease.” </i>
        <i> </i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>According to the report, fossil fuel-reliant China is responsible for 47% of Bitcoin mining’s carbon emissions.</p>
