      <p>Coronation Street’s Andy Whyment reckons Alan Halsall is about to stitch him right up by getting the cast to vote him in for bushtucker trials on I’m a Celebrity.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Alan was heavily rumoured to be heading into the jungle, only for Andy to end up becoming a late addition to the show alongside EastEnders star, Cliff Parisi.</p>
      <p>But now that he is going in, he reckons he could be in trouble – particularly as he’s now at the mercy of his co-stars, who all have the voting app on their phone.</p>
      <p>Speaking ahead of heading into the jungle, Andy said: ‘I know some of my Corrie colleagues and especially Alan Halsall, who plays Tyrone, will vote for me to do the trials.</p>
      <p>‘I know he will be telling everyone to vote for me on Twitter!’</p>

      <p>Well…if he hadn’t thought of it before, he certainly is now!</p>
      <p>Andy and Cliff have been thrown in the deep end with their time on I’m a Celebrity, heading straight into a bushtucker trial to win food stars for their new campmates.</p>

      <p>In a preview clip from tonight’s episode, Andy is seen getting his hands dirty as he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/im-celebrity-latecomer-andy-whyment-rummages-guts-offal-savage-first-bushtucker-trial-11194082/">rifles through mountains of rank smelling offal</a>.</p>
      <p>Seems we’ve got a psychic in our midst, seeing as ‘putting his hands in things’ was literally the first thing he said he didn’t want to do.</p>
      <p>‘I am not looking forward to the eating trials and I am a bit worried about what I will find when you put your hand in something,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘But when you are hungry, you have to do it for your campmates and try your best.’</p>
      <p>We’ve got all our fingers crossed for him – especially considering that if he does badly, he’s got a hungry Ian Wright to deal with…</p>
