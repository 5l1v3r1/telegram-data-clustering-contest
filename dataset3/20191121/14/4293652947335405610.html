      <h1>Pospisil gives Canada lead in Davis Cup quarterfinal against Australia</h1>

      <p>MADRID — Vasek Pospisil has recorded his third major upset for Canada at the Davis Cup Finals, giving his country an early lead in its quarterfinal on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, from Vancouver, beat Australia’s John Millman 7-6 (7), 6-4 in the opening match of the best-of-three tie.</p>
      <p>Ranked 150th in the world after missing the first half of the year following back surgery, Pospisil has beaten No. 12 Fabio Fognini of Italy, No. 36 Reilly Opelka of the United States and No. 48 Millman this week.</p>
      <p>Denis Shapovalov of Richmond Hill, Ont., ranked 15th in the world, was scheduled to face No. 18 Alex de Minaur of Australia in the second singles match.</p>
      <p>A doubles match would decide the tie if de Minaur prevails.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, 29, fought off two set points in the opening tiebreak before taking it. He is now 4-0 in tiebreaks this week.</p>
      <p>The Canadian broke Millman in the final game to win the match.</p>
      <p>Pospisil won 85 per cent of his points when he got his first serve in and had the 15-1 edge in aces.</p>
      <p>Pospisil was a late addition to Canada’s starting lineup for its opening tie against Italy with Felix Auger-Aliassime making his way back from an ankle injury.</p>
      <p>While Canada has said Auger-Aliassime could play, team captain Frank Dancevic elected to ride the hot hand in Pospisil against Australia.</p>
      <p>The Aussies elected to rest No. 30 Nick Kyrgios.</p>
      <p>A former world No. 4 in doubles and No. 25 in singles, Pospisil beat then-No. 9 Karen Khachanov at the U.S. Open this year and reached the round of 16 at the Shanghai Masters. Pospisil, from Vancouver, also won two lower-level Challenger tournaments this fall.</p>
      <p>Milos Raonic, the world No. 31 from Thornhill, Ont., did not make the trip due to a back injury.</p>
      <p>The Davis Cup was first played in 1900 and Canada made its first appearance in 1913. Canada reached the World Group semifinals in 2013.</p>
      <p>The competition is using a new format this year with the six group winners and the next two best teams advancing to the quarterfinals. The final is set for Sunday.</p>
      <p>The four semifinalists secure spots in the 2020 Davis Cup Finals. The rest of the teams in the 2019 Finals have to play qualifying ties next year.</p>
