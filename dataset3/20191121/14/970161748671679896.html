      <p>New <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> paid tribute to the work done by predecessor <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> at his first press conference since replacing the Argentine at Spurs.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach was announced as Tottenham’s new head coach on Wednesday morning, with Pochettino sacked just five months on from the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> final following a poor run of results.</p>
      <p>But the 47-year-old achieved a huge amount during his five-and-a-half years in north London, turning the side into title challengers and recording their highest ever points total in the Premier League.</p>

      <p>Mourinho was keen to praise the work done by Pochettino at Spurs and says he is welcome back to the club any time he likes – while he doesn’t expect him to be out of work for long.</p>

      <p>‘I’ve been smiling for two days. First of all, and I do it with a bit of sadness, I have to speak about Mauricio,’ said Mourinho at his first press conference on Thursday.</p>
      <p>‘I have to congratulate him for the work that he did. I have to share with you what we already shared indoors which is that this club will always be his home, this training ground will always be his training ground.</p>
      <p>‘He can come when he wants, when he misses the players, when he misses the players that he worked with. The door is always open for him.</p>
      <p>‘From my experience, tomorrow is another day. He will find happiness again. He will find a great club again, and he will have a great future.</p>
      <p>‘He gave everything, every day at the club and he will leave with a sad feeling, but a feeling that he did great work.</p>
      <p>‘So I would just like to say that because it it is what everyone at the club feels about it also. He will always be welcome here.’</p>
      <p>Mourinho will only have a few days to prepare for Saturday’s clash with West Ham, but believes Pochettino’s work has left him with a squad capable of competing from the off.</p>

      <p>Asked about his decision to take the job, he continued: ‘I thought about it during these months because I thought I might get a job mid-season and I might have a game two days later.</p>
      <p>‘We have our own ways but they were in the hands of a good manager and coaching staff here.</p>

      <p>‘I’m not going to make the same mistakes. I’m going to make new mistakes. I’m going to be stronger.</p>
      <p>‘From an emotional point of view I’m relaxed, motivated and ready and I think the players felt that these two days. I’m ready and I’m here to support them. In life you go through periods like this, where it’s not about myself, it’s about my players and my club.’</p>
