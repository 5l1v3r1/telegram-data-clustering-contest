      <p>Nintendo sold 6 million copies of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/11/13/20961309/pokemon-sword-and-pokemon-shield-review-nintendo-switch-nov-15-release-date"><i>Pokémon Sword </i>and<i> Shield</i></a>, the company announced Thursday morning. It’s a number that’s broken Nintendo sales records, meaning <i>Sword</i> and <i>Shield </i>are “among the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch games of all time.” In the U.S., more than 2 million copies were sold “in the first two days” after its launch.</p>
      <p>It’s the “highest-grossing launch of any Pokémon game,” Nintendo said.</p>
      <p><i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> were released for Nintendo Switch on Nov. 15 after a tumultuous lead-up — game information started to leak in early November, first with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/11/1/20944379/pokemon-sword-and-shield-leaks-sobble-grookey">evolutions</a> for starters Grookey, Sobble, and Scorbunny, and then <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20947933/pokemon-sword-shield-full-pokedex-cut-pokemon-nintendo-switch-game-freak">the full Pokédex</a>.</p>
      <p>Ahead of <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>’s release, a hashtag started to trend in America: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/14/20963616/pokemon-sword-shield-game-freak-lied-hashtag-nintendo-switch">#GameFreakLied</a>. Pokémon fans upset about what they saw in the leaks — which evolved into full-on gameplay videos — said they’d boycott the games. Furor over a culled Pokédex continued to overwhelm the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/13/18677717/pokemon-sword-shield-national-dex-pokedex-galar-e3-2019">pre-release narrative</a> of <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i>.</p>
      <p>Despite controversy, <i>Sword </i>and <i>Shield</i> made an impression with Pokémon fans <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/18/20966699/pokemon-sword-shield-animations-graphics-nintendo-switch-camping">as clips continue to go viral</a> across the internet. The sales numbers tell a similar story.</p>
