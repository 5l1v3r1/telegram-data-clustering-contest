      <p>Health bosses have apologised to the family of a pensioner who died in the care of staff who ‘didn’t recognise the importance of hydration’.</p>
      <p>Staff at Walsall Manor Hospital failed to fill in food charts for Malcom Pinches, 80, meaning it wasn’t known whether he had eaten, an investigation found.</p>
      <p>His daughter Tina Noon says he was left at the West Midlands facility without any dignity and claims she was forced to feed him herself on on occasion.</p>
      <p>Mr Pinches, from Pelsall, East Midlands, was placed in a side room on his own despite having suffered a fall and cutting his head during his stay at the facility.</p>
      <p>His daughter believes nurses wanted to get him out of hospital and says her dad was placed in discharge wards when he was clearly not well enough to go home.</p>

      <p>There was also confusion about whether or not the pensioner had suffered a mini-stroke before arriving at hospital on May 27 this year.</p>

      <p>Mrs Noon said the GP who responded to a 111 call believed he had a mini-stroke by doctors said there was no mention of this in Mr Pinches medical notes.</p>
      <p>The retired engineer’s condition deteriorated before his death on June 13.</p>
      <p>An investigation by the Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, found ‘inconsistency of documenting food diary input and output as one of the failings in Mr Pinches’ care.</p>
      <p>They also blamed ‘not recognising when an individual requires more help with their meals’ and ‘not recognising the importance of hydration’ and vowed to make improvements.</p>
      <p>Addressing Mrs Noon, the trust’s chief executive Richard Beeken said he was ‘very sorry you had to feed your father and encourage him to drink because you felt nursing staff were uncaring and not doing their job properly’.</p>

      <p>While in hospital Mr Pinches had been on a drip but his cannula came out.</p>
      <p>Mr Beeken said: ‘This does not portray a good example of the expected standard of care to be delivered by our staff.’</p>
      <p>But an apology wasn’t enough for Mrs Noon, 57, who said the ‘dignity that was lost was beyond belief’.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘He was being passed from discharge ward to discharge ward when he was getting progressively worse.</p>
      <p>‘What the hell was going on? They were just trying to get him out.</p>

      <p>‘The apology means diddly squat. Don’t be really sorry, change things’.</p>
      <p>Mr Pinches fixed engines at Lucas Aerospace in Wolverhampton and was also a keen member of Wolverhampton Slot Car Club.</p>
      <p>Director of nursing at the trust Karen Dunderdale said: ‘We have thoroughly investigated the complaint that was made and have apologised for our care falling below the standard we would expect in some areas.</p>
      <p>‘We continually work with our patients and their families to ensure improvements are made to help us deliver safe, high-quality care and have offered to meet with Mr Pinches’ family which has been accepted in order to further address their concerns.’</p>
