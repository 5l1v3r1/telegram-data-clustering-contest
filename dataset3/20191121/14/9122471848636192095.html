      <h1>ESPN Predicts If The CFB Playoff Will Take Alabama Or Oregon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:18:42+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>The first three College Football Playoff spots aren’t completely locked up yet, but Clemson, LSU and Ohio State are all on track to get in. It’s the No. 4 spot where there’s a legitimate question mark.</p>
      <p>Several teams, from Georgia to Oregon to Utah to Alabama, will potentially have a claim for that fourth and final spot in this year’s College Football Playoff.</p>
      <p>Who’s going to get it?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/page/gamedaykickoff191121/college-football-playoff-committee-biggest-debates-alabama-oregon-others">ESPN has predicted</a> if the College Football Playoff selection committee would take an 11-1 Alabama team or a 12-1 Oregon team.</p>
      <p>The prediction: Oregon.</p>
      <blockquote><b>Early prediction:</b> Oregon.<br/><b>Here’s why:</b> There is written protocol to be followed, and Oregon would likely win the tiebreakers, which include strength of schedule and conference championship games.</blockquote>
      <p>Alabama likely needs to dominate – and I mean <i>dominate </i>– Auburn next week in order to have a real chance at making it in. If the Crimson Tide win in close or sloppy fashion, they’re probably out. If they win in a blowout, though, it could get interesting.</p>
