      <h1>Royal Navy signs deal for increased collaboration as China stakes claims</h1>
      <h2>HMS Queen Elizabeth first operational deployment will be conducting freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea region in 2021</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:32:48+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Max Channon</a></address>
      <p>The Royal Navy has signed a tri-lateral agreement reaffirming its  commitment to increased collaboration and cooperation with the US and Japan.</p>
      <p>The deal was agreed onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth, whose first operational deployment will be a 2021 mission in the Pacific,  amid concerns regarding freedom of navigation in the region. </p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the US stepped up its freedom of navigation operations in the disputed South China Sea region of the East Pacific, in a bid to halt China's attempts to strengthen its maritime claims in the area.</p>
      <p>Back in 2018, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson  told Australian ministers that HMS Queen Elizabeth would conduct freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea region on her maiden deployment in 2021.</p>
      <p>Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said at the time: “We spoke about the challenges including in the South China Sea and we had a long discussion about the Pacific and the opportunities for deeper British engagement in our part of the world.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: "One of the first things we will do with the two new colossal aircraft carriers that we have just built is send them on a freedom of navigation operation to this area, to vindicate our belief in the rules-based international system and in the freedom of navigation through those waterways which are absolutely vital for world trade.”</p>

      <p>Yesterday, First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin met US Navy Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Mike Gilday and Chief of Staff of the Japan Maritime Self-Defence Force Adm. Hiroshi Yamamura, for a trilateral maritime discussion onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth.</p>
      <p>The three leaders signed a  trilateral cooperation agreement reaffirming their commitment to increased collaboration and cooperation. While the deal does not mention China by name , it "encourages others to responsibly take their place on the world stage in co-operation with regional countries".</p>
      <p>Adm. Mike Gilday said: "Today, we reaffirm our commitment to strengthen our common efforts, which demonstrates that our relationships are institutional, rather than merely personal.</p>
      <p>“This agreement strengthens our naval bonds and codifies our continued dedication to a free and open maritime commons. There is much to celebrate in our trilateral relationship; indeed the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”</p>
      <p>"Ensuring access to waterways – and the economic prosperity that flows with it – requires a continued commitment to international norms and the law of the sea.</p>

      <p>"Being ready to defend these norms is important to us all. This is why we all continue to fly, sail, and operate wherever international law allows.”</p>
      <p>Adm Gilday said that operating together with Allies like the United Kingdom and Japan, who have global reputations for conducting the most complex and demanding naval operations, is critical to security.</p>
      <p>Adm Yamamura said: "We should adapt ourselves to a newly emerging security trend. With this trilateral heads of navy meeting as a catapult, I am confident we'll work together to find our way ahead.”</p>
      <p>Adm Radkin said: "In an increasingly interconnected world, partnerships and alliances such as this are vital for protecting the freedoms of the international community.</p>
      <p>"I look forward to continuing to learn from one another, sharing our experiences and exploring where we can pursue our common aims together.”</p>
