      <h1>Sword and Shield fans spot unique effect for certain Shiny Pokémon</h1>
      <h2>Unova thing to collect.</h2>

      <p>Pokémon Sword and Shield contains a new appearance effect for certain Shiny Pokémon, fans have discovered.</p>
      <p>This phenomenon has lead some fans to dub the discovery as a new, even rarer tier of alternate-coloured monsters. But this may not be entirely true.</p>
      <p>Shiny Pokémon are meant to be extremely rare in mainline Pokémon games. The odds of finding one are usually around 1/4000, and they offer no advantage other than having an alternate colour scheme. (Pokémon Go makes them considerably easier to find.)</p>
      <p>But for collectors, the pursuit of Shiny Pokémon has long been an obsession. Pokéfans have spent hours restarting their games over and over until they get a Shiny version of their starter Pokémon, or employing one of the series' various mechanics to raise their chances of finding a Shiny by a fraction of a degree.</p>
      <p>When one does arrive - its alternate colour scheme visible, and with an effect like a flash of stars to make sure you notice - it is a big deal.</p>
      <p>So it's an even bigger deal that Pokémon Sword and Shield has certain Shiny Pokémon which boast an alternate effect. Instead of a flash of stars, they arrive with what looks like a flash of squares, or diamonds.</p>

      <p>This comparison image comes from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSwordAndShield/comments/dz2yq4/galar_has_brought_us_a_surprise_for_the_most/">Reddit</a>:</p>

      <p>Today, we're starting to get an idea of why this happens. Peering into each games' code, Pokémon trainer <a href="https://twitter.com/Kaphotics/status/1197027047224176640">Kurt</a> claims to have found evidence that the likelihood of a Shiny with the square effect is 1/16th that of the base Shiny rarity.</p>
      <p>This is determined, as ever, by each game profile's unique Trainer ID code, and whether it matches the number string of the unique Pokémon ID code in question. A shiny with the square effect requires an even "cleaner" match of these numbers, Kurt says.</p>

      <p>But there's something else going on, too. A follow-up tweet suggests getting a Shiny Pokémon using chaining (a recently-added method which increases Shiny chances) actually pushes the chances of getting the supposedly rarer square effect much higher - making it unclear how much rarer it actually is. Kurt has said more research is now needed.</p>
      <p>What is clear is that there are now two appearance effects for Shiny Pokémon in Sword and Shield. And for trainers who do want to catch 'em all - well, the job just became even harder.</p>
