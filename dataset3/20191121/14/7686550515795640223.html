      <p>Plans to turn a former bank into a chip shop have been withdrawn.</p>
      <p>There had been several objections to the application to turn the former NatWest bank on the roundabout at Park Road, Whitchurch, into a takeaway.</p>
      <p>The day before it was just to be heard at planning, the applicant withdrew the proposal. It had been put down to be refused.</p>
      <p>Local Conservative councillor Mike Phillips said: "We are pleased that officers, in recommending the application be refused, they recognised the residential nature of this area.</p>
      <p>"This means it should continue to be protected from the smell, noise and general disturbance associated with these type of outlets. We would expect any further applications to be assessed to these same standards."</p>
      <p>The bank has been closed since May 2018, and the building and been empty since then.</p>
      <p>Plans to turn it into a chip shop with three apartments above were recommended to be refused at Cardiff council planning this week.</p>
      <p>It said: "The premises are located in a primarily residential area outside a local centre and the proposed use is considered likely to result in nuisance and loss of amenity to adjoining and nearby residents by virtue of smell, noise and general disturbance, particularly during the evenings."</p>
      <p>Local resident Alison Morris said: "There's already a problem with parking around this roundabout and the nearby streets.</p>
      <p>"Having somewhere that people will just pop into for five minutes will just add to the problems that are already there. It is such a shame that they closed the bank in the first place as it was well used and important for the local community."</p>
      <p>Another said: "There are already two established chip shops in the area. There is no room for another one. It will just attract crowds in the evening and cause even more rubbish."</p>
