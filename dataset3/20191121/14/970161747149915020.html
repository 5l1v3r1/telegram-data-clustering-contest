      <p>And it looks as though the family had the best of times as they explored the capital’s festive theme park.</p>
      <p>Taking to Instagram, the proud mum uploaded a cute snap of her bambinos looking up at the Christmas lights.</p>
      <p>The trio could be seen all wrapped up and ready for the winter chill in their bobble hats and gloves.</p>

      <p>The park was opened to a number of stars on Wednesday evening, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/gemma-collins-holly-willoughby-bask-festive-season-grand-opening-winter-wonderland-11191873/">where Holly was joined by the likes of Gemma Collins and Amber Gill.</a></p>
      <p>Gem looked all prepared for the holiday season as she opted for a bright red scarf and matching beret.</p>
      <p>And it seems the Towie star had a blast, as she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/gemma-collins-living-best-life-bumper-cars-winter-wonderland-just-pure-11193973/">spotted having all the fun behind the wheel on the bumper cars.</a></p>
      <p>Taking her nephew along for the ride, the 38-year-old couldn’t wipe the smile off her face as she whizzed around the track.</p>
      <p>But it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Gemma is an expert when it comes to driving, after all, she did use to be a car salesperson before finding fame on reality TV.</p>
      <p>She also recently swapped her £70,000 BMW for a 1999 Nissan Micra with a market value of just £275.</p>
