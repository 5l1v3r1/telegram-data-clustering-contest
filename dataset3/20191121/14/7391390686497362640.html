      <p>There may still be a few weeks left in the season, but <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/all-the-clues-ashley-ben-are-dating-after-temptation-island-19345778"><i>Temptation Island's</i> Ashley H.</a> is already taking full advantage of her new platform. Not only has she accrued a large social media following, she's now running a YouTube channel and launching her own swimsuit line, among other things. Basically, she's become a full-on, full-time influencer.</p>
      <p>This is pretty common for reality stars, which is why your favorite <i>Bachelor </i>contestants end up selling you detox tea on Instagram. But instead of starting a podcast, Ashley is building a brand (and no, not just a personal one). She's currently promoting her swim line, <a href="https://www.alineswim.com/products">A.line Swim</a>, which features four bikini styles. And according to the official website, the line was <a href="https://www.alineswim.com/about-us">inspired by Ashley's <i>Temptation Island </i>experience.</a></p>
      <p>"After I was on a television show I realized that I can do MORE," it reads. "I would have a hard time finding clothes that would fit me, let alone bikinis. Thats why I decided to create my own brand that would be comfortable and help women feel confident, beautiful, and happy in their own skin. I worked at this swim line for about 6 months and just launched the first swimsuit [in] October 2019. I hope my company grows as much as I have. I didn't think it was a real dream, but now that dream is coming true and that is to be my own BOSS."</p>
      <p>Ashley Howland on YouTube</p>
      <p>To further pursue that dream, Ashley started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwRX5CiVISc0I3LW0EWPLNQ">her YouTube channel</a>, where she uploads workouts, vlogs, fashion content, and more. She revealed in a Q&amp;A video that<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzCZXU-VkBw"> she's now living in Los Angeles</a> — notably <i>not </i>Florida, where she was living with Casey. But what's juiciest is her recent series reacting to the remaining episodes of <i>Temptation Island </i>Season 2.</p>
      <p>In one video, she<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng0eKqFAoUs"> reacted to her first kiss with Ben</a>, and then to her boyfriend Casey seeing them in bed together. Sitting in between her two friends on her couch with a glass of wine in hand, she may have even let a spoiler slip: "We weren't having sex that time," she said.</p>
      <p>Naturally, Ashley hasn't revealed the fate of her and Casey's relationship, but her reactions to his presence onscreen were far from positive — and her friends didn't hold back, either. They were basically roasting him the whole time. Whatever happens in the rest of Ashley's <i>Temptation Island </i>journey, it definitely seems like she's <i>not </i>with Casey. Maybe her future YouTube videos will reveal more.</p>
