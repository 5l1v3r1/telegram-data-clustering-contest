      <h2>EXCLUSIVE: The all-star ensemble of glossy new musical film CATS discuss the new film in a brand new teaser trailer with the Industry Trust</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:31:11+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>A new trailer for the CATS movie has been released.</p>
      <p>The "Moments Worth Paying For" clip features members of the all-star ensemble cast from director <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tom-hooper">Tom Hooper</a> in his Universal Pictures International adaptation of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/andrew-lloyd-webber">Andrew Lloyd Webber</a> musical CATS, which itself was adapted from Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats by T.S. Eliot.</p>
      <p>"This is a moment for you to step into a world that is completely designed to entertain you," teases <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/idris-elba">Idris Elba.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/james-corden">James Corden</a> says "There is nothing else like it", while pop star <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/taylor-swift">Taylor Swift</a> explains that "The music is so timeless."</p>
      <p>The visually-driven musical event has already created <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/film/cats-movie-releases-new-trailer-20916142">quite the reaction on social medi</a>a, meaning it will likely cause a big stir upon its release.</p>

      <p>Scenes in the clip include some very dynamic dance sequences, a look at the unique characters, and some cats dancing around Trafalgar Square - more could you want?</p>
      <p>The film also stars <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jennifer-hudson">Jennifer Hudson</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jason-derulo">Jason Derulo</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/judi-dench">Dame Judi Dench</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/ian-mckellen">Sir Ian McKellen</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rebel-wilson">Rebel Wilson</a>, and newcomer Francesca Hayward.</p>
      <p>The official synopsis for the film reads: "Over the course of a single night, a tribe of cats called the Jellicles make what is known as "the Jellicle choice" and decide which cat will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life."</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, it will certainly be getting a lot of attention come December!</p>
