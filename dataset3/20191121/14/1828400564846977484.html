      <h2>A number of roads are closed in Lytham this afternoon due to a chimney fire in Park View Road.</h2>

      <p>Fire crews were called to a home near Lytham Church of England Primary School at 12.35pm, after a log-burning stove caused a chimney to set on fire.</p>
      <p>Two engines from Blackpool and St Annes responded and firefighters have contained the fire.</p>
      <p>Due to the road being narrow, Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service have asked police to close a stretch of Park View Road.</p>
      <p>A police spokesman said: "Due to a fire on Park View Road, Lytham, closures are in place on Ballam Road at the junction with Park View Road and Mythop Road at the junction with Park View Road.</p>
      <p>"It is estimated the road will be closed for the next hour and a half."</p>
