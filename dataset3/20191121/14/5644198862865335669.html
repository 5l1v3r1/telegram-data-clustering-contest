      <p>PUTRAJAYA: Almost 700 people were arrested in Malaysia when authorities raided a building and busted the largest online scam syndicate believed to be run by Chinese nationals in the country.</p>
      <p>Some suspects attacked security officials while others fled as a huge team from the immigration department launched a dramatic early morning raid on Wednesday (Nov 20) on the sixth-storey premises in Cyberjaya, south of the capital Kuala Lumpur.</p>

      <p>Photos from Wednesday's raid showed people standing behind rows of desks mounted with computers, hands held behind their heads, while others sat huddled together on the floor.</p>
      <p>Videos circulating online purportedly showed dozens of people scattering and fleeing from the premises. One man was seen being detained and tackled to the ground.</p>

        <b>VICTIMS IN CHINA TARGETED</b>
      </p>
      <p>Officials seized more than 8,000 phones and almost 1,000 computers used to run the scam, which targeted victims in China by offering fast profits in return for investments.</p>
      <p>Those captured - 603 men and 77 women - had entered Malaysia on a social visit pass intended for tourists or visiting friends, but not for work, said immigration chief Khairul Dzaimee Daud.</p>
      <p>About 100 to 120 suspects managed to escape from the building, and officials said they are trying to track them down.</p>
      <p>Acting on a public tip-off, he said officials conducted surveillance on the building for almost a month before the raid.</p>
      <p>The syndicate is believed to have been operating for the last six months. The office that was raided was rented at RM360,000 (US$86,000) a month, said immigration officials. </p>
      <p>The suspects will be remanded for 14 days. They are expected to face charges including violating social visit pass regulations, entering and residing in Malaysia without a valid visa and overstaying.</p>
      <p>The Chinese embassy has been informed of the arrests, officials said. </p>
