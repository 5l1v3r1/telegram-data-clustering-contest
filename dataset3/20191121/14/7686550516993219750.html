      <h2>Health experts say more people taking up the vaccine option will pay dividends in the long run</h2>

      <p>It may start with a sniffle and then you think ‘here we go’.</p>
      <p>Is that cold on its way, or, even worse, is flu about to make its unwelcome presence felt?</p>
      <p>Well, now with the spectre of winter upon us, what do you expect? You are probably going to get something - the question is what?</p>
      <p>There is a lot of confusion about what people may succumb to over the long months ahead.</p>
      <p>Why, it could even be ‘man flu’, that strain which can afflict members of the male species who normally still manage, despite their condition, to tell anyone who is prepared to listen all about it.</p>
      <p>Dr Jo Longstaffe is a director at Wales’ first private general practice, known as the Independent General Practice. Clinics are held at HMT Sancta Maria Hospital in Swansea.</p>
      <p>Here, she dispels some myths about flu and the flu vaccine and offers some helpful advice on avoiding catching flu this winter.</p>
      <h3>Give yourself the best chance of avoiding flu</h3>

      <p>“At this time of year I see many patients with a similar set of symptoms with varying degrees of severity," she said. "While some people pick up colds and upper respiratory infections that can cause coughs and runny noses, others will have a more serious set of symptoms that are more associated with the flu virus.</p>
      <p>"Flu can cause a high fever and body aches, severe fatigue and coughing for up to two weeks or more. In some cases it can be fatal and so I encourage my patients to do everything they can to avoid catching flu, especially at this time of year."</p>
      <p>One of the best ways to avoid flu is to have the flu vaccine. While it is offered to high risk groups, including older people and young children on the NHS, vaccine is available to others through the Independent GP Practice at Sancta Maria Hospital. Even if you feel that you are fit and healthy, you may be helping the spread of flu to other, more vulnerable people around you if you do not have the flu jab.</p>
      <p>"There are some common misconceptions about the flu jab that I hear frequently," said Dr Longstaffe. "Many people are concerned that the vaccine will give them the flu or cause other nasty side effects. In fact, the flu viruses contained within the vaccine are either weakened or have been killed and are therefore inactive.</p>
      <p>"It takes around two weeks to kick in, so there is a possibility of picking up the flu virus within that time but it’s not caused by the jab. For most people, there will be no side effects from the vaccine but others will feel weak for a day or two with fever and muscle pain but it’s a lot less severe than flu. I recommend getting the flu vaccine every year if you want to give yourself the best chance of avoiding the virus."</p>
      <h3>Common sense measures will help pay dividends</h3>

      <p>"As well as the jab, you can give yourself the best chance of avoiding the flu if you wash your hands regularly and keep surfaces that come in contact with people clean," said Dr Longstaffe. "Other immune system boosting lifestyle factors such as a balanced diet, getting enough sleep and exercising frequently will also help to ward off the virus.</p>
      <p>"If you are unfortunate enough to have flu this winter then rest as much as you can. Keep warm and drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Take paracetamol or ibuprofen for aches, pains and fever."</p>
