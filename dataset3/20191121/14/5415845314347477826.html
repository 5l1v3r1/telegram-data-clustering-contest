      <h1>Arsenal: Managerial bogies taking care of themselves</h1>
      <h2>Arsenal fans are ready for a new manager, but all the “favorites” are being scooped up. Fine by me, clear out the bogies and let the good ones alone.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:00:53+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://paininthearsenal.com/author/joshsippie/" target="_blank">Josh Sippie</a></address>
      <p>The #EmeryOut brigade is going just as strong as the now-repentent #WengerOut brigade used to be, and yet again, we see that <a href="https://paininthearsenal.com/category/arsenal-news/">Arsenal</a> fans have very short leashes when it comes to expecting results immediately. It doesn’t matter the circumstance. Results or GTFO.</p>
      <p>Two of the leading candidates that fans were hoping to replace Unai Emery were <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/b9407435/Luis-Enrique?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Luis Enrique</a> and Jose Mourinho. The former I understand, the latter I never will. Within weeks of the rumors kicking up, both managers have been snatched up.</p>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur, the gift that keeps on giving, have snatched up Mourinho in an act that has me so incredibly excited to see them fail. Even more than before.</p>
      <p>And the Spanish international team has snatched up Luis Enrique, thus barring Arsenal from becoming Barcelona 2.0. Or 0.5, depending on who you ask.</p>
      <p>This is all perfectly fine and not worth complaining about. You didn’t <i>really</i> want Jose Mourinho, you just liked the idea of a new manager who has won things. Same goes with Luis Enrique. Having won things doesn’t always make you a good fit. Point in case: Unai Emery has won things.</p>
      <p>And for what it’s worth, there was a lot of belief in Unai Emery when he was first appointed because of numerous factors, and when the time comes to replace him, I expect the same level of dedication the club put in to choosing him. That means not making a snap judgment and nabbing Mourinho, when everyone actually knows it’s a terrible idea. (Really though, how could you like it?)</p>
      <p>There are good options out there. Max Allegri, for instance, would be a dream. Personally, I love the idea of <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/6d3e0d09/Antonio-Conte?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Antonio Conte</a>. And <a href="https://fbref.com/en/players/d934d1e6/Mikel-Arteta?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-">Mikel Arteta</a> isn’t awful either. But there needs to be due diligence unless you want to leap on to the managerial carousel which, trust me, you don’t. It’s awful.</p>
      <p>This reminds me of when fans were desperate to get Carlo Ancelotti in place of Arsene Wenger, thinking he was the answer to push us over the edge. Again, snap decisions going after flash-in-the-pan managers are not the Arsenal way. This is <i>your</i> club too, so get on board with it. We want someone to build and progress, not be a Mourinho.</p>
