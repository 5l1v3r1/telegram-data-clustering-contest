      <p><b>Nir Eyal</b> started his career by helping technology designers develop products that are intentionally habit-forming. Now he’s working to help ordinary people understand the forces that distract and misdirect them. Eyal’s first book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788">Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products</a>,” and his newest title, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Indistractable-Control-Your-Attention-Choose/dp/194883653X">Indistractable: How to Control Your Attention and Choose Your Life</a>,” both involve cultivating an understanding of how our minds direct our behavior and form activity patterns over time.</p>
      <p>Eyal shares specific, actionable techniques for making “indistractability” a habit — by prioritizing the right activities, staying focused on completing goals, and staying accountable and motivated over time.</p>
