      <h1>Maoist link: Govt. opposes bail plea of two students</h1>
      <h2>State Attorney says the probe is only at its preliminary stage</h2>

      <p>Opposing the bail petitions filed by two students arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for allegedly distributing pro-Maoist pamphlets in Kozhikode, the State government on Thursday submitted before the High Court that they have connections with the absconding third accused Usman who is allegedly having strong Maoists links.</p>
      <p>When the bail petition filed by Alan Suhaib and Taha Fazal was taken up for hearing, State Attorney K.V. Sohan submitted that Usman was involved in more than 10 criminal cases. Of these, five cases had been registered under the provisions of UAPA.</p>
      <p>He further submitted that the two students were seen to have used code languages in documents seized by the police. The police were yet to decode the pen drive and laptop recovered from the two. He said the investigation was only at its preliminary stage. Therefore, they should not be granted bail.</p>
      <p>According to the petitioners, there was no material to show that they owed allegiance to any Maoist organisation. Besides, in the Shyam Balakrishnan's case, the High Court had already observed that being Maoists was not a crime, though the political ideology of the Maoist would not synchronise with our constitutional polity.</p>
      <p>The court reserved its order on the petition.</p>
