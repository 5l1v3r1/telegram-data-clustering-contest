      <p>It was youngster Rocco's first start for the under-15s.</p>
      <p><i>SunSport</i> exclusively <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/4969349/celtic-rudi-vata-son-debut-republic-of-ireland/">revealed on Tuesday night that Rocco was set to make his debut</a>.</p>
      <p>And he did as he helped his country to two wins in two games at Eamonn Deacy Park.</p>
      <p>Jason Donohue's team had previously beaten the same opponent on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Kevin Zefi netted his second in successive games after number ten Rocco Vata had opened the scoring for Ireland.</p>
      <p>Vata Snr would have been proud of his son and the rest of the boys as they came from behind to win.</p>
      <p>Poland pounced from a corner kick on six minutes and opened the scoring.</p>
      <p>However, towards the end of the first half, Ireland missed a penalty but Rocco was on hand to tap into the net on the rebound to level proceedings.</p>
      <p>Then on 64 minutes the Irish completed the comeback when Zefi found himself in the right place to fire in from around 22 yards out.</p>
      <p>Dad and former Celtic hero Vata won 59 caps for Albania and lifted the Scottish Cup with the Hoops in 1995.</p>
      <p>Rocco 14 is in the Hoops academy. He also qualifies for Albania, Scotland and Montenegro.</p>
      <p>He can represent the Irish through his Dublin-born gran Ann on his mother’s side.</p>
      <p>Vata, 50, now an agent and TV pundit, said: “When I joined Celtic, I met my new team-mates for the first time in Dublin.</p>
      <p>“My debut was against Sligo Rovers because we were on a pre-season tour.</p>
      <p>“This is part of my history so it is special for my son to be in Ireland now.</p>
      <p>“Nobody in the Albanian FA contacted me about Rocco. I know that Scotland have watched him too, but the Irish association was the first to get in contact.</p>
      <p>“His granny is the happiest Irish woman in Scotland!"</p>
