      <p>National Chairman of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Samuel Ofosu Ampofo has revealed that it is not within his purview to determine who becomes running mate to the party’s flagbearer John Dramani Mahama for the 2020 polls.</p>
      <p>He is however optimistic that the party will announce a suitable partner for the former President next year ahead of the polls in December but fell short to give hints as to who partners him.</p>
      <p>“I am not the one who chooses the running mate. I am a kingmaker so I hardly hear anything as far as choosing a person as the running mate is concerned,” he revealed on Accra-based Asempa Fm adding “‘We don’t choose  running mates outside election years; they are always chosen during the election year so we will announce ours in 2020. I don’t see us lagging behind”</p>
      <p>Many names have come up as possible candidates for the position with various reasons assigned as to who is the most favorite to ensure that the National Democratic Congress (NDC) is able to defeat the current New Patriotic Party (NPP) in 2020.</p>
      <p>A deep-throat in the NDC told <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> some names that have tentatively come up for consideration for running mate include, in no particular order, Marrietta Appiah-Opong Brew, a former Attorney-General, Kwesi Ahwoi, Ghana’s former Agric Minister and High Commissioner to South Africa, Dr Johnson Asiama, a former Bank of Ghana Deputy Governor; Mr Julius Debrah, a former Minister and the immediate-past Chief of Staff and Hannah S. Tetteh, a former Foreign Minister now U.N top Diplomat, Prof Jane Naana Opoku Agyemang, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast and Education Minister under the John Mahama administration.</p>
      <p>Others include Dr Kwesi Botchwey who was Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission under Mahama and Dr. Zanetor Rawlings, MP and daughter of the Rawlingses.</p>
      <p>But Former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (GNPC), Mr. Alex Mould recently outlined the characteristics of who makes a good running mate, he saying “I think anybody who is going to assist John Mahama and the NDC needs to have strong leadership qualities, needs to have a strong grasp of the economy”, he revealed.</p>
      <p>Put on the spot to comment if he will accept the position of a running mate in the NDC he said the time was not ripe for him to make such a decision and that if even approached, there was the need for a discussion.</p>
      <p>“I would like to give back and help our leaders in doing what I think I am capable of and I would like to understand what my role is in helping the organization”, he disclosed on the show monitored by MyNewsGh.com</p>
