      <p>His QC, Gordon Jackson, said Mr Salmond was pleading not guilty, and judge Lady Dorrian set the trial date for 9 March next year.</p>

      <p>He added: “The only proper place to answer criminal charges is in this court, and that is exactly what I intend to do next spring.”</p>
      <h3>What is Mr Salmond accused of?</h3>
      <p>The charges are set out in an indictment which includes the specific details of the allegations against the 64-year-old former SNP leader.</p>
      <p>The attempted rape is said to have happened in June 2014 at the first minister’s official Bute House residence in Edinburgh. He is alleged to have pushed a woman against a wall and to have removed her clothes and his own, before pushing her onto a bed and lying naked on top of her.</p>
