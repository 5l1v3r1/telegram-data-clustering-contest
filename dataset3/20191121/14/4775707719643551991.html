      <h3>Borderlands 3 is Free to Play Now on Xbox One</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Heidi+Nicholas">Heidi Nicholas</a>, 21 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Borderlands-3/achievements">Borderlands 3</a> is free to play, from now until November 24th. That's the whole weekend to go ahead and try out the game for free, and get a taste of what it's like before the DLC comes next month. Plus, Gearbox <a href="https://borderlands.com/en-US/news/2019-11-20-moxxi-s-heist-of-the-handsome-jackpot/">say</a> any progress you make will carry over if you then decide to buy the game, so you can jump straight back in where you left off.</p>

      <p>Gearbox picked a good time for this free trial. Attention for the game has been given a big boost by the unveiling of its first campaign DLC: Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot. Moxxi's heist comes out on December 19th, and is included in both the Season Pass and the Super Deluxe Edition of Borderlands 3. They're both pretty pricey options, with the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/borderlands-3-season-pass/bnl36smm5j6n?atc=true&amp;rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Season Pass</a> alone going at $49.99 and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/borderlands-3-deluxe-edition/C4MJQHMNFC98?rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab">Super Deluxe Edition</a> at $79.99, but not to worry; if you've been eyeing up the game for a while, or considering jumping into the Borderlands franchise, this weekend's free trial gives you about four days of trying it out for free, so you can have a go before deciding whether or not to spend.</p>
      <p>The base game offers four Vault Hunters to choose from: gunner Moze, Operative Zane, Siren Amara and Beastmaster FL4K. Aside from the general waves of enemies and loot, the overall story of the game is the mission to take down the Calypso Twins and their entourage of bandit gangs. Gearbox Studio Head Randy Pitchford popped up in the <a href="https://youtu.be/minXu9Kszks">third episode</a> of the Borderlands Show, in which he talked about how important the lore and overall world of Borderlands was to them when designing Borderlands 3. The DLC, Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot, gave them a chance to goof off in the Borderlands world without having to worry about overarching plot and world lore. It's about 7 hours of bizarre content with a classic heist theme. Moxxi's recruiting for her gang, with the aim of infiltrating, looting, and generally taking back Handsome Jack's casino, which is on a cruise ship in space. Moxxi's got a grudge against Jack; they used to be married, and he stole the plans for the casino from her. It's a crazy run through an opulent casino full of new enemies and loot, and can be treated as endgame content or as a lengthy sidequest.</p>
      <p>Borderlands 3 has been out for some time now, and if you've been debating whether or not to pick it up, this free weekend is a pretty good time to find out.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres â€” when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
