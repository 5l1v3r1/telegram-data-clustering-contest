      <h1>More than a dozen migrants found in lorry on France-Ireland ferry</h1>

      <p>Irish authorities have launched an investigation after 16 migrants were found in a lorry container on an overnight ferry travelling from France to Ireland.</p>
      <p>Police said on Thursday that officers were looking into potential breaches of immigration legislation, and carrying out medical and immigration assessments on each person.</p>
      <p>It added that the "articulated truck" in which the migrants were found had been detained, and the driver and owners were assisting with enquiries.</p>
      <p>The migrants were discovered on Thursday morning on the Stena Horizon ship, which left Cherbourg at 9 pm on Wednesday and docked at Rosslare port the following afternoon.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Euronews, a Stena Line spokesperson said an employee had made the discovery in a "sealed trailer" during a routine check of the vehicle deck.</p>
      <p>All the migrants were then taken out of the container and moved to a private lounge area to be looked after by crew for the rest of the journey.</p>
      <p>They were all alive and in "good health", the spokesperson added, although their countries of origin are not yet known.</p>
      <p>"Stena Line has alerted security and immigration officials in Rosslare so as the necessary arrangements can be made for the group on the vessel's arrival in Rosslare," the spokesperson added.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Ireland's Minister for Justice and Equality Charles Flanagan said he was "extremely concerned" and appealed for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>He said: "I was extremely concerned to learn of another incident of people being found in a sealed lorry container, on this occasion onboard a ferry.</p>
      <p>"There is an active Garda investigation underway and I would appeal to anyone with any information on these nefarious activities to come forward. I welcome the statement issued by An Garda Síochána earlier today.</p>
      <p>"The persons found in the lorry container are now being cared for by state services. As part of that care, they will receive initial medical assessments."</p>
      <p>The news comes amid a heightened focus on human trafficking cases across Europe, following the discovery last month of 39 bodies in the back of a refrigerated lorry container in Essex.</p>
      <p>All the victims were Vietnamese nationals and were believed to have travelled across Europe in search of a better life.</p>
