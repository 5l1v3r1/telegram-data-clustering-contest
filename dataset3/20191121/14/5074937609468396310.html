      <h1>Photographers cash in at Kaaf University congregation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:00:51+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Laudia Sawer, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Gomoa Fetteh Kakraba (CR), Nov 20, GNA – The art of professional photographers invading public event whether invited or uninvited attracted public attention at the Kaaf University College as 548 Students graduated.</p>
      <p>The photographers, some of whom said they came to the campus of Kaaf at Gomoa Fetteh Kakraba in the Central Region from the Eastern and Greater Accra Regions used acrobatic antics to attract attention whilst some few run over each other to get both students, faculty, and guests to capture the historic academic moment.</p>
      <p>The Ghana News Agency observed that  in spite of the usage of personal mobile phones to take pictures which had gained currency in the public domain, the traditional photographers also devised modern means to fast track the printing of the pictures .</p>
      <p>The Photographers set-up temporal structures, which also served as studios, with some having studio chairs, laminating machines, printers and other equipment, to aid the work of the getting the client quick picture.</p>
      <p>Even though one A4 size laminated photograph attracted GH¢10.00, the shutter of the cameras of the photographers did not rest for hours as hundreds of people used the occasion to snap lots of photographs.</p>
      <p>The GNA also noticed that in their quest to make more money and outsmart each other, some of their equipment broke down in the middle of either printing or laminating pictures, a situation that caused frustration among their patrons who complained about the delay in getting their pictures.</p>
      <p>Photo enthusiasts could not control themselves from posing to the cameras in the makeshift studios, beside cars, on the streets and any available space on campus so long as a photographer was available or their mobile phones could give a click.</p>
      <p>Mr Kingsley Kwadwo Appiah, the only graduate, who obtained first class honours in BSC. Construction Technology told the GNA that for him, taking plenty photos was the only way to preserve the historic academic graduation memory.</p>
      <p>Mr Appiah added that he took over 30 pictures amounting to over GH¢300.00 without counting cost as he was excited at his achievement adding that he also snapped a lot with his phone.</p>
      <p>He said “this day will never come again and I need to preserve this memory for the future” adding that “in fact some of the photographers took the pictures without my permission, but when they showed it to me on the camera, I asked them to print because they were lovely”.</p>
      <p>According to him, as part of the package, he got soft copies of the pictures from them which he used for his whatsapp status for his friends and relative to know that he had successfully gone through the course and graduated with honours.</p>
      <p>Mr Simon Sawer Tetteh, another graduate  also shared the idea of preserving the memory in photographs saying he snapped and printed almost 50 pictures.</p>
      <p>Mr Tetteh explained that apart from expressing his joy, the pictures would also serve as evidence that those in the pictures were his course mates as they may not see each other as often as they do when they were studying together.</p>
