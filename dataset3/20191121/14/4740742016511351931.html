      <h1>Six things you can do to help improve Bristol's relationship with food</h1>
      <h2>Bristol is currently a silver-rated Sustainable Food City</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:41:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:41</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew McQuarrie</a></address>
      <p>Bristol residents are being encouraged to grow their own food, cut down on sugar and host meals with neighbours.  </p>
      <p>The advice comes as Bristol bids to become the UK’s first gold-rated Sustainable Food City.</p>
      <p>The Going For Gold campaign, run by<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council"> Bristol City Council </a>and partners, seeks the accolade in 2020.</p>
      <p>Deputy Mayor Asher Craig said: “For me, winning gold is not the end game. We want to win gold and go beyond that as a city and keep moving forward.”</p>
      <p>A website has been launched laying out suggested ways for Bristol residents and organisations to build a better relationship with food.</p>
      <p>So far a total of 792 ‘actions’ have been registered by individuals, with a total of 237 by organisations.</p>
      <p>Ms Craig told Bristol Live she would like to see the number of individual actions rise to 50,000 by the time the application for gold status is lodged in autumn next year.</p>
      <p>“Anything below that [50,000] and I would be slightly disappointed,” said Ms Craig, who is steering the bid on behalf of the council and partners including the Bristol Food Network and the Bristol Green Capital Partnership.</p>

      <p>Bristol secured ‘silver’ status in 2016 and to date the city is one of only four across the UK to have hit that height, alongside Brighton, London and Middlesborough.</p>
      <p>Asked to give examples of actions that could help Bristol win 'gold', Ms Craig came up with six suggestions tying in with the Going For Gold themes.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Ms Craig wrote the following:</p>
      <p>1.      Buy better – look for products with less packaging and choose local, seasonal food</p>
      <p>2.      Reduce food waste – use up what’s in your fridge and recycle what can’t be eaten</p>
      <p>3.      Grow at home – try growing a food plant indoors, such as tomatoes or chillies</p>
      <p>4.      Be part of your community – host a meal, or share a your cooking and growing skills with others</p>
      <p>5.      Eat better – try a meat-free meal, cut down on sugar and cook from scratch</p>
      <p>6.      Support food equality – buy Fair Trade certified products and share your surplus food</p>
      <p>Ms Craig also recommended that residents should use their food waste bins whenever they can.</p>
      <p>"If you’ve got a brown caddy, make sure you use it. But also, when you’re cooking, make sure you have as little waste as possible," said Ms Craig, who went on to outline the praise that Bristol already receives for its approach to food.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-george">St George </a>West representative said: "I’m always stunned every time I meet other city leaders around the food agenda.</p>
      <p>"Everybody raves about Bristol and what we’re doing - the green agenda and food waste. We’re fast becoming a leading city when it comes to food."</p>
      <p>The Sustainable Food Cities scheme is run by the Soil Association, Food Matters and Sustain.</p>
