      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anton-du-beke/">Anton Du Beke</a> has defended Johannes Radebe and Graziano Di Prima’s same-sex routine after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/21/strictly-come-dancing-sex-routine-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-prima-sparks-200-complaints-bbc-11193004/">the BBC was stung by almost 200 complaints</a>.</p>
      <p>In a report of their most complained-about moments of the month so far, the broadcaster revealed 189 viewers took the time to criticise <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/strictly-viewers-hearts-burst-johannes-radebe-graziano-di-prima-perform-sex-routine-11035751/">the duo’s spellbinding performance to Emili Sandi</a>, which, like us, surprised the professional dancer.</p>
      <p>‘As a dancer, you just dance. It’s a sort of creative process, you’re just dancing,’ Anton said of Joahennes and Graziano’s routine. ‘That’s what you do as a performer, you create, we’re creating dance.’</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘I don’t think there’s anything controversial in the number itself.</p>
      <p>‘I danced with Vincent Simone years ago on Strictly and I also did a number with Brucey [Forsyth].</p>
      <p>‘I can’t say why they complained, it’s their own personal opinion about it but dance is dance, they’re just dancing. That’s all it is. All you’re doing is performing and you hope people enjoy it.’</p>

      <p>When asked about his opinion on whether Strictly should welcome same-sex partners on the show Anton, who’s touring the UK and Ireland with Erin Boag next year, admitted he’d be happy either way.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t really mind, to be honest with you,’ the fan-favourite dancer told us. ‘I don’t really have any opinion on it either way. If they have it on the show, fine, if they don’t have it on the show, fine.</p>

      <p>‘My question would be how would you judge same-sex couples within the context of the competition?</p>
      <p>‘I have no opposition to it, it would be interesting to see the criteria of the adjudicator would be.’</p>
      <p>Anton’s brand new DVD Anton’s Truly Madly Strictly is out for release on Sunday and is filled to the brim with sensational moments.</p>
      <p>‘It’s my favourite one,’ Anton enthused. ‘There are also bits in there of my own personal greatest hits.</p>
      <p>‘What you see on the DVD is how the show and everything evolves over the years, it’s fascinating really.</p>
      <p>‘All of the technical stuff from the production side of things to the dances and the dance style, and the couple’s choice, it’s brilliant.’</p>
