      <h1>Mizoram Bru refugees to be resettled in Tripura</h1>
      <h2>State govt. seeks permission from Home Ministry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:24:39+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Syed-Sajjad-Ali-665/" target="_blank">Syed Sajjad Ali</a></address>
      <p>The stand-off over 34,000 Mizoram Bru refugees in Tripura took a new turn with the Tripura government agreeing to rehabilitate them within the State. Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah to consider the proposal and sanction the necessary assistance to bring an end to a 22-year-old impasse.</p>
      <p>The issue of resettlement of the evacuees in Tripura gained strength after the latest repatriation arrangements under a Home Ministry-sanctioned rehabilitation package failed to take-off. Refugee leaders, who had signed a consent agreement after a four-corner meeting convened by the Home Ministry in New Delhi, backtracked citing continuation of an allegedly hostile environment in Mizoram.</p>
      <h3>Spelt out</h3>
      <p>Official sources on Thursday said the CM spelt out some suggestions in the letter to the Union Home Minister, which includes rehabilitation of the refugees at various in the State. He also requested that the Home Ministry-sponsored rehabilitation package be extended for those who will be resettled in Tripura.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister asserted that the State government could make progress over the whole range of issues only with endorsement of the Central government. He detailed the plight of refugees stranded in makeshift camps for many years.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the royal scion of Tripura and former State Congress chief Pradyot Kishore Manikya made a similar appeal to Home Minister Amit Shah. Mr. Manikya even argued that many of the refugees were original residents of Tripura and had to shift to Mizoram after being displaced, following the construction of a hydroelectricity project at Dambur in south Tripura in 1974-75.</p>
      <p>Thousands of Reang or Bru refugees took shelter in Kanchanpur of north Tripura in September 1997 to escape ethnic tension in Mizoram. At least seven repatriation attempts have failed in the past 22 years.</p>
