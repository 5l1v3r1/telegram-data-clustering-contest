        <b>Conor McKenna has expressed zero regrets over lining out for his club Eglish in a relegation playoff two weeks ago.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/mcorry/conor-mckenna-afl-solo-dummy/">The former Tyrone underage star</a> has been under contract with AFL side Essendon since 2014 and has firmly established himself in the club’s first-team squad.</p>
      <p>However, upon his return to Ireland, McKenna scored a goal for his club as they staved off relegation from Division 1 of the All-County Tyrone League much to the disappointment of his coaches down under.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-11-13/we-didnt-send-him-to-ireland-to-play-footy-woosha-really-disappointed-in-dashing-defender">SEN Radio</a> last week, coach <a href="https://punditarena.com/gaa/oisinmcqueirns2758/essendon-outline-disappointment-conor-mckenna/">John Worsfold</a> expressed disappointment in McKenna taking such a huge risk.</p>

      <p>“I was really disappointed when I heard that. We know that he’s passionate about his Gaelic footy, he’s passionate about footy. He’s an energetic young man, his personality is so up and about. I can imagine them saying, ‘Do you want to have a kick?’</p>
      <p>“It puts them [Irish AFL players who play GAA] at risk of an injury, of doing something that’s outside their contract. In effect, it puts them at high risk of costing themselves a contract or a lot of money if they get a serious injury.”</p>
      <p>However, the former Tyrone minor has now responded.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Michael Verney of the Irish Independent, McKenna outlined that he felt like he owed something back to the club.</p>

      <p>“The club is where you came from and that’s what brought you up and I wouldn’t really be in the position that I am in with the AFL unless it was for them and for the county,” McKenna said.</p>
      <p>“You feel like you owe them and I do owe them everything for what they have done for me. I came home before and sat there and watched them and it’s a very hard thing to do, so I came home and they had a relegation battle and I decided to play.”</p>
      <p>McKenna also stated that he believes the club will be understanding of his situation once he returns to Australia.</p>

      <p>“I haven’t really talked to the club much about it, I’ll talk to them when I go back. That was the decision I made so I’ll go back and see what the consequences are.</p>
      <p>“They know how much I miss home and how much Gaelic and home mean to me so I think they’ll be pretty understanding.”</p>
