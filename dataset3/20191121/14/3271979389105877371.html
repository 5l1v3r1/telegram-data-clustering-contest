      <p><b>Demi Lovato</b>’s friends are worried that her new boyfriend, model <b>Austin Wilson</b>, may be a bad influence on her? That’s the bogus claim from one tabloid this week. <b>Gossip Cop</b> found it totally fictional.</p>
      <p><i><b>Star</b></i> claims that Lovato’s new flame is causing trouble in her social circle. “He’s not exactly the nice, straitlaced boyfriend she should be with,” an unnamed “friend” of Lovato’s tells the magazine. “The concern is that Demi will slide back to her old ways. She’s crazy about him, but she’s always been attracted to edgy guys,” the source says. “They hang out at her place, watch movies and order takeout, but her friends are still worried he’s bad news.”</p>
      <p><b>Gossip Cop</b> ran the story by one of our sources in Lovato’s camp, who immediately dismissed it and noted that everyone was quite happy with the current state of things. The public nature of Lovato’s history with drugs means that tabloids are going to use it against her in any way they can. This piece seems to be a thinly veiled attempt at mischaracterizing the singer and her boyfriend as two people on the cusp of a relapse or helpless in the face of addiction. It’s simply cruel to everyone involved, including the couple and their friends. Both Lovato and Wilson have been sober for more than a year, and there’s absolutely no reason to doubt the strides each have made in dealing with addiction.</p>
      <p>Lovato <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxdjlGwh4Qe/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">actually dedicated an entire Instagram post to her friends</a> earlier this year, praising them for their compassion, patience and acceptance throughout her ups and downs. “And you’re so supportive of me and every little thing I do… most importantly you never abandoned me like others did when I was going through [expletive],” Lovato wrote. “You were there to listen, without judgement and only love and I can never fully express what that means to me.” The singer’s friends certainly aren’t the types to doubt her judgement or leak secrets to sketchy publications.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time <i>Star</i> has tried to capitalize on Lovato’s love life. In May, the tabloid incorrectly reported that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/demi-lovato-wilmer-valderrama-back-together/">Lovato was reuniting with ex-boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama</a>. The year before that, it falsely claimed <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/demi-lovato-jesse-williams-dating-flirting-wrong/">she was dating Jesse Williams</a>. The outlet continues to lack any sense of insight into the singer’s personal life, and we’ll continue to call them out for these baseless rumors.</p>
