      <p>Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami has rubbished superstar Rajinikanth's claim that the people of the state will witness a miracle or big surprise in 2021, when the elections to the state's assembly are due.</p>
      <p>Rajnikanth made the statement on Thursday while talking about a possible political alliance with his contemporary and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan. "In 2021, people of Tamil Nadu will 100 per cent create a big wonder and marvel in politics," he said in an apparent reference to the polls scheduled then and possibly about him coming to play a major role then.</p>

      <p>Dismissing his claims, CM Palaniswami said that Rajinikanth could not speak about political marvels unless he launches his party.</p>
      <p>"I don't know on what basis Rajinikanth believes that there will be a miracle in 2021," the CM said while speaking to media at the Tuticorin airport.</p>
      <p>CM Palaniswami went on to add that Rajinikanth could've spoken about AIADMK coming to power in 2021. "Only after he starts his party we can comment about him and his party," he said.</p>
