      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 21): Lower crude oil prices cut Petron Malaysia Refining &amp; Marketing Bhd's net profit for its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19) by 60% to RM34.42 million from RM85.54 million a year ago. This dragged earnings per share down to 12.7 sen from 31.7 sen.</p>
      <p>Quarterly revenue sank 16% to RM2.77 billion from RM3.3 billion, as volatile global oil prices persisted, with dated Brent averaging US$62 per barrel, down 18% from US$75 per barrel previously.</p>
      <p>Dated Brent hit its lowest level during the year in August at US$59 per barrel, resulting in inventory holding loss and lower gross profit during the third quarter, Petron said in a stock exchange filing.</p>
      <p>"Price differentials between finished products and Brent crude also narrowed, resulting in gross profit of RM99 million for the third quarter of 2019, compared to RM186 million posted during the same period last year," Petron said, adding its quarterly income for the quarter was cushioned by savings in operating expenses.</p>
      <p>The group also attributed the lower earnings to lower total sales volume of 8.8 million barrels, versus 9.1 million barrels in the same quarter last year. Export sales declined from the reduced production, due to the refinery’s scheduled maintenance, it said.</p>
      <p>For the nine months ended Sept 30, 2019 (9MFY19), its net profit fell 41% to RM148.16 million or 54.9 sen per sharefrom RM250.09 million or 92.6 sen per share last year, while revenue slipped 7% to RM8.54 billion from RM9.15 billion.</p>
      <p>This was despite sales volume growing to 27.1 million barrels during the period, from 26.9 million barrels previously (9MFY18). “Lower oil prices prevailed and negated the impact of sales volume growth,” Petron explained.</p>
      <p>On prospects, Petron said volatility in oil prices is expected to persist until a formal US-China trade deal is reached. It saidconcerns on increasing US shale and non-OPEC oil production, further adds to the price volatility.</p>
      <p>“[Notwithstanding]the challenging business environment, the company remains committed and on track in pursuing its various strategic programs to expand its retail network, upgrade its plant and facilities, and enhance efficiencies in its supply chain to support growing sales volume and to continue providing innovative products and better quality services to its customers,” Petron said.</p>
      <p>Petron shares rose eight sen or 1.6% to close at RM5.09 apiece today, valuing the company at RM1.37 billion. Over the past year, the counter has declined some 28% from RM7.07.</p>
