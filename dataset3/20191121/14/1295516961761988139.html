      <p>While <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/absolute-carnage/"><i>Absolute Carnage</i></a> may have just come to a thrilling end, Eddie Brock's troubles with the symbiotes are only getting deadlier in the pages of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/venom/"><i>Venom</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Marvel Comics has released its solicitation information for titles going on sale in February 2020, including <i>Venom</i> #23, by Donny Cates and Mark Bagley. A continuation of the creative team's "Venom Island" storyline kicking off next month, the solicit teases the issue is the start of the build-up to the next major symbiote-centric event in the Marvel Universe.</p>
