      </p>
      <p>There's an eerie silence often in this Bollywood producer's office nowadays. The culprit is his most trusted lieutenant who was once the apple of his eye. Well, the Boss' ears have been poisoned that his blue-eyed-boy is promoting his kith and kin, piggybacking on the big name of his company. Yes, certain ladies played the bad cop(s). Toh haan, the man in question has been asked to tone down his personal agenda else face the axe next year. Woh kehte hain na- blood is always thicker than water.<br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- spotboyeteam</i></p>
