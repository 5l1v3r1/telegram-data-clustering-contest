      <h1>Gary O'Neil breaks Aberdeen silence after midfielder fails to win Pittodrie deal</h1>
      <h2>The former Portsmouth, West Ham and QPR man had a spell training with the Dons earlier in the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:00:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Gary O'Neil has spoken for the first time after failing to secure a deal with Aberdeen.</p>
      <p>The Pittodrie side were exploring the possibility of signing the out-of-contract midfielder after training with <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/derek-mcinnes">Derek McInnes</a>' side earlier in the season.</p>
      <p>But a contract for the former Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, West Ham United, QPR and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/norwich-city-fc">Norwich City</a> did not materialise.</p>
      <p>O'Neil, 36, opened up on the failed move to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-premiership">Premiership</a> side and his struggles to find a new employer after he leaving Bolton at the end of last season.</p>

      <p>He said: “I am still keen to play, but have been without a club for a while and sometimes clubs look at that and think you’ve lost that competitive edge or that little bit of sharpness.</p>
      <p>“After Bolton I thought I’d get a club which suited me and was close to getting a couple, which then fell through and it ended up dragging on longer than I expected.</p>
      <p>“I was at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-fc">Aberdeen</a> for a little bit and nearly signed for QPR early in the summer, which would have been a great one in the Championship and London. That looked like it was going to happen, then didn’t towards the end.</p>
      <p>“I’ve turned other stuff down as well, it’s just the way things go.”</p>
