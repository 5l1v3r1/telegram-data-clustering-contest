      <p>Coach chose JLo as their newest ambassador because they both have deep roots in New York.  Coach was founded in the Big Apple 78 years ago, and Lopez is a Bronx native. She said that  she’s always felt connected to the label, she even featured its signature printed purses in her 2002 music video for “All I Have.”</p>
