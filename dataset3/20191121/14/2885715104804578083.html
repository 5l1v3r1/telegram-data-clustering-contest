      <p>
        <b>Ingredients</b>
      </p>
      <p>6-8 no. – Large carrots<br/>1/4 cup – Olive oil<br/>A pinch of salt<br/>6 cups – Vegetable stock<br/>1 inch – Peeled ginger<br/>Thyme for garnish<br/>1/2 cup – Large onion (chopped)<br/>2 no – Large garlic cloves (chopped)<br/>Black pepper, freshly ground</p>
      <p>
        <b>Method</b>
      </p>
      <p>*Peel and cut the carrots into half-inch rounds. On a rimmed baking sheet, toss the carrots with two tablespoons of olive oil and sprinkle them with salt generously.</p>
      <p>*Set an oven rack six to eight inches from the heat source and turn on the broiler. Broil the carrots until they brown and soften, turning them over with a spatula every five minutes or so; this should take 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>*Meanwhile, bring the stock to a boil, add ginger and the sprig of thyme and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Put the onion and the remaining olive oil in a medium stock pot. Brown the onion over medium heat and keep stirring frequently. Add the garlic, and then add the carrots.</p>
      <p>*Remove the ginger and thyme from the stock and add the stock to the pot with onions and carrots. Bring to boil and simmer for five to 10 minutes until the carrots are soft enough to puree.</p>
      <p>*Use an immersion or a standard blender to puree the mixture until smooth. If the soup seems too thick, add more stock or water and reheat gently.</p>
      <p>*Add salt and pepper to taste. To serve, garnish with chopped fresh thyme.</p>

        <figcaption>Fresh-tasting spinach soup is nutritious and delicious.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        <b>Ingredients</b>
      </p>
      <p>2 tsp – Olive oil<br/>2 no – Clove<br/>1/2 cup – Medium onion (finely chopped)<br/>1 cup – Potato (white; peeled and cubed)<br/>2 cups – Chicken broth (or vegetable broth; fat-free, low-sodium)<br/>2 cups – Milk (fat-free)<br/>1 bag – Baby spinach<br/>Black pepper (freshly ground, to taste)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Method</b>
      </p>
      <p>*In a large pan, heat the oil. Sauté the garlic, onion, and potato for five minutes.</p>
      <p>*Add chicken broth and fat-free milk. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>*Stir in half the spinach, cover, and simmer for 10 more minutes.</p>
      <p>*Cool slightly, and then transfer soup to a blender. Work in two batches, if necessary.</p>
      <p>*Serve hot.</p>
      <p>“When you make it, you will notice that the soup has a brilliant green colour. That’s because half of the spinach is reserved and blended into the soup after cooking. It’s a great trick that also helps retain all of the nutrients found in fresh spinach. If you wish to keep this soup vegetarian, simply opt for vegetable stock instead of chicken stock,” said Tyagi.</p>
