      <p>The Finnish government plans to reduce the time taken to grant <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/work-visas">work visas </a>to just one to two weeks by next year, the country's Minister of Employment, Harakka, said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The move was aimed at attracting more software professionals from countries like India, he said.</p>
      <p>"For these expert visas and for these expert work permits, which require a certain (level of) income, but are also on the express lane on permits, we are aiming to get these things handled in one or two weeks," the minister said.</p>
      <p>"We are looking to shorten the time frame. This we can achieve next year because we are shifting the whole process of immigration - work-based and study-based immigration - to my Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment from the Interior Ministry," he added.</p>
