      <h1>Dolly Parton's Heartstrings: Up and down melodrama series hits a bum note</h1>

      <p>There’s something about Dolly Parton that’s so charming and self-aware that you can’t help but fall in love with her and her all-too-real tales that she tells through song.</p>
      <p>So the movement over to a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/netflix/">Netflix</a> series in Heartstrings could have been amazing – with each episode focusing on a tale based on one of Dolly’s songs.</p>
      <p>Dolly plays narrator throughout the show, giving us a tour of Dollywood as she does so (then chucks in one or two cameos for good measure.)</p>
      <p>It’s a recipe for success for fans of the country legend everywhere…so it’s unfortunate that in some episodes it wasn’t given enough time to cook and is therefore really underdone.</p>
      <p>The eight-episode series has more ups and downs then the strumming of a guitar, with some seriously dark undertones and plot lines in every one you wouldn’t expect to be dealt with so head-on.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It’s a testament to Dolly we guess, who also executive produces the show, for continuing to be straightforward with her interpretation of a human’s struggles.</p>
      <p>But without her sugary sweet singing voice telling us is, the gloss has gone, and it becomes a little hard to swallow.</p>
      <p>Here’s what we thought of each installment – from the ones you can’t help but fall for to the ones you should maybe give a miss.</p>

      <h3>Sugar Hill</h3>
      <p>Sugar Hill tells the story of a man who after 60 years, has lost his wife, and so takes a trip down memory lane for one final goodbye.</p>
      <p>Met with a tricky background that saw them never get off the ground, their love story goes through decades, and always ends up back at their hometown of Sugar Hill.</p>
      <p>Sickly sweet and heartbreaking, Sugar Hill’s leading star Logan, played by Tom Brittney (Grantchester’s Will Davenport) goes back to his 50s heyday, where all he wanted was to play baseball and marry his dream girl.</p>
      <p>Zooming forward in time to an older Logan (Timothy Busfield) going through his memories with wife Harper, it’s a sad tale of grief.</p>
      <p>The only thing that’s odd is it is attached to such an upbeat song, which can be a little misplaced at times.</p>

      <h3>Down From Dover</h3>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>By the time we got to Down From Dover, we had to say outloud ‘can we please not have one story that doesn’t directly involve cancer in some way?!)</p>
      <p>Well…we got it. There was no cancer. However there was war, childhood pregnancy and racism… so take with that what you will.</p>
      <p>But Down From Dover is told in such a way that you buy in to it all, as two high school sweethearts are torn apart by her uber-religious family, and him heading off to war.</p>
      <p>Sent to a home for pregnant women for a ‘visit’ after discovering she’s expecting, Delilah has some decisions to make as her own father disowns her and her baby daddy is fighting.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile her love Lincoln Dollarhyde has vowed to write to her every day while out on the frontlines, by any means necessary.</p>

        <figcaption>Ginnifer Goodwin and Kathleen Turner bring one of the strongest episodes of the series (Picture: Netflix)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>These Old Bones</h3>
      <p>If there’s ever a case for Kathleen Turner being flawless in everything she does, These Old Bones is the tale for you.</p>
      <p>Starring alongside Once Upon A Time’s Ginnifer Goodwin, Turner stars as the Bones in question – a friendly and brassy old lady who can tell the future and lives in the woods.</p>
      <p>Ginnifer plays Genevieve, a former resident of the nearby town, who returns as a hotshot lawyer for a major company who wants Bone’s land – and will even take her to court for it.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Determined to prove herself to the big wig men who run the conglomerate, Genevieve is seen fighting between her heart and head as she gets attached to Bones.</p>
      <p>Throw in the arrival of a friendly neighbourhood lawyer in Landon (Kyle Bornheimer) and his son, who offers to take on Bones’s case, and Genevieve finds herself evaluating where her true priorities lie.</p>
      <p>Simple, sweet, and with an extra something that literally took me by surprise, These Old Bones may have caused me to shed a tear or two.</p>

        <figcaption>Family bonds run deep in If I Had Wings (Picture: Netflix)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>If I Had Wings</h3>
      <p>If I Had Wings tells the story of blood bonds no matter how close you are as a family.</p>
      <p>On their ailing dad’s birthday, his long-forgotten children are tracked down by his partner (Delta Burke) and invited over for the weekend.</p>
      <p>But after leaving their family when they were younger, there’s some bad blood and unsettled scores between his son Clay (Ben Lawson) and his sister (Brooke).</p>
      <p>Throw in the sudden arrival of a sister (Michele Weaver) they didn’t even know they had, and there’s a lot of explaining to do and hatchets to bury.</p>
      <p>This story is definitely emotional but it runs almost too fast, with most of the events happening over the course of one evening instead of being spread out over the course of a few days.</p>
      <p>There’s misplaced anger, weird connections and then a sudden switch of story that keeps you on your toes, so you’re never bored.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Another tearjerker on our hands, but like These Old Bones, it’s not a blubfest.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>A tale of friendship has some really hard-hitting moments (Picture: Netflix)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Cracker Jack</h3>
      <p>Based around four childhood friends, Cracker Jack sees the complicated women reunite for a girls weekend to catch up on old times.</p>
      <p>But their personal struggles aren’t too far behind, and soon their problematic marriages, health and happiness soon rise to the top – because noone knows each other more than your BFFs.</p>
      <p>Cracker Jack has an amazing loop hole that allows you to buy into the friendship and how well they know each other more than the other episodes because of their backstory that spans decades.</p>
      <p>It’s actually really sweet, and it would’ve probably done well if they were just given more time for the show to flourish.</p>
      <p>Total Hallmark movie realness, it’s melodramatic to the point of sickly sweet but in a way that makes you kind of enjoy watching what you’re seeing.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Jolene is the one fans were waiting for – with Julianne Moore playing the iconic character (Picture: Netflix)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>Jolene</h3>
      <p>Jolene is The Big One that everyone has been waiting for, with Julianne Hough playing the iconic character from the Dolly song about a potential man-snaring woman.</p>
      <p>It’s actually kind of cool that they decide to forego the route of woman v woman fighting over a man and actually made it a tale of female friendship, and insecurity.</p>
      <p>Trying to spice up a mellowed out marriage, a woman meets Jolene at her local Honky Tonk, becoming firm friends with her as a new lease of life.</p>
      <p>But when Jolene gets too close to her family, and her husband (Dallas Roberts) starts acting strangely, she becomes suspicious they’re having an affair.</p>
      <p>Jolene is what this show should really be – a simple watch with no real consequence and has some really good singing in it. This is what we want from Dolly.</p>
      <p>Though we defy anyone who can watch without glancing up at Julianne’s hairline and the wig that they’ve made her wear…</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <h3>Two Doors Down</h3>
      <p>Two Doors Down is an actual hot mess, and while we thought that this could’ve been the most charming of the lot, it actually handles some of its complex plot matters really poorly.</p>
      <p>Set at a wedding of the daughter of an affluent family, The Meegers are not your closest family – with secrets happening all over the place.</p>
      <p>The mother, most dominantly, is an absolute nightmare, and in her desperation for a picture perfect family, her way, at all times, she has pushed everyone else away.</p>
      <p>Her son is gay and in love with her personal assistant, her daughter wants to be a very awful actress in a very awful vampire film, and things are about to come tumbling out in a very public way.</p>
      <p>We end up literally watching her eat an entire wedding cake with her hands, which is not as funny as it sounds. It’s just a massive bummer.</p>
      <p>This is basically the feeling we get around Two Doors Down, even with a Dolly cameo at the end. It could’ve been executed in a much more fun way.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>JJ Sneed is meant to be a feminist tale of the Wild West (Picture: Netflix)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h3>JJ Sneed</h3>
      <p>After an incidental run in with the infamous outlaw JJ Sneed, Maddie Hawkins (Willa Fitzgerald) decides to join him on the run and they set off across country.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t take long for the dazzlingly attractive pair to start turning romantic, and Maddie has to keep her wits about her to earn the cash she needs.</p>
      <p>However, things aren’t always as they seem, and Maddie is soon in a little out of her depth when JJ suggests a bank heist.</p>
      <p>This episode is literally plugged as a feminist version of a Western, and we guess in some ways it is, but again it runs a little too long to the point nothing and everything happens at the same time.</p>
      <p>Colin O’Donoghue (aka Once Upon A Time’s Hook…seriously what’s with all the alumni from this show appearing here?) plays the scoundrel JJ, and is charming enough but it’s Willa that shines.</p>
      <h3>Verdict:</h3>
      <p>Against better judgement, there were definitely moments that are genuinely sweet and heartfelt in their execution.</p>
      <p>Were a tear or two shed at certain points? Absolutely. But that’s a testament to the actors and their ability on screen, rather than the material they had to work with.</p>
      <p>One can’t help but feel that the series would have benefitted if they cut the episode time down, upping the budget on the others, or even trimmed down the run time to make the plot lines tighter.</p>
      <p>But overall, the series is something that even the biggest Dolly fans could get away with missing, which is a shame when it had so much to give.</p>
