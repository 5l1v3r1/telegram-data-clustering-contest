      <h1>Liverpool fans will love what England rugby coach Eddie Jones had to say about Anfield experience</h1>
      <h2>Eddie Jones has named his visit to Anfield for the Champions League semi-final with Barcelona as the best sporting event he's attended</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:29:12+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/josh-challies/" target="_blank">Josh Challies</a></address>
      <p>England rugby coach Eddie Jones has stated that the best sporting event he has ever attended was the Champions League semi-final between Liverpool and Barcelona last season.</p>
      <p>The Reds famously <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-verdict-lionel-messi-leaves-16212374">fought back from a 3-0 defeat</a> in the first leg to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-anfield-16240912">win 4-0 on Merseyside</a> , sealing their spot in the final against Tottenham - which they then won to lift a sixth Champions League crown.</p>
      <p>A result that made headlines across the globe, Jones was fortunate enough to be in attendance for the match and spoke about the emotional scenes he witnessed.</p>
      <p>“The last game I saw was that Champions League semi-final, Liverpool and Barcelona at Anfield. It was the best sporting event I’ve been to,” he told TalkSport.</p>
      <p>“Just the atmosphere, I remember walking off and the girls that served all the dinner were all crying, just the total emotion that the ground has is incredible.”</p>
      <p>Considering Jones has led England to two Six Nations victories and the recent World Cup final, where he suffered defeat to South Africa, his declaration is certainly a huge compliment to Liverpool.</p>
