      <h1>Nelson: Who cares what Canada's two-seat former PM has to say about Alberta?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:58:43+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Nelson, For The Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>Well, if nothing else, you have to admire her sheer nerve.</p>
      <p>Here’s a person who led a major Canadian political party holding the reigns of power in a majority government into an election campaign that proved the most disastrous in our country’s entire history.</p>
      <p>But that was so many yesterdays ago. So today we’re supposed to listen with wide-eyed wonder as the one and only Kim Campbell takes us on a quickfire roundup of the present Canadian political scene.</p>
      <p>Yes, we hear her expert opinion on the growing Wexit movement, the recent electoral performance of current Tory boss Andrew Scheer and finally the need for politicians to engage the public in grown-up conversations.</p>
      <p>Wexit? “It’s just nuts,” said Campbell in a recent TV interview. Scheer? He left Conservatives “not quite sure where to go.” As for the current political climate: “We need to tackle the issues in an adult manner.”</p>
      <p>Really? Well before we look at the issues Campbell touched upon, let’s first regale ourselves by recapping the short yet undoubtedly memorable history of Canada’s 19th prime minister.</p>
      <p>We’ll start with some simple, dry numbers. When Campbell launched an election campaign as the current prime minister of Canada and leader of the Progressive Conservatives, her governing party had 156 seats in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>Barely a month later, on the remarkable evening of Oct. 25, 1993, her Tories were left with two MPs. Nope, that wasn’t two-score. Nor was it two-dozen. It was just two. Count them: Jean Charest and Elsie Wayne.</p>
      <p>Now the blame for this monumental electoral disaster doesn’t all rest on Campbell’s shoulders. The former leader of the PCs, Brian Mulroney, who stood down four months before that electoral day of infamy, certainly carries some responsibility.</p>
      <p>But come on: two seats? Even Elizabeth May managed more than that, for heaven’s sake. My budgie might win one.</p>
      <p>You could argue this is simply someone trying to rewrite history and reclaim a modicum of respect from a performance that was to election campaigns the way the Titanic is to nautical navigation.</p>
      <p>But before we go there, let’s examine the last of that unholy trinity of daft utterances: yes, the one about tackling issues in an adult manner. This escaped the lips of a person who announced, during that 1993 campaign fiasco, that the hustings were not the place to discuss serious social issues. Hey, looking back, it’s a wonder her party even got two seats.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there’s more to this latest pontificating than an attempt at face-saving. Maybe, given her regal dismissal of the Wexit movement, some latent animosity lingers in Campbell’s heart and is being reignited by the anger spreading across Alberta today.</p>
      <p>After all, it was Preston Manning’s Reform Party that obliterated her Tories in Alberta. The old PCs were done like dinner in our province, losing every seat where previously they’d held all but four.</p>
      <p>That outcome helped Liberal boss Jean Chretien dominate the federal scene for a decade afterwards, until Stephen Harper finally righted the very Tory ship that Campbell had left gaping and derelict on those jagged political rocks.</p>
      <p>She didn’t see it coming more than a quarter of a century ago and she doesn’t see it approaching now. Instead, still none the wiser, she tells Albertans to grow up and not be so angry.</p>
      <p>But such tone-deaf elitism actually feeds the very alienation so many in this province feel. It so often arises from those who pontificate, judge and lecture, yet, when given their turn in the spotlight, they fail in such a momentous manner that decades later it’s still hard to fathom.</p>
      <p>Yet they rarely suffer the way those who’ve lost jobs in this province have done during the past few years — after Campbell was booted from office Chretien appointed her Canada’s consul general to Los Angeles in 1996.</p>
      <p>So now she’s back, lecturing us on how we should think and feel. Yes, for sheer nerve it takes some beating.</p>
