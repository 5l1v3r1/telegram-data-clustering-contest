      <h1>DopeNation in trouble for allegedly defrauding a 19 year old underground musician</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:36:06+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/staff/" target="_blank">Nana Yaw</a></address>
      <p>Lynx Entertainment signed artist, DopeNation is in trouble after a mother of an underground artist revealed that the twin brothers have defrauded her 199-year-old-son of an amount of GHC2,000.</p>
      <p>The mother of the underground musician who goes by the name Dope Kid in a phone-in interview with Sammy Flex on Zylofon FM alleged that Dope Nation have defrauded her son.</p>
      <p>According to Madam Philomena, the music duo, Twist and B2 (Dope Nation) have refused to release “data” of a song sent to them by his son after they had paid an amount of GHS 2000 (instead of 3000) for four songs.</p>

      <p>She further says after reporting Dope Nation to the Achimota Mile 7 Police, nothing has been done about the issue with Dope Nation going ahead to take pictures with the commander in charge of the case and posting it on social media.</p>
      <p>All attempts by Sammy Flex to reach out to DopeNation and Richie Mensah for comments on the issue proved futile. Stay with <a href="https://www.ghbase.com/">Ghbase.com</a> for updates on this issue.</p>
