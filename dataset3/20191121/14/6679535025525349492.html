      <p>Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa will inaugurate the much-awaited Kalaburagi Airport on Friday. The Greenfield airport, located 5 km from the city, will put Kalaburagi on the aviation map of the country.</p>
      <p>Preparations were on full swing at the airport on Thursday when MP Umesh Jadhav and other representatives visited it for an inspection before the inauguration ceremony.</p>
      <p>Speaking to presspersons, Mr. Jadhav said that Mr. Yediyurappa will reach the airport in a Star Air flight for the inauguration. He will return to Bengaluru in the same flight at 1.55 p.m. to reach Bengaluru at 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Transport Lakshman Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education Ashwath Narayan, Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai will participate in the event.</p>
      <p>Officials from the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and Star Air Group Chairman Sanjay Ghodawat will be present.</p>
      <p>Asked about inviting the former Union Minister Mallikarjun Kharge to the programme, Mr. Jadhav tried to downplay it, saying that all political representatives from the region, cutting across party lines, have been invited.</p>
      <p>Executive Director (Engineering), Airport Authority of India, Delhi, H.S. Suresh told presspersons said that the infrastructure available at the airport with a runway of 3.27 km is sufficient for operating bigger aircraft such as Airbus 320. “With availability of 742 acres of land at the airport, we can expand the facilities in future without much hassle. In the coming days, we will plan to operate exclusive chartered flights for Haj pilgrims,” he added.</p>
      <p>After the formal inauguration of the airport on November 22, commercial flights will commence the same day. Star Air Marketing Head Raja Hesi and Star Air Head of Airport Services C.A. Boppanna said that Star Air flights will operate between Bengaluru and Kalaburagi three days a week — Monday, Friday and Sunday. Flights will leave Bengaluru at 12.20 p.m. to arrive at Kalaburagi at 1.25 p.m. In the return direction, flights will take off from Kalaburagi at 1.55 p.m. to land in Bengaluru at 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>Passengers will fly on Star Air 50-seat advanced aircraft manufactured by Embraer with two jet engines powered by Rolls Royce. “Initially, we will operate only on the Bengaluru-Kalaburagi route. We have planned to provide services on two more routes — Kalaburagi-Tirupati and Kalaburagi-Delhi (Hindon) by December,” Mr. Hesi added.</p>
