      <h1>This student became a licensed pilot on his 17th birthday and he is yet to complete high school</h1>

      <p>William Moore Jr. hasn’t graduated from high school, but he is a licensed private pilot, preparing to pursue his instrument rating.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old attended the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/OBAPExcellence/?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr">Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals</a> Aerospace Career Education Academy which exposes middle and high school youth to opportunities in aerospace and aviation through week-long summer camps.</p>
      <p>He is the first to complete the program which is endorsed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and has been invited to participate with the incoming class of students where he will inspire his peers on achieving their dream of becoming a PPL.</p>
      <p>Through the East Coast Chapter, Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. (ECCTAI) Youth in Aviation Program, Moore was accepted to attend ground school and he completed in the top of his class.</p>
      <p>Over the summer, he reportedly flew at Potomac Airfield through HJ Aviation, LLC with most of his hours towards dual flight instruction covered by the ECCTAI YIAP</p>
      <p>He was even said to have met an original Tuskegee Airman Herbert H. Jones Jr., the man whom his flight school was named after. Jones cheered him to remain dedicated.</p>
      <p>He was also selected and awarded a scholarship from Delta Air Lines to attend the National Flight Academy for a 2019 Summer Deployment 19-06. “We are so proud of our son. He set goals, was determined to pass his FAA exam the first time and also spoke into existence that he would achieve his PPL on his birthday,” his parents, Kamesha Moore and father William Moore Sr. <a href="https://www.blacknews.com/news/william-moore-jr-17-year-old-becomes-licensed-private-pilot/">said</a>.</p>
      <p>The young teenager commenced his first flight lesson on April 28, 2019 and completed his first solo on June 28, 2019 and amazingly received his private pilot’s license on his birthday October 15, 2019.</p>
      <p>“Last week William celebrated his 17th birthday passing the oral portion of the exam for his private pilot’s license and by taking a flight with his instructor. We need more like Moore,” said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson while introducing audiences at the National Business Aviation Association to Moore Jr.</p>
      <p>In future, Moore Jr. hopes to become a commercial airline pilot or a cargo pilot as well as serve his country as a military C-5/C-17/C-130 pilot.</p>
      <p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, figures from last year show less than 3% of US commercial pilots are African Americans.</p>
      <p>The Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals serves a leading role in establishing ACE Academies nationwide to introduce, educate and guide diverse students towards careers in aviation.</p>
