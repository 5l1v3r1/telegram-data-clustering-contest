      <p>Brad Woodhouse found a new purpose in life after facing gruelling treatment for a rare type of brain cancer – and has now launched an app to help others stay healthy.</p>
      <p>The entrepreneur was diagnosed with cancer when he was just 24, and he had to undergo four major operations on his brain in a matter of weeks.</p>
      <p>‘From signing a will, to saying goodbye to my parents and family to then waking up after 13 hours of brain surgery, and I mean really waking up, my whole purpose in life had shifted,’ says Brad.</p>
      <p>‘I was acknowledging a primal need in the pit of my stomach to help people.’</p>
      <p>While Brad was recovering from the life-threatening illness and painful surgery that left him with PTSD and survivor’s guilt, he began creating <a href="https://weldbeing.com/">WELD</a>, an online health and fitness appdesigned to challenge the ‘outdated’ health and fitness industry in the UK.</p>

      <p>WELD stands for Wellbeing, Exercise, Lifestyle and Diet, and aims to make getting and staying fit and healthy more accessible and affordable.</p>

      <p>‘I want to make it easier for people to live a healthier and more active life,’ says Brad.</p>
      <p>‘After I was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2011, and had four surgeries in three months, I finally came out at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p>‘I had survived, and I had to believe I survived for a reason. People began contacting me regarding their recent cancer diagnoses and wanted to hear my approach, what I ate, what I drank, how I exercised, and what my physical and mental state was.</p>
      <p>‘It was in those moments of sharing my experience and advice that I felt like I had found something, I had found purpose.’</p>

      <p>Brad still has 30 per cent of the tumour lodged in his brain, but is currently in remission. He’s now 32 and lives in north London with his wife and young son, and says that he appreciates every moment he has with them.</p>
      <p>He now takes his personal fitness and health incredibly seriously and competes as an endurance athlete in his spare time.</p>
      <p>Brad developed the app to help people maintain their health and fitness: ‘You have the choice of duration, type of session, health professional, session fee, and location that suits your needs all through one platform,’ he explains.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘It’s actually hard to find a simple way to access the market of health professionals, and to learn more about them through an open and transparent reviews system, where the professionals, premises owners and users all rate each other.</p>
      <p>‘You can also see the health professionals’ and premises’ rates, which they can change at their discretion.’</p>
