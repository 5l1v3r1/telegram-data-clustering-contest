      <p>The road to success is usually not smooth as expected and as such, legendary music producer, <a href="http://concisenews.global/entertainment/">Don Jazzy</a> has recounted how he almost gave up at the genesis of the record label.</p>
      <p><a href="http://concisenews.global/">Concise News</a> reports that the producer, in series of tweets hailed Burna Boy who bagged Grammy award nomination, while he revealed that he almost gave up on his goals.</p>
      <p>Sharing an old photo of himself Tiwa Savage, Wande Coal, Dr, Sid and D’Prince, DOn Jazzy wrote “Everyone has their goal. I almost gave up on mine in the early days of MAVIN. As you can see in this throwback pic. I looked fed up lol . But man had to keep pushing. May you reap the rewards of all your hard work last last o.”</p>
      <p>“I looked fed up lol ? . But man had to keep pushing. May you reap the rewards of all your hard work last last o ??” he added.</p>
