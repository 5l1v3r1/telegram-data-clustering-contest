      <p>The key to a better future as an individual and the nation is to equip oneself with a sound education. At Singapore (Cambodia) International Academy (SCIA), we offer opportunities to students to fast track their way to an overseas degree at the Foundation Studies Centre (FSC).</p>
      <p>This unique and reputable programme prepares youths for pre-university as well as for a university degree.</p>
      <p>As a young student embarking on your future career, please ask yourselves the following questions:</p>
      <p>- <b><i>What’s my future vocation?</i></b></p>
      <p>- <b><i>What are the jobs of the future that are highly sought after?</i></b></p>
      <p>- <b><i>How do I get to a university?</i></b></p>
      <p>- <b><i>Will university education ensure my employability?</i></b></p>
      <p>- <b><i>What are the available pathways to universities?</i></b></p>
      <p>- <b><i>What can I do to prepare myself for further studies?</i></b></p>
      <p>The foundation programmes offered by SCIA Foundation Studies Centre is holistic and emphasises a strong foundation in preparing youths to excel in the university and the future. One of the most important decisions you will ever make is to decide on the career that is right for you. This decision is closely-linked to the study pathway you choose.</p>
      <p>As Cambodia’s economy becomes more sophisticated and diversified, there will be a need to fill vacancies in strategic sectors. Having a deep training in various skills becomes vital in meeting the demands of local employers.</p>
      <p>Studying abroad exposes students to various competencies, skills and attributes required for the real world that may not be available locally. Towards this end, SCIA provides young local Cambodian students with the clarity to unlock their potential in higher education.</p>

      <p>SCIA does this by identifying career aspirations and providing several potential educational pathways after high school through foundation studies/pre-university education and courses.</p>

        <b>Foundation Studies/University </b>
        <br/>
        <b>Foundation Programmes</b>
      </p>
      <p>Foundation Studies are pre-university courses and usually span over a one-year duration. They are designed for students looking to study abroad and include excellent study skills support. Students undertaking foundation studies will be able to embark on subjects relevant to their chosen degree as they provide a strong foundation to pursue the degree.</p>
      <p>This greatly eases the students’ transition to university life, familiarises them with a university environment and helps them to develop academic skills needed for undergraduate studies.</p>
      <p>The passing rate in foundation studies is high, students should choose foundation programmes with care to ensure progression to their degree of choices.</p>
      <p>Students who wish to study overseas should choose carefully and opt for internationally recognised foundation programmes.</p>
