      <p>Reigning women’s flyweight champion, Valentina Shevchenko, will make her next 125-pound title defense against <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/19/20972220/latest-ufc-rankings-conor-mcgregor-continues-fade-shogun-rua-dropped-top-15-mma">No. 1-ranked</a> division contender, Katlyn Chookagian, at the upcoming UFC 247 pay-per-view (PPV) event, scheduled for Sat., Feb. 8, 2020 inside Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.</p>
      <p>That’s according to a report from <a href="https://www.espn.com/mma/story/_/id/28129244/valentina-shevchenko-third-flyweight-defense-february-ufc-ppv">ESPN</a>.</p>
      <p>Shevchenko (18-3) is coming off her unanimous decision win over Liz Carmouche in the UFC Fight Night 156 main event last August. It was “Bullet’s” fourth straight win and second straight title defense in the flyweight division after a successful run at bantamweight.</p>
      <p>As for Chookagian (13-2), she’s racked up a pair of decision wins over Joanne Calderwood and Jennifer Maia after coming up short against Jessica Eye late last year. “Blonde Fighter” holds a 6-2 record under the UFC banner with wins over Lauren Murphy and Alexis Davis.</p>
      <p>UFC 247 will also feature the heavyweight showdown between Ilir Latifi and Derrick Lewis, in what marks the 265-pound debut for “The Sledgehammer.” Elsewhere on the card, Ovince Saint Preux collides with Ryan Spann while Juan Adam answers the call of Justin Tafa.</p>
