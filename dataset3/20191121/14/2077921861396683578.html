      <p>Just two months after its debut, Amazon’s debut adult animated series <i>Undone</i> has been renewed for a second season, per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/undone-renewed-season-2-at-amazon-1256810"><i>THR</i></a>. The groundbreaking and genre-bending animated series follows a young woman’s complex journey to unlock her past and solve the mystery of her father’s death.</p>
      <p><i>Undone</i> stars Rosa Salazar (<i>Alita: Battle Angel</i>) as Alma Winograd-Diaz, who takes her mundane life one day at a time until a near-fatal accident induces visions of her late-father, Jacob (<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Bob+Odenkirk">Bob Odenkirk</a>, <i><a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tag/Better+Call+Saul">Better Call Saul</a></i>). The series also stars Angelique Cabral (<i>Life in Pieces</i>), Constance Marie (<i>Elena of Avalor</i>), Siddarth Dhananjay (<i>Patti Cake$</i>) and Daveed Diggs (<i>Blindspotting</i>).</p>
      <p>Brought to life using rotoscope animation by Austin-based Minnow Mountain, <i>Undone</i> is the first animated series that utilizes the process. Directed by Dutch artist Hisko Hulsing, the series utilizes a variety of mediums, worked on by Amsterdam-based animation studio Submarine, including oil painting on canvas to render the backgrounds.</p>
      <p>Co-creators Kate Purdy and Raphael Bob-Waksberg said in a statement to <i>THR</i>, “We are thrilled Amazon Studios is giving us the opportunity to keep exploring this world and these characters, and we look forward to seeing where the story takes us next—but since time is a construct, in a way, we already made the second season and you have always been watching it all along.”</p>
