      <h1>ESPN’s Adam Schefter Thinks NFL Team Should Move To Mexico City</h1>

      <p>There’s been a lot of talk about the Los Angeles Chargers and where they belong since the franchise decided to move from San Diego. ESPN’s Adam Schefter gave his suggestion this morning.</p>
      <p>The ESPN NFL insider believes the Chargers should move to Mexico City. Los Angeles’ second NFL team just played the Kansas City Chiefs in Mexico on Monday night.</p>
      <p>“The Chargers had more fans, more support in Mexico City by a landslide than they do in Los Angeles,” he said on ESPN’s <i>Get Up!</i> this morning.</p>
      <p>“The Chargers should move to Mexico City where their fan base and their following is much more passionate than it is in Los Angeles.”</p>

      <p>An NFL team will probably end up in Mexico City at some point, but the Chargers seem committed to Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going anywhere. We’re playing in Los Angeles. This is our home. This is where I’m planning to be for a long f—ing time. Period,” Chargers owner Dean Spanos said earlier this month.</p>
