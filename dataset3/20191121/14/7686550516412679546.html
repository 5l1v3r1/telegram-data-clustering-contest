      <h1>Ann Summers reveals how often UK couples have sex</h1>
      <h2>Thousands of people were asked to reveal their bedroom habits</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T14:32:33+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 14:32</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>A survey of 2,000 people in relationships in the UK has revealed how often we have sex - and how often people enjoy it.</p>
      <p>Retailer Ann Summers conducted the survey to take the sexual health of the nation as part of its <a href="https://www.annsummers.com/page/pleasure-positive.html">Pleasure Positivity Project</a> campaign - which found that women miss out on 1,734 orgasms in their lifetime.</p>
      <p>As part of the project, this research is intended to find out why this gap exists by exploring British sexual habits and communication in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>The survey found one-in-five British women very rarely or never feel fully satisfied after ordinary sex with their partner.</p>
      <p>Looking at how often it happens, 49% of Brits in relationships said they have sex at least once a week, with the highest percentage (19%) having sex two or three times a week.</p>
      <p>The study also found that one-in-ten Brits in relationships never have sex at all.</p>
      <p>The research found that only two-in-five (42%) women feel fully satisfied after sex with their partner, compared to 52% of men.</p>
      <p>When it comes to communication in the bedroom, 59% of Brits said they feel comfortable discussing their sexual desires with their partner and 40% discuss their sex life with their partner on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>Despite this, 20% of British women said they’re not comfortable discussing any sexual subjects with their partner.</p>
      <p>When it came to sexual fantasies, trying a new position (24%) and using sex toys (20%) were the most common. One-in-five women (21%) chose using sex toys as their number one fantasy, making it the most popular choice for females.</p>
      <p>Laura Whittaker, Senior Manager at Ann Summers said of the research: "Launching the Pleasure Positivity Project was a big step forward for female sexual empowerment, but we knew there was much work to do to diagnose the Orgasm Gap problem.</p>
      <p>"This research allows us to get an insight into how couples are communicating about sex, and the results show many issues that need to be addressed.</p>
      <p>"The fact that one-in-five women don’t feel comfortable discussing the fact they’re missing out on orgasms means that they’re suffering in silence.</p>
      <p>"We find it important to share the best ways of communicating and the Pleasure Positivity Project will focus on this, continuing to empower women when it comes to their sexual confidence."</p>
