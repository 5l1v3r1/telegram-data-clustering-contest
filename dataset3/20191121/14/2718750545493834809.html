The 2019 <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/national-book-awards-2019-finalists.html">National Book Awards</a> for fiction, nonfiction, poetry, young people’s literature, and translated literature were awarded Wednesday night. For fiction, first-time nominee <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/03/spring-books-preview-includes-sally-rooney-susan-choi.html">Susan Choi’s novel</a> about a performance-arts high school in the ’80s, <i>Trust Exercise</i>, took home the prize. Choi was previously a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize with her book <i>American Woman</i>. “This book is collaboration more so than any other book I’ve written,” Choi said in her acceptance speech at the National Book Awards, per <a href="https://ew.com/books/2019/11/20/2019-national-book-awards-winners/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a>. “Given what we’re all facing today, I find it an astonishing privilege what I get to do every day. I get to lead a life centered on books and bring other people into that world.”</p>
      <p>As for the other works, Sarah M. Broom won the nonfiction prize for her debut book, <i>The Yellow House</i>, which details her family’s history in New Orleans. For young people’s literature, Martin W.
