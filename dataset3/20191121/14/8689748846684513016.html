      <p>A woman identified as Philomena has made a wild allegation against music duo, Dope Nation for defrauding her son called Dope Kid an amount of ¢2,000.</p>
      <p>The woman who spoke on Zylofon FM explained that the twins, Twist and B2 refused to help her son release a song dubbed ‘Data’ sent to them after they parted away with ¢2,000 after they were initially charged ¢3,000 for four songs.</p>
      <p>The aggrieved woman said she lodged a complaint at the police station at Achimota Mile 7 but nothing was done about the issue because of their status.</p>
      <p>Madam Philomena said instead of arresting Dope Nation, the police rather invited them and took pictures with them which they posted on social media.</p>
