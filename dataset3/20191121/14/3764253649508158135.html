      <p>Just recently, <b>Legit.ng</b> reported that doting father, David '<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277087-davido-shows-off-his-baby-ifeanyi-adeleke-in-adorable.html">Davido' Adeleke, shared a cute snap of himself and his son, Ifeanyi, taking a nap.</a></p>
      <p>From indications, a third party who had walked in on the father and son could not help taking a boomerang video as they were sleeping, seeing as the sight was too cute to be ignored.</p>
