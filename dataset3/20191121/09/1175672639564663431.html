      <h1>Acne Studios taps into fashion-school cool for interiors of Stockholm HQ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:54+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/natasha-levy/" target="_blank">Natasha Levy</a></address>
      <p>A 1970s brutalist-style building in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/stockholm/">Stockholm</a> is now home to <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/acne-studios/">Acne Studios</a>' headquarters, which is decked out with furnishings by <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/max-lamb/">Max Lamb</a> and huge wall-hangings by Daniel Silver.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.acnestudios.com/">Acne Studios</a>' headquarters – which has been monikered Floragatan 13 after the street it's located on – takes over Stockholm's former Czechoslovakian embassy.</p>
      <p>The building was erected in 1972 by Czech architect Jan Bočan, but has now been transformed by the brand's in-house design team and <a href="https://www.norlander.se/">Johannes Norlander Arkitektur</a> to have a "fashion-school atmosphere" where new ideas are encouraged.</p>
      <p>The focus on creativity is also meant to reflect the meaning behind the acronym that informed the brand's name, ACNE: Ambition to Create Novel Expressions.</p>

      <p>"When we started looking for a new building, I made a sketch of the way fashion design works," said Acne Studios' creative director, Jonny Johansson.</p>
      <p>"I wanted the arteries of fashion to flow, with a building that captures the feeling of constant progress, of an experimental place," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Acne Studios is always evolving, and I want this space to evolve with us. We will continue to add details in the months and years ahead. I believe design is alive, whether it's fashion or interiors."</p>

      <p>The ground level of the building plays host to an expansive library filled with art and fashion books, which staff members can flip through when in need of inspiration.</p>
      <p>Dotted throughout are a number of tubular red-leather sofas, parts of which have been upholstered in contrasting fabrics.</p>
      <p>Glass pendant lamps by French lighting designer Benoit Lalloz dangle from the ceiling, completed in a deep-pink hue that "brings softness" to the surrounding concrete surfaces.</p>

      <p>At the centre of the room is an organically-shaped silver table by British designer Max Lamb, who <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2016/11/16/acne-studios-flagship-store-max-lamb-furniture-interior-new-york-city-usa/">furnished Acne Studios' store on New York's Madison Avenue back in 2016</a>.</p>
      <p>Lamb has also used craggy blocks of stone to craft a series of chairs for the building's lobby, where select pieces from Acne Studios' clothing collections will be displayed like artworks in a gallery.</p>

      <p>Four floors of the building have been dedicated to the design and production departments, while the staff canteen is set within the embassy's old cinema room.</p>
      <p>Here there are a couple of floor-to-ceiling wall hangings by London-based artist Daniel Silver, composed from abstract offcuts of surplus Acne Studios fabric.</p>
      <p>Meetings can take place in the sixth-floor boardroom, which features a sunken sofa and fireplace – a homely decor detail which is meant to nod to the fact that this level of the building previously served as the ambassador's private residence.</p>

      <p>The bold aesthetic of Acne Studios' HQ extends to its retail spaces – last year the brand opened a branch in West Hollywood <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2018/03/26/acne-studios-yellow-store-interior-west-hollywood-los-angeles/">where almost every wall is painted a pale shade of acid yellow</a>.</p>
      <p>Back in 2017 it also threw open the doors to its Milan flagship, which <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/07/09/acne-studios-opens-pink-ceilinged-flagship-store-milan-brera-interior-design/">features shiny aluminium fixtures and a pink ceiling</a>.</p>
