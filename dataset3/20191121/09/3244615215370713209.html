      <h1>Apple Locks Top Secret-Spiller Out of His Developer Account</h1>

      <p>Guilherme Rambo, one of the top Apple secret-spillers, <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/667284/apple-locks-top-secret-spiller-out-of-his-developer-account/">says Apple locked him out of his developer account</a>, preventing him from accessing critical tools needed to create and update iOS and Mac apps. From a report:<i> In a blog post detailing his problem, Rambo <a href="https://rambo.codes/personal/2019/11/20/apple-has-locked-me-out-of-my-developer-account.html">revealed</a> that Apple locked him out in August. Since then, all his attempts to resolve the issue met a dead end, he says. Rambo's post doesn't mention that he digs through Apple beta software looking for clues about unreleased Apple products -- and publishes his findings on 9to5Mac. That might be the precise reason why he's locked out. A famously secretive company, Apple historically took harsh measures against leakers and rumor mongers.</i></p>
