      <h1>Dumfries and Galloway Climate Group host General Election hustings in Castle Douglas</h1>
      <h2>The debate on Friday night will focus on climate change and efforts to address the climate emergency</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:17:04+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:17</time> by <a rel="author">Stephen Norris</a></address>
      <p>Castle Douglas is to host the first Dumfries and Galloway constituency hustings of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>And organisers Dumfries and Galloway Climate Group are hoping for a good turnout for the Parish Church Hall event.</p>
      <p>The hustings will focus on climate change and efforts to address the climate emergency at all levels.</p>
      <p>Dumfries and Galloway Climate Group spokesperson Laura Moodie will chair the meeting.</p>
      <p>“We are inviting people to email their questions in beforehand,” Ms Moodie told the News.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“But we will also take questions from the floor as well.</p>
      <p>“We went for the church hall because it has a capacity of around 100.</p>
      <p>“Based on the feedback we have received we expect a decent turnout.”</p>

      <p>All four confirmed candidates for the Dumfries and Galloway seat were invited.</p>
      <p>Conservative Alister Jack said he had a prior commitment and will not be attending.</p>
      <p>His place on the panel will be taken by Finlay Carson MSP.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Ms Moodie added: “This is the first election that has taken place since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report was published.</p>
      <p>“We are keen to ensure that representatives from all parties standing for election have policies in place to rapidly address the climate crisis while we still have time to effect change.”</p>
      <p>Just 12 years remain to prevent global average temperatures rising to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the (IPCC) warned.</p>
      <p>The report predicted that should that target be missed devastating changes for eco-systems and habitats could result.</p>
      <p>D&amp;G Climate Group has more than 150 affiliates from across the constituency.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/dumfries-galloway">The hustings on Friday November 22 start at 7pm.</a>
