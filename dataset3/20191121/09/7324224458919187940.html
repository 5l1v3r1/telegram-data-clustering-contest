      <h1>Grady Diangana: Good guy Slaven Bilic has no West Brom favourites</h1>
      <h2>Grady Diangana has described Slaven Bilic as a ‘good person’ and revealed he gets no preferential treatment from the boss despite their West Ham ties.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:50:15+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>It was during Bilic’s time in charge of the Hammers that Diangana got introduced to senior football with the head coach inviting the youngster to join up with the first-team for training.</p>
      <p>The Croatian was also influential in bringing the 21-year-old to The Hawthorns – with Diangana initially set to join Championship rivals Derby on a temporary basis.</p>
      <p>Bilic, though, made a last minute call to his former employers in a bid to hijack the deal.</p>
      <p>And Diangana has since gone on to shine for the Baggies with the winger having scored four goals and registered five assists in 15 outings.</p>
      <p>But despite their history, Diangana says Bilic doesn’t treat him differently to any other player.</p>
      <p>And the forward also revealed what his head coach said to be him to convince him to join Albion.</p>
      <p>“It was amazing,” Diangana said. “He (Bilic) gave me a call and explained to me his vision and how he wanted his team to set up, and how he wanted us to play. It all started from there.</p>
      <p>“When we were both at West Ham I was back and forth (between the academy and first team).</p>
      <p>“I trained a few times with the first team.</p>
      <p>“And then when I got to Albion he (Bilic) was very welcoming.</p>
      <p>“He’s helped me to develop my game and for me, he was very important in my decision.</p>
      <p>“And ever since things have gone very well.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an amazing season so far for us.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of work still to do. But I’m enjoying it.”</p>
      <p>Asked if he feels he ever gets preferential treatment from Bilic, Diangana said: “No – I think he treats everyone the same and gives everyone respect.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t pick one out more than any other.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good person.”</p>
      <p>While Diangana was keen to sing Bilic’s praises, Albion coach Julian Dicks believes the winger deserves credit for the way he has conducted himself since joining the club on loan.</p>
      <p>Dicks was appointed first-team coach at The Hawthorns in the summer and works with assistant head coaches Dean Racunica and Danilo Butorovic in supporting Bilic.</p>
      <p>The former defender enjoys cult status at West Ham having played for the club in two separate spells.</p>
      <p>And when asked about Diangana he said: “He is a great lad.</p>
      <p>“He is very polite and for me that’s a very big thing because manners cost nothing.</p>
      <p>“You say good morning to everybody.</p>
      <p>“Even if you don’t like people you say good morning, you hold the door open for them. That’s just the way I am and he’s exactly the same.</p>
      <p>“He’s a very polite young man.”</p>
