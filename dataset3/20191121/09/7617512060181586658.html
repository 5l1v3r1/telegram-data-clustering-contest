      <p>Two cyclists were struck by vehicles in separate crashes in Greater Victoria this morning.</p>
      <p>One cyclist was struck in the downtown Victoria intersection of Broad and Yates streets at about 6:30 a.m. The cyclist sustained minor injuries.</p>
      <p>The driver failed to yield at a stop sign, said Victoria Const. Cody Lapierre.</p>
      <p>The cyclistâ€™s lights were initially considered a factor but police determined the bike was equipped with proper lighting.</p>
      <p>At about 8:20 a.m. another cyclist and vehicle collided in Saanich. That crash occurred at a Cedar Hill Cross Road intersection where Epsom Drive becomes Braefoot Road.</p>
      <p>B.C. Ambulance paramedics were on the scene. No information was available on the condition of the cyclist.</p>
