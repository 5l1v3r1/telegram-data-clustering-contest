      <h1>Cage Warriors announce seven new dates for 2020 including inaugural Manchester event</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:24:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Carroll</a></address>
      <p>Cage Warriors is set for its most active calendar year with to date with 15 events in 2020 and on Thursday morning the promotion announced seven more of the dates for the packed schedule - including an inaugural Manchester event.</p>
      <p>Following a successful return to Cork, Ireland earlier this month, the promotion announced three Irish dates between Cork and Belfast, Northern Ireland. Cage Warriors now have 10 dates solidified for next year with addition of shows in their usual stomping grounds of Cardiff, Birmingham, London as well as the Manchester bow on March 7.</p>
      <p>So far, this is what the promotion’s schedule looks like in 2020:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>March 7 - Manchester</li>
        <li>March 20 - London</li>
        <li>April 18 - Birmingham</li>
        <li>May 16 - Belfast</li>
        <li>Jun. 13 - Cardiff</li>
        <li>Jun. 20 - London</li>
        <li>Jul. 25 - Cork</li>
        <li>Sept. 26 - Belfast</li>
        <li>Oct. 10 - Birmingham</li>
        <li>Nov. 27 - London</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Newly crowned bantamweight champion and Mancunian Jack Cartwright will have a keen eye on the Manchester date, which will likely host his first title defense. The last two fighters to hold the title - <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/5111/jack-shore">Jack Shore</a> and <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/3738/nathaniel-wood">Nathaniel Wood</a> - gained UFC contracts on the back of their runs with the European promotion.</p>
      <p>“Finding and building the next biggest stars of the sport is simply what we do, and 2020 will be no different,” said Boylan, according to the press release.</p>
      <p>“15 events is the most we’ve ever put on in a single year. It means we can return to places where we’re established to keep giving local fighters a platform to grow - and giving fans the fights they want to see - but also to break into new cities that have called for Cage Warriors shows for a while. We’re turning up the dial next year, that’s for sure.”</p>
