      <p>A secretive $120 billion hedge fund, founded by a Cold War codebreaker and math professor, vastly outperformed Warren Buffett over the past 30 years.</p>
      <p>Renaissance Technologies, which was created by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jim-simons-interview-scientists-save-wall-street?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Jim Simons,</a> counts Chipotle and Facebook among its largest investments. It recorded an annualized, post-fee return of 39% at its flagship Medallion fund between 1988 and 2018, according to “The Man Who Solved The Market: How Jim Simons launched the Quant Revolution,” a new book by Greg Zuckerman.</p>
      <p>The 39% gain – 66% before fees – trumps returns of <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2018ltr.pdf">about 16%</a> at Buffett’s <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/brk-a-stock">Berkshire Hathaway</a> and 10% from the <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/index/s&amp;amp;p_500">S&amp;P 500</a> over the same period.</p>
      <p>Medallion’s remarkable performance means a dollar invested in the fund in 1988 would have grown to about $27,000 net of fees by the end of 2018, dwarfing a $107 return from Berkshire Hathaway and a $20 total return from the benchmark index.</p>
      <p>While the Medallion fund is restricted to Renaissance employees, the hedge fund’s remarkable track record means its trading patterns are worth noting. Its 10 biggest investments, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037389/000103738919000272/xslForm13F_X01/renaissance13Fq32019_holding.xml">based on a SEC filing</a> for the quarter ended 30 September, are listed below.</p>
