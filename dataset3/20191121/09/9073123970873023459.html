        <b>The Fortnite Week 7 ‘Trick Shot’ challenges are now live. Take a look at what you’ll have to do.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’re into week 7 of Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1. Traditionally, that would mean that there are only three or four more weeks left in the season if you account for Overtime challenges.</p>
      <p>We’re getting into the Holiday season, though, and Epic likes to take breaks around this time of the year. Recent information has it that Season 2 will be pushed back into February of 2020 – so there’s no rush to complete these ASAP.</p>

      <p>Here are all of the week 7 challenges for those who want to get their Alter EGO challenges over with.</p>

      <p>The challenges are relatively easy this week. You won’t have to do too much searching around, and we’ll have you covered for the challenges that do require a bit of discovery.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eliminations while at 50 Health or less (0/2)</li>
        <li>Consume Foraged Apples at The Orchard (0/3)</li>
        <li>Eliminations at Weeping Woods or a Landmark (0/3)</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-trick-shot-guide-pipeman-hayman-and-timber-tent-locations/27932/">Dance at the Pipeman, the Hayman, and the Timber Tent</a>
        </li>
        <li>Gain Health with a Small Fry, a Flopper and a Slurp Fish</li>
        <li>Eliminations with Pistols (0/3)</li>
        <li>Visit Named Locations in a single match (0/3)</li>
        <li>Damage with Shotguns (0/500)</li>
        <li>Save yourself from fall damage by landing in a hideout</li>
        <li>Heal yourself within 10 seconds after taking damage from an opponent</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/fortnite-trick-shot-hidden-t-location/27936/">Search the hidden “T” in the Trick Shot Loading Screen.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most of these challenges will be easiest in Team Rumble, although some can be completed without trying too hard. I suggest going to Team Rumble for the “Eliminations while at 50 Health or less” and “Save yourself from fall damage by landing in a hideout” challenges – just to be safe.</p>
