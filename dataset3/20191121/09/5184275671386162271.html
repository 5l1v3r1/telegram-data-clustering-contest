      <p>Speaking to Bollywood Hungama, Farhad said, “It is better than a parallel hero’s role. It is a very meaty role not done by any other actress in the past. But that does not mean that she will also get to do songs. She will do 2 songs also and will have a substantial part to play as well.”</p>
