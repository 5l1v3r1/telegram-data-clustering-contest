      <p>Other tracks include ‘Shameless,’ ‘Liar,’ ‘Cry For Me’ and ‘Easy’, although the complete track listing is yet to be released.</p>
      <p>She previously said of the album: “I wanted this album to sound like what falling in love feels like, pretty impossible thing to do but I can say I gave it all I had.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never lived as much life as I did writing this album. It was messy and beautiful, unforgettable and at times so painful I wish I could forget. It was excruciatingly consuming and impossible not to get lost in. It was mine… and now it’s yours. I hope you love it as much as I’ve loved living it.”</p>
