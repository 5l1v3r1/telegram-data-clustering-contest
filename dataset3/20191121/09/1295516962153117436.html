      <h1>His Dark Materials: Golden Compass Movie Star Weighs In On New Series</h1>

      <p>Dakota Blue Richards starred as Lyra Belacqua in the 2007 fantasy/adventure film <i>The Golden Compass. </i>The now 25-year-old Richard recently shared her opinion on HBO's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/his-dark-materials/">His Dark Materials</a><i> </i>series as well as Daphne Keen's portrayal of Lyra.</p>
      <p>While appearing on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6kCE4iyT5cIwievxKklfSN?si=7MZZDq9CTs21BzcrpI5_oA">His Darker Materials</a><i> </i>podcast, Richards cited the ages of her version of Lyra and Keen's version as a major difference between the two: "She's 14, I was like 11 or 12, and at that age a couple of years makes a world of difference."</p>

      <p>Richards also mentioned that Keen was already an established actor at the time she was cast in <i>His Dark Materials</i>, as she'd starred in 2017's <a href="https://screenrant.com/wolverine-old-man-logan-death-comic/amp/">Logan</a><i>. </i>On the other hand, <i>The Golden Compass </i>was Richard's film debut.</p>

      <p>"So her approach to it is much more considered, and there's a maturity to her portrayal of Lyra that probably wasn't in mine," Richards said. "[B]ut I think that's because I was younger, but I had no acting experience and I had no sense of the world I was getting myself into."</p>
      <p>Richards has appeared in many other films and television series over the years, including the science fiction film <i>The Quiet Hour </i>and the teen drama series <i>Skins. </i></p>
