      <h4>Where to shop on Black Friday</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Black Friday is on November 29 this year, but you should expect plenty of deals in the build up to the event as well.</p>
      <p>We recommend familiarising yourself with what deals are running at the moment, as this will make it easier to pick out the very best deals during November and Black Friday.</p>
      <p>Big names such as BT and Virgin Media are likely to post offers on broadband packages, while the likes of EE, O2, and Vodafone could have some interesting mobile contracts up for grabs.</p>

      <h4>Best Broadband Deals</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Broadband contracts can be found at incredibly cheap prices in 2019, and you can often pay less than £20 a month for a normal broadband connection. This will be enough for a standard ADSL connection, but at an average of 11Mbps, this isn't very fast by modern standards.</p>
      <p>Still, if you don't want to pay too much, and you're not using many products requiring Wi-Fi in your home, there could be some great deals out there this Black Friday at similar prices.</p>
      <p>Until then, take a look at some of the better deals out there at the moment, as this can help with your decision making during the Black Friday sales.</p>

      </ul>
      <h4>Best Superfast Fibre Deals</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Superfast fibre is currently the most popular form of broadband on the market. Boasting speeds of 36Mbps and up, these are great for larger homes that use a variety of different devices at once.</p>
      <p>There is plenty of choice at the moment as well, with the UK's broadband network constantly improving and thriving in many areas. Some providers such as Virgin or Hyperoptic can be geographically restricted, so you won't always be able to get coverage, but most areas can get some form of superfast broadband at the moment.</p>
      <p>The government is promising a heavy expansion of the broadband network over the next few years, but here's what you can pick up right now.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b6o2">Plusnet: £26/month, 66Mbps, FREE upfront, £75 cashback</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>TV and Broadband Bundle Deals</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Providers such as Virgin Media and Sky love to combine TV and broadband deals in the same bundle. These deals often boast better prices than buying separately, and do make things a lot simpler when you need to consult with your provider or negotiate a new deal.</p>
      <p>Virgin Media is a big advocate for free gifts with its TV and broadband packages, so we recommend waiting it out until you can get some kind of free addition to your package. Right now you can pick up a whole year of Amazon Prime with each of its Big TV packages. These also include your choice of Sky Sports and BT Sport depending on how much you want to pay.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/b6he?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F123001%2F1%2F%3Finline">Virgin TV Bundle: £38/month, 108Mbps, £35 upfront, free Amazon Prime</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Best Mobile Phone Deals</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Mobile phone deals will include monthly contracts, Pay As You Go SIM cards, and everything in between.</p>
      <p>Recent data suggests more people are opting to keep their phones rather than upgrade at the moment, with a majority of <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/news-analysis/122930/exclusive-iphone-owners-not-that-jazzed-about-upgrading">iPhone users not interested</a> in upgrading on the typical two year cycle. Instead, customers are opting to keep their current device for an average of three years or more before investing in another model.</p>
      <p>Still, that isn't going to stop retailers pushing out even more deals in an attempt to entice you into a new contract. To assist with your decision making, we will be suggesting the very best contracts through to the Black Friday sale.</p>
      <h4>What to expect on Black Friday</h4>
      <hr/>
      <p>Outside of Black Friday, providers such as Vodafone and Virgin Media have offered incentives such as free 4K TVs or Amazon Echo speakers. Right now, Virgin is offering a whole month of Amazon Prime in its TV and broadband bundles. This ends on November 13, but similar deals could appear closer to Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p>
      <p>For mobiles, the recent launch of the iPhone 11 will continue to grab a lot of attention, while retailers will continue to drop monthly prices on the Galaxy S10 series as we gear up for an updated device in 2020.</p>
      <p>5G could be a big topic of discussion during the sales, with most UK providers bidding to have some 5G coverage by the end of 2019, this could be the perfect opportunity to get a few more early adopters on board for the advanced networks rolling out across the UK. This means we could see some deals on 5G phones from the likes of Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, and more.</p>
      <p>Three is pledging to build the UK's fastest 5G network, effectively taking away EE's crown as the fastest 4G network. Unlike EE, Three is also promising no prise rises on its SIM cards and applicable contracts. That means if your phone is 5G ready, your Three SIM card could be as well. This is vastly different to EE who offer premium 5G contracts at an increased cost in comparison to the regular 4G SIM cards.</p>
