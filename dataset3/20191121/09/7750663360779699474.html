      <h3>What the papers say</h3>
      <p>Former Tottenham star <b>Gareth Bale</b> will be one of the first targets for Jose Mourinho as he takes over at Spurs, Spain's AS reports. The publication says the Portuguese manager wanted to sign the Wales international from Real Madrid during his time in charge of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a>. However, rival Spanish outlet Marca reports Real have ruled out a January exit. Bale has come in for criticism since celebrating with a flag bearing the words "Wales. Golf. Madrid. In that order" after his country qualified for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is reportedly also eyeing Sporting Lisbon midfielder <b>Bruno Fernandes</b> and Benfica centre-back <b>Ruben Dias</b>, according to The Independent, along with United's <b>Nemanja Matic</b>.</p>
