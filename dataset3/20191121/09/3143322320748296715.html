      <blockquote>“This year we have increased the participants to 60 (15 teams of four) because we have included teams from Swaziland onto the list of participating golf clubs. We have a total of seven golf clubs from the Lowveld and surrounding areas that will be participating in our event.”</blockquote>
      <p>Mariolise Le Roux said that numerous sponsors generously contribute to the success of the day by giving golf shirts, caps, vouchers and hampers to the players.</p>
