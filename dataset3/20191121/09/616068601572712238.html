      <p>As she was fitted for a crisp new uniform in 2017, Amanda Assoun thought her lifelong dream of becoming a Halifax police officer was coming true. But five days later, a one-line note confirmed for her that there was no escaping her last name.</p>
      <p>The Nov. 22 message from Insp. Reid McCoombs to the daughter of Glen Assoun, a man wrongfully convicted of murdering a Halifax woman in 1995, rescinded her job offer.</p>
      <p>The reason, revealed in later correspondence obtained by The Canadian Press, was that she hadn't volunteered information to police about her agreement to post bail and provide housing in Halifax for her mentally ill father, who was living in British Columbia at the time.</p>
      <p>"It was like something had been ripped away from me that I'd worked my entire life for," recalled the 37-year-old Halifax woman, who has since taken her wife's surname and goes by Amanda Huckle.</p>
      <p>Her father's conviction, officially reversed by a court earlier this year, had in the past led to her being taunted by schoolmates and refused apartments by landlords. Now it was scuttling her hope of becoming a police officer.</p>
      <p>Glen Assoun was acquitted of the second-degree murder of Brenda Way on March 1 in Nova Scotia Supreme Court after spending 17 years in federal prison and 52 months on bail. Federal Justice Department lawyer Mark Green had documented that a key witness altered her story about an alleged confession to Halifax police and the RCMP erased potential evidence about an alternative suspect.</p>
      <p>At the time that his daughter was applying to the Halifax police, Assoun — who was released on bail in 2014 — was in the middle of a four-year wait for the federal attorney general to formally declare he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.</p>
      <p>Lawyers with Innocence Canada who represented him say the police force's decision to drop its offer to his daughter is an example of how children of the wrongfully accused also suffer injustice.</p>
      <p>"She was extremely qualified for the job. She hadn't made any secret of her intentions. It is completely appropriate for the adult child of a man wrongly imprisoned for murder to support him as a surety when he gets a chance at freedom," lawyer Philip Campbell said.</p>
      <p>"I was stunned when I heard about it, and heartbroken for both Amanda and her father. It was just cruel, piling one injustice on top of another."</p>
