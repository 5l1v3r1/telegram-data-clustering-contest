      <p>The Green Party has published its manifesto for the 2020 General Election with plans to tax frequent flyers, create energy-efficient homes, decommission North Sea oil rigs and the phase out of the UK’s remaining coal plants and coal mines.</p>

        <li>Remove subsidies to the oil and gas industries.</li>
        <li>Apply a Carbon Tax on all fossil fuel imports and domestic extraction which will rise over a decade, rendering coal, oil and gas financially unviable as cheaper renewable energies rise up to take their place.</li>

        <li>Transform the planning system and building regulations, so that all new buildings built by private developers are built energy efficient standards and to incentivise renovation, extension and improvement of existing buildings, rather than relying on new build</li>
