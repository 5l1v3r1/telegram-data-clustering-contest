      <p>Project Scarlett may end up getting a version of Age Of Empires 4 after all, as Microsoft talk about ‘looking at other ways’ to expand the series.</p>
      <p>Since they weren’t showing off any next gen games, one of the biggest reveals at last week’s X019 event ended up being PC-only title Age Of Empires 4.</p>
      <p>The long-awaited new entry in the real-time strategy series was warmly welcomed by fans but many Xbox owners probably had no idea what it was, as the series has never been on Xbox… but that may not be the case forever.</p>
      <p>The problem is of course that, like any real-time strategy, the game is very difficult to control with a joypad instead of a mouse and keyboard, even though Microsoft’s own <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/02/16/halo-wars-2-review-a-real-good-time-for-strategy-6451727/">Halo Wars</a> series has done well within those limitations.</p>

      <p>‘It’s hard, as a PC game’, Microsoft’s Shannon Loftis told website <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/age-of-empires-4-console-release-hasnt-been-ruled-out/">Stevivor</a>. ‘We want to make it great on PC. But then, I think the whole concept of platform is about to change with Xbox.’</p>

      <p>‘We are working hard to make sure to visualise all the different ways that people are going to want to experience Age [Of Empires]. But our number one priority is to make it work great with keyboard and mouse.’</p>
      <p>The interview then points out that Civilization 6 has just come to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 (which isn’t a real-time strategy game, but never mind) to which Adam Isgreen replied: ‘We’re going to explore our options’.</p>
      <p>‘Once we have our wonderful PC game, then we’ll start looking at other ways that we can show up.’</p>
      <p>There have been console versions of Age Of Empires before, with Age Of Empires 2 appearing on PlayStation 2 in 1999, before Microsoft bought original developer Ensemble Studios. There were also a couple of DS versions of the game, but none worked well given the other limitations of the formats.</p>
      <p>If a console version of Age Of Empires 4 did happen though it would almost certainly be on the next generation Xbox, so horsepower wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
      <p>Although with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/project-xcloud-streaming-service-adds-xbox-game-pass-games-11148301/">Project xCloud</a> on the horizon Microsoft may feel that it makes more sense simply to stream the PC version onto a tablet or smartphone, that already has a control system that’s closer to a keyboard and mouse.</p>
