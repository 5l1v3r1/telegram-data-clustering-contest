      <h1>AIUEC extends support to agitating JNU students</h1>

      <p>All India University Employees Confederation (AIUEC), a conglomerate of labour unions operating in different universities across the country, has condemned the Union government’s efforts to destabilise Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi, and it extended its complete support to the agitating students.</p>
      <p>Addressing a media conference here on Thursday, Mr. M.B. Sajjan, General Secretary of AIUEC, termed the developments in JNU as worse than those seen in the centres of higher education during the Emergency.</p>
      <p>“JNU is a world-class university and has produced great scientists, Nobel laureates and creamy layers in the bureaucratic apparatus. Instead of creating more such centres in the country, the Union government is doing everything to destabilise it. The 300-fold fee hike is one such effort aimed at the closure of the premier institute. The government has resorted to using force to ruthlessly suppress the students’ agitation,” Mr. Sajjan said.</p>
      <p>Linking the “untoward incidents” at JNU with the proposals of Draft National Education Policy – 2019 (DNEP-2019), Mr. Sajjan said it was just the beginning of intensified privatisation of higher education in India.</p>
      <p>“The DNEP-2019 strongly proposes for State withdrawal from higher education leaving the space for private entities. The exorbitant fee hike is meant to drive students towards the private institutions so that the State could withdraw from the sector,” Mr. Sajjan said.</p>
      <p>He asserted that his federation would rope in more organisations and mobilise the student community across the country to build a powerful resistance against the government’s move.</p>
      <p>“We are holding a meeting at Lalit Narayan Mithila University, Darbhanga, Bihar on December 13 to discuss the issue and chalk out the future course of action. We will not allow the government to succeed in its design to destabilise the State-run higher education institutions,” he said.</p>
