      <p>"The song’s kind of, it comes from a place of … it’s about suicide and it’s about not necessarily the act of it itself obviously, but people after it happens, the aftermath of it and people blaming themselves or starting to think, what could I have done to help that person? Or whatever," he said to Zane Lowe on Apple Music’s Beats 1 Radio.</p>
      <p>The musician added: "When I was about five or six I think, my aunt committed suicide and just remember recently speaking to my mum about their feelings, her feelings about going through that sort of rigmarole in your head of, 'What could I have done here? Could I have done anything?' Sort of thing.</p>
