      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-styles/">Harry Styles</a> has once again proved that his talents know no bounds as he was spotted flying through the sky on a zipline while singing for James Corden’s The Late Late Show.</p>
      <p>Ever the performer, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/one-direction/">One Direction</a> star, who only just <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/harry-styles-throws-shade-zayn-malik-thanking-simon-cowell-growing-one-direction-test-tubes-11169548/">gave us a taste of his incredible comedic skills on Saturday Night Live</a>, joined the infamous Gavin &amp; Stacey co-creator in Beverly Hills to shoot scenes for an upcoming episode.</p>
      <p>Dressed in black trousers, a cream jumper, and long black coat, Harry was seen graciously suspended mid-air with beautiful forestry in the background as James tugged at his leg.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a whole host of characters were seen raising their arms in the artist’s legs as they paraded in some questionable attire in the street.</p>

      <p>Eventually, Harry landed back on solid ground again and was photographed showcasing his vocals with his feet firmly on the road.</p>

      <p>This time around though, he was seen wearing a pair of incredible black balloon trousers and black shirt.</p>

      <p>James joined Harry once again but stood directly behind in a bright yellow lycra bodysuit with huge corrugated wings attached to the arms.</p>
      <p>Yep, we have no idea either.</p>

      <p>After the pair had wrapped the scenes, which will no doubt be entertaining, they were captured sharing a little embrace behind-the-scenes.</p>
      <p>Honestly, these two!</p>
      <p>Just yesterday, Watermelon Sugar singer left us seriously impressed (much) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/harry-styles-confesses-love-shania-twain-now-want-collab-11187959/">Harry confessed his love for Shania Twain</a>.</p>
      <p>Without hesitation, the star admitted: ‘I’m like a massive Shania Twain fan that’s probably my most surprise, but it’s not surprising, she’s amazing.’</p>
      <p>What a legend.</p>
