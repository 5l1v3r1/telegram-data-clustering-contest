      <h1>Daniel Levy reportedly went back in for Brendan Rodgers before appointing Jose Mourinho</h1>
      <h2>Harry Redknapp says Daniel Levy wanted Brendan Rodgers back in 2012 as well.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:45:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham targeted Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers before appointing Jose Mourinho, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705673/Jose-Mourinhos-arrival-month-pipeline-Spurs-manager-shock-unfolded.html">according to a report by the Daily Mail.</a></p>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7705673/Jose-Mourinhos-arrival-month-pipeline-Spurs-manager-shock-unfolded.html">claim</a> that Mauricio Pochettino’s departure was in the post for more than a month and Daniel Levy made a play for the former Liverpool boss before settling for Mourinho.</p>
      <p>And former Spurs chief Harry Redknapp says that Levy targeted Rodgers when he was sacked in 2012, but the Northern Irishman clearly knocked the club back on that occasion too.</p>
      <p>As per the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7707845/Harry-Redknapp-reveals-sacked-Daniel-Levy-similar-way-Mauricio-Pochettino.html">Daily Mail</a>, Redknapp said: “When I was getting fired, I heard a few days before because I was told by two very well known football agents that they were talking to Carlo Ancelotti and Brendan Rodgers at the time.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Lurching from Rodgers to Mourinho suggests a lack of joined-up thinking</h3>
      <p>Rodgers and Mourinho might have worked together at Chelsea in the mid-2000s, but what they offer as managers is completely different.</p>
      <p>The Leicester man would have brought swaggering football as well as a lot of positivity about uplifting the club, but not the hard-nosed desire to win trophies Mourinho has.</p>
      <p>Rodgers would likely have been a more long-term option, leaving the club in better health than he found it. To go from that as your first choice to Mourinho suggests Levy has not got a clear idea in his mind of what he wants.</p>
