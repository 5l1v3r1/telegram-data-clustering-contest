      <p>Kapil Sharma’s <i>The Kapil Sharma Show</i> is a hotbed of headlines and the show is constantly in news due to many things happening on, and due to it. While Kapil is known for his jokes on his co-stars on the show, it is his constant remarks about Archana Puran Singh that have bought a severe backlash.</p>
      <p>Kapil has been cracking a lot of jokes on the actress ever since she graced the show as a replacement to Navjot Singh Sidhu. But, the last episode that had the <i>Pagalpanti</i> cast including John Abraham, Anil Kapoor amongst others, did not go well with the viewers of the show.</p>

      <p>His comments on her style statement and laughs were noticed by the netizens and they pointed it out in several tweets.</p>
      <p>While one user wrote, ”Dear @KapilSharmaK9 &amp; Team (@kikusharda, @Krushna_KAS) it’s a humble request please stop making disgusting fun of @apshaha #Archanapuransingh . Give her some respect, she is the Judge, not a character in the show. Comedy is OK. But insulting, demeaning over her physique, not OK.”</p>
      <p>The other wrote, “I feel embarrassed for the audience in #TheKapilSharmaShow – they get humiliated without even realising. There’s fat shaming, the celebrity guests laugh at them. It’s not even funny.”</p>
      <p>Some even called out Archana for not taking a stand for herself and wrote, “Ma’am, The point you are making is absolutely apt. But the greater point is Wo (Archana Puran Singh) khud apne uppar kiye gaye sexist jokes par dahaade maar-maar ke hansti hai aur enjoy karti hai. Use isi baat ke paise laankhon rupye milte hain. Wo bahut khush hai aise jokes se.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile there are no reactions from either Kapil or Archana on the same.</p>
