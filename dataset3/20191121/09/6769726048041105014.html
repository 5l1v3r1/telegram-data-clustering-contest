      <p>A TEAM of East Butler Primary School students have won the best book award in the WA primary school division at the Write a Book in a Day Competition.</p>
      <p>The team of seven Year 5 and 6 students were among 8500 students nationally who took part in the competition <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/north-coast-times/news/east-butler-ps-book-supports-childrens-cancer-research/">earlier this year</a>, which raised more than $475,000 for The Kids’ Cancer Project.</p>
      <p>They planned, wrote and illustrated a book, called Flipped, about an unlikely friendship between sassy hip-hop dancer Becky and introverted game-developer Archie.</p>
      <p>The pair’s lives were ‘flipped’ as they fought to survive the monstrous ‘Ghost-cyclone’ and save their town.</p>
      <p>The students, aged 10 to 12, worked solidly from 8am to 8pm to complete the story for children who were suffering in hospital and raised $1000 in sponsorship.</p>
      <p>Principal Wendy Gallagher said the high-achieving students belonged to a multi-aged academic class (MAC) class led by teacher Bethaney Whitehead,</p>
      <p>“Teaching a class of this type is very challenging and involves being completely planned and ahead of the students as they progress very quickly,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Miss Whitehead has done a brilliant job with the class.</p>
      <p>“We are extremely proud of our wonderful students who have produced a delightful book and deserve all the credit they have received.”</p>
