      <h1>Bank Indonesia: Rate pause, but RRR cut - ANZ</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:24:56+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Analysts at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) offer their quick reaction to the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-idr-rupiah-holds-near-monthly-lows-on-bank-indonesias-status-quo-201911210724">Indonesian monetary policy decision announced</a> earlier this Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“Bank Indonesia (BI) left its 7-day reverse repo rate at 5.00% today, after delivering a cut of 25bps each in its previous four meetings.</p>
      <p>However, it lowered banks’ reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50bps in a move aimed at boosting <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies">liquidity</a> and supporting growth.</p>
      <p>While BI has signalled scope for further policy easing, today’s actions suggest the central bank is keen to use its policy space more cautiously now.</p>
      <p>We maintain our view that the current easing cycle is nearing its end and continue to see just one more 25bp rate cut.”</p>
