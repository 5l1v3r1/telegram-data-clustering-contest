      <h1>Devon has one of longest mental health waits for talking therapies</h1>
      <h2>1,060 patients received treatment within 28 days, but 35 had been waiting more than 90 days</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:12:59+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:12</time> by <a rel="author">Annie Gouk, Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>Devon mental health patients have to endure some of the longest waiting times for treatment in the country.</p>
      <p>New NHS figures on access to talking therapies have revealed some people are having to wait more than three months to get treatment after being referred.</p>
      <p>On average, a typical patient in Devon has to wait 26 days between referral and their first treatment which is twice as long as the national average.</p>
      <p>Nationally, mental health patients usually only have to wait an average of 13 days before accessing talking therapies once they’ve been referred.</p>
      <p>However, that waiting time has been getting worse. Last August, the average wait stood at just 11 days across England as a whole, although the 2018 figure is unavailable for Devon.</p>
      <p>In total, 2,585 adults in Devon were referred to these services in August this year, while 1,880 actually started treatment within the month.</p>
      <p>Of those that started treatment, most - 1,060 patients - received treatment within 28 days, but 35 people had been waiting for more than 90 days.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there were 2,650 people in Devon who were still waiting for treatment at the time the data was collected. Of that number, 250 people had been waiting for more than 90 days.</p>
      <p>Charities say long waits for treatment can have “life-threatening consequences”.</p>
      <p>Geoff Heyes, head of health policy and influencing at mental health charity Mind, said: “No matter where you live, it’s appalling your postcode can dictate how quickly you receive the treatment you need.</p>
      <p>“Too many people still wait far too long to access therapy.</p>
      <p>“While some local variation is to be expected, this data shows that there is a huge difference between some areas.</p>
      <p>“Official guidelines say that nobody should wait longer than 28 days to receive a talking treatment like those provided by these services.</p>
      <p>“Being left without support can have life-threatening consequences.</p>
      <p>“Right now, people are at risk of being rushed through or discharged too soon, which leads to a revolving door situation, with more people entering services when they’re in crisis.</p>
      <p>“Healthcare professionals need the resources and staffing to make sure people get the best possible care, so more people can manage their mental health in the long run.</p>
      <p>“The next government must commit to urgently and dramatically improving mental health services both nationally and locally to ensure that all people get the right care, in the right place, at the right time.”</p>
      <p>Talking therapies are offered to people affected by mental and emotional problems, such as depression and anxiety disorders.</p>
      <p>There are lots of different types of talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), counselling and guided self help, but they all involve working with a trained therapist.</p>
      <p>Of those who completed talking therapy treatment in Devon this August, 52 per cent were said to have recovered.</p>
      <p>That’s the same as the 52 per cent recovery rate seen across England as a whole, and is above NHS targets of 50 per cent.</p>
      <p>Dr Antonis Kousoulis, director at the Mental Health Foundation, said: “The long waiting times for people needing mental health treatment is a cause of concern.</p>
      <p>“It is evident that NHS services are severely overstretched.</p>
      <p>“That is why we need to prioritise taking the demand out of the system by preventing mental health problems before they reach such a level of clinical need and crisis levels. <br/>“We believe that prevention is the best approach to address the current scale of the mental health crisis. <br/>“Treatment is vital, but we can’t only treat our way out of the mental health crisis.”</p>
