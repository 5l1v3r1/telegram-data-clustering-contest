      <p>The Election Commission on Friday took up a <i>suo motu</i> case to probe the incident of Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai allegedly violating the model code of conduct in K.R. Pet Assembly segment on Thursday.</p>
      <p>District Election Officer M.V. Venkatesh, who is also Deputy Commissioner of Mandya, told <i>The Hindu </i>he had instructed taluk election officers to investigate the matter. The official vehicle in which Mr. Bommai was travelling to Mysuru from Bengaluru allegedly refused to stop at two places on the highway on Wednesday for the officials on election duty to check it.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the driver was instructed to stop at Nidaghatta near Maddur first. Since the vehicle did not stop, a message was passed to the personnel at another checkpost at Hanakere.</p>
      <p>There too Mr. Bommai’s car did not halt. The incidents were videographed at both the places and the issue was brought to the notice of the Election Commission, a senior officer said. “The officials concerned at the Election Commission will question the driver of the vehicle,” Mr. Venkatesh said.</p>
