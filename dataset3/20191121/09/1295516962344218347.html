      <p><i>Dragon Ball Super </i>Chapter 53 introduced Seven-Three, a deadly villain with the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-super-deadly-criminal-earth/">ability to copy the powers</a> of others for thirty minutes by grabbing their necks. In his first appearance, Seven-Three nearly killed Piccolo after taking the Namekian's powers. Although Gohan intervened just in time to save his master and friend, the ensuing fight between the half-Saiyan and Seven-Three reveals the villain is even more powerful than he first seemed.</p>

      <p>Without even going Super Saiyan, Gohan thoroughly beats Seven-Three, which isn't surprising. Gohan has been lax about his training since defeating Cell as a boy, but since then, he's stood toe-to-toe with some of the most powerful villains in the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/dragon-ball/">Dragon Ball</a> franchise. Seven-Three is unable to reach Gohan's neck to absorb his powers, and the battle seems all but over when the Z-Fighter prepares to unleash a powerful Kamehameha just as the villain loses the use of Piccolo's abilities.</p>
      <p>As Gohan's Kamehameha surges towards him, Seven-Three reveals his secret ability: He's able to store up to three different stolen powers and actually has access to Moro's energy absorption powers. After consuming the Kamehameha, Piccolo, Kuririn and Jaco attempt to rush Seven-Three as he starts absorbing energy, just as Moro did when he defeated Goku, Vegeta and Buu earlier in the arc.</p>
      <p>Seven-Three easily wards off the three heroes. However, Gohan attempts to attack him from behind. This doesn't work out for the young warrior, as he ends up getting batted away. As this is happening, Seven-Three's allies, Shimorekka and Yunba, radio up to Moro. Moro is annoyed the team has already had to make use of his abilities, which was meant to be a secret, and this means Seven-Three will have to touch his neck again, which he hates. The battle rages on, and Seven-Three continues to pull energy from the remaining Z-Fighters, leaving them drained of it. Shimorekka warns Seven-Three to not absorb too much energy, but the latter assures the former that he's only targeting the four fighters in front of him.</p>

      <p>All seems lost until Piccolo reveals Goku and Vegeta will return more powerful than they were before. This causes Moro to hold off on his attack so that he can absorb even more energy when the two Saiyans return. After the trio ceases their attack, Seven-Three teleports himself along with Shimorekka and Yunba away using his other stored ability, which he used to travel to Earth in the first place. The two leave Earth, promising to return in two months.</p>
      <p>Seven-Three's ability to store powers turns him from a relatively major threat into one almost on par with Moro himself, though the fact he's only able to duplicate an ability for thirty minutes is a big drawback. Still, the villain's continuing ability teleport indicates that he can turn on and off his access to certain powers, which could prove deadly, especially if he gets ahold of the neck of a Super Saiyan.</p>
      <p>Although Moro is certainly the biggest threat in the Dragon Ball universe right now, Seven-Three could wind up really doing some damage if he's allowed to really go all out in the coming battle.</p>
