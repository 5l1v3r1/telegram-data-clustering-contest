      <h1>Two more arrests in Kevin Lunney torture probe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:33:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/press-association/" target="_blank">By Press Association</a></address>
      <p>Gardaí investigating the kidnap and torture of businessman Kevin Lunney have arrested two men.</p>
      <p>The suspects, both aged 38, were detained in the Dublin region.</p>
      <p>In September, Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) director Mr Lunney, 50, was abducted outside his home near Derrylin, Co Fermanagh, and taken to a horsebox across the border, where he was savagely beaten.</p>
      <p>His attackers broke his leg, sliced his fingernails and face with a Stanley knife, carved QIH on his chest, and doused the father of six in bleach.</p>
      <p>The two suspects are being detained at Ballymun and Finglas Garda stations.</p>
      <p>Two men and a woman arrested last week in relation to the attack were later released without charge.</p>
      <p>A convicted criminal considered a key suspect died earlier this month during a police raid in England.</p>
      <p>Known gangster and smuggler Cyril McGuinness suffered a heart attack while Derbyshire Police were searching a house where he was staying in the Buxton area.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney spoke publicly about his ordeal for the first time earlier this month in a powerful TV interview.</p>
      <p>The attack on Mr Lunney, during which his assailants demanded his resignation, was the most serious of a five-year campaign of intimidation targeting the companies and directors that now control the business portfolio that was built up by fallen tycoon Sean Quinn, once Ireland’s richest man.</p>
      <p>A sinister element in the community in the Fermanagh/Cavan border area, where the companies are based, continues to vent anger at the demise of Mr Quinn’s empire.</p>
      <p>The Quinn family has consistently condemned and distanced itself from those attacking the new owners.</p>
      <p>Mr Lunney’s interview has created an intense public and political focus on the intimidation campaign.</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Garda Commissioner Drew Harris and PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne have all met Mr Lunney and his fellow directors in the period since.</p>
