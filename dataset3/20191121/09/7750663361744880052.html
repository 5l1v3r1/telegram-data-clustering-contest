      <p>The Argentine, who spent five years at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a>, was <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/sack-race/news/mauricio-pochettino-sacked-by-tottenham-hotspur_379925.html">sacked by the North London club</a> on Wednesday following a poor start to the 2019-20 campaign.</p>
      <p>It was announced soon after that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a> had <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/tottenham-confirm-jose-mourinho-as-new-manager_379969.html">become the new Spurs boss</a>, with the Portuguese taking his first training session on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>According to <i>AS</i>, Pochettino's removal has piqued the interest of Bayern, who view the manager as a top target.</p>
      <p>Bayern are on the search for a new permanent boss after the club <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/sack-race/news/bayern-munich-sack-niko-kovac-after-frankfurt-humbling_377355.html">dispensed with</a> <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/niko-kovac/"><b>Niko Kovac</b></a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Bundesliga champions have already confirmed that interim coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/hansi-flick/"><b>Hansi Flick</b></a> will <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bayern-munich/news/hansi-flick-to-continue-as-caretaker-bayern-boss-after-dortmund-rout_378521.html">remain in charge</a> at the Allianz Arena until Christmas at least.</p>
