      <p>The Hawks have arrested ten people in four provinces who are believed to be linked to a R600 million toilet scam in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>Colonel Katlego Mogale, said that the arrests were made during intelligence-driven operations in the Eastern Cape, Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Kwazulu Natal by a multi-disciplinary team early Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>She said the operation was the culmination of an investigation into a complaint from National Treasury that the suspects had allegedly colluded to flaunt procurement processes to obtain a massive tender from the Amathole District Municipality for the provision of toilets in the Eastern Cape.</p>
      <p>"The Hawks’ preliminary investigation discovered that over R600 million was to be awarded for the contract, of which R286 million had already be paid to the suspects," Mogale said.</p>
      <p>She said the ten will be appearing in the East London Magistrate’s Court on Friday on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering while moves are also afoot to seize their assets.</p>
      <p>Mogale said the outstanding collaboration with the office of the Director Public Prosecutions in the Eastern Cape made it possible for the case to proceed.</p>
      <p>The Acting National Head of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, Lieutenant General Yolisa Matakata, has applauded the team for the arrests.</p>
