      <p>Ariana Grande couldn’t contain her happiness as Bernie Sanders made a surprise backstage visit to her Sweetener tour.</p>
      <p>The Thank U, Next singer shared two snaps of herself and the Democratic candidate at her latest performance, in Atlanta.</p>
      <p>And the 26-year-old vowed she would ‘never smile this hard again’ after their meeting.</p>
      <p>Alongside the photos, she told her Instagram followers: ‘MY GUY. Thank you Senator Sanders for coming to my show, making my whole night and for all that you stand for !!! @headcountorg and I are doing our best to make you proud.</p>
      <p>‘I’m so proud of my fans for paying attention and getting involved. We adore you!</p>
      <p>‘Also… I will never smile this hard again.’</p>
      <p>Replying to her post, Bernie wrote: ‘Thank you Ariana Grande for not only being a wonderful entertainer, but also for being such an outstanding advocate for social justice.</p>

      <p>Which is something we all now need to hear.</p>

      <p>‘MY FAV AND MY FAV OMG SCREAMING,’ one shouted.</p>
      <p>While another joked: ‘Imagine Bernie just bumping it to Thank You Next and 7 Rings.’</p>
      <p>Ariana has a lot to celebrate at the moment, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/20/lizzo-billie-eilish-taylor-swift-among-stars-leading-grammy-2020-nominations-11188592/">she was nominated for a whopping five Grammys</a> ahead of next year’s awards.</p>
      <p>The Into You singer has been tipped for best solo performance and record of the year for 7 Rings, while Thank U, Next earned her nominations for album of the year and best pop vocal album.</p>
      <p>She was also mentioned in the best pop duo/group performance for Boyfriend, with Social House.</p>
      <p>But Ari faces some stiff competition in the form of Lizzo, Billie Eilish, Lil Nas X and H.E.R.</p>
