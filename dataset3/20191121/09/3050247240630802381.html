      <h1>German Bank Boosts Bitcoin — Negative Interest Rates Hit Every Account</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:27:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:27</time> by <a rel="author">William Suberg</a></address>
      <p>Bitcoin-cautious <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/germany">Germany</a> has seen its first bank demand that ordinary savers pay it to hold their money — even as little as €1.</p>
      <p>According to multiple local press outlets including the <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/minuszinsen-und-jetzt-alle-1.4688103">Süddeutsche Zeitung</a> on Nov. 19, the Volksbank Raiffeisenbank Fürstenfeldbruck (VRF) in Northern Bavaria is now charging 0.5% negative interest rates on the smallest deposits.</p>
      <h3>Bank on negative interest rates: “We had to”</h3>
      <p>“We had to do it,” the publication quoted the bank’s management as saying. </p>
      <p>The reason, they said, was the cost of “parking” money at the European Central Bank (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ecb">ECB</a>). </p>
      <p>In Germany, negative interest rates previously impacted only deposits above €100,000, which constituted an interest-free allowance. VRF’s move makes it the first lender in the country to target savings below that level.</p>
      <p>“Recently, more clients have been coming to us from other banks where they’ve already used up their allowance,” the management continued.</p>
      <h3>Germany could “open floodgates” for banks</h3>
      <p>As Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-in-the-time-of-negative-interest-rates">reported</a>, negative interest rates are beginning to form part of the ECB’s monetary policy. The phenomenon ultimately means that some portion of savers must pay banks to hold their money.</p>
      <p>Critics have warned that such moves would incentivize the public to move into cash, while alternatives such as Bitcoin (<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-price-index">BTC</a>) also stand to benefit. </p>
      <p>By contrast, Bitcoin does not suffer from the inflationary meddling in its supply and associated <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/analyst-plan-b-weak-dollar-can-upend-bitcoin-stock-to-flow-model">destruction of its value</a>, meaning HODLers would never be forced to pay to own it.</p>
      <p>Last month, entrepreneur <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cameron-winklevoss-buy-btc-to-escape-negative-yield-bonds">Cameron Winklevoss</a> noted the cryptocurrency was the ideal method of escaping negative rates on bonds, which account for investments worth $17 trillion. </p>
      <p>Speaking to Süddeutsche Zeitung meanwhile, the CEO of a German consumer portal warned that VRF could “open the floodgates.”</p>
      <p>“We’re seeing a lot of movement on the market at present,” Oliver Maier said. He noted that the ECB’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate for banks to -0.5% from -0.4% was the cause of the upset.</p>
