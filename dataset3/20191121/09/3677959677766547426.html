      <p>On December 14th, 2019, gamers get Christmas just a little bit early as the Razer store will be opening its doors in London! This adds another store to the Razer store line-up.</p>
      <p>The location of this store will be 2 minutes walk from Leicester Square near London's busy theater district, and the ever-trendy Soho making this Razer store extremely accessible to anyone being near the heart of the city.</p>

      <h3>The newest RazerStore is planned to be a gamers paradise!</h3>
      <p>The Store experience has been re-designed by the team at Razer to be entirely focused on gaming and gamers alike. The RazerStore in London has been designed to make the shopping experience more akin to gaming, making the entire experience much more enjoyable overall. They do this by having the lower floor feature more hands-on zones featuring a fully enclosed streaming booth, three multiplayer console stations and a LAN area with 10 separate systems, making this less of a store and more of a gamers paradise! With this amazing area, Razer plans to run everything from weekly tournaments to boot camps to help players hone their skills, Razer is even inviting streamers to stream from the dedicated streamer booth, all equipped with Razer's market-leading broadcast equipment!</p>

      <p>The first floor is more like a conventional store having dedicated displays for their products, like Razers headsets, mice, and mouse mats, in both the fan-favorite Mercury and Quartz suites. Along with dedicated sections for console peripherals, Razer Blade systems, streaming and mobile hardware, and a dedicated section to show off Razer's line of apparel and accessories.</p>
