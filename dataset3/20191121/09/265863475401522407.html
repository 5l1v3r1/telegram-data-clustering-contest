      <h1>Cardi And Nicki Minaj Might Finally Make Up — Under This One Condition</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:30:35+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Dylan Fisher</a></address>
      <p>Things between Cardi B and Nicki Minaj have been on a downhill slope for quite a while now, and there has been no indication that the situation is going to pick up anytime soon.</p>
      <p>That is, until recently. There have been various reports indicating that both stars might be looking to put their differences aside, finally.</p>
      <p>It is not clear what exactly might have prompted this, but it does not seem like most of their fans are too concerned with that particular detail either — for the most part, people are just happy that the two have decided to clear up the air between them.</p>

      <p>However, it seems like there might be a few obstacles in the way of their reunion, more specifically the egos of both stars.</p>
      <p>Cardi B recently made a post on social media in which she noted that she did not want to end the year with any feuds, prompting an unnamed person to apologize to her.</p>

      <p>And while some saw that as an indication that she wants to put their differences in the past, others have been critical of the way Cardi B has chosen to approach this situation, pointing out that she could be the bigger person and apologize herself, because she also had a thing or two to be sorry about.</p>
      <p>However, knowing the way Cardi B has acted in the past, and her generally massive ego, it does not seem like there is any real chance of things improving between these two.</p>

      <p>Fans had many reactions to the post.</p>
      <p>One person had this to say: “I’m not sorry that I always comment on your post and that I think you are amazing. I’m not sorry that I love your music and your style and Sorry, not sorry. 🤣🤣🤣”</p>

      <p>This follower wrote: “I’m sorry for your troubles, and you are forgiven. Love u❤”️</p>
      <p>A social media user shared: “Lol !! YUP! 🗣The power of forgiveness is great! Why is it every time cardi post someone always trying to argue with you about Nicki in the comments? 😭”</p>
      <p>This person stated: “It’s funny to see everyone commenting on you are showing Luv n support &amp; she just did a video before this – 2 post back talking about people commenting and arguing and so on for likes.”</p>
      <p>Nicki seems to be in a more positive space at the moment.</p>
