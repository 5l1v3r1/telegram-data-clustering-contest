      <p>3:45 pm | <b>Budhagali successor nearing installation</b></p>
      <p>The number of people visiting Budhagali Island is increasing by the day as people rush to catch a glimpse of a man believed to be the successor of Dhada Nabamba Budhagali, the fallen oracle of Bujagali Falls.</p>
      <p>The man was first seen last Thursday by fishermen on River Nile who alerted the Baswezi, believed to be the custodians of the Busoga culture.</p>
      <p>Apparently, the person to succeed Nabamba Budhagali must be sighted at this island which until recently has been largely unknown to the public.</p>
      <p>But to be confirmed to the position, he will have to go undergo a number of tests; among them spending eight days on the island without feeding or answering nature’s call.</p>
      <p>Since his sighting, the eight days will elapse on Saturday and he has so far impressed the traditionalists.</p>
      <p>If he goes past this, he will then be subjected to a series of Kiswezi rituals before being unveiled to the public as the 40<sup>th</sup> Budhagali and inevitably head of the over 350 traditional spirits.</p>

      <p>South Africa's elite police on Thursday arrested a senior ruling ANC lawmaker and ex-state security minister for graft, the first such high-profile arrest in recent years.</p>
      <p>Bongani Bongo, 41, a close ally of scandal-tainted former president Jacob Zuma, is accused of offering a bribe to a lawyer who was building the state's case in a 2017 parliamentary inquiry into irregularities at the troubled public power utility Eskom.</p>
      <p>In a statement the National Prosecuting Authority's spokesman Eric Ntabazalila said Bongo had offered the lawyer "an unlawful gratification in the form of a monetary benefit, requesting him to decide on the exact amount required, to stop the enquiry from proceeding".</p>

      <p>Parliament has asked the health state minister for general duties, Sarah Opendi, to explain how the two batches of Life Guard condoms with defects got on the market before being tested.</p>
      <p>This comes after concerns over reports that Marie Stopes Uganda, a health charity organisation, had recalled the two batches 19040205 and 19050105 from the market after users and the National Drug Authority raised a red flag that the condoms had holes. </p>
      <p>The recall comes at a time when condom use is continuously declining from 38% in 2000 to 24% in 2018, according to a report by the Uganda AIDS Commission.</p>
      <p>The report revealed that only 9% of men aged between 40 and 49 used a condom when they engaged in extramarital sex in 2018.</p>

      <p>The recent heavy rains have left the roads in Kasangati town council in a sorry state especially Ngalamye Road. Kasangati mayor Tonny Ssempebwa on Wednesday morning ditched his car and waded through the mud on the road he says was only recently graded and asked residents not to block drainage channels which he says have contributed massively to the problem.</p>

      <p>UHRC boss Haji Med Ssozi Kaggwa started Wednesday with plans to join other children’s rights activists in the country to celebrate the World Children’s Day.</p>
      <p>But Kaggwa was not to make it to the celebrations as he collapsed on his way before he was pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, during a mock exercise in preparation to commemorate the World Children’s Day at his office in Kampala, Kaggwa was reportedly in high spirits and moved to all UHRC departments introducing Mastulla Nassaka, the teenager who had occupied his office for the day as the UHRC chairperson.</p>
      <p>Indeed he was never to sit in his office again.</p>

      <p>“He died of natural causes as opposed to blatant trauma, by shooting or any other possibility. That is what I can say,” Byaruhanga explained.</p>
      <p>Close relatives have since revealed that Kaggwa was suffering from hypertension.</p>
