        <b>Christian Pulisic is a major doubt for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> clash with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> on Saturday as he continues recovery from a hip injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The American could not play in his country’s fixtures against Canada and Cuba over the international break, staying in London instead.</p>
      <p>USA manager Gregg Berhalter said ahead of those matches in the CONCACAF Nations League: ‘Christian is officially at this stage ruled out.</p>
      <p>‘We just got that information. This was a collaborative decision with the club looking after the best interest of the player</p>
      <p>‘These decisions are always difficult because this group and the coaching staff want nothing more than to have Christian here, but it was a risk we weren’t willing to take at this time.’</p>
      <p>Pulisic also tweeted ahead of the Canada clash: ”Good luck to the @USMNT tonight against Canada! Really sad that I’ve had to sit out these important games because of injury but I’ll be supporting from London. Let’s get the W.’</p>

      <p>The 21-year-old was substituted in Chelsea’s last match, the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in the Premier League, which manager Frank Lampard played down at the time.</p>
      <p>‘The only frustration is he comes off with a bit of an injury,’ said Lampard. ‘He was going to be subbed before he scored his goal, he’s got a bit of a hip issue, but I’m hoping it’s not too bad because the way he’s in full flow at the moment is great to see.’</p>
      <p>Pulisic has been in superb form of late for Chelsea, scoring five goals in his last three Premier League games including a memorable hat-trick against Burnley.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/10379440/chelsea-injury-news-pulisic-man-city-rudiger/">Sun</a> are reporting that he will not be available for the trip to the Etihad on Saturday, although Chelsea are yet to confirm this and Lampard may be tempted to risk one of his form players against the champions.</p>
