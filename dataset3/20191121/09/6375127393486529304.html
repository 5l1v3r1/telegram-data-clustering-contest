      <h1>More calls to open bidding for child pneumonia vaccines</h1>

      <h3>CALLS for an open and competitive bidding for child pneumonia vaccines heightened recently as medical experts and lawmakers joined the push for more suppliers to be tapped in the tender.</h3>
      <p>Quezon Rep. Angelina Tan, chair of the House committee on health, said that the call for bidding for pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) should not favor a single supplier.</p>
      <p>“Specifications in biddings should not favor a single brand. Bids should not lean towards certain companies,” stressed Tan, who is also a doctor of medicine.</p>
      <p>The Department of Health (DOH) recently suspended the call for bidding<br/>for PCVs, a move that was lauded by doctors and vaccine experts who noted that the original call for bidding involved a single vaccine<br/>manufacturer.</p>
      <p>The postponement of the bidding is seen opening the possibility of a more competitive tender that will give the Filipinos the power of choice.</p>
      <p>“Medical supplies that are needed by the government pass through Health Technology Assessment, which determines their cost-effectiveness,” Rep. Tan said. “Allowing multiple bidders will allow the government to leverage on the vaccines’ cost-effectiveness.”</p>
      <p>Speaking in the same Kapihan sa Manila Bay held at the Café Adriatico, Health Undersecretary Rolando Enrique Domingo, in turn, noted that the DoH has always been calling for open tenders.</p>
      <p>“But, for PCVs, the specifications were very specific to just one vaccine brand,” Usec. Domingo noted. “Specifications for biddings should be generic so that all brands and suppliers can participate.”</p>
      <p>“The budget for pneumococcal vaccines is P4.9 billion,” Usec. Domingo<br/>shared. “This is why we need to study this very carefully,” he added while noting that they are currently looking at and analyzing new data which considers other viable vaccine brands.</p>
      <p>The World Health Organization (WHO), in a position released in February 2019, reaffirmed its earlier position in 2017 that the two PCVs in the market are equally effective in preventing overall pneumococcal diseases in children.</p>
      <p>The position paper also states that there is at present insufficient evidence of a difference in the net impact of the two available PCVs<br/>on overall disease burden.</p>
      <p>In the same event, Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, president of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines, also shared, “On<br/>pneumococcal vaccines, both PCV10 and PCV13 are available, yes. Ano ba<br/>ang pinakamagandang match? Makakatulong ba ang either of the two? The<br/>answer is yes.”</p>
      <p>Lim also stressed, “Pneumonia is a very common disease in children. Sa<br/>daang-daang bansa sa mundo, kasama tayo sa top 15 na bansa, at yung 15<br/>na yun ay responsible for 75% of deaths from pneumonia.”</p>
      <p>Expressing their support for competitive bids for PCVs, ACT-CIS party<br/>list Rep. Niña Taduran hailed the move of the DoH to defer the bidding.</p>
