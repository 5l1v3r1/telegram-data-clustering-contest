      <h1>Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune available for Newcastle United but Ciaran Clark suffers knock</h1>
      <h2>Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce has Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune back but Ciaran Clark picked up a knock on international duty</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:30:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Florian Lejeune and Fabian Schar are available to play for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> against Aston Villa - but<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ciaran-clark"> Ciaran Clark</a> picked up a knock on international duty and Matt Ritchie remains sidelined.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/florian-lejeune">Lejeune </a>has not played for the Magpies' first team since tearing his anterior cruciate ligament back in April while Schar has been out with a sore knee for a month.</p>
      <p>Newcastle are blessed with plenty of options at centre-back but skipper<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jamaal-lascelles"> Jamaal Lascelles</a> is out until the New Year with a knee injury.</p>
      <p>And with Clark a doubt ahead of the trip to Villa Park, Lejeune and Schar are both in contention to start under the lights on Monday night.</p>
      <p>"Ciaran Clark is our biggest worry after coming on with Ireland. He's got a knock. We ll see how he is. Lejeune and Fab Schar have trained all the past two weeks so they come into reckoning in that respect," Steve Bruce told reporters at his pre-match press conference.</p>
      <p>"Jamaal has a fracture of the tibia so it's going to be a few weeks. Thankfully, his knee ligaments are alright. Yes, he's picked up a nasty injury but it's not as bad as we thought it would be.</p>
      <p>"The big one is Flo because he's been out for so long. He's done everything - played in games, got minutes under his belt on the training ground. Now he's ready to go and the same for Fab Schar, too. As long as they come through the next two - three days unscathed, both come into contention and that can only be a good thing."</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Ritchie, who suffered damaged ankle ligaments against Leicester City in the Carabao Cup in August, is still out after undergoing a minor operation last month.</p>
      <p>"It's still ongoing. He went to see his specialist again yesterday. It's a difficult one because he was so close a couple weeks ago but unfortunately had another setback," Bruce added.</p>
      <p>"He had to see a second opinion. It's difficult and frustrating for him. An awful one when he was very close. He joined in training and had a reaction."</p>
