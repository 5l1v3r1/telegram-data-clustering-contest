      <h1>Barnardos: Docking children's allowance not the way to tackle poor school attendance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:25:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Barnardos says docking parents their children's allowance is not the way to tackle poor school attendance.</p>
      <p>It is after new figures show parents have been issued with legal proceedings by Tusla more than 200 times over the past two years because their children attended school so little.</p>
      <p>Former Minister Denis Naughten says child benefit should be withheld from parents whose children aren't going to class.</p>
      <p>But Suzanne Connolly, the chief executive of the children's charity, disagrees.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn't support that at all," she said.</p>
      <p>"I think that is just added incredible stress to a family.</p>
      <p>"What I would support is that you offer help to a family and you offer help to the parent or the child, having assessed what's needed here.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't do anybody any good to bring a parent to court about this. It doesn't help the child.</p>
      <p>"So what you need to do is say what services do we need to put in place to get his child or children into school."</p>
      <p>Parents and guardians have a legal obligation to ensure their child attends a school or else receives an education elsewhere.</p>
      <p>If Tusla feels a parent is neglecting their kid in this regard, it sends them a warning letter, called a School Attendance Notice.</p>
      <p>These warning letters were issued in connection with 778 individual children between January 2018 and August of this year.</p>
      <p>If a parent ignores one these warnings, they face prosecution and, if convicted, they can be fined and/or jailed for up to a month.</p>
      <p>Tusla has issued court summonses relating to 212 individual children during that period.</p>
