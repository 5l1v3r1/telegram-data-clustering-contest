      <h3>USD/INR Technical Analysis: 10-day EMA keep driving buyers to 72.37/38 supply zone</h3>
      <p>Yet another U-turn from the 10-day EMA, USD/INR takes the bids to 72.00 during Thursday’s Asian session.</p>
      <p>The <b>recovery is also supported by bullish conditions</b> of the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which in turn favors further upside for the price.</p>
      <p>In doing so, highs marked during late-August and mid-November, <b>around 72.37/38 will be the key</b> to watch as a break of which could escalate the currency pair’s run-up to the yearly top close to 72.65 while highlighting December 2018 peak of 72.82 afterward. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-inr-technical-analysis-10-day-ema-keep-driving-buyers-to-7237-38-supply-zone-201911202354">Read more…</a></p>

      <h4>USD/INR: Mildly positive as US-China row confronts Indian government measures</h4>
      <p>With mixed <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> surrounding the US-China deal keeping the USD on the front-foot, USD/INR finds it hard to extend gains <b>following the Indian government measures</b>. Dollar/rupee stays mildly bid while taking rounds to 71.82 ahead of the European session on Thursday.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, the Indian cabinet announced steps to divest five Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) while announcing additional measures, such as a two-year moratorium for telecom companies. Moreover, the  <b>Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) released notifications</b> that could positively affect market investments and solve trading problems. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-inr-mildly-positive-as-us-china-row-confronts-indian-government-measures-201911210436">Read more...</a></p>
