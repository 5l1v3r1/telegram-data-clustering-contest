      <h1>Aamir Liaquat posts heartfelt note for wife on first wedding anniversary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:43:07+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/5607/entertainment-desk/" target="_blank">Entertainment Desk</a></address>
      <p>The internet remained so occupied with arguments surrounding Imran Khan and Nawaz Sharif that it completely forgot about the anniversary of the most beloved couple of the country, Aamir Liaquat and Tuba Aamir.</p>
      <p>The two celebrated their one year of marriage on November 16, 2019 and uploaded pictures with each other on their social media. However, Aamir’s caption stirred several questions as it attempted to mock his critics, but managed to express his admiration for his second wife.</p>

      <p>He started off by thanking Tuba for facing endless criticism with him, during the time of their marriage. He claimed that the criticism was a ‘storm of envy,’ adding sarcastically that it came from ‘virtuous elements of the society,’ who ‘believed in fornication but refused the sunnah’.</p>

      <p>“‎Thanks my love for coming in my life! ‎November 16, 2018 was the day we faced a storm of envy &amp; enmity together, from so called virtuous elements of our society who believed in fornication but refused the Sunnah of the Prophet (PBUH), the Nikah and forget the meaning of <span dir="ltr"> #GharBasana </span> in <span dir="ltr"> #OxfordDictionary </span>.”</p>
      <p>This was followed by Tuba Aamir’s appreciation post, which was not as controversial, but expressed her feelings for her beloved husband.</p>

      <p>The newly found blogger also posted a picture of herself donning a black leather jacket while holding a heart-shaped bouquet of roses. Her caption stated that she had a lovely weekend celebrating both her birthday and her anniversary.</p>

      <p>It is pertinent to mention here that Aamir’s second marriage and his take on his first wife, Bushra, stirred quite a controversy and the host had recently expressed the desire to tie the knot for the third time with Fiza Ali.</p>
