        <i>Earnings should start looking better in next 2-3 quarters, says <b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Vikas-Khemani">Vikas Khemani</a></b>, Founder<b>, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Carnelian-Capital">Carnelian Capital</a> Advisors</b>. Excerpts from an interview with ETNOW.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>Just a fortnight back, we were cribbing about the sentiment and it all seems to have changed overnight. There is a big reform drive. How do you think the market is going to perceive the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/disinvestment">disinvestment</a> candidates from here on or for that matter the other PSUs which very well could be in the pipeline to be privatised?<br/></b>It is a very good move by the government. In fact, I was disappointed when they put this in the Budget, but sooner than later at least they have done it. I think it is a right move both from the perspective of what the government has said. There is no business for government to be in any business and so it is a move in the right direction.</p>
      <p>Also it helps the government manage their finances in the shorter term. Eventually, all those PSUs should be strategically divested. It is a very good move in the right direction. The market is still going to wait and watch how the whole thing pans out. So far, this government has not had any track record of divesting. They announced divestment of IDBI, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Air-India">Air India</a>. They have not been able to do it successfully. The market is likely to wait and watch before re-rating the entire pack. In that sense, disinvestment in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/bharat-petroleum-corporation-ltd/stocks/companyid-11941.cms">BPCL</a>, Concor and three more names would be very critical because there is a very short timeframe. They have to do it in next three-four months. If one of the disinvestment becomes successful, that could lead to reasonably good re-rating of the rest of the pack.</p>
      <p>More importantly, the government also has said that they are willing to go below 51% while remaining in control and that also is an interesting move. Post the backlash after budget, when they started the corporate tax rate cut, one after other, there has been a lot of measures to give impetus to the economy. In that sense, we are in a very good situation and progressively, things should get better.</p>
      <p>As the economic growth comes back, credit supply is back in the economy. We will see corporate earnings coming back and that is the reason the market is probably hypothesising a little bit in advance. That is how <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/markets">markets</a> always do and that is the current context of the market and as long as the government continues to push the reform agenda forward, the markets would continue to respond to it.</p>
      <blockquote>Earnings would pick up when the credit supply resumes in the system. That is one of the biggest problems at this point in time.<br/>-Vikas Khemani</blockquote>
      <p><b>Where do you see the value given the run up that we have already seen over the last few weeks in is BPCL, SCI in anticipation of the government mover? How soon do you see this playing out?<br/></b>The market’s value discovery from strategic perspective would be very different than what markets would be doing from minority shareholders’ perspective. BPCL and Concor are very good franchises. They would be far more valuable if somebody was to replicate that today and which is what the value to on strategic buyer would be. I would say that the runup cannot be fully justified for what could be the right value from strategic divestment perspective and to that extent, we might still have a lot of value on the table. Strategic divestment is not an easy process. These are large value items. It will take next three-four months to have some sort of price discovery and to that extent I would believe that 30-40% value could be still left in most of these names because minority shareholder or market driven price discovery and strategic discovery could be very different.</p>
      <p><b>Markets have gone up earnings have not gone up and are not likely to go up either. Anybody who says that earnings are going to recover, is perhaps in a denial. Where do you think markets will take notice of the fact that liquidity can only take markets to a certain level. Ultimately earnings have to catch up. <br/></b>Earnings have not gone up on a broad-based basis. Of course, there are pockets where earnings are reasonably well placed. We cannot say earnings are not going back. In some sense, a transition is happening. Having said that, I firmly believe that earnings would go up. As normalcy resumes and the credit supply in the economy resumes, you will start seeing a pick up of earnings growth. I am quite sort of optimistic. Markets tend to make this hypothesis in advance and that is the reason markets have gone up. No doubt, liquidity has helped the market to an extent but the market may not capture that part as and when the earnings come because that is already getting priced in.</p>
      <p>Markets move ahead and when the actual event comes, it does not respond as much as it should. That is the nature of the market. I do not believe that earnings would not pick up. Earnings would pick up when the credit supply resumes in the system. That is one of the biggest problems at this point in time. The second risk to watch out for is in the fiscal side. If any one the divestments do not take place, then we would run a big risk out there. These are a few things you have to watch out for but earnings should start looking better in the next two-three quarters.</p>
      <p><b>What is your view on telecom in light of all the recent developments and the fact that we are going to see a hike coming soon?<br/></b>It is again markets have already factored in what is expected to come. We had a long drawn-out stress in the telecom build. I think it is getting addressed and one has to see the balance sheet getting repaired.</p>
      <p>Secondly I think on the revenue side we have to see ARPUs going up. These are two problems and unless both are addressed together, a significant revival can’t be expected. It seems both are getting addressed right now. In my opinion, it is going in the right direction. A fairly large amount of value has been already captured in Bharti.</p>
      <p>In Voda Idea, one has to look at what terms the balance sheet repair happens but Bharti is reasonably richly valued. Directionally, given the stocks are under-owned, given that positive change is happening, there could still be some steam to go. The sector can do well again. It is not only one event that one has to watch out for.</p>
      <p>We have to see if there is a sustainable structural drive for ARPU improvement. ARPUs came down from Rs 300 to Rs 120. We are looking only at 10-20% upmove. That depends on what is the trajectory and markets will really respond accordingly based on the kind of feelers that comes from the players.</p>
      <p><b>We have seen some relief measures for real estate. Would you be looking at construction, cement pockets? <br/></b>The government’s move is very good because a lot of projects had been stuck for last mile funding. That was putting pressure on the entire banking system or because the whole projects were turning NPAs even when requirements were only 5-10% of the total outstanding. So, that was a very <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/strategic-move">strategic move</a> and if this gets implemented with significant pace, those projects could get going. That would also reduce stress in the banking system.</p>
      <p>I remain quite positive on real estate as a segment. we have been very very positive. According to me, good quality real estate developers could see a very very long period of journey ahead. After formation of RERA, there has been a few years of pain, like it happened in case of capital markets. In the next 6, 12, 18 months, good quality developers would become very good investible plays. We remain very positive on real estate as a sector, especially when unorganised to organised is happening.</p>
      <p>Good quality players, people with the sound balance sheet, sound brand and sound execution capability can become a fairly scaled players in the segment because the sector is going to stay, demand is going to stay.</p>
