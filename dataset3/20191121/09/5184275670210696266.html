      <p>This did not go down well with a section of Twitterati. They are criticising Vishal on social media, demanding his removal from the jury panel of “<i>Indian Idol</i>“.</p>
      <p>One social media user wrote: “Dear Vishal, your hate for beloved PM Modi has blindfolded you and resultantly you have become anti Hindu, Hindu Hater so much so that you are unjustifying the Supreme Court judgement of Ram mandir decision. Shame on you. #SackDadlaniFromIndianIdol.”</p>
      <p>Another user called Vishal a “cheap” for passing demeaning remarks on Gogoi.</p>
      <p>After such tweets, #SackDadlaniFromIndianIdol started trending on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Rajan Gogoi was in headlines recently for being a part of the iconic Ayodhya verdict that was long pending. But Gogoi also has some allegations and controversies to his credit with many validating it.</p>
