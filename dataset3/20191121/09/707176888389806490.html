      <p>Royal Mail has warned that its struggling UK business could slump to a loss next year as its transformation was “behind schedule”, sending shares in the postal service plunging on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The company, which this month went to court in a successful bid to prevent staff striking over the critical Christmas period, has been expanding into parcel delivery as the market for letters shrinks further.</p>
      <p>After falling in the first half of its financial year, the group forecast that the volume of letters sent across the UK would drop as much as 9 per cent in the second half of the year.</p>
      <p>“There’s no fundamental change in the core UK letters story,” said Rob Byde, managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald. “It’s whether they can [change] quickly enough to maintain margins.”</p>
      <p>The group’s shares were down 17 per cent in early trading and the worst performer on the FTSE 250 index.</p>
      <p>The gloomy outlook from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9c1b6d6a-056b-11ea-9afa-d9e2401fa7ca">Royal Mail</a> overshadowed an increase in pre-tax profits in the first half, which climbed to £173m from £33m in the same period a year earlier. Overall revenues climbed 5.1 per cent to £5.2bn, led by a strong performance from its parcel business.</p>
      <p>With the rise of online shopping and emails replacing traditional letters, Royal Mail has focused on making the 500-year-old business fit for the digital age by focusing on increasing parcel deliveries.</p>

      <p>“We are on our journey to becoming a parcels company that sends letters from a letters company that sends parcels,” said Rico Back, chief executive, who admitted the group’s transformation was “behind schedule”.</p>
      <p>Royal Mail has been battling tensions with its workers for months and warned of the damaging effects of poor industrial relations. The Communication Workers Union, whose members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of a walkout, called a court ruling last week to thwart the strike an “utter disgrace”.</p>
      <p>“Industrial action, or the threat of it, can only hurt our company, and our colleagues,” the company said on Thursday, adding that productivity losses combined with “revenue and cost headwinds” could result in the UK business making a loss next financial year.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “A heavily unionised workforce is making future cost savings difficult, if not impossible, to deliver.”</p>
      <p>Royal Mail is expecting a lift from the upcoming general election and issuance of postal votes, but that did little to brighten the mood of investors.</p>
