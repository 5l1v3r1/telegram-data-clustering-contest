      <p>The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has vowed to challenge the outcome of last Saturday’s governorship elections in Bayelsa and Kogi States in court.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported that the party held an emergency meeting on Wednesday to deliberate on its loss in Saturday’s governorship elections in the two states.</p>
      <p>The party insisted that the alleged rigging of the governorship elections by the All Progressives Congress (APC) could not stand.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the outcome of the NWC meeting on Wednesday, the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the party has not done a post mortem of the election, it only weighed the circumstances that surrounded the election.</p>
      <p>He said: “We deliberated on the elections in Kogi and Bayelsa States and the highest level of the party lead by the national chairman, will formally address the world.</p>
      <p>“The party has not done a post mortem of the election, we have only weighed the circumstances that surrounded the election. We have also looked at the global condemnation of the elections as held on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“We have reviewed the role of INEC and the role played by security agencies. Formally the party will come up with a position. But whether we have done anything internally within the party, we have not gotten there.</p>
      <p>“Also, we have taken the decision of going to court even long before but beyond that we are going to take other measures which the national chairman will address tomorrow.”</p>
      <p>Olognondiyan also said that the party has no plan to suspend former President Goodluck Jonathan from the party for his alleged romance with the APC during the election.</p>
      <p>Some PDP chieftains in Bayelsa state wanted Jonathan sanctioned for his alleged role in the election. They said the loss of the state after PDP’s dominance for the past 20 years was as a result of Jonathan’s perceived romance with the APC.</p>
      <p>The party chieftains also condemned the hosting of Lyon and other chieftains of the APC by Jonathan at his Yenagoa residence, hours after the declaration of the results heightened the suspicion about the role he played in the defeat of his party.</p>
      <p>However, the PDP spokesman said the former President’s issue did not come up at the meeting.</p>
      <p>He said: “The issue of President Goodluck Jonathan did not come up at this meeting and it was not discussed.</p>
      <p>“You must know about the procedure and processes in our party. If we do not have a report or an issue before us, we cannot delve into it. As we speak now, we do not have any matter concerning President Jonathan before the party”.</p>
