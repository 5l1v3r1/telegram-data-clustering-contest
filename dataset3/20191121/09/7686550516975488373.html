      <h1>Kawasaki disease: Baby's traumatic battle with devastating condition that's becoming increasingly common</h1>
      <h2>Rowan Buckley contracted the potentially fatal Kawasaki disease at just 11 weeks old</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:43:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:43</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Smith</a></address>
      <p>A mum has warned other parents to be on the lookout for a fever, rash and swollen arms and legs in their babies after her son was struck down with potentially fatal Kawasaki disease.</p>
      <p>Kady-Laura Alldis said her 11-week old son Rowan Buckley started deteriorating on Thursday, November 7 and was taken by ambulance to A&amp;E the following Sunday.</p>
      <p>When he failed to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/caesarean-sections-hip-replacements-could-17118694">respond to antibiotics</a> over several days and developed a red rash on his body, he was given a lumbar puncture which identified a serious infection.</p>
      <p>It was eventually discovered that the tot had Kawasaki disease, a condition particularly rare in young babies in which blood vessels throughout the body become inflamed.</p>
      <p>Kady-Laura, from <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/caerphilly">Caerphilly</a> , said: "No-one knows anything about Kawasaki disease and there isn't enough information out there, but it's becoming increasingly common and more children are being diagnosed with it.</p>
      <p>"Although it's more common in under fives, it can affect children of any age. Parents need to know about this."</p>

      <p>Kady-Laura, 23, said Rowan started getting "a bit grumpy" following his immunisations and was sleeping far more than normal.</p>
      <p>"He didn't wake up for his bottles, and he cried when we tried to move him or pick him up to give him cuddles," she added.</p>
      <p>"Then slowly he started not responding to us. His temperature was up and he just wasn't himself."</p>
      <p>When Calpol failed to bring Rowan's temperature down, Kady-Laura and her partner James Buckley called the NHS 111 service for advice.</p>
      <p>After explaining his range of symptoms, an ambulance was called out to take Rowan to the Royal Gwent's emergency department in Newport.</p>
      <p>"I'd never been in the back of an ambulance before, so to see my baby son strapped up on his way to hospital was very emotional for us."</p>

      <p>Kady-Laura, who works as a nursery nurse, said doctors struggled for several days to find out what was wrong with Rowan.</p>
      <p>Then on Monday, November 11, 24 hours after his initial admission, the poorly child started coming out in a rash.</p>
      <p>"We thought he had meningitis, and he was given antibiotics," she added.</p>
      <p>"But he was getting worse as each day passed and they couldn't understand why.</p>
      <p>"His hands and feet were red and swollen, his eyes went red, puffy and very gunky, he had a feeding tube in and went on different machines to keep track of what was going on."</p>

      <p>When Rowan didn't respond to the medication, a lumar puncture was carried out which confirmed that infection was present in his system, although medics could not identify where.</p>
      <p>"He had head scans, heart scans, regular bloods taken and urine samples," added Kady-Laura, who had to take it in turns with partner James to be with Rowan as only one parent was allowed on the ward at a time.</p>
      <p>"His little body got so tired and worn out they could no longer get cannulas through his veins. He ended up having one through a vein in his head.</p>
      <p>"He was so weak and lacking in energy that he could barely cry."</p>

      <p>Thankfully, on the fifth day of being in hospital Rowan was diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.</p>
      <p>The disease causes the blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen, which leads to complications in the heart in a quarter of all cases. If the condition goes untreated, complications can be fatal in about 2-3% of cases.</p>
      <p>"It affects almost every system in the body, but there is no accurate or diagnostic test for it. This makes it difficult and frustrating for parents to fully understand," said Kady-Laura.</p>
      <p>"Many questions are left unanswered because there isn't enough information out there, and medical practitioners have little understanding of it."</p>

      <p>Within two to three days of the diagnosis being confirmed and the appropriate medication administered, Rowan's rash had completely disappeared and he was discharged from hospital on November 18.</p>
      <p>"In the last couple of days he's started to smile again and become his normal self," she added.</p>
      <p>"We still have to give him medication and his heart and kidneys will continue to be examined to ensure he isn't affected long-term.</p>
      <p>"But we were just delighted to come home."</p>

      <p>Kady-Laura heaped praise on staff at the Royal Gwent Hospital for caring for Rowan so well.</p>
      <p>"We are lucky we got him seen when we did. Even as a first-time mum I knew something wasn't right. I trusted my gut."</p>
