      <p>Fisheries Minister D Jayakumar on Thursday alleged that Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu were conspiring to stop the proposed local body elections. Under any circumstances the (ruling) AIADMK would contest and win in the polls, Mr. Jayakumar claimed.</p>
      <p>The senior AIADMK leader urged everyone to accept the good news that the elections would be held. “If you [Opposition parties] have popularity among the people, why don’t you contest? Let the people decide whom they want to see win,” he added.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that indirect elections for the posts of Mayor and Chairperson of urban local bodies were held during the erstwhile DMK regime in 2006.</p>
      <p>Yet again defending <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cabinet-decides-to-revert-to-indirect-poll-for-mayor/article30020747.ece">the government’s decision to conduct indirect polls for Mayor, chairman</a> and other posts in the urban and rural local bodies, the Minister said even the Prime Minister and Chief Ministers were being elected that way.</p>
      <p>During an interaction with reporters here, Mr. Jayakumar pointed out even in indirect elections to these posts, people would make their choice. “Like how the Prime Minister is elected by MPs and how Chief Ministers are elected by MLAs, there is nothing wrong in this,” he said.</p>
