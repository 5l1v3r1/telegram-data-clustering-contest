      <p>The Bristol Live and Bath Live Apprenticeship Awards have now launched and are open to nominations with the highly anticipated awards night following suit in May 2020.</p>
      <p>These <a href="http://bit.ly/33PJh8c">awards </a>are held to not only celebrate the extraordinary apprentices of the region but to also highlight the inspiring organisations and training providers that support them.</p>
      <p>The awards, sponsored by SGS College, are now open for entries and nominations alike and we really want to hear from apprentices who are going above and beyond whilst pushing boundaries within their roles and employers who provide the crucial opportunities for apprentices to grow and thrive.</p>
      <p>One example of such an apprentice is Molly Morris who is in her second year of an apprenticeship with South Gloucestershire Council through SGS College.</p>
      <p>Molly: “I chose to complete an apprenticeship as when I finished my GCSE’s, I wanted to gain more experience and new skills whilst learning on the job. Searching for an apprenticeship, there were lots of different options that helped me decide what I wanted to do.</p>
      <p> “I have learnt many skills in my apprenticeship and in my current role, I have gained a lot of knowledge around ‘Adult Social Care’ and giving advice and guidance to the public and my colleagues.</p>

      <p>“I am currently in my second year of my apprenticeship and I have built a lot of confidence in my work and knowledge. I have also completed training in my workplace which has helped me with knowledge and building confidence.</p>
      <p> “My future plans are to continue to gain knowledge and experience within South Gloucestershire Council and to take on new challenges. I would also like to further progress in my career within the Council.</p>
      <p>“My apprenticeship has given me a lot more confidence and has given me a lot of experience of a working environment and working in a team. It has also given me the opportunity to experience working and have an idea of what I would like to do in the future with my career.</p>
      <p>“During my Level 2, I started in a role which was called ‘Business Support’ and included lots of administration tasks. During my Level 3, I had an interview for another role and I am now currently working in the area of ‘Adult Care’”.</p>
      <p>When talking about the advice that she would pass on to those thinking of enrolling in an apprenticeship scheme, Molly commented: “I would say go for it! Look for a role where you can progress and learn a wide range of knowledge to help you have an idea of what you would like to do and what you are good at. My highlight has been meeting lots of new people, becoming confident in the workplace and helping customers.”</p>
