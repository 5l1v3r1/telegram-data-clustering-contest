      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia’s Immigration Department says it has broken up a China-based online investment scam syndicate with the arrest of 680 suspected Chinese citizens after storming a building where they were operating, but another 100 managed to flee.</p>
      <p>Immigration Director-General Khairul Dzaimee Daud says officers raided the building in Cyberjaya town in central Selangor state on Wednesday after a month of surveillance and caught the scammers in action.</p>
      <p>He says 603 men and 77 women were detained but about 100 others escaped after charging through a security barricade and attacking officers. He says the detainees couldn’t produce their passports but are believed to be Chinese nationals.</p>
      <p>He said Thursday the syndicate has been operating for six months, targeting victims in China with promises of quick returns.</p>
