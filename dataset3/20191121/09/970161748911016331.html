      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">The move comes after the Duke Of York’s interview on Newsnight</a> to discuss his relationship with the convicted sex offender last weekend drew widespread condemnation – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-loses-support-charitable-work-epstein-case-11178029/">leading to many charities reviewing their association with him.</a></p>
      <p>He said in a statement that it was ‘clear’ that the former association had become ‘a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>

      <p>Andrew had been photographed in New York City’s Central park with Epstein in 2010 after the businessman had been convicted for the prostitution of minors.</p>
      <p>Epstein, had been sentenced to 18 months in jail for the crime and was arrested in July of this year on sex trafficking charges. He died in prison awaiting trial.</p>
      <p>The Duke said in the interview that his continued friendship with Epstein following his release from prison nine years ago had ‘let the side down’ for the royal family.</p>
