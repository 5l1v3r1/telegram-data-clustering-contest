      <h1>Local leaders highlight importance of digital skills academy in Bristol</h1>
      <h2>Lloyds Bank Academy offers free, easy to follow courses to help individuals and small businesses</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:03:08+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:03</time> by <a rel="author">Leena Sidat</a></address>
      <p>Representatives from local government, Bristol technology specialists and small businesses gathered at the Engine Shed in Bristol last week to celebrate a digital skills boost in the city, after local people completed the first series of free training events delivered by the Lloyds Bank Academy.</p>
      <p>Hosted by the Academy, the event marked the success of the workshops delivered over the last two months in Bristol. Local people, businesses and charities learned new skills, from how to use email effectively to protecting against online fraud. Courses will start again in the new year and are free for any small business to attend.</p>
      <p>Lloyds Bank launched the initiative in Bristol after research from its latest Consumer Digital Index (CDI) showed that just under half of the people in the south west (47 per cent) are without the essential digital skills they need for work and eight per cent are offline completely.</p>
      <p>Lloyds Banking Group has made the commitment to build the digital skills of individuals and small businesses as part of its plan to help Britain prosper.</p>
      <p>Online safety consultant Angela Loveridge, who runs e-safety training service, Better Together, shared her story at the event after the Academy helped her to boost her understanding of SEO and web analytics.</p>

      <p>Angela said: "The online world is almost like a game of football, it requires a wide range of skills. One person may be good in goal, but not so good at scoring – it’s like me having a background in IT and online safety, but not knowing how to boost my website rankings on Google.</p>
      <p>"With home life and work life both becoming increasingly digital, it’s important for people to have the ability to play across the pitch – with a good understanding of lots of different online tactics. It’s why initiatives like the Lloyds Bank Academy are so vital. The trainers made techy subjects really easy to understand for participants, helping us to plug the gaps in our digital know-how."</p>
      <p>Better Together helps parents and carers to keep their children safe online, and helps seniors to protect themselves against things like fraud.</p>
      <p>Also featuring at the event were other recent attendees of the training, including Tamara Eggleston who runs Barking Hen Jewellery; Justin Paul, a marketing director at technology company Zeetta; and Richard Bate, a board member of the charity Low Carbon Gordano.</p>
      <p>Stephen Noakes, Lloyds Banking Group ambassador for the south west, said: "Digital skills are increasingly important in both the work environment and everyday life. Our CDI research found that workers with digital skills earn on average £12,500 more per year.</p>

      <p>"Money aside though, they help us to keep in touch with friends and family and, for local entrepreneurs like Angela, allow people to find out about your company’s goods and services.</p>
      <p>"With more than 200 digital companies starting up in and around Bristol each year, these skills are only going to become more in-demand for new job opportunities, and will help the city to prosper.</p>
      <p>"It’s been great to see so many people taking advantage of our free training in Bristol over the last few months. We’re committed to helping boost skills in the region by delivering face to face and online coaching to local people."</p>
