      <p>India are all <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/india-vs-bangladesh-2019-20/india-join-pink-ball-party-eye-whitewash-against-struggling-bangladesh-2136200">set to enter the pink-ball Test era</a> when they take on Bangladesh in the second and final match of the series in Kolkata, starting Friday. After long resisting the latest innovation in Test cricket, India will join the party that is aimed at increasing crowds and TV audiences for the longest format of the game. Day-night Tests were successfully introduced in 2015 but it took India a new BCCI regime under former captain <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/sourav-ganguly-very-excited-about-india-vs-bangladesh-day-night-test-2135819">Sourav Ganguly</a> to take the pink ball plunge. Ahead of the ongoing series, Ganguly convinced the Bangladesh Cricket Board to play a Test under floodlights and now he has arranged a grand spectacle at the Eden Gardens. The win in Indore was also India's sixth consecutive Test victory as the hosts equalled their best-ever run in the longest format. India had previously won six consecutive Tests under MS Dhoni in 2013. As far as the <a href="https://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/icc-world-test-championship">ICC World Test Championship</a> is concerned, India sit at the top of the table with 300 points from 6 wins.</p>
