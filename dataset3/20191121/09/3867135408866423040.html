      <p>How ironic after the majority of Washingtonians spoke out in favor of I-976 that our unscrupulous Attorney General Bob Ferguson may be required to defend this initiative in court.</p>
      <p>We all know of his hatred and persecution of Tim Eyman, whether justified or not. And, of course, Ferguson has never met a far-left cause that he doesn’t support, even though he is supposed to be apolitical and represent all the people of this state.</p>
      <p>His disdain for the rule of law and our state and federal constitutions begs the question, “can we really trust Ferguson to defend I-976 in court as vigorously as he pursues far left causes and the Trump administration with his endless law suits?”</p>
      <p>I agree with state Sen. Steve O’Ban: Ferguson cannot be trusted. His track record speaks loud and clear and he should recuse himself from any involvement with the potential lawsuits against I-976. By the way, the local politicians like Dow Constantine and Jenny Durkan and small-town mayors tripping over themselves to file these lawsuits show how out of touch they and the political left in this region are in regard to the will of the people.</p>
      <p>How terrible that I-976 may require our local and state government agencies and Sound Transit to be honest, efficient and accountable in their use of the tax payer’s money!</p>
