      <p>The World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE 2019) convened in the presence of H H Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, Chairperson of Qatar Foundation, yesterday in Doha and is designed to challenge the conventional way of thinking about education.</p>
      <p>This year’s Summit held under the theme ‘UnLearn ReLearn: What it means to be Human’ and is considered to have gathered a record number of participants at Qatar National Convention Centre.</p>
      <p> Dr Armen Sarkissian, President of the Republic of Armenia; H E Sheikha Hind bint Hamad Al Thani, Vice-Chairperson and CEO of Qatar Foundation; a number of Their Excellencies Ministers, dignitaries, policymakers, global education leaders were among over 3,000 participants from more than 110 countries at the opening session of the WISE 2019. </p>
      <p>Minister of Education and Higher Education, H E Dr. Mohammed Abdul Wahed Al Hammadi, in his opening remarks, emphasised that WISE is an important platform where discussions on innovation in education have been taking place at a global level over the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>“WISE gathering is in the international spotlight among those who take a keen interest in discussing education in a holistic manner, and who see education as a core for human development and a tool for the uplift of societies,” said H E Dr. Al Hammadi.  </p>
      <p>Making a reference to the national school curriculum of Qatar, H E the Minister said: “Human development is the cornerstone of Qatar’s National Vision 2030. The values of tolerance, mutual respect, cultural understanding, understanding of the pillars of global citizenship, renunciation of intolerance, violence, terrorism, and commitment to sustainable development have become the foundation of Qatar’s educational curriculum and an integral part of its construction.”</p>
      <p>“The presence of such a large group of policy-makers, thought-leaders, researchers, teachers, and youth sends the message that education is not the responsibility of a particular institution, but a responsibility that we all share because education has an impact on our world and our future as human beings,” he added. </p>
      <p>The discussions and debates at WISE 2019 aim to address several questions including: Should schools teach students how to be happy? Will artificial intelligence make teachers obsolete? Can the latest discoveries in neuroscience make our kids smarter? Do students care about what they are learning? Should schools get rid of grading systems? And Should students pledge a percentage of their future salary to fund their higher education? </p>
      <p>“I don’t have a comprehensive answer to what and how to educate our children. I am here to learn from you; but I would like to add a few points to your discussions today,” said Dr Sarkissian in his special key note address.</p>
      <p> “I believe education should have one important function – to find talent. Every child is born with some talent, and as educators, your job is to nurture it. Secondly, you must remember that not everyone has the same privileges as you – many are deprived of basic rights such as education." </p>
      <p>“So, never forget to share. And finally, I want to tell the youth to believe in themselves,” the President of Armenia added. </p>
      <p>He also lauded the efforts taken by HH Sheikha Moza, Qatar Foundation and Qatar for the global visionary in education. Dr Sarkissian dubbed the Qatar National Library as a ‘Time Gate’ which connects the past and future.</p>
      <p>The opening ceremony saw  HH Sheikha Moza presenting Larry Rosenstock, CEO, High Tech High, with 2019 WISE Prize for Education Laureate. The opening plenary session of WISE 2019 Summit was moderated by Yalda Hakim, Presenter and International Correspondent, BBC World News. </p>
      <p>The opening plenary session featured Max Tegmark, Co-founder, Future of Life Institute; Nicholas A. Christakis, Professor, Yale University; and Najat Vallaud Belkacem, CEO, Global Affairs, IPSOS; Former Minister of Education, France.  Established 10 years ago, more than $28m donations and investments raised by startups have been supported by WISE. </p>
