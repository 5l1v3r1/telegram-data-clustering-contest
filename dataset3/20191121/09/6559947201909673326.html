      <p>In recent years, Amazon has stretched its Black Friday sale across more than a week. Other retailers have also began doing this, with discounts popping up across the whole of November. It is always worth remembering that these discounts can change as the month develops, with the very best deals appearing as close as possible to the actual Black Friday date. This year, that is November 29.</p>
      <p>The differences between retailers could be very minimal when it comes down to the actual Black Friday weekend. A factor worth noting is the length of guarantee provided with your purchase.</p>

This means that any faults that occur are covered by the retailer, who will either repair the set, or provide a completely new one.</p>
