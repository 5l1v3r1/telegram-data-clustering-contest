      <p>TWO pedigree sheep were left with horrific injuries after being attacked by two dogs at a field in Nether Whitacre.</p>
      <p>One of the animals died and the second was put to sleep by a vet. The rest of the flock, which are a mixture of Suffolks and Texels, were left shaken, but uninjured.</p>
      <p>One of the dogs, which is believed to belong to someone in North Warwickshire, was caught at the scene and handed over to police.</p>
      <p>The incident happened in the afternoon of Wednesday, November 13.</p>

      <p>Owner of the sheep, 29-year-old Jonelle Handford, told the Herald: “My partner’s grandparents heard the dogs barking and went out to check on the horses, when she saw the two dogs at the top of the field.</p>
      <p>“One of the sheep was already dead; the other one was still alive but her leg had been lacerated down to the bone, so she had to be put down.</p>
      <p>“We managed to corner one of the dogs and the police unit came to catch it – the other ran off.”</p>

      <p>The second dog is described as being bigger than a collie, dark in colour and bearded.</p>
      <p>Jonelle added: “People need to be vigilant. This may be neglectful or the dogs may genuinely have escaped, but remember it’s not just your own dog’s life you are risking if you let them loose.”</p>
      <p>Carol Cotterill, rural crime officer with Warwickshire Police, said: “Police were called at around 4.25pm on Wednesday, November 13, to a report that two dogs had entered a field and attacked sheep on Birmingham Road, Whitacre Heath.</p>
      <p>“Two sheep sadly died as a result of their injuries.</p>

      <p>“Investigations are presently ongoing to establish the circumstances surrounding this incident.</p>
      <p>“Offences relating to dogs are taken very seriously by Warwickshire Police.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who witnesses an incident of dogs worrying livestock or who has information relating to dogs being dangerously out of control should contact the police on 101 or 999 if an attack or crime is in progress.”</p>
      <p>It is an offence to allow a dog to worry sheep. The National Sheep Association says that worrying includes attacking or chasing sheep and, in some circumstances, farmers are legally entitled to shoot dogs if they are endangering their sheep.</p>
