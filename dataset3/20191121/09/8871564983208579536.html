      <p>An 8-year-old boy from Sipalay City in Negros Occidental is accused of shooting his drunk father dead last night after the man disciplined him for playing with his gun.</p>
      <p>According to the investigator, Corporal Mark Mabayag of the Sipalay City Police Station, 39-year-old victim Jessy Obas arrived at his house at 8pm and allegedly <a href="https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/11/21/boy-8-shoots-father-to-death-in-negros-city/">saw his son</a> playing with his .38-caliber revolver, the <i>Manila Bulletin </i>reports.</p>
      <p>This reportedly made Obas furious, and he allegedly scolded the boy and <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1192678/boy-shoots-dad-to-death-in-negros-occidental">manhandled him</a> in front of his two other siblings, according to <i>The Philippine Daily Inquirer</i>. The boy allegedly became angry at Obas, and shot him three times in the chest.</p>
      <p>The boy is now under the custody of Sipalay City’s social welfare department. The boy’s mother was not in the house when the crime happened because she was working in Manila.</p>
      <p>His father’s body, meanwhile, will be examined by the authorities.</p>
      <p>Sipalay City police said that it was Obas <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/regions/716262/8-year-old-shoots-dad-to-death-in-negros-occidental-police/story/?just_in">who taught the boy</a> how to shoot a gun despite his young age, <i>GMA News </i>reported.</p>
