      <p>Little Lea De Seine can’t be tamed, no matter how much Irina Shayk tried to hold back her two-year-old daughter with Bradley Cooper.</p>
      <p>During a New York City jaunt Lea appeared to attempt to make a run for it down the pavement, forcing model mother Irina to place a hand on her shoulder and hold her hand.</p>
      <p>Nice try, Lea – you can make your bid for freedom next time.</p>
      <p>The duo were lapping up the fresh air in the city when the adorable tot – who was wearing a big, black puffer coat over a cute pink outfit – marched on ahead of her Victoria’s Secret model mum.</p>

      <p>Irina, who was wearing a grey beanie and green coat over tracksuit bottoms with black boots, wasn’t letting go of her daughter, as they then walked along hand in hand after the prison break.</p>

      <p>It was all a bit of fun, as Irina smiled to photographers as they kept on their way, with Irina looking ruddy chuffed with her lot in life.</p>
      <p>Their NYC outing comes after Lea had double Halloween – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/bradley-cooper-twins-daughter-lea-iconic-robin-williams-mrs-doubtfire-costumes-11024882/">dressing up as a Mrs Doubtfire double with dad Bradley,</a> before donning some Minnie Mouse ears for costume number two.</p>

      <p>Bradley, 44, split from his partner Irina earlier this year, following their four-year relationship, with the pair coming to a custody agreement about little Lea.</p>
      <p>It was originally claimed the 33-year-old model was keen to stay in New York, while the actor wanted to move to LA for work.</p>
      <p>However, according to TMZ, they managed to work things out and decided to both stay in the Big Apple, sharing custody.</p>
      <p>The website was told by sources that Irina and Bradley agreed to joint legal and physical custody of their only child, although have decided not to opt for a formal, written custody agreement.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the pair are both apparently open to dating, with a source telling Us Weekly: ‘They want to date, and won’t be shy about meeting people or being set up.</p>
      <p>‘They’re closing a long chapter of their lives, but they’re ready to see what’s next.’</p>
