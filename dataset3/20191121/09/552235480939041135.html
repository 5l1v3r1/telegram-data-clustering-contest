      <h2>Gary MacKenzie knows how influential new Hibs boss Jack Ross can be after working with him during the Buddies Championship-winning season.</h2>

      <p>Veteran St Mirren defender Gary MacKenzie hopes the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> effect takes a little longer to kick in – so they can give his ex-gaffer’s new team a beating when he returns to the Simple Digital Arena.</p>
      <p>MacKenzie was a key part of the squad when Ross turned around Saints’ fortunes, helping them escape relegation before lifting the Championship title the next.</p>
      <p>While he believes Ross will work his magic at struggling <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> , he’s hoping the results won’t turn as quickly as the mood in the camp did at Ralston.</p>
      <p>MacKenzie explained: “The results didn’t come as quickly as the mood in the camp lifted here.</p>
      <p>“The one thing he’ll have them is believing in themselves and that they’re a good side. That will then spill on to the pitch.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“We’re hoping that takes a wee bit longer than next week before they get the benefits of Jack.</p>
      <p>“He’s a good guy and has done really well for this club. Everybody that was here and worked under him wished him well when he left.</p>
      <p>“But we’re there to do a job and he’ll be there to do a job. Any friendship or affection that you have for someone goes out the window.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be there doing everything I can to get three points for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> and he’ll be doing the exact same for Hibs.”</p>
