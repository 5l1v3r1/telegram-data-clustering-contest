      <p>On November 8th, <a href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/liverpool-arsenal-interested-youngster-another-clubs-e15m-offer-rejected/">Transfer Market claimed</a> Arsenal and Liverpool are ‘interested’ in Red Bull Salzburg’s Karim Adeyemi, who is currently plying his trade in the second tier of Austrian football with FC Liefering.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.de/exklusiv-bvb-hat-17-jahrigen-adeyemi-im-fokus-ndash-erste-kontaktaufnahme-erfolgt/view/news/348866">same website</a> this week again relays interest from the Gunners and the Champions League winners and also talks about Barcelona’s failed efforts to sign the 17-year-old.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed the La Liga winners have submitted a €15m offer for the youngster, but it was turned down by Salzburg.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/">Mundo Deportivo</a> journalist Miguel takes a look at claims made by Transfer Market that Salzburg rejected Barcelona’s €15m offer.</p>

      <p>He states sources from the Camp Nou have denied making any offer for Adeyemi, but admit interest in the forward.</p>
      <p>With Barca making it clear via Mundo they have not made an offer for Adeyemi, it could come as an encouragement for Arsenal and Liverpool, if they are keen on signing the young attacker.</p>
      <p>The again, if the offer claims was incorrect then maybe the same is true about interest from England.</p>
      <p>Transfer Market adds Borussia Dortmund are looking at Adeyemi and have already made initial contact with his environment as the Bundesliga side view Adeyemi as Jadon Sancho’s potential successor.</p>
