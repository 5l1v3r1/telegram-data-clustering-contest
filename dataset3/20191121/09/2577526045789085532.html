      <h1>Toyota Is Ending Its Weird Holdout From Racing Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>As one of the biggest car companies in the world, <a href="https://drivetribe.com/p/will-toyota-come-back-to-racing-GUum27oySG-QynuSKFYVkA?iid=C6nIogWvQguspGtyHMCt-g">it was weird when Toyota simply stopped licensing its vehicles to racing video games back in 2017</a>. It was even weirder that the company, despite its size, never actually explained why that decision was made.</p>

      <p>But whatever the actual reasons for Toyota’s absence, it’s over now. Starting with the 98 Supra RZ, Toyota is back with an appearance in <i>Forza Horizon 4</i>:</p>

      <p>A low-key way to announce a return, then, but also fitting given the circumstances Toyota left in the first place.</p>
