      <p>Shah Rukh Khan may have been missing from the big screen for a long time, but he is quite active on social media and keeps sharing something or the other with his fans on Twitter. The actor was last seen in Aanand L Rai’s film Zero co-starring Anushka Sharma and Katrina Kaif, however, the film did not perform well at the box-office. While we wait for him to return on the big screen with a hit, the superstar has been blessing us with glimpses of what he has been up to, on his social media. Shah Rukh Khan recently took to Twitter to congratulate an acid attack victim Anupama, on her marriage, and his post on Twitter is winning a lot of hearts.</p>
