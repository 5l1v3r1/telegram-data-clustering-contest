      <h1>CMC Markets raises targets following profit surge</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:19:41+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:19</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Menin</a></address>
      <p>Online trading platform CMC Markets has reported a jump in net operating income for the first half and raised its full-year target as traders adapted to changes following a regulatory clampdown on high-risk bets. </p>
      <h3>The figures</h3>
      <p>CMC Markets said its net operating income rose 45 per cent for the six months to 30 September, hitting £102.3m.</p>
      <p>This rise was driven by a higher contract for difference (CFD) revenue per active client, which climbed 45 per cent to £2,047 and an 164 per cent increase in stockbroking net revenue.</p>
      <p>Raising its forecasts, the company said it now expects net operating income for the full year to exceed £180m.</p>
      <p>The trading platform's profit before tax surged 318 per cent from £7.2m to £30.1m during the first half.</p>
      <p>CMC reported a 252 per cent increase in earnings per share, which rose from 2.7p to 9.5p, and announced a 2.85 dividend per share. </p>
      <p>The company said its operating expenses rose 13 per cent during the period to £71.2m due to increased investment in its stockbroking business and higher variable remuneration. </p>
      <p>CMC’s shares were up 3.80 per cent at 131p in mid-morning trading.</p>
