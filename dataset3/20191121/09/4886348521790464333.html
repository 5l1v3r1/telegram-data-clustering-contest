      <ul>
        <li>Twitch streamer AndyPyro is banned for seven days.</li>
        <li>Twitch claims that the streamer was seen in “dangerous or distracted operation of a vehicle.”</li>
        <li>The streamer has slammed judgmental viewers and those who didn’t watch the stream.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>On Twitter, Twitch streamer AndyPyro revealed that he has been <a href="https://twitter.com/4ndypyro/status/1196592323364306945">banned from Twitch</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/4ndypyro/status/1196592323364306945">for seven days</a>. In an email, Twitch said that his stream had “dangerous or distracted operation of a vehicle.”</p>
      <p>In the stream, AndyPyro was driving his new BMW. On Twitter, some users say that he was banned for reading his chat while driving. Some have joked that Twitch will ban the streamer for reading the chat while driving but not <a href="https://www.ccn.com/twitch-alinity-attacks-gta-5-cat-animal-abuse-scandal/">Alinity for animal abuse</a>. Several tweets also criticized the streamers for his “dangerous” driving.</p>

      <p>However, AndyPyro says that these users have got it wrong. The streamer says that “if you did not watch the stream, please keep your opinions for yourself.” AndyPyro also explained that “I’ve been driving safely following the laws for 11 years and will continue doing so” and told people to “get off my d–k.”</p>
      <p>Some have suggested that AndyPyro could start talking to Microsoft about moving to Mixer, which is where some other Twitch streamers have gone. Fortnite streamer <a href="https://www.ccn.com/fortnite-ninja-twitch-mixer/">Ninja is on Mixer</a>, as is <a href="https://www.ccn.com/twitch-streamer-shroud-mimics-ninja-announces-move-to-mixer/">FPS legend Shroud</a>. KingGothalion <a href="https://www.ccn.com/popular-twitch-streamer-gothalion-mixer-move/">has just moved to Mixer too</a>.</p>
      <p>AndyPyro has hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitch and it’s unclear if he will move to Mixer. Wherever AndyPyro streams next, his fans are excited to see him stream again.</p>
