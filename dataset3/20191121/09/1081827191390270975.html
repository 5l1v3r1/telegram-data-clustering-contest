      <p>Thanks to our brand partner, Sunsense</p>
      <p>I’m just going to come right out and say it. I’m obsessed with sunscreen.</p>
      <p>Being a beauty editor (for the last 15 years!) means I get to trial all of the SPF lotions, creams and sprays and it’s still one of the most exciting parts of my job. It also means I’m a pretty tough judge.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty of sunscreens out there that will help protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays, but they can be thick, white and hard to apply. And let’s face it – if it doesn’t feel nice you’re not going to use it, right?</p>
      <p>So, let’s take a look at the ones I’ve been playing with lately from SunSense.</p>
      <h3>Sunscreens for the face.</h3>
      <p>I’m most diligent about wearing SPF on my face – every single day, rain hail or shine. So let’s start at the top.</p>
      <p>I recently had a baby and so instead of spending every day inside an office, I’m doing different things throughout the day and as a result I’ve found my suncare needs have changed due to the increased time I’m spending outdoors.</p>
      <p>So it’s already a plus that all of the following sunscreens offer SPF50+ UVA and UVB broad-spectrum protection, and are dermatologically tested and fragrance free.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sunscreen #1: </b>
        <a href="https://www.sunsense.com.au/au/en/our-products/all-products/face/sunsense-daily-face-spf-50.html">
          <b>SunSense Daily Face SPF50+ Invisible Tint Finish.</b>

      </figure>
      <p>I was intrigued by this cream because I really liked the idea of the 'invisible tint'. I decided to try it out on a day I was only going to pilates then doing chores around the house, so I wouldn't be wearing makeup.</p>
      <p>The formula contains moisturising vitamin B3 but is also an oil-free matte finish, which is a lovely balance of moisture without looking shiny.</p>
      <p>As I swiped it over my face and blended it in I could see what they meant by 'invisible' - rather than the tint offering colour it instead just softly blurs little imperfections so my complexion looks a bit more uniform.</p>
      <p>I find that it is perfect for 'off-duty' days and I've since been wearing it over my serum and just filling in my brows.</p>
      <p>

      <p>If the above is a lightweight cream then this face sunscreen almost feels like a lotion-serum hybrid. It's more fluid and more hydrating, offering moisture to my skin while also being SPF50+, broad-spectrum sun protection.</p>
      <p>I decided to test this one as I more traditionally use face sunscreen, which is under makeup. I swiped it on and blended it in, making sure I also paid attention to my neck and chest. I then waited about 20 minutes (I did my hair) before applying makeup.</p>
      <p>It sat perfectly over my foundation and the dewiness of the formula remained. I powdered my t-zone as normal so I still looked glowy but not oily. My powder and bronzer didn't pull, either, when swiped across my face which was great.</p>

      <h3>Sunscreens for the body.</h3>
      <p>While I've always been really good at wearing sunscreen on my face I'm willing to admit I've been a bit more slack with my body.</p>
      <p>But now I'm out and about with the baby most days instead of inside an office, I needed to step up my body SPF sunscreen game.</p>
      <p><b>Sunscreen #1:</b> <b><a href="https://www.sunsense.com.au/au/en/our-products/all-products/body/sunsense-sensitive-spf-50.html">SunSense Sensitive Invisible </a><a href="https://www.sunsense.com.au/au/en/our-products/all-products/body/sunsense-sensitive-spf-50.html">SPF50+</a><a href="https://www.sunsense.com.au/au/en/our-products/all-products/body/sunsense-sensitive-spf-50.html">.</a> </b></p>

        <figcaption>Here's one for those of us with sensitive skin. Image: Supplied.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>I opted to use this one when going about a regular day - a trip to the post office, walking to the shops, hanging out the washing.</p>
      <p>I loved it because it's paediatrician-tested, so it's suitable for babies six months and up. I'm a carrying a boy who'll be at that stage soon, so it's good to know this will help to protect his skin.</p>
      <p>The 'invisible' in the name doesn't lie, either - I really felt like I almost wasn't wearing it, so it's great for when you don't want a greasy sunscreen feeling in that pretty dress or nice top.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It was a no-brainer to reach for this one when I was taking the little guy down to the beach for some fresh air in the early morning or late afternoon. It's ace because it's both sweat and sand resistant.</p>
      <p>I swear less sand stuck to my legs and it was really good to know that even when I got sweaty carting a baby and all the beach paraphernalia down to our spot that I was still highly protected from the UVB and UVA rays.</p>
      <p>

      </figure>
      <p>This is what I call the all-rounder. It's still four hours water resistant like the two others, but it's formulated with the whole family in mind.</p>
      <p>My husband has very different skin and texture preferences to me and yet we both like this one which is great - it means you can chuck one tube in your beach bag and everyone is covered</p>
      <p>It doesn't leave a greasy residue and it's hydrating to my skin, and offers SPF50+ protection.</p>
      <p>All in all, I can happily say these sunscreens pass the tests of my everyday life. The obsession continues!</p>
