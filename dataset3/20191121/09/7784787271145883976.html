      <h3>Gold Coast has now re-signed all three of its 2018 top 10 Picks, with Jack Lukosius joining Izak Rankine and Ben King pledging their commitment to the club.</h3>
      <p>Lukosius, who is originally from South Australia, was speculated to return home but has instead recommitted to the Suns until 2022.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old played 21 games in his debut season mostly in defence, but can play in attack.</p>

      <p>He said he was looking forward to his future as a Sun.</p>
      <p>“Over the off-season I took the opportunity to reflect on my first year at AFL level and that made making the decision an easy one, I’ve loved my time at the club so far,” Lukosius said.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a great group of players, who are all committing to the future of this football club and I can’t wait to be a part of it.</p>
      <p>“The way everyone at the club has made my family and I feel welcome has definitely helped with the transition to becoming a professional footballer in the AFL.</p>
      <p>"The challenge now is to put my head down, continue to work hard on developing my game and ensure I’m ready to play my role for the team on field in 2020."</p>
      <p>Lukosius’ signature is a major boost for the club, who are also expected to welcome top draft prospects Matt Rowell and Noah Anderson up north in 2020.</p>
