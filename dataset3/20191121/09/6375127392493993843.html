      <h1>Crime rate drops in R12 while under martial law</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:18:36+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://journal.com.ph/authors/alfred-p-dalizon" target="_blank">Alfred P. Dalizon</a></address>
      <h3>THERE has been a continuing decline in crime and terrorist-related incidents in the entire SOCCSKSARGEN region over the nearly three years it has been under martial law, Police Regional Office 12 director, Brigadier General Alfred S. Corpus told People’s Tonight yesterday.</h3>
      <p>“The region is now more peaceful and economic-friendly as we are experiencing a continuing decline in crime and terrorist-related incidents since President Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao in 2017” the official said.</p>
      <p>According to Corpus, the region’s crime statistics show a 27.04 percent reduction in the total crime volume compared to the 40.41 percent crime volume prior to the declaration of martial law in the region on November 9, 2017.</p>
      <p>The official said that from May 1 to November 12, 2016, the region’s overall crime rate is 40.41 percent but it went down to 32.64 percent in 2017 followed by 30.06 in 2018 and 27.04 percent from January to date.</p>
      <p>The statistics showed a massive reduction in cases of murder, homicide, rape, physical injury, robbery, theft, carnapping and stealing of motorcycles as well as crimes covered by special laws and ordinances in the region.</p>
      <p>“With or without martial law we will not submit to complacency, instead we will continue in our proactive efforts against all criminal elements and terrorist groups here in SOCCSKSARGEN.  However, there is no denying that the implementation of martial law has helped us in our campaign against terrorism and criminality,” Corpus said.</p>
      <p>“But more than this, I believe that the improved services coming from the intensified police operations we conducted in coordination with the Armed Forces, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and our other partner-agencies as well as the support we are getting from the community are the main factors why we enjoy a peaceful and more secure environment in the entire region,” Corpus said.</p>
