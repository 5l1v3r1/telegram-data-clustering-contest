      <h1>Georgia jails opposition protesters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:50:09+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Irakli METREVELI (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>A court in Georgia on Thursday jailed 10 opposition demonstrators for terms ranging from four to 13 days for "disobeying police orders" during protests which were dispersed with water cannon.</p>
      <p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters this week demanded snap polls after the ruling party in parliament failed to enact promised reforms.</p>
      <p>The 10 defendants had been arrested Monday at a peaceful protest outside parliament.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five more await verdicts later Thursday from the Tbilisi city court.</p>
      <p>In a separate case, the court ordered the pre-trial detention of prominent opposition activist Giorgi Rurua, who is a shareholder of the pro-opposition Mtavari TV channel.</p>
      <p>Rurua has been charged with "illegal possession of firearms" which he accused police of planting in his car.</p>
      <p>He could face up to seven years in prison if convicted.</p>
      <p>Georgia's opposition said the crackdown was an attempt at frightening the protesters by powerful billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, the leader of the majority Georgian Dream party accused of orchestrating the crisis.</p>
      <p>"With these arrests, Ivanishvili tries to sow fear to stop the protest movement, but he gets an opposite result," said MP Nika Melia, a leader of Georgia's main opposition force United National Movement.</p>
      <p>"Popular anger is growing," he told AFP.</p>
      <p>Melia is under house arrest over his role in anti-government protests over the summer.</p>
      <p>Groups of protesters on Thursday symbolically locked the entrances to several government buildings with padlocks -- including the prime minister's office while he was leading a cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p>The protests gripped Tbilisi after ruling party MPs last week voted down legislation to hold parliamentary elections next year under a new proportional voting system.</p>
      <p>Ivanishvili pledged to carry out a "large-scale political reform" following a summer of protests that saw 240 people injured in a police crackdown.</p>
      <p>In the biggest anti-government protest in years, more than 20,000 demonstrators rallied Sunday outside the parliament building and some protesters who attempted to block building entrances were dispersed on Monday.</p>
