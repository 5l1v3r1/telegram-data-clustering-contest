      <h1>Stop using security agents to persecute people, Amnesty Int. caution Buhari</h1>

      <p>Amnesty International Thursday cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari to stop using the security agents and judiciary as a tool for persecuting people.</p>
      <p>The rights group noted that the Buhari is using government agencies, security agents and judiciary, to persecute people “who voice dissenting opinions, challenge abuse and call for accountability.”</p>
      <p>“The flawed charges and sham trials of #Sowore, #Jalingo and #Bakare expose the inadequacies and bizarre manipulation of the #Nigerian criminal justice system and an unacceptable contempt for the rule of law and human rights,” the group added.</p>
      <p>Omoyele Sowore, Olawale Bakare and Agba Jalingo have been in detention since August 2019 for expressing views critical of the government.</p>
      <p>Sowore, a prominent journalist and political activist, and his co-defendant Olawale Bakare have remained in State Security Service custody for over a month despite court order granting them bail and meeting the stringent bail conditions.</p>
      <p>Sowore was specifically charged with seven felony counts, including treason and the “cyberstalking” of Buhari.</p>
      <p>Jalingo, also a journalist, was also granted bail but his bail has been repeatedly and unjustifiably rejected. He faces charges of treason and terrorism and if convicted, he could face up to life in prison or the death penalty.</p>
      <p>Jalingo was arrested from his home in Lagos and was taken to Cross River State after writing a series of articles critical of the Cross River State Government, his home state.</p>
