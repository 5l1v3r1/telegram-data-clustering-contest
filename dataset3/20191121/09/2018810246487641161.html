      <p>For some, it's nice when the hype stays as hype.</p>
      <p>Seeing the world unpack <i>Death Stranding</i> after its release has been fascinating, if only to see what different people get hung up on. For Dunkey, someone that came to prominence for their <i>League of Legends</i> content before branching out into humorous takes on all sorts of games, the mechanics and controls are the biggest problem.</p>
      <p>The best of Dunkey — <i>Breath of the Wild</i> and <i>Metal Gear Solid 5</i> are the perfect examples — is when he's smashing emergent systems together, creating funny moments out of the chaos. <i>Death Stranding</i> isn't built for that, and consequently, the game gets slaughtered.</p>
      <p>There's some slight spoilers towards the end in cut scenes and gameplay, although nothing that would especially ruin the biggest story beats.</p>

      <p>I'm still trying to carve my way through the game. Family emergencies have a way of putting games on the backburner. But I'm totally on-board with a lot of the unskippable animations and cut-scenes. If I tell the game to skip a cut-scene, I want it to skip, not get four more prompts just to get to the bloody end.</p>
