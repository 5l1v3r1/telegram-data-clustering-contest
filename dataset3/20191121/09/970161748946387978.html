      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> has revealed how proud she is of Kylie Jenner, who sold 51% of her Kylie Cosmetics business for $600million (£463million) this week.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/kylie-jenner-sells-cosmetics-company-share-600m-becoming-youngest-self-made-billionaire-11176988/">Kylie has sold the majority stake in her business to beauty giant Coty</a>, which also owns brands including Burberry, Rimmel, Hugo Boss and Max Factor, for the incredible sum.</p>
      <p>The reality star, 39, told Entertainment Tonight how proud she was of her little sister – and how the sale was a long time coming.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘I’m so proud of her. To think in her early 20s, she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/09/kylie-jenner-removes-iconic-lip-fillers-natural-look-fans-7693540/">built a business off of something that she first was insecure about</a> and finding confidence and, you know, just tapping into that and figuring out how to make an amazing product and just being true to herself and doing what she loves to do.</p>

      <p>‘That’s so inspiring and so amazing and I’m so proud of her. I’ve known that selling her business was always in the works for her for a long time.</p>
      <p>‘A lot of companies were bidding and really wanted to buy her brand, and so selling just about half of it was a decision that she made about a year ago and, you know, that she wanted to.’</p>
      <p>Kylie, 22, started her range with lip kits after gaining worldwide attention for her lips, which she later admitted were the result of temporary fillers.</p>

      <p>She had been insecure about her pout, and at first denied that she had been under the needle, telling fans she was just an expert at overlining her lips.</p>
      <p>Fans were so keen to copy her look, they continually crashed her website every times she dropped a new range of lipsticks, and she has since branched out into other products including skincare.</p>
      <p>While she may have sold part of her company, her mother and momager Kris Jenner thinks she will hold on to the remaining share forever.</p>

      <p>Kris explained: ‘Yesterday was a really big day for Kylie and our team at Kylie Cosmetics. Truly a moment for our family to be proud.</p>
      <p>‘It’s kind of a crystallisation of all of our work, but also a moment to just look forward and be really excited about the future.</p>

      <p>‘I think the goal is to just keep building Kylie’s existing beauty business into a global powerhouse brand. That is the vision.</p>

      <p>‘This is her baby and this is her dream … She hasn’t even scratched the surface. She feels like this is where she belongs.</p>
      <p>‘This is where her passion is and she really wants to use her creative side to develop her brand. This is what she wants to do for the rest of her life. She talks about it all the time.</p>
      <p>‘Twenty years from now, she sees herself doing this and maybe passing it down to her daughter.’</p>
