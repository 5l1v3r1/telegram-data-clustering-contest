        <b>The African Development Bank (AfDB) joins a plethora of top banks operating in Africa, insurers and development finance institutions, which are throttling back on investments in coal projects.</b>
      </p>

      <p>Wale Shonibare, AfDB’s acting vice president for energy, said the bank “did not move forward with the Lamu Coal transaction and had no plans to do so in the future”.</p>
      <p>The Abidjan-based lender published an environmental and social impact assessment in May for the Kenyan coal-fired power station in Lamu. The project lies near a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was halted by a local environmental tribunal in June this year.</p>

      <p>According to a court ruling, the Chinese-backed power plant failed to adequately consult the public about the initiative, and cited insufficient and unclear plans for handling and storing toxic coal ash. <a href="https://www.greenbuildingafrica.co.za/kenyan-court-stops-1050-mw-lamu-coal-project/">Read more</a></p>
      <p>The AfDB has been a major funder of coal projects in Africa.</p>
      <p>In the past decade, it has lent more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.65 billion) to South African utility Eskom for its Medupi coal plant and more than 50 million euros for the Sendou coal plant in Senegal.</p>
