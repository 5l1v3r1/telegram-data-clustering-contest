      <h1>Russian Embassy reps visit extradited hacker in holding</h1>
      <h2>After visit: 'We keep in touch with Alexei, his associates, and his lawyers; Efforts made to ensure his legal rights are respected.'</h2>

      <p>Representatives from the Russian Embassy in the United States visited Russian hacker Alexei Burkov in the detention center where he is being held.</p>
      <p>At the end of the visit, they said: "We keep in touch with Alexei, his associates, and his lawyers. Efforts are being made to ensure that his legal rights are respected."</p>
      <p>Burkov was arrested about four years ago at the Ben Gurion Airport, after he was indicted for credit card fraud in the United States.</p>
      <p>According to the indictment, between 2009 and 2013, he ran an underground website that sold data on some 150,000 credit cards, most of them belonging to American citizens.</p>
      <p>According to the Americans, the damage caused by Burkov's actions is estimated at about $20 million.</p>
      <p>Burkov could have been a <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/270043">bargaining chip</a> for Naama Issachar, an Israeli sentenced to prison in Russia for marijuana possession, but it was already decided he would be extradited to the United States.</p>
      <p>His attorney told <i>Galei Tzahal</i> radio, "The Russian application [for extradition] is full of more explanations of his actions than the US sent to Israel. If he goes to Russia he will be prosecuted."</p>
