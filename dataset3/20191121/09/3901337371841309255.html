      <p>SuperSport United’s Aubrey Modiba opened up about how he remained focused after being heavily linked with a move to Mamelodi Sundowns.</p>
      <p>Modiba has been one of many players at SuperSport who have been eyed up by their numbers, Sundowns, although in the previous July/August transfer window, there was a chance that the Brazilians could snap up his signature.</p>

      <p>However, in an exclusive interview with Soccer Laduma this week, Modiba opened up about how he felt after receiving the news about his immediate future.</p>
      <p>“As a player, you feel good knowing that a team like Sundowns and people are recognising your efforts. It makes me feel great, but at the same time I still have a contract with SuperSport and I can’t just pack and leave. There are procedures that need to be followed. When they told me the move was not happening, I told myself, ‘You know what, let me focus more on SuperSport,’” Modiba said.</p>
