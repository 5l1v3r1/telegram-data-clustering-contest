      <p>Right off the back of three number one hits, Carli’s latest release <i>Know You Better</i> is currently riding radio waves nationwide, charted on 5FM and has been crowned a Jacaranda Hot Hit of the Week.</p>
      <p>Musical influencer Carli J’s latest single blends fresh, retro flavoured beats with crossover pop sounds that sizzle with international appeal, adding to its already heady mix of passion, excitement and burning temptations.</p>
      <p>As Carli explains,<b> “</b><i>Know You Better</i> is about falling in and out of love. It’s a journey from the initial sparks that ignite the relationship to all the thrills and temptations along the way to finally becoming somewhat less enchanted and captivated as you get to know someone better.” Carli smilingly adds, “This song is about finding clarity and confidence through the journey and simply enjoying the ride,”.</p>
      <p>Shot in the heart of Johannesburg at Victoria Yards and in Maboneng, the music video captures the rawness and realness of downtown Joburg and casts it against the intensity and elation of falling in love. Male lead Jarryd Nurden and Carli sweep across the sun-setting skyline dancing in silhouettes of sultry abandon as they get to know each other better.</p>
      <p>The dance scenes had Carli revisit her youth as she had to let go and dance like no-one was watching. As she says, “There were many moments during the shoot where the director said to me, we are going to play the song and you just dance and forget we are watching. Letting go of my inhibitions was so much more fun than I imagined, and I ended up throwing my head back and allowing the moments simply to come alive.”</p>
      <p>Written and recorded in Canada, Carli brought the song back to South Africa and has given it an even fuller life with a dream team of talented creatives who shot and produced what she says felt like a “musical piece of video art”. With several edits before the final cut, Carli says its “surreal” to watch and, in her words, “an absolute privilege to have collectively created something the team is now so proud of… we couldn’t be happier with the final product.”</p>
      <p>Carli is so excited for the reaction of audiences to her latest music video for <i>Know You Better</i>.</p>
