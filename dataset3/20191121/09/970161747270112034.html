      <h1>Why is Rachel Riley's Jeremy Corbyn tweet so offensive?</h1>

      <p>Rachel Riley has angered a lot of people with a custom made t-shirt calling the Labour leader a ‘racist endeavour’.</p>
      <p>The Countdown host tweeted a picture of her wearing the top on the night of ITV’s leadership debate as she took a stand against Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The leader of the opposition raised eyebrows and was accused of lying by Jewish Labour Movement national secretary Peter Mason.</p>
      <p>Ms Riley told followers she didn’t feel comfortable knowing her workplace was ‘to be full of racists tonight’, but was met with uproar over her choice of clothing.</p>
      <h3>Why was her tweet so offensive?</h3>

      <p>Printed on the presenters t-shirt is an edited picture of Corbyn being arrested while protesting against apartheid in South Africa in the 1980s.</p>
      <p>The regime was a system of institutionalised segregation between the country’s white minority and non-white majority.</p>
      <p>Black and Asian people weren’t allowed in the same schools, park benches and beaches and weren’t entitled to the same jobs and opportunities.</p>
      <p>So people were more than a little bit upset to see the message on a sign hung around Corbyn’s neck reading ‘Defend the Right to Demonstrate Against Apartheid’ had been erased on the t-shirt.</p>
      <p>Riley was accused of hypocrisy by ‘erasing the historical struggle’ against racial oppression in South Africa in an attempt to fight racism and bigotry.</p>

      <p>One critic on social media said it amounted to ‘putting black history on the chopping block’ to fit her agenda.</p>
      <p>In 1960 South African police killed 69 people in the township of Sharpeville, while hundreds were seriously injured as officers shot people in the back as they fled.</p>
      <p>This sparked mass strikes and dissent across the country and a state of emergency was declared, fuelling racial tensions and making every day life even more difficult for black people.</p>
      <p>Authorities arrested the ANC’s paramilitary wing Nelson Mandela for treason in 1961 and he was sentenced to life in prison for sabotage in 1964.</p>
      <p>Violence continued to plague the country and in 1976 at least 200 black students were killed by police as they protested in the streets of Soweto.</p>

      <p>South Africa faced condemnation and economic sanctions from the international community in the 1980s and Nelson Mandela was released in 1990 as the ANC was un-banned.</p>

      <p>Reflecting on this troubling piece of history, award winning black feminist and LGBTQ activist Chardine Taylor Stone called Ms Riley’s post ‘the most arrogant racist shit I have seen in a while’.</p>
      <p>She added: ‘A blue eyed blonde haired woman literally erasing black struggle to centre themselves as the victim of racism.</p>
      <p>‘You do not treat apartheid as joke to make a statement. I don’t care who is holding the placard or what statement she thinks she is making here.’</p>
      <p>The use of the term ‘racist endeavour’ appears to be a dig at the Labour Party’s internal battling over whether to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>One of its examples of anti-Jewish racism is ‘denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, eg by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour.’</p>
