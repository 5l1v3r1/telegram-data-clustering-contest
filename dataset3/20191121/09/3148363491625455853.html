      <h1>Prince Andrew 'Considering Second Interview' on Jeffrey Epstein to 'Set Things Right'</h1>
      <h2>Prince Andrew is ready to favorably consider a second television interview about his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after his appearance on the BBC was universally slammed, according to a Vanity Fair report.</h2>

      <p>The news of a possible attempt at contritition for his past actions comes just 24-hours after Prince Andrew <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2019/11/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-royal-duties-for-foreseeable-future-over-epstein-links/">said</a> his “former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major distraction” from the charities and organisations he and the Royal Family support.</p>
      <p>It was for that reason he asked the monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, for permission to step back from public duties.</p>
      <p>The Duke of York drew unprecedented criticism by the public and commentators who called his <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-i-have-no-recollection-of-ever-meeting-epstein-victim-who-named-him-in-underage-sex-ring/">interview</a> a PR disaster when it aired on Saturday night, pointing to his lack of clear memory over some events while claiming to know exact times and dates of others.</p>
      <p>Virginia Roberts, one of Epstein’s accusers now known as Virginia Giuffre, for one she had dinner with Prince Andrew, danced with him at a club, and later had sex with him in Belgravia, central London.</p>
      <p>Asked about Giuffre’s accusations, Prince Andrew told BBC’s Maitlis, “I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”</p>

      <p>Many thought he would stay away from the limelight but he is now apparently contemplating another TV appearance, according to a royal source.</p>
      <p><i>Vanity Fair</i> <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2019/11/prince-andrew-another-tv-interview-epstein">said</a> a source told them there were rumours Prince Andrew wanted to “put right the things he didn’t say” despite apparently telling the Queen his initial interview was “a great success”.</p>
      <p>The source said: “Newsnight gave him the chance to show some remorse. He was asked if there was anything else he wanted to say. It was an open goal – he didn’t grasp it, and I think he sees that now.”</p>
      <p>If any second interview does take place, it will defy the prince’s original take on the matter.</p>
      <p>Andrew reportedly told the Queen the interview was “a great success.”</p>
      <p>A friend of the duke told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10365159/prince-andrew-queen-church-success/"><i>Sun</i>:</a>  “The duke went to church with the Queen (on Sunday) and was heard telling her it’s all been a great success.</p>
      <p>“He thinks he’s done the right thing and has put the criticism to rest. He was all smiles and was looking very buoyant and happy.”</p>
