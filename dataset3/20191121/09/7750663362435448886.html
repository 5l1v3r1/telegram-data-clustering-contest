      <h1>Tense opening day sees England reach 241-4 against NZ</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/rory-burns/"><b>Rory Burns</b></a>, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-denly/"><b>Joe Denly</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ben-stokes/"><b>Ben Stokes</b></a> all contributed fifties as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/cricket/england/"><b>England</b></a> followed <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/joe-root/"><b>Joe Root</b></a>'s plea for patience from his top order on an attritional opening day of the first Test against <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/cricket/new-zealand/"><b>New Zealand</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>In a bid to eliminate the collapses of recent years, England captain Root and head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-silverwood/"><b>Chris Silverwood</b></a> are aligned on a more watchful approach from their batsmen.</p>
      <p>But the hard work of the England batsmen was nearly undone on a beautiful sunny day for Mount Maunganui's first Test match.</p>

      <p>After Burns fell for a streaky 52, Root's dismissal for two left England precariously placed on 120 for three before Denly (74) and Stokes (67 not out) steadied the ship in a more adventurous final session, which ended with the tourists 241 for four.</p>
      <p>Stokes benefited from being dropped on 63 near stumps.</p>
      <p>England's run-rate hovered at just above two an over for the majority of the day as New Zealand's bowlers were able to keep their opponents on a tight leash on a somewhat tricky pitch.</p>
      <p>The tourists had three half-century partnerships but none larger than the 83-run union between Denly and Stokes.</p>
      <p>The Bay Oval surface was expected to be batsman-friendly but medium pacer <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/colin-de-grandhomme/"><b>Colin De Grandhomme</b></a> was able to extract a fraction of movement through the air as he claimed two for 28 from 19 industrious overs.</p>

      <p>The all-rounder accounted for openers Burns and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/dom-sibley/"><b>Dom Sibley</b></a>, who made 22 on debut after Root elected to bat first.</p>
      <p>Sibley, while more known for a conservative approach in county circuit, caressed his first delivery through midwicket for four. He then settled into a more familiar pattern of self-denial.</p>
      <p>All of his runs came between long leg and midwicket, perhaps not a surprise given his front-on stance, but an attempted drive to mid-on off De Grandhomme took the edge and was taken by <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ross-taylor/"><b>Ross Taylor</b></a> at first slip.</p>
      <p>He had looked more assured in a 52-run opening stand than Burns, who was spared on 10 by New Zealand's failure to review a caught behind appeal off Trent Boult as Hot Spot detected a faint edge.</p>
      <p>Denly had taken 21 balls to get off nought as England went to lunch on 61 for one but then entered into a brief but fascinating battle with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/neil-wagner/"><b>Neil Wagner</b></a>.</p>

      <p>As New Zealand's left-arm enforcer predictably dragged back his length, Denly pulled him for four fours in the space of two overs. He also conceded a top-edge which bounced just short of gully, before another nick dropped in front of first slip.</p>
      <p>Burns had come to a virtual standstill, though, and was clipped on the helmet as he took evasive action off Wagner before, in the following <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tim-southee/"><b>Tim Southee</b></a> over, squirting an edge between first and second slip.</p>
      <p>Burns escaped again when either Taylor nor <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tom-latham/"><b>Tom Latham</b></a> moved to complete a regulation catch in the slips, and Burns then survived a review for lbw after being rapped on the back pad by Boult, the decision going the way of 'Umpire's Call' on height alone.</p>
      <p>He moved to a fortuitous fifty but was unable to capitalise after groping outside the channel and feathering behind off the metronomic De Grandhomme, who yielded just four runs in his seven-over afternoon spell.</p>
      <p>Root needed 21 deliveries to get off the mark and came back for a second run when <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jeet-raval/"><b>Jeet Raval</b></a> fumbled at mid-on, a misfield that would have unintended consequences for the Yorkshireman. On the next ball, Root fiddled outside off stump and edged Wagner to Southee at second slip.</p>

      <p>At 121 for three at tea, England's diligence was in danger of backfiring, but Denly and Stokes upped the tempo shortly after the former had reached his fifty with a trademark cover drive for four off Wagner.</p>
      <p>Boundaries flowed more freely with the introduction of spinner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mitch-santner/"><b>Mitch Santner</b></a>, who was dispatched back over his head for six by Denly while Stokes tucked into the tiring Wagner before the new ball was taken once due.</p>
      <p>Denly took England beyond 200 but fell straight after when Southee's delivery from wide of the crease took the edge and was pouched by keeper <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/bj-watling/"><b>BJ Watling</b></a>, moving to his right.</p>
      <p>Stokes flayed Boult for four successive fours â€“ although the last of those should have been snaffled by Taylor at first slip, giving England's premier all-rounder a lifeline he could make New Zealand rue on Friday.</p>
