Even Van Helsing, the famed Dracula hunter, has gotten time in the spotlight. Now we’re getting a movie about Renfield, the psychiatric patient who gobbles spiders and flies while pining for his vampire master.</p>
      <p><i>Renfield</i> will be part of the new Universal Monsters renaissance—along with Leigh Whannell’s soon-to-be-released <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/the-new-invisible-mans-updated-premise-is-horrifyingly-grounded"><i>Invisible Man</i></a> and <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/paul-feig-is-working-on-an-original-universal-monsters-movie-called-dark-army">Paul Feig’s in-development <i>Dark Army</i></a>—that’s happening in the wake of <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/01/a-new-invisible-man-film-rises-as-the-dark-universe-dies">the Dark Universe flameout</a>. It’ll be directed by Dexter Fletcher, who made <i>Rocketman</i> and also famously stepped in after Bryan Singer’s departure to complete <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/rocketman-director-dexter-fletcher-robert-kirkman-tackling-universal-monster-movie-renfield-1256272?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">The Hollywood Reporter</a> notes that “this take on the project is described as a comedic, lighthearted approach in the vein of Taika Waititi’s <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/05/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7">vampire mockumentary </a><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/05/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-season-1-episode-7"><i>What We Do in the Shadows</i></a><i>,</i> in which Renfield realises he is in a bad, co-dependent relationship,” an idea that was pitched by <i>The Walking Dead</i> creator Robert Kirkman and scripted by Ryan Ridley <i>(Rick and Morty)</i>.</p>
      <p>That does certainly sound reminiscent of FX’s <i>What We Do in the Shadows</i> TV show, though at the end of season one, it was revealed that loyal vampire familiar/token human Guillermo—who is 100 per cent in a bad, co-dependent relationship with his master—is [spoiler!] actually descended from Van Helsing, something the show will no doubt be exploring in its second season. However, <i>What We Do in the Shadows</i> is genius comedy, and the fact that it’s inspiring other projects (that sound about as far away from <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/06/the-mummyis-monstrous-just-for-all-the-wrong-reasons"><i>The Mummy</i></a> as possible) can only be a good thing.</p>
      <p>We’ll bring you more on <i>Renfield</i>—casting’s gonna be hugely important for this one—when we hear it.</p>
