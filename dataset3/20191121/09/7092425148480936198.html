        <b>Gardai have made two more arrests related to the abduction and torture of Quinn Industrial Holdings executive Kevin Lunney.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This morning, gardai arrested two men, both aged 38, in relation to the abduction on September 17, 2019.</p>
      <p>Both men were arrested in the Dublin region for an offence contrary to Section 73 Criminal Justice Act 2006 and are being detained under Section 50 Criminal Justice Act 2007 at Ballymun &amp; Finglas Garda stations.</p>
      <p>Gardai are not providing any further information at this time.</p>
      <p>Gardai continue to appeal to any person who has any information, 'no matter how insignificant it appears', on this vicious criminal attack or any other criminal activities which have taken place in the Cavan/Fermanagh border area over recent years.</p>
      <p>In an interview with BBC Spotlight last month, Mr Lunney <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/news/kevin-lunney-recalls-excruciating-torture-gang-342262"><b><i>recounted how he was slashed with a knife, doused with bleach and branded by his captors.</i></b></a></p>
      <p>During the shocking attack the 50-year-old had his leg broken in two places, his fingernails sliced down to the quick and the letters QIH carved on his chest.</p>
      <p>Criminals targeting Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) executives are believed to have been behind the attack, which lasted for about two and a half hours.</p>
      <p>Last week, three people arrested in connection with the investigation were released from garda custody without charge.</p>
      <p>The three persons were arrested on Thursday, November 14 in relation to the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>All three, two men and one woman, were released without charge and a file will be prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
