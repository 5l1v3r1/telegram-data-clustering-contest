      <p>Heartbreak is hard. But purging every trace of your ex on social media can be the first step towards healing.</p>
      <p>But what if you look cute in some of your old pics with your ex? One woman has found that deleting is not always the answer.</p>
      <p>Rosie from Singapore decided that instead of removing the old pics, she would simply update the captions to make them more honest.</p>
      <p>After breaking up with her old flames, Rosie never actually deleted any photos of the two of them together, but she archived them, which hid them from her timeline.</p>
      <p>But she decided to add them back, with the updated captions, and a Tweet about her funny swipes at her former loves has now gone viral.</p>

      <p>‘Decided to unarchive all the pictures I had with shitty guys because I look cute but updated the captions to be more accurate,’ she wrote on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She posted three screengrabs from Instagram of her posing in romantic snaps with guys she is no longer seeing.</p>
      <p>In the first pic she is being literally swept off her feet by a boy, as he holds her in his arms at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.</p>
      <p>‘Not a fan of Valentine’s Day but a huge fan of my Valentine,’ reads the original caption.</p>
      <p>But the new edit underneath reads: ‘He broke up with me the next day!’</p>
      <p>The second pic shows her kissing an ex’s cheek: ‘Like if you think I can do better.’</p>
      <p>Underneath she added: ‘Edit: He broke up with me through Facebook messenger so yes, I can do better.’</p>

      <p>The final pic was taken with a beautiful city skyline as the backdrop: ‘</p>
      <p>‘Took a 7 hour bus to Boston to take this picture.’</p>
      <p>The edit reads: ‘Was not worth the trip.’</p>
      <p>Rosie’s tweet has been liked more than 57,000 times and she has even inspired other women to look back over their old pics to do the same.</p>

      <p>One Instagram user edited an old pic that had the original caption: ‘Happy two year anniversary and new year to my love. I’m so excited for our future together, I know we are going to do amazing things! Thank you for making me smile everyday and for all of your support an motivation.’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The edit told a different story: ‘I had to post things like this or else he didn’t believe that I loved him and he would cheat on me because he felt “insecure”. This was the third time I dyed my hair red bc I was desperately seeking attention bc things weren’t OK.’</p>
      <p>Lots of people have praised Rosie for being so honest on social media, where people usually only show off a perfectly curated version of themselves which doesn’t always reflect real life.</p>
      <p>‘You’re an icon,’ said one commenter. Another added: ‘This is a damn smart thing to do.’</p>
      <p>Rosie went on to explain exactly why she edited her captions.</p>
      <p>‘I just wanted to clarify this tweet isn’t about shaming any of the men pictured.</p>
      <p>‘This post is about me, how I moved on by acknowledging my experiences and pain, and knowing that I deserve better. &amp; also that I look good in these pics.</p>
      <p>‘Remember that healing is not always about forgiving and forgetting, and however you choose to heal and move on know that you deserve the world.’</p>
