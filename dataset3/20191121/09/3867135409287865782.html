      <p>I’m writing to oppose the recent proposal from County Executive Dave Somers to transfer oversight of the county jail from the Sheriff’s Office to his own office (“<a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/somers-says-he-isnt-pushing-to-get-jail-under-his-control/">Somers says he isn’t pushing to get jail under his control</a>,” The Herald, Nov 19.)</p>
      <p>An executive is not hired to start taking over offices for himself, especially when it is in direct opposition to the will of the people he was hired to serve. The purpose of county executives is to work with the people the voters have elected to build a strong county.</p>
      <p>The voters were clear in their choice of Adam Fortney that there need to be positive changes to the workings of the Sheriff’s Office. It would be a travesty of justice to undermine the will of the excellent people of Snohomish County by opposing the man and the changes they voted for.</p>
