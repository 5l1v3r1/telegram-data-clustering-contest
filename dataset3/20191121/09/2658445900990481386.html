      <p>Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has charged leaders of religious bodies in the country, particularly Lagos to remain peaceful and tolerant of one another inspite of religious and tribal differences.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu gave the charge on Thursday in his address to mark the “Year 2019 International Day for Tolerance,” with the theme: “Enhancing Harmonious Relationship and Peace among religious bodies for better socio-economic development in the state,” which held in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos.</p>
      <p>The event was attended by wife of Deputy Governor, Mrs Oluremi Hamzat who represented the governor and his wife and various religious leaders, such as Rev. Dr. Kehinde Babarinde, President Lagos Baptist Conference, who was also a Lecturer on the occasion, Sheik Abdul-Rahman Ahmad, Chief Missioner, Ansar-ud-Deen Society of Nigeria, among others.</p>
      <p>The governor said the call became necessary in view of the era of rising and violent extremism and widening conflicts that are characterized by a fundamental disregard for human life.</p>
      <p>Saying it is however gratifying that despite Lagos being the most cosmopolitan state that houses every tribe and religion in Nigeria, it has remained a peaceful and tolerant state in terms of religion and tribal sentiments.</p>
      <p>“This has helped our economy and invariably our socio-economic development…much as we are not taking this for granted, we have continued to create more enabling environment for more interactions among all religions in Lagos state.</p>
      <p>According to Sanwo-Olu, tolerance is neither indulgence nor indifference, “rather it is the respect and appreciation of the rich variety of our world cultures, our forms of expression and ways of being human; it is a conscious act of showing respect for other beliefs, culture and ways of life as long as it does not affect the basic right of others”.</p>
      <p>The governor urged the discussants to rub minds together on some deeper ramifications of the nation’s unity, “let us be proud of our cultural diversity and our great accomplishment even in civilization”.</p>
      <p>Assuring that many will leave after the discussions and presentations with conviction of how to live in peace and harmony with one another so as to leave a better society for the unborn children.</p>
      <p>In her welcome address earlier, Lagos Commissioner for Home Affairs, Mrs. Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf charged Lagosians to imbibe the spirit of tolerance and togetherness.</p>

      <p>According to her, tolerance was the only weapon of building peace and combating intolerance in form of racism and discrimination that too often tore societies apart, adding that the government was leaving nothing to chance to sustain and maintain the peaceful co-existence of all Lagosians.</p>
      <p>“The government is adequately mobilising the security agents and spending so much on education and enlightenment of the citizen. People should become aware of the link between their behaviour and vicious circle of mistrust and violence in the society.</p>
      <p>“The peaceful development being witnessed in Lagos State presently is not by accident. It is due to our tolerance. I hereby implore you all to continue to join hands together with government of Lagos State to promote tolerance for our socio-economic development,” she said.</p>
      <p>Students from various schools in the state also gave brief talk on tolerance calling for peaceful co-existence among all and sundry.</p>
