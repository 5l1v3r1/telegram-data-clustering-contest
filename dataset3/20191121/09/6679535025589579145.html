      <p>Former Member of Parliament of Parvatipuram D.V.G. Sankara Rao, a nature lover, developed a wonderful roof garden at home located at Kamakshi Nagar in Vizianagaram to create awareness among the people about the benefits of natural farming.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sankara Rao, who now works as anaesthesiologist at Maharaja Institute of Medical Sciences at Nellimarla in the district, says that people make use of the space in their homes to beat rising pollution and temperature.</p>
      <p>“Growing vegetables, flowers and fruits ensures physical and mental well-being. Initially, it may come off as a tough job, but one gains confidence when one sees the plants grow,” Dr. Sankara Rao added, who is also a writer.</p>
      <p>He won the first prize for his story ‘Bahumati’ at a State-level competition organised by Manchupalli Satyavati Devi Foundation.“It’s when I am here that I ruminate on issues and get story ideas,” he said, adding that spending time with Nature will be a soulful experience for anyone.</p>
      <p>Various fruits and vegetables that are grown at his place include coconut, mango, guava, sapota, orange, tomato, pumpkin, eggplant, bitter gourd and others.</p>
      <p>Dr. Sankara Rao, who represented Parvatipuram Parliament seat between 1999 and 2004, said he campaigned about zero based natural farming in his constituency and enlightened the people about the harmful effects of extensive usage of fertilizers and pesticides.</p>
