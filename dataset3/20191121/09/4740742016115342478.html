      <h1>Radio Presenter of 25 years, Paris Troy set to host and inspire at the Bristol Gold Star Awards</h1>
      <h2>The Bristol Gold Star Awards will take place on 10 December</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:00:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Olivia Rose Fox</a></address>
      <p>Radio Presenter, Event Host, Group Fitness Instructor and Mentor are just some of the strings to Paris Troy’s bow.</p>
      <p>Whilst he is evidently a man of many talents, Paris is also known for his continued dedication to supporting charitable causes, most recently taking part in the ‘Jail and Bail Bristol 2019’ in order to raise vital funds for the Children’s Hospice South West.</p>
      <p>Now set to host the 2019 Bristol Gold Star Awards, Paris will be there on 10 December to award the winners and to crown the overall ‘Gold Star Hero’.</p>
      <p>This coveted title is still up for decision via a public poll which is open for just four more days. To cast your vote, visit the poll below and view a summary of the individual category winners <a href="http://bit.ly/2pa8o6N">here</a>.</p>
      <p>With regards to the upcoming awards, Paris commented: “I am a freelance radio presenter having worked for GWR and HEART Radio for 25 years.</p>
      <p>“I'm also an event host and compère, a fully qualified fitness instructor with a particular emphasis on bringing physical and mental well being to workplaces, and a group leader for Evolution Business Networking.</p>
      <p>“I'm also involved in motivational speaking, workshops and teaching/mentoring in schools, colleges and workplaces.</p>
      <p>“I'm extremely proud and honoured to be hosting the Bristol Post Gold Star awards. I've attended as a guest in the past and I love the celebration of everything that is great about the human spirit and body!</p>
      <p>“The stories of courage, kindness, and dedication from everyday, selfless people  are truly exceptional, heartwarming and deserve all of the recognition.</p>
      <p>“These awards give us perspective and remind us that we can always do better, even in small ways!”</p>
      <p>This is now the 25th consecutive year that these awards have been held for local heroes, meaning that this is the longest running awards of their kind in the South West.</p>
      <p>The aim of the awards is simple: To celebrate those who have achieved extraordinary things. Some have saved lives, some have cared for others, some have raised huge amounts for charity or have made a real difference to their communities. Others have faced adversity or illness with great courage and decorum.</p>
      <p>With less than three weeks to go until the event of the season, It is now approaching the last chance to get tickets, so it’s time to clear your diary for the day and get your glad rags ready to join us and a fantastic community of inspirational individuals on Tuesday 10 December for a night to remember at The Bristol Hotel.</p>
