      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Growth in palm oil production will be slow for the next few years, helping reduce stockpiles and boost prices, leading industry analyst James Fry said on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Dry weather and lower fertiliser use - a move adopted by some growers to save costs - have affected output this year at top producers Indonesia and Malaysia, and will continue to be a factor in the coming years, Fry said at an industry conference.</p>
      <p>Indonesia's production this year may prove to be little changed from last year, while Malaysia will see some growth, Fry said.</p>
      <p>Fry is the chairman of consultancy LMC International and his forecasts are closely watched in the palm oil industry. (Reporting by A. Ananthalakshmi; Editing by Jon Boyle)</p>
