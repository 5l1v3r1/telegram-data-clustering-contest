      <p>With two of Kwa Zulu-Natal based outfits, Maritburg United and Golden Arrows, in the semi finals of the Telkom Knockout how Moses Mabhida was chosen as the venue for the final?<br/><br/>What happened to a neautral venue clause? No one follows the rules in the PSL. The PSL has been using neautral venues as final venues. Perhaps the league doesn't see the two Durban based clubs progressing to the final. A Kaizer Chiefs versus Mamelodi Sundowns is a sponsors final but there are other teams in the semis. There are more questions than answers in South African football.<br/><br/>No one can really say knows what the rules are in the league. Rules change almost everytime someone's moods swings. There is no stability and consistency in our football. The league is always found wanting when questioned. Someone has to tell us what is really special about Mabhida.<br/><br/>We have world cup stadiums in the country but Mabhida is always prefered over them. With South Africa consisting of nine provinces, every province, should at least hosts one final after two seasons. Every cup final is taken to the port city. There is nothing neautral about Mabhida this time around.<br/><br/>The PSL has face its DC for bringing the league into disrepute. They can't set rules for others to follow and they just disregard them. Rules are rules and everyone must respect them. Perhaps the league can provide us with reasons why Mabhida is the prefered stadium in the country.<br/><br/>With most finals being played down in Durban let every decider go there. It is always Mabhida that hosts finals and should be known when the new season starts that all finals will be played there. We can't always wait for the old but new announcement that the final is going to Durban.<br/><br/>Moses Mabhida should be declared a South African Wembly.  </p>
