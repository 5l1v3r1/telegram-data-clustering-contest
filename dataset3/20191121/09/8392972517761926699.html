      <p>The Duke of York <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-let-side-down-over-friendship-with-paedophile/">Prince Andrew</a> has announced he is stepping back from royal duties for the "foreseeable future".</p>
      <p>The royal confirmed on Wednesday night (20.11.19) he will stop his duties because of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-andrew-is-reportedly-wants-a-second-interview/">the Jeffrey Epstein scandal</a>, as he thinks it caused "major disruption to his family's work" and "the valuable work" at the various organisations and charities he supports.</p>

      <p>He said in a statement: "It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.</p>
      <p>"Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <aside>I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future.</aside>
      <p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure.</p>
      <p>"I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency."</p>

      <p>The Duke of York's decision follows his high-profile interview with BBC Newsnight, broadcast over the weekend, in which he talked about his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>BT is the latest business to sever ties with the duke, following in the footsteps of KPMG and Standard Chartered Bank, both of which said they were withdrawing their support for Andrew's Pitch@Palace initiative, which focuses on business mentoring.</p>
