        <b>An Indian couple accused of spying on Sikh and Kashmiri communities in Germany went on trial Thursday on charges that carry a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The suspects were charged in March and have been named only as Manmohan S., 50, and his wife Kanwal Jit K., 51, in keeping with German privacy rules for defendants.</p>
      <p>Their trial was being held in a court in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>"Manmohan S. agreed... to provide information about Germany's Sikh community and Kashmir movement and their relatives to an employee of the Indian foreign intelligence service Research &amp; Analysis Wing," prosecutors said in a statement earlier this year.</p>
      <p>His wife joined him in monthly meetings with the Indian intelligence officer between July and December 2017, and in total the couple were paid â‚¬7,200.</p>
      <p>Sikhs in Germany number between 10,000 and 20,000 -- their third biggest community in Europe after Britain and Italy, according to the religious rights group REMID.</p>
