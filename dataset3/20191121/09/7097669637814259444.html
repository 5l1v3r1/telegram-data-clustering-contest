      <h1>Iran's Guards praise 'timely' action against protesters</h1>

      <p>Tehran (AFP) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards on Thursday praised the armed forces for taking "timely" action against "rioters" and said calm had returned after days of unrest sparked by a hike in petrol prices.</p>
      <p>The protests erupted across the sanctions-hit country on November 15, hours after the price of petrol was raised by as much as 200 percent.</p>
      <p>Motorists blocked highways in Tehran before the unrest spread to cities and towns across the country, with petrol pumps torched, police stations attacked and shops looted.</p>
      <p>"Incidents, big and small, caused by the rise in petrol price took place in (a little) less than 100 cities across Iran," said a statement on the Guards' official website Sepahnews.com.</p>
      <p>The Guards said the "incidents were ended in less than 24 hours and in some cities in 72 hours" as a result of the "armed forces' insight and timely action".</p>
      <p>The "arrest of the rioters' leaders has contributed significantly to calming the situation".</p>
      <p>Protest leaders were arrested by the Guards' intelligence arm in the province of Tehran and Alborz as well as in the southern city of Shiraz, according to the statement.</p>
      <p>A near-total internet blackout remained in effect on Thursday, with Iranians abroad tweeting hashtags like #Internet4Iran and calling for an end to the outage, now in its fifth day.</p>
      <p>Iran's state TV has not aired any new footage of the unrest since Wednesday, focusing rather on "spontaneous" pro-government rallies in several cities across the country.</p>
      <p>The United Nations human rights office has said it was alarmed by reports live ammunition had caused a "significant number of deaths".</p>
      <p>Officials have confirmed five deaths, including of three security personnel stabbed by "rioters".</p>
      <p>London-based rights group Amnesty International said more than 100 demonstrators were believed to have been killed and that the real toll could be as high as 200.</p>
      <p>The full extent of the bloodshed was difficult to ascertain given the internet restrictions.</p>
      <p>Iran's mission to the UN disputed the Amnesty toll in a tweet, saying figures "not confirmed by the government are speculative" and in many cases a "disinformation campaign waged against Iran".</p>
