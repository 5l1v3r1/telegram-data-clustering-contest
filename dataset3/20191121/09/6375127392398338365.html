      <h3>CABANATUAN CITY – National Irrigation Administration chief Ricardo R. Visaya has warned of possible infiltration in the agency by the Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army (CPP-NPA) due to its association or linkages with farmers-groups such as irrigators’ associations.</h3>
      <p>“Hindi maiwasang ma-link ang NIA sa pag-re-recruit ng komunista dahil sa association natin with the farmers and the irrigators-associations,” said the former general and chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines when he spoke during the 2nd Stakeholders’ Forum on Irrigation Development for Nueva Ecija held at the Moments the Events Place here on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The stakeholders’ forum was organized by the NIA-Upper Pampanga River Integrated Irrigation Systems led by its department manager Engr. Rosalinda B. Bote and was participated in by the provincial, various local government units and national agencies, the police and military, the religious and energy sectors, the province’s congressional representatives, and members and heads of various farmers-irrigators associations.</p>
      <p>Visaya issued the warning as he cited a previous report by the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency saying that the agency was possibly being infiltrated and used as a recruitment arm by the communist movement.</p>
      <p>Although he said he does not believe in the said NICA report, the NIA chief stressed that this possible recruitment efforts being done by the CPP-NPA arose mainly because they see the  farmers-groups as the most vulnerable sectors of our society.</p>
