      <p>Hip! Hip! Hip! Hurray!!! Nigeria music superstar Davido is 27 today.</p>
      <p>The multiple chart-topping award-winning singer has blessed our eardrums with beautiful music that has either gotten us either wanting to fall in love or simply getting our groove going on the dance floor.</p>
      <p>As a way of his honouring his hard work and talent over the years, we have compiled a list of his best hit songs in no particular order. Find below:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fall</b>
      </p>

      <p>Davido released ‘Fall’ in 2017 and the mega smash hit-song would go on to win him several awards. Considered by many critics as his introduction to the foreign audience,  Fall climbed to the number one position on Most Shazamed song in the New York, US and featured on the Billboard most listened to RnB songs in the US for 2018. Eliciting that level of interest in America is no small feat for an African singer. Even the singer himself was surprised at the success of the song, which he said he had already forgotten about by the time it began breaking grounds in US.</p>
      <p>As at Tuesday, March 5 2019, the crossover hit had spent eight weeks on the chart peaking at the No 26 position since it made its way into the charts in 2018, nearly a year after it was released.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fia</b>
      </p>

      <p>Still reeling off the success of songs like ‘IF’ and ‘Fall’, Davido continued his domination of the airwaves with the release of ‘Fia’. An instant hit, the song upon release immediately jumped to the forefront of every major music charts in Nigeria. Fia presently has 70 million views on YouTube and remains one of Davido’s most featured songs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Skelewu</b>
      </p>

      <p>This song is one of the many songs that would establish Davido as a force to be reckoned with in the music industry. The smart move to promote the song with an instructional dance video and competition made it spread like wildfire and turned it into a massive hit. The Skelewu dance was one that many of us were only too happy to hop on.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Assurance</b>
      </p>

      <p>Davido reestablished the lost hope in true love for many with ‘Assurance’, a song which is an ode to his lover, Chioma. The accompanying music video shot in idyllic Barbados and amazing chemistry between both lovers all played a factor in pushing this song to the consciousness of the listeners and buying Chioma a N30 million assurance gift certainly came in handy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>IF</b>
      </p>

      <p>Another love song by Davido, a catchy lingo, ‘<i>30 billion for the account o’</i> was birthed thanks to the song.  So melodious and infectious is ‘IF’ that the singer expressed surprise that ‘Fall’ did better than it in the US. “If” with its   slow tempo and unfussy beat will surely have you nodding to it on the first listen.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blow My Mind</b>
      </p>

      <p>As we get ready for the release of Davido’s “A Good Time” later today, we have to admit that July already summoned his album’s breezy lead single “Blow My Mind”. He had help on the song from international singer, Chris Brown. Apple’s virtual assistant, Siri even identified the song as the most popular song in the world earlier this year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aye</b>
      </p>

      <p>“Aye” is a romantic track that builds on a shuffling beat and light guitars. In the music video, we see the billionaire son David play the role of a poor farmer who falls in love with the prince’s love interest.</p>
