      <p>“Many of our winning authors reflect on contemporary or historical issues within Irish society, while other amuse, inspire and enthral through fantastic storytelling. Both the winning authors and all our shortlisted titles are a terrific testament to the strength and vitality of Irish writing – and long may this continue.” </p>
