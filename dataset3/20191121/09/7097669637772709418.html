      <h1>You Get What You Pay for with China's CH-4 Drones</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:48:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">David Axe</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point:</b> U.S. drones are better made and customers are learning the hard way that they are worth the higher price.</p>
      <p>China’s CH-4 killer drone appears to be falling out of favor with some of its major operators.</p>
      <p>The Iraqi air force is down to just one operational CH-4 out of a fleet of around 10, <a href="https://www.dodig.mil/In-the-Spotlight/Article/1926768/lead-inspector-general-for-operation-inherent-resolve-quarterly-report-to-the-u/">according to</a> an August 2019 report from the U.S. inspector-general.</p>
      <p>Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S.-led operation targeting Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria, told the inspector-general that maintenance problems have grounded most of the Iraqi CH-4s.</p>
      <p>The CH-4 is roughly similar to the U.S.-made MQ-1 Predator. The Chinese unmanned aerial vehicle, which is remotely-controlled via satellite and can carry a variety of missiles, briefly was popular among Middle East militaries that balked at the cost, politics and paperwork associated with acquiring armed drones from the United States.</p>
      <p>But the Chinese drones seem to be going out of style. The Jordanian air force in June 2019 put up for sale its own six CH-4s.</p>
      <p>It’s unclear why Amman is trying to get rid of its CH-4s just three years after acquiring them. But it’s possible the divestment is related to Jordan’s ongoing efforts to source Predator-style drones from the United States.</p>
      <p>Jordan bought the missile-armed CH-4s around 2016 after the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama rejected Amman’s request for MQ-1s.</p>
      <p>General Atomics also makes the larger MQ-9 Reaper drone.</p>
      <p>The Jordanian air force’s No. 9 Squadron operated the Chinese-made drones. The same unit operates the air force’s other unmanned aerial vehicle, including Schiebel S-100 Camcopters and Leonardo Falcos.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until May 2018 that the Jordanian air force displayed a CH-4 in public.</p>
      <p>“Marketed by Aerospace Long-March International Trade, the CH-4B has found a good market here in the Middle East, in part due to the reluctance of U.S. authorities to sell armed UAVs to their allies in the region,” <i>Al-Monitor </i><a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/05/pentagon-china-weapons-growth-middle-east-arms-market.html#ixzz5pwBJmQYz">reported</a>.</p>
