        <b>Millie Bobby Brown was serving all kinds of power looks as she delivered a powerful speech at the UN this week, to promote anti-bullying on World Children’s Day alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/david-beckham/">David Beckham</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/stranger-things/">Stranger Things</a> actress donned her chequered powder blue power suit and hit the stage to campaign for more action towards anti-bullying measures for children.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on Wednesday, Millie explained how she was ‘scared’ to go to school because of bullying and wanted to ‘use [her] voice’ and platform to encourage change.</p>
      <p>‘I’m proud to add my voice to all those around the world who are asking for solutions to today’s problems such as bullying, access to education, mental health awareness, suicide prevention and climate change,’ Millie told the audience.</p>
      <p>‘In world capitals, in buildings like this, adults talk about children’s rights. But today, young people don’t want to be talked about. They want to do the talking. In the words of one young person: “Be an active voice. Don’t let things go unnoticed”.’</p>

      <p>Millie, 15, went on to admit that she and retired footballer David have been ‘very lucky’ to achieve fame and fortune but stated she takes ‘nothing for granted’.</p>
      <p>‘But I also know what it feels like to be vulnerable. At school, I was bullied by a group of students. I remember feeling helpless. School used to be a safe place. Now I was scared to go,’ she revealed.</p>

      <p>Fortunately, Millie had the help of her friends and family to overcome the ‘negative feelings’ and to ‘take [her] power back’.</p>
      <p>The actress explained: ‘But millions of children aren’t so lucky. They’re still struggling in the darkness. Wrestling with fear. With insecurity. Bullying and online threats are never harmless. Never just words. It puts children’s mental health at risk.</p>
      <p>‘It causes stress. And in the most extreme cases, and in areas around the world where conflict and violence are daily threats, it can lead to self-harm. Sickness. And even suicide.’</p>

      <p>Millie vows to use her role as a UN Goodwill Ambassador to continue raising awareness about the issue.</p>

      <p>In an Instagram post, the actress explained how proud she was to follow in the footsteps of her ‘idol’ Audrey Hepburn, who also addressed world leaders about children’s rights. She described her appearance as her ‘dream day’.</p>
      <p>In his own speech, David, 44, commended Millie for speaking out about her bullying ordeal to campaign for change.</p>
      <p>‘The future doesn’t belong to us. It belongs to children,’ David said.</p>
      <p>‘Please join me in this mission for children, and let’s listen to our young people, because they will show us the way. I am proud to be here lending my voice to this conversation and supporting brilliant young activists like Millie Bobbie Brown who is using her platform to command attention to the cause.’</p>
      <p>So basically, Millie is set for world domination.</p>
