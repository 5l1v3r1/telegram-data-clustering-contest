      <p>When I first tried infrared back in the early 1970s my choices were between purchasing black and white print IR film or colour IR slide film.</p>
      <p>I tried the colour slide film, but at that time I wasn’t a fan of colour photographs and to make a reasonable print from a slide meant waiting a week or so for the film to get processed, (special handling also) then selecting an image for printing, sending it away again for an internegative copy to be made, and then a final print enlargement. The whole process was not only costly, but time consuming.</p>
      <p>As I have written before, Infrared film was a hassle. But nevertheless, I enjoyed the final images and shot IR black and white film for years.</p>
      <p>When I became aware of digital infrared conversions I had my 6 MP Nikon D100 camera converted after I had been using it hard for some years. I purchased that camera in 2001 and expected it would, like a film camera, last forever. However, in this past year it began having problems keeping the data that I thought was being written to the memory card and I decided to start looking for another camera.</p>
      <p>I answered an ad I found on eBay and bought a newer model. So that well used 2001, 6MP infrared camera has now been changed to a 2010, 16MP infrared camera.</p>
      <p>Since that first DSLR, a lot has happened in the world of digital infrared. When I had that D100 altered there wasn’t much difference in IR filter availability. However, I now spent time deciding what the final IR effect was that I wanted.</p>
      <p>I could stay with just black and white as I was used to, or choose any of several filters that are from total IR blocking to those allowing some visible light to show through.</p>
      <p>I chose a filter called “super colour”. Now instead of only the black and white tones I get four color tones: Red, Yellow, Blue and Cyan.</p>
      <p>With the super colour filter recording four colour tones of data I was pleased to not only have what is called “faux colours”, deep yellows, blues and muted red to work with, but when I convert a Super Color image to B&amp;W I have many tones grey and black.</p>
      <p>With my old camera all I needed to do was to go to Photoshop and change my blue channel and red channels, then turn the image to black and white. I like B&amp;W, but as with my normal DSLR that starts with colour and then gets changed to B&amp;W I decided to take the chance that I would like the extra data the Super Color conversion offers.</p>
      <p>Well, I do. Although this conversion isn’t as forgiving in flat, overcast light as my old camera, and that somewhat limits the times I can get really good RAW images without needing to go to Photoshop or one of the other programs I have installed on my computer.</p>
      <p>On a sunny day the pictures are stunning. Many are good enough to just stay as they are.</p>
      <p>I am planning my yearly trek to photograph Christmas lights. That’s less than a month away and I am hoping there will be snow and at least a mostly sunny day along the waterfront and city streets so I can get some good infrared photographs when I first get there. I want it all, snowy streets and just cold enough so I can photograph people ice skating at night, and clear enough so I can get silhouettes of the buildings in the early morning and, of course, some good infrared photos during the day.</p>
