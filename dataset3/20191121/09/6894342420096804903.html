      <h1>ASUS ROG Strix Go 2.4 Uses AI For Noise Cancelling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:30:29+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lowyat.net/author/ian/" target="_blank">Ian Chee</a></address>
      <p>Artificail intelligence (AI) and noise cancelling headsets aren’t usually two ideas that you’d put together. But that’s the case with the ASUS ROG Strix Go 2.4. This is a gaming headset that uses AI to improve its noise-cancelling feature.</p>
      <p>ASUS says that the AI that’s used with the ROG Strix Go 2.4 learns from “a massive, deep-lersning database to accurately identify and counteract environmetal noises”. The company also has audio samples of different types of noise cancellations on the headset’s product page to illustrate the differences between them.</p>
      <p>As the name suggests, the headset makes use of the 2.4GHz WiFi band for its wireless capability. This is primarily done through a USB-C adapter. For devices that do not come with a USB-C port, the headset also comes with a USB-C to USB 2.0 dongle. The 33.5mm audio jack remains an option, which also comes with support for Hi-Res Audio as an added bonus.</p>

      <p>The ASUS ROG Strix Go 2.4 comes with an integrated microphone, in addition to a detachable boom mic. Both can make use of the AI-powered noise cancelling feature. It doesn’t look like there are any tradeoffs when choosing one option over the other either.</p>
      <p>Other items on its spec sheet include 40mm neodymium drivers, a battery that can provice 25 hours of use, and fast charging for three hours of use after 15 minutes of charging.</p>
      <p>TechSpot reports that the ASUS ROG Strix 2.4 is expected to cost around GBP159.99 (~RM863). We’ve reached out to ASUS Malaysia, and we’re told that it’s expected to make its way here in December 2019. The company has yet to confirm the exact date, or its accompanying local pricetag.</p>
