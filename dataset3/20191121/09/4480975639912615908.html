      <h1>USD/INR Technical Analysis: Consolidates above 38.2% Fibo., 71.65-60 pivotal support</h1>

      <p>The USD/INR pair continued with its struggle to build on its attempted moves beyond the 72.00 handle and remained confined well within a three-day-old narrow trading band.<br/> <br/>Currently hovering around 200-hour SMA, the 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the 70.53-72.37 move up – the 0.7165-60 region – might continue to act as immediate support for the pair.<br/> <br/>Sustained weakness below the mentioned support might be seen as a key trigger for bearish traders and accelerate the slide further towards 61.8% Fibo. support near the 71.20 region.<br/> <br/>Some follow-through selling has the potential to drag the pair further towards testing sub-71.00 levels and also set the stage for an extension of the near-term depreciating move.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, bulls are likely to wait for a sustained strength beyond the 72.00 mark, above which the pair could aim back towards monthly tops around the 72.35-40 region.<br/> <br/>The momentum could further get extended towards September monthly peak, around the 72.65 region, which if cleared will negate any near-term bearish bias for the pair.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, neutral technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on hourly charts haven't been supportive of any firm direction and thus, warrant some cautions before placing aggressive bets.</p>
