      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:56:00+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theinquirer.net/author/profile/2353/carly-page" target="_blank">Carly Page</a></address>
      <p><b>IT'S OFFICIAL:</b> Apple's 2019 iPhone lineup is here, and comprises the iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max and, er, iPhone 11. </p>
      <p>The Pro-branded models are being touted as the "most powerful iPhones ever", naturally, and are the first to sport triple-camera arrays. They also feature a new "Pro" design that's crafted from matte stainless steel, all-new 5.8in and 6.5in Super Retina RDX displays and Apple's newly-debuted A13 Bionic CPU.</p>
      <p>The lesser-spec iPhone 11 also features an "all-new" design, with its reworked glass and aluminium chassis said to be the toughest on a smartphone to date. There's also a new camera setup comprising 12MP wide-and ultra-wide lenses, and an array of new colour options including yellow, purple and green.</p>
      <p>We've rounded up everything you need to know about Apple's trio of new iPhones below. You can also check out our full reviews of the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3081782/iphone-11-review">iPhone 11</a> and <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3082721/iphone-11-pro-review">iPhone 11 Pro</a>. </p>
      <p><b>Release date<br/></b>The iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max and iPhone 11 started shipping set on 20 September, with pre-orders kicking off a week earlier on 13 September.</p>
      <p>However, for those who didn't get their pre-order in early, shipping times have slipped here in Blighty. All iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max models are now shipping between 15 and 22 October, while the iPhone 11 remains in stock and is shipping from 1 October. </p>
      <p><b>Price<br/></b>Apple has announced that, here in Blighty, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/iphone-11-pro/">the iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max is available from £1,099 and £1,149</a>, respectively, despite fetching $999 and $1,099 in the US. </p>

      <p><b>Latest news<br/>21/11/19: </b>Apple has launched new versions of its Smart Battery Cases for the iPhone 11. Unlike previous versions, the chunky accessory - available now for the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max - include a dedicated camera button that can launch the Camera app and take a photo.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/ffa8a9d6-b916-4bf0-9a1b-bafcf3b87392/2/fill/SmartBatteryCase-600x334.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Naturally, they also equip the iPhones with more juice; Apple claims up to 50 per cent longer battery life in a non-stop video playback test. Here in Blighty, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/search/smart-battery-case?src=globalnav">the cases are available to pick up for £129</a>. </p>
      <p><b>9/10/19: </b>Early adopters of the iPhone 11 are complaining that mysterious scratches are appearing on their handset. A <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250669687">15-page mega-thread on the Apple forum</a> sees users moaning that unsightly marks have appeared out-of-the-blue, claiming their devices were neither dropped nor did they come in contact with a rough surface.</p>
      <p>"I have a legit crack/scratch in my screen that showed up out of nowhere. No drop, no incident," one disgruntled iPhone owner moaned, with another adding: "The same happened to my iPhone Pro. I just got it yesterday and kept it in a pocket with nothing else. Less than a day later and there's already a scratch."</p>
      <p>Apple, which claimed the iPhone 11 lineup boasts the toughest glass of any iPhone to date, has yet to respond to the complaints. </p>
      <p><b>4/10/19:</b> Apple is reportedly increasing production of its iPhone 11 lineup, citing "better than expected demand." As per a report at <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-increases-production-of-iPhone-11-sources"><i>Nikkei</i></a>, Apple has asked suppliers to produce an extra eight million units - a 10 per cent increase - as the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro prove more popular than last year's iPhone XS lineup. The cheapest iPhone 11 model is proving the most popular, according to the report, while Apple has slightly revised down orders for its top-of-the-line iPhone 11 Pro Max. </p>
      <p><b>3/10/19:</b> Apple's Deep Fusion camera is now available on iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max handsets running the newly-released iOS 13.2 public beta. The feature kicks in automatically when it detects medium to low lighting and uses AI to improve the sharpness of images by capturing frames of different exposures and merging into one. </p>
      <p>Apple explains: "Deep Fusion is a new image processing system enabled by the Neural Engine of A13 Bionic. Deep Fusion uses advanced machine learning to do pixel-by-pixel processing of photos, optimizing for texture, details and noise in every part of the photo."</p>
      <p><b>26/9/19: </b>Apple has confirmed that its new iPhones will display a warning message if their screen is replaced by a third-party. In a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210321">support document</a>, the company advises that "only technicians who have completed Apple service training and who use Apple genuine parts and tools should replace iPhone displays" adding that non-certified repairs could result in "improper function or issues with display quality or safety", including non-responsive multi-touch, broken True Tone and correct display calibration. </p>
      <p>The alert will show on iPhone 11, 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max handsets running iOS 13.1 and above, and reads. "Important Display Message. Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple display." The notification will stay on your lock screen for four days, after which it'll be moved to the Settings app. </p>
      <p><b>23/9/19: </b>iFixit has been <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+11+Pro+Max+Teardown/126000">quick to pull apart Apple's top-spec iPhone 11 Pro Max</a>, in turn reviving rumours of bilateral wireless charging support. After prying off the rear of the handset, the teardown team noted that there are two battery connectors, the second of which has a direct line to the wireless charging coil, possibly to monitor the transfer of two-way power. While reverse wireless charging is not officially supported on the new iPhones, it looks like the hardware is potentially there. </p>
      <p><b>19/9/19: It's </b>not even out yet, but someone has already managed to pull apart an iPhone 11 Pro Max. The teardown,  courtesy of <a href="https://youtu.be/zdPyxKkO1co">DChannel on YouTube</a>, reveals that the Apple's highest-spec iPhone 11 model packs a 4,000mAh 15.04 watt-hour battery - that's almost 25 per cent larger than the XS Max's 12.06 watt-hour offering. Apple once again has used an L-shaped battery to stuff in as much capacity as possible, a design it first debuted with the now-defunct iPhone X. </p>

      <p><b>10/9/19: </b>Apple has unveiled its 2019 iPhones: the iPhone 11 Pro, 11 Pro Max and entry-level iPhone 11.</p>
      <p>The Pro-branded models are, naturally, being touted as Apple's most-powerful iPhones to date and both handsets sport an all-new "Pro-grade" surgical-grade stainless steel chassis with a matte finish that will be available in midnight green and gold finishes.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/57639132-6d48-472c-bce3-085f711f0d2a/2/fill/iPhone11Pro-600x334.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>More interestingly, the handsets are first to sport triple-camera arrays, with Apple adding a new 12MP wide-angle lens alongside the main and telephoto lenses. While this setup will allow you to capture more of a scene, it also means you'll have to put up with a bulge on the backside of the handset thanks to its Pixel 4-esque square camera hump. </p>
      <p>Like Google, Apple is also souping-up its camera software. The iPhone 11 lineup will ship with a dedicated Night mode to improve performance in dark lighting, which kicks in automatically when you're shooting in the dark.</p>
      <p>Underneath the bulging hood, the new iFlagships sport Apple's 13 Bionic CPU, which it's proudly touting as the "fastest CPU ever in a smartphone," adding that it also has "the fastest GPU in a smartphone," too. As well as equipping the iPhone 11 Pro with more power, Apple is promising four hours of extra battery life when compared to last year's iPhone XS.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVEemOmHw9Y" width="560" height="315" data-service="Youtube" scrolling="no"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The iPhone 11 Pro and Pro Max also feature 5.8in 6.8in and "Super Retina XDR" OLED screens with a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio and up to 1,200 nits of brightness and, finally, a fast charger included in the box. </p>
      <p>The simply-named iPhone 11 is Apple's new entry-level model. It features an anodised aluminium and glass chassis the Apple claims the toughest found on a smartphone to date and is available in a number of new colours including purple, white, yellow, green, black, red.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/f37137b1-f3c4-4845-be3f-e2a467259d47/2/fill/iPhone11-600x334.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>While it doesn't boast the same triple-camera setup as its flagship siblings, it does feature an upgraded dual-camera setup that comprises 12MP wide and ultra-wide sensors. </p>
      <p><b>10/9/19: </b>Analyst Ming Chi-Kuo has spouted some last-minute iPhone 11 predictions, and it's not good news. As reported by <i><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/09/09/kuo-iphone-11-apple-pencil-more/">9to5Mac</a></i>, Kuo believes that Apple will drop the long-rumoured wireless power-sharing functionality from this year's iPhones because "charging efficiency may not meet Apple's requirements", though he notes that the new handsets will offer fast charging support out of the box. He's also thrown out previous rumours of Apple Pencil support for the iPhone 11.</p>
      <p><b>9/9/19: </b>Apple has announced that, for the first time, you'll be able to stream its 10 September iPhone event on YouTube; previously, Apple forced watchers to use an Apple device or Microsoft's Edge browser on Windows 10. The event will kick-off at 6pm UK time on Tuesday, and we'll be bringing you all of the news as it happens. Natch. </p>
      <p><b>6/9/19: </b>We're just a few days away from the official launch of the iPhone 11, so - naturally-  images have appeared online that allegedly give us a look at the devices' final design.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/48a8c11e-9421-441b-be13-c420583e1f96/1/iPhone11leak-600x334.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The snaps (<i>above</i>), which come via accessory maker <a href="https://noodcases.com/">Nood Cases</a>, show off the handset's familiar, sleek design, and show off the long-rumoured triple-lens camera system that's housed in a square bump in the iPhone 11's rear. Interestingly, the casemaker refers to the three incoming iPhone models as the <i>iPhone XIR 11</i>, <i>iPhone XI 11 Pro</i> and <i>iPhone XI 11 Pro Max</i>.</p>
      <p><b>4/9/19: </b>A leaked internal document has confirmed that Apple has three iPhones lined up for next week; the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. The document, spied by <i><a href="https://twitter.com/AppleBeta2019/status/1168996933949689857?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">AppleBeta2019</a> </i>also states that the new iPhones will run iOS 13.0 out of the box, with 13.0.1 rolling out as an OTA update in October followed by the stable release of iOS 13.1.</p>
      <p>The 10-page document, seen by <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/09/03/leaked-apple-document-reveals-iphone-11-branding-os-release-dates-new-ipads-in-october-more"><i>AppleInsider</i></a>, also says that four new Apple Watches will be unveiled in September, with two new iPad models set to arrive the following month. </p>
      <p><b>3/9/19: </b>The iPhone 11's A13 chipset has prematurely appeared on <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v4/cpu/14528580">Geekbench</a>. The benchmarks, which confirm the new iPhone will boast 4GB RAM compared, show the iPhone 11 scoring 5,415 for single-core and 11,294 for multi-core. If legit, this means Apple's new iPhones are about 12 per cent faster for single-core tasks, but the multicore score remains unchanged hinting that the A13 chip will continue to include six cores, presumably in an identical setup to the A12.</p>
      <p><b>28/8/19: </b>Apple has reportedly culled the iPhone 11's rumoured 'Walkie-Talkie' feature just weeks ahead of the handset's launch. So says <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-puts-walkie-talkie-iphone-project-on-hold"><i>The Information</i></a>, which reports that the feature, dubbed 'Project OGRS (Off-Grid Radio Service)' internally, was being developed in partnership with Intel and would have allowed messages to be sent between iPhones over long-distance radio waves that bypass cellular networks.</p>
      <p>It's unclear why Apple scrapped the feature, though <i>The Information</i> notes that the departure of the executive in charge of the project, Ruben Caballero, may have been a factor, as could Apple's decision to ditch Intel in favour of a Qualcomm modem.</p>
      <p><b>27/8/19: </b>With just weeks to go until Apple's next iPhone launch, a YouTuber claims to have posted the first hands-on video with the iPhone 11 Pro. The clip, shared by ConceptsiPhone, shows off a dummy iPhone 11 unit, all-but-confirming its bulging square-shaped camera array that's surrounded by the same gold stainless steel that runs around the edges of the device. The two-minute-long video doesn't tell us much else we don't already know, but one thing's for sure: you're going to need a new case. </p>
      <p><b>22/8/19: </b>A new mega-report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-22/iphone-11-new-ipad-pro-16-inch-macbook-pro-airpods-3-features"><i>Bloomberg</i></a> claims Apple's incoming iPhones will feature triple-camera systems, reverse wireless charging functionality and a new multi-angle Face ID sensor.</p>
      <p>The report also affirms rumours about the "Pro" naming scheme for Apple's OLED models. Both the Pro and the so-called Pro Max will feature triple cameras comprising wide-angle, telephoto and ultra-wide lenses, according to the report, while the iPhone XR sequel will be upgraded from a single to a dual-camera system.</p>
      <p>The iPhone 11 Pro's camera software is also getting an upgrade; it'll be able to take three images simultaneously from each of the lenses and combine them together to create higher-resolution pictures "rivalling some traditional cameras", according to <i>Bloomberg</i>, and will boast improved low-light capabilities. </p>
      <p>Reserve wireless charging is also coming, allowing users to juice AirPods on the back of the handsets, as is an upgraded "multi-angle" Face ID system that captures a wider field of view so that users can unlock the handsets more easily, the report claims. </p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg</i> also confirms earlier rumours of a new matte design, noting that "at least some colours" will feature the dull finish. The design will be more durable too, with souped-up water resistance and better shatter-resistance. </p>
      <p><b>22/8/19: </b>Images of cases for the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, revealed by retailer <a href="https://www.mobilefun.co.uk/olixar-genuine-leather-iphone-11-pro-case-apple-pencil-holder-black-76272">MobileFun</a>, have added weight to earlier rumours that the handsets will boast Apple Pencil support.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.theinquirer.net/w-images/c995f423-6fb3-4490-b853-c834b2a5e26e/3/fill/iPhone11Procase-600x334.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Olixar case (<i>above</i>) features a cutout to hold an Apple Pencil, though it won't be the same version that ships with the iPad Pro. Rather, the casemaker expects the iPhone 11 Pro to feature a shorter, lighter design that will be optimised for Apple's smartphone line-up.</p>
      <p><b>21/8/19:  </b>Yet another rumour is claiming that the iPhone 11 will drop the long-standing 5W charger in favour of the same USB-C charger that ships with the iPad Pro. CharerLab has tweeted (<i>below</i>) that the new iPhones will ship with an Apple USB-C plug and a Lightning to USB-C cable in the box, which - if correct - would mark the first time the iPhone has shipped with a fast charger.</p>
      <p>However, as per <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/21/usb-c-iphone-11-charger/"><i>9to5Mac</i></a>, it's worth noting that ChargerLAB tweeted a similar prediction last year, incorrectly claiming that the charger would ship with the iPhone XS and iPhone XR. </p>
      <p><b>20/8/19: </b>Apple's iPhone 11 lineup will boast an all-new design and double the storage of last year's models, according to YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/o4kQkwzZi3k">EverythingApplePro</a> and <i>XDA Developers'</i> <a href="https://twitter.com/mweinbachxda">Max Weinbach.</a></p>
      <p>Echoing recent predictions from Ming-Chi Kuo, the tipsters claim that certain 2019 iPhone models will feature a new "rainbow" design; Apple isn't planning a multicoloured iPhone, but the handsets will reportedly feature a new coating that will give them a rainbow-like "shimmer" appearance, similar to that seen on the <a href="https://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/review/3080134/note-10-review-hands-on">Galaxy Note 10</a>.</p>
      <p>They also point to a new matte back on the iPhone 11 lineup, that will feel "very different" compared to Apple's current crop of handsets. </p>
      <p>Seperately, the leak points to more storage on this year's iPhones; while the iPhone XS and XR come with 64GB base storage, the incoming models will allegedly boast 128GB base storage, along with 256GB and 512GB configurations. </p>
      <p><b>12/8/19: </b>Apple's highest-spec 2019 iPhone could arrive as the iPhone 11 Pro. So says reliable Twitter tipster <a href="https://twitter.com/coiiiiiiiin/status/1160064724177784833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">CoinX</a>, who last year accurately predicted the names of the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR, tweeted: "'Pro' for iPhone? Crazy naming schemes over the past few years."</p>
      <p>Separately, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/08/10/iphone-11-pro-rumor/"><i>MacRumours</i></a> received a tip from an anonymous source claiming that: "The square camera iPhone will be called the iPhone 11 Pro. This is a fact." </p>
