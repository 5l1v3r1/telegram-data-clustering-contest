      <p>Amazon Prime Original’s One Mic Stand has been receiving mixed reviews. The unscripted show created by Sapan Verma features five celebrities – <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shashi-tharoor/">Shashi Tharoor</a>, Richa Chadha, Bhuvan Bam, Taapsee Pannu and Vishal Dadlani trying their hand at stand-up comedy for the first time. And, mentoring them are ace comedians Zakir Khan, Rohan Joshi, Angad Singh Ranyal, Ashish Shakya and Kunal Kamra.</p>
      <p>Recently, host Sapan and the mentors spoke exclusively to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a>. While they revealed how interesting it was for them to mentor the celebrities, we asked who would they want to collaborate with in Season 2 of One Mic Stand. And pat came the replies:</p>
      <p><b>Zakir Khan:</b> It has to be Shah Rukh Khan. I feel he should just release an hour of his interviews and people should pay to watch him. He is not only intelligent but also knows what to speak while interacting with people.</p>
      <p><b>Sapan Verma</b>: Yes, SRK would be the best choice. We have worked with him on various award shows, and if he finds out you are into comedy, he will actually discuss the space with you. And he is so insightful, not just about contemporary films but he has followed all the comedians of the 80s and 90s. I don’t know if he was serious, but he once told me that he wanted to do stand-up. But that time, the culture hadn’t developed much in India. I hope he can feature in season 2 and I promise, all of us would be more than happy to mentor him.</p>
      <p>R<b>ohan Joshi:</b> I would pick <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sachin-tendulkar/">Sachin Tendulkar</a>. He has lived through the entire dramatic Indian cricket journey for 25 years. I don’t think there’s anyone who would have more stories than him.</p>
      <p><b>Angad Singh Ranyal:</b> <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/priyanka-chopra/">Priyanka Chopra</a>. We recently shot a video with her and she is genuinely so funny. Also, she has this middle-class upbringing which increases her relatability factor.</p>

        <b>One important tip you want to share with upcoming standup comedians</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Angad:</b> Be on stage as much as you can. Also, be yourself and form a unique voice. Don’t do topics that people have already done unless you have something very different to say.</p>
      <p><b>Rohan:</b> Don’t quit your day job until you are being paid the same salary or more for six-eight months in a row for doing comedy.</p>
      <p><b>Sapan:</b> While the comedy scene has definitely evolved, it’s still difficult to break through. Also very important, perform for the audience and not (to impress) the other comedians in the room. The act should be just between you and your audience.</p>
      <p><b>Zakir:</b> Well, firstly, if you are still looking for tips, you are already very late. I feel, today, there’s no lack of opportunity as more and more cities, even towns have started having open mics. Also, what’s really important is don’t become a burden to your art. Just because you cannot do your 9-5 job, doesn’t mean that the little humour you have should get you a living. Be honest with your craft and talent.</p>
