      <p>Former governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has resigned from the opposition party.</p>
      <p>Concise News had reported last week that the <a href="https://www.concisenews.global/2019/11/12/edo-pdp-supends-ize-iyamu-over-alleged-plan-to-join-apc/">PDP in a statement</a> by its Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, suspended Ize-Iyamu over his alleged plan to defect to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).</p>
      <p>The statement said that the temporary suspension was informed by his unwillingness to confirm or refute his rumoured defection to the APC.</p>
      <p>It explained that the suspension remained until he “acknowledges, accepts and addresses the issue of his decamping to APC.”</p>
      <p>The statement read: “In the last few days, the Edo PDP has been inundated with calls and inquiries regarding the stories trending both in print and social media as it concerns one of our leaders, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu.</p>
      <p>“The party leadership has patiently waited to hear or read his reaction to confirm or deny the stories, but to no avail.</p>
      <p>“We boast of being a party of men and women of integrity and high moral standing. It is a brand we have earned and wish to maintain.</p>
      <p>“As a result of the ‘uneasy quiet’ from our dear Pastor and the impression our silence will send to our teeming supporters and followers, Edo PDP is left with no option but to announce the exclusion of Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu from all PDP related activities with immediate effect, until he acknowledges, accepts and addresses the issue of his decamping to APC. This decision has been taken without prejudice.”</p>
      <p>However, in his resignation letter to the state chairman of the PDP, Dan Orbih and made available to journalists, Ize-Iyamu said his defection from the party has nothing to do with malice or bitterness.</p>
      <p>The politician also appreciated the leadership of the PDP for the opportunity to represent the party during the governorship election in 2016.</p>
      <p>According to Ize-Iyamu, the decision to leave along with several PDP leaders across the state was unanimous. He said that it was not an easy decision to take considering the warm relationship he had with party members.</p>
      <p>“There are, however, many compelling reasons that have necessitated this resolution. But it would be uncharitable even to throw stones at a house we once inhabited with many friends and associates.</p>
      <p>“We wish to state for the records that our primary motivation in politics is to effectively represent our people in the political arena. Also to ensure that government policies and resources are for the betterment of our people “</p>
