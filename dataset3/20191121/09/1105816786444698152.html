      <p><b>KARACHI: </b>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah clarified on Thursday that he does not know the arrested MQM-London target killer Yousuf alias Thelaywala.</p>
      <p>“Last night, a video surfaced in which a terrorist was forced to say that I had met him. We have found out who created this false story,” Murad said while speaking to the media in Karachi.</p>
      <p>He said the accused was in custody of Pakistan Rangers in 2017 and questioned as to who all had access to him.</p>
      <p>“It seems that the SSP concerned is involved in this conspiracy against me. I will be speaking to the DG Rangers about this matter,” Murad added.</p>
      <p>The chief minister further stated that the Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has had several meetings with the provincial cabinet in the past and has been guiding them in regards to the party policies.</p>

      <p>“Whatever appeared in the media was out of context. The cabinet can undergo shuffle anytime and I will make the changes without consulting others,” he maintained.</p>
      <p>CM Murad also said that the police have been ordered to take action against the vehicle bearing wrong number plate and an FIR against the vehicle has also been registered which has been found to be of the Governor House.</p>
      <p>“The FIR registration has left the governor concerned,” commented the CM.</p>
