      <p>The German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy said that companies can start to apply to use 5G frequencies in the 3.7-3.8 GHz range on industrial campuses. Local frequencies enable firms to build their own private networks, rather than rely on telecommunications providers to build networks. </p>
      <p>The Automotive Industry Association (VDA) and other industry associations including the VCI, VDMA and ZVEI have welcomed the allocation of frequencies for industrial campuses. According to VDA, several dozen companies have already registered their interest in such frequencies with the Federal Network Agency. </p>
      <p>The firms believe that 5G can replace existing networks, including WLAN, provide improved coverage of entire company premises, enable full control over company data and reduce disruption to public mobile networks.</p>
      <p>The spectrum licences will be allocated based on the applicant's geographic footprint and use of a certain area. <a href="https://www.telecompaper.com/news/german-regulator-sets-formula-for-campus-5g-spectrum-fees--1314403">Prices</a> also take account the area covered by the network, as well as the amount of bandwidth used and duration of the licence. </p>
