      <h1>The f00lish broke fans are the ones who buy data to insult artistes on social media – Kwaw Kese</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:53:02+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/adu/" target="_blank">Adu Sarpeah</a></address>
      <p>Kwaw Kese’s music career is seriously bleeding, therefore, it’s no surprise that he has become an “apostle of ethics” lately on social media taking into consideration his utterances.</p>
      <p>This time around, he has taken a swipe at music enthusiasts or better still fans of artistes who take delight in lambasting musicians on social media for no apparent reason.</p>
      <p>To the best knowledge of <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/watch-the-moment-kwaw-kese-and-shatta-wale-hug-warmly-at-the-just-ended-2019-mtn-4syte-music-video-awards/">Kwaw Kese</a> in a footage he posted on Instagram, the f00lish broke fans are the ones who buy small amount of data to insults artistes on social media.</p>
      <p>“If you can buy data and come on social media just to diss people and compare other acts to others and insult them then you’re a fool. You can do better than that”, he said.</p>
      <p>Kwaw Kese, therefore, noted that it’s prudent to rather support the work of an artiste rather than comparing artistes and pitching them against each other.</p>
