      <h1>Jim Goodwin warns Jack Ross he will make his Paisley reunion as difficult as possible</h1>
      <h2>Former St Mirren manager Jack Ross is set for an emotional return to the Simple Digital Arena next Tuesday night with new side Hibernian.</h2>

      <p>Jim Goodwin is urging Saints fans to remember <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> won’t be on their side when he brings Hibs along for a Paisley reunion.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/st-mirren-fc">St Mirren</a> gaffer will guide his Edinburgh side along the M8 next Tuesday for a game that promises late night fireworks.</p>
      <p>While Goodwin hopes his close friend gets a warm reception before kick-off, he wants his team to turn up the heat on their guests as the Buddies go on the hunt for much-needed points.</p>
      <p>“We’re all well aware of how well Jack did while he was here, but it’s important to remember that he’s on the other side now,“ he told Express Sport.</p>
      <p>“As much as I hope the fans give him a warm reception, as soon as that whistle goes, we want to make his life as difficult as we possibly can.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure Jack will be thinking the same. He’s the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs</a> manager now and, at the end of the day, he’ll be coming here to Paisley to try and turn us over. He doesn’t owe us anything any more.</p>
      <p>“We’ll see how they get on against Motherwell, but we know it’s going to be a very difficult night on Tuesday when we play them.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully, we’re going into that off the back of a really positive result against Ross County.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Goodwin revealed he is close pals with Ross after linking up with him briefly at Alloa, before taking over the reins from him as manager when Ross headed to St Mirren.</p>
      <p>Goodwin is certain that his friend turned foe is the man who can turn Hibs’ shocking form around by bringing back a feel-good atmosphere in <br/>Leith.</p>
      <p>He said: “I only worked with him for a short period before I got the job myself.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a huge amount of respect for him.</p>
      <p>“He’s been very fortunate to have left a big club like Sunderland and get the opportunity to manage at one of the biggest clubs in Scotland.</p>
      <p>“They’ve got great facilities at Hibs and he’s inherited a fantastic <br/>squad.</p>
      <p>“It’s club that has certainly underachieved up until now, but they’ve certainly got the right man in there to motivate the players and rally the troops to get that positive feeling back at Easter Road.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Before Ross’ return to Paisley, St Mirren take on Ross County this Saturday as they look to get back to winning ways, having lost three away games in a row.</p>
      <p>Goodwin is hoping his fledgling strike partnership of Jon Obika and Danny Mullen can continue to keep finding the net.</p>
      <p>He added: “We scored a couple of good goals ourselves against Hearts, which was pleasing.</p>
      <p>“I’m pleased for the strikers. Danny and Jon have been on a good run of late.</p>
      <p>“They’ve developed a really good partnership and, hopefully, that can continue.”</p>
