      <h2>Prince Charles's relationship with Camilla Parker Bowes features in season three of The Crown, so we've taken a look back at their complicated romance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-21T09:55:18+00:00">21 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Charles and Camilla's relationship has been filled with controversy, heartbreak and drama, much of which has been played out in the public eye.</p>
      <p>The pair dated after meeting at a polo match, but their romance was far from straight forward and they broke up and both went on to marry other people.</p>
      <p>Charles made Diana Spencer his royal bride and the world watched on with love as they married at St Paul's Cathedral on July 29, 1981.</p>
      <p>Camilla married Andrew Parker Bowles, an Army cavalry officer with an impressive career who previously dated Princess Anne.</p>
      <p>But decades later they came back together, and earlier this year celebrated their 14th wedding anniversary.</p>
      <p>Their complicated relationship features in season three of The Crown, so we've looked back at what really happened between them.</p>

      <h3>Their first meeting</h3>
      <p>Charles and Camilla met at a polo match in Windsor Great Park back in 1970, and hit it off straight away thanks to their shared sense of humour and love of the sport.</p>
      <p>Royal biographer Christopher Wilson says the young Camilla Shand was a party animal who “moved with a lively crowd” and cared only for “evenings, weekends, horses, hunting, people and parties”.</p>
      <p>In his book, A Greater Love, Wilson said what Camilla “lacked in conventional beauty was more than made up by personality and undeniable sex appeal”. Former boyfriend Kevin Burke said: “She was terrific fun, popular, attractive and sexy. She was never tongue-tied or shy – she always had something amusing to say.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Camilla’s great-great-grandmother Alice Keppel was long-time mistress of Charles’ great-great-grandfather, Edward VII, so she reportedly used the chat-up-line was: “My great-great-grandmother was your great-great-grandfather’s mistress, so how about it?”</p>
      <p>At the time of their meeting, Camilla has been in an on-off relationship with Andrew Parker Bowes for about seven years.</p>
      <p>Charles was smitten but marriage was out of the question as Camilla was not a virgin.</p>
      <h3>Camilla's wedding</h3>
      <p>In 1973, while Charles was away serving in the Royal Navy, Andrew asked Camilla to marry him.</p>
      <p>He had broken her heart a number of times during their complicated relationship, but she accepted the proposal.</p>
      <p>Camilla <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/cruel-letter-camilla-sent-prince-13842011">wrote to Charles telling him she was engaged</a> , and is said to have broken the royal's heart.</p>
      <p>Royal author Penny Junor wrote about the letter in her book about Camilla,  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Duchess-Untold-Story-explosive-biography/dp/0008211000">The Duchess: The Untold Story</a>  .</p>
      <p>She states: "She wrote to Charles herself to tell him. It broke his heart."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Penny claims the devastated prince shared his heartbreak in letter to his friends and family.</p>
      <p>She writes: "He fired off anguished letters to his nearest and dearest.</p>
      <p>"It seemed to him particularly 'cruel', he wrote in one letter, that after 'such a blissful, peaceful and mutually happy relationship' fate had decreed that it should only last a mere six months."</p>
      <p>Andrew and Camilla tied the knot in a huge society wedding including by several members of the Royal Family, including the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.</p>
      <h3>Charles proposes to Diana</h3>
      <p>Charles and Camilla stayed pals and she encouraged him to wed Di – and he even proposed in the Parker Bowles’ veg garden.</p>
      <p>When he got down on one knee and asked Lady Diana Spencer to be his royal bride, the couple had only met 12 times.</p>
      <p>The future  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/princess-diana">Princess Diana</a>  was just 20 when her future husband invited her to Windsor Castle to ask her a question that would change her life forever.</p>
      <p>When she arrived he said: "I've missed you so much", before taking her to the castle's homely nursery.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>But his proposal wasn't exactly the most romantic gesture, and Diana reportedly started laughing when he asked the question.</p>
      <p>Royal expert Ingrid Seward says: "She burst out laughing, I think that was probably her nerves.</p>
      <p>"She didn't think it was the most romantic of proposals but she had the proposal."</p>
      <p>However she had issues with Charles' friendship with Camilla and insiders say she frequently asked about the nature of their close bond in their lead up to their Royal Wedding in 1981.</p>
      <p>But her heart was shattered just a few days before she said her vows when she walked into his private secretary Michael Colborne's office.</p>
      <p>She saw a package sitting on the desk with Camilla's name written on it, and demanded to see what was inside of it.</p>
      <p>She found a gold bracelet engraved with the letters G and F, which stood for Gladys and Fred - the nicknames Charles and Camilla used for each other.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking in Channel 5 documentary, Charles and Di: The Truth Behind their Wedding, biographer Christopher Wilson said: "I think she was very suspicious of anything Camilla.</p>
      <p>"She asked to see what was inside and eventually she was allowed to have her way.</p>
      <p>"She was absolutely in tears, in a terrible state about it.</p>
      <p>"It was clear that this was Prince Charles' farewell present to Camilla."</p>
      <p>It wasn't the first time Diana has seen a gift from Charles to his ex, and weeks previously had found a bunch of flowers with the same initials signed on the note.</p>
      <h3>Charles and Diana's wedding day</h3>
      <p>In July 1981 the world watched on as the young Diana Spencer stepped out of her car in her stunning wedding dress and walk up the steps into St Paul's Cathedral.</p>
      <p>People couldn't get enough of their fairytale romance and people fell in love with the new Princess of Wales immediately.</p>
      <p>The night before their special day Charles, who was 32 at the time, sent the note and gift to Clarence House where Diana spent the night.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite reportedly having doubts about their marriage, the note was supportive and offered her advice for the big day.</p>
      <p>In her new book about Camilla, royal author Penny Junor writes: "The night before the wedding, which Diana spent at Clarence House with her sister Jane, he sent her a note, along with a signet ring that bore the Prince of Wales feathers.</p>
      <p>"He wrote: "I'm so proud of you and when you come up I'll be there at the altar for you tomorrow. Just look 'em in the eye and knock 'em dead'", reports the  <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1048919/Royal-news-prince-charles-princess-diana-royal-wedding">Express</a> .</p>
      <p>When their marriage broke down, Camilla was largely blamed by some members of the public.</p>
      <p>She was given the nickname the The Rottweiler and “Britain’s most hated woman”, however a clever PR campaign pushed by Charles saw this slowly improve.</p>
      <h3>Diana's tell-all interview</h3>
      <p>In 1995 Diana was interviewed by BBC's Martin Bashir, during which she dropped a number of bombshells about her relationship with Prince Charles and life in the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Buckingham Palace had no idea about her interview and shortly after it aired the Queen wrote to both Diana and Charles advising them to get a divorce.</p>
      <p>She spoke for the first time of Charles's affair with Camilla Parker-Bowles, and one of the most famous quotes from the interview became: "Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She also spoke about her bulimia, saying: "That's like a secret disease.</p>
      <p>"You inflict it upon yourself because your self-esteem is at a low ebb, and you don't think you're worthy or valuable. You fill your stomach up four or five times a day - some do it more - and it gives you a feeling of comfort."</p>
      <p>Camilla’s fate as femme fatale was sealed. Yet, somehow, she managed to keep a dignified silence through years of abuse.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In a rare interview in May, Camilla told You magazine: “It was horrid, deeply unpleasant and I wouldn’t put my worst enemy through it. I couldn’t have survived it without my family.”</p>
      <p>She maintained a “glass half full” mentality, adding: “You just have to get on with it. Being British!”</p>
      <p>A longtime friend said: “She had no side, no complexity. She is 100 per cent sure of who she is.</p>
      <p>“She is warm, witty, endlessly cheerful and has the ability to laugh at everything and tease Charles out of his Eeyore grumpiness.”</p>
      <h3>Camilla's 50th birthday party</h3>
      <p>The first milestone on the journey to change public opinion on Camilla was an Arabian Nights banquet on her 50th birthday in 1997.</p>
      <p>It was for close friends, but as Mrs Parker Bowles arrived at the gates of Highgrove, in Gloucestershire, her chauffeur deliberately slowed down – so the pack of royal photographers could take her picture.</p>
      <p>Wearing a figure-hugging black dress and the diamond and pearl necklace Charles had given her, Camilla looked radiant... regal even.</p>
      <p>“She swept into Highgrove with all the confidence of a Queen,” reported one paper next morning.</p>
      <p>“More like the Queen of bloody Sheba!” stormed a furious Princess Diana when the papers reached her Kensington Palace breakfast table.</p>
      <p>Sources said that Diana, who had now been officially divorced from Charles for 11 months and was dating Dodi al-Fayed, had come to term with Charles and Camilla's relationship.</p>
      <p>But what she would never accept was Camilla replacing her as queen. Nor, it seemed, would the public.</p>
      <p>In a poll of 100,000 TV viewers that month, two-thirds thought the heir to the throne should not become king if he married Camilla.</p>
      <p>Yet Charles insisted she was now a “non-negotiable” part of his life and the 50th birthday extravaganza was a “coming out party”.</p>
      <p>But six weeks later a car crash in a Paris tunnel sent Camilla back into hiding. Diana, Queen of Hearts, was dead – and the woman she'd accused of wrecking her fairytale was Public Enemy No 1 again.</p>
      <h3>Operation Ritz </h3>
      <p>Operation Ritz was a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/operation-ritz-clever-plan-brought-13910369">perfectly planned moment</a> which saw  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-charles">Prince Charles</a>  and Camilla appear together as a couple for the first time after keeping their relationship in the shadows for years.</p>
      <p>They finally made their relationship official when they stepped out of the Ritz Hotel together after celebrating the 50th birthday of Camilla's sister Annabel Elliott on January 29, 1999.</p>
      <p>The photo op was the brainchild of spin doctor Mark Bolland, who reportedly returned to the UK from LA just to oversee the operation.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And it worked - and the photographs appeared on the front page of every British newspaper alongside surprisingly warm words. </p>
      <p>Camilla arrived at the hotel at 8.45pm with her children Tom and Laura, and the group were greeted by the hotel manager ready to start the party.</p>
      <p>Charles arrived two hours later, at about 10.55pm, having spent the evening at a charity dinner at St James's Palace.</p>
      <p>He walked to the hotel through Green Park, carrying a birthday present for the host.</p>
      <p>As they left together photographers got the picture they had been waiting for for years - a snap of the couple together.</p>
      <p>Mr Bolland was put in charge of dealing with the 'Camilla Factor' way before the death of Princess Diana.</p>
      <p>He managed to discreetly position her under the Palace wing, and closed down major areas of risk as she got ready to step into the public spotlight, reports the  <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/media-the-man-behind-operation-ritz-1068223.html">Independent</a> .</p>
      <p>Before the joint appearance there were several near misses, most of which were pulled at the last minute.</p>
      <p>The first date in the diary was a gala for the National Osteoporosis Society, in late 1997.</p>
      <p>However Camilla cancelled it after the death of Princess Diana.</p>
      <h3>Charles and Camilla marry</h3>
      <p>On April 9, 2006, the couple tied the knot in a civil ceremony in Windsor.</p>
      <p>The Queen reportedly wasn't happy with her son's decision to remarry, but there was one thing she was looking forward to that day - the Grand National.</p>
      <p>So after the Archbishop's blessing she disappeared into a side room with other racing fans, including Camilla's ex-husband, to watch the big race before making her speech.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>According to an extract of Mr Bower's book, which has been published in the  <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5520353/TOM-BOWER-Queens-Cold-War-against-Camilla.html">Daily Mail</a>  , there were a few nervous faces in the room but the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/queen-made-very-cheeky-joke-12218341">Queen opened with a rather cheeky joke</a> .</p>
      <p>Instead of taking about the happy couple and their relationship, she just spoke about the horses.</p>
      <p>She said: "I have two important announcements to make.</p>
      <p>"I know you will all want to know who was the winner of the Grand National. It was Hedgehunter.</p>
      <p>"Secondly, having cleared Becher's Brook and The Chair and all kinds of other terrible obstacles, they have come through and I'm very proud and wish them well.</p>
      <p>"My son is home and dry with the woman he loves. They are now on the home straight; the happy couple are now in the winner's enclosure."</p>
      <p>Also, you'll notice she didn't mention Camilla at all.</p>
