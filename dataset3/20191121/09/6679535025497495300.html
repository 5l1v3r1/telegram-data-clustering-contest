      <p>District Collector M. Ram Mohan Rao has asked the officials of the Municipal and Public Health departments to continue anti-larva operations and prepare a city sanitation plan detailing steps to be taken for the improvement of sanitation and prevent dengue, malaria and other seasonal diseases.</p>
      <p>He directed them to ensure cleaning of clogged drain channels and shifting garbage to dumping yards on daily basis and total prevention of plastic bags. “Though plastic products below 50 microns have reduced drastically reduced efforts must be made to prevent it completely by increasing awareness among people. If need be, penalties must be imposed on the users,” he said while addressing a meeting of Municipal, Medical and Health department officials,” here on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Collector said though cases of swine flu were not reported, and signs of the disease were not found anywhere in the district, prompt steps must be initiated against it and awareness created through local cable television channels, CDs in cinema theatres and flexi boards. “If suspicious cases come to the hospital, an isolation ward should be opened and ventilators arranged,” he added.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rao also suggested to officials to continue garbage collection by sending workers door-to-door.</p>
      <p>District Medical and Health Officer Sudarshanam, Armoor Municipal Commissioner Shailaja, Municipal Engineer Anand Sagar and Municipal Health Officer Sajid Ali were present.</p>
