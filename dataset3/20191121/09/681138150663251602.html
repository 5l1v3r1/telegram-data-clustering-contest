        <b>Emergency services have been called to a crash in Woodbridge - where a car smashed into a lamp post.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Police were called to Quayside at around 8.25am today, Thursday, November 21, after receiving reports of a single vehicle collision.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Suffolk police said a Seat Leon had collided with the lamp post and that the street light had later fallen down.</p>
      <p>She said traffic could still get past the scene of the crash, as the fallen lamp post is not fully blocking the road.</p>
      <p>Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service has also attended as there is fluid from the vehicle and broken wires from the lamp post in the road .</p>
      <p>There are not believed to be any injuries as a result of the crash.</p>
