      <h1>2020 Mitsubishi Triton Athlete is a sticker happy Strada</h1>
      <h2>Mitsubishi de-chromes the Strada</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:33:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/anton-andres.html" target="_blank">Anton Andres</a></address>
      <p>Mitsubishi is riding high on a wave of new and updated models. Right after unveiling the 2020 Mirage, the Japanese automaker then revealed a new top-spec variant of the Triton, better known here as the Strada. </p>
      <p>Dubbed the Triton Athlete, it’s an appearance package for the GT model, and it gets a lot of cosmetic tweaks inside and out. </p>

      <p>For starters, the Athlete sheds all of its chrome bits for gloss black finishes. These are seen on the grill, bumpers, side mirror caps, and even the step boards. It even gets a black roof to give the truck more visual zing, along with gloss black alloy wheels. And speaking of visual zing, it also gets graphics plastered all over its flanks to let everyone know you’re driving a Triton Athlete. Last but not least is the sports bar mounted on the pick-up’s bed, an optional accessory. </p>

      <p>Inside, drivers and passengers alike are greeted by a two-tone cabin. Regardless of the exterior color chosen, the Triton Athlete comes with an orange-on-black interior. The seats and center console are draped in orange trimmings, contrasted by black highlights and inserts. To add an air of exclusivity (and possibly bragging rights), the word ‘Athlete’ is stitched on to the front seats. The orange and black theme even carries on to the steering wheel as it gets orange stitches instead of the usual gray or black.</p>

      <p>As it is an appearance package, the engine is left untouched. It’s still the same 2.4-liter MIVEC Turbodiesel that has powered both the Triton/Strada and Montero Sport for quite some time now. Power is rated at 181 PS while torque is at 430 Nm. Unlike the Montero Sport, however, the Triton/Strada uses a six-speed automatic and not the eight-speed unit. </p>
      <p>While we won’t get the Athlete variant here, what we could get is an equivalent in the local market. A black edition model perhaps? It’s not far from reality. </p>
