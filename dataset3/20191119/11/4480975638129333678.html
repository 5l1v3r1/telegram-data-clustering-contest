      <h1>NZD/USD expected to remain in a consolidative fashion – UOB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:21:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/pablo-piovano" target="_blank">Pablo Piovano</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/nzdusd">Kiwi</a> Dollar is seen sticking to the ongoing sideline note vs. the buck, suggested FX Strategists at UOB Group.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>24-hour view: “While our expectation for <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/chart-interactive?asset=nzdusd">NZD</a></b> to trade sideways was not wrong, the registered range of 0.6390/0.6412 was much narrower than our expected range of 0.6380/0.6430. The quiet price action offers no fresh clues and NZD is likely to continue to trade sideways. Expected range for today, 0.6375/0.6415”.</p>
      <p>Next 1-3 weeks: “There is not much to add as NZD traded in a quiet manner and closed little changed (0.6398, +0.01%). We continue to hold the same view from last Friday (15 Nov, spot 0.6380) wherein NZD is “expected to trade sideways between 0.6350 and 0.6465 for a while more”.</p>
