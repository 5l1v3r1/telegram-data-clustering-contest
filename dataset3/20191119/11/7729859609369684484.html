      <p>West Indies captain Taylor said: "I can't wait to join Southern Brave.</p>
      <p>"The other three players we've already announced are very strong and it's going to be such a great competition. I'm really looking forward to working under Charlotte Edwards again.</p>
      <p>"There's also a strong Caribbean vibe in the men's team at Southern Brave - with Andre Russell, Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan - so it will be nice to play alongside them and hopefully both teams can have success."</p>

      <p><b>Jess Jonassen</b>, the top ODI bowler in the world, will join up with Australia team-mate Meg Lanning at Welsh Fire, while fellow Aussies <b>Rachael Haynes</b> and <b>Elyse Villani</b> head to Oval Invincibles and Trent Rockets respectively.</p>
      <p>Bowler <b>Georgia Elwiss</b> has joined her local side Birmingham Phoenix and <b>Alice Davidson-Richards</b> is to become part of Dani Hazell's Northern Superchargers squad.</p>
      <p>Manchester Originals have added experienced South African <b>Mignon du Preez,</b> who said: "There are some highly talented teams beginning to take shape and the standard is going to be very high.</p>
      <p>"I've played in the Kia Super League and I've always enjoyed it so it's really nice to come back and take part in top-quality domestic competitions.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be something a bit different but it's obviously all about trying to take cricket to as many people as possible and as players that's something we want to support. I look forward to coming back to the UK next summer and being a part of Manchester Originals."</p>
