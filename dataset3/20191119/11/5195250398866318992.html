      <h3>All the exhausts are made of stainless steel and they are almost 40 per cent lighter than the stock unit</h3>
      <p>Royal Enfield has recently announced the “Make Your Own” customization programme for its Classic 350 single-seat model. The potential customers who plan to get their hands on the new Classic 350 model will get an option to choose from optional genuine accessories offered by RE.</p>
      <p>The special customization programme is currently offered via Royal Enfield’s 141 dealerships and across six cities including, Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Pune, and Hyderabad. RE is also offering a list of 16 exhaust options for the Classic 350 under the new customization programme.</p>
      <p>The owners can choose from 16 different exhaust options by going through the company’s website. These exhausts are legal and meets both the emission and noise norms and will be available with authentic documents. They are also valid for all the BS-III and BS-IV Classic 350 models.</p>

      <p>These exhausts are made entirely out of stainless steel and are comparatively lighter by almost 40 percent than the stock unit. The good news is that these silencers also come with a two-year warranty and they are priced up to Rs. 3,600.</p>
      <p>We are not exactly sure at this moment whether adding this genuine exhaust will help in increasing the performance of the Classic 350 in any way or not. However, adding these genuine motorcycle accessories from Royal Enfield won’t void the warranty of the cruiser.</p>
