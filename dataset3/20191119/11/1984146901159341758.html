      <h1>I'm A Celebrity's Dec Donnelly drops huge hint about show's final</h1>
      <h2>The final date for the popular ITV show has not yet been announced, but host Dec teased when the latest series will end</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:52:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:52</time> by <a rel="author">Sonia Sharma, Charlotte Tutton</a></address>
      <p>Fans of I'm A Celebrity went into a little panic when Dec Donnelly hinted at the 2019 final date.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ant-dec-1">Dec and co-host Ant McPartlin</a> dropped news about how long the series was on for on ITV, with it launching last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Almost all the stars have entered the jungle including Caitlyn Jenner, Jacqueline Jossa, Ian Wright, Roman Kemp and Kate Garraway.</p>
      <p>There are two new arrivals set to enter the camp, with reports that Coronation Street's Andy Whyment and former EastEnders star Cliff Parisi are the mystery stars, reports <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/im-celebritys-dec-donnelly-drops-20911792">The Mirror.</a></p>
      <p>Now, Dec has let slip to fans how long they can expect to see their jungle favourites on screen.</p>
      <p>While there's plenty of time left on the show, fans already don't want it to end with many tipping it to "fly by".</p>
      <p>Dec said to pal Ant that there were still 20 days to go on the show.</p>
      <p>With Australia between 8-10 hours ahead of UK time, it's not clear whether they meant 20 days from Monday or Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Either way this is the usual amount of time for the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> jungle series, which last year ended on Sunday, December 9.</p>
      <p>This time around, judging by Dec's confession, it's likely to finish on Sunday, December 8.</p>
      <p>Taking to Twitter , viewers confessed they weren't quite ready for it to finish even with weeks until then.</p>
      <p>One fan said: "20 days to go, it’ll fly by," alongside a crying face emoji.</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "Dec saying 20 days left think I just nearly threw up."</p>
      <p>A third added: "20 days left omg."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile others were fully aware that was a long amount of time, with one fan commenting: "It’s day 2 Dec..."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> continues at 9pm on ITV.</p>
