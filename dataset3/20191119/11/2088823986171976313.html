      <h1>Torn-Down Tuesday: The homes of Niagara Square</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:00:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/stevecichon</a></address>
      <p>For generations, Niagara Square has been known as the civic center of Buffalo life, anchored by City Hall.</p>
      <p>Up until the 1920s, Niagara Square was also a residential address.</p>
      <p>Millard Fillmore spent most of his post-presidential years <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2018/08/29/from-1880-to-today-millard-fillmores-downtown-buffalo-addresses/">living in a sprawling mansion that was torn down</a> to build the Statler Hotel.</p>
      <p>Judge Samuel Wilkeson, the "Father of Buffalo” who was responsible for the dredging of Buffalo Harbor and securing Buffalo’s spot as the terminus of the Erie Canal, lived in a home on the spot <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2016/09/21/looked-like-wednesday-city-hall-site-1913/">where City Hall now stands</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1922, several homes were torn down to make way for the Buffalo Athletic Club.</p>
      <p>The William Greene and Stephen Austin homes, pictured at the top of this article, dated back to the 1830s when they met with the wrecking ball.</p>
      <p>Just south on Delaware Avenue, two homes on West Eagle were also torn down for the BAC.</p>
      <p>The Morning Express called the houses “survivors of domestic architecture in high favor in Buffalo in the 1830s and 40s” shortly before they were bulldozed.</p>
      <p>The house on the corner of Eagle and Delaware, below, was the home of President Cleveland’s mother-in-law. Henry E. Perrine married the widow of Cleveland’s law partner Oscar Folsom. Mrs. Perrine was the mother of Frances Folsom, who married President Cleveland in a White House ceremony.</p>
