      <h1>Ja Rule officially cleared of wrongdoing in $100m Fyre Festival lawsuit</h1>

      <p>Ja Rule has been cleared of wrongdoing in a major Fyre Festival lawsuit, two and a half years after the ill-fated festival.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old rapper has officially been dismissed from a $100 million (£77 million) civil lawsuit filed over the infamous festival – which was discovered to be a scam as artists cancelled and revellers’ ‘luxury’ accommodation never materialised.</p>
      <p>Attendees represented by attorney Mark Geragos filed a class action lawsuit against Fyre Fest’s founder Billy McFarland – who is currently in jail – and other executives, with co-founder Ja Rule also named.</p>
      <p>The Always On Time rapper was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/11/ja-rule-shut-class-action-lawsuit-shambolic-fyre-festival-10164159/">dropped from the legal action in July 2019,</a> with lawyers attempting to re-add Ja – real name Jeffrey Bruce Atkins – to the class action lawsuit amid allegations he had advance knowledge the festival was going to be a disaster.</p>

      <p>However, Judge P Kevin Castel has side with Ja and dropped him from the civil lawsuit.</p>

      <p>Judge Castel said: ‘This Court rejected plaintiffs’ conclusory assertions that they relied on defendants’ representations about the Festival as insufficient to state a claim for fraud.</p>
      <p>‘In the case of Atkins, plaintiffs alleged an actionable false statement, but failed to allege that they acted in reliance thereon.’</p>
      <p>Ja’s lawyer Ryan Hayden Smith <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/exclusive-rapper-ja-rule-emerges-victorious-dismissed-from-100-million-fyre-festival-lawsuit-WgONp8DVuUKFxNEXXsLosQ/">told AllHipHop.com:</a> ‘This ruling is nothing short of a total vindication of Mr. Atkins.’</p>

      <p>Ja had teamed up with Billy McFarland on Fyre Fest to promote the Fyre music booking app, with celebs including Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner promoting the fesival on Great Exuma on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Revellers expected luxury villas and tents, meals from celebrity chefs and a line-up including Blink 182, Pusha T and Tyga.</p>
      <p>However, all of the acts pulled out, people who arrived in the Bahamas were greeted by disaster relief tents to stay in, and the cuisine promised turned out to be cheese sandwiches in Styrofoam containers.</p>
      <p>While Ja is in the clear, McFarland is serving six years in prison for multiple counts of fraud, including for the failed 2017 festival.</p>
      <p>The entire Fyre Festival disaster is detailed in two documentaries – Hulu’s Fyre Fraud and Netflix’s Fyre, the latter of which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/11/fyre-festival-bottled-water-legend-andy-king-film-reality-show-10171750/">made event planner Andy King a viral star</a> after he revealed he considered giving oral sex in return for Evian.</p>
