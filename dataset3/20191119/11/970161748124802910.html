      <p>Kris Jenner is worried that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> will reveal all the Kardashian and Jenner family secrets during her stint on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! and that opening up could damage <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kim-kardashian/">Kim Kardashian</a> and Kylie Jenner’s brands.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/kardashian-gossip-desperately-need-caitlyn-jenner-im-celebrity-jungle-11078453/">we’re desperate to know all the family’s tea</a>, such as if the campmate has beef with Khloe Kardashian and whether or not Drake is dating Kylie, the momager is secretly panicking that her ex’s time in the jungle could spell disaster.</p>
      <p>‘Ever since Kris found out about Caitlyn’s massive fee she’s getting paid for the jungle, she’s been concerned Caitlyn is being paid to spill secrets about the family,’ a source revealed.</p>
      <p>‘Kris doesn’t care what Caitlyn says about her or their marriage – after all, she had her book and her TV show – but she’s scared and horrified about Caitlyn damaging Kim or Kylie’s brands by telling campmates about their off-screen private lives.’</p>

      <p>The insider added to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/im-a-celebrity/10369188/kris-jenner-scared-caitlyn-spillfamily-secrets/">The Sun</a> that Kris fears that Caitlyn will ‘talk about how awful her life married into the Kardashian family’ to gain ‘sympathy’ after clashing with fellow campmates.</p>

      <p>Last night, Caitlyn, who was married to Kris for 14 years, told the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2019-line-up-suits-up-for-new-series-in-official-photos-11080048/">I’m A Celebrity line-up</a> that the<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caitlyn-jenner-says-kardashians-know-im-celeb-stayed-silent-social-media-11178480/"> Kardashians and Jenners know she’s currently starring on the ITV show</a>.</p>
      <p>‘Yeah, they all know,’ she said, despite the family so far remaining extremely quiet about her appearance on social media.</p>

      <p>James Haskell then admitted he ‘used to’ fancy Caitlyn’s daughter Kendall, saying: ‘I used to have a massive crush on Kendall.’</p>
      <p>‘I think most men on the planet have fancied one of your daughters at some point,’ comedian Andrew Maxwell replied.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-transitioning-after-threatening-to-quit-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-on-day-two-11178492/">the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star then switched the topic to her transition</a>.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She opened up: ‘I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40, I didn’t want to be an old chick but this is the latter 80’s and I never felt like I fitted in anywhere, I was trying to figure myself out, running around town. Cross-dressing running around.’</p>
