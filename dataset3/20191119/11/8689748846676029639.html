      <p>Information reaching us has it that a young man whose identity is yet to be known is in grips of the University of Ghana Security after he was caught allegedly taking pictures and videos of some students.</p>
      <p>The man according to the report, was caught taking a video of other male students in one of the male washrooms at Annex A of the Legon Hall, University of Ghana.</p>

      <p>According to what was gathered, when the said young man was approached by some students who grew suspicious of his actions to unlock his phone so they can verify their claim, he refused to do so drawing more suspicions and attention from other students.</p>
      <p>To avoid him being assaulted by the angry mob whose numbers were increasing by the minute, he was then dragged to the portersâ€™ lodge by some students.</p>
      <p>It is unclear, at the moment, if he is a student of the university or an outsider but per our information, the young man is being interrogated by the University of Ghana Security and will update readers on subsequent happenings.
