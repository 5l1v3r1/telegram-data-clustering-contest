      <h1>NFL Power Rankings for Week 11: Ravens rise in drastic shakeup</h1>

      <p>The time has come for the first true drastic shakeup atop The Post’s weekly NFL Power Rankings.</p>
      <p>Lamar Jackson and the Ravens already had ripped apart two other top-5 teams (New England and Seattle) in their previous three games, but Sunday’s shredding of Houston vaults Baltimore to the top spot in the league, ahead of the one-loss Patriots and 49ers.</p>
      <p>Among a glut of nine teams with records of either 6-4 or 5-5, the Cowboys have moved back into the top 10 with their grabbing of the NFC East lead.</p>
      <p><b>1. Baltimore Ravens, 8-2 (Last week: 4)</b>: The runaway Ravens have won six straight games since opening the season 2-2, their longest streak since 2000. The wondrous Jackson is fourth in the NFL in passer rating and 10th in the league in rushing yards in a potential MVP campaign. Led by Jackson and running back Mark Ingram, Baltimore also is the only team in the league averaging more than 200 yards per game on the ground (203.8), with San Francisco next at just 149.</p>
      <p><b>2. New England Patriots, 9-1 (1): </b>Tom Brady hasn’t been happy with the Patriots’ sluggish offense recently; Julian Edelman threw more touchdown passes this week against Philadelphia than the legendary quarterback did. At least Bill Belichick’s defense still is dominating, with the fewest points and yards per game allowed in the league, but it will be tested this week against Dallas and the league’s top offense (445 yards per game).<br/><b><br/>3. San Francisco 49ers, 9-1 (2):</b> Jimmy Garoppolo and the Niners needed to overcome a 16-point deficit to defeat Arizona, their largest comeback victory since 2011. The next three games against highly ranked Green Bay, Baltimore and New Orleans likely will determine whether San Francisco can hold off Seattle and capture its first NFC West crown since 2012.</p>

      <p><b>4. Seattle Seahawks, 8-2 (3):</b> Pete Carroll’s team had a week off after defeating the 49ers in overtime last Monday night. Jackson’s primary MVP competition, Russell Wilson, should be well-rested for Sunday’s game against the Eagles. He leads the NFL with 23 touchdown passes and a career-best 114.9 passer rating.</p>
      <p><b>5. Green Bay Packers, 8-2 (5): </b>The Packers also are coming off their bye week, and a win Sunday night against the Niners might put them in control of the top seed in the NFC. Like Wilson, Aaron Rodgers has thrown only two interceptions this season. Running back Aaron Jones remains tied with Carolina’s Christian McCaffrey for the league touchdown lead with 14.</p>
      <p><b>6. New Orleans Saints, 8-2 (6):</b> Drew Brees rebounded nicely from a horrific loss the previous week to Atlanta with a strong outing versus Tampa Bay, and the Saints defense also contributed four picks against Jameis Winston. Wide receiver Michael Thomas has the most receptions in NFL history (94) through 10 games, putting him on pace for a league-record 150 with a home game against Carolina up next on Sunday.</p>
      <p><b>7. Minnesota Vikings, 8-3 (7):</b> Kirk Cousins led Minnesota back from a 20-point hole against Denver to stay on the heels of idle Green Bay in the NFC North. The Vikings can move into a first-place tie despite not playing this week, if the Packers lose in San Francisco. Dalvin Cook had only 26 rushing yards against the Broncos, but it put him over 1,000 (1,017) for the first time in his career.<br/><b><br/>8. Kansas City Chiefs, 7-4 (9):</b> The Chiefs would’ve slipped behind Oakland in the AFC West with a loss Monday night to the Chargers in Mexico City, but Patrick Mahomes flipped a third-quarter touchdown pass to Travis Kelce and the K.C. defense picked off Philip Rivers four times — including in the end zone with 18 seconds remaining — in a 24-17 win. Andy Reid’s team gets a week off to prepare for a critical divisional showdown with the Raiders in Week 13 at Arrowhead.</p>
      <p><b>9. Buffalo Bills, 7-3 (10): </b>Josh Allen and the Bills remained in AFC wild-card contention by defeating losing teams all season, including their second win over Miami on Sunday. They need to take care of Denver (3-7) this week, with games against Dallas, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and New England looming the following four weeks. Only the Patriots and the 49ers have allowed fewer points and fewer yards per game this season than Buffalo.<br/><b><br/>10. Dallas Cowboys, 6-4 (11):</b> Dak Prescott, and not Ezekiel Elliott, has emerged as the focal point of Dallas’ top-ranked offense, chucking for a league-high 3,221 yards (a 5,154 pace) with a 104.1 passer rating as the Cowboys have grabbed a one-game lead over the Eagles in the NFC East. Let’s see what Dak can do this week against the Patriots’ vaunted defense, which has allowed just four passing TDs with a league-high 19 interceptions through 10 games.</p>
      <p>11. Oakland Raiders, 6-4 (14)</p>
      <p>12. Houston Texans, 6-4 (8)</p>
      <p>13. Los Angeles Rams, 6-4 (13)</p>

      <p>14. Indianapolis Colts, 6-4 (15)</p>
      <p>15. Philadelphia Eagles, 5-5 (12)</p>
      <p>16. Carolina Panthers, 5-5 (16)</p>
      <p>17. Pittsburgh Steelers, 5-5 (17)</p>
      <p>18. Tennessee Titans, 5-5 (18)</p>
      <p>19. Jacksonville Jaguars, 4-6 (21)</p>
      <p>20. Cleveland Browns, 4-6 (24)</p>
      <p>21. Chicago Bears, 4-6 (19)</p>
      <p>22. Los Angeles Chargers, 4-7 (22)</p>
      <p>23. Detroit Lions, 3-6-1 (20)</p>
      <p>24. Atlanta Falcons, 3-7 (27)</p>
      <p>25. Arizona Cardinals, 3-7-1 (23)</p>
      <p>26. Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 3-7 (25)</p>
      <p>27. Denver Broncos, 3-7 (26)</p>
      <p><b>28. Jets, 3-7 (29):</b> Adam Gase’s offense, fronted by Sam Darnold, has been impressive two weeks in a row, albeit against two teams below the Jets in these esteemed rankings — the Giants and Redskins. Jamal Adams also has backed up all of his chattiness with tremendous safety play. This week’s opponent, Oakland, has won three in a row under Jon Gruden to sneak into the AFC playoff picture.</p>
      <p><b>29. Giants, 2-8 (30):</b> The Giants are back from their bye week following their horrid loss to the Jets, with hot-seated Pat Shurmur hoping rookie QB Daniel Jones and especially banged-up Saquon Barkley can finish strong beginning this week in Chicago.</p>
      <p>30. Miami Dolphins, 2-8 (28)</p>
      <p>31. Washington Redskins, 1-9 (31)</p>
      <p>32. Cincinnati Bengals, 0-10 (32)</p>
