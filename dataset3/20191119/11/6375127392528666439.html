      <h3>THE Philippine National Police Anti-Kidnapping Group (PNP-AKG) yesterday announced the capture of a female Chinese national wanted for her involvement in the kidnapping-for-ransom of a Chinese-Australian citizen inside the Resorts World Casino last May 27.</h3>
      <p>PNP-AKG Officer-in-Charge, Colonel Molave H. Dueñas, identified the suspect as Zhenzhen Cheng, a 28-year-old resident of no. 437-D Tower Shell Residence located at EDSA Road, SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City.</p>
      <p>The official said that the suspect was arrested by a team of AKG Luzon Field Unit operatives led by Major Erving Chan near the City of Dreams in  Parañaque City last Saturday on the strength of a warrant of arrest for kidnapping-for-ransom issued by Judge Restituto Mangalindan Jr. of the Pasay City Regional Trial Court Branch 114.</p>
      <p>No bail was recommended for the temporary liberty of the Chinese woman and her co-accused.</p>
      <p>The PNP-AKG said that their investigation showed that the suspects seized  Jianting Chen, a Chinese-Australian citizen inside the Resorts World Casino last May 27.</p>
      <p>The kidnappers demanded 90,000 RMB from the family of the victim in exchange for his safe release. After the victim’s wife wired the money to a bank account given by the suspects, the victim was released.</p>
      <p>The arrested suspect is now being held at the PNP-AKG lock-up facility in Camp Crame pending the issuance of a commitment order for her by the Pasay court.</p>
