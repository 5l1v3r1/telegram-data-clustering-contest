      <h1>Downs' Incoming Brazilian - Which Foreigner Will Be Offloaded?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:33:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:33</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>With Sundowns’ Brazilian defender, Ricardo Nascimento on the comeback trail after groin surgery and possibly set for involvement in the second half of the season, Pitso Mosimane will have a big decision to make on which of his foreign players to cut loose.</p>
      <p>As Nascimento steps up his rehabilitation after injury, the coach will need to offload one of his five currently registered foreigners in Mauricio Affonso, Gaston Sirino, Jose Ali Meza, Bangaly Soumahoro and Emiliano Tade.</p>
      <p>As reported in Issue 1147, Tade is facing a fight to save his Sundowns career having struggled to maintain his early impact at the club and not having featured at all this season after a knee injury.</p>
      <p>Below are the five foreigners under threat and the case for and against Sundowns offloading them to make space for Nascimento.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Gaston Sirino:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Uruguayan has had a superb start to this season with nine goals and three assists in his 15 appearances so far. Sundowns failed to win either of their last two matches with Sirino missing due to a quad injury. He is a key player for the side and would not be offloaded unless a lengthy ban came his way having recently been charged by the PSL Disciplinary Committee for an ‘assault’ on SuperSport United’s Clayton Daniels and Dean Furman.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mauricio Affonso:</b>
      </p>
      <p>After the 0-0 draw against Baroka, Mosimane told SuperSport TV that Affonso is now one of the side’s most important players. Having scored with his first three shots across their three different competitions, he looks to have a crucial role to play. The coach stated that he was brought in for his height in the CAF Champions League and is unlikely to consider letting him go.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Jose Ali Meza:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having scored just two goals last season – both against weaker opponents in the CAF Champions League preliminary rounds – he looked set to depart on loan to Maritzburg United in the last transfer window. Since then, he has come back into favour and has started six of the last eight matches. He scored against AmaZulu and assisted against Black Leopards, but has been taken off early in recent games. He still needs to prove himself in a Sundowns shirt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bangaly Soumahoro:</b>
      </p>
      <p>With just 17 minutes played last season and only one outing this campaign so far, it does not seem like Sundowns would miss him much, and Nascimento plays in the same central defensive position. The strong form of Mosa Lebusa and Motjeka Madisha this season could also convince Mosimane to potentially let the Ivorian depart.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Emiliano Tade:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The arrival of Affonso and the return to favour of Meza has pushed Tade down the pecking order. Keletso Makgalwa is also back from loan and now fit again after an ankle injury, whilst Tokelo Rantie and Phakamani Mahlambi are also forward options who need game-time. The Argentine scored on his Sundowns debut and had excellent stats for AmaZulu, but the options mean that Tade could be considered surplus to requirements.</p>
