      <p>Wales face Hungary on Tuesday in a crucial final Euro 2020 qualifier (<b><a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/">watch live at 2:45 p.m. ET on ESPN2 in U.S.</a></b>) that could see either team book themselves a berth at next summer's tournament.</p>
      <p>After returning from a full month out injured for Real Madrid (since playing for Wales in the last international break) just in time to start for his country <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=528877">in Saturday's 2-0 win over Azerbaijan</a>, Gareth Bale is relishing the occasion -- especially after being <a href="https://twitter.com/IanMitchelmore/status/1195777635693010944">serenaded with a brand new chant</a> by the Wales fans in Baku at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The travelling supporters showed their support for Bale by singing "Wales, Golf, Madrid" in his direction to the tune of their usual "Viva Gareth Bale" chant -- a reference to recent criticism from former Real winger Predrag Mijatovic, who claimed that to be <a href="https://as.com/futbol/2019/10/29/primera/1572304872_599513.html">the precise order of Bale's sporting priorities at the moment</a>.</p>

      <p>Bale certainly didn't take his chance to refute that claim when speaking to media before the Azerbaijan game last week, when <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/real-madrid/story/3990394/gareth-bale-playing-for-wales-more-exciting-than-real-madrid">he said</a>: "With Wales, I'm speaking my own language and feeling more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement. It's like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday."</p>
      <p>The chant was also echoed by <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWelshDragon9/status/1193933532822982661">similarly pithy banners on show in the away section</a> at the Bakcell Arena.</p>

      <p>The Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23WalesGolfMadrid">#WalesGolfMadrid</a> has taken a battering in the build-up to the Hungary game. And perhaps it is no surprise that <a href="https://cymrueuro2020.bigcartel.com/product/wales-golf-madrid-pre-order">you can order a t-shirt bearing the ordered list on the front</a>.</p>
      <p>In a prematch interview with <a href="https://twitter.com/sgorio/status/1196474490705862656">Sgorio Cymru</a>, Bale was asked whether he'd heard the song.</p>

      <p>"I've heard it, especially when I was on the bench and when I came off, and the boys were laughing," the 30-year-old replied. "It's a good bit of fun."</p>
      <p>That's just as well, as we suspect Bale will be hearing it again (perhaps several times) when he and the rest of the Dragons run out at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p>

      <p>Concocted by Liverpool fans, Robert Firmino's signature tune (based on an old River Plate chant) is one of the most elaborate football chants ever written, <a href="https://genius.com/Liverpool-together-si-senor-lyrics">with the full version boasting three whole verses</a>.</p>

      <p>It's only fitting that N'Golo Kante, the world's favourite player, has a song of his own -- the quintessential version of which was belted out by <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/138860/Paul-Pogba">Paul Pogba</a> and the France squad after their 2018 World Cup triumph.</p>
      <p>All together now: "He's short, he's nice, he stopped Leo Messi..."</p>
