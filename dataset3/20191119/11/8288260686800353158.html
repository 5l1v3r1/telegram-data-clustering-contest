      <h2>Aston Villa latest news | Now Dean Smith's side are back in the Premier League they are a key component of EA Sports' new FIFA 20 game as the top flight takes centre stage</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:41:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:41</time> by <a rel="author">Nathan Bliss, Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Aston Villa fans with a love of the popular EA Sports gaming franchise FIFA will be keen to install the latest update to this year's iteration.</p>
      <p>The game's publishers, Electronic Arts, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/aston-villa-fifa-20-faces-17019851">have released another update to their latest edition today</a> - and this one includes lifelike face scans of Aston Villa's players.</p>
      <p>Jack Grealish is no longer a generic face - his is lifelike now along with fellow players <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-transfer-list-mcginn-17089754">John McGinn</a> , Jota, Anwar El Ghazi, Wesley and Douglas Luiz.</p>
      <p>To use these faces in the popular career mode, though, fans will need to install the update and then start a career - they won't appear in-game in careers already in progress.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The update is due onto the PC version today, and according to popular Twitter account @FIFACareerGems it is hoped that the update will make its way onto consoles within the week.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> fans have had their say on the new face scans on social media.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Here's the pick of the reaction...</i>

      <p>@ <b>BourneyAVFC</b> : This is amazing! Plus Hourihane &amp; Engles have got theirs .... hopefully they have updated Mings, Targett &amp; Heaton from last years!</p>
      <p>@ <b>Villakid01</b> : Has mings got new hair?</p>

        <b>@DAMMcGuffie: The dark days are over!!!</b>
      </p>
      <p>@ <b>J_87d</b> : Yesssw! This is wonderful to see. FINALLY! Been waiting to start a career since release day. To wait 2 months for correct faces is absurd, tbh. Especially when their face scans were done pre-season. (And when half the Leeds or Derby squad have real faces already??!)</p>
      <p>@ <b>lukewoodyy</b> : finally</p>
