      <h1>Students Fume as Technion hosts anti-Israel NGO</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:25:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:25</time> by <a rel="author">BIN staff</a></address>
      <blockquote>Let the wicked fall into their nets while I alone come through. (Psalm 141:10)</blockquote>
      <p>Israel’s prestigious Technion — Israel Institute of Technology has come under fire for hosting four guest lectures featuring members of the controversial NGO Physicians for Human Rights–Israel (PHRI).</p>
      <p>The lectures are being held today (Tuesday) in the framework of a Faculty of Medicine course on integrated systems for fourth-year students.</p>
      <p>PHRI, a recipient of substantial funding from the European Union, United Nations, and New Israel Fund, works to “change discriminatory and abusive structures and policies towards Palestinians in the Occupied Territory.”</p>
      <p>The organization is known for its critical stance on Israel, and its founder and honorary president Dr. Ruchama Marton has <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-bds-is-our-only-lever-against-occupation-apartheid-1.5453430">openly called for BDS</a>.</p>
      <p>During last year’s Great Return March in Gaza in which Hamas terrorists tried to storm the border with Israel, PHRI released a <a href="http://www.phr.org.il/en/wounded-in-the-gaza-strip/">press release</a> accusing Israel of “shoot[ing] unarmed demonstrators.”</p>
      <p>According to the Zionist watchdog group Im Tirtzu, hosting PHRI is an explicit violation of the Council for Higher Education’s ruling to reject the politicization of academia.</p>
      <p>“This is a violation of the Council for Higher Education’s 2011 decision, which clearly states: all attempts of politicizing academia should be rejected,” wrote students in a letter initiated by Im Tirtzu’s Technion branch to the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, Dr. Elon Eisenberg.</p>
      <p>“The Technion, which defines itself as apolitical, is not supposed to give a platform to political organizations, especially not organizations that promote anti-Israel activities,” continued the letter.</p>
      <p>“As Israelis and students that are proud of the Technion, it pains us to think that such an organization is part of our study program, especially in a course that is mandatory.”</p>
      <p>According to Im Tirtzu, the Dean has yet to respond to the letter.</p>
      <p>Yishai Gelem, who studies at the Technion, said he was “shocked to learn that the Technion, which prides itself on being apolitical, would bring such a radical-left organization to give lectures.”</p>
      <p>“And not only that,” added Gelem, “but students are being forced to attend because the lectures are mandatory.”</p>
      <p>Another student, Ofek Dvir, called the lectures “embarrassing.”</p>
      <p>“It is embarrassing for the Technion that such radical anti-Israel organizations are coming to give classes,” said Dvir.</p>
      <p>“We came here to learn, not to be indoctrinated with anti-Israel propaganda,” concluded Dvir.</p>
