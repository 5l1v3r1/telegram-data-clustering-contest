        <b>Now is your chance to solve that old mystery – was your grandfather a hero of the 1916 Rising? Did your grandmother stand up to the Black and Tans? Did your family suffer a Civil War split?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Irish Army is finally ready to answer all those questions and more with a new online service that chronicles Ireland’s military past.</p>
      <p>Back in 2012, the country’s Defence Forces launched a new website at <a href="http://www.militaryarchives.ie/">www.militaryarchives.ie</a>, which offers a fascinating insight into Ireland’s past.</p>
      <p>The information dates back to the formation of the State with some material from the British Army, prior to their departure in 1922, also available online.</p>
      <p>The Army believes the details now available on the website will be invaluable to professional and amateur historians, genealogists, and members of the public keen to trace their family tree.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/irishcentral.com/roots/genealogy">All the information online</a> is also available to the public at the Irish state’s military archives in Dublin’s Cathal Brugha Barracks.</p>
      <p>The Army also published some 36,000 pages of witness statements from key military events that shaped pre-Independence Ireland from 1913-1921.</p>

      <p>Defence Forces spokesman Capt Stephen MacEoin said: “This project will provide a major and never before seen insight into the 1916 Rising and the War of Independence.</p>
      <p>“The documents include some 1,773 statements by men and women who were eye-witnesses to some of the most dramatic events in Irish history.</p>
      <p>“The website will allow Irish people around the world to search for information not just about a family member but also their own parish or county.”</p>
      <p>Capt MacEoin also confirmed to the<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0103/1224309736108.html"> Irish Times</a> that the Military Archives will also release files from those who claim to have fought for Irish freedom. Many of these submissions were made by people as they sought a Free State pension.</p>
      <p>The Army believes the publication of this ‘privately submitted’ information will be "groundbreaking."</p>
      <p>Original maps, plans, and drawings pertaining to the construction and maintenance of military barracks in Ireland from 1830 to 1980 will also be published.</p>
      <p>The online collection also contains many previously unseen architectural drawings from the British War Office, the Royal Engineer Corps, the Ordnance Survey and, latterly, the Irish Defence Forces Engineer Corps.</p>
      <p>Some archive material - including papers relating to Michael Collins – can still only be viewed in person and by agreement with the Military Archives body.</p>
