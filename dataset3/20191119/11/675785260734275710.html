      <h2>Danny Loader has caught the attention of plenty of Premier League clubs at Reading including Man Utd - he had a summer transfer to Wolves fall down</h2>

      <p>Manchester United are keeping an eye on Reading starlet Danny Loader.</p>
      <p>Hot shot striker Loader has turned heads with his performances for Reading in the Championship since making his debut in the Carabao Cup in 2017.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old has netted once in 29 first team appearances for the Royals having progressed through their Berkshire academy.</p>
      <p>United have proved in recent times they aren't afraid to dip into the lower leagues for talent - having picked up Dan James from Swansea this summer.</p>

      <p>Loader is out of contract at the end of the season, with plenty of Premier League interest in him, along with rumours <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> are keen.</p>
      <p>"There are ongoing discussions between the club, him, his agent and his family," said Reading boss Mark Bowen.</p>
      <p>"He is very happy with his football and yes he wants more game time but he is a great professional, has a smile on his face and works hard. That’s all I can ask for.</p>
      <p>"He is a confident lad and has got a talent. At times he will be down but he has to be patient and he will get his chance."</p>

      <p>Loader almost moved to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> in the summer but the transfer fell through on deadline day.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows a Premier League club tried to sign me in the transfer window, but it wasn’t to be," Loader said.</p>
      <p>"I’m very ambitious, my dream is to play on the biggest stage and you never know when these opportunities will come around again.”</p>
      <p>Loader comes with high praise from Red Devils legend Jaap Stam - who handed him his professional debut.</p>
      <p>“He’s a very, very promising player, everybody knows that,” said Stam.</p>
      <p>“When the opportunity is there he trains with us (first team). You can see he’s a killer around the box and his finishing is very clinical.</p>
      <p>“It’s very tempting to take him into the first team but we need to be very careful how he feels.</p>
      <p>“We need to take care of these youngsters but if he keeps on playing how he is then he’s going to be very close to the first-team squad and maybe onto the pitch.”</p>
