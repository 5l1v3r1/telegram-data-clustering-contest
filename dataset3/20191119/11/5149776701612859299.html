      <p>Chef Scott Harrison used to work in a Nottingham's steakhouse - but a £5 wager with another chef led to him turning vegan.</p>
      <p>That was three years ago at Oaks, where steak, burgers and chicken are cooked over an open grill, making it a tough bet.</p>
      <p>But Scott stuck to his word and cut out all meat, fish, cheese and milk from his diet and not just for the seven days of the bet.</p>
      <p>But there was something he really missed - a really good vegan takeaway delivered to the door.</p>
      <p>The craving led to him joining forces with another chef to create vegan kebabs from his home kitchen in Clifton, which has just gained a five star hygiene rating.</p>

      <p>Scott, who currently works as a chef at NotCutts Garden Centre in Edwalton, has teamed up with kitchen manager Robbie Maltby to create The Vegan Takeaway Company.</p>
      <p>So far they've been getting rave reviews - and that's from meat eaters.</p>
      <p>"Often people do say they prefer ours to a regular kebab which is always nice to hear!" said Scott.</p>
      <p>After taking orders all week via social media, they spend Saturdays creating oyster mushroom kebabs wrapped up with salad and sriracha sauce in a giant clay oven naan bread for £6.50.</p>
      <p>The kebabs are made with marinated oyster mushrooms, which are prepared in a way which that they resemble juicy, meaty chunks.</p>
      <p>"They grow in huge clusters. We have 5kg and press them for two and a half hours with a custom-built press to remove the water," said Scott.</p>
      <p>Friends and family help with deliveries within a five mile radius.</p>
      <p>Scott, a qualified personal trainer who used to live off steak, salmon and chicken, found it difficult cooking meat for Oaks' customers at first and got by eating salads.</p>

      <p>"It was pretty tough and I was feeling lightheaded but I went home ban cooked a big chilli with beans and potatoes. Within a month I lost a stone. The hardest thing was giving up<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/sneak-peek-inside-nottinghams-new-3526510"> cheese</a>," said the 24-year-old, who is also an Army reservist chef.</p>
      <p>The change in diet also had an impact on Robbie, 28, who turned vegan a couple of weeks ago.</p>
      <p>At the moment they're selling 20 to 25 a week. "We'd like to do live ordering, taking orders over the phone, as takeaways are often spontaneous.</p>
      <p>"We'd like to expand through Uber Eats and extend the menu," added Scott.</p>
      <p>The duo recently catered for a birthday party, serving vegan burritos, tacos and sushi, and will be trialling markets this month and next, including Leicester market for a second time, on November 30.</p>
      <p>As for the chef that Scott had the bet with... he didn't go the distance.</p>

      <p>"He only lasted a few days mostly because of habits, eating things without thinking whilst working," said Scott.</p>
      <p>Customers are lavishing praise on the food.</p>
      <p>Olly Morrell said: "I'm no <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/greggs-breaks-silence-over-whether-3541900https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/greggs-breaks-silence-over-whether-3541900">vegan</a>, but gave one a try and since I've tried one haven't gone back to meat kebabs. Best kebabs in the area by far. Well balanced and very filling. Definitely rate them."</p>
      <p>Hannah Louise said: "I couldn't believe the size of them, excellent value for money! Not going to lie, bit on the spicy side for me so I couldn't eat it all, my partner loved it though and ate his and the rest of mine! He's asked me when we're going to have them again which for someone who believes a meal isn't a meal without meat is high praise indeed."</p>
      <p>The kebabs can be ordered via Facebook or Instagram.</p>
