      <p>Bandai Namco has announced that season two of noble fighter <i>Soulcalibur VI</i> will begin next week, November 25, on all platforms. The first new roster addition for season two, Hildegard Von Krone (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../soulcalibur-vi-reveals-hilde-will-be-its-next-dlc-fighter-571323.phtml">or just "Hilde" to her buddies</a>) will be made available to purchase the following day on November 26.<br/><br/>A new Japanese overview trailer takes a look at the new features headed to <i>Soulcalibur VI</i> in season two. This includes Hilde herself, and new fight mechanics such as the "Resist Attack" counter and the powerful new "Soul Attack." Of course, you can't throwdown without a battlefield, and season two will be adding new stage "The Sanctuary of Steel Wolves," alongside new training venue "Underground Labyrinth: Sealed Corridor."<br/><br/>But that's not all... Season two will also revamp elements of the<i> Soulcalibur VI</i> UI, add a new chat function to game lobbies, bring about a new selection of customisation items to dress up your homegrown warriors, as well as the usual run of balance tweaks and bug fixes. All in, it's going to be a pretty exciting week on the Stage of History.<br/><br/><i>Soulcalibur VI</i> is available now on PS4, PC and Xbox One.</p>
