      </p>
      <p>The Azzurri trounced Armenia courtesy of goals from Federico Chiesa, Riccardo Orsolini, Jorginho, Alessio Romagnoli, Nicolo Barella, Nicolo Zaniolo and Ciro Immobile, with the latter pairing netting a brace each.</p>
      <p>The result was Italy's biggest win since a 9-0 victory over the United States in 1948, and saw the nation complete their qualification campaign for the 2020 UEFA European Championship with a perfect record of 10 wins from 10.</p>

      </p>
      <p>In doing so, Mancini's charges broke a number of longstanding records, including one for the most wins in a calendar year with 10.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Tribal Football</i>, the record had previously stood at nine wins in a given year, which had been achieved on four occasions by the four-time FIFA World Cup champions, namely in 1990, 1994, 2000 and 2003.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester City boss Mancini has led to his side to 11 consecutive wins stretching back to 2018, bettering the previous record of nine set by Vittorio Pozzo's side across 1938 and 1939.</p>

      <p>Mancini has been at Italy's since May 2018, when he replaced interim manager Luigi Di Biagio, and has won 14 of his 20 matches in charge of the nation.</p>
