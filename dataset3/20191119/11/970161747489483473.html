      <p>A woman who knifed her boyfriend up to 30 times, told her boss in tears: ‘I just couldn’t stop myself – I stabbed him all over’, a court has heard.</p>
      <p>Clare McMahon, 35, claimed John Robinson, 37, stabbed her in the hand with a knife, before she managed to grab the weapon from him.</p>
      <p>She then knifed him in the neck, navel and back during a fight on the second floor balcony of their home in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester on May 23.</p>
      <p>Tests showed Robinson died at the scene from three wounds to his back, including one 12 cm deep cut which severed an artery, and a wound to his throat which cut his windpipe in two.</p>
      <p>McMahon admitted killing Robinson but denies murder, claiming she suffers from a form of ‘complex post-traumatic stress disorder’ due to being in a ‘violent abusive relationship’.</p>

      <p>The labourer rang her boss Daniel McManus, a builder, immediately after the incident, Manchester Crown Court heard.</p>

      <p>Prosecutor Francis McEntee said the pair had known each other for 15 years, having previously been in a relationship and remaining friends ever since.</p>
      <p>He told the court McMahon had appeared ‘fine that day, laughing and joking as usual’ before calling Mr McManus after midnight ‘sounding hysterical’.</p>
      <p>Mr McEntee continued: ‘She was saying something like “I think I’ve killed him, I’ve stabbed him to death”.</p>
      <p>‘She told him she was covered in blood and when he got her to calm down a little, she said that Mr Robinson had stabbed her in the hand and she had taken the knife from him.</p>
      <p>‘She went on to say “I’ve stabbed him, I just couldn’t stop myself”. When asked about where she had stabbed him, she told Mr McManus that she has “stabbed him all over.”</p>
      <p>‘Mr McManus arranged to collect the defendant and will confirm, that when he collected her she seemed very stressed.’</p>

      <p>The prosecutor stated that Mr McManus had been the first person to find Mr Robinson’s body.</p>
      <p>He continued: ‘He could see there was blood in the bed and a bit sprayed up the wall and on the door.</p>
      <p>‘He also say a large silver knife on the bed, which he estimated to be 10 inches long, and a second knife that was black and was about six inches long.</p>
      <p>‘He could see Mr Robinson lying on the floor of the balcony on his back and tried to shake him to see if he could get a response – but he could not.’</p>

      <p>Mr Robinson and McMahon’s had been in a relationship for over three years, but neighbours said they heard them ‘having words with each other’ around once a month.</p>
      <p>During the evening of the incident, witness Lisa Hayes said she saw Mr Robinson pressing McMahon against the railing of their balcony and called out to ask if she was okay.</p>
      <p>There was no reply, and she then saw Mr Robinson standing near the balcony door making a ‘gasping noise’.</p>

      <p>Another neighbour Simon Hilton heard the argument coming from the balcony and saw the pair struggling, before asking McMahon: ‘What’s he done now?’, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Mr McEntee told the court she replied: ‘I’ve stabbed him, Si’, before Mr Hilton realised the couple were covered in blood.</p>
      <p>McMahon dialled 999 herself, telling the call handler: ‘I stabbed him, I need the police, I need everything, he’s attacked me as well’.</p>
      <p>The handler asked if Mr Robinson was breathing, to which McMahon responded: ‘Just a little bit, no I think he’s gone’ before the call was disconnected.</p>
      <p>McMahon was later arrested while she was sat in Mr McManus’ van and a knife was found on a concrete path below the balcony.</p>
      <p>The prosecution told the court that the evidence painted a picture of ‘fully extensive assault’ and suggested McMahon was using more than one knife.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Mr McEntee said: ‘She will contend that she had lost control and that her loss of control was due to the fear of serious violence from John Robinson.</p>
      <p>‘We say that, having inflicted a life ending injury to Mr Robinson’s throat, the defendant chose to select a further weapon to continue to deliver further devastating stab wounds.</p>
      <p>‘It was a sustained and determined attack.’</p>
      <p>
