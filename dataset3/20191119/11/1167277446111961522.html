      <p>Five new hotels were included on the controversial list of banned Cuban companies and institutions for US citizens by the government of President Donald Trump.</p>

      <p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Friday that the list, first published in November 2017 as part of the Trump administration’s measures to limit Cuba’s trade and US citizens’ travel, would be updated again.</p>
      <p>As of Tuesday, and as has happened with more than 200 Cuban companies and institutions, US citizens are banned from undertaking direct financial transactions with the Gran Hotel Bristol Kempinski, in Havana; and Grand Aston Varadero Resort, at the world famous coastal resort in Matanzas province.</p>
      <p>US citizens likewise cannot stay at the Grand Aston Cayo Las Brujas Beach Resort and Spa, the Gran Muthu Imperial Hotel and the Gran Muthu Rainbow Hotel, in the Jardines del Rey archipelago.</p>
      <p>This is the fifth time that the US government has updated the list to include new firms, as it previously did so in November 2018, and March, April and July 2019.</p>
      <p>Cuba has described the list as arbitrary, as it is made up of a wide range of structures allegedly linked to the national defense and security sectors. <i>(Taken from Prensa Latina)</i></p>
