      <h1>Didi Hamann claims Ireland didn't do enough to warrant Euro 2020 spot with qualifying performances</h1>
      <h2>Fellow pundits Liam Brady and Richie Sadlier gushed over last night's 1-1 draw with Denmark</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:24:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/donagh-corby/" target="_blank">Donagh Corby</a></address>
      <p>Ireland weren't good enough to qualify for Euro 2020, according to RTE analyst and legendary midfielder <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dietmar-hamann">Dietmar Hamann</a>.</p>
      <p>Fellow pundits <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liam-brady">Liam Brady</a> and Richie Sadlier gushed over last night's 1-1 draw with Denmark, that saw Mick McCarthy's men come within inches of automatic qualification.</p>
      <p>However, McCarthy admitted after the game that lack of goals was an issue, which Hamann echoed on RTE's post-match coverage.</p>
      <p>He said: “I don’t think there’s any doubt that this has been the best performance in the whole qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>“I don't buy into the idea that 'if we’d played like this in the two years or 18 months before [we'd have qualified]', because if you look at the whole qualifying campaign, they played eight games and scored seven goals.</p>

      <p>"They didn’t get what they deserved tonight but over the whole qualifying campaign, I don’t think the team did enough to warrant a place in the finals."</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy's men were buoyed on by a raucous crowd at the Aviva Stadium, and looked to be the better side for a good portion of the first half.</p>
      <p>They started even better for the second, but couldn't put away a number of chances.</p>
      <p>And when Martin Braithewaite broke free of the Irish defence after 73 minutes to touch home Henrik Dalsgaard's cross that came back to haunt them.</p>
      <p>Despite a late onslaught towards the Danish goal, that did yield an equaliser through Matt Doherty, Ireland couldn't find their way to the two necessary goals needed to earn an automatic spot at the Euros, and now head for the qualifiers.</p>
