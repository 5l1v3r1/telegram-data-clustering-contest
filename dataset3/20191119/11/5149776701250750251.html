      <p>Nottingham Forest’s City Ground redevelopment project could provide a bumper boost to the local economy, as well as creating a considerable number of jobs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-reveal-amazing-new-3540790">Fresh images of the proposed transformation</a> of the Reds’ home were revealed as the plans went to public consultation.</p>
      <p>With a planning application expected to be submitted before the end of the year, work would then be due to get underway in 2020 should permission be granted.</p>
      <p>And the benefit to the local area could prove significant.</p>
      <p>The construction phase could lead to as many as 1,200 jobs, with the club and owner <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/evangelos-marinakis">Evangelos Marinakis</a> keen to see many of those created locally - both on the project and in the supply chain.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a>’s advisers, even should they remain in the Championship, post-construction the redevelopment could lead to the club generating 1,150 net additional jobs.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the 10-year projection for impact on the local economy could be an incredible £0.6 billion - with the potential for that to double should promotion to the Premier League be achieved.</p>
      <p>“There’s two parts to the job creation,” said Tom Cartledge, lead architect and CEO of Benoy, the architectural firm behind the multi-million pound project.</p>

      <p>“One is around the construction. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3541842">This is a significant piece of construction</a> - there aren’t many £50m projects in Nottingham at any one time.</p>
      <p>“This is one which will require a myriad of different trades. There’s engineering, there’s steel, there’s data, there’s fit-out and everything else.</p>
      <p>“We’re a Nottingham business and other Nottingham businesses are part of the team as well. Right from the start Mr Marinakis said, ‘try to encourage as much of that to be done in the city as possible’.</p>
      <p>“There is a significant number of employment opportunities during the construction period.</p>
      <p>“And then if we look at the facilities going forward, there are lounges for 600 or 700 people, which we want to be using on matchdays and non-matchdays. They require catering, booking, service staff and facilities management.</p>
      <p>“When you take a stadium from what at the moment is a 20 or 30 days a year activity and turn it into something which could be 100 or 200 days of use, inevitably you bring forward a number of job opportunities.</p>
      <p>“Obviously as well, if we dream ahead and think that Arsenal, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and others are coming here, they are participating in the local economy. They will potentially be wanting to stay longer and spend more in our city.</p>
      <p>“And so the secondary effect of an enhanced stadium, if we get it right on the pitch as well, is those secondary jobs in local businesses, which is absolutely paramount.”</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/gallery/nottingham-forests-vision-world-class-2592827">A rebuilt Peter Taylor Stand</a>
      </p>
      <p>will be brought up to a capacity of 10,000 fans, with new state of the art dressing rooms, a museum, club shop, executive boxes and media suites also included.</p>
      <p>There are plans to extend the Bridgford Stand too, as well as make improvements to the other sides of the ground in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3541269">a timeframe which is hoped will be 15 months</a> from start to finish.</p>
      <p>And making the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/city-ground">City Ground</a> a focus for the community is central to the project.</p>
      <p>“I think the other thing to mention is the long-term community potential here,” added Cartledge.</p>
      <p>“The club is working really hard already with a number of local community groups.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying this is the community’s youth centre, but neither should it be a locked away, only-go-on-a-matchday facility.</p>
      <p>“The club and the owner and the senior team here are very much looking forward to not just businesses using it during the week, but what facilities can the community get from here? Is this a place where they can meet? Are there groups and clubs and other things which aren’t just revenue-generating, they are actually <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/tears-nottingham-forest-fans-react-3542152">pride things for the people of Nottingham?”</a></p>
