      <p>WATERVAL BOVEN – A resident shot and killed a housebreaker in the early hours of Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>According to Brig Leonard Hlathi, the resident’s son woke him at about 03:00 on Saturday after the alarm at the property next door went off.</p>
      <p>The son said there were lights being switched on and off in the house, which was standing empty since the owner had died.</p>
      <p>A security officer from JHD Security Services, who wishes to remain anonymous, responded to the alarm call and noticed nothing out of the ordinary from outside.</p>
      <p>“The alarm sounded again after I had checked the house, so I went to fetch the keys from the caretaker,” he told Lowvelder.</p>

      <p>Upon arriving back at the property, the resident met the officer outside and told him that he would accompany him on a search of the house.</p>
      <p>The resident was armed and the security officer, who is still in the process of qualifying for his firearm competency certificate, was armed with pepper spray and wearing a bulletproof vest.</p>
      <p>They entered the house and started to move into the kitchen and the living room respectively when a man attacked the resident with a screwdriver and knife. The resident shot and killed the man.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that the housebreaker was recently released from prison and had multiple charges against him for theft and also a charge of rape.</p>
      <p>Both the security officer and resident reported the incident to the Waterval Boven Police Station and an inquest was opened.</p>
      <p>Lowvelder tried to contact JHD Security Services’ control room, but the number was unavailable.</p>
