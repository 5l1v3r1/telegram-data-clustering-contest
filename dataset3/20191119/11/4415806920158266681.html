      <p>Hollywood actor, Kevin Dillon has backed the campaign to improve chemotherapy services at University Hospital Kerry.</p>
      <p>Comfort for Chemo Kerry is working with the HSE to enhance the services and Fianna Fail Councillor Mikey Sheehy, who survived cancer himself, is among those behind the charity.</p>
      <p>Dillion met Kevin Dillon, better known as Johnny Drama in the hit TV show Entourage, in 2013 when he and his brother Tim joined him for a round of golf in Tralee Golf Course.</p>
      <p>They’ve remained great friends since.</p>
      <p>Dillon recorded a 35-second video urging people to support the charity.</p>
      <p>“Hello all my friends in Ireland and the Kingdom of Kerry, especially to my good buddy Mikey Sheehy, who’s also a cancer survivor,” he said.</p>
      <blockquote>We all have friends and family who have been affected by cancer and that’s why we all need to support Comfort for Chemo</blockquote>
      <p>“So everyone, dig into your pockets and do what you can to support this cause. A great cause”</p>
