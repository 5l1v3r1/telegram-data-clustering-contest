      <p>The finalists of the first series of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rupauls-drag-race-uk"><i>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</i></a> have been captured by esteemed <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fashion">fashion</a> photographer <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rankin">Rankin</a> in an elegant <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/photo-shoot">photo shoot</a>.</p>
      <p>Over the past eight weeks, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/drag-queens">drag queens</a> The Vivienne, Divina de Campo and Baga Chipz have been put to the test by television personality <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rupaul">RuPaul</a> to determine who should be named the UK’s first Drag Race Superstar.</p>
      <p>On Thursday evening on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/BBC_Three"><i>BBC Three</i></a>, the nation will discover who is to receive the coveted crown, as well as the opportunity to star in their own series in Hollywood.</p>
      <p>Prior to the grand finale, the three finalists have appeared in a glamorous photo shoot, which is featured in the latest issue of <i>Grazia </i>magazine.</p>
      <p>The queens each don their own signature style of drag in the photo shoot; <a href="https://www.instagram.com/divinadecampo/?hl=en">Divina</a> in her recognisable red wig and tiara, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thevivienne_/?hl=en">The Vivienne</a> in a femme fatale-esque ensemble and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bagachipz/?hl=en">Baga</a> with bouffant blonde hair and “Queen” gold hoops.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <i>Grazia</i>, Divina said she disliked the competitive nature of the show.</p>
      <p>“You have to put yourself into positions that make you uncomfortable. It took me out of my box, completely,” she said.</p>
      <p>The Vivienne described the television series as “the <i>Dragon’s Den</i> of drag queens”, summarising the experience by saying: “You go in, you pitch what you’re good at, then hopefully the world falls in love with you.”</p>
      <p>The drag queen added the UK version of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/rupauls-drag-race"><i>RuPaul’s Drag Race</i></a> appears to be a “lot friendlier” than the original American show.</p>
      <p>Baga said that her experience in the competition has made her “more professional” as a drag queen.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, it was announced that <i>RuPaul’s Drag Race UK</i> will be returning for a second season.</p>
