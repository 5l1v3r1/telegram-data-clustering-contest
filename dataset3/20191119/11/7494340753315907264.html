      <h1>Some Fitbit Users Say They're Getting Rid of the Devices Because They Don't Trust Google</h1>

      <p>The trend of people <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/17/people-getting-rid-of-fitbits-after-google.html">throwing or threatening to throw out their Fitbit devices comes as Google faces a perception problem</a> that has spanned everyday users and regulators alike. From a report:<i> The company has paid data privacy fines in the EU and made recent strides into the stringently regulated healthcare industry, which has caused the public to re-think seemingly harmless tools. Privacy groups this week began pushing regulators to block the Fitbit acquisition, which the company originally hoped to close in early 2020. Google didn't respond to requests for comment. "I only recently got it and now I'm thinking I don't need Google watching literally my every step or my every heart beat," said Dan Kleinman, who said he is getting rid of his Fitbit Versa. Some people cited Google's 2014 acquisition of Nest Labs, which, at the time consisted of smart home thermostats. Since then, the company has tied Nest's technology, branding and device accounts to its digital assistant and smart speakers. Twitter users have been tweeting about their plans to get rid of their devices upon <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/11/01/1345229/google-purchases-fitbit-for-21-billion">hearing of the acquisition</a>.</i></p>
