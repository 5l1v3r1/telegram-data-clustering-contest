      </p>
      <h3>Looking up</h3>
      <p><b>Baker Mayfield QB, Browns</b><br/>Combined averages of defenses he has faced have allowed 7.3 fantasy points fewer per week than the combined teams remaining on his schedule. Dolphins this week should be a nice kick-start to a strong stretch run.</p>
      <p><b>Sam Darnold QB, Jets</b><br/>Similarly, Darnold’s next three games are against defenses 7.4 points nicer per week than those the Jets already have faced. But make sure you have an alternative available for Weeks 15-17, when his schedule gets difficult again.<br/><b><br/>Derrius Guice RB, Redskins</b><br/>Only the Chiefs give up more fantasy points to running backs than Guice’s next opponent, the Lions. The Panthers and Packers follow, neither of which are tough on RBs.</p>
      <p><b>Hunter Renfrow WR, Raiders</b><br/>Could be a sneaky play this week against a bad Jets secondary.</p>
      <h3>Heading down</h3>
      <p><b>Josh Allen QB, Bills</b><br/>The only plus matchup remaining on his schedule is a Week 17 game against the Jets. And hopefully your league doesn’t do the disservice of playing in Week 17.<br/><b><br/>Carlos Hyde RB, Texans</b><br/>A bad game bailed out by a late TD on Sunday, after a monster 160-yard outing against the Jaguars in the Texans’ previous game. Don’t be fooled. No great matchups remain, with Colts and Patriots the next two weeks and Buccaneers in Week 16 title week.</p>
      <p><b>Brian Hill RB, Falcons</b><br/>Managed just 2.0 yards per carry against the weak Panthers run defense Sunday. The stiff Buccaneers and Saints follow, then the Panthers again, then the 49ers. Ugly.</p>
      <p><b>Jason Witten TE, Cowboys</b><br/>He has more games in single digits this season than double-digits. Four of the next five weeks present less-than-ideal matchups.</p>
