      <h1>Brooklyn man sentenced to 18 months in prison after running fraudulent ICOs</h1>

      <p>A man in the US has been sentenced to 18 months in prison after running two illegal cryptocurrency Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).</p>
      <p>Accused of committing securities fraud, Brooklyn-based Maksim Zaslavskiy was sentenced by United States District Judge Raymond J. Dearie yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Zaslavskiy committed old-fashioned fraud camouflaged as cutting-edge technology,” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/brooklyn-businessman-sentenced-18-months-imprisonment-defrauding-investors">stated United States Attorney Donoghue</a>.</p>
      <p>“This Office will continue to investigate and prosecute those who defraud investors, whether involving traditional securities or virtual currency,” Donoghue added.</p>
      <p>Back in July 2017, Zaslavskiy marketed RECoin as “the first-ever cryptocurrency backed by real estate,” and Diamond as an “exclusive and tokenized membership pool” backed by diamonds.</p>
      <p>In reality, however, Zaslavskiy purchased neither diamonds nor real estate and the certificates he sent to investors were fake.</p>
      <p>He also falsely advertised that REcoin had a “team of lawyers, professionals, brokers and accountants” who would invest the proceeds from the REcoin ICO in real estate. He also claimed to have sold 2.8 million REcoin tokens.</p>
      <p>“The calculated lies of Zaslavskiy and others led unsuspecting investors who thought they were purchasing cryptocurrency securities to buy worthless certificates,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue after Zaslavskiy <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/brooklyn-businessman-pleads-guilty-defrauding-investors-through-two-initial-coin">entered his guilty plea</a> in November last year.</p>
