      <h3>Hello Kitty History</h3>
      <p>In Japan, Hello Kitty is described as a <i>gijinka</i> - an anthropomorphic 'non-human' with human traits.</p>
      <p>Described as a 'symbol of happiness, kindness and friendship', Hello Kitty was first created by Japanese designed Yuko Shimizu in 1974.</p>
      <p>The now infamous character first appeared on a vinyl coin purse and within two years made it's first appearance in the United States.</p>
      <p>Originally marketed towards a child and preteen audience, Hello Kitty broadened its appeal to cater towards a more mature audience.</p>
      <p>By 1999, Hello Kitty appeared on 12,000 different products yearly. Throughout the early noughties and up to 2008, that number increased to over 50,000 different branded products in over 60 countries across the world.</p>
      <p>This year, 2019, Hello Kitty is said to be the second highest-grossing franchise of all time behind Pokemon. Throughout it's history, it's sales are said to have totalled somewhere in the region of £75bn.</p>
