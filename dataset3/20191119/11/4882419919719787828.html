      <p>Robert Moreno was surprised, hurt and angry on Monday as he spent his final few hours as Spain coach, pending the official announcement which should come on Tuesday. Not because he won't be on the bench for Euro 2020, or about who will replace him, but for the way things have happened.</p>
      <p>The Catalan coach is really upset with RFEF president Luis Rubiales and with Luis Enrique, his friend and boss for many years. His anger also extends to Jose Francisco Morina, the RFEF's sporting director.</p>
      <p>It was Molina who, after a week of speculation, gave Robert Moreno the confirmation that he would be replaced at the Wanda Metropolitano after Spain's 5-0 win over Romania, practically in the presence of the players and after a press conference the day before when the coach had shown his desire to continue. Robert didn't have the energy to then speak to the media and didn't show for his postgame press conference.</p>
      <p>Moreno feels he has been poorly treated because the situation has been managed behind his back. The coach was put on alert following a number of reports during the week, with Rubiales avoiding communication during the last few days. Robert's public messages about wanting to be in charge for next summer's finals fell on death ears at the RFEF.</p>
      <p>It was Molina who tried to 'control the damage' until after the games against Malta and Romania, but the media got ahead of the game after Rubiales refused to commit.</p>
      <p>To cap this surreal situation, it remains unknown how the relationship between Moreno and Luis Enrique is now. Remember that when Robert took over from Luis Enrique, who left the job due to the illness and subsequent death of his daughter, he said that he would be ready to step aside the day the former Barcelona coach wanted to return.</p>
      <p>The journalist Luis Lainz said on Radio Marca that Luis Enrique asked Rubiales for Moreno to not be his No.2 during his second spell in charge of La Roja, a role in principle destined to be filled by Juan Carlos Unzue.</p>
