      <h1>Celtic receive ticket boost for Rangers final as extra Betfred Cup allocation released</h1>
      <h2>Fans who are drawn in a ballot will have the opportunity to snap up a place at the Hampden clash.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:20:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic have received a small batch of extra tickets for the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/betfred-league-cup">Betfred Cup</a> Final showdown against <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> .</p>
      <p>The current holders will square off against their bitter Ibrox rivals at Hampden on December 8 with the first major trophy of the campaign up for grabs.</p>
      <p>It's expected the showpiece clash will be a sell-out, but an extra allocation will be balloted among select Celtic fans.</p>
      <p>Supporters who were eligible in the original sale but did not strike gold may get a second chance, provided they are on the club's tickets scheme, purchased briefs for previous rounds against Dunfermline, Partick Thistle and Hibs and, of course, are chosen through the ballot.</p>
      <p>Lucky punters have until 3pm on Saturday, November 23 to secure their place at the national stadium for next month's fixture.</p>

      <p>However, the club concede the extra allocation will still be unable to meet the incredible demand, with not enough places to satisfy all eligible fans.</p>
      <p>A statement on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> 's website said: "Unfortunately, we still do not have a sufficient allocation to offer all season ticket holders who meet this criteria a ticket for this match, and we appreciate the disappointment this may cause. <br/><br/>"We fully understand that the allocation of tickets we have been given will not be able to satisfy the demand from supporters wishing to attend the match.</p>
      <p>"We also fully accept that many supporters will be disappointed.</p>
      <p>"However, we would ask fans to understand and appreciate that this is a difficult process for the club to administer, given the ticket allocation provided."</p>
