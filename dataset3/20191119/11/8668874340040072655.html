      <h1>New Wales coach Wayne Pivac names his first squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:35:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:35</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>New <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/wales">Wales</a> coach Wayne Pivac has named a 35-man squad to prepare for his first fixture in charge against the Barbarians at Principality Stadium on November 30.</p>
      <p>Wales face the BaaBaas as part of a double-header with Wales women and Pivac has selected a squad that includes 22 players who featured at the recent World Cup as well as five uncapped players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/six-major-issues-on-wayne-pivacs-wales-to-do-list/">The game isn’t a capped international</a> but <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/gwent-dragons/players/taine-basham/">Taine Basham</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/cardiff-blues/players/shane-lewis-hughes/">Shane Lewis-Hughes</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/cardiff-blues/players/willis-halaholo/">Willis Halaholo</a>, <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/gwent-dragons/players/ashton-hewitt/">Ashton Hewitt</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/pro-14/teams/scarlets/players/johnny-mcnicholl/">Johnny McNicholl</a> will all hope to pull on the red national jersey for the first time.</p>
      <p>“It is great to get the squad announced and get the ball rolling on our first meet-up and first fixture next week,” said Pivac, who has taken over from fellow Kiwi Warren Gatland after his twelve-year stint in charge.</p>
      <p>“This Barbarians game is a great chance for us as a new squad and management to get together and to set the scene for what we are looking to do. Having this opportunity ahead of tournament rugby in the <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations">Six Nations</a> is ideal for us.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“It is also a great chance for some players to really put their hand up and show what they are about and take to the field in front of a big crowd at home.</p>
      <p>“We will be bringing a few additional players in to train with the squad during the week, just to see them in the environment and will also be bringing some of the injured players in for some of the scene-setting style sessions.”</p>
