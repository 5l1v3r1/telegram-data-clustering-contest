      <p>Kyle Morris, 22, lost his temper and stormed out of a probation service meeting in Telford town centre – which he was required to attend after he admitted four offences of arson between June 24 and 26, 2017.</p>
      <p>A previous court hearing heard how he demanded his mother buy him a new bike so he could sell it and use the money to buy alcohol.</p>
      <p>When she refused, he sent her a string of threatening and abusive texts, including saying he would burn her house down.</p>
      <p>She notified police. Morris was arrested and remained in custody from August 5, the date of the offence, until his sentencing.</p>
      <p>Morris, of Bembridge in Brookside, Telford, admitted threatening to damage and destroy property.</p>
      <p>Mr Brendan Reedy, defending Morris, admitted: “He lost his self control.”</p>
      <p>Judge Peter Barrie told Morris: “You have had a long time in custody to reflect on what you have done.</p>
      <p>“You behaved very badly to your mother. It has been a long pattern of difficult behaviour.”</p>
      <p>He sentenced Morris to a 12-month community order with 30 days rehabilitation requirement.</p>
