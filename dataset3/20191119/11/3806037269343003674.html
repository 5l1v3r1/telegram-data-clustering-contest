      <h1>Watch Kanye West’s Sunday Service With Joel Osteen</h1>
      <h2>Including live performances off ‘Jesus Is King.’</h2>

      <p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> brought his <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/sunday-service">Sunday Service</a> to pastor <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/joel-osteen">Joel Osteen</a>‘s Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas marking the multi-hyphenate’s largest audience to date.</p>
      <p>During West’s appearance, the artist used some of his time on stage to defend the megachurch head who has come under fire in recent years for his prosperity gospel teachings and for not making his place of worship available for Hurricane Harvey victims. “There’s a lot of people in the Christian community that try to give Joel a hard time because when you turn on the radio, he just keeps telling you how good God is,” Kanye said. “That’s good, I love that. When you got Kanye defending you, you made it,” Osteen replied the endorsement.</p>

      <p>West went on to condemn the music industry citing, “The Devil stole all the good producers. The Devil stole all the good musicians, all the good artists, all the good designers, all the good business people, and said, ‘You gotta come over and work for me.’ And now, the trend, the shift is going to change. Jesus has won the victory.” He added, “Now, the greatest artist God has ever created is now working for him.”</p>
      <p>West and his choir also performed songs from <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/jesus-is-king"><i>Jesus Is King</i></a>, such as “God Is” and “Follow God,” as well as secular-turned-gospel songs such as Destiny’s Child’s “Say My Name” and A$AP Ferg’s “New Level.” Check it out above.</p>
