      <h1>Galaxy Note 10 One UI 2.0 beta program no longer open for registrations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:28:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:28</time> by <a rel="author">Abhijeet M.</a></address>
      <p>It was revealed a few days back that Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-android-10-release-one-ui-2-0-beta-closed-korea/">would stop taking registrations</a> for the Galaxy S10 One UI 2.0 beta program starting this week, and the company has now stopped taking registrations for the <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/galaxy-note-10/">Galaxy Note 10</a> beta as well. Samsung’s beta team <a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-S/%EC%95%88%EB%93%9C%EB%A1%9C%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-10-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EB%AA%A8%EC%A7%91%EA%B8%B0%EA%B0%84-%EC%A2%85%EB%A3%8C%ED%9B%84-%EC%8B%A0%EC%B2%AD/m-p/2763022#M325917">revealed</a> this in the Samsung Community forums in Korea, just a day after both the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy S10 <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-note-10-android-10-beta-update-now-rolling-out/">received new</a> <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/third-android-10-beta-update-released-for-the-galaxy-s10-series/">Android 10 beta updates</a>.</p>
      <p>Is this a sign that the stable Android 10 release is almost ready? Well, it’s most certainly a sign that Samsung has tested the new software enough that it doesn’t need more beta participants. But just how quickly the stable update will arrive depends on whether the latest beta builds available for both the S10 and Note 10 lineups are free of problems.</p>
      <p>Samsung could continue releasing more beta updates to those who have already joined the One UI 2.0 beta program, but there’s no way to tell unless the company makes an official announcement. All we know is that Samsung is <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/google-samsung-will-release-stable-android-10-update-by-end-of-year/">hoping to release the stable Android 10 update</a> to some of its devices before 2020, and considering there’s still nearly a month and a half left for the year to end, it should find that target easy to meet.</p>
