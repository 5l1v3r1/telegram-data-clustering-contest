      <p>The curfew in the Red Sea city, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/sudan.html">Sudan</a>'s main economic hub, came into effect at 5:00pm local time (15:00 GMT) and would remain until 5:00am local time (03:00 GMT) on Tuesday, the police said in a statement posted on its Facebook page.</p>
      <p>It did not specify when the restrictions would be lifted.</p>
      <p>Violence erupted when a prominent leader from Beni Amer tribe, Amin Daoud, held a political rally in the city which was opposed by members of Hadendowa tribe, the biggest in eastern Sudan, witnesses told AFP news agency by telephone.</p>
      <p>"Tribal clashes killed three people and wounded 24 others," a doctors committee close to Sudan's umbrella protest movement, Forces of Freedom and Change, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The committee did not specify the exact causes of the deaths and wounds.</p>
      <p>A witness said earlier on Monday that a bus was set on fire during the clashes that erupted near a hospital in central Port Sudan.</p>
      <p>"The clashes stopped after members of the Rapid Support Force [RSF] intervened," another witness said.</p>
      <p>"The situation is still tense and RSF members are everywhere."</p>
      <p>Tribal clashes have often rocked the country, with many resulting in deaths.</p>
      <p>Port Sudan also witnesses regular strikes by port workers demanding better work conditions and pay.</p>
