      <p>Santa Dash-ers can rest easy about transport as Arriva is getting in the Christmas spirit by offering free bus travel once again.</p>
      <p>This <b>Sunday, December 1</b> , Arriva is offering free bus travel to all those taking part in the festive 5k.</p>
      <p>The city centre will soon be taken over by red and blue Santas as the annual run takes place - but anyone travelling to and from the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/santa-dash">Santa Dash</a> can get free bus travel.</p>
      <p>To claim the complimentary travel service, passengers boarding the bus must have their Santa suit and race number on show - or their finisher’s medal after the event.</p>
