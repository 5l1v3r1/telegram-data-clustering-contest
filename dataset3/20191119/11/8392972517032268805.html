      <p>Dermot O'Leary has recalled the moment daytime TV favourite <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/eamonn-holmes/">Eamonn Holmes</a> left him shocked by walking off a Channel 4 show in the middle of filming.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/x-factor/">X Factor</a> presenter, 46, spoke about the odd incident on the podcast Out To Lunch and said it happened while recording for an episode of The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Dermot was on the programme with the <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> host and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/reality-tv/love-island/">Love Island</a>'s Caroline Flack, as well as reality star Ovie Soko and rapper Anderson Paak.</p>

      <p>As reported by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/eamonn-holmes-walked-filming-chat-show-taking-long-record-11176505/">Metro</a>, he explained: "Eamonn Holmes was with us, and the recording's quite long, and Eamonn just, sort of... about three-quarters of the way through, went, 'I've got to be up in the morning, I'm not having this' and he just wasn't there when we came back.</p>
      <p>"Yes, he just went. But, I mean, he said, 'How much longer is this going to go on for?' I said, 'Well, I think it's the third or fourth part now'. He said, 'Oh, no. No, no' and he just... it wasn't announced, it was just literally, like, he wasn't on the couch."</p>

      <p>Eamonn, 59, has been a staple of British daytime telly for close to 30 years, so it might come as no surprise he likes to do things his own way.</p>
      <p>He's best known today for presenting This Morning with his wife <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ruth-langsford/">Ruth Langsford</a>, 59, on Fridays when regular hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> take the day off.</p>
      <p>He often likes to spice up his laid-back presenting style with crude jokes that leave those around him - often, Ruth - red faced and cringing.</p>

      <p>Just recently, he <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/eamonn-holmes/eamonn-holmes-cracks-crude-joke-on-this-morning/">quipped that he was in for a "fun night" with his wife</a> after showering her with compliments.</p>
      <p>The pair were introducing the segments on an episode last week (15.11.19) when they heard the song You're Beautiful by James Blunt, who was due to perform in the studio.</p>
      <aside>I've got to be up in the morning, I'm not having this.</aside>
      <p>Eamonn said: "It is true you are beautiful, I said play that one for my Ruth. I did, darling."</p>
      <p>Turning to This Morning agony aunt Deidre Sanders, he continued: "That's good advice. I give you good advice on that one, yeah."</p>
      <p>Ruth sat smiling as Eamonn pressed on: "It'll be Friday fun night now, after that..."</p>
      <p>Eamonn has also proved that he's not afraid to push his luck with rude jokes even when his teenage son's within earshot.</p>

      <p>During an episode in August, he left 17-year-old Jack cringing when he <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/eamonn-holmes-horrifies-son-jack-with-sex-joke-as-he-joins-parents-on-this-morning/">joked about enjoying a bit of "cheeky toast" with Ruth</a> in the morning before breakfast.</p>
