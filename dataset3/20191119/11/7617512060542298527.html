      <p>The ferry that runs between Swartz Bay and Fulford Harbour on Salt Spring Island is running late Tuesday.</p>
      <p>B.C. Ferries vessel the Queen of Cumberland is operating 36 minutes behind schedule because it took extra time to load vehicles.</p>
      <p>B.C. Ferries is also warning travellers that today could be a busy travel day on ferries going between Vancouver Island and Vancouver due to WE DAY, a popular event being held at Rogers Arena.</p>
