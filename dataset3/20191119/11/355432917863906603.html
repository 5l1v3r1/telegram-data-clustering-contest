      <h1>South Dakota governor doubles down on 'meth, we're on it' anti-drug campaign</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:56:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/tess-bonn" target="_blank">Tess Bonn</a></address>
      <p>South Dakota Gov. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kristi-noem">Kristi Noem</a> (R) is defending the state’s launch of an anti-drug campaign with the slogan “Meth, we’re on it.”</p>
      <p>The tagline drew a mix of criticism and ridicule across Twitter on Monday, but Noem cited the backlash as proof that efforts to raise awareness around South Dakota's methamphetamine crisis was, in fact, working. </p>
      <p>“Meth is IN SD. Twitter can make a joke of it, but when it comes down to it - Meth is a serious problem in SD. We are here to Get. It. OUT,” Noem tweeted Monday night.</p>
      <p>Noem later tweeted that the state’s meth epidemic “needs to be a dinner table conversation,” adding “we need everyone on it.”</p>
      <p>The campaign, which includes both digital and TV ads, cost the state roughly $449,000, <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/18/gov-kristi-noem-launches-anti-meth-campaign-meth-were-it/4227949002/?fbclid=IwAR2FxkBVSkquZsjMJBTKjoHvL8spTlk6N8WANLTQRL9FruWfvZtDYD0ohHw">according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader</a>.</p>
      <p>One campaign video featured a series of South Dakotans —  including both adults and children — declaring, “I’m on meth.” The video, as well as photos of people with the tagline, prompted some Twitter users to argue that the promotional material made it look as if those featured in the campaign were on the drug themselves.</p>
      <p>“South Dakota: if we were any higher, we’d be North Dakota,” <a href="https://twitter.com/speedius/status/1196535673890557953?s=20">one user quipped</a>.</p>
      <p>Another wondered why the state bothered to trademark the tagline in the first place.</p>

      <p>The latest initiative comes as the state struggles to address its growing rate of methamphetamine use in recent years, particularly among its youth.</p>
      <p>In 2016, the South Dakota's <a href="https://dss.sd.gov/docs/behavioralhealth/community/meth_prevention_toolkit.pdf">Department of Social Services</a> reported that the number of young people in the state who have reported using meth was 3.8 percent, compared to the national average of 3 percent.</p>
      <p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse has also <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/research-reports/methamphetamine/what-scope-methamphetamine-misuse-in-united-states">estimated</a> that 964,000 people age 12 and older, which account for about 0.4 percent of the total U.S. population, reported a methamphetamine use disorder in 2017, marking a significant increase from the previous year. </p>
      <p>The governor's office didn't immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment. </p>
