      <p>People seem to value <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/privacy/">privacy</a> more than ever these days, and with such a massive part of our lives taking place in digital conversations, isn’t it about time we do more to protect them?</p>
      <p>Not all apps incorporate native conversation-centric privacy features, but with the help of a newly released <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweak</a> called <b>ChatLock</b> by iOS developer <i>Elias Sfeir</i>, you can lock individual conversations in several of your favorite messaging apps with just a few taps to prevent friends and family from logging into your device and reading your personal chats.</p>
      <p>As depicted in the screenshot examples above, ChatLock works by integrating a ‘Lock’ function into several popular chat apps, including <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/imessage/">iMessage</a> and SMS in Apple’s native Messages app, direct messages in the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> app, messages in the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> Messenger app, and direct message in the <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> app. Depending on the app and its interface, the Lock feature may appear as a swipe-to-access button or as a tap-to-access prompt.</p>
      <p>After you lock a conversation, you won’t be able to read the contents until you authenticate yourself with a password or with biometrics (<a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/face-id/">Face ID</a> and <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/touch-id/">Touch ID</a> are both supported). The password works great as a backup when you find yourself in a situation where biometrics are inconvenient. Here’s a quick video demo compliments of the developer:</p>

      <p>Upon downloading ChatLock, you’ll find a dedicated preference pane in the Settings app where you can configure it to your liking:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Here, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable or disable taking a picture with the front-facing camera when authentication fails</li>
        <li>Configure options for the Messages app</li>
        <li>Configure options for the Twitter app</li>
        <li>Configure options for the WhatsApp Messenger app</li>
        <li>Configure options for the Instagram app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Options that you can configure for each app include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enabling or disabling biometric authentication</li>
        <li>Hide the chat cell’s contents from view in thread mode when locked</li>
        <li>Configure a written password to act as a biometric backup</li>
        <li>Resolve application crashes</li>
        <li>Clean up an app when it slows down</li>
        <li>And more…</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The developer provides a Respring button at the bottom of the secondary preference panes so that you can save any changes you make on demand.</p>
      <p>We particularly like the fact that you can forcibly capture a front-facing picture on a failed authentication attempt because this means you can find out who might be trying to read your conversations. If you have a friend, family member, or spouse who knows your <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/passcode/">passcode</a>, this can be a common occurrence. Fortunately, now you can be aware of your surroundings even when you aren’t around your device.</p>
      <p>If you’re interested in protecting your conversation privacy even further, then you can <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.elias.chatlock/">purchase ChatLock for $1.50 from the Packix repository</a> in your preferred package manager. The tweak supports <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak/">jailbroken</a> iOS 11, 12, and 13 devices.</p>
