      <p>Health officials are urging parents to make sure their children are vaccinated after a suspected outbreak of mumps at a secondary school in Nottinghamshire.</p>
      <p>Around 16 sixth-form students from the Toot Hill School in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/bingham">Bingham</a> have fallen ill with symptoms usually indicative of the viral mumps infection.</p>
      <p>The sixth-form college currently has around 380 students and the school informed Public Health England's East Midlands protection team about the potential outbreak on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>The viral infection is usually recognised by painful swelling of glands in an infected person's face, sometimes referred to as "hamster face", the NHS says.</p>

      <p>Sandy Paley, the headteacher at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/education">Toot Hill School</a>, said: "The school has distributed the official Public Health England advice to all parents and staff and are reinforcing the guidance to our students in school.</p>
      <p>"Our first priority is always the well-being and health of our students and we are continuing to monitor the situation closely."</p>
      <p>Public Health England has urged teenagers and young adults, aged 15 to 24, to get vaccinated against the infection by having the MMR vaccine.</p>
      <p>The health body is working with the school to explain to children why the vaccination is important.</p>
      <p>Dr Vanessa MacGregor, consultant in health protection at PHE, said it is important people have had two doses of the MMR vaccine.</p>
      <p>She added: "We have seen a rise in the figures recently and teenagers and young adults who have not had two doses of MMR vaccine are particularly vulnerable.</p>
      <p>"Young adults who have not received the MMR or only received one dose should ensure that they take up the offer of MMR vaccination.</p>
      <p>"However, it’s not just students who are at risk and we would urge everyone who hasn’t received two doses of MMR vaccine to do so. MMR also gives immunity to measles and rubella."</p>
      <p>Other symptoms of mumps include headaches, joint pain and swelling of a parotid glands in the neck.</p>
      <p>While the infection is not usually serious, it can lead to complications such as glandular fever and tonsillitis.</p>
