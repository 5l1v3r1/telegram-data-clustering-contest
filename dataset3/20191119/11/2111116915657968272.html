      <p>Pure Scooters – one of the UK's biggest retailers of electric scooters – is offering some huge discounts for Black Friday, knocking up to £500 off some of its most popular models.</p>
      <p>The deals include £100 off the Segway-Ninebot ES4 Electric KickScooter, which took the top spot in our roundup of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/best-electric-scooters">the best electric scooters</a>. With its top speed of 18.6mph and range of 28 miles (in optimum conditions) it's seriously impressive, and puts many more expensive scooters to shame.</p>
      <p>If you find a cheaper price on the ES4 elsewhere, it's well worth reading the fine print before pulling the trigger; all scooters purchased from Pure come with a two-year manufacturer's warranty, and are shipped from the UK so you won't be left waiting weeks for delivery.</p>
      <p>There's also £100 off the enormously popular Xiaomi M365 at Pure, which brings it down to just £298.99. This deal makes Pure the cheapest official Xiaomi retailer in the UK.</p>
