      <h1>New forest policy on anvil; climate change a key feature, says official</h1>
      <h2>It's going to be the country's fourth forest policy after the ones launched in 1894, 1952 and 1988</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:55:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:55</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>More than 30 years after it was last launched, a new <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/national-forest-policy">national </a><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/forest-policy">forest policy </a>that would deal with issues such as <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-climate-change">climate change </a>and human-wild life conflict is now on the anvil, a key official said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Director General of the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) Suresh Gairola said the revised draft -- finalised after the Ministry of Environment, Forest and <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-climate-change">Climate Change </a>examined public comments -- is under the consideration of the government.</p>
      <p>"We are hopeful that very soon we will get Government of India approval," he told reporters at the Institute of Wood Science and Technology here.</p>
      <p>It's going to be the country's fourth <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/forest-policy">forest policy </a>after the ones launched in 1894, 1952 and 1988, he noted.</p>
      <p>Gairola said some areas like <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-climate-change">climate change </a>and human-wild life conflict which were not considered very important when the last policy was launched in 1988, would figure prominently in the upcoming one.</p>
      <p>Over the years, climate change and human-wild life conflict have become major issues, Gairola pointed out.</p>
      <p>He also said ICFRE is ready with the final draft of the new ten-year National Forestry Research Plan (2020-2030) after more than two years of research, and it will be released soon.</p>
      <p>The draft has taken into account the commitment made by India to sequester carbon dioxide to the tune of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes additionally by the year 2030 from forestry sector, among other things, Gairola said.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, ICFRE is preparing a detailed project report on forestry intervention to rejuvenate 13 major river basins in the country, including the Krishna and Cauvery.</p>
      <p>The DPR is slated to be completed by June next year, he said.</p>
