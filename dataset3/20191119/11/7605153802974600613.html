      <h1>Manchester City’s revenue rises to Sh 70 billion</h1>

        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 19 – Manchester City’s on-field success saw the club’s revenues swell to Sh70 billion (£535 million) last season as the Premier League champions posted a profit for the fifth straight year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A 20 percent surge in broadcast revenue saw City’s income rise from Sh65 billion (£500.5 million) in the 2017/18 season.</p>
      <p>Pep Guardiola’s men completed an unprecedented quadruple of England’s domestic trophies by winning the Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup and Community Shield.</p>
      <p>The sale of a host of players unable to break into the first team helped boost profits to Sh1.3 billion (£10.1 million).</p>
      <p>Prior to Sheikh Mansour’s takeover of City in 2008, the club’s revenue was a mere Sh 11.4 billion (£87 million).</p>
      <p>Huge losses of over Sh76 billion (£584 million) followed during the first six years of their ownership due to massive investment in the playing squad and facilities, including the Sh 26 billion (£200 million) Etihad Campus training ground.</p>
      <p>However, a boom in commercial and broadcast revenue brought about by continued qualification for the Champions League and four Premier League titles in the past eight seasons has seen City post a profit in each of the past five years.</p>
      <p>“As intended by His Highness Sheikh Mansour, our organisation is now at a level of maturity that enables us to plan on multi-year cycles both in terms of our management of squads and more widely across the business,” City chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“This strategic planning has allowed us to create an environment in which continued on-pitch success is both possible and likely, and financial sustainability is a reality.”</p>
      <p>City’s income is still dwarfed by local rivals Manchester United’s Sh82 billion (£627 million) revenue for the 2018/19 season.</p>
      <p>However, the gap between the two will be significantly closer this season with United expecting their income to fall to between Sh73 billion – Sh76 billion (£560-580 million) due to a lack of Champions League football.</p>
      <p>City’s figures for this season will also be bolstered by a club record kit deal with Puma worth a reported Sh8.5 billion (£65 million) a season over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>However, the club are still under scrutiny due to an investigation from UEFA into alleged breaches of financial fair play (FFP).</p>
      <p>The investigation into City is based on leaked emails published last year by German magazine Der Spiegel that City flouted FFP regulations by inflating the value of sponsorship deals.</p>
      <p>Possible punishments include a ban from the Champions League, a transfer ban or a fine.</p>
