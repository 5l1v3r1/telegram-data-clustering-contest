        <b>An 80-year-old gran who went to get her eyes tested had her life saved by opticians - who spotted she was having a stroke.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Alice McCaughey, 80, was unaware that her speech was badly slurred when she went for a check up.</p>

      <p>Staff at the branch of Specsavers, in Oak Mall, Greenock, Inverclyde, were alarmed and noticed that the OAP was struggling with her mobility.</p>
      <p>The optician insisted Alice should go to hospital to be checked over.</p>
      <p>A taxi rushed the gran to Inverclyde Royal Hospital, where medics quickly assessed that she was having a stroke.</p>
      <p>Alice said: "I was going for a check up and on the way in the driver said my speech was a little odd.</p>
      <p>"I went into the opticians and they immediately recognised it was badly slurred, even though at the time I had no idea anything was going on.</p>
      <p>"I was completely unaware, in fact.</p>

      <p>"The optician told me she didn't want to alarm me but said that was the second time she had noticed that with me while I was in the store.</p>
      <p>"She said that she was sending me to the hospital to be checked over and it turned out I was having a stroke.</p>
      <p>"I can't thank them enough for their speed of thinking.</p>
      <p>"They possibly saved my life."</p>

      <p>She was diagnosed with a TIA, which can lead to major stroke if it goes untreated.</p>
      <p>Alice added: "I was in A&amp;E then I was moved to the stroke ward.</p>

      <p>"I can honestly say it was a privilege to be there to see for myself the amazing work the team there do.</p>
      <p>"I just think it is important to say how great the hospital staff at Inverclyde Royal Hospital were when areas of our local services seem to keep being moved to Glasgow."</p>
      <p>The terrifying ordeal was the second time Alice had been helped by the Oak Mall opticians, after a routine check up a few years ago identified a blood clot in her eye.</p>
      <p>Alice was diagnosed with macular degeneration and has been undergoing a course of treatment since that sees her receive regular injections to save her sight.</p>
      <p>She said: "They noticed I had a blood clot in my eye and sent me to hospital. I have had eye jabs since.</p>
      <p>"I might not have realised what was happening without staff's intervention.</p>
