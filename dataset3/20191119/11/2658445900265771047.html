      <p>U.S. citizen Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks were released by the Taliban on Tuesday, three years after being kidnapped, as part of a prisoner-swap deal.</p>
      <p>“We are so happy to hear that my brother has been freed and is on his way home to us,” King’s sister, Stephanie Miller, said in a statement on behalf of the family.]</p>
      <p>“This has been a long and painful ordeal for our entire family, and his safe return has been our highest priority.</p>
      <p>“We appreciate the support we have received and ask for privacy as we await Kevin’s safe return.”</p>
      <p>King and Weeks were taken by the Taliban in August 2016 while teaching at the American University of Afghanistan.</p>

      <p>Both were released in exchange for the conditional release of senior Taliban members being held by the Afghan government.</p>
      <p>They include Abdul Rashid, Haji Mali Khan, and the younger brother of the notorious Haqqani network leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, Anas Haqqani.<br/>Afghan President Ashraf Ghani approved the release of the Taliban prisoners a week ago.</p>
      <p>There has been no confirmation yet that the Taliban prisoners have been released.</p>
      <p>American University of Afghanistan said it welcomes the news of King and Weeks’ release and “shares the relief of the families.”</p>
