      <p>A Hope man is back behind bars after he allegedly continued to traffic in illegal firearms after he'd been released on parole.</p>
      <p>Back in 2014, Bradley Friesen was <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/BC/121189/man-faces-37-new-gun-charges">charged with 46 counts </a>related to the trafficking of firearms, after the United States's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reached out to Canadian authorities.</p>
      <p>The ATF accused Friesen of selling gun parts that convert Glock pistols into fully automatic weapons, along with silencers, over the internet. At the time, Friesen was already prohibited from possessing firearms after a 2001 conviction.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Friesen pleaded guilty to 26 of the charges and was handed a 10-year sentence, minus time already served.</p>
      <p>Friesen was granted parole after serving half of his sentence, but last month, the Canada Border Services Agency intercepted three separate packages en route to Friesen. The Combined Forces Special Enforcement Unit of B.C. says the packages contained “prohibited devices” that involved firearms parts.</p>
      <p>After a “brief investigation,” Friesen was arrested last Thursday and his parole was revoked. While police conducted a search of Friesen's home in Hope, no new charges have been laid against him at this time.</p>
      <p>“Bradley Friesen is a well-known offender who is alleged to have showed a complete disregard for the safety of the public, and a complete disregard for the conditions placed on him upon his release into the public,” said Sergeant Brenda Winpenny, of the CFSEU-BC.</p>
      <p>“The ability of the CFSEU-BC to successfully work with our many provincial partners has taken potentially lethal items off the street and put a dangerous offender back behind bars.”</p>
