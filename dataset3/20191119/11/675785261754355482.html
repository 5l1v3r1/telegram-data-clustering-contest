      <h1>Primark customer baffled after finding huge mistake on Christmas reindeer toy</h1>
      <h2>Holly Megan was baffled to discover the Christmas toy had an ear where its arm should be after walking into the store over the weekend</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:20:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:20</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, Andy Crick, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p>A bungling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/primark-inc">Primark</a> store sold a baffled customer a soft toy reindeer with an ear where its arm should be.</p>
      <p>Holly Megan snapped up the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/christmas">festive</a> toy as a gift for a friend on the weekend.</p>
      <p>But she only realised the hilarious gaffe once she got home.</p>
      <p>The purple reindeer had three lugholes and three limbs with the extra ear mistakenly been sewn on in place of its left arm.</p>
      <p>"Just bought this from @Primark as a Christmas present for a friend," Holly tweeted.</p>
      <p>"Got him home to realise he has an ear for an arm. How is that even possible to mistake."</p>

      <p>And Primark, which last month had to pull a London tea towel off its shelves after it was littered with mistakes, apologised.</p>
      <p>The budget clothes chain said it would offer her a new one or her money back.</p>
      <p>Primark tweeted: "Oops!" and a shocked face emoji.</p>

      <p>It added: "This should not happen, Holly!</p>
      <p>"You are welcome to return it to the store for an exchange or a refund!</p>
      <p>"We have passed your comments on to the buying team!"</p>
      <p>A Primark spokesman told Mirror Online: "Where we identify an error on one of our products, we will remove the product concerned from sale as quickly as possible, and customers can return it to one of our stores for a full refund.</p>
      <p>"We apologise for any inconvenience caused."</p>

      <p>The tea towel blunders in October included landmarks in the wrong place on a map.</p>
      <p>Big Ben, for example, was wrongly situated south of the River Thames.</p>
      <p>Westminster Abbey was also incorrectly located on the south bank.</p>
