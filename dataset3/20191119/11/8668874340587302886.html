      <h1>Irish fears that RWC reject Kieran Marmion would take up English offer have ended</h1>

      <p>Ireland World Cup reject <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/connacht/players/kieran-marmion/">Kieran Marmion</a> has finally set aside his frustration and has extended his contract with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/european-champions-cup/teams/connacht">Connacht</a> through to 2023.</p>
      <p>Upset that he was not included by Joe Schmidt for the recent finals in Japan, Marmion, the starter at No9 when <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/ireland">Ireland</a> defeated <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">New Zealand</a> in November 2018, was said to be considering a move to the UK.</p>
      <p>The London-born, Welsh-raised Irish exile was apparently in demand, with Saracens, the club his late father Mick played for, among his suitors.   </p>
      <p>However, the 27-year-old, who had been capped 27 times by Ireland before being excluded by Schmidt for the World Cup, has decided to take up a three-year extension offer with Connacht, the club he has been with since joining their academy in 2011.</p>
      <p>“Kieran’s commitment to Connacht for a further three seasons demonstrates his ambition to contribute at provincial and international level in the coming years,” said Connacht coach Andy Friend, who is in his second season working with Marmion in Galway.</p>

      <p>“His signing also ensures that we continue to retain a squad equipped to compete at the highest level of European club rugby. Kieran has been an outstanding player for Connacht and for Ireland.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/the-latest-irish-rugby-world-cup-hangover-threatening-the-irish-provinces/">He is a diligent professional</a> and through his hard work, he has progressed through the Connacht academy and on to play for Ireland. His progress demonstrates the support that is available to players through our academy pathway.”</p>
      <p>Having represented Ireland at age-grade level, Marmion has since played more than 160 games for Connacht. He made his Ireland Test debut in June 2014.</p>
