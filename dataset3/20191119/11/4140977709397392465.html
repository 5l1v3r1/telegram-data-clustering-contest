            <b>USA Vs WIE Dream11 Team Probable Playing 11, Toss, Pitch And Match Report: Topsy-turvy clash sees Group B table toppers and bottom placed side face off against each other.</b>
          </p>
          <p>When you are an international cricket team partaking in a domestic tournamnet and have failed to win all of your matches till now, it is blatant that there is something evidently not right in our cricketing setup. And if the bygone matches across the global stage weren’t enough to make that narrative clear to USA, their ongoing campaign in the Super50 Cup in West Indies will be a rude realisation to just how much work the side need to enshrine in place to overturn an appalling set of results for them.</p>
          <p>Winless after four matches, the side are befittingly slumped down into bottom place in Group B, an ordeal they need to wrench out of at the earliest if they are to have any chances of challenging for a spot in the annuls of the group. What has been the biggest exasperation is not just the defeats but the manner in which they have come about with the side failing to show any kind of a fight to be obliterated from sight by their opponents.</p>

                <p>Defeated by 43 runs by Trinidad and Tobago in their last outing as they fell to a mere 201 in pursuit of 245, USA know things aren’t going to get any easier today either when they square off against the group leaders. In West Indies Emerging Team, they are clashing heads against a side who haven’t offered the slightest of leeway ever since losing their tournamnet opener to go on a four match winning spree which alludes to the gargantuan nature of this side.</p>
                <p>The side come into this encounter having persevered in a low scoring fixture against Guyana the last time around as they peeled off their opponents for just 167. It was a complete effort from their bowling unit, one which saw them pick up wickets at crucial junctures to compensate for a lacklustre batting display and guide the side to a 9 run win.</p>

                      </p>
                      <p>A two toned surface, the conditions in the first part of the encounter will be conducive to the batters before the track starts unravelling to see the bats face the wrath of the spinners. The wicket will open up to come out and play favourably for bowlers who take pace off the ball while chasing to see the side winning the toss today opting to come out and bat first.</p>

                            <h3>USA Vs WIE Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>With 241 runs in 5 ties, Joshua da Silva has been in imperious form with the wicket-keeper guiding West Indies Emerging Team to some colossal scores. The bat is the fulcrum of his side’s batting order, a name who has held fort for his unit to see us rope him into our Dream 11 side for the day.</p>
                            <p>We have the one pick come into our facet from USA as well with us opting for their wicket-keeper Monank Patel. He might have only scored 113 runs in four matches but the figure is massively more than what his counterparts have managed with the player showing valour, will and resolve to bide his time out in the middle.</p>
                            <h3>USA Vs WIE Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>He will find company in the form of Xavier Marshall after the bat scored a 50 in the side’s foregone encounter to become the lone pick we have opted for from USA for this one. Elsewhere from the home side we are moving in with Justin Greaves with the player giving pinch perfect assistance to Joshua to come up with 239 runs in 5 matches.</p>
                            <p>Roland Cato comes in as well from unit to become the second pick from the side and wrap up our batting order from today’s forthcoming contest.</p>
                            <h3>USA Vs WIE Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Compensating for the picks from USA over here, the all-rounders from the side are the safest bets for this match owing to the two toned nature they offer as players. In Karima Gore, we have a player who has snagged up7 wickets in three matches for his side while Steven Taylor has contributed with 88 runs and 3 wickets in 4 matches to see us move in with the partnership for today.</p>
                            <p>Combined Colleges and Campuses on the other hand will have the sole representation over here with Kevin Sinclair being our choice from the unit.</p>
                            <h3>USA Vs WIE Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>When you have ended up blasting through oppositions, ripping them apart and blowing them over to work your way through to 15 wickets in 5 matches, it is only rightful of us to get in a player of such calibre into our side. Keon Jovani Harding has divulged into the repertoire of skill set at his persuasion to emerge as the frontline bowler for his side, someone who’ll be leaving USA in a tussle as he laments a sorry batting unit today.</p>
                            <p>Dominik Drakes and Ashmead Nedd come in from Combined Colleges ad Campuses as well, two bowlers who deviations and pitched in the perfect channels deliveries will see them thrive and flourish today.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>Joshua will captain our side for the day whilst Keon is our vice-captain.</p>
