      <p>An Australian national, William James, 35, was admitted in a critical condition in Kumareshwara hospital on Monday night after he was allegedly beaten up by Konkanakoppa villagers in Badami taluk. He is now out of danger.</p>
      <p>According to the police, Mr. James is a resident of Melbourne who has come to Badami, possibly as a tourist.</p>
      <p>Why he was assaulted is not exactly clear. While one version said he might have been beaten up by people who couldnâ€™t understand his language, another version said he was inebriated, and was getting into houses and misbehaving with residents.</p>
      <p>After being alerted by villagers, the police arrived and took Mr. James, who was found with his hands tied with a rope, to Bagalkot city where he was admitted to a hospital.</p>
      <p>There has been no arrests so far, though eight persons have been detained for questioning.</p>
      <p>The police said they found no person with his name checked into any hotel in Badami. So they are checking with hotels in Bagalkot city.</p>
      <p>Kerur police have registered a case.</p>
