      <p><b>Best</b> Workout Cases for Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ Android Central 2019</p>
      <p>If you're trying to live a healthier life, your smartphone can be an excellent tool for aiding you on your journey. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ are especially great for this, as they can not only track your steps but also keep tabs on your heart thanks to the built-in heart sensor. Unfortunately, on their own, the S9 and S9+ aren't the most durable phones around. To make them better suited for the gym, a hike, or anything in between, here are the best workout cases you can get!</p>

      <p>Staff pick</p>
      <p>There are actually two parts to this case, the first of which is — well — a case! This is a fully-fledged case that you can put on your S9 and take with you wherever you go. However, when it comes time for a workout, you can attach it to the included Clip'N'Go armband that secures it to your arm. The only drawback is that it's only available for the smaller S9.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Armband-JEMACHE-Exercise-Workout-Samsung/dp/B0722KZGYG?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU68151YYw">Great in every way</a>: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Armband-JEMACHE-Exercise-Workout-Samsung/dp/B0722KZGYG?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU68151YYw">JEMACHE Armband</a></h3>
      <p>JEMACHE's case is made out of breathable neoprene material, and with this, the case stays odor-free, lightweight, and is soft against your skin. The material can be stretched to get the perfect fit, and after a few intense workout sessions, you can throw it in the washer without having to worry about it getting ruined. It also has a reflective strip and can discretely hold a house or car key.</p>

      <p>Like the name of this armband suggests, it's designed to be completely resistant against sweat. This is evident by the various hole cutouts throughout the armband, all of which allow perspiration to quickly evaporate and keep the armband durable for a long time to come. The larger size fits the Galaxy S9+ like a glove, and you'll also find a hidden pocket for storing a credit card and keys.</p>

      <p>For our runners out there, this is a fantastic choice. There are sizes available for both the Galaxy S9 and S9+ for the same price, and both are super lightweight, have an opening in the back so you can still access your phone's fingerprint sensor, and sweat and rain protection. Similar to other armbands, there's a slot for storing cards, cash, and keys.</p>

      <p>If you want an armband that's affordable, durable, and fits the Galaxy S9, look no further than this option from Tribe. It looks great and comes in a large selection of different colors, and the medium size that's linked below should fit the S9 like a glove. The armband is designed to be water- and sweat- resistant, is lightweight, and even has added cable management if you're using your phone with a pair of wired headphones.</p>

      <p>Lastly, we have the i2 Gear Armband. You'll find a solid collection of different colors to choose from, a lightweight (yet durable) design, and quality materials throughout. The armband also has a reflective strip to keep you visible during evening runs and a small pouch for holding a house or car key.</p>

      <h3>If you still can't decide</h3>
      <p>Whether you're working out at the gym or going on an outdoor run, a good workout case can make a world of difference. If you have the Galaxy S9, you can't go wrong with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CGV6S8T?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU68151YYw">Encased Armband Set</a>. We love how this doubles as both a regular, rugged case and can easily attach to your arm for workout transportation. There's nothing else quite like it, and the price is right, too.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a more traditional workout case, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Armband-JEMACHE-Exercise-Workout-Samsung/dp/B0722KZGYG?tag=androidcentralb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUacUdUnU68151YYw">JEMACHE Armband</a> is also solid. JEMACHE's armband has it all, including a breathable neoprene material, pockets for a key and ID, and a handy loop for your wired headphones. The Rosy color shown above looks great, but if you want something more subdued, you can opt for the more basic Black color.</p>
      <p>If you think you'll want a more general-use case, however, or just don't like the idea of a workout case anymore, there are still plenty of options. Hop on over to our list of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-galaxy-s9-cases">best overall cases</a> and see if anything strikes your fancy.</p>
