      <h1>Frank Lampard makes decision on Chelsea stars as Blues prepare four new contracts</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea have enjoyed a fine start to the 2019/20 season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:27:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:27</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Chelsea are considering offering new contracts to <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/tammy-abraham">Tammy Abraham</a>, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/fikayo-tomori">Fikayo Tomori</a>, Reece James and Tino Anjorin, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Blues came into the 2019/20 season with a transfer ban over their heads and a new manager in Frank Lampard, with expectations tempered.</p>
      <p>But Lampard and his side have shocked plenty since their opening weekend 4-0 hammering at Manchester United.</p>
      <p>There were plenty of doubters after the humbling experience at Old Trafford, but <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> have only lost one of their last eleven league games, something which includes six consecutive wins.</p>
      <p>Chelsea currently sit third in the Premier League table, one point ahead of two-time reigning champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Abraham and Tomori have been regulars in Lampard's team and now it's said that both players could be handed new deals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-ug/news/chelsea-in-talks-to-extend-willians-deal-despite-barcelona/dccm0n9a83l01nj0a8fl1pgp6">Goal.com</a> are reporting that Lampard wants to tie the two players down to long-term deals.</p>
      <p>The same can be said for James, who has been called into the first team of late.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, whilst Anjorin is the least recognisable name of the quartet, it's understood that Lampard is equally bullish about the 17-year-old's potential.</p>
      <p>This would all rate as good news for Chelsea fans, especially in regards to the aforementioned Abraham and Tomori.</p>
      <p>Abraham has been a leading light up front for the Blues so far this season, having bagged ten goals in 12 Premier League games.</p>
      <p>Tomori, meanwhile, has featured in nine league matches for Lampard, with the 21-year-old defender impressing of late, something which has led to an appearance for England.</p>

      <p>Abraham's current contract runs until the summer of 2022 and Tomori is tied down until the summer of 2021, but it's expected both players will receive increased base salaries as part of any new extension.</p>
