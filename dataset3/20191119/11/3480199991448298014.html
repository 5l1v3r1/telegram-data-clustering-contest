      <p>Shropshire Council leader Peter Nutting said schemes such as Shrewsbury's North West Relief Road and other main routes will remain vital in such a rural county.</p>
      <p>Councillor Nutting was speaking after complaints that the council should focus on promoting and developing green modes of transport.</p>
      <p>He said the council put a focus on promoting sustainable transport – but conceded that a modern road network was needed in a rural county like Shropshire.</p>
      <p>The council has had £54.4 million funding from the Government confirmed for the North West Relief Road earlier this year – with the road potentially open by late 2023.</p>
      <p>It is also seeking financial backing for dualling the A5 between Oswestry and Montford Bridge and introducing safety measure on the A483 at the Llynclys crossroads.</p>
      <p>Proposals are also due to be raised with the Government in a bid to extend the M54 to Shrewsbury after full council signed off the plans in September.</p>
      <p>Councillor Nutting said: “We are in a position here where we are such a rural county that while we are placing a large focus on sustainable transport we also have to say, if you want the jobs, you’ve got to have the roads.</p>
      <h3>Journey</h3>
      <p>“We are looking across the board at all things and we will have to going forward.</p>
      <p>“It is very easy to get a bus from one side of town to the other and that is great.</p>
      <p>“But what if you want to get a bus from Oswestry to Bridgnorth? Well, that’s two buses you have to get and a long journey.</p>
      <p>“We are a rural county from north to south and we have got to have the road system in place to support the future and attract employers to the county.”</p>
      <p>A report to Shropshire Council’s cabinet on Monday discussed the work of the Marches Local Enterprise Partnership, outlining plans for the future.</p>
      <p>It said: “There are clear priorities for future investment, including bypasses, dual carriageways, alternative road routes, and frequency of rail services.</p>
      <p>“The Marches LEP and its partners will therefore work cross-border with the West Midlands Combined Authority and the Black Country to deliver infrastructure that will support strategic growth.</p>
      <p>“This will also include delivery of improvements in physical and digital infrastructure necessary to support clean growth and improved productivity, and tackle digital connectivity for rural communities and businesses.”</p>
