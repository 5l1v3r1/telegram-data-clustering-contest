      </ul>
      <p>As well as starring in the film as Ramona, Lopez also acted as its producer. <i>Hustlers</i> has made £113.8 million worldwide so far, but the singer hasn’t seen a penny of that, she’s revealed.</p>
      <p>Speaking in <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019"><i>GQ</i></a>’s Men of the Year issue, where she’s named Icon Of The Year, Lopez said: “I didn’t get paid a whole bunch of money for Hustlers.”</p>
      <p>She clarified: “I did it for free and produced it. Like Jenny from the Block — I do what I love.”</p>

      <p>Jennifer Lopez in ‘Hustlers’</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/movie/hustlers-review-practically-perfect-stripper-movie-win-j-lo-oscar">an NME review of <i>Hustlers</i> from the Toronto International Film Festival</a>, Douglas Greenwood called the film “practically perfect” and said it could win J-Lo an Oscar.</p>
      <p>“What a delight it is that just when cinema is about to get snobbish and cerebral that a film as confident, slick and vivacious as this comes out of the woodwork and surprises people,” the review continues.</p>
      <p>“There are men who’ve made films half as good as <i>Hustlers</i> that have taken home Oscars. If this film gets snubbed, mark my words: you’ll find me rioting in the streets in sky-high heels.</p>
