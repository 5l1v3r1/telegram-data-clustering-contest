      <p>The alleged ringleader of a home invasion robbery and shooting in Penticton last month has been denied bail, while his alleged accomplice will be released from custody for a second time.</p>
      <p>Josef Pavlik, 38, will stay in prison until charges related to the Oct. 2 robbery and shooting are resolved. He’s charged with break and enter, armed robbery, assault with a weapon and uttering threats. </p>
      <p>Jesse Mason, 32, will be released to a Penticton motel room with a 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew that will be electronically monitored. He’s also been ordered to avoid contact with the alleged victims and accomplices. Mason faces a single count of break and enter. </p>
      <p>Judge Michelle Daneliuk's reasons and contents of the bail hearing are covered by a routine publication ban.</p>
      <p>However, alleged victims Michael Paseska and Sarah Edwards <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/267385/awakened-by-a-gun-in-face">spoke with Castanet News </a>the day after the robbery and shooting. </p>
      <p>The pair said they had been sleeping in bed when a group of masked men woke them up with a firearm and demanded valuables.</p>
      <p>Paseska said Josef Pavlik struck him with the butt of the handgun, which was fired four to five times inside the bedroom. A bullet grazed Paseska’s face, leaving him with a minor wound.</p>
      <p>RCMP said in a news release the men then fled to a home on Maple Street, where an hours-long standoff occurred. During the standoff, police could be heard calling for a "Jesse" repeatedly, urging him to come out. Both Mason and Pavlik were arrested at the home, police said.</p>
      <p>This is Mason’s second attempt at bail. He was originally released on Oct. 22, but was arrested less than two days later for allegedly violating his curfew. </p>
      <p>Pavlik has a very lengthy criminal record, while Mason’s is less severe, according to online court records.</p>
      <p>Both men are due back in court Dec. 4.</p>
