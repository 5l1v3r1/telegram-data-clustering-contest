      <h1>Scottish Labour leader leads push to win back West Dunbartonshire in election</h1>
      <h2>Richard Leonard says he is focused on helping Jean Anne Mitchell defeat the SNP’s Martin Docherty-Hughes.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:04:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:04</time> by <a rel="author">Fraser Clarke, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/fraser-clarke/</a></address>
      <p>Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard says the party are determined to win back West Dunbartonshire at next month’s general election.</p>
      <p>Speaking as he campaigned in Balloch last week, Leonard exclusively told the Lennox Herald he is focused on helping Jean Anne Mitchell defeat the SNP’s Martin Docherty-Hughes in what historically has been one of his party’s safest constituencies in the country.</p>
      <p>He said: “West Dunbartonshire is one of our main target seats. Jean Anne came close to winning last time as she took a huge chunk out of the SNP majority, but we don’t take for granted that it’s just a case of one more heave.</p>
      <p>“We will be campaigning flat out to make sure that Jean Anne is the next member of parliament for this seat.</p>
      <p>“Locally we are hugely concerned about the continued cuts to the funding which West Dunbartonshire Council gets from the Scottish Government.</p>
      <p>“Over time there has been a continued intensity of pressure on the council, forcing them to make some really difficult decisions.</p>
      <p>“We want greater investment in public services and communities.”</p>
      <p>Jean Anne said: “I’ve spent a lot of time knocking on doors of people who are suffering the most dreadful austerity and the number of people who have come into total crisis because of Universal Credit is disgraceful.</p>
      <p>“I really want to focus on helping those people.</p>
      <p>“Voting SNP will not get anything other than another Tory government.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrats and Green Party have revealed the identity of their candidates for next month’s vote.</p>
      <p>Jenni Lang will stand for the Lib Dems, who finished a distant fourth place in 2017 with just 2.3 percent of the vote, whilst Peter Connolly will become the Greens first ever parliamentary candidate in West Dunbartonshire.</p>
      <p>Also standing is independent candidate Andrew Muir whose wife, Claire, stood in the 2015 election – also as an independent – polling just over 500 votes.</p>
      <p>The SNP’s Martin Docherty-Hughes, Labour’s Jean Anne Mitchell and the Conservatives’ Alix Mathieson are the other candidates who complete the ballot paper.</p>
      <p>The election takes place on December 12 and anyone who wants to vote but is not yet registered has until 5pm on November 26 to ensure they do so www.gov.uk/register-to-vote.</p>
      <h3>Peter Connolly - Greens</h3>

      <p>As a father and grandfather, I am truly terrified of the future we are creating for our children and grandchildren. Only the Greens are taking the climate crisis seriously.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Green New Deal is a plan of action that can be taken now to avert the climate crisis and create thousands of well-paid jobs. We can build a more just, sustainable and prosperous nation.</p>
      <p>I am standing in this election for the sake of all our children and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>We need immediate climate action through the Scottish Green New Deal. No other party recognises the urgency of the climate emergency which cannot wait for Brexit or independence. The loudest and clearest way to demand climate action is to vote Scottish Green on December 12.</p>
      <p>I aim to highlight the climate emergency as the biggest challenge facing us, but also to ensure the cruel injustices of poverty are never overlooked.</p>
      <p>I believe that the Greens’ radical proposals and New Deal mean that they are the best party to create a fairer and more just country.</p>
      <h3>Andrew Muir - Independent</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The reason I am standing is the disgusting treatment my wife received in the Vale of Leven hospital in 2006.</p>
      <p>No human being should be treated in that way. In my opinion she was unlawfully detained and the criminal offences of false statements on documents and ill-treatment occurred. We are still waiting for justice for this.</p>
      <p>The failure to prosecute leads to the needless deaths of others.</p>
      <p>If you Google “Claire Muir Dumbarton” you will find my wife’s experience. The UN has prohibited the practice of forced treatment.</p>
      <p>Martin Docherty-Hughes has failed to help me on this. He has told me he has no answers and that I instead should stand for election myself. The SNP have banned me from party membership.</p>
      <p>Anyone who complains to the council is vilified. Look what’s happened to Jim Bollan and George Black. That might explain why I’m the only candidate standing who lives in the constituency.</p>
      <h3>Jenni Lang - Liberal Democrats</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats’ message to voters in West Dunbartonshire at this election is clear.</p>
      <p>If you vote for me as your next MP, <br/>I will do everything I can to maintain Scotland’s place at the heart of the UK and the UK’s place in Europe.</p>
      <p>Cutting ties with our closest neighbours is a backwards and isolating move – that’s been the lesson of the past three years. We need to learn the lessons of Brexit, not repeat the mistakes.</p>
      <p>“Rather than arguing over Brexit and independence, we should be getting on with investing in local services and tackling the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>“A vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit and build a brighter future for Scotland in the UK.”</p>
