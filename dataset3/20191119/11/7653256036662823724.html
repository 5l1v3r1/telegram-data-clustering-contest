      <p>Young population in the 18-30 year age bracket is weaning away from the national <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/rural-employment-guarantee-scheme">rural employment guarantee scheme</a> of the government since 2015-16, a data from the Parliament question shows.</p>
      <p>As per the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Management-Information-System">Management Information System</a> (MIS), the average share of workforce under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (Mahatma Gandhi NREGS) in the age group of 18-30 in 2018-19 stood at 9.10% or 70.74 lakh of the total workforce (777.41 lakh) under MRNREGA as compared to 10.07% or 72.74 lakh in 2015-16 when the total workforce under <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/MGNREGA">MGNREGA</a> stood at 722.59 lakh, rural development minister <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Narendra-Singh-Tomar">Narendra Singh Tomar</a> said in a written reply in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/elections/lok-sabha">Lok Sabha</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The percentage of young population enrolled under MGNREGA in the previous fiscal is higher than 2017-18 when it stood at 7.73% at 58.7 lakh of the total workforce of 759.15 lakh. However, the proportion of young population to the overall workforce stood at the same level at 9.10% in 2016-17 with 69.78 lakh workers in the 18-30 age bracket of the total MGNREGA workforce of 766.91 lakh in that year.</p>
      <p>Mahatma Gandhi NREGS is a demand driven <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/wage-employment-programme">wage employment programme</a>. It provides livelihood security for the rural households when no better employment opportunity is available.</p>
      <p>The demand for work is influenced by various factors such as rain-fall, availability of alternative and remunerative employment opportunities outside Mahatma Gandhi NREGS.</p>
      <p>An additional 50 days of wage employment is provided over and above 100 days in the notified drought affected areas or natural calamity areas in the country on recommendation of the ministry of agriculture and farmers welfare.</p>
      <p>In another reply, Tomar said a total number of 84 Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) projects has so far been sanctioned for implementation in 24 states with a target of coverage of 33.81 lakhs mahila kisans.</p>
      <p>As on September 30, 2019, 36.06 lakhs mahila kisans have been covered in 30,900 villages. So far Rs 847.48 crore has been allocated for the programme out of which Rs 579.76 crore has been released.</p>
