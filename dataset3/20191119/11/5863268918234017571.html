      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Information and Broadcasting Dr. Firdous Ashiq Awan Tuesday prayed for former PM Nawaz Sharif’s wellbeing.</p>
      <p>“May Allah give health to Nawaz Sharif so that he could face the law after returning to the country,” the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader tweeted.</p>
      <p>“PM Imran Khan has set a bright example of humanity and rule of law through his conduct. The premier is pursuing the mission of national development and prosperity.</p>
      <p>“Significant actions will unfold in the coming days for people’s relief as facilities for the masses will start increasing along with the economic restoration.</p>
      <p>“Imran Khan has always defeated his opponents and will continue to do so. There is mafia on one hand and people are standing under Imran Khan’s leadership on the other.”</p>
