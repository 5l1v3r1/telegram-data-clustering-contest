      <h1>Emre Can’s comments about Juventus show he was wrong to leave Liverpool</h1>
      <h2>The German midfielder said he left to win the Champions League and missed the Reds securing it last season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:15:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool midfielder Emre Can is not happy about his lack of gametime with Juventus, in his second season after leaving Anfield.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/emre-can-explains-left-liverpool-14885068">Liverpool Echo</a> quoted him in 2018 as saying he left Anfield to win the Champions League but had to watch on as his old team-mates lifted the famous old trophy without him in Madrid in June.</p>
      <p>And now he’s <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/emre-can-liverpool-juventus-news-17275588">said to Kicker via the Echo</a>: “I’m not playing games from the start, so I’m not happy, but I will stay strong and keep working on myself. I’m also learning from this tough time when things are not going the way I was hoping.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Can should regret leaving Liverpool</h3>
      <p>Perhaps Can saw the money lighting up in front of his eyes when he was a free agent and potential suitors could use some of the cash they would save on his transfer fee to put into his wage packet.</p>
      <p>Juventus made a serious commitment to winning Europe’s top trophy by signing Cristiano Ronaldo, and lift Serie A on a regular basis, so maybe that’s a harsh assessment.</p>
      <p>But as many of Can’s old team-mates boast Champions League medals while he sits on the bench in Italy, it’s likely he regrets turning down that contract offer at Anfield.</p>
