      <h3>SECURITY officers of Toll Plaza Skyway arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly kidnapping their compatriot Monday evening in Pasay City.</h3>
      <p>Pasay City police chief P/Col. Bernard Yang said Li Gen, 32, He Xiang, 29 and Wang Jun, 29, who were all staying at  2210 Burgundy Hotel, Sen. Gil Puyat Avenue, Makati City will be charged for kidnapping of their fellow Chinese identified as Zhou Zheng Qiang, 26, tourist and staying at 7556 Santillan St., Bgy. Pio, Del Pilar, Makati city.</p>
      <p>Investigation showed that while security officers Roden Leobert Perez and Randy Castillo were performing their duties at the westbound lane of Skyway in front of NAIA Terminal 3, Villamor Airbase at around 8:15 p.m., they spotted Wang driving a Chevrolet van with license plate number TOJ-216 without a seat belt.</p>
      <p>When the two flagged down the car, they saw Li Gen and He Xiang beating up the victim at the back seat.</p>
      <p>When Perez asked what was happening, the victim managed to get out of the car and told the security officers he was kidnapped by the suspects who were forcing him to pay a P1 million interest from his debt.</p>
      <p>With the help of an interpreter, the victim told police that he was given P1 million loan by the suspects which he used to play and lost in a casino.</p>
      <p>He only returned the P80,000 and with the help of his relatives, he was able to pay the P1 million he borrowed but the suspects were asking him to shell out another P1 million for the interest until he was abducted in a hotel in Makati.</p>
