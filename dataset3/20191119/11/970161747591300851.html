      <p>Jane McDonald has given I’m a Celeb’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts her seal of approval after discovering she was the campmate’s luxury item – while watching in shock in her pants.</p>
      <p>The TV and singing icon called in to This Morning to discuss her shock inclusion in this year’s Australian camp, after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">Adele revealed she’d brought in a framed photo of Jane</a> to keep her spirits up.</p>
      <p>Declaring the star a ‘national treasure’, Adele said: ‘She is the queen of Wakefield.</p>

      <p>‘Just think, whenever you’re going off to a trial, just give her a lucky rub and off you go.’</p>
      <p>While viewers were baffled (but absolutely loved the random item), Jane has now spoken out about the moment and said that she is now excited to meet her radio DJ superfan.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Holly and Phil, she said: ‘I’m absolutely gobsmacked! I was just like… my phone started going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!</p>
      <p>‘I was sat, because I’ve been sitting here filming in Manchester.</p>
      <p>‘I just sat on the edge of the bed in my underwear, and watched it on Plus One, and just thought, “oh my goodness me!” I could not believe it.’</p>

      <p>Despite Adele’s clear fondness for the star, it’s revealed that the pair have never actually met before, but Jane added: ‘But I want to now!’</p>
      <p>Thankfully for Jane, that’s the closest she’s ever going to get in the jungle, and she laughed off her ever taking part herself.</p>
      <p>‘I just love that, that is absolutely my perfect visit into the jungle, isn’t it,’ she laughed.  ‘I don’t have to do anything, I’m just there.’</p>

      <p>‘Oh no! I don’t think [I’ll ever do it],’ she said. ‘It’s not for me that, love. I need a hairdryer, and me without make-up? Not attractive, not attractive at all.’</p>
