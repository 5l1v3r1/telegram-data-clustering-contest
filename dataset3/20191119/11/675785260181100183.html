      <p>A lottery winner's dream of being a mum has come true after she used some of her windfall to help her become pregnant.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Brown, 39, from Nottingham, won £1 million back in August 2016 as part of a family syndicate with dad David, 64, mum Yvonne, 62, and sister Julie.</p>
      <p>She used some of her £250,000 share for two rounds of IVF and now the 39-year-old is due to give birth in January as a happily single mum.</p>
      <p>Rebecca, who is a nurse, was told by doctors she may need to have a hysterectomy so should "have children sooner, rather than later" after she was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells of the cervix last year, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/ivf-pregnancy-dream-comes-true-3548983">Nottinghamshire Live</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was poorly last year and I thought, I want to do it, I’ve got to. I was able to pay for it so I did.</p>

      <p>"I always thought I might have wanted children but I was never motivated enough to make it happen.</p>
      <p>"The hospital told me if I wanted to have children I had to do it sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>"Then at my last check up they said they might have to do a hysterectomy so that’s when I said to them, if I don’t have to have it, I’m going to have a baby.</p>
      <p>"My dad said 'But you need a man first'</p>

      <p>"I said, no I don’t."</p>
      <p>Rebecca, who is seven months pregnant, is choosing to keep the gender a surprise.</p>
      <p>"We do refer to it as a boy and call it Percy but whether it ends up being a Percy remains to be seen," she said.</p>
      <p>The baby will be her parent's first grandchild and every one is excited about the new arrival.</p>

      <p>“I don’t want it to be spoilt but everyone has been really generous," Rebecca said.</p>
      <p>"Not just mum and dad but my friends and my neighbour.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has been really generous in giving me things and buying me things for the baby."</p>
      <p>Mum Yvonne added: "This baby is going to be brought up normal, it should be like these were brought up.</p>
      <p>"Birthday? Yes. Christmas? Yes. That’s when you get presents. You don’t just have things when you want it."</p>
      <p>The Brown family have been playing the lottery since it began in November 1994.</p>
