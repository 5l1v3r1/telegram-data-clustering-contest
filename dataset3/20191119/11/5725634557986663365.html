      <p>The equity market has played an early role in sustainable investing, while bond markets have lagged in data, tools and insights. But that's changing fast, as we detail in a new publication: <i><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/esg-fixed-income?cid=synd:SA:Gettingsustainableinfixedincome">Sustainability: the bond that endures</a></i>. New ESG indexes have created building blocks that can be used to bring sustainability into the core of portfolios, even in asset classes such as emerging market (EM) debt that until recently lacked sustainable solutions.</p>

      <p>Source: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from MSCI, Sustainalytics and Refinitiv, October 2019. Notes: The chart shows BlackRock's estimate of the financial materiality (or relative importance, in percentage terms) of E, S and G factors in driving performance in global equities and credit market over January 2015 through June 2019. We use regression analysis to estimate the relationship between each ESG pillar and monthly excess returns over the period. Equities analysis is based on the MSCI World Developed index. Bonds are based on credit spread returns of the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate credit index. For illustrative purposes only.</p>
      <p>Sustainable investing is the combination of traditional investment approaches with environmental, social and governance (ESG) insights. The "E" includes climate risks, "S" covers labor issues and product liability risks, and "G" refers to topics such as corporate board quality and effectiveness. What ESG factors really move the dial in financial performance? Organizations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) have taken the lead in investigating which sustainability topics are most relevant across industries. Our quantitative work builds on such studies, extending the analysis to global equities and credit. A key conclusion: Market pricing suggests each of the three ESG pillars are of roughly similar levels of importance in both credit and equity markets, as the chart shows.</p>
      <p>The need for sustainable fixed income solutions is growing: Bonds are in high demand - against a backdrop of aging populations in search of income and geopolitical volatility that has sparked greater demand for "safe" assets. We believe fixed income investors can draw on many of the insights that equity-focused research has produced on ESG. Companies or issuers with strong ESG performance are likely to be better at managing operational and reputational risks. Yet there are nuances to sustainable investing in bonds. Sovereign debt requires a different approach, as we detail in <i>Sustainability: the bond that endures</i>. And in contrast to equities, fixed income investors' main focus is often on mitigating downside risk, rather than capturing upside potential. We believe ESG metrics can help identify new risk factors.</p>
      <p>The materiality of each of the ESG pillars varies across industries. Take financials. The "E" pillar appears to have more sway on market pricing than commonly thought. We found a meaningful link between returns on banks' corporate debt and "E" factors such as low carbon transition. Why is this the case even though bank operations have little direct exposure to environmental factors? Bank loans to fossil fuel producers may be at risk of future losses in a scenario in which carbon taxes are introduced, for example. We believe such analysis on an industry level can help inform investment decisions. Investors may want to consider tilting toward (or away from) ESG exposures that are most financially relevant in each industry, for example. Drilling deeper on ESG metrics - and utilizing new data sources - can also inform risk management. Previous work we have done shows that "E" factors, such as extreme weather, pose tangible risks to long dated assets - from electric utilities and commercial real estate to municipal bonds. See <i><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/physical-climate-risks?cid=synd:SA:Gettingsustainableinfixedincome">Getting physical: assessing climate risks</a></i> for more.</p>
      <p>The <i>"why not?" moment</i> in sustainable investing has arrived in fixed income as well. Investors can now use sustainable building blocks to integrate sustainability across equities <i>and</i> fixed income allocations. Our analysis suggests that ESG indexes offer similar risk/return properties to traditional benchmarks, while adding a dose of portfolio resilience. See <i><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/insights/blackrock-investment-institute/sustainability-the-future-of-investing?cid=synd:SA:Gettingsustainableinfixedincome">Sustainability: the future of investing</a></i> for more. ESG-related risks such as the rising frequency and intensity of hurricanes are likely to compound over time. The flip side is potential opportunities in areas such as renewable energy. Bottom line: Investors now have the tools to integrate critical ESG factors in fixed income.</p>

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.</b> <br/>Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from Refinitiv Datastream, November 2019. Notes: The two ends of the bars show the lowest and highest returns versus the end of 2018, and the dots represent year-to-date returns. Emerging market (EM), high yield and global corporate investment grade (IG) returns are denominated in U.S. dollars, and the rest in local currencies.

Morgan EMBI index.</p>
      <h3>Market backdrop</h3>
      <p>A perceived lull in geopolitical frictions has boosted risk assets. We are on the watch for more signs that global manufacturing may be bottoming out, and for signs that the drag on economic activity from the global protectionist push is spreading beyond manufacturing. Markets have tempered expectations of further Fed rate cuts, suggesting the dovish pivot by major central banks has run its course for now. Monetary policy is no cure for the weaker growth and firmer inflation pressures that may result from sustained trade tensions. We expect growth to stabilize over the next 6 to 12 months, fueled in part by loose financial conditions. See our macro data dashboard.</p>
      <h3>Week ahead</h3>
      <p><b>Nov. 22</b> - Markets will scrutinize the PMI data across the euro area and the U.S. for signs of stabilizing growth, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The global manufacturing sector has begun to show signs of bottoming out. We see global growth stabilizing thanks to a lull in trade tensions and easier financial conditions.</p>
