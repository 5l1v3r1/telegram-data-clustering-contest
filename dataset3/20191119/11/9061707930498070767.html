      <p>Derby County return to Championship action at home to Preston North End this weekend - the first of nine Championship matches for the Rams before the January transfer window opens.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a look at the best and worst-case scenarios that could play out during January.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Best-case scenario</b>
      </p>
      <p>This will be <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> bolstering the three or four positions in the team, and the squad, that need attention due to injuries and the form of individuals.</p>
      <p>Centre back is an obvious department to look at due to the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-richard-keogh-sacked-3531705">Richard Keogh</a> situation as well as <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-dealt-fresh-injury-3520371">Matt Clarke's</a> injury.</p>
      <p>Keogh, out for more than a year due to a serious knee injury, has had his contract terminated for gross misconduct, although he has lodged an appeal.</p>
      <p>Clarke picked up a knee injury in the defeat by Nottingham Forest in Derby's last game. The full extent of the problem has yet to be confirmed, but manager <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-phillip-cocu-feyenoord-3549224">Phillip Cocu</a> admitted it did not look good.</p>
      <p>A spell on the sidelines is expected, leaving Cocu to find a partner for Curtis Davies at the heart of his defence.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It is also important to factor in that Davies, who is 34, missed virtually all of last season due to injuries. It would be a big ask for him to be ever-present from now until the end of the campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-krystian-bielik-3454473">Krystian Bielik</a> could drop back into defence from midfield, while midfielder George Evans, and full backs Andre Wisdom and Craig Forsyth could be other options.</p>

      <p>One or two recognised central defenders coming through the door in January would help, as would the addition of a wide attacker/winger, preferably right-sided.</p>
      <p>Harry Wilson pretty much made the position is own during his loan from Liverpool last season, but nobody in the squad has managed to nail down the role this season, so far.</p>
      <p>Filling the position was a priority in the summer when Derby eyed the likes of Jordon Ibe, Jacob Murphy, Grady Diangana, Fousseni Diabaté and Sergi Canos.</p>
      <p>Adding to the team's creativity and goals' return would also help, although we must not forget that Wayne Rooney will be available in January.</p>
      <p>Also, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-investment-mel-morris-3551271">new investment</a> could be in place by the end of the year. How much difference that could make remains to be seen, but it is unlikely to mean Derby will 'go mad' in the January window, nor should they.</p>

      <p>
        <b>Worst-case scenario</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not adding at least one central defender would be a surprise because it is such a key area of the team.</p>
      <p>It would also be a gamble to tackle the second half of the season with any concerns over the position.</p>
      <p>But January is a tricky window for clubs, it can be fraught with problems. Desire or urgency to strengthen can lead to mistakes.</p>
      <p>Recent January windows have not really worked for Derby, not many of the additions have made a significant impact.</p>
      <p>Rams boss Phillip Cocu has shown himself to be a calm customer.</p>
      <p>He will view the squad, he will know what is needed but he will only make a move if new signings can make a difference rather than just adding to numbers.</p>
      <p>Cocu does not strike me as a manager to panic in a transfer window.</p>
