      <p>From Bon Appétit's November 2019 issue: A Thanksgiving recipe from Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz:</p>
      <p>Bon Appetit"These roasted whole brussels sprouts get so crispy on the outside you'll worry they're burnt (they're not!). Inside though, they're perfectly, deliciously mushy – which, according to us, isn't a bad thing.</p>
      <p>"Of course, it gets even better when you coat them in a date molasses-brown butter glaze. Typically made from dates and nothing else, date molasses has a thick consistency and brings a deep, fruity sweetness and a bit of tartness.

      <h3>       <br/>Brussels Sprouts With Pistachios and Lime</h3>
      <p>Recipe by Christina Chaey and Claire Saffitz<br/>Makes 8–10 servings</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>2 lb. small brussels sprouts, trimmed<br/>3 Tbsp. vegetable oil<br/>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper<br/>3 Tbsp. unsalted butter<br/>3 Tbsp. raw pistachios<br/>2 Tbsp. date molasses or honey<br/>1 tsp. honey<br/>Zest of ½ lime<br/>2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice<br/>½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes<br/>Lime wedges (for serving; optional) </p>
      <p>
        <i>Preparation:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 450°. Toss brussels sprouts and oil in a large bowl to coat; season with salt and pepper. Roast brussels sprouts on a rimmed baking sheet 15 minutes, then shake baking sheet to loosen them. Continue to roast until deeply browned all over, 5–10 minutes longer. Reduce oven temperature to 350° and roast another 10 minutes. Shake baking sheet again, then roast brussels sprouts until the tip of a small knife easily slides through, 5–10 minutes longer (total cook time will be 35–45 minutes).</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Once butter starts to foam, add pistachios and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, until nuts are golden brown and butter solids are browned, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Using a slotted spoon, transfer nuts to paper towels; let cool. Coarsely chop.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring date molasses, honey, and lime juice to a simmer in same skillet over medium heat (this will happen quickly), swirling pan to emulsify. Add 1 Tbsp. water and swirl to emulsify, scraping up browned bits with a wooden spoon. Add brussels sprouts; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Transfer brussels sprouts to a platter. Toss nuts, lime zest, red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt in a small bowl to combine; scatter over brussels sprouts. Serve with lime wedges if desired.</li>
        <li><b>Do Ahead:</b> Brussels sprouts, glaze (without water), and pistachio mixture can all be made 3 hours ahead. Do not combine. Reheat glaze over medium heat until bubbling before adding water and brussels sprouts.</li>
      </ul>
