      <p>KT was a fans' favourite at his boyhood heroes and was a key man in the their treble treble success.</p>
      <p>The left-back has since traded life in the family home to living himself in London.</p>
      <p>He admits the transition has been difficult but he's been made to feel at home by the Scottish staff on the Arsenal books - who share his love for <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Celtic.</a></p>
      <p>And says he has created bonds with the likes of Hector Bellerin, Dino Mavropanos, Callum Chambers and Rob Holding.</p>

      <p>Speaking to Pro Direct Soccer, he said: "It was a hard transition. I lived with my family right until I had to move.</p>
      <p>"It's been in the house myself, doing the cooking and washing.</p>
      <p>"Because I’ve been injured and Bellerin was injured and Big Dino as well, I’ve been close with them.</p>
      <p>“Hector is a big voice in the changing room as well so he’s helped me settle in. Rob Holding and Calum Chambers as well have looked after me.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to say though because everyone has been great, even the staff.</p>
      <p>"There’s a few Scottish staff as well – Celtic fans – so they’ve helped me settle in and make me feel at home.”</p>
