        <b>Munster have issued an injury update ahead of their Heineken Champions Cup clash with Racing 92 at Thomond Park on Saturday (KO 5.30 pm).</b>
      </p>
      <p>The southern province enter this game off the back of a bonus-point 32-13 over the Ospreys at the Liberty Stadium.</p>
      <p>The Parisian side also secured a bonus-point in their match with Saracens at the Paris La Défense Arena which sets up a mouth-watering encounter with Munster on Saturday.</p>
      <p>This weekend should also see the return of Simon Zebo and Donnacha Ryan to the Limerick venue which adds another level of spice to the occasion.</p>
      <p>Munster will be going into this game sweating on the fitness of JJ Hanrahan. The Kerry native missed the win over the Ospreys with a hamstring injury he picked the week previously against Ulster.</p>

      <p>However, the southern province have confirmed that Hanrahan will be reintegrated into training this week which puts him in contention for Saturday’s evening kick-off.</p>
      <p>The same applies to hooker Rhys Marshall who has been struggling with a knee problem.</p>
      <p>Players continuing to rehab include Chris Cloete (RTPP), Dave Kilcoyne (calf), Joey Carbery (Ankle) Ciaran Parker (calf) and Darren Sweetnam (hamstring).</p>
      <p>Saturday’s match will also be the last game for Alby Mathewson. The<i><a href="https://punditarena.com/rugby/smcmahon/alby-mathewson-farewell-munster-weekend/"> southern province confirmed</a></i> that the Kiwi scrum-half will be departing the southern province at the end of the month.</p>
