      <h1>Soccer Mommy Confronts Loss on "yellow is the color of her eyes," Announces 2020 Tour</h1>
      <h2>The new single arrives alongside an Alex Ross Perry-directed video</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:00</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Gersten  </a></address>
      <p>Sophie Allison, aka Soccer Mommy, released her first single since 2018’s <i>Clean</i>, “<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/09/soccer-mommy-new-song-lucy.html">lucy</a>,” back in September. The tense but sparkly five-minute track was one of her darkest yet, finding her confronting her worst impulses in a dance with a shiny-eyed Lucifer. Her newest effort, “yellow is the color of eyes,” kicks everything up a notch—sonically, visually and emotionally. Over seven minutes long, it boasts a visual from <i>Her Smell</i> director Alex Ross Perry (who also recently teamed up with <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2019/09/vivian-girls-share-sludge-video-directed-by-alex-r.html">Vivian Girls</a>), plus harp and pedal steel from Mary Lattimore and Brett Resnick, respectively.</p>
      <p>”’yellow is the color of her eyes’ is a song that is really important to me,” explains Allison. “The song was inspired by a time when I was on the road constantly and I felt like I was losing time—specifically with my mother. It’s also a song that I feel really showcases my writing when it comes to instrumentation, so it’s one that makes me really proud.“ Perry’s yellow-hued video shows Allison walking alone by the water, until she finally takes a plunge and capsizes. “In her eyes like clementines I know that she’s fading,” sings Allison. “Loving you isn’t enough / You’ll still be deep in the ground when it’s done.”</p>
      <p>In a statement, Perry shared the video’s cinematic influences:</p>
      <p>The challenge of creating a seven-minute piece was daunting and irresistible in equal measure. Having just completed a film for which the color-coded design of it’s [sic] various acts was of the utmost importance, Sophie’s idea of collaborating on a short-form film to compliment her similarly-conceived new music was irresistible.</p>
      <p>Running with her idea of locations evoking where she wrote this song, the concept couldn’t have announced itself more boldly. To that, I shared images from <i>Breaking the Waves</i> and <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>. It wasn’t until we got the footage back that I realized a dash of first-scene-of-<i>Inception</i> had snuck in there, as well.</p>
      <p>Soccer Mommy has also announced a 2020 tour, with a Seated presale beginning tomorrow (Nov. 20) at 10 a.m., a Spotify presale from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursday and general on-sale beginning Friday at 10 a.m. Tickets will be available <a href="https://soccermommyband.com/tour/">here</a>.
