      <p>We chatted to the newly minted millionaire about his win, his upcoming album and ask his advice for future contestants.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What does it feel like to be the winner of South African Idols?</b>
      </p>
      <p>It feels great, fantastic, awesome! It's a blessing. I really appreciate this moment and experience.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you thought about what you will be doing with your cash prize?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I still have to think about what I will be doing with my cash prize. I never thought I was going to win Idols so I didn’t have any plans like other people may do. I feel like I have to make wise decisions, it is a lot of money. I can’t be thinking of buying, buying, buying. I have to focus.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You have been away from home for some time now. What is the first thing you want to do when you get home?</b>
      </p>
      <p>First thing I want to do when I get home is to rest. I feel like it's going to be very a little bit intense and that's what I want; I want the hectic life, however, I need some rest just to clear my mind in terms of coming out of the show, even if it's one day and then get back to work. I have to work and push hard.</p>
      <p>
        <b>When can fans expect your next song or album? Any ideas when you will start working it?</b>
      </p>
      <p>At the moment I am still pushing my single, <i>Sunshine Through The Rain</i>. I will start working on the album soon and it will hopefully be released next year. </p>

        <b>Idols SA has been renewed for season 16. For future contestants auditioning, what’s some advice you would give to them?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The one piece of advice I would give to future contestants is to focus on yourself. There's nothing more that can throw you off than focusing on other people even if you feel that the person sings better than you. Focus on bettering yourself and a lot will happen.</p>
