      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mary-berry/">Mary Berry</a>’s Christmas special is set to get the Royal treatment as she teams up with Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The princess became pals with the 84-year-old cookery legend in 2013 and is now, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/mary-berry-teams-up-kate-20892400">according to The Mirror</a>, heading to the kitchen with her friend to serve up some festive treats.</p>
      <p>In a one-off episode set to air next month in time for the holidays, the show will be named the Mary Berry Royal Christmas Show, and will reportedly air on the BBC.</p>
      <p>‘Between them they will bring seasonal goodwill to their guests and to the millions of viewers watching,’ a source told the paper. ‘Expect a properly uplifting Christmas treat.’</p>
      <p>
        <i>The BBC declined to comment when approached by Metro.co.uk. </i>
      </p>
      <p>Mary has become a beloved household name thanks to her time in the Great British Bake Off – with the Duchess reportedly becoming a fan of her cookbooks.</p>

      <p>Most recently, Kate was seen with husband Prince William, Duke of Cambridge at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/duke-duchess-cambridge-enjoy-glamorous-night-royal-variety-performance-11178431/">annual Royal Variety performance</a> last night.</p>
      <p>The event is in aid of the Royal Variety Charity – or The Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund – of which Queen Elizabeth is Patron.</p>
      <p>The money raised from the show will help hundreds of entertainers throughout the UK who need help as a result of old age, ill-health, or hard times.</p>
      <p>They had previously appeared in 2014 and 2017.</p>
      <p>The performance is hosted by comedians Rob Beckett and Romesh Ranganathan and includes a special collaboration by Emeli Sandé and Manchester’s Bee Vocal choir.</p>
