        <b>Bayer and Merck &amp; Co/MSD raised some eyebrows three years ago when they started a phase 3 programme for chronic heart failure (CHF) candidate vericiguat, but the gamble seems to have paid off.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first pivotal trial of the oral soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator – <u><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02861534">VICTORIA</a></u> – showed that vericiguat was able to reduce the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure or cardiovascular death compared to placebo in patients with worsening CHF.</p>
      <p>The top-line readout suggests Merck and Bayer’s gamble on vericiguat looks like it may have paid off. In 2016 they opted to move ahead with the phase 3 trial despite <u><a href="http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/bayer_and_merck_take_high-risk_heart_failure_drug_into_phase_iii_1148786">mixed results</a></u> in the phase 2 SOCRATES-REDUCED trial.</p>
      <p>The big question now is just how much vericiguat reduced that compositive endpoint in the near 5,000-patient study, which involved patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), characterised by a compromised ability of the heart to eject blood sufficiently.</p>
      <p>If vericiguat can show a sufficiently large benefit on top of standard therapy it could open up a sizeable market opportunity, albeit potentially one that take some time to gather momentum – as witnessed by the slow take-up of Novartis’ Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) after its launch for CHF in 2015.</p>
      <p>Entresto entered the blockbuster category with sales of $1bn last year from its use in HFrEF, but Novartis’ hopes that it could enter the multibillion-dollar bracket took a knock in the summer when it fluffed a pivotal trial in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) – which accounts for at least as many heart failure patients as HFrEF but currently has no approved therapies.</p>
      <p>Bayer and Merck are also conducting a phase 2 trial of vericiguat in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) which is scheduled for completion by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Another question for vericiguat is how it will stack up against SGLT2 inhibitors such as Boehringer Ingelheim/Eli Lilly’s Jardiance (empagliflozin) and AstraZeneca’s Farxiga (dapagliflozin).</p>
      <p>These are starting to find a role in heart failure, initially to reduce risk in patients with type 2 diabetes but latterly also in CHF without diabetes.</p>

      <p>“We see our novel action mode with the opportunity to demonstrate value where others can't go, for example in post-event patients or in patients with worsening heart failure,” he added.</p>
      <p>At the moment there are no studies involving SGLT2 inhibitors that have competed in worsening heart failure, he suggested but added: “Let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is a new class, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we actually establish a new class to be effective in the treatment of heart failure, which still let's not forget is one of the primary killers worldwide overall.”</p>
      <p>sGC stimulators are thought to work by correcting a dysfunctional nitric oxide signalling pathway seen in heart failure.The results of the VICTORIA study will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting in 2020, said Merck and Bayer.</p>
