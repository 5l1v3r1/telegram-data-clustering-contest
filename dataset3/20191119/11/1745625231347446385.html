      <p>Reality television star <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/mike-sorrentino/">Mike Sorrentino</a>‘s wife Lauren has suffered a heartbreaking miscarriage. The <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/jersey-shore/"><i>Jersey Shore Family Vacation</i></a> stars spoke about how they are coping with their loss during an interview on the daily talk series <i>GMA3: <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/michael-strahan/">Strahan</a>, Sarah &amp; Keke</i>.</p>
      <p>“The night he came home, we actually conceived,” said Lauren of the couple reuniting at the completion of Mike’s eight-month prison sentence for tax evasion and finding out shortly after they were expecting. The reality star revealed she had been carefully watching her ovulation cycles reported <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Strahan_Sara_and_Keke/mike-situation-sorrentino-wife-lauren-open-miscarriage/story?id=67105073"><i>ABC News,</i></a> “And then at about six-and-a-half, seven weeks, I miscarried.”</p>
      <p>“When I found out we were <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/pregnancy/">pregnant</a> I felt like this is why we went through all these challenges for years and that this was our time and it was our blessing,” Lauren said of the difficulties the couple has faced together in their relationship as they worked through Mike’s past drug addiction, recovery, trial for tax evasion, sentencing and subsequent jail time.</p>
      <p>“It was hard. It was really difficult,” Lauren stated.</p>
      <p>College sweethearts Mike and Lauren <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5723614/jersey-shore-mike-sorrentino-wedding-anniversary/">married</a> in November 2018 and were eager to start a family right away, but their plans were derailed when Mike turned himself in to authorities in January 2019 to begin his prison sentence. The couple was reunited in September of this year, which is when they conceived their first child.</p>
      <p>Lauren said she wanted to tell her story as a way to help other families who might be going through the same heartbreak. She also explained that she wanted to be honest with what she has experienced in order to be able to heal.</p>
