From Yamuna Expressway case to Shakti Mills case and several other cases form the backbone of the gritty script of <i>Mardaani 2</i>. It is a hard-hitting, edgy, close to reality film and, obviously, there will be a lot of similarities from the actual events that happened in India. The writer (Gopi Puthran) has particularly invested time to research on juvenile criminals and the horrific crimes they have committed against women in India. One such incident is the Shakti Mills case, one of the earliest reported cases of violent crimes like rape that were committed by juveniles,” says an informer.</p>
      <p>When contacted to enquire about the same, Gopi Puthran, the writer-director of Mardaani 2 says, “If you are finding uncanny similarities with the heinous crimes committed against women across our country, it is because <i>Mardaani 2</i> as a film is a mirror of the society to audiences. Violent crime committed against women by juveniles are on the rise and the plot line of Mardaani 2 is inspired by such events that have rocked our nation. This is our way of showing everyone what is really happening around us and trying to tell everyone to keep their eyes open because the threat is around us. We need to be vigilant and aware and extremely cautious because the culprit cannot be recognised because of his age.”</p>

She had delivered an knock-out performance in the superhit and hugely acclaimed prequel, Mardaani, in which she took on<i>Mardaani 2</i> focusses on the rise in violent crimes by juveniles in India and has definitely sparked a conversation on the threat this poses on young girls. the kingpin of a child trafficking racket. In <i>Mardaani 2</i>, Rani has been pitted against a very young yet dangerous villain who can be called pure evil.</p>
