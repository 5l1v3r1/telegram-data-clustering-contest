      <p>Now that <i>Sword &amp; Shield</i> is out, fans are free to pick through the game’s code, and of course one of the first things that’s being done is the addition of <a href="http://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/07/why-pokemon-fans-are-so-mad-about-sword-and-shield">some Pokémon that didn’t actually make it into the game</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/SciresM">SciresM </a>from <a href="https://projectpokemon.org/">Project Pokémon</a> has posted some video showing off the work he’s done so far, by adding an Omastar to <i>Sword &amp; Shield’s</i> Pokedex, then having it enter a battle.</p>

      <p>The model and animations were imported from <i>Pokémon: Let’s Go</i>, and the most important thing here is that the Omastar was added to the game as an all-new entry whose stats can be edited, not just a replacement for a Pokémon already in the game. So <i>theoretically</i>, you could keep adding Pokémon and flesh out <i>Sword &amp; Shield’s</i> Pokédex, with the biggest problem coming from the fact that while it’s relatively easy to import models from <i>Pokémon: Let’s Go</i>, adding other Pokemon from later games would take a ton of work to get stuff like their animations working properly.</p>
      <p>This is a good start! It’s far from a seamless fit, but to get something like this working so well so quickly after release—SciresM <a href="https://twitter.com/SciresM/status/1196341918600318976">says </a>“To be clear, this is the <i>Let’s Go</i> model imported with literally no changes on my part”—points to good things being done in this space in the weeks and months to come.</p>
      <p>Obviously all this work is being done on PC, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-nintendo-switch-emulator-for-the-pc-might-finally-1838779028">which is able to run many Switch games in let’s say an unofficial capacity</a>.</p>
