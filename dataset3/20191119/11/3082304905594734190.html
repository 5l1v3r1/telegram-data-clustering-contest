        <b>Amidst ongoing interest from Manchester United, Juventus star Emre Can has revealed that he is frustrated due to the lack of game time under Maurizio Sarri.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“I’m just an ambitious guy who always wants to compete at the highest level, but I’m also learning from this tough time when things are not going the way I was hoping,” Can told <i>Kicker</i>.</p>
      <p>“I’m not playing games from the start, so I’m not happy, but I will stay strong and keep working on myself.”</p>
      <p>“I’m often in the gym before or after training, doing extra shifts. I want to be ready,” he further added, before concluding:</p>
      <p>“A lot can always happen in football.”</p>
      <p>The German midfielder joined the <i>Bianconeri </i>from Liverpool in 2018, on a free transfer. Although he made 37 appearances for them in the 2018-19 season, he has been restricted to just four appearances – all four of them coming in the Serie A –  so far in the ongoing 2019-20 season.</p>
      <p>And on Monday, it was reported that the 25-year-old could be offloaded to Manchester United, as part of a player-plus-cash deal for superstar midfielder Paul Pogba.</p>
      <p>It has also been understood that Bundesliga clubs Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund are interested in him as well.</p>
