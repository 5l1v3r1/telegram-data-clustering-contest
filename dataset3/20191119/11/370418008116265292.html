      <p>If we trace back nu-metal’s genesis to <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/korns-self-titled-debut-made-me-the-metalhead-i-am-today/">Korn’s debut album</a>, then the subgenre celebrated its 25th anniversary this year. The self-titled effort from the Bakersfield dreadlock merchants laid the foundations for an entire movement within heavy music, mixing heavy bass and hip-hop sensibilities with crunching riffs and uncontrollable angst.</p>
      <p>Korn gave way to countless bands, some of which went on to achieve greatness within the world of metal. Slipknot, Linkin Park, Deftones, Limp Bizkit… household names amongst those who like their music heavy, all pushing boundaries of what it meant to be ‘metal’ in the late ’90s/early ’00s.</p>
      <p>The scene is much maligned these days, seen as a bit of a dirty mark in the rich history of metal. But it’s hard to ignore the impact and influence some of these albums had. <i>Everyone</i> knows the dance to Rollin’, <i>everyone</i> knows all the words to In The End, <i>everyone</i> was terrified and incensed by the Wait And Bleed video.</p>
      <p>But which nu-metal album rules them all? Have your say in the snazzy widget below.</p>
      <p>Please format your answer like <b>Band Name – Album Name</b> or it may not be counted.</p>
