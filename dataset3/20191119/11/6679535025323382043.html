      <h2>Film stars Karthikeya of 'RX100' fame and the storyline revolves around liquor and romance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:14:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Y-Sunita-Chowdhary-6504/" target="_blank">Y Sunita Chowdhary</a></address>
      <p>Shekar Reddy displays an enthusiasm of a debutant and the confidence of a veteran as he awaits the release of his film <i>90 ML</i>. The film stars <i>RX100</i> fame Karthikeya. While informing that this film has no connection to the Tamil film <i>90 ml</i>, Shekar shares details of his film,. “Director Ajay of <i>RX100</i> is my friend and he helped me meet Karthikeya. I was ready with my story in 2016, which is a commercial entertainer. As you guessed, <i>90 ml</i> is connected to liquor. In the promo one can see the hero saying the doctor advised him to drink 90 ml only — which is half of a quarter. I can't reveal anything more. There is no connection to the Tamil film <i>90 ml</i>. Any movie begins with a small triggering point that drives the story to a conflict. Here there is a youth who can’t survive without drinking liquor and when a girl enters his life, he faces insurmountable problems. How he rectifies by regulating and controlling his dosage is the story.”</p>

      <p>When Shekar Reddy narrated the story to Karthikeya, he and his family were impressed and decided to produce it. Karthikeya is bound to become a mass hero with this project he says. The film was shot in Hyderabad in 80 days. Television actress Neha Solanki plays the heroine. The cast is huge with all the big names and Chandra Bose had written all the songs. Three songs have been shot in Azerbeijan and the locations have added value to the over all look of the film, states the director.</p>
      <p>A childhood passion for films saw Shekar Reddy dream further who was inspired by the interviews of directors he would read. Their struggles, specially their journeys from their native villages to Hyderabad gave him a lot to think about. He shares, “I would constantly question myself that if I am already in Hyderabad and when I am a local, where was the need to worry so much. Till then the desire to be a director was there but after that it became stronger. I worked for a few films as an assistant director and also as an associate director and I began my direction trials after that stint.”</p>
      <p>Shekar Reddy feels it is pointless working for many years as an AD or as an associate and one should begin to progress. Learning is a never ending process and he began writing while on the sets. Once he started meeting producers, they would ask if he worked with a popular or a big director. The question wouldn’t baffle him because he saw it was coming. "If a director is successful and has a couple of big hits behind him, there is value for assistants working with him. The producers study that graph and get that confidence that this man can direct well. If you work with small directors, they wonder if they can handle big budget films."</p>
      <p>Shekar likes to believe that good days have arrived for him and there’s a lot he can look forward to in the Telugu film industry.</p>
