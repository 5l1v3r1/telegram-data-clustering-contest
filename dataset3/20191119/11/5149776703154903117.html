      <p>More than 30 temporary jobs are up for grabs in Nottingham as same-day distribution firm CitySprint gears up for the busy <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> period.</p>
      <p>The company says it has a "specific focus" on people in the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-city-centre">city</a> as it looks to boost the number of van couriers.</p>
      <p>The peak season for deliveries normally runs from the end of October until the New Year, with CitySprint making more than 600,000 deliveries during that period last year.</p>
      <p>Paul Gisbourne, chief operating officer at CitySprint, said: “With just 36 days to go until Christmas, businesses are gearing up for the busiest time of the year.</p>
      <p>"Bolstering fleet numbers will allow us to continue to deliver a first-class service and ensures we stay ahead of our competitors.</p>
      <p>"We know that the Christmas season brings increased pressure, demand and competition for our customers, which is why we are committed to going the extra mile at a time when it matters most.”</p>
      <p>People interested in applying for more of the temporary courier jobs can find more information on CitySprint's website.</p>
