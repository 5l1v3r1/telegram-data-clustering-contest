        <b>Manchester United are reportedly ready to put potential deals for Mario Mandzukic and Declan Rice on the back-burner and focus on a double January transfer window swoop for Jadon Sancho and Erling Haaland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This big claim comes from <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-ready-to-spend-big-on-sancho-and-haaland-in-january/5nnf2uw06tag15uyshqnoic49">Goal</a>, who report that the Red Devils are confident a deal could be done in the middle of the season for the £100million-rated Sancho after his recent troubles at Borussia Dortmund.</p>

      <p>If United can pull this off, it would be a superb purchase for the club to finally strengthen what has long been a problem position for them.</p>
      <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer allowed Chilean flop Alexis Sanchez to join Inter Milan on loan in the summer, but could really have done with making a big signing to replace him at the time.</p>
      <p>Still, Sancho could definitely do that job if he joins in January, while Goal also report of Man Utd’s interest in the £85m-rated Red Bull Salzburg striker Haaland.</p>

      <p>The 19-year-old Norway international has been in sensational form in front of goal this season and seems ideal to come in as an <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/19/man-united-sancho-haaland-transfers-bad-news-for-rashford/">upgrade on the under-performing Marcus Rashford</a>.</p>
      <p>United could no doubt do with West Ham starlet Rice coming in in defensive midfield, but improving in attack is arguably more of a pressing concern.</p>
      <p>And while Mandzukic has shone at Juventus, MUFC fans would surely rather see Solskjaer strengthen with two top young talents like Sancho and Haaland, rather than go for a more short-term move for the veteran Croatia international.</p>
