      <h1>Meet the black women who are shattering football's glass ceiling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:05:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/sophie-penney/" target="_blank">Sophie Penney</a></address>
      <p>For the first time in the 11-year history of the Black List, which celebrates the contributions of black men and women to football, half of those chosen are women. Here are three who are changing the sport from the inside.</p>
      <h3>'I started playing out of defiance - the world was against me'  </h3>
      <p>
        <b>Iqra Ismail — the teenage trailblazer</b>
      </p>
      <p>When Iqra Ismail joined her first ever football club and the coach handed out the kit, she had to pull him to one side. As a 14-year-old the Somali Muslim girl, she could not, she explained, wear shorts. “Oh I’m sorry," came the coach's slightly panicked reply, "I’ve never had a Muslim player on my team before.”</p>
      <p>“Immediately I felt like this other, this outsider,” says Iqra, reflecting on the incident five years on. “My team-mates would say: ‘Iqra, aren’t you hot’ and I would have to stop and explain ‘It’s not about that; it’s a religious thing.’ Sometimes it would be: ‘Iqra, do you not have any water?’ and I would have to explain, ‘It’s Ramadan so I’m fasting.'"</p>
      <p>Cultural clumsiness is one thing, but Iqra has had more sinister battles to fight in her effort to play the game she loves. One club she was trying to join turned her down four years in a row, while a move to the United States to join a club that had accepted her was vetoed by her mother because of perceived anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of Donald Trump's election as president. </p>
      <p>“That was shattering for me at that age," she says. "Women’s football wasn’t quite there yet in this country at that point and America was the place to be to get to where you want to be in your career.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to Iqra at her old school, Featherstone High in West London, it is clear that a lack of understanding has shadowed Iqra throughout her time playing football.</p>
      <p>“Being a young black Muslim girl I’ve literally drawn all the short straws,” says Iqra. “I came to terms with that quite young and realised that the world really is against me.” </p>
      <p>And yet, she is not giving up — quite the opposite. Working on the basis that if a club was not willing to have her, she would simply start her own, she founded NUR, 'Never Underestimate Resilience', a football club for black and minority ethnic (BAME) women.  “It really was resilience that got me to this point,” she says. “If you let something beat you the world’s still going to keep turning. It’s up to you to pick yourself up and keep pushing for what you want because no one else is going to get it for you.</p>

      <p>“I started playing in primary school out of defiance. I think I was told that girls can’t play and I said: ‘Well, I’m going to play then.’”</p>
      <p>Her primary school team was a harsh education in the obstacles that can be placed in the path of girls with a passion for football. </p>
      <p>There was just one team, and only one girl picked for it. Iqra, the second best girl in her school, protested in her final year, and was finally allowed to play. In a crunch cup semi-final a few weeks later, she made a goal-line clearance which won the tie for her side. "That’s why you pick two girls,” she told teachers afterwards.</p>
      <p>Fed up of feeling like she did not belong in all the teams she joined, Iqra dreamt of one day creating a space where women like her would feel accepted. This became a reality much sooner than expected. “In April this year I was on holiday in Greece for my birthday. I’ve got this beautiful view outside the balcony and all I’m doing is I’m sitting there thinking, what am I going to do with this logo, where are we going to be based? That’s when I realised I need to start pushing for this.”</p>
      <p>So at just 19 years old she set up NUR Football Club. About 15 people turned up to the first session in late June; by week four, that number had almost trebled. “It was surreal. For people to be coming up to me and saying: ‘This is what I’ve been looking for’," she says. "I see myself in every single player, they’ve got that drive, that willingness, they’ve finally found that home.” </p>
      <p>She transferred from Portsmouth University to Middlesex part-way through her studies, just so that she could coach and play for NUR in their eight-a-side league in south-east London.</p>
      <p>Among the team and coaching staff there are only about four people who are younger than Iqra. “I felt a sudden wave of social responsibility, and everyone placed this armour on me,” she said. “I thought, right, I’ve got to be this knight that you’ve dressed me up to be. I’m actually quite little. But I’ve got to use that to my advantage. I’ve just got to knuckle down and make the most of those years.”</p>
      <p>For Iqra this is just the beginning. “We could branch out in terms of location. I’ve had a couple of people in Cardiff, Leicester, Birmingham, Liverpool reach out to me. I do want to start taking women younger than 16 too, maybe under-10s. It’s very important to instil this concept of resilience from quite a young age.”</p>
      <h3>'People judge me before they speak to me'</h3>

        <b>Lungi Macebo — the boardroom executive</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even now, when Lungi Macebo walks into an opposition boardroom, those inside often perform a double-take — a flick of the eyes which is always loaded with meaning. </p>
      <p>Macebo is the Chief Operating Officer of Birmingham City Football Club and a 29-year-old woman of colour.  At away games, she has regularly been met with looks of confusion and has been asked whether she intended to go to the director’s entrance. Once inside, it has more than once been assumed that she is a partner of one of the directors rather than an executive in her own right.</p>

      <p>“It’s hard because you know you’re different,” says Macebo, slightly bemused but with not a shred of self-pity. “It’s just another one of those things where they’ve judged me before they’ve even spoken to me. I think people genuinely don’t expect it.”</p>
      <p>Macebo has always been a football devotee, from her days as a young child growing up in South Africa, having inherited the bug from her father. “My dad’s not a difficult character but he’s very much an authoritarian figure and it was one thing that I had in common with him," she says. "Being able to have that level of football conversation with him has definitely transformed our relationship from when I was growing up.”</p>
      <p>She started working in football by rising through the HR ranks at Charlton before moving to Birmingham in February this year. St Andrew's is, in many ways, a fitting home: this is a club, after all, with a history of advancing trailblazing women, having made a 23-year-old Karren Brady managing director in 1993. Macebo, another rapidly rising star, could be destined for similar things.</p>
      <p>“I started in a temporary role as a receptionist at Charlton," Macebo says. "That was seven years ago in January, which is such a short period of time. It seems like a lifetime ago."</p>
      <p>Macebo counts herself lucky that she has never experienced overt racism or discrimination. Instead, she says the biggest barrier has been her own self-belief. When she talks about every big step up she has taken the same phrases come up: “Who am I to be doing that?”, “That’s not something that I’m ready for just now”, “That job is way too big for me”. And yet her inner ambition has always driven her to apply, and she got the roles. </p>
      <p>Macebo says she does not have a fire in her belly ignited by injustice but she does think improvements are needed for more people like her to reach the top.  </p>
      <p>“In terms of gender equality in the boardroom it is certainly changing," she says. "It's not not fast enough, but there are definitely changes. Then when you bring race into it it becomes harder. I definitely think football has a long way to go in terms of inclusion and diversity. I’d like to be part of that conversation but I don’t know if it’s something I can do.”</p>
      <p>I ask her whether she thinks she is leading by example, but she will only let a sliver of that inner confidence shine through. “I do think there’s some people’s presumptions that I’ve changed. I’d like to think so anyway.”</p>
      <h3>'If you can see it, you can be it'</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Vivienne Aiyela — the FA diversity guru</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vivienne Aiyela has always taken history in her stride. She was the first black female to become a non-executive director in the Football Association’s 138-year history and now, at the London FA, she is fighting to bring more BAME women into decision-making roles in football.</p>
      <p>“Because people see black guys playing football they automatically expect black women to be involved in football. You don’t see many women like me in football,” she says. “People don’t expect you to be involved at that high level — not as an ethnic minority, and especially a woman.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Aiyela was not even tempted by the role at the London FA originally. “Because of what I know of football with the racism and the reputation that it has, I said I wasn't interested.”</p>
      <p>Aiyela has always worked in improving diversity and inclusion, having moved from the Metropolitan Police into football. “Diversity and inclusion runs through my veins,” she says. “My family are very multicultural, my mum faced discrimination in her job and I used to be involved in the anti-apartheid movement, so it's in my DNA. My ethos is challenge the status quo to make a difference.” </p>
      <p>It was this drive for change that made her finally go for the job at the FA, and first in her sights was her own office. When she arrived, the London FA board had three black people including her and she says the council was 98 per cent "old white men". Now, there are eight men and eight women on the board, all recruited on merit. Seven are from ethnic minorities.</p>
      <p>“The London FA has to look like what it represents," she explains. "I did some positive action, going out and encouraging BAME women to apply and then they earnt it. There's a lot of women in London that are doing some groundbreaking work but you don't hear about it.”</p>
      <p>Aiyela says you can see the change, “When you go to the meeting you know that things will be discussed openly, and the atmosphere is very different because you’ve got different voices around the table. I think it’s uncomfortable for some but you’ve got to have those uncomfortable conversations for change to happen.”</p>
      <p>The World Cup flicked another switch in Vivienne’s mind. “I went to see the Chile vs US game in Paris. I took the first Eurostar out on a Sunday morning, its normally empty but it was jam packed. We got to Paris and the atmosphere was electric. I came back and I said to the chair: 'We need to do something in London.'”</p>
      <p>By that time they had just written a strategy for ensuring women have access to pitches, which are often booked out, and to find those playing under the radar to give them access to leagues and tournaments. She decided they needed a women and girls' advisory committee to help oversee the strategy — another opportunity to bring women into decision-making roles. </p>
      <p>It all tallies with one of Aiyela's key mantras: “If you can see it, you can be it.” For many, Aiyela is that role model but you sense that her work is only just beginning.</p>
