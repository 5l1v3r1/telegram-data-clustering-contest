        <b>Kanye West is staging his first opera</b>
      </p>
      <p>Following the release of his hip-hop/gospel album <i>Jesus is King</i>, noted renaissance man Kanye West has set his sights on a different art form: The opera. West has announced plans to stage an original opera, based on the life of the biblical king Nebuchadnezzar, at the Hollywood Bowl. Few details on the show have emerged — but personally, we're hoping that Taylor Swift rushes the stage at the climax to grab the microphone and declare that actually, Hezekiah was the best biblical king of all time.

        <b>Henry Cavill says he still plans to play Superman</b>
      </p>
      <p>The recent swap from Ben "Batfleck" Affleck to Robert "Battinson" Pattinson in the role of Batman seemed to herald the end of the original Justice League lineup, with Wonder Woman and Aquaman veering off into their own solo adventures. But while there's no new <i>Superman</i> movie on the horizon, star Henry Cavill says you shouldn't count him out yet. "The cape is in the closet. It's still mine," says Cavill — but in 2019, where will he find a phone booth so he can change into it?

        <b>Rupert Grint says he saw sparks between <i>Harry Potter</i> costars Emma Watson and Tom Felton</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ron Weasley may be Hermione Granger's true love in the <i>Harry Potter</i> movies, but in the real world, another candidate may have emerged: Draco Malfoy. In a recent interview, actor Rupert Grint conceded that there was always "a little bit of a spark" between Emma Watson, who played Hermione, and Tom Felton, who played Draco. Watson, who recently declared herself "self-partnered," has long been close with Felton, buoying fans' hopes about a possible romance between the two — but anyone who can't wait for the actors to get together can just read one of the 8,000 or so <i>Harry Potter</i> fanfics in which Hermione and Draco Malfoy fall in love. (Friendly advice: Stick to the G-rated ones.) [<a href="https://www.etonline.com/rupert-grint-says-he-always-saw-sparks-between-emma-watson-and-tom-felton-exclusive-136582"><i>ET Online</i></a>]</p>

        <b>Bong Joon-ho says he would never direct a Marvel movie because of the tight clothes</b>
      </p>
      <p>The breakout success of this year's <i>Parasite</i> probably means that director Bong Joon-ho can choose anything as his next project — but whatever it turns out to be, it doesn't sound like superheroes will be involved. When asked if he'd be interested in helming a Marvel movie, Bong said no for a bizarrely specific reason: He doesn't like tight clothes. "I'll never wear something like that, and just seeing someone in tight clothes is mentally difficult," says Bong. "I don't know where to look, and I feel suffocated. Most superheroes wear tight suits, so I can never direct one" — so unless you're pitching <i>JNCO Jeans Man</i>, best to look elsewhere.
