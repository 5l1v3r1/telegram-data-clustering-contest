      <p>Another day, another prowler caught on security camera.</p>
      <p>A Castanet reader sent in this photo captured on the weekend of an unwanted person approaching their home.</p>
      <p>The image was taken just before 7 p.m. of a male near Rose Avenue and Aberdeen Street, in the Kelowna General Hospital area.</p>
      <p>The person came to the reader's front door and found it locked, then proceeded to the deck to check the back door.</p>
      <p>The resident went outside to see if the prowler was still around, and ended up finding a drug baggy, a lighter and a piece of foil with burnt residue on it.</p>
