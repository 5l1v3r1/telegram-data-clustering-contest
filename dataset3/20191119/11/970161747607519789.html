        <b>Johnny Vegas has announced the sad news of his mother Patricia’s death this week with a heartfelt tribute describing her as ‘the best’.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 49-year-old comedian, real name Michael Pennington, shared the devastating news with his Twitter followers on Tuesday, confirming Patricia died ‘peacefully in her sleep’ on Sunday (17 November).</p>
      <p>Expressing his grief, Johnny also said he’s still trying to ‘process’ the loss.</p>
      <p>‘With a kind of deep regret that I’m still incapable of processing, I have to confirm that Ma Vegas, Patricia, passed away last Sunday, peacefully in her sleep,’ Johnny told his Twitter followers alongside a photo of Patricia smiling and holding her dog.</p>
      <p>‘To say she was a bit of a character would be too huge an underestimation. As a Mum I dare to argue I had the best x.’</p>
      <p>The Benidorm star also included a photo of a framed note which Patricia wrote to Johnny when he was younger.</p>

      <p>Rugby player Steve Prescott also said: ‘Our brother @JohnnyVegasReal our thoughts and prayers are with you all x Patricia will always be remembered and her name will always make us laugh smile for eternity! Take care pal, we are always here for you like you are for us xxx RIP.’</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Johnny revealed that Patricia had been discharged from St Helens Whiston after undergoing surgery for a mystery ailment.</p>
      <p>Johnny’s father, Laurence Pennington, died in 2018 after a cancer battle.</p>
      <p>The comedian later opened up about his loss during an appearance on Loose Women and said: ‘I haven’t dealt with it, I haven’t mourned him yet, I’ve got no idea of what mourning is. I haven’t had the cry yet. In fact, I’m angry at him for going as quickly as he did.</p>

      <p>‘I don’t accept his death. I’m angry I don’t think about him on a daily basis but I don’t want to accept he’s gone.</p>
      <p>‘I feel guilty that I don’t think about him on a daily basis. Things don’t go back to normal.’</p>
