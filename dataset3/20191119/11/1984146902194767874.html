      <p>The festive food offerings are coming thick and fast now and the latest place to unveil their seasonal treats are KFC.</p>
      <p>As well as it being the most wonderful time of the year for spending time with friends and family and present buying, it is also a great time if you love to tuck into some <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> scran and KFC have most definitely tickled our tastebuds with their new festive menu.</p>
      <p>The centre piece of the new menu is the Festive Burger, which contains one piece of original recipe chicken, a fried hash brown sage and onion stuffing mayonnaise, a tangy cranberry dressing and a layer of cheese.</p>
      <p>Not one to rest on their Yuletide laurels, KFC haven't stopped there. They have also pimped up their fries for the festive season. The fries differ from regular fries in that they are sprinkled with pepper, toasted onions, garlic and herbs.</p>
      <p>Both of the new items are available to tuck into as part of the Christmas box meal. Costing £6.89, you get the Festive Burger drink, fries, a side and a piece of original recipe chicken.</p>
      <p>And if you've still got room for dessert, there's a festive sweet treat from the Colonel to sample too, with the new Mint Chocolate Krushem costing £2.79.</p>
