      <p>Actor Angad Bedi has been trained by his father and former Indian cricketer Bishan Singh Bedi for his role in the upcoming web show <i>Inside Edge 2</i>.</p>
      <p>Angad plays ace cricketer Arvind Vashisth in the web series.</p>
      <p>The actor, who has been receiving such many cricket lessons from his father since childhood, said: “I remember my childhood was largely on the cricket field and there is no-one who knows every move of mine and every beat of my game process, like dad.</p>

      <p>“So no matter who comes on board to coach me, they won’t know me as well as my father.</p>
      <p>“We went back to our gruelling sessions starting as early as 4.30 a.m. after which I used to go back to the ground for practice sessions. After my training, we’d play a game stretching over a few overs. Dad has always been extremely supportive of my dream.”</p>
      <p>He added: “When at 17, I announced my decision to leave cricket, he was heartbroken but never let that pull me down from living my dreams.</p>
      <p>“Now when I went back to him for help, he was forthcoming as always. The taskmaster that he is, he ensured that I knew every tough shot like the back of my hand.</p>
      <p>“I have to say I have been able to surprise myself and attribute this performance to Dad. His work makes me look this good.”</p>
      <p>Written and directed by Karan Anshuman, the first season of <i>Inside Edge </i>revolved around the Mumbai Mavericks team — a part of PPL (Powerplay T20 League), which is a fictional Indian Premier League kind of T20 cricket tournament.</p>
      <p>The series also featured Sanjay Suri, Sayani Gupta and Siddhanth Chaturvedi. The second season will air on December 6.</p>
