        <b>Victor Camarasa is reportedly set to cut short his temporary spell at Crystal Palace to join Norwich on loan in January.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The central midfielder joined the Eagles on a season-long loan deal from Real Betis over the summer but has featured for just five minutes in the Premier League this season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/crystal-palace"><b>Palace</b></a> paid €1.5m for the temporary deal and would be obliged to pay €13.5m to make the deal a permanent one – should Camarasa play 15 or more games this campaign – as outlined by <i>Mucho Deporte</i>.</p>
      <p>The former Levante star joined Betis in a €7m deal in 2017 but made only 14 starts in his sole LaLiga campaign in Seville.</p>
      <p>Camarasa had impressed at Cardiff on a season-long loan deal last term, with five goals in 32 league games, including strikes against Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal.</p>
      <p>However, the Bluebirds suffered relegation and were not able to retain the player, while Tottenham had also been linked with a move for the Spaniard earlier this summer.</p>
      <p>However, it would now appear that struggling <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/norwich-city"><b>Norwich</b></a> are ready to snap up Camarasa as they look to move away from the foot of the table.</p>
