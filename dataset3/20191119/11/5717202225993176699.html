      <p>Leicester City are in the hunt for promising Fiorentina wideman Riccardo Sottil, <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/17-63465746/attenta_fiorentina_il_leicester_ha_messo_nel_mirino_sottil/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">according to Italian outlet Corriere Dello Sport.</a></p>
      <p>They <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/17-63465746/attenta_fiorentina_il_leicester_ha_messo_nel_mirino_sottil/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">report</a> that the Foxes had representatives watching the 20-year-old during the Italian Under 21 international against Iceland.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old opened the scoring in front of the Leicester scouts, before Wolves hitman Patrick Cutrone rounded off the 3-0 victory with two late goals.</p>
      <p>Leicester are <a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2019/11/17-63465746/attenta_fiorentina_il_leicester_ha_messo_nel_mirino_sottil/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">reportedly</a> eyeing a January swoop for the young winger and are likely to have come away from their scouting mission impressed by what they saw.</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Another young wideman would ramp up pressure on Demarai Gray</h3>
      <p>Leicester have made strides to strengthen their wide options in the past year, bringing Ayoze Perez last summer as well as recalled Harvey Barnes early from his loan at West Brom to compete for a first team place.</p>
      <p>James Maddison can play wide on occasion, and Marc Albrighton is still knocking around and that all ramps up the pressure on Demarai Gray.</p>
      <p>He remains a hugely talented option with plenty of room for growth but yet another improvement in a wide area would likely shunt him further down the pecking order and may leave him questioning whether he can clamber back to the top at the King Power Stadium.</p>
