      <p>From Bon Appétit's April 2018 issue, a recipe from Chris Morocco.</p>
      <p>"Magic happens when toasted garlic oil meets fragrant za'atar. But if you don't have za'atar on hand, dried mint is equally delicious infused into hot oil."</p>
      <h3>Smashed Cucumber Salad with Za'atar and Feta</h3>
      <p>Recipe by Chris Morocco<br/>Makes 4 servings</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>5 mini seedless or Persian cucumbers or 1 small English hothouse cucumber (about 12 oz.)<br/>Kosher salt<br/>2 garlic cloves, lightly smashed<br/>4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil<br/>2 Tbsp. za'atar or 1 Tbsp. dried mint and 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds<br/>½ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes<br/>2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice<br/>Crumbled feta (for serving)</p>
      <p>
        <i>Preparation:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Gently smash cucumbers with a rolling pin or the back of a heavy knife just to break open. Tear into irregular 2" pieces and place in a medium bowl; season lightly with salt. Let sit at least 5 minutes and up to 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook garlic and oil in a small saucepan or skillet over medium-low heat, turning garlic once, until golden brown and very fragrant, 5-7 minutes. Add za'atar and red pepper flakes and remove from heat. Let cool until just warm and stir in lime juice; season dressing with salt. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Drain cucumbers, discarding any liquid they have released. Add to bowl with dressing and toss several times to coat. Top with feta.</li>
      </ul>
