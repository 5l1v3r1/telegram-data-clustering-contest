      <p>The father of a schoolboy told to ‘pull his socks up’ by teachers who thought he was faking illness has urged parents to listen to their kids after the youngster was diagnosed with a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>Charlie Card, 11, would spend hours retching into an empty bowl and regularly missed school after constantly complaining he didn’t feel well.</p>
      <p>His school became suspicious and even his loved ones thought his behaviour was strange, initially putting the blame for his stiff neck and tiredness on too much time playing Xbox.</p>
      <p>But parents Rosie and Gary, who lost a six-month-old baby following an infection in 2009, kept bringing their son back to the doctors.</p>
      <p>They initially dismissed the complaints, recommending he see a child psychologist, while one suggested he was telling fibs.</p>
      <p>But in Easter this year Charlie was told he had been living with a brain tumour for six months.</p>

      <p>Gary, 43, said his boy is now a shell of his former self and has pleaded for parents to never ignore their children.</p>

      <p>‘Listen to the kids if they tell you they are not right,’ he stressed.</p>
      <p>‘I say to this day that it was Charlie who got himself diagnosed because he wouldn’t take no for an answer.</p>
      <p>‘This is a common theme in hospitals.</p>
      <p>‘We were told that a GP will never diagnose a brain tumour and if they do it will be once in their whole career.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t blame the doctors because it is just so common for brain tumours to be dismissed.’</p>
      <p>Charlie began missing school earlier this year and after a while, Gary said, his teachers began to think he was ‘putting it on’.</p>
      <p>On Easter Monday he complained of having visual disturbances and was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital in Newcastle near their home.</p>

      <p>A CAT scan later revealed pressure on the nerves of his eyes before a doctor informed the family of the tumour – known as malignant medulloblastoma.</p>
      <p>‘He told Charlie he was a surgeon and needed to go into the back of his head and take the tumour out to make him better,’ Gary said.</p>

      <p>‘He was absolutely petrified and it was probably the only time he ever cried and he was saying “I want to go home – I promise I will come back”.’</p>
      <p>Charlie underwent a five-and-a-half hour operation the following day where 99 per cent of the tumour was successfully removed.</p>
      <p>He has since endured rounds of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with his final session due on Friday.</p>
      <p>But Charlie, who has dreams of being a professional footballer, is now a different boy after the gruelling treatment.</p>

      <p>‘Before he was so open, funny, had a wicked sense of humour but now he is a shell of his former self,’ Gary said.</p>
      <p>‘He won’t open up, he has lost so much weight, 90 per cent of his hair is gone including his eyebrows and his lips are dry and cracked.</p>
      <p>‘He is in constant pain.’</p>
      <p>Gary is now planning to give his son the best Christmas ever after his year of hell.</p>
      <p>He has <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/charlie039s-christmas-wish?utm-medium=referral&amp;utm-source=unknown&amp;utm-campaign=comms-rg8w+charlie039s-christmas-wish">set up a fundraising page</a> to share Charlie’s story and has been overwhelmed by the response.</p>
      <p>Charlie’s dream is to receive a signed pair of boots from his favourite footballer – Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>His dad has no idea if he will be able to achieve his son’s number one request but he has now raised over £1,000 to ensure Charlie gets some special gifts.</p>
      <p>‘Ideally he wants the Ronaldo signed boots but if he was offered them or the chance to take away his treatment and never have another hospital appointment in his life he would take the latter,’ Gary said.</p>
      <p>‘He is terrified because this is the same hospital his brother Hayden passed away in and Charlie knows all about him.</p>
      <p>‘Even though he was only 14 months old when he died he has always said he lives his life twice for him.’</p>

      <p>Sarah Lindsell, CEO for The Brain Tumour Charity, said: ‘We can only improve the quality of life for everyone affected by a brain tumour diagnosis by increasing awareness of the symptoms. This is the key to our HeadSmart campaign.</p>
      <p>‘HeadSmart has two aims: to save lives and reduce long-term disability by bringing down childhood brain tumour diagnosis times.</p>
      <p>‘The campaign helps us to achieve that goal by alerting more healthcare professionals, parents and young people to the signs and symptoms of the disease.</p>
      <p>‘As the UK’s foremost brain tumour charity, we are leading the way in fighting brain tumours on all fronts through our work.</p>
      <p>‘Together, we will find a cure.’</p>
