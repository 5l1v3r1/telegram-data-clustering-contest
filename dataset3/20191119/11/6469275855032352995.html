        <b>Staff and members of a Preston gym have cycled their way to fund-raising success in aid of Lostock Hall &amp; Bamber Bridge Guide Dog Group.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Active Nation Gym Preston marked Guide Dog month in October with both a sponsored spin and dog walk to raise money for the charity.</p>
      <p>They collected more than Â£240 as well as raising awareness of the life-changing effect of the pups for people living with blindness.</p>
      <p>Linda Ward, chairperson of the charity branch, said: "The fund-raising was always done with a great deal of fun from everyone and generated a real community spirit and we couldn't have asked for more."</p>
