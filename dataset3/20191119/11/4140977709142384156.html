                <p>Earlier in September Oman won the reverse fixture with a 1 – 2 score line. A 24th minute strike by Chetri in the Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium had put India in the driver’s seat until they conceded two goals in the dying moments of the game. Al Mandhar Al Alawi scored twice for the Gulf Samba’s. </p>
                <p>With three draws and one defeat, India stands fourth in the Round 2 Group E table; whereas Oman holds the second position with nine points from four games. Igor Stimac and his men have faced a lot of criticism for their performance in the Qualification rounds. India would need a talismanic performance for their strikers, as ability to score goals has been an area of concern. </p>
