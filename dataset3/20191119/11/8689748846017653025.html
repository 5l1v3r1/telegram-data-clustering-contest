      <p><a href="http://www.ghbase.com/forget-rap-music-the-genre-is-devilish-kanye-west/">Kanye West</a> has become the talk of the world since he made music enthusiasts especially his fans privy to his willingness to churn out a gospel album christened “Jesus Is King”.</p>
      <p>Although critical thinkers are convinced beyond doubt that Kanye’s gospel album is a strategy to rekindle or better still resurrect his relevancy in the show business and that Christians shouldn’t think they’ve gotten a new convert.</p>

      <p>Back to the subject matter, Kanye West who has been leading a weekly musical Christian Sunday Service for a year, made a special appearance at Pastor Joel Osteen’s service at his Lakewood mega church in Houston on Sunday, November 17, 2019. There he gave a spiritual speech, partially about himself;</p>
      <p>“Now, the greatest artist that God has ever exist- uh, created is now working for Him. I know that God has been calling me for a long time and the Devil has been distracting me for a long time,” he said, drawing applause. And when I was at my lowest point, God was there with me, and sending me visions and inspiring me,” the hip-hop star said.</p>
      <p>During his speech at Osteen’s church, Kanye, who has in recent years become a devout Christian talked about being silenced when it comes to talking about Jesus publicly, especially in California, one of the most liberal and secular states.</p>
