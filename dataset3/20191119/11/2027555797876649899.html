      <p>As criticism mounted over the new uniform of Rajya Sabha marshals resembling military uniform, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said the Secretariat will revisit the issue to address concerns. </p>
      <p>In the Upper House, Naidu said he has received objections about the new dress code from political leaders and some "well-meaning" people. "I have decided to ask the Rajya Sabha Secretariat to revisit the same and take it forward, " he said. </p>

      </p>
      <p>On Monday, MPs were in for a surprise when they saw the marshals in new uniform, which resembles military uniform. </p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha sources said the marshals had suggested the break from tradition by moving away from "old turban clad dress" to one with a "modern look".  Subsequently, they said, senior officers of the Secretariat including the security officers held several rounds of discussions before designing the new dress. </p>
      <p>About a half a dozen marshals assist the Chair in conducting the proceedings of the House. However, former senior military officials raised concern about the uniform resembling the military attire. </p>
