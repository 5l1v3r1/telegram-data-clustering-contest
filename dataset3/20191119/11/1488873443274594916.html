      <h1>Barcelona-based Broomx raises €2 million to keep expanding with its virtual reality projector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:30:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.eu-startups.com/author/thomas-ohr/" target="_blank">Thomas Ohr</a></address>
      <p>The immersive technology startup <a href="http://www.broomx.com/">Broomx Technologies</a> has just closed a funding round of €2 million. Telefónica’s Open Innovation Hub Wayra, BStartup of Banc Sabadell and Stornoway Investments are investing together with a group of business angels from the UK and Luxembourg. The fresh capital will be used to accelerate Broomx’s expansion in Europe and the United States.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2014, the startup recently finished a six-month incubation programme with Abbey Road Studios’ music tech incubator Abbey Road Red, resulting in a partnership with Universal Music Group.</p>
      <p>Broomx is the creator of the world’s first virtual reality projector, the MK360, a technology that allows people to enjoy immersive shared experiences in real spaces without using virtual reality headsets. This technology is already being used in 20 different countries, and among its clients are big names such as the Catalonia Hotels and Marriot hotel groups, corporations such as Skoda, Asepeyo and Japanese NTT Docomo, and universities such as UCLA in the United States. In addition, the company is participating in a clinical study on the impact of immersive technologies in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases funded by the Ministry of Health of Canada.</p>
