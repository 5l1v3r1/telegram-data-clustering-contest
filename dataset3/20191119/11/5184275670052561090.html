      <p>Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man has fetched immense popularity across the globe and the character, in general, has its set of loyal fans. Apart from the emotional connect the fans share with the character, its suit is something which is most-talked about. Taking inspiration from the suit, a guy named Shyam Chaurasia from Varanasi has developed a prototype for helping the Indian army.</p>
      <p>Shyam work as a part-time employee in the Ashoka Institute Of Technology and Management. He says, “It is a metal suit designed to help the Indian Army soldiers during their encounters with terrorists and enemies. Currently, it is just a prototype, but it can help the soldiers immensely during the times of the battle. We have used gears and motors and it also has a mobile connection so that it can be used remotely. It has sensors that will help the jawans even when he is attacked from the back.”</p>

      <p>Shyam’s model of the suit is quite progressive with the inclusion of sensors and assures of reducing the risk for the soldiers. The suit is made up of tin and the passionate guy is seeking for funds to complete the full-proof product.</p>
      <p>He adds, “I would urge the government agencies like DRDO to take note of this suit and to build upon it to help the soldiers as other countries like Pakistan among others too are working on such models. The cost of a soldier’s life is very high, what I have done is just an attempt to bring it in the radar of DRDO and other agencies,” reports ANI.</p>
