      <p>A Burnaby driver slammed into a parked SUV and didn't even stop to check the damage.</p>
      <p>The hit and run was caught on security camera from across the street in the Duthie/Curtis area on Sunday, about 11:20 a.m.</p>
      <p>The older compact car slams into the front of the SUV, and the driver keeps going without a moment's hesitation.</p>
      <p>The owner of the crunched SUV shared the video with Glacier Media in hopes someone might recognize the offending vehicle.</p>
      <p>The neighbour who captured the video ran outside to get a licence number, but the white male driving was already speeding off.</p>
