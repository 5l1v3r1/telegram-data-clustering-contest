        <i>The Liverpool and Netherlands midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum has spoken strongly on the state of racism in football after a Dutch second division match was halted. The game between FC Den Bosch and Excelsior was stopped, after alleged abuse was directed at Excelsior winger Ahmad Mendes Moreira. 'It's a problem in society and a problem that should be solved by our politicians,' Wijnaldum said. 'I also saw someone doing the Nazi salute in the stands. When I saw that, I thought 'what is wrong with you if you do something like that?'. Our ancestors fought for us so we can live freely.'</i>
