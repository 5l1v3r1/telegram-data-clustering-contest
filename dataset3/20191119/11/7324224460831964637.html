      <p>Unions are seeking urgent assurances about the future of steel plants in the UK after Tata Steel announced plans to axe thousands of jobs.</p>
      <p>The company, which employs around 750 staff at Wednesfield Steel Park in Wolverhampton, said it wanted to come to terms with a “severe” international steel market, with up to 3,000 jobs at risk across its European operations.</p>
      <p>Tata added that there would be no plant closures, but unions have voiced concern about the impact in the UK.</p>

      <p>Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the Community union, said: “This is a shocking announcement, which will worry many steelworkers and their families in the UK and across Europe.</p>
      <p>“This news has been badly handled and the company should hang its head in shame with the way this development has been communicated.</p>
      <p>“The workforce should not pay the price for the failure of the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp nor the lack of a plan B when the joint venture talks collapsed.</p>
      <p>“We secured a jobs guarantee until 2021 and we will be robustly defending that agreement.</p>
      <p>“We want a long-term vision for the future of steelmaking in Tata Steel Europe, not the management of decline by 3,000 job cuts.</p>
      <p>“While company management are responsible for the direction they are taking, yet again we must call for more action to create a level playing field for UK steel businesses.</p>
      <p>“Our steel producers continue to face higher energy costs, high business rates and competition from cheap imports.</p>
      <p>“Government attempts to address these longstanding issues have not created the environment our steel companies need to compete effectively in a global market.”</p>
      <aside>We understand the global challenges affecting the steel industry but any loss of jobs could be a threat not only to the families affected, but also to the wider community. This uncertainty and constant threat of job losses drains confidence from the whole workforce<cite>Mike Payne, GMB</cite></aside>
      <p>Mike Payne, the GMB’s senior organiser for Wales and the South West, said: “We are demanding reassurances from Tata that these Europe-wide cuts won’t affect our members in Port Talbot.</p>
      <p>“We understand the global challenges affecting the steel industry but any loss of jobs could be a threat not only to the families affected, but also to the wider community.</p>
      <p>“This uncertainty and constant threat of job losses drains confidence from the whole workforce.”</p>
      <p>Henrik Adam, chief executive of Tata Steel in Europe, said: “We are highlighting important proposals towards building a financially strong and sustainable European business.</p>
      <p>“We plan to change how we work together to enable better co-operation and faster decision-making.</p>
      <p>“This will help us become self-sustaining and cash-positive in the face of unprecedented severe market conditions, enabling us to lead the way towards a carbon-neutral future.”</p>
      <p>Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: “This is terrible news for Tata Steel workers, made all the worse coming just before Christmas.</p>
      <p>“This Conservative Government has failed to support our manufacturing industry and people are paying for that failure with their livelihoods.”</p>
