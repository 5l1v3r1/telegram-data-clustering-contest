      <p>LUIS ENRIQUE HAS been reinstated as Spain national team manager.</p>
      <p>Spain swatted aside Romania 5-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano on Monday to confirm their participation at Euro 2020, but eyebrows were raised when head coach Roberto Moreno cancelled his post-match press conference following the match.</p>
      <p>The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) called a snap press conference for this morning, and it was speculated that Enrique was ready to return to the hot seat after officially stepping down in June due to personal issues.</p>
      <p>RFEF president Luis Rubiales and sporting director Jose Francisco Molina spoke to journalists to confirm the news at the media briefing. </p>
      <p>Enrique didn’t initially reveal his reasons for vacating the job, but it became apparent in August when <a href="https://www.the42.ie/luis-enrique-daughter-xana-4788341-Aug2019/">his nine-year-old daughter Xana tragically died of bone cancer in August</a>.</p>
      <p>Moreno, who was Enrique’s No 2, has guided Spain to a nine-match unbeaten run since his first match in a charge – a 2-0 win against Malta in March.</p>

      <p>Despite struggling in October in away draws against Norway and Sweden, La Roja clicked in this international break with the 7-0 belting of Malta last Thursday prior to the Romania thrashing Following a 4-0 victory against the Faroe Islands in September, Moreno admitted the team was still connected to their former boss and dedicated the result to him.</p>
      <blockquote>It upsets me to talk about it, but this team is his [Luis Enrique's] more than anyone’s,” Moreno said post-match. “It is a tiny thing, but we wanted to dedicate it, especially here in El Molinon.”</blockquote>
      <p>Enrique was appointed Spain boss in July 2018 following a tumultuous World Cup in Russia that saw Julen Lopetegui sacked in the lead-up the tournament with Fernando Hierro taking over in the interim.</p>
      <p>He previously managed Barcelona between 2014-17, winning the Champions League, two league titles and three Copas del Rey.</p>

      <p>Enrique decided not to renew his contract when it expired in June 2017, before having a 13-month sabbatical prior to be appointed Spain boss.</p>
