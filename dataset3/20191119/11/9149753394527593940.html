      <h1>How long is Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T11:03:46+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 11:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/harry-shepherd/" target="_blank">Harry Shepherd</a></address>
      <p>How long is Jedi: Fallen Order? If part of your decision when it comes to buying a game depends on the length of a game's campaign, this is no doubt a question you'll have in mind when it comes to one of the more promising single-player <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-star-wars-games-on-pc/">Star Wars games</a> to emerge in recent years: Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</p>
      <p>If you're a Star Wars fan, however, this is a canon entry to the interstellar series that mustn't be missed. It sees Jedi Cal Kestis, scarred by Order 66's massacre of his people, attempting to deal with his trauma in what appears to be one of the darker stories we've seen in the epic saga so far. But we're interested in Jedi: Fallen Order's length, so here's everything we know about that.</p>
      <h3>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order length</h3>
      <p>Our review of the game will be live on the site soon, but according to Tom, our reviewer, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is <b>17 hours long</b>, or perhaps a little less if you're really making a beeline for the end. That said, there's still plenty left for him to discover on the hunt to 100%.</p>
      <p>Tom says: "I completed it in 17 hours with minimal amounts of side exploration. If you want to hunt down every secret and customisation reward it's likely to take 25 hours or so."</p>
      <p>If you're struggling with finding them all, such as finding all the different <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-lightsaber-parts-customization/">Jedi: Fallen Order lightsaber parts</a>, expect to find some guides emerge on PC Gamer to help you out in due course.</p>
      <p>While Fallen Order is by no means an 100-hour epic, it looks like you'll be drinking in more of this outstanding fantasy universe for plenty longer than in the bare-bones Battlefront 2 campaign. The Metroidvania stylings of Fallen Order will certainly keep you digging for a good long time, but keep an eye out for our full review soon to see if those hours will actually be any good.</p>
