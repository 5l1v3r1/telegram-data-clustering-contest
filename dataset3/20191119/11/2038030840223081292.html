      <p>Cape Town – Selena Gomez and Bella Hadid had fans on Instagram in a frenzy over a mysteriously deleted post.</p>
      <p>In case you missed it, Selena and Bella haven't always been friends – Instagram or otherwise – after <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/watch-selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-are-instagram-official-20170130"><b>Selena was spotted with The Weeknd</b></a> who had been dating Bella. The model unfollowed the <i>Lose You To Love Me</i> singer before Selena did the same. But for a while it seemed like the two had put that behind them – Selena refollowed Bella and <a href="https://www.channel24.co.za/Gossip/News/bella-hadid-and-theweekndhave-broken-up-again-20190807"><b>Bella also started dating The Weeknd again</b></a> – but after a back and forth on Tuesday, fans think the two may have reignited their feud.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094653/selena-gomez-defends-wonderful-person-bella-hadid-over-deleted-instagram-post"><b>E! News</b></a>, Selena commented "stunning" on Bella's post, but then the image disappeared. Selena noticed fans picked up on the model's move writing, "She's all about supporting women. You all just can't take it nicely."</p>
      <p>"That sucks," Selena wrote with a crying face emoji.</p>
      <p>Having a fan base as big as Selena's would undoubtedly have troops rallying behind the <i>Look At Her Now</i> hitmaker. So Selena quickly cleared things up. "I shouldn't of [sic] spoken without knowing the truth. I'm sorry. Please don't be hurtful."</p>
      <p>She told Selenators, "She is a wonderful person and it was all a misunderstanding." </p>
