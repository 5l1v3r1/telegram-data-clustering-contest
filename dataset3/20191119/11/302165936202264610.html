      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 19 — Batu Kawan Bhd’s net profit for the financial year ended September 30, 2019 fell to RM363.49 million from RM365.68 million a year ago.</p>
      <p>Revenue declined 15.3 per cent to RM16.05 billion from RM18.95 billion previously, due to weaker performance from the plantation, manufacturing and industrial chemical division, it said in a filing with Bursa Malaysia today.</p>
      <p>The group said the plantation segment posted a 19.3 per cent lower revenue of RM6.39 million impacted by weaker crude palm oil (CPO) and palm kernel (PK) prices, while manufacturing reported a 13.2 per cent lower revenue of RM9.19 million.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the industrial chemical division posted a 27.6 per cent lower profit of RM101.70 million from lower selling prices and higher energy costs, it said.</p>
      <p> On prospects, the group expects its plantation profit to improve for financial year 2020 with CPO and PK prices recovering from their low levels.</p>
      <p>“The performance of the group’s oleochemical division should be sustained with some additional capacities coming on stream, while the industrial chemical segment, profits from both chlor-alkali and sulphuric acid businesses are projected to be satisfactory.</p>
      <p>“Overall, the group expects a higher profit for financial year 2020,” it said. — Bernama</p>
