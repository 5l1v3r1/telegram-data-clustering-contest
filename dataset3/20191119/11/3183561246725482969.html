      <p>After Marvel announced <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/freeform-has-cancelled-cloak-dagger">the end of Freeform series </a><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/freeform-has-cancelled-cloak-dagger"><i>Cloak &amp; Dagger</i></a><i>,</i> it felt like only a matter of time before another of its shows about magical teens—<a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/a-new-runaways-season-3-clip-teases-big-changes-for-gert-and-old-lace">Hulu’s </a><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/a-new-runaways-season-3-clip-teases-big-changes-for-gert-and-old-lace"><i>Runaways</i></a><i>—</i>suffered the same fate. Today, the hammer came down, but at least the news was accompanied by a fantastic trailer for the show’s third and final season.</p>
      <p>That <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/the-mcus-runaways-and-cloak-dagger-will-team-up-in-a-season-3-crossover-episode">much-anticipated crossover with<i> Cloak &amp; Dagger</i></a> is front and centre in the new trailer, as well as new glimpses of the season’s big bad, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/how-elizabeth-hurleys-magical-arrival-steps-up-runaways-game">Morgan le Fay</a>, played with what looks to be great relish by Elizabeth Hurley.</p>

      <p>But <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/marvels-runaways-to-end-season-3-hulu-canceled-final-season-trailer-1202788430/">as Deadline reports</a>, <i>Runaways</i> will indeed be ending after its upcoming third season, though the trade does note that “the story is said to come to a natural ending point,” so at least there’ll be no weird, unsatisfying cliffhangers to deal with.</p>
      <p>The cancellation comes as Marvel is putting most of its TV energy into its upcoming Disney+ series <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/you-cant-watch-any-of-the-new-marvel-shows-today-but-heres-some-concept-art">focusing on characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, though Hulu isn’t totally tapped out yet; as Deadline reminds us, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/10/hulu-and-marvels-helstrom-show-just-found-its-devilishly-good-cast">the live-action <i>Helstrom</i> is still on the way</a>, plus <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/02/howard-the-duck-modok-hit-monkey-and-dazzler-and-tigra-are-getting-their-own-seriesyes-you-read-that-right">the interconnected animated series</a> <i>Marvel’s M.O.D.O.K, Marvel’s Hit-Monkey, Marvel’s Tigra &amp; Dazzler Show,</i> and <i>Marvel’s Howard the Duck.</i></p>
      <p>As for <i>Runaways</i>, the final <i>s</i>eason premieres December 13 on Hulu.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Editor's note: The first two seasons of Marvel's Runaways are available on Foxtel Now. It's unclear whether they'll soon be available on Disney+ in the future.</i>
