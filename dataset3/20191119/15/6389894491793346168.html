      </p>
      <p>It consists of 1,100 battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles that produce zero carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>The app said choosing the electric fleet will not be any more expensive than its conventional option.</p>
      <p>Kapten’s London general manager Mariusz Zabrocki said the company wanted to do its bit in reducing air pollution in the capital.</p>
      <p><b>“</b>Londoners expect ride-hailing companies to address the air quality issue right where they live and not just sugar-coat their actions with carbon offsetting that doesn’t tackle the problem.</p>
      <p>“We’ve responded to this by introducing the electric class.” </p>
      <p>Kapten launched in London in May in a bid to challenge Uber’s supremacy over the industry.</p>
      <p>It has quickly jumped to the second-most used ride-hailing app in the capital on the back of a flurry of advertising and an offer of cheaper pricing.</p>
      <p>Kapten chief executive Sebastien Oebel told <i>City A.M. </i>last month that the company wanted to promote itself as caring about social justice and the environment.</p>
      <p>“We want to be a valuable partner to society and we believe our customers want to get the opportunity to support a company that believes in this,” Oebel said.</p>
      <p>“The generation that is in their late teens, and early twenties, are in particular much more concerned about this factor than generations before.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Kapten was awarded a long-term licence by Transport for London (TfL) to operate in the capital, unlike its main competitor Uber.</p>
      <p>The Silicon Valley tech giant’s licence runs out next week, after it was granted just a two-month extension due to concerns about customer safety.</p>
