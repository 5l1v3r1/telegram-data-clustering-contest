      <h1>McDonald's chips will be free this Friday for one day only - how to get yours</h1>
      <h2>This Friday McDonald’s UK will be giving away a free portion of Medium Fries through the My McDonald’s App - and absolutely everyone can get it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:02:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:02</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>When I was younger I heard a rumour that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> buy every single potato from their chosen variety, and that's why nobody else can make chips that taste as good.</p>
      <p>But while that may be an urban myth, the latest fries-related news regarding the fast food chain isn't, as McDonald's has just announced that this Friday, it will be giving away free fries.</p>
      <p>In a one-off generous giveaway, McDonald's has decided that on Friday 22 November, medium portions of the brand's famous chips will be completely free via the McDonald's app.</p>
      <p>Each customer can claim one pack each, with no purchase necessary, but rather than heading up to the counter or self-serve screens like normal, to get the freebie, you'll need to make sure you place your order via the McDonald's app.</p>
      <p>The offer is available to all new and existing McDonald's app customers, in selected branches. We've got the full list of all the 26 branches that aren't participating below.</p>
      <p>
        <b>PLEASE NOTE: The McDonald's website previously included an incorrect list of restaurants that won't be offering the free fries on Friday. There's actually only 26 branches that won't be included in the giveaway. Please see the full correct list below.</b>

      <p>As usual, to complete registration, new users must go into the restaurant for their first order – otherwise this offer works for click and collect, through the Drive Thru and from this week, for orders placed and delivered directly to your table thanks to the nationwide introduction of Table Markers.</p>
      <p>Table Markers, as the name suggests, means that customers can find a table, order through their phone and have their food delivered straight to where they’re sat.</p>
      <p>Sadly, the promotion is not available at the following 26 restaurants:</p>
      <p>1.       Croydon</p>
      <p>2.       Walworth Rd</p>
