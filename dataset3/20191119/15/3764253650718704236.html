      <p>According to Tribuna.com, the group is filled with football stars and coaches, and they were the ones who installed Messi as the new world's best.</p>
      <p>The publication further revealed that journalists leaned towards Van Dijk, who was second in the general vote.</p>
      <p>Despite playing alongside Hazard at Chelsea for well over five years, Mikel admits that the Belgian is good but has not reached the level of Messi.</p>
      <p>He said: ”<i>Hazard has incredible talent. Maybe he's not as good as Messi but he does what he wants with the ball on his feet</i>."</p>
