      <p>A generous Plymouth woman is looking to give away her wedding dress to someone in need.</p>
      <p>The lady, who does not wish to be named, got married a few years ago in a Â£1,300 Mori Lee designer dress.</p>
      <p>And now, she feels the time is right to give the dress to someone who would benefit from the stunning gown.</p>
      <p>"I got married back in 2016, and I know for most people, especially for the first couple of years, keeping your wedding dress is a very sentimental thing," she told Plymouth Live.</p>

      <p>"But now, myself and my husband are looking to go abroad for a few months, and I just thought to myself, actually I could really put this dress to good use.</p>
      <p>"It's always been important to me that people share good fortune, so I just feel like giving it to someone in need is the right thing to do.</p>
      <p>"Originally, I looked into giving the gown to charities that make gowns for still borns, but that seems to be a really popular route as they're inundated with donations at the moment.</p>

      <p>"So now I'm seeking to find another couple that would really benefit from this dress. Perhaps they've had a tough year, or they're experiencing illness and want to marry while they still can.</p>
      <p>"It would be great to be able to see the dress make a difference to someone else."</p>
      <p>The dress is around a UK Size 10, but could be adjusted accordingly.</p>
      <p>There are also a pair of shoes in size 7 which could go with the dress should they be required.</p>
      <p>
