      <p>A mother is to stand trial for allegedly subjecting her children to a campaign of cruelty.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old woman, who cannot be identified, appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court accused of offences against three girls and a boy.</p>
      <p>At least two of the alleged victims are her own children.</p>
      <p>She faces four counts of cruelty to a person under the age of 16 on dates between December 2013 and October 2017.</p>
      <p>According to the charges the woman wilfully assaulted, ill-treated and neglected them in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health.</p>
      <p>No further details were disclosed during a preliminary enquiry hearing where the accused confirmed that she understood the alleged offences.</p>
      <p>She declined to call witnesses or give any evidence at this stage in proceedings.</p>
      <p>A defence solicitor did not contest prosecution submissions that his client has a case to answer.</p>
      <p>On that basis District Judge Fiona Bagnall granted an application to have the woman returned for Crown Court trial.</p>
      <p>She was released on continuing bail until her expected arraignment on a date to be fixed.</p>
