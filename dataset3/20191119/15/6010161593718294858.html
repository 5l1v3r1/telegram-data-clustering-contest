      <p>This new Darksiders Genesis trailer shows off the game’s Creature Core system, which allows you to upgrade and customize your horseman’s abilities.</p>
      <p>In the new gameplay trailer, developer Airship Syndicate shows off the system for <b>Darksiders Genesis</b>. You will start off with a variety of different attacks that can be upgraded through gameplay.</p>
      <p>Creature Cores can be picked up after slaying enemies and bosses and can then be purchased at Vulgrim’s store in exchange for souls. This allows you to “shift the balance” between the horsemen Strife and War.</p>
      <p>Different abilities include the optionsto increase attack power, add a lava trail to dashes, spawn a hellhound, or even increase the amount of health and ammunition enemies will drop.</p>
