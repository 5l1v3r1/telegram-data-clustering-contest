      <p>Apple Park, the company’s new headquarters in Cupertino, CA, was completed last year. With a circular, futuristic design that’s instantly recognisable, it’s often called the “spaceship.” The public rarely gets to see inside the building, though, and visitors are only allowed in a certain areas.</p>
      <p>But an August video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChtB50MUCUHjh0c1vcmtw0g">YouTuber Yongsung Kim</a>, recently spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/davemark/status/1196795510713131008">The Loop executive editor Dave Mark</a>, gives the rest of us a chance to see inside Apple’s famed headquarters.</p>

      <p>The headquarters was completed in 2018 and cost Apple <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-park-spaceship-campus-2-finished-results-photos-2018-1">$US5 billion</a>. There’s a visitors centre and store for tourists looking to check out the campus where can buy official Apple apparel and merchandise only available to purchase there.</p>
      <p>Steve Jobs Theatre, a circular building next to the “spaceship” portion of the campus, offers 360-degree views thanks to its circular, all-glass walls. Once inside, a marble staircase leads to an underground auditorium, and at least once a year press are invited inside to see the next Apple products announced.</p>
      <p>The large, doughnut-shaped ring of Apple Park is the main building where some 12,000 Apple employees work. The campus is also eco-friendly, blurring the line between indoors and outdoors with four-story glass windows, large orchards that supply fruit for the cafeterias, and solar panels on the roof.</p>
      <p>The building is even designed to be <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-park-spaceship-campus-floats-to-protect-against-earthquakes-2019-6">earthquake proof</a>, according to former design chief Jony Ive. He told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/us/apple-headquarters-earthquake-preparedness.html">New York Times</a> that he and former CEO Steve Jobs considered preparing for natural disasters essential to the design of the new headquarters.</p>
