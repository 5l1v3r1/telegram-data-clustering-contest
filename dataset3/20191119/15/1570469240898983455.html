      <p>The U.N. human rights office said on Tuesday that some <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/hong-kong-protesters-defy-lams-surrender-warning-as-authorities-struggle-to-free-university-campus-263094">Hong Kong demonstrators'</a> resorting to extreme violence, including against police, was "deeply regrettable and cannot be condoned" and voiced concern that the situation could deteriorate further.</p>
      <p>Spokesman Rupert Colville urged Hong Kong authorities to de-escalate the situation at the Polytechnic University - where about 100 protesters are holed up - and address the humanitarian situation of those inside "which is clearly deteriorating".</p>
      <p>Hong Kong's embattled leader <a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/university-protesters-in-hong-kong-must-surrender-to-resolve-stand-off-peacefully-carrie-lam-263037">Carrie Lam said</a> on Tuesday she hoped the standoff between police and a group of anti-government protesters at the university could be resolved and she had told police to handle it humanely.</p>
      <p>Dozens of Hong Kong protesters staged a dramatic escape from a university campus sealed off by police on Monday by shimmying down plastic hosing from a bridge and fleeing on waiting motorbikes as the police fired projectiles.</p>
      <p>Many more anti-government protesters remained trapped inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and two prominent figures were allowed by police onto the campus late on Monday to mediate, a sign that there is a growing risk of bloodshed.</p>
      <p>Polytechnic University in Hong Kong's Kowloon district is at the centre of a standoff in the past week that has seen the most intense violence in five months of anti-government demonstrations.</p>
      <p>Some of the protesters who escaped on Monday lowered themselves several metres from a bridge they had occupied on the campus to a flyover below. They then sped off on the back of motorcycles that were already waiting or arrived quickly.</p>
      <p>A number of them appeared subsequently to have been arrested, a Reuters witness said.</p>
      <p>Other protesters, hurling petrol bombs, tried repeatedly to break into the campus but police fired tear gas and water cannon to push them back.</p>
      <p>The United States expressed concern about the situation but China's ambassador to London accused Western countries of interfering.</p>
