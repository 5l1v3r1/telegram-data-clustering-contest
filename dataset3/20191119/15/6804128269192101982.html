      <h2>Harry Winks was speaking ahead of Tottenham's match at London rivals West Ham United</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:30</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks has sent a warning to West Ham United ahead of the clash between the two sides on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Hammers welcome Spurs to the London Stadium for the key encounter as Mauricio Pochettino's men look to return to winning ways.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/harry-winks">Winks</a> and his side sit 14th in the Premier League and eleven points adrift of the Champions League places.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who was recently on international duty with England and bagged his first goal for the Three Lions, insists that it's a must-win game for <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>"It's going to be an interesting game. We need to win and they do as well. It will be an exciting game for the fans. We have to start picking up wins," Winks told talkSPORT.</p>
      <p>"We have got a lot of games coming up in such a short space of time. It's going to be a tough period. It's an exciting time and a time to kick on and climb the table."</p>
      <p>Winks was also asked about West Ham's threats for the game and he was naturally quick to praise Hammers' star Declan Rice after spending time with the midfielder whilst on international duty.</p>

      <p>"Declan is a top player and a threat. I have got to know him personally. Great lad. I'm 23 and Declan is 20. What he's done in such a short period of time is incredible," Winks added.</p>
