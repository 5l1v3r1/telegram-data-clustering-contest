      <h1>Lizzo Being Sued By Postmates Courier</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:37:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://collegecandy.com/author/candidwithconstance/" target="_blank">Constance Kalpakis</a></address>
      <p>After placing an order on the food delivery app, Postmates, Lizzo had failed to receive her order, putting the delivery woman at fault. By sending a since now deleted tweet saying, “Hey @Postmates this girl Tiffany W. stole my food. She lucky I don’t fight no more,” along with a photo of Tiffany, she completely exposed her to the millions of people that follow the singer-songwriter.</p>
      <p>The Postmates courier, Tiffany Wells, is suing Melissa Jefferson, a.k.a. Lizzo, on account of libel, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. The former Postmates worker has expressed fear of leaving the house where someone may recognize her as she was receiving “direct threats of violence” which caused her to be “feared for her physical safety.”</p>
      <p>A lot of Lizzo’s fans took it upon themselves to attack and threaten Tiffany, but also stood up for her by criticizing Lizzo’s behavior for inappropriately putting someone who doesn’t share the same voice as her on blast.</p>

      <p>Lizzo has since tweeted, “I apologize for putting that girl on blast. I understand I have a large following and that there were so many variables that could’ve put her in danger.” And again stating, realizing the responsibility of her platform, “Imma really be more responsible with my use of social media and check my petty and my pride at the door.”</p>
      <p>As far as the truth goes, Tiffany claims to have successfully attempt to deliver Lizzo’s order to the Revere Hotel in Boston, and had even extended Postmate’s policy of leaving after five minutes to waiting ten minutes until she had given up. She had even asked the staff of the hotel for someone named “Bonnie V,” but was told there was no one staying there by that name.</p>
      <p>“With celebrity status comes great responsibility,” Tiffany Wells’ attorney, Michael Rose stated. “In this age of social media, Lizzo has incredible influence in the public sphere, and broadcasting our client’s identity – along with falsely accusing Ms. Wells of stealing from her – to her vast number of followers invited threats against our client and forced a private individual into the public eye without her consent. This sort of behavior, from Lizzo or any celebrity, cannot be tolerated. I am confident in Ms. Wells’ claims and have faith that the justice system will bring a fair and just resolution in her favor.”</p>
      <p>A representative on Lizzo’s behalf has yet to make any comments, but I’m sure Lizzo is facing the consequences of her actions with integrity.</p>
