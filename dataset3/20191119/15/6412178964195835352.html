        <b>Manchester City posted record revenue of £535million and a profit – £10.1m – for the fifth consecutive year, according to the club’s annual report.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Figures for the 12 months ending June 2019 show revenue above the £500m mark for the second successive year and it is understood the club expect that to rise to closer to more than £560m next year having signed a lucrative kit deal with Puma.</p>
      <p>The club’s wage-to-revenue ratio stands at 59 per cent.</p>
      <p>“This outcome represents not just a season, but a decade of hard work,” said chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, with the club in its second decade of ownership under <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/sheikh-mansour-remains-as-committed-as-ever-to-man-city"><b>Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed.</b></a></p>
      <p>“The organisation is now at a level of maturity that enables us to plan on multi-year cycles both in terms of our management of squads and more widely across the business.</p>
      <p>“This strategic planning has allowed us to create an environment in which continued on-pitch success is both possible and likely, and financial sustainability is a reality.”</p>
      <p>Chief executive officer Ferran Soriano believes the club are well placed to continue a sequence which saw them win three trophies last season and 10 major honours since 2012.</p>
      <p>“We can all be sure that we will be focused, resilient and consistent in our approach,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Victories are not accidents; they are the product of careful planning, consistent hard work and the acknowledgement of the need to stay humble and hungry.”</p>
