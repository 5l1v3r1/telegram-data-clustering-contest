      <p>A non-Christian couple are taking legal action over their five-year-old daughter receiving religious teaching at her school in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>High Court proceedings have been brought against the Department of Education and the Education Authority, claiming that it breaches their human rights.</p>
      <p>A judge confirmed that the challenge will be heard early next year.</p>
      <p>The case centres on legislation which makes Religious Education (RE) and acts of collective worship compulsory in Northern Ireland schools.</p>
      <p>Parents are unable to withdraw their child on the grounds of conscience.</p>
      <p>Applications for a judicial review are being taken on behalf of the girl and her father, who have both been granted anonymity.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the family are contesting arrangements which involve religious instruction at the school they chose for the child.</p>
      <p>According to their case it unlawfully offends the parents' non-Christian outlook.</p>
      <p>At a preliminary hearing, Mrs Justice Keegan declined to rule that the girl lacks legal standing to bring a case.</p>
      <p>She identified issues around parental preference for a child who has not yet reached the age of maturity, but is the person affected and holds her own autonomous rights.</p>
      <p>"At this stage I'm going to have to reserved on this until I hear and analyse the facts of the case in the round," the judge said.</p>
      <p>"At the minute I'm going to continue to allow both the father and child (represented by counsel) to make submissions before me."</p>
