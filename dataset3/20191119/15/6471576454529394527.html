      <p>First things first, the 4C Spider for North America hasn‚Äôt been updated one bit as opposed to the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2020-alfa-romeo-giulia-stelvio-still-don-t-feature-full-led-headlights-139104.html">Giulia and Stelvio for the 2020 model year</a>. The price tag also happens to be higher than those two, starting at more than $67,000 excluding destination charge. The Italia package is arguably the most stunning to look at, featuring Misano Blue Metallic paintwork, Piano Black for the air intake and aerodynamic diffuser, and a plaque on the center console.</p>
      <p>The<i> ‚ÄúFormula 1-inspired carbon fiber monocoque chassis‚Äù </i>is put together at the Maserati factory in Modena, conjoined to a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and dry-clutch DCT. The powerplant‚Äôs cubic centimeters pay tribute to the 1750 engine from the 1960s, yet the 1.75-liter is an old design considering that it was also used by the Giulietta Quadrifoglio Verde some five years ago.</p>
      <p>Tuned to develop 237 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, you‚Äôll have to keep that engine in check without any power steering assistance whatsoever. The lightweight sports car is much obliged to send the suck-squeeze-bang-blow to the rear axle for a 0-to-60-mph time of 4.1 seconds. What about maximum velocity? Make that 160 miles per hour, thank you very much!</p>
      <p>Tipping the scales at less than 2,500 pounds, the 4C Spider is available in no fewer than six colors for the exterior. In addition to the Italia-exclusive Misano Blue Metallic, Alfa Romeo sweetens the deal with Rosso Competizione Tri-Coat, Alfa Rosso, Basalt Gray, Black, and White paintwork.</p>
      <p>The interior also features six possible combinations between black and red leather upholstery with red, yellow, black, tobacco, or yellow stitching and microfiber inserts.</p>
      <p>Only 238 units of the 4C were sold in 2018 in the United States, almost a third of the 2015 zenith. Coincidence or not, this means the 4C is the rarest Alfa Romeo currently in production. üèÅ</p>
