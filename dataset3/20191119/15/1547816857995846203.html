        <b>Rashami Desai is undoubtedly one of the most popular contestants of Bigg Boss 13. We spoke to her Rakhee brother and co-star Mrunal Jain and in our exclusive chat, the actor addressed her link-up stories with Sidharth Shukla, Arhaan Khan, apart from taking a big stand for the actress</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rashami Desai is one of the most talked about contestants in the ongoing season of Bigg Boss. On one side, the Uttaran actress has been receiving appreciation and love from her fans, while on the other side some are calling her gestures ‘fake’. We spoke to her Rakhee brother and co-star Mrunal Jain and here’s what he had to say:</p>
      <p><b>Are you following Bigg Boss 13?</b><br/>I am trying to follow the show. But at times, miss it due to my hectic schedules. However, I closely observe the clippings on social media. And when I see Rashami inside the house, I feel she was better off outside.</p>

      <p><b>And why do you say so?</b><br/>I understand that's it's a game but seeing her grapple with trust issues and loneliness, makes me worried. And most importantly, I miss her. </p>

      <p><b>Is Rashami the same in real life as she is in Bigg Boss 13?</b><br/>Absolutely! It's just that I haven't seen her shouting and crying like this in real life. If you cry on a daily soap you will get TRPs, but not on this show. So if you see her crying or venting out in Bigg Boss, understand that she must be actually feeling sad about something. She is not doing it for support and one can't fake cry repeatedly. <br/><br/><b>What do you have to say to the audience watching Rashami?</b><br/>Please support Rashami, not because I am telling you, but because she is deserving and has given so much to TV.</p>

      <p><b>What do you have to say about past rumours around Rashami and Sidharth Shukla’s affair? Were they together anytime?<br/></b>Yes, I read several articles and I even confronted Rashami on the same. She denied it to me and I trust her because we have a very open relationship and she doesn’t hide anything from me.<br/><br/><b>Do you feel Sidharth Shukla is targeting your sister in the house?</b><br/>I don't want to comment on that but after reading some tweets about them, I’m also confused if their fight is genuine or just a strategy.<br/><b> </b></p>

      <p><b>If Bigg Boss was offered to you, would you say a yes?</b><br/>I was offered to be part of the show, but I can’t do it. I have nothing against the house, but the show doesn't motivate me at all. <br/><br/><b>So which reality show is on your mind?<br/></b>Khatron Ke Khiladi! I really want to do it, but unfortunately the show never got offered to me. I just hope that I get the opportunity to associate myself with the show in the next season.<br/><br/><b>Speaking of Rashami’s love life, is she dating Arhaan Khan?</b><br/>All I know is she has a liking for him, but people have declared them a couple already.</p>

      <p><b>So apart from Rashami, who else are you rooting for in the house?</b><br/>Arti Singh, as she is a close friend of mine. And I think she is playing the game quite well. But, I will always be biased towards Rashami. <br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:-gorzavel/wikibiodata/twitter/siddhartistheb1/spotboye</i></p>
