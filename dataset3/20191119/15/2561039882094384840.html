      <p>Apple is planning to update the 13-inch MacBook Pro with a scissor switch keyboard in the first half of 2020, reports DigiTimes. The design would likely be the same as the keyboard on the new <a href="https://amzn.to/331Z1Uk">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>.<br/><br/><i>Apple's new 13.3-inch MacBook Pro series slated for launch in the first half of 2020 will also feature a scissor-switch keyboard, a design found in its recently-introduced 16-inch MacBook Pro lineup, according to industry sources. ODM Wistron and Global Lighting Technologies (GLT), a provider of light guide plates, are both among the suppliers for the keyboards for use in the devices.</i><br/><br/>At this time, It's unclear if Apple plans to update the 13.3-inch MacBook Pro to a 14-inch display.
