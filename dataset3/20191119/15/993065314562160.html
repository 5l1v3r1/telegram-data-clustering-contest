      <p>The jury presiding over a murder trial arising from the death of a west Belfast mother-of-three was discharged by a senior judge.</p>
      <p>As the trial at Belfast Crown Court was due to enter its second day, a legal issue arose which prompted a defence application to discharge the six men and women on the jury and which resulted in the trial being halted.</p>
      <p>The case against Raymond O'Neill was opened by a prosecuting barrister on Monday, when a jury was told it was the Crown's case that he murdered Jennifer Dornan (30) in her west Belfast home in the early hours of Sunday August 2, 2015.</p>
      <p>The 41-year old, from Amcomri Street in Belfast, was also charged with arson with intent to endanger life, and denied both this and the murder charge.</p>
      <p>As the hearing was due to enter its second day, the application was made to Mr Justice Horner, who granted it and discharged the jury.</p>
      <p>Expressing an apology to all those involved in the hearing for the delay, Mr Justice Horner then re-listed the trial to start again in the New Year.</p>
