        <b>It’s now possible to download <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2019/10/ubuntu-20-04-release-features">Ubuntu 20.04</a> daily builds for testing!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Freshly spun ISOs of what will go on to become Ubuntu’s next long-term support release (aka 20.04 LTS) will be produced every day from now until shortly before the final, stable release makes an appearance in April 2020.</p>
      <p>Prior to today (November 19, 2019) only “pending” live images had been available on the <a href="http://www.cdimage.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu CD image server</a>. Now ‘Current’ images — these are images that have passed a series of automated tests — are available.</p>
      <p>This is an important milestone in the development cycle.</p>
      <p>Many testers — do pop up in the comments if this includes you! — will install a ‘current’ daily build and ride it like a rolling release distro, installing any and all updates released to the Focal Fossa development as and when they arrive.</p>
      <h3>Ubuntu 20.04 Daily Builds</h3>
      <p>As you can gather from their name, Ubuntu 20.04 daily builds are <b>not</b> considered stable (especially early on in the development cycle).</p>
      <p>Ubuntu 20.04 daily builds will contain bugs and broken packages, and you may encounter many usability and/or stability issues as features are added (and in some cases removed).</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>So to be absolutely clear: Ubuntu daily builds should only be used by developers, testers, and well-intentioned enthusiasts, rather than end users.</p>
      <p>But like I mentioned, daily builds <b>are</b> a great way to ‘ride’ the development cycle. Once you have installed a ‘current’ daily build you can, in theory, keep installing updates as they are released right up until release day.</p>
