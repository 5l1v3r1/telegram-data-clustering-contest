      <p>Private Internet Access, a popular <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn">VPN</a> provider, is set to have a new owner, after Kape Technologies announced its intention to acquire the parent company (and creator) of PIA, LTMI Holdings (London Trust Media).</p>
      <p>The deal is for $95.5 million according to a report by Vox Markets, consisting of $52.9 million cash, and the issue of over 42.7 million new Kape shares which will also pay off London Trust Media’s existing $32.1 million debt (making the total enterprise value of LTMI $127.6 million in the acquisition).</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Kape describes itself as a cybersecurity company focusing on giving consumers better digital protection, and the operation has already bought two other high-profile VPN providers previously – namely <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/zenmate">ZenMate</a> (acquired last year) and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/cyberghost-vpn">CyberGhost</a> (picked up the year before).</p>
      <p>Clearly, Kape is serious about gobbling up turf in VPN territory, and the firm notes that PIA has over a million paying customers, and that almost half of these are based in the US.</p>
      <p>This will double Kape’s existing user base to make for over two million paying subscribers across the globe.</p>
      <h4>Name changer</h4>
      <p>Assuming the acquisition goes ahead as planned – subject to the usual regulatory approval – it’s expected to be finalized in early 2020, and Kape says it will then adopt the Private Internet Access name.</p>
      <p>Kape CEO, Ido Erlichman, commented: “This transaction makes our vision a reality by creating one of the most prominent privacy companies globally. In one acquisition, I believe we have positioned Kape to fast become one of the leading digital privacy service providers in the world, empowering consumers to manage their own data and digital security.”</p>
      <p>As well as the core VPN business, Private Internet Access has various other strings to its privacy bow, including an encrypted search engine (Private.sh) and a privacy-focused browser called LibreBrowser.</p>
      <p>When we reviewed <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/private-internet-access-vpn">Private Internet Access</a>, we were highly impressed with the VPN on the whole, so it’s not surprising that the service makes the cut for our roundup of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/best-vpn">best VPN</a> providers.</p>
