      <p>The Wisconsin Department of Health has <a href="https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/outbreaks/index.htm">announced</a> this week that there are 20 cases of E. coli illnesses in the state – 1 of which has developed a severe complication of E. coli infection called hemolytic uremic syndrome. At this time, the health authorities are unsure of the source of the outbreak, but several ill people reported eating “lots of salads” before becoming sick. Despite the lack of source, the Wisconsin health authorities are still considering this a confirmed <a href="https://www.makefoodsafe.com/could-romaine-be-the-source-of-the-wisconsin-e-coli-outbreak/">Wisconsin E. coli outbreak</a>.</p>
      <p>The agency commented on its website that, “DHS is working with local public health departments to interview sick individuals to learn more about their activities, food and water sources, and foods and beverages they consumed before they became sick to identify any potential common source of infection.” The investigation is ongoing.</p>
      <p>While the investigation continues, health agencies recommend residents keep an eye out on their symptoms. Symptoms of an E. coli infection usually show within 2 to 10 days after eating food contaminated with E. coli. Keep on the lookout for the tell-tale signs of the infection: vomiting, nausea, watery (sometimes bloody) diarrhea, abdominal pain, and (potentially) low-grade fever.</p>
