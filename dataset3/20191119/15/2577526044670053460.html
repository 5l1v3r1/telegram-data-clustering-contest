      <h1>CS:GO's New Skins Are Already Selling for More than £1,000</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:29:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Jones</a></address>
      <p>Last night’s <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i> update introduced the new <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/11/19/csgos-new-update-introduces-fortnite-style-skins">Shattered Web operation</a>, bringing in unique character models as well as a host of new weapon skins. Those cosmetics are already proving pretty lucrative, as community demand has already driven prices up into four figures.</p>
      <p>The most expensive weapon is the Gungnir skin for the powerful AWP sniper rifle. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AWP%20%7C%20Gungnir%20%28Factory%20New%29">Nine have sold already</a>, with the most expensive shifting for £1,006.23, or just over $1,300. Another AWP, the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/StatTrak%E2%84%A2%20AWP%20%7C%20Containment%20Breach%20%28Factory%20New%29">Containment Breach</a>, is on the market for £777, although the highest buying price currently sits at just under £400.</p>
      <p>When it comes to another popular gun, the AK-47, asking prices are even higher. Currently, the only person selling the new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/730/AK-47%20%7C%20Wild%20Lotus%20%28Factory%20New%29">Wild Lotus</a> skin is asking for £1,350 for it, although again, the community has shown it’s not willing to pay quite that much - the current highest buying price is £717.</p>
      <p>While these are certainly some expensive cosmetics, when it comes to CS:GO, weapon skins have reached far higher prices. Last year, another AWP skin sold for nearly £50,000. The game’s economy has, however, caused Valve some problems in recent months - the company was forced to ban key resales last month after <a href="https://www.kotaku.co.uk/2019/10/29/valve-bans-csgo-key-resales-over-money-laundering-concerns">discovering that the in-game items were being used as part of a global money laundering scheme</a>.</p>
