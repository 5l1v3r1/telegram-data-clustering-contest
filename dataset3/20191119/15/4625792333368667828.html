      <p>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman snapped at ranking Rep. Devin Nunes after he referred to him as “Mr. Vindman.”</p>
      <p>During his <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-opening-statements-from-alexander-vindman-and-jennifer-williams">public impeachment testimony</a> on Tuesday, Vindman was taking a line of questioning from Nunes when the California Republican referred to him as “Mr. Vindman” rather than his official military title.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower,” Nunes said.</p>
      <p>Vindman replied, “Ranking member, it’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.”</p>
      <p>Nunes corrected Vindman’s title and repeated the question. Vindman claimed that he was advised by his attorney not to answer questions related to the whistleblower.</p>
