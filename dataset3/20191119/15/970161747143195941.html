      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/wayne-rooney/">Wayne Rooney</a> is among hundreds of famous faces in line for a major tax refund after winning a battle against HMRC.</p>
      <p>A host of celebrities ploughed money into a £263m scheme, which allowed them to claim tax relief in return for investing into a project to build two data centres.</p>
      <p>675 people paid a combined total of £79million towards the Tyneside based development in 2011, and got £131million in relief.</p>
      <p>But the taxman argued that those involved – including comedian Jimmy Carr and football manager <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsene-wenger/">Arsene Wenger</a> – benefited excessively from tax cuts.</p>
      <p>In 2016, HMRC sent so-called ‘accelerated payment notices’ (APN) demanding those involved to hand over more money in tax.</p>
      <p>After some appealed to the tax tribunal the case went to the High Court, which ruled against HMRC.</p>

      <p>The ruling yesterday means some of the investors who have already paid tax demands will be able to claim money back.</p>

      <p>It is not clear how much each celebrity had put into the scheme, and there was no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of those involved.</p>
      <p>The tax relief was meant to start economic growth in deprived areas – but HMRC said it amounted to ‘tax profit’.</p>
      <p>The scheme’s allowances meant investors could claim 50% tax relief on the full £263million cost of the project, even though their total investment was only £79 million.</p>
      <p>Many said at the time that were pleased to be investing in schemes they hoped would create jobs in the North East.</p>
      <p>Two judges, Mr Justice Zacarol and Judge Jonathan Richards, ruled that the schemes did qualify for relief.</p>

      <p>The sites were completed in 2012 and 2013 and are designed to house computer servers belonging to businesses and government organisations.</p>
      <p>However, the court heard that since the data centres have been completed, efforts to find a tenant have been ‘unsuccessful’.</p>
      <p>The judges said: ‘At no point since the appellants acquired their interests in the Data Centres have those Data Centres been let.’</p>
      <p>Other celebrities who had invested into the scheme include Roy Hodgson, the late Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt, and Lady Elizabeth-Ann Redgrave, wife of Olympic legend Sir Steve.</p>
      <p>The case threatens to drag on further, with judges giving HMRC the right to appeal.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Zacaroli said: ‘We invited further submissions from the parties as to how the apportionment of the price that which does and that which does not qualify for EZAs is to be calculated.’</p>

      <p>A HMRC spokesperson said:  ‘We are disappointed with the decision and are considering an appeal.’</p>
