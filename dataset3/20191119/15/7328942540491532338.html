      <h3>The Battista EV Hypercar</h3>
      <p>In under <b><a href="https://automobili-pininfarina.com/hypercar-of-the-future/">12 months</a></b>, Automobili Pininfarina will start the production of the Battista, a mere <b>eight months</b> after its unveiling. There will be no more than <b>150 bespoke</b> Battista cars ever to circulate our Earth.</p>
      <p>The Battista will deliver a combination of up to <b>500 km</b>, and go from <b>0 to 62 mph</b> in <b>under two seconds</b>.</p>
      <p>It's a one-of-a-kind emissions-free car. </p>

      <p>When speaking about the EV Hypercar Experience, <a href="https://automobili-pininfarina.com/hypercar-of-the-future/">Heidfeld</a> said: "This amazing Hyperdrive experience is just one step in the Battista customers’ intimate journey with us, and a major step towards making car enthusiasts fall in love with electric power."</p>
      <p>The future owners of the Battista Hypercars will be well watched as they circumnavigate the <b>nine</b> right-hand corners and <b>seven</b> left-hand corners of the Circuit de Calafat.</p>
      <p>Learning about the power and the technology behind such electric race cars will undoubtedly offer them an advantage when they receive the keys to their Battistas. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, it'll certainly whet their appetites. </p>
