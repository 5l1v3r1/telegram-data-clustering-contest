      <h1>Khabib Nurmagomedov’s Father Causes Furor Online After Saying He Wants Second Wife</h1>
      <h2>According the top mixed martial artist’s dad, his religion allows him to take up to four wives if he wanted to.</h2>

      <p>Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, father and personal coach of undefeated MMA champion Khabib Nurmagomedov, has suggested that he is seriously considering a second wife.</p>
      <blockquote>“I have one wife, and plan to get a second. As for a third, I don’t know if this will happen,” the trainer said, in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xAb3DAl7P0&amp;feature=youtu.be">interview</a> with the Mir 24 TV channel.</blockquote>
      <p>According to Abdulmanap, his plans are not in conflict with his Islamic faith. “The Almighty appeals to men and says ‘take two, three, four wives. Even a disabled person can have just one wife,” he said, before adding that in any case, “one must always respect a woman.”</p>
      <p>At the same time, the veteran trainer said that he is always comfortable with his first wife.</p>
      <blockquote>Polygamous marriages are not officially recognised under Russia’s Family Code, although de facto polygamy is not a crime in the criminal code. The custom is sometimes observed in Russia’s Caucasus Republics, whose population is mostly Muslim, but has sometimes sparked legal conflicts with federal courts.</blockquote>
      <p>As expected, the elder Nurmagomedov’s announcement caused a mixed reaction online, with many Russian MMA fans wondering what he was thinking.</p>
      <p>“And then they wonder why in Russia fans root more for MacGregor than for his son,” one user angrily <a href="https://twitter.com/maxiteam3/status/1196708384558370816">wrote</a>. “Disgusting!” another <a href="https://twitter.com/Marla12347013/status/1196701019322953728">added</a>. “His wife probably thinks that her old husband has gone completely insane,” a third <a href="https://twitter.com/whND4dTcv7kHzko/status/1196574851726761984">chimed in</a>. “Oh he wants one does he? So what? It’s not bad for your health to want something,” another <a href="https://twitter.com/Alexvolf60/status/1196543509903421448">quipped</a>.</p>
      <p>Others joked that perhaps it would be a good idea after all, particularly if Abdulmanap could father another Khabib. “That’s right. This will mean at least five more Khabibs. We’ll fill the UFC octagon with blood,” one commenter <a href="https://twitter.com/ovisariezzz/status/1196714469889626112">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>A few even expressed support for the elder Nurmagomedov.  “Nothing to do in such a situation except to wish him health!” one user <a href="https://twitter.com/tolikho/status/1196730323943510016">wrote</a>. “Why only a second? The man’s strong, wealthy, he can allow himself six,” another <a href="https://twitter.com/Alpetrovich/status/1196710808232906752">added</a>.</p>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has yet to comment publicly on his father’s apparent plans. The undefeated UFC champion defended his world title in a fight against US mixed martial artist Dustin Poirier in September. Last month, Irish UFC fighter Conor McGregor, who got trounced by Khabib at UFC 229 in Last Vegas last year, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201910251077152754-conor-mcgregors-moscow-hotel-on-security-lockdown-over-his-comments-about-dagestanis---reports/">came to Moscow</a> to call the fighter out for a rematch. Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov indicated that his son might agree to a rematch, but only after a fight with veteran US MMG star Tony Ferguson.</p>
