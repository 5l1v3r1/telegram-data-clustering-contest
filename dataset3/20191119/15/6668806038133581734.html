        <b>Her beauty advice to fans:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just stick to what suits you personally. Don't try to copy any looks. Don't put so much makeup on your face. If you are focusing on your eyes don't focus on your lips. If you are focusing on your lips don't focus on your eyes. </p>
      <p>
        <b>One beauty advice  she likes</b>

      <p>One sentence my mother keeps saying to me is beauty is as beauty does so what you do is what makes you beautiful. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Beauty regime:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I just take a little dahi, haldi and honey, I put this on my face. I love make-up but I believe simple is effective.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Fitness regime:</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don't like to go to the gym. I just dance. I started dancing when I was 4 years old. I think the best workout you can do is Zumba and dance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you believe in diets?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don't diet. I eat everything I'm moderation. I feel lucky that I don't put on weight. So I don't need a dietitian. If I am shooting I eat healthily. I avoid white sugar and too much rice because it bloats. </p>
