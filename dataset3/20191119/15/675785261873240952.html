      <h1>General Election puts minimum wages rises on hold for millions of workers</h1>
      <h2>More than 2.4million people have been left in limbo over how much their wages will rise next year after Chancellor Sajid Javid called off the Autumn Budget - which is typically when new rates are announced</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:31:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>Millions of workers have been left in the dark over what they will be paid next year because of Boris Johnson's decision to call a last minute <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> .</p>
      <p>New hourly rates for the following April are typically announced in the Autumn Budget, however chancellor <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/sajid-javid-mp">Sajid Javid</a> called this year's spending review off, amid election talks and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> delays, leaving at least 2.4million people in limbo.</p>
      <p>In the normal course of events, the Low Pay Commission (the body that sets the rates) would present its recommendations for increasing the national minimum wage by the end of October, with the Government setting out its response and confirming any changes in November.</p>
      <p>However, this being cancelled effectively leaves workers - and employers - unaware of how salaries will change in the new year.</p>
      <p>A snap election now means that there will be no announcement about new minimum wage rates until at least mid-December, or possibly not until January, once a new Government takes office and the relevant minister has decided what to do with the Low Pay Commission’s recommendations.</p>
      <p>One possibility is that the Low Pay Commission may still publish its report and recommendations as planned.</p>
      <p>However, it is not clear if this will go ahead.  It has previously spoken of plans to make the rate £8.67 for those aged 25 and over.</p>

      <p>What we do know is that the current Government has set a target to increase the National Living Wage to £10.50 an hour by 2025.</p>
      <p>This was announced by Chancellor Sajid Javid at the Tory Party Conference in September as part of his plans to "help the next generation of go-getters to get ahead".</p>
      <p>When it reaches £10.50, it will be two-thirds of the average wage. It is likely to affect one in four employees and will be extended to all employees aged 21 and over by the mid 2020s.</p>
      <p>Labour, meanwhile, said if it forms the next Government, they will raise the National Living Wage to £10 an hour in 2020 and to include all workers under 18 - who currently get a minimum wage of £4.35.</p>
      <p>For over 25s, it currently stands at £8.21 - but the Living Wage Foundation says it should already be £9 across the UK and £10.55 for those in London.</p>

      <p>The National Minimum Wage is the lowest amount employers can charge you without breaking the law. The rate changes based on your age if you are an apprentice. If you're 25 or older, you qualify for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/is-national-living-wage-rising-9317417">National Living Wage</a> instead.</p>
      <p>Both rates are a legal requirement, and failing to meet them could result in the employer being fined and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/wagamama-tgi-fridays-marriot-hotels-12152315">featured in the annual list of shame</a> .</p>
      <p>The rules state that if you're working and aged 25 or above (and not in the first year of an apprenticeship), your hourly rate must be at least £8.21.</p>
      <p>Find out if you are eligible for the National Living Wage by using this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/am-i-getting-minimum-wage/y">useful calculator</a> .</p>
      <h3>What is the current minimum wage?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Bosses legally have to pay workers the following rates:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Aged 25 or over: £8.21 an hour</li>
        <li>Aged 21-24? £7.70 an hour</li>
        <li>Aged 18-20? £6.15 an hour</li>
        <li>Aged below-18? £4.35 an hour</li>
        <li>Apprentice? £3.90 an hour</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>There are a few rules to follow:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Apprentices are entitled to the apprentice rate if they’re either a) aged 19 or under or b) aged 19 or over and are in their first year of apprentiship.</li>
        <li>To qualify for the minimum wage, you must be at school leaving age (16 years or older).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What's the difference between the National Living Wage and Living Wage?</h3>
      <p>The 'National Living Wage' and the 'Minimum Wage' are both set by the Government and all employers must comply.</p>
      <p>However the 'Living Wage' is a completely separate entity set up by the <a href="http://www.livingwage.org.uk/who-pays-the-living-wage">Living Wage Foundation</a> . It's also reviewed annually.</p>
      <p>The latter is not a legal requirement, but more what campaigners believe workers <i>should</i> be earning (factoring in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/inflation-soars-wages-cant-keep-10622945">inflation</a> and so on). Many employers - such as supermarkets - have chosen it in favour of it over the government's guidelines and therefore pay their workers more.</p>
      <p>Currently the Living Wage stands at £9.30 an hour in the UK, or £10.75 if you live in London. The rates apply to all those aged 18 or over. <a href="http://www.livingwage.org.uk/who-pays-the-living-wage?qt-living_wage_schemes=0">Here is a full list of the employers that pay it</a> .</p>
      <h3>Read your pay slip</h3>
      <p>You are legally entitled to a payslip and should ask your boss if you don’t receive one automatically.</p>
      <p>Reading it will help you see how much you are earning and how much you are taxed. The <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/understanding-your-payslip">Money Advice Service</a> has a guide to help you decode it.</p>
      <p>There are a number of different ways you could be paid. If you’re paid by the hour, this should include travelling between different places of work - you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/minimum-wage-different-types-work/overview">find out the full rules here</a> .</p>
      <p>If you receive an annual salary, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/minimum-wage-different-types-work/paid-an-annual-salary">calculate your pay per hour</a> . Even if you are paid for a specific piece of work, there is a fair hourly rate - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/minimum-wage-different-types-work/paid-per-task-or-piece-of-work-done">work it out here</a> .</p>
      <p>If you work in a restaurant, your boss should <u>not</u> pay you out of your tips. <i>The Mirror</i> 's <a href="https://www.blogs.mirror.co.uk/investigations/2008/07/victory-for-mirror-and-unites.html">Fair Tips campaign</a> helped secure a law protecting workers back in 2018.</p>
      <h3>What to do if you think you're being paid unfairly</h3>
      <p>If you believe you're being underpaid, you should seek advice on the matter as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>You can find out what your entitlement is using the <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1902">Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service's [Acas] Helpline Online tool.</a></p>
      <p>Acas is a free body that provides information and advice to employers and employees on employment law.</p>
      <p>If you find you are in fact being unfairly paid, it is advised that you talk to your employer first, and try to resolve the issue.</p>
      <p>If this doesn't work, you are within your rights to file a formal grievance to your employer.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, Acas says a worker can make a complaint to HMRC who will investigate it for you.</p>
      <p>If HMRC finds that an employer has failed to keep up with the minimum wage, they can send a notice of arrears plus a penalty for not paying the correct rate of pay to the worker.</p>
      <p>The maximum fine for non-payment will be £20,000 per worker. However, employers who fail to pay could be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years.</p>
      <p>If you want further advice, call the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-and-work-rights-helpline">Pay and Work Rights Helpline</a> on <b>0800 917 2368</b> . The service is free and confidential.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, try approaching the <a href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/">Citizens Advice Bureau</a> [CAB]. Their advisers can assist you with a range of money and legal matters for free.</p>
