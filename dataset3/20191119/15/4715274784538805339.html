      <p>Robinsons Bank President Elfren Antonio S. Sarte led the ringing of the bell which marks RBank’s second listing of Corporate Bonds in the PDEx platform. The event was also graced by BDO Capital and Investment Corporation President Eduardo V. Francisco, FMIC Vice President and Sales and Distribution Head Peter Anthony D. Bautista, and PDEx President and COO Antonino A. Nakpil.</p>
      <p>The P5.0 Bn Corporate Bond is the second tranche of the Bank’s P10.0 Bn Corporate Bond Program for 2019. In relation to its bond issuance, Robinsons Bank was assigned an issuer credit rating of PRS Aa minus by the Philippine Rating Services Corporation (PhilRating) with a Stable</p>
      <p>Outlook for its proposed P2.5 Bn issuance, with an oversubscription option of P2.5 Bn.</p>
      <p>“On the second tranche of the Bank’s bond issuance, we are deeply honored by the trust and confidence of the investing public that made this bond issuance 4.3x oversubscribed,” RBank President Elfren Sarte said in his speech at the listing ceremony.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the selling agents for this issuance are BDO Capital &amp; Investment Corporation, the First Metro Investment Corporation (FMIC), and Amalgamated Investment Bancorporation (AIB), alongside Robinsons Bank.</p>
      <p>The net proceeds from the issuance will be used primarily to support and finance the Bank’s lending activities. The Offer will also allow the Bank to diversify funding sources, optimize the deployment of funds, and sustain proper management of the liquidity ratios.</p>
