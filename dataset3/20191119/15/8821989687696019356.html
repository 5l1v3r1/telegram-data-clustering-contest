      <h1>15 Years Ago: Black Friday: The End of Van Hagar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:31:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Kielty</a></address>
      <p>On Nov. 19, 2004, at the Anselmo Valencia Amphitheater in Tucson, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/sammy-hagar/">Sammy Hagar</a> completed his last show with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/van-halen/">Van Halen</a>, walked offstage, caught his flight and never spoke to <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/eddie-van-halen/">Eddie</a> or <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/alex-van-halen/">Alex Van Halen</a> again.</p>
      <p>It was a sad but predictable end to what had once been an exciting, ambitious endeavor. No wonder some fans call it “Black Friday.”</p>
      <p>The auspices had been good. <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/gary-cherone/">Gary Cherone</a> had been <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/gary-cherone-leaves-van-halen/">gone</a> for five years, paving the way for <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sammy-hagar-van-halen-reunion-2004/">Hagar to return </a>earlier in 2004 and add his vocals to a compilation album, <i>The Best of Both Worlds</i>, ahead of a world tour. It wasn’t that simple, though; it became clear that Eddie Van Halen’s health issues, which included drug addiction along with recovery from cancer, were going to curtail the plans.</p>
      <p>The LP was released as a best-of set, with three new tracks – “It’s About Time,” “Up for Breakfast” and “Learning to See” – apparently the sum total of the studio songs the guitarist was capable of completing. A North American tour was announced, which started with 28 shows but ran to 80. By the end of that run, though, there was little left of “Van Hagar” to save.</p>
      <p>

      <p>“As crazy it as it seems, the last time I spoke directly to them was after the last show on the 2004 reunion tour,” Hagar told <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/sammy-hagar-interview-diamond-dave-the-van-halens-and-a-long-life-in-rock"><i>Classic Rock</i></a> in 2019. “We played Tucson, Ariz., and we walked offstage and said, ‘See you later.’ We all got our private planes home, and we never talked again. ... I’ve tried. I’ve reached out a couple of times.  About three or four years ago I wished Eddie a happy birthday on Instagram, and he got back to me – or his Instagram person did – and said, ‘Hope you’re doing well, thank you.’ And that was it. That’s the way it is.”</p>
      <p>At one show, Eddie reportedly laid down on the stage and told the audience, “I’m sorry, folks, I done run outta gas,” though he finished the performance. Hagar said it was painful to see an old friend in such a condition. “I would just show up for sound check," Eddie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsPZkFEScjg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=25m48s">said</a> at the time. "And I go, 'Hmm, why do extra laundry?' So, I would just wear whatever I'm wearing, then take my shirt off and play."</p>
      <p>“What happened on that reunion tour in ’04 was some of the most miserable, backstabbing dark crap I’ve ever been involved with my whole life,” Hagar later <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sammy-hagar-van-halen-reunion-2004/">said</a>. In another interview, he <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/sammy-hagar-i-dont-see-a-new-van-halen-record-happening-393416">remembered</a>, “I saw the guy right in front of my eyes not be able to write and forgetting how to play songs. Eddie's problems are all from drugs and alcohol, and all of it self-inflicted – nobody was driving him to it. … Eddie's not tortured by anything but Eddie."</p>
      <p>But that wasn’t the only bone of contention. The Van Halen brothers didn't want <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/michael-anthony/">Michael Anthony</a> to take part in the reunion, but when Hagar stipulated it as a term of his own involvement, they relented – while forcing the bassist to sign away his full rights as a member and working only as a salaried session musician.</p>
      <p>“Eddie didn't even want me to be a part of that because he was so torqued up that I was buddies with Sammy," Anthony <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sammy-hagar-van-halen-reunion-2004/">said</a> in 2009. "With those guys, it was a cut-and-dried situation.” Plus, Eddie wasn't happy with the way Hagar’s Cabo Wabo tequila business was being promoted along with the tour.</p>
      <p>It was all so different when Hagar originally joined Van Halen back in 1985. “At that stage, I had a good career going, I was wealthy, I was eating in the finest restaurants and wearing the finest fucking clothes, I was driving Ferraris,” he recalled. “I was becoming a little too sophisticated – it was killing my music. Whereas those guys were living a completely different lifestyle. … Eddie comes walking out with a pair of sunglasses, jeans with holes in them, just outta bed, cracking a beer and smoking a cigarette. Alex was still drunk. Mike hadn’t even been home. They’d been up all night waiting for me. I’m looking at these guys, then I’m looking at myself in a suit, and I go, 'I look like a fucking idiot. This is a real rock ’n’ roll band.'”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>By 2004 everything changed beyond recognition. Seeing the writing on the wall once again, Hagar tried to quit before the end of the tour but was forced to stick it out after threats of a lawsuit. “I didn't do that tour for money, I did it for the fans,” he <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/sammy-hagar-i-dont-see-a-new-van-halen-record-happening-393416">said</a> in 2009. “I wanted the band to come back and be great again. We didn't get there, and I tried to bail. But they and their management … had me sewn in, and I was stuck. I had to go through with the rest of the tour. It was hell.”</p>
      <p>Hagar later described “Black Friday” as “the worst show we’d ever done in our lives,” noting that Eddie “played so bad” that night. Reports suggest the guitarist smashed his instruments in anger, tearfully telling the audience, “You don’t understand.”</p>
      <p>“Van Hagar” ended officially soon afterward, and neither Hagar nor Anthony have shared a stage with the Van Halen brothers since. Eddie and Alex have all but ignored that era, with songs like “Runaround,” “Humans Being,” “Poundcake,” “Why Can’t This Be Love,” “Best of Both Worlds,” “Right Now” and “When It’s Love” rarely performed. They went on to <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/van-halen-david-lee-roth-reunion-2007/">reunite</a> with original siger <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/david-lee-roth/">David Lee Roth</a>, though he said in 2019 that the band was over. Hagar formed <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/chickenfoot/">Chickenfoot</a> with Anthony, <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/joe-satriani/">Joe Satrian</a>i and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/chad-smith/">Chad Smith</a>, and later the Circle, who released <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/sammy-hagar-the-circle-concept-album/"><i>Space Between</i></a>, a 2019 concept album about greed.</p>
      <p>“The Van Halen brothers will not allow me to do any of my own songs on TV,” Hagar <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sammy-hagar-if-i-joined-van-halen-right-now-id-feel-like-a-hypocrite-187291/">stated</a> in 2015. "They can’t stop me from doing them live, because they’ve tried and they can’t. They want to pretend like Van Hagar never existed. The only No. 1 albums they’ve had in their life, and they want to pretend like they never happened. I don’t know why they hate me so bad, but I guess I’m too happy for them.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Asked if he thought he’d ever speak to Eddie again, Hagar said, “I would hope so. Because that would be really sad if any one of us — I’ll put myself in the same category — took this to our graves. That is not where you take things. I would rather go to my grave with no enemies left. I just don’t think that would feel right. But who knows? Whatever. It’s not my decision, because I was the one they pushed out and tried to fuck over. To me, it’s up to them to come back and say they’re sorry.”</p>
      <p>But, he added, “I still have more fun than anybody on the planet. My mind still works, my voice still works, my dick still works, my heart is still good and I got a memory, I’m rich and famous, and I got a beautiful family. Dude, if you see me going around with a bad look on my face, hit me on the shoulder and say, ‘Aren’t you Sammy Hagar?’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh yeah, you’re right!’”</p>

      <h3>The Best Song From Every Van Halen Album</h3>

      <h4>'Van Halen' (1978): "I'm the One"</h4>
      <p>Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing understandably dominated nearly every conversation about Van Halen's debut album. But he wouldn't have sounded nearly as great if he wasn't also part of a razor-sharp band. Years on the cover-band circuit had allowed the foursome to absorb and tinker with the best songwriting from a variety of genres. That's probably why they didn't think twice about interrupting one of Eddie's revolutionary guitar riffs with a good old-fashioned doo-wop breakdown.</p>

      <h4>'Van Halen II' (1979): "Dance the Night Away"</h4>
      <p>The other not-so-secret weapon in Van Halen's arsenal was their knack for writing great pop hooks. This gift was rarely placed on display as unabashedly as it was on the wistful "Dance the Night Away," but Eddie Van Halen told Van Halen News Desk it wasn't a strategic decision. "I can't help it if I come up with a poppy-sounding riff. We just do what we come up with, as opposed to forcing ourselves to come up with something commercial."</p>

      <h4>'Women and Children First' (1980): "Everybody Wants Some!!"</h4>
      <p>Having burned through the best of their pre-fame song stash on their quickly recorded first and second albums, Van Halen was afforded a bit more time for studio experimentation on 'Women and Children First.' They coupled this freedom with the lessons they'd learned about working in front of massive arena and stadium crowds over the previous two years, and came up with some truly widescreen-ready songs. As with the earlier "I'm the One," "Everybody Wants Some!!" gets the nod by being the best showcase for all four musicians, separately and together. It remains the centerpiece of their concerts to this day.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Fair Warning' (1981): "Unchained"</h4>
      <p>Eddie Van Halen was admittedly in a bad mood for much of the recording of 'Fair Warning' – chafing, among other things, at the no multi-tracking production rules put in place by producer Ted Templeman. Van Halen's frustration is palpable throughout the album, which is much darker, angrier and more serious than their previous records. The group continued to push into new territory, such as the synth-rock "One Foot Out the Door" and the dub-influenced "When Push Comes to Shove." But it's the most traditional riff-rocker on the album, "Unchained," that gets the prize here. This song is the reason every wannabe guitar player in your high school bought a flanger, and the lyrics feature a bit more of Van Halen's familiar celebratory vibe than the rest of 'Fair Warning.'</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Diver Down' (1982): "Little Guitars"</h4>
      <p>Along with its album mate "Secrets," this is one of the most lovely and evocative songs Van Halen ever released, with a gorgeous distorted guitar refrain that showed they didn't need to turn to keyboard ballads to be romantic. It's also proof positive they <i>could</i> have found a way to gracefully mature with Roth in the fold, if they had been able to overcome their personal and creative differences.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'1984' (1984): "Panama"</h4>
      <p>Of course, the big news on '1984' was the introduction of keyboards, with hit singles "Jump" and "I'll Wait" rocketing the band to even higher levels of popularity. The rest of the album was entirely guitar-focused, and as if to reassure longtime fans that everything was still in its right place, they put the best of the bunch – featuring perhaps Eddie's most undeniable riff ever – right after the album-opening "Jump." Bonus points to Roth for subverting the "song about a car but really it's about sex" cliche by actually singing about the car.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'5150' (1986): "Best of Both Worlds"</h4>
      <p>The biggest what-if in Van Halen history will always revolve around what a follow-up to '1984' might have sounded like with Roth on vocals. Emboldened by the mainstream success of "Jump," and now paired up with a stronger (if less unique) singer in Sammy Hagar, Van Halen of course doubled up on the keyboards this time out. But as he did with "Little Guitars," Eddie (clearly inspired by his new songwriting partner) also proved there was still room for the band's guitar-based material to get more sophisticated. On "Best of Both Worlds," Hagar rises to the challenge with one of the most thoughtful and well-sung lyrics of his entire career.</p>

      <h4>'OU812' (1988): "Cabo Wabo"</h4>
      <p>Van Halen get the Led out on this one, stretching on Eddie's best 'Physical Graffiti' riff for nearly seven minutes. The lyrics aren't deep – it's about being drunk on a beach, after all – but Hagar and Van Halen's tag-team vamping makes it the clear highlight of a very diverse but sometimes spotty album. The song's title also became the name of the tequila brand that made Hagar a bazillionaire.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge' (1991): "Poundcake"</h4>
      <p>"Back to basics" was the rallying cry for Van Halen's third album with Sammy Hagar, with only "Right Now" built on anything except electric guitars. The most innovative of the rock songs, "Poundcake" is also clearly the best. Eddie's use of a power drill on the intro got all the press, but the more essential addition was doubling up on the main riff with a 12-string guitar for extra texture.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>'Balance' (1995): "Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)"</h4>
      <p>Both Hagar and his soon-to be former bandmates later admitted they didn't get along during the creation of their fourth album together. It shows. This was also after the grunge wave hit, so the subject matter is suddenly dark and serious – and unlike 'Fair Warning,' it doesn't feel authentic. Lead single "Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do)" is a relative highlight, but strictly in a "it's kinda interesting to hear Van Halen pretend to be Soundgarden" way. "That song didn’t take us anywhere, and I know why now," Hagar later told the A.V. Club. "It wasn’t what Van Halen fans wanted. It showed the darkness of Van Halen, and basically the end of the band."</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>''Van Halen III' (1998): "Once"</h4>
      <p>Van Halen's attempt to catch lead-singer lightning in a bottle three times didn't work. But this album does feature a handful of interesting musical ideas, chief among them the atmospheric, meditative "Once." If this had turned up instead on a Gary Cherone solo album, with Eddie Van Halen guesting, maybe people would have said, "hey, that's pretty cool you should do more stuff like that." (Or, maybe not: It's still too long.)</p>

      <h4>'A Different Kind of Truth' (2012): "She's The Woman"</h4>
      <p>After nearly 30 years, Roth returns. But they prevent the circle from fully closing, however, when bassist Michael Anthony and his pivotal background vocals depart. Some people needlessly complained about the album being partly made up of reworked unreleased tracks from the band's early days, but so what? Why, exactly, do you want those to stay in the vault? For the most part, 'A Different Kind of Truth' was a welcome return to familiar territory. Roth's voice was naturally more weathered, but he still knows how to both compliment and compete with Van Halen's guitar better than anybody else. On "She's the Woman," he drops the funniest line ("She wanted something to regret – tomorrow morning") while Eddie is still wringing the final notes out of another dazzling solo.</p>
