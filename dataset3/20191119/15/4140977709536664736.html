            <b>Laxman Sivaramakrishnan tipped to become the next BCCI chief selector amidst the scheduled meeting of controlling board of India cricket.</b>
          </p>
          <p>The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will be having its annual general meeting (AGM) on December 1. Hence, there are strong rumours that Laxman Sivaramakrishnan will be appointed as the next chief selector on the board.</p>
          <p>The talk is about the selection committee and about the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) that will appoint the selectors. With the tenure of MSK Prasad coming to an end, former Indian spinner Sivaramakrishnan is tipped to take the throne.</p>

                <p>Like MSK Prasad, Khoda will also leave the committee, also Ashish Nehra from North, Deep Dasgupta and Rohan Gavaskar from East are also been discussed. From the West Zone, Jatin Paranje and Ajit Agarkar and Dilip Vengsarkar are being discussed as well.</p>

                      <p>AGM has to zero in on CAC and it has become a daunting job for the new BCCI. With so much focus through the conflict of interest clauses on the CAC members, not many candidates seem to be coming forward, since there are no assurances of payment.</p>

                          <p>Meanwhile, MSK Prasad is reportedly set to land a lucrative commentatory deal and will be joining it soon after his tenure ends. He is certain for Telugu commentary but his contemporary views and his experience as the chairman of selectors may even be tapped in programs like Select Dugout.</p>

                            <p>With this, it is remained to see whether Sivaramakrishnan will be given the job at the BCCI or will we see a new name to pose the suitability for the job.</p>
