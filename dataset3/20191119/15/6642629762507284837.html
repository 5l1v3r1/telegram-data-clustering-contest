      <p>British musician Paul McCartney will take star billing at next year's Glastonbury, when the legendary <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-kingdom.html">UK</a> music festival marks its 50th anniversary, organisers said.</p>
      <p>Glastonbury coorganiser Emily Eavis said the former Beatles star would headline the Pyramid Stage on June 27 - the traditional highlight of the event in Somerset, southwest England.</p>
      <p>"Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true," she said in a statement on the festival's website on Monday.</p>
      <p>"There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary."</p>
      <p>McCartney previously headlined Glastonbury in 2004. This year's headliner was grime star Stormzy.</p>
