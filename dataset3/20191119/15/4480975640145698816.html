      <h1>UK Elections: Fresh poll shows 18-point lead for Conservatives – GBP/USD positive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:15:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/yohay-elam" target="_blank">Yohay Elam</a></address>
      <p>An opinion poll conducted by Kantar has shown that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have enlarged their lead to 18 points against Labour. The ruling party receives 45%  a leap of 8 points from the firm's previous poll, while Jeremy Corbyn's party holds its ground at 27%.</p>
      <p>Nigel Farage's <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> Party has collapsed to only 2% against 9% in Kantar's previous market research. The right-wing outfit has pulled out candidates from most constituencies, to help the Conservative Party. </p>
      <p>Investors prefer the certainty of Johnson's Brexit deal and the Tories' more market-friendly polices against the uncertainty of a hung parliament and renegotiation of the Brexit deal. The news is positive for <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">the pound</a>. Sterling traders are awaiting a debate between the leaders later today. </p>
