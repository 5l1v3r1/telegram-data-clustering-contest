        <b>Rohm has announced the availability of 200V low-IR Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) designed for automotive applications including powertrains, industrial inverters and various types of power supplies.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The RBxx8BM/NS200 expands on the RBxx8 lineup of SBDs enabling high temperature. This series offers low leakage current characteristics to achieve withstand voltage of 200V.</p>
      <p>Replacing fast recovery diodes (FRD) and rectifier diodes typically used in vehicle systems with Rohm’s new SBDs make it possible to improve forward voltage (VF) characteristics by 11%, the company claims. This allows smaller package designs by reducing heat generation, contributing to greater space savings.</p>

      <p>Rohm has been offering the RBxx8 lineup of low-IR SBDs that withstand up to 150V compatible with high temperature automotive environments. This latest series adds 200V models to meet the new automotive requirements.</p>
      <p>One drawback of SBDs is degraded IR characteristics at higher operating temperatures that can lead to thermal runaway, requiring products that provide stable operation at higher temperatures.</p>
      <p>The RBxx8 series utilizes a barrier metal designed for high temperatures which improves the IR characteristics.</p>
      <p>These low IR values allow Rohm to achieve withstand voltages up to 200V. It’s therefore possible, the company says, to replace the FRDs traditionally used in automotive systems with high efficiency SBDs.</p>
      <p>Rohm is currently also developing medium power packages, with plans to decrease mounting area by as much as 71% by replacing 5.9×6.9mm FRDs with 2.5×4.7mm products.</p>
      <p>The addition of these eight 200V models brings the total number of products in the RBxx8 lineup to 212.</p>
