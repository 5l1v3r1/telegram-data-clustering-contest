      <h2>A man whose a cat was mauled to death by a dog has called for its owner to have a longer jail sentence.</h2>

      <p>Amos Price, 30, was seen dragging his dog towards the white and black cat sitting on a garden wall in Walsall in CCTV footage.</p>
      <p>Before letting go of the lurcher's collar, he looked around to check he was not being watched and pulled his hood up over his baseball cap.</p>
      <p>On being freed, the dog leapt up and pulled the terrified cat, called Cleo, off the wall with his teeth and savaged her to death.</p>
      <p>The father-of-two was arrested after video footage of the attack in Woodlands Crescent, Pelsall, on October 23 was released by police.</p>
      <p>When his cat failed to return home the following day, Gary Truefitt checked his security camera and was horrified to discover the fate of his long-time companion, said Ms Helen Shipley, prosecuting at Walsall Magistrates Court.</p>
      <p>Price, of Trevor Road, Pelsall, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary cruelty to a protected animal.</p>
      <p>Passing sentence, Mr Brian Benton, chairman of the magistrates, who imposed the maximum sentence given Price's guilty plea – 18 weeks, said he would have jailed him for longer if he had not been restricted by the law.</p>
      <p>Price was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to Mr Truefitt and a £122 victim surcharge to the court, and was disqualified for life from keeping an animal.</p>
      <p>Mr Truefitt told BBC WM: "It's not long enough, it needs to be over 12 month I think at least.</p>
      <p>"I know the RSPCA are trying to get a longer sentence for him.</p>
      <p>"To go around and do that deliberately to somebody's pet it's disgusting, and to me he's got away with it."</p>
