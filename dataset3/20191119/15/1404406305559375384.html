      <p>Lavar Ball has found most of his sons being the subject of the media’s speculation, with LaMelo Ball being in the spotlight as of late. Many have been trying to figure out the next move LaMelo will make.</p>
      <p>Ball’s manager Jermaine Jackson commented on how people are trying to exploit his client before he even reaches the NBA. Jackson said “People done made money off this kid for years. I don't really want to use the word, but it's damn near like he's a prostitute." LaMelo spoke on the attention he’s getting, saying “People don't look at you as a human," he says. "People look at you as a dollar sign."</p>
