      <p>Farmers in Melmalai areas of Palani hills can soon store their produce for a longer time and improve marketing of the same. A storage facility with a capacity of 10,000 metric tonnes apart from a garlic smoking and carrot washing units are set to come up at Poondi village, near Kavunji here.</p>
      <p>At the farmers’ grievances meeting held in Bryant Park on Tuesday, the Revenue Divisional Officer, Kodaikanal, A.V. Surendran, announced that the construction will start in a week or 10 days. “We have identified a government land of 1.38 acres. The project is being done under the Agriculture Marketing Department’s Supply Chain Management scheme to promote hill produce,” he said.</p>
      <p>The facility is expected to benefit farmers in the villages of Kavunji, Vadakavunji, Kilavarai, Kookal, Gundalpatti, Mannavanur and Poombarai who produce carrots and hill garlic in huge quantities apart from a variety of vegetables.</p>
      <p>The much acclaimed hill garlic or ‘malai poondu’, known for its piquant flavour and taste, was accorded with a Geographic Indication (GI) tag recently.</p>
      <p>“Though the production is good, we lag behind in marketing. Farmers in Ooty and the Nilgiris are able to market their produce better as they have a storage facility. This facility will help us store perishable products for a longer time and manage price fluctuation. We can sell them when there’s a favourable market price and store them when the price dips,” said T. Jeyamurugan, a carrot farmer from Kavunji.</p>
      <p>An official from the Agriculture Marketing Board, Madurai, said that the facility would be constructed at a cost of ₹8 crore with aid from NABARD.</p>
      <p>“Currently, the farmers smoke the garlic in their kitchens above earthen stoves. The smoking facility will ensure thorough removal of moisture content. It will also enhance the shelf life and quality of the garlic and in turn improve market prospects and value,” he said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the carrot washing facility is a hygienic technique and will ensure thorough washing against the present manual method of washing.</p>
      <p>There will be separate storage for both the produce with a capacity of 5,000 metric tonnes each.</p>
      <p>“Currently, we send the produce to Madurai, Vadakkampatti and Nilakottai markets on a daily basis. Only if we send it daily, we can capitalise on the produce. Else, they will perish. But the storage facility can help us reach a wider market area,” said R. Vadivelan, farmer from Poondi.</p>
      <p>“After the GI tag, the hill garlic market has picked up quite well. The prices are steady and favourable and there’s more demand from newer markets. It has opened up opportunities for the crop,” he added.</p>
