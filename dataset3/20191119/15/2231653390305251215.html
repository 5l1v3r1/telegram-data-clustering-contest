      <p>Make 2020 the year you unify, empower, and cross-train your marketing team. <a href="https://marketinglandevents.com/smx/west/team-rates/?utm_source=sel&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=smx+west+2020&amp;utm_content=teams">Send them to Search Marketing Expo</a> – SMX West – February 19-20 in San Jose for an immersive and rewarding team-building experience.</p>
      <p>The Search Engine Land experts have redesigned and reorganized the <a href="https://marketinglandevents.com/smx/west/agenda-at-a-glance/?utm_source=sel&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=smx+west+2020&amp;utm_content=teams">agenda</a> into 3 lanes with no limits: <a href="https://marketinglandevents.com/smx/west/seo-sessions/?utm_source=sel&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=smx+west+2020&amp;utm_content=teams">SEO</a>, <a href="https://marketinglandevents.com/smx/west/sem-sessions/?utm_source=sel&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=smx+west+2020&amp;utm_content=teams">SEM</a>, and new content devoted to <a href="https://marketinglandevents.com/smx/west/digital-commerce-marketing/?utm_source=sel&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=smx+west+2020&amp;utm_content=teams">digital commerce marketing</a>. Your team will divide and conquer 60+ sessions (3x more sessions than last year!) loaded with actionable tactics and proven solutions that can take your company to a new level of success.</p>
      <p>Teams that come to SMX learn about more than search… they learn about what it takes to win:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Executing successful marketing campaigns requires blending different skills, experiences, and backgrounds. <b>Attending together will equip your team with a common vocabulary and vision of success.</b> Connecting the dots between organic and paid search, content, and cross-channel attribution will become second nature.</li>
        <li>Smart marketers never stop learning. Your team’s educational journey at SMX will <b>help them connect what they learn to how they execute back at the office</b>. They’ll expand their knowledge in a meaningful, productive way – instead of just learning new concepts in a vacuum.</li>
        <li>Technology is the key to delivering delightful customer experiences. At SMX, your team will quickly and efficiently evaluate dozens of time-saving solutions in the Expo Hall and <b>find the right technology for your company’s needs</b>.</li>
        <li>No one achieves anything on their own. Interacting with the search marketing community will <b>boost team morale and connect them with smart, friendly, like-minded people</b> who want to share advice, trade ideas, and discuss ways to overcome common marketing obstacles.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Send more, save more</h3>
      <p>There’s one more reason you should attend as a group… the more people you send, <a href="https://marketinglandevents.com/smx/west/team-rates/?utm_source=sel&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=smx+west+2020&amp;utm_content=teams">the more money you save</a>:</p>
