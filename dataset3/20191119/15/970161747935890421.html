      <p>It’s easily the most exciting bit of Christmas but this year, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> reunion which sees the latest cast unleash their claws for the confrontation of confrontations, won’t be coming in 2019.</p>
      <p>While we’ve been counting down the days for Amber Gill and Greg O’Shea’s first meeting since <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/09/love-islands-amber-gill-claims-greg-oshea-dump-text-makes-first-tv-appearance-since-split-10710737/">he dumped her by text (according to her), </a>it’s not going to happen.</p>
      <p>‘The cast don’t think there are any plans for a Christmas reunion like last year, but they haven’t been given a straight answer,’ a source told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/reality/love-island-christmas-special-reunion-20914334">OK! Online</a>.</p>

      <p>‘A few of the islanders have seen the producers since leaving the villa and there was a bit of a reunion at the ITV Palooza! last week and the topic was brought up but quickly shut down.</p>
      <p>‘Questions were asked about the possibility of an on-screen reunion, but they were all ignored by producers.’</p>
      <p>So alas, we’ll never know what would have happened when Amber finally got some answers from Greg; what really went down between India Reynolds and Ovie Soko, and if Chris Taylor and Harley Brash were actually a thing. Is Anton Danyluk’s mum still shaving his bum now Belle Hassan is out of the picture?</p>

      <p>You’re guess is as good as ours.</p>
      <p>However, while there won’t be any catfights over the Christmas pudding, there is a second helping of Love Island instead and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caroline-flack-heads-cape-town-filming-winter-love-island-officially-begins-11181828/">Caroline Flack has already touched down in Cape Town</a> to film the first ever Winter series.</p>
      <p>Although, speaking to Metro.co.uk, she’s already <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/caroline-flack-heads-cape-town-filming-winter-love-island-officially-begins-11181828/">dreading the hellish commute.</a></p>
      <p>‘It’s a long old flight just to do that walking,’ she told us. ‘It’s a 13 hour flight! I’ve got to go back and forth the whole time to do Aftersun over here.’</p>
