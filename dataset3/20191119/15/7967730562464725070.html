      <p><b>London: </b>The UK's former Tory leader William Hague has warned that tens of millions of citizens will take climate change action into their own hands if governments continue to fail to address the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>Delivering a blunt warning to Britain's peak farming body, the National Farmers Union (NFU), the former Foreign Secretary also warned that the UK's longer-term problems were not Brexit-related and said there was no excuse for the government failing to prepare for the geopolitical shifts set to occur in coming decades.</p>

      <p>Hague made the comments in a wide-ranging lecture in honour of Henry Plumb - a doyen of the British agricultural sector and past president of the NFU.</p>
      <p>Hague, who <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52zma.html">reinvigorated the Australia-UK relationship</a> when foreign secretary under David Cameron and is currently <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p523kh.html">president of the London-based Britain-Australia Society, </a>said the rise in veganism, estimated population growth in the Middle East and Africa and the great decoupling between China and the United States were some of the greater threats Western democracies faced.</p>
      <p>But the Tory grandee said all these challenges, and even the risk of another financial crisis, were superseded by the climate change emergency that has been <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p537mo.html">declared by 11,000 scientists</a>.</p>

      <p>Both London and Australia's major cities have been disrupted in recent months by <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52yep.html">Extinction Rebellion protesters</a> who say their drastic action is warranted to bring attention to the climate emergency.</p>
      <p>The emotionally charged speech made by the 16-year old Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg to the United Nations, in which she warned that climate inaction was stealing her childhood, also captured global headlines.</p>
      <p>Hague warned against dismissing these trends given that global emissions are still rising.</p>
      <p>"It's important not to underestimate the speed and the impact with which public concern will now rise on this subject, including the possibility that tens of millions of people, if they believe that governments are not taking sufficient action, will take their own direct action, coordinated on social media in terms of what they're prepared to do or not do and what they're prepared to buy," Hague told those gathered at The Royal Society.</p>
      <p>He said farmers should not underestimate the rapid shift towards plant-based diets from people cutting back their meat intake to try and reduce their personal carbon footprints.</p>

      <p>"Eating habits usually change slowly but this is an unprecedented situation with an exceptional level of public concern and it seems to be that some eating habits are now changing rather quickly," he said.</p>
      <p>Hague said it was vital the agricultural sector take part in the climate change debate and work with scientists to be the solution rather than be "swept away" by climate campaigners.</p>
      <p>"Many activists on the climate change issue believe we can only succeed by having less active lives or less human ambition and giving up on economic growth," he said.</p>
      <p>"This will not work as it conflicts with human nature. We will only succeed actually if we go with the grain of the human desire to improve and advance and pioneer and use our ingenuity so we should be pushing the borders of science and engineering," he said.</p>
      <p>Both Britain's major parties are committed to being carbon neutral by 2050 but the NFU's has an even more ambitious goal, pledging the sector will be net-zero by 2040.</p>
      <h3>Collapse of capitalism, not Brexit, the greatest challenge</h3>
      <p>Hague said while Brexit was important for Britain to resolve, it would not be the "main determinant of what happens to us as a country over the decades to come."</p>
      <p>"There are some huge issues globally that we can see coming and there's no excuse for not thinking about their implications well in advance," he said.</p>
      <p>He warned that the historically low interest rates set by central banks in countries like the UK, Australia, the United States in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008 were driving risky investments which could lead to another economic crash.</p>
      <p>"We have had emergency financial measures for so long now, of ultra-low interest rates and negative interest rates that I believe capitalism itself is being undermined by those measures,' he said.</p>

      <p>"People driven into riskier, riskier assets, zombie businesses continuing at very low-interest rates and eventually a risk of an economic crash with very little room for manoeuvre by central banks," he said.</p>
      <p>On China, he said there would be a need for "visionary leadership" to chart a common ground between Beijing and the United States as they jostled for geopolitical, technological and economic supremacy.</p>
      <p>And he warned that the explosion in population growth in the Middle East and Africa would determine the future of Europe. If it was mismanaged it would drive nationalism, and anti-immigration sentiment far greater than that already seen.</p>
