        <b>The company announced an all new validated design for the Domino Data Science Platform, as well as four new reference architectures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dell Technologies on Tuesday <a href="https://corporate.delltechnologies.com/en-us/newsroom/announcements/detailpage.press-releases~usa~2019~11~20191119-dt-introduces-new-solutions-to-advance-high-performance-computing-and-ai-innovation.htm#/filter-on/Country:en-us">announced</a> several updates to its high-performance computing (HPC) portfolio, including new services that aim to simplify and accelerate HPC and AI deployments.</p>
      <p>Key updates include an all new validated design for the Domino Data Science Platform, as well as four new reference architectures -- optimized for Intel Xeon Scalable processors -- with AI partners including DataRobot, Grid Dynamics, Iguazio and Kubeflow on Red Hat OpenShift.<br/><br/>Additionally, the company introduced expanded capacity for Dell EMC PowerVault ME4, designed to deliver HPC storage in a smaller form factor. Dell also unveiled the Dell EMC PowerSwitch Z9332F-ON, a 400GbE open networking switch designed for high performance workloads.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dell also launched new turnkey services for the ArcaStream PixStor and ThinkParQ BeeGFS file systems. The new ThinkParQ service aims to speed up input/output intensive workloads, making it easier to scale from small clusters to enterprise-class systems either on premises or in the cloud. The new PixStor Storage service offers a parallel file system for performing archiving and analytics in place. <br/><br/>On the GPU side, Dell EMC announced new Nvidia GPU and Intel FPGA options across its server portfolio. Specifically, Nvidia T4 Tensor Core GPUs are now available as a new accelerator option for the Dell EMC DSS 8440 serve, along with Nvidia Quadro RTX for Dell EMC PowerEdge servers. The Intel FPGA Programmable Acceleration Card D5005 is also a new option for the PowerEdge R740xd and R940xa servers. </p>
