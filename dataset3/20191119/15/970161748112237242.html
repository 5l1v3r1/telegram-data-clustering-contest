      <p>A man who collapsed and died while waiting for an appointment in a Job Centre has been described as a ‘father figure’ by his ‘heartbroken’ younger brother.</p>
      <p>David Bevan, 62, known as Dai, suffered a suspected heart attack while in a queue at the centre in Llanelli, south Wales, on Friday.</p>
      <p>It <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/man-drops-dead-job-centre-queue-declared-fit-work-11174319/">was initially reported he was waiting for an appointment to discuss Jobseeker’s Allowance</a> after being declared fit for work despite having <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/diabetes/">diabetes</a> and a heart condition.</p>
      <p>This has been denied by a DWP source <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brother-man-who-died-heart-20912716">who told the Mirror</a> Mr Bevan was attending a regular appointment to claim his benefits.</p>
      <p>Mr Bevan’s younger brother Simon, 40, who rushed to the Job Centre to be by his sibling’s side, said: ‘He was a father a figure to me after my mum died when I was 13.</p>

      <p>‘I will miss him terribly but I just think it’s one of those unfortunate things, when your number’s up …’</p>
      <p>Mr Bevan, from Burry Port, died in a waiting room minutes after Simon arrived at the building.</p>

      <p>Staff and customers had rushed to help Mr Bevan but they were unable to get a response so lay him on the floor.</p>
      <p>They started CPR and an ambulance was called while the Job Centre was evacuated, but paramedics declared him dead at the scene after working on hi for 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>A witness said: ‘We were all very shook up, it was a horrible situation that should have never happened. The job centre is all shut down now.’</p>
      <p>Simon added he was not blaming anyone and did not know whether his brother had been declared fit to work.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Bevan, who was a former road layer and refuse collector, would not have wanted anyone blamed either and his death was ‘unfortunate’ and his ‘number was up’.</p>
      <p>Mr Bevan started receiving unemployment benefit in 2017 when he stopped working because of his health.</p>
      <p>Simon revealed his brother also had a heart scare in 2009.</p>
      <p>Mr Bevan, who enjoyed taking his German Shepherd Wally for daily walks, was a huge fan of rugby club Burry Port and a two-minute silence in his honour was observed before their match on Saturday.</p>

      <p>Simon also played for the club and his big brother would cheer him on.</p>
      <p>A DWP spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts and those of the staff at Llanelli Jobcentre are with the family and friends at this time.’</p>
