      <h1>EXCLUSIVE: National Broadband CEO: Signing of contract is 'historic day for Ireland'</h1>

        <b>The chief executive of National Broadband Ireland says the signing of the contract to deliver the National Broadband Plan is a "historic day for Ireland".</b>
      </p>
      <p>Peter Hendrick says it will take away "a digital divide that has been there for many years across urban and rural Ireland".</p>
      <p>He spoke exclusively to Newstalk's tech correspondent Jess Kelly about the signing of the contract.</p>
      <p>The contract for the â‚¬3bn National plan <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/national-broadband-plan-contract-926561">was signed by the Government</a></b> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Some 537,000 premises in 26 counties will be connected with superfast fibre broadband.</p>
      <p>The plan is to provide equal opportunity for 100% of the population - ensuring every household and business has access to high-speed broadband.</p>
      <p>Work on the plan is set to begin within the next eight weeks.</p>
      <p>Surveying and design teams will start work in early January in the first deployment locations.</p>
      <p>These include Carrigaline in Co Cork, parts of Connemara in west Galway, and several towns in the counties of Kilkenny and Limerick.</p>
      <p>Around 650 people will be employed directly and indirectly over the first 12 months of the NBP, and 90% of these will be employed locally in each of the deployment areas.</p>
      <p>Mr Hendrick said: It's a historic day for Ireland in terms of our commitment to delivering high speed broadband across the country".</p>
      <blockquote>"From today, we will start commencing design and build activities - so our contractors will start commencing design within the next six to eight weeks.</blockquote>
      <p>"You will start seeing NBI teams and vans across the country.</p>
      <p>"So within the first year, our plan is to start with what we call broadband connection points: which is about 300 broadband points around the country - approximately 11 to 14 per country - where people can access high-speed broadband.</p>
      <p>"These are in facilities such as community halls, schools, libraries or GAA facilities."</p>
      <p>He added that efforts to begin rolling out the wider fibre network would begin in 'parallel' with that process.</p>
      <p>"The first areas that we're going to start deploying that fibre network in is the likes of Carrigaline in Cork, parts of Connemara, Limerick and Kilkenny.</p>
      <blockquote>"And quickly in year two, we will have fibre roll-out in every single county in the country".</blockquote>
      <p>In terms of workers, Mr Hendrick explained: "We will have NBI branded vans around the country, but predominantly delivered by our sub-contractors".</p>
      <p>"Those sub-contractors are companies that are already delivering fibre across the country for other operators.</p>
      <p>"After year one, we'll quickly start ramping up: by year three, we expect to have 2,000 people involved in the roll-out of high-speed broadband across the country".</p>
      <p>Mr Hendrick also said he is "very confident" demand will be there once the network is built.</p>
      <blockquote>"We know that broadband, or internet in general, the consumption of it is increasing daily, and everybody needs connectivity - it's become a utility.</blockquote>
      <p>"So we expect absolutely by the time we get to half way through the contract period - years 14/15 - we absolutely expect that we see 80%-plus penetration on the network".</p>
      <p>National Broadband Ireland is a whole-sale operator, so will not be selling the service to homes and business directly - which Mr Hendrick says they have been working with closely.</p>
      <p>"Every operator will be able to buy from National Broadband Ireland at the same price, regardless of their scale or size", Mr Hendrick added.</p>
