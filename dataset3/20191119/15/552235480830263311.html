      <p>Dumfries and Galloway Blood Bikes has been handed a boost by the Provincial Grand Lodge of Galloway.</p>
      <p>The charity’s chairman David Hook recently met up with members at their lodge in Dalbeattie to receive a cheque for £1,350 from Provincial Master Dennis Warren.</p>
      <p>The money was raised by members at a race night at Creetown, a bowling competition at Newton Stewart, a golf competition at Glenluce and a dinner at Newton Stewart over the last few months.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>David said: “The donation of £1,350 is a welcome boost to the fundraising efforts for Dumfries and Galloway Blood Bikes. We are the only Blood Bike group that operates 24/7 365 days a year in Scotland and one of only a few in the UK.</p>
      <p>“The funds are a massive help towards us raising the £55,000 per year we need to raise to operate and maintain the fleet of bikes and cars. We currently cover over 15,000 miles per month transporting urgent and life saving products on behalf of the patients of our NHS. The charity is run entirely by unpaid volunteers for the benefit of the patients.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Dennis added: “We are proud to be able to support an incredible charity that provides help to so many within our region.”</p>
      <p>
