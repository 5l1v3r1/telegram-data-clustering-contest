      <h1>The EU’s Battle With Big Tech is Only Just Beginning</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:59:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macobserver.com/author/charlotte-henry/" target="_blank">Charlotte Henry</a></address>
      <p>The EU’s executive, the EU Commission, has increasingly turned its attention on Big Tech in recent times. It fined Apple $14.5 billion in 2016, and is looking at alleged competition issues around the Walle App.  At the center of it all is competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. <i>The New York Times</i> has a really good profile of her, picked up by <i>Cult of Mac. </i>It shows’ that the EU’s battle with Big Tech is only just beginning.</p>
      <blockquote>A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/technology/tech-regulator-europe.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share"><i>New York Times</i> article</a> writes that Vestager “envisions a more aggressive agenda” for moderating the tech industry. It notes that: “Ms. Vestager, a 51-year-old former Danish lawmaker, is doubling down. She has signed on for a rare second five-year term as the head of the European Commission’s antitrust division, and assumed expanded responsibility over digital policy across the 28-nation bloc…” There are few specifics in the article, aside from the overall sense that Vestager is looking to double-down on her moderating of tech companies. The European Commission is already looking into a number of tech giants. This includes the question of whether Apple is abusing its marketplace position with the App Store.</blockquote>
