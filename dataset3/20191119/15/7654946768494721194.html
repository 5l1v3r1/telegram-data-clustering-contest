      <h1>South Dakota governor doubles down on bizarre anti-drug campaign targeting meth</h1>

      <p>South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem doubled down on her state’s misguided <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/south-dakotas-new-on-meth-campaign-prompts-ridicule-confusion/">“Meth, We’re On It” anti-drug campaign</a> — which became an instant punchline on social media.</p>
      <p>“Meth is IN SD. Twitter can make a joke of it, but when it comes down to it – Meth is a serious problem in SD. We are here to Get. It. OUT,” Noem <a href="https://twitter.com/govkristinoem/status/1196564675401519104">tweeted</a> Monday night.</p>
      <p>The Republican chief executive followed up with another tweet saying that the state’s epidemic “needs to be a dinner table conversation.”</p>
      <p>“We need everyone on it,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/govkristinoem/status/1196600263378903040">tweeted</a>.</p>
      <p>The initiative’s logo was promoted on the site OnMeth.com and consisted of the confusing tagline stamped on an outline of the Mount Rushmore State.</p>
      <p>Nearly half a million dollars was spent on the anti-drug campaign, which featured digital and TV ads, including a video of adults and children saying, “I’m on meth,” <a href="https://www.argusleader.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/18/gov-kristi-noem-launches-anti-meth-campaign-meth-were-it/4227949002/">according to the Sioux Falls Argus Leader</a>.</p>
