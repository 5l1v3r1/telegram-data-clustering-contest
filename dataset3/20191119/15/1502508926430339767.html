      <p>Acceding to Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh's demand, IT giant <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>has removed the secessionist, anti-India mobile application '2020 Sikh Referendum' from its Play Store, state officials said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for the Chief Minister's Office said this app was not available any more on <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>Play Store for mobile users in India.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister, who had also urged the Central government to persuade <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-google">Google </a>in the matter, had asked the Director General of Police to coordinate with Central security agencies to tackle the threat resulting from the launch of the app, created by 'ICETECH'.</p>
      <p>The app had asked the general public to register themselves to vote in the 'Punjab Referendum 2020 Khalistan'.</p>
      <p>A website with the address of www.yes2khalistan.org was also launched on the same lines for the same purpose.</p>
      <p>The Cyber Crime Centre of the Bureau of Investigation of Punjab had moved to get the app removed from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/google-play-store">Google Play Store </a>and the website blocked for usage in India.</p>
      <p>On November 8, a notice under Section 79 (3) B of the Information Technology Act was sent to the Google for removal of the mobile application, added the spokesperson.</p>
