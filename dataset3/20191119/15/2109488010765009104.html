      <h1>US politicians call for appointment of 5G guru</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:31:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#dianagoovaerts" target="_blank">Diana Goovaerts</a></address>
      <p>A group of US politicians urged President Donald Trump to appoint a leader to coordinate the country’s 5G strategy, arguing a unified approach is needed to maintain technology leadership over China.</p>
      <p>In a letter, the politicians noted a number of different government agencies are working to push the technology forward, but said their efforts “are not informed by a coherent national strategy”. They pressed Trump to designate a senior official solely focused on the 5G issue, adding a “fractured approach will not be sufficient to rise to the challenge the country faces.”</p>
      <p>“A challenge of this magnitude requires a more ambitious response than traditional agency processes can support.”</p>
      <p>The letter was signed by the leaders of the Senate Intelligence, Homeland Security, Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees.</p>
      <p>Trump <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/trump-designates-5g-as-national-us-priority/">flagged 5G as a national priority</a> in 2017, and the following year <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/trump-nudges-us-to-free-more-spectrum-for-5g/">pressed federal agencies to develop a national spectrum strategy</a> to free up more airwaves for mobile deployments.</p>
      <p>But disputes over spectrum allocation and strategy have raged behind the scenes.</p>
      <p>Michael O’Rielly, a member of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in June noted spats with other agencies were hampering its efforts to open new spectrum bands for 5G and in September warned a move by the Department of Defence to <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/us-agencies-wrangle-over-spectrum-control/">develop its own spectrum strategy</a> could “jeopardise all commercial wireless allocations”.</p>
      <p>The internal disagreements appeared to contribute to the <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/top-three/key-trump-telecom-adviser-quits/">sudden resignation in May of a key official</a> responsible for advising the Trump administration on telecommunications issues. His departure came days after he spoke out against “inefficient” spectrum policy process which he said “too often devolves into a zero-sum game”.</p>
