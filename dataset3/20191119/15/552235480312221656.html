      <p>Gangland enforcer Ian 'Blink' MacDonald has been cleared of demanding money from a woman after claims that she is too ill to give evidence against him.</p>
      <p>MacDonald, 58, once <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">jailed</a> over a £6 million bank heist, was charged with threatening or abusive behaviour towards the woman.</p>
      <p>It was alleged he went to an office in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">Wishaw</a> , Lanarkshire, and the home of the woman's parents in nearby <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">Bothwell</a> and stared through windows.</p>
      <p>MacDonald, of Glasgow, was <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">accused</a> of demanding money from the woman - said to be a stranger to him - pursuing her and causing her to believe he was pursuing members of her family.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>His trial went ahead at Hamilton Sheriff Court today at the third time of asking, but without the woman, who was the main Crown witness.</p>
      <p>For the third time she produced a doctor's letter, saying she was medically unfit to attend and give evidence.</p>
      <p>Aga Mathieson, prosecuting, asked that the statement she gave police about the alleged incident in July last year be used instead.</p>
      <p>But Blink's lawyer, Laura Kiernan, said this would be unfair to her client as there would be no opportunity to cross examine the witness.</p>
      <p>Kiernan said the Crown should have explored other options such as having the woman testify via <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">videolink</a> or putting the case off until her mental health improved.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Linda Nicolson rejected the Crown move.</p>
      <p>The court was then shown <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">CCTV</a> footage of a man - said to be Blink - outside the home of the woman's parents.</p>
      <p>The woman's father said the man was not known to him.</p>
      <p>After his evidence Mathieson said she would not be proceeding with the trial and the sheriff told Blink he was free to go.</p>
      <p>MacDonald was once a feared enforcer for Glasgow crime lord Arthur Thompson.</p>
      <p>In 1992 he was jailed for 16 years for his part in a botched £6 million bank raid in Devon in which a teller was shot in the head.</p>
      <p>Then in 2009 Blink cheated death when gangland rivals tried to blow up his car in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/police-scotland-issue-more-1000-20721570">Riddrie</a> , Glasgow.</p>
      <p>Four years ago he was jailed for two months for a row with a fellow passenger on a flight from Glasgow to Fuerteventura.</p>
