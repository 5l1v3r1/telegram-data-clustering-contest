      <h1>These early Black Friday SSD deals start at under £90</h1>
      <h2>Update: Even more Samsung SSDs reduced!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:27:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:27</time> by <a rel="author">James Pickard</a></address>
      <p>The main event may still be over a week away, but Amazon has already gone live with a handful of tempting SSD deals in its <a href="https://amzn.to/35cbiqP">Countdown to Black Friday sale</a> if you're looking to bump up your PC's storage.</p>
      <p>This 1TB SanDisk SSD Plus leads the way as the best value deal of the bunch for only £87.99, but there's also a massive 30% off the 4TB Samsung 860 QVO if you're looking for a bulkier option.</p>
      <p>As someone who probably paid more than this years ago for a 250GB SSD I'm already considering either as an upgrade. The jump in performance when I first installed the drive was so significant that I'd easily recommend it to anyone looking for a quick and efficient way to speed up their PC. With this drive you'll have room to install more than just the OS and Final Fantasy 14 - unlike me.</p>

      <p>That's just the start of Amazon's range of SSD deals currently available, too. If you want to go for something even faster you can get the 1TB Samsung 970 EVO or EVO Plus. You'll have to pay a bit of a premium for this NVMe drive, but if speed really is of the utmost importance then you'll appreciate it. And, would you look at that, it's on offer in both the UK and US!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07MBQPQ62?tag=eurgam-m-21">1TB Samsung 970 EVO Plus NVMe M.2 Internal SSD for £154.99 from Amazon UK</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Lastly, you can also find the 1TB Samsung Portable SSD T5 as a limited time deal. Over at Jelly Deals, this drive has been a regular contender in our list of the best external hard drives for PS4. As it's a speedier SSD it's a pricier option, but if you're sick of console load times it can certainly help! Similar SanDisk portable SSDs are also available, too.</p>
