      <p><b>This year, actually this Sunday, the 2019 MTN Marathon will take place and from the look of things, all is set.<br/></b> <br/><b>Every November, it attracts Kampalans of all persuasions to Kololo Airstrip-like moths to a flame.<br/></b> <br/>Donned in yellow vests, running shoes and caps, the multitudes that turn up go at the different races they registered for with gusto.<br/> <br/>The MTN Kampala Marathon is always a spectacle-replete with hundreds of runners some intent on giving a good account of themselves in the different races they registered for and those inclined to taking selfies and slackness while they run.<br/> <br/>This year, actually this Sunday, the 2019 MTN Marathon will take place and from the look of things, all is set.<br/> <br/>The theme and routes may change but not what invariably happens when the runs begin.<br/> <br/>Many who have been training in and around Kampala-are geared up; ready to go for it, hammer and tongs.<br/> <br/>Here are some tips that will position you in good stead as you run.<br/> <br/>“I will start off with the Eliud Kipchoge move in perfect rhythm posture as you run.<br/>Needless to say, the Kenyan long-distance runner, always keeps a perfect posture as he runs and it’s the posture he kept when he obliterated the marathon in 1 hour, 59 minutes in Vienna,” Moses Opio, fitness trainer in Kisasi.<br/> <br/>“As you run, pay attention to your form; your whole body, no matter the distance you are running should move in perfect rhythm.”<br/> <br/>“Make sure your toes are pointed straight ahead. Your body should lean slightly forward from your hips and your arms should swing loosely straight forward and back and never from side to side,” Peter Cherukut, an athletics coach in Kapchorwa, says.<br/> <br/>“As you run, hold your head up and keep the back straight. That is a cardinal rule and I always share it with jogging friends.<br/>See when you look down as you run, you exert pressure on your knees. So avoid looking at your feet.”<br/> <br/>Cherukut says “Remember to also bend your elbows and hold your arms away from the body as you run. The foot should always land on the heel, not on the ball of the foot. Also wear loose, well-fitting and comfortable running shoes. Select a pair with firm soles and good arch support.”<br/> </p>
