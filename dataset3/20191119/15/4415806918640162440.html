      <p>Ireland has begun the biggest social house building programme in a generation, the Taoiseach said.</p>
      <p>Leo Varadkar claimed Fianna Fáil’s housing policies were “bankrupt”,  “empty” and lacked substance as he promised 10-11,000 new social properties for those who cannot afford their own accommodation.</p>
      <p>The country also needs to provide developments for private sale enabling people to buy homes near where they grew up, the Fine Gael leader added.</p>
      <p>He said: “I believe that public lands should be used for the benefit of all the public.</p>
      <p>“We also need private housing for people to buy.</p>
      <p>“People want to be able to buy a place near where they grew up.”</p>
      <p>Recently Mr Varadkar turned the sod at a €40m development in Cork, the first affordable purchase housing scheme in the country but said he was also aware of the wider challenges.</p>
      <p>He added: “This is the biggest social housing programme in a generation.”</p>
      <p>Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin told the Dáil the Government was blaming everybody but themselves for homelessness.</p>
      <p>He said: “People are suffering out there because of the lack of housing in this country.”</p>
      <p>He said parents agreed that their young people had no prospect of owning a home and warned homelessness was rising.</p>
      <p>He characterised the Government’s attitude as: “We will blame everybody else but ourselves.</p>
      <p>“That is your approach to housing and the other key issues facing this country.”</p>
      <p>Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has warned an agreement reached by a group of Dublin city councillors on regenerating O’Devaney Gardens in Dublin cannot be implemented due to funding and legal concerns.</p>
      <p>The Taoiseach said he hoped the council would get on with the mixed development as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>He added: “People need these houses.”</p>
      <p>The former apartment complex near Stoneybatter has been lying derelict since the foundering of a previous agreement to overhaul the area a decade ago.</p>
