      <p>Brazil were bidding to end their five-game streak without a win following on from their Copa America triumph in the summer, against South Korea in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a>, having regained his place ahead of Ederson in the defeat to Argentina last time out, retained his place in between the sticks and was this time joined by <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> from the off.</p>
      <p>Despite cementing himself as one of the best players in his position, the outing was <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a>‘s first appearance in Tite’s starting XI since October 2018, stepping into the side in place of Casemiro.</p>
      <p>The Selecao needn’t wait long to land the first blow, however, as Lucas Paqueta worked his way into the six-yard box and outmuscled his opponent to head in Renan Lodi’s cross with nine minutes on the clock.</p>

      <p>It was a lead which was doubled by ex-Red <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/philippe-coutinho/">Philippe Coutinho</a> after 35 minutes when <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/fabinho/">Fabinho</a> was impeded as he looked to drive inside the box, earning a free-kick to which the Brazilian curled into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>South Korea’s Heung-min Son was intent on testing <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/alisson/">Alisson</a> throughout, and while Liverpool’s No. 1 was comfortable more often than not, he did experience a slight scare when a dead ball strike on the edge of the area bounced off his chest with his follow up effort almost resulting in Coutinho turning the ball into his own net.</p>
      <p>A third would be added by Danillo after the break with a drilled effort from outside the area, and while South Korea would go on to mount some pressure to peg back the deficit, Brazil held firm.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/roberto-firmino/">Roberto Firmino</a>, meanwhile, was named among the substitutes in what would have been a welcome sight for the Reds as he has played a total of 1339 minutes of a possible 1740 for Liverpool so far this season, in addition to his international exploits.</p>
      <p>He would play out the final six minutes of the clash alongside his Liverpool counterparts.</p>
      <p>Unlike recent times where the Brazilian contingent have required a private plane for a swift return to Merseyside, they will return with time on their side as they now turn their attention to the trip to <a href="https://www.thisisanfield.com/liverpool-fc/crystal-palace">Crystal Palace</a> on Saturday.</p>
