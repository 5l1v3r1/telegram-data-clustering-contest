      <p>CHENNAI: Actors <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a> and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Kamal-Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a> have said they are ready to join hands politically "if the need arises", indicating that the scenario in <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Tamil-Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> is in for many twists and turns in the days ahead.</p>
      <p>"In the interests of the people, should circumstances prove conducive , Kamal and I will definitely unite," Rajinkanth told reporters at the Chennai airport on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>This came an hour after Haasan set the ball rolling by saying that he and Rajinikanth, whose politics has followed a different trajectory, could work together for the betterment of the state.</p>
      <p>"We have been friends for about 44 years. We will come together for the betterment of Tamil Nadu, if the need arises," Haasan had said.</p>
      <p>Their statements put to rest weeks of speculation about a possible partnership between the two celluloid stars in a political scenario which is in a fast churn post the death of towering leaders J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi.</p>
      <p>The political journeys of Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth have come under sharp focus of late.While the 68-year-old actor is rumoured to take the plunge in September next year, Haasan, who floated his Makkal Needhi Maiam last year, is presently taking advice from political strategist Prashant Kishor and going for a revamp to bolster internal democracy.</p>
      <p>Haasan and Rajinikanth have nurtured a celluloid rivalry that never spilled over into their real lives. The two Tamil stalwarts, who last appeared on the screen together in a film in 1981, have been seen together at events recently. Rajinikanth attended a function to unveil the bust of K Balachander, the late mentor of both of them, in the office of Haasan. He followed that up with a speech praising Haasan in glowing terms and vowing to keep the friendship alive even in the realm of politics at a function to celebrate Haasanâ€™s 60-year contribution to cinema.</p>
      <p>According to sources within Makkal Needhi Maiam, the idea of going to polls with Rajinikanth has been deliberated within the party for some time now. According to a source aware of the developments, political strategist Kishor too had suggested that they both tie up for polls.</p>
      <p>Others however point to their divergent ideological trajectories . Haasan is an atheist has held a fascination for leftist ideals, and Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was one of the first political leaders he met around the time he decided to enter politics. Rajinikanth is a believer - and an open admirer of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah - who has on many issues taken a stand different from Haasan. Both seemed headed for diametrically different directions till Rajini recently said nobody could "paint him saffron" ..</p>
      <p>Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu are scheduled to be held in 2021.</p>
