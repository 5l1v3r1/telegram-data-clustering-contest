      <h1>Australians will also be seeing Black Friday sales on the Google Store next week</h1>

      <p>Sometimes we get jealous of our friends in the US who see sales of Google devices consistently. This year though Australians will also be able to join in the fun on Black Friday as Google will be having some deals on their hardware.</p>
      <p>Although the deals are unknown at this stage the<a href="https://store.google.com/"> Google Store</a> has a big advertisement on their landing page advertising the sale starting next Friday, Black Friday. At this stage we have not seen any leaks with what exactly will be on sale and how much for but we expect it to be fairly similar to the deals on the US Google Store.</p>
      <p>The US Google store will apparently feature a cool US$200 off the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL and a $100 discount on the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL. The US store will also include sales on the Google Slate, Google Stadia, Nest Hub Max, Nest Hub, Nest Mini and Nest Wi-fi. Of course two of these arenâ€™t available here but we hope the sales extend to the other products here as well.</p>
      <p>If you are looking at buying a Pixel 4 or any other Google product it may be a good idea to hold off for now and see what Google Australia do with their pricing come Friday next week. If the Pixel 4 gets $300AU off here it brings it into a price range where we can definitely recommend a purchase.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more deals and sales as they come to hand.</p>
