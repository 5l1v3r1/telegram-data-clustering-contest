      <h1>‘Misty Copelands’ Are Rare in World of Ballet, and Black Entrepreneur Looks to Change That</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:42:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://atlantablackstar.com/author/laurenf/" target="_blank">Lauren Floyd</a></address>
      <p>When Robin Pitts, founder of the dance studio Dance Makers, started dancing at 7 years old she didn’t see many people on TV who looked like her.</p>
      <p>Her mother wasn’t even sure she’d like dance, after it didn’t take with her older sister.</p>
      <p>Still, the aspiring ballerina begged until her mother relented.</p>

      <p>More than 30 years later, she still hasn’t stopped dancing.</p>
      <p>“I’m a studio kid,” Pitts told Atlanta Black Star Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>She’s focusing more on the administrative side of dance these days, having founded the Maryland-based Dance Makers studio in 2001 and leading the organization into its 18th year.</p>
      <p>The company, a relatively small studio with about 400 students, competes against studios that sometimes have as many as 12,000 or 15,000 students.</p>
      <p>It’s attracted prominent instructors from noted choreographer and Julliard-trained dancer Roger Jeffrey to Caroline Rocher Barnes, who studied at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center before joining The Dance Theatre of Harlem.</p>

      <p>“In our community those parents who want technique, they come to us.” Pitts said.</p>
      <p>She started her company, which offers jazz, ballet and hip-hop, with a mission to introduce more technically trained Black ballerinas onto the dance scene.</p>
      <p>“When we go to dance competitions we’re the minority,” she said.</p>
      <p>It’s not uncommon to see Black band dancers or artists in other types of dance, but “you don’t see a lot of Misty Copelands,” she said.</p>
      <p>Copeland became the first Black woman to be promoted to principal dancer in the 75-year-history of American Ballet Theatre on June 30, 2015.</p>

      <p>“It’s important because I think we need to see brown people,” Pitts said. “I never saw that.”</p>
      <p>Ballet’s “precise focus of synchronization and uniformed visual blending including skin tone” has made it a difficult task for brown ballerinas to be as accepted and rise in premier ballet, according to a Dance Makers news release.</p>
      <p>“For years Brown ballerinas have been told that their skin tone disrupts the visual uniformity of performances,” the company said.  </p>
      <p>In her documentary “A Ballerina’s Tale,” Copeland and other Black ballerinas spoke about the struggles they faced fitting into a ballet culture in which their skin colors and bodies weren’t widely accepted. </p>

      <p>“I didn’t fit the mode,” Copeland said in the documentary. “Based on my body type, pedigree and background, I should not have been part of one of the greatest ballet companies.</p>
      <p>I don’t think the classic ballet will ever accept me, I’m Black, I have a large chest, and I’m muscular.”  </p>
      <p>Pitts said the lack of diversity in dance has also been a major obstacle for her company when it comes time to recruit new students.</p>
      <p>“We can go to competition and compete against one studio and beat them,” Pitts said, “and parents will go right over to them.”</p>
      <p>She said some organizations don’t even offer the same quality of instruction, but people are “more forgiving.”</p>
      <p>“And that bothers me,” Pitts said.</p>
      <p>Pitts said she wants to put her company on a larger platform and one day have her studio featured on a reality TV show, but her most immediate goals are preparing her students for the real world.</p>
      <p>Getting a college degree has to be part of that preparation because dance has a “very short lifespan,” Pitts said.</p>
      <p>“There’s no way for us to survive. We need our education in order to be a competitor,” the entrepreneur said. “We have to do everything three times as hard.”</p>
