      <p>South Korea has agreed to buy more than $100 million in annual US rice exports, US officials said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Under the agreement, South Korea will provide access for 132,304 tons of American-produced rice a year at an annual value of about $110 million, the US Trade Representative's office said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Exports are critical for the economic health of the US rice industry, with half our crop being exported every year," US Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in the statement.</p>
      <p>Following negotiations, Seoul has adopted tariff-rate import quotas for about 400,000 tons of rice from the United States, Australia, China and Thailand.</p>
      <p>According to the US Trade Representative's office, South Korea has allotted about a third of this to American growers, the highest volume of US access ever.</p>
      <p>Under the World Trade Organization, South Korea had enjoyed special treatment for rice market access until this expired in 2014, when negotiations started.</p>
      <p>The new agreement is to take effect in January.</p>
