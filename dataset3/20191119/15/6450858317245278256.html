      <p>We've teamed up with Honor to offer Tech Advisor readers the chance to win one of 15 <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3778116-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fwearable-tech%2Fwin-honor-band-5-3778116%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hihonor.com%2Fuk%2Fproduct%2Fhonor-band5">Honor Band 5</a> fitness trackers, just in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>One of our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/wearable-tech/best-fitness-tracker-3498368/">top 10 fitness trackers</a>, the Honor Band 5 is a good-looking activity band that doubles as a watch, offering you the time and basic notifications on its 0.95in AMOLED colour display.</p>
      <p>It can do a lot more than count your steps, with 10 workout modes available. Waterproof to 50m it's a useful device for swim-tracking - or simply taking in the shower - and there's a built-in heart-rate tracker for analysing your sleep. Honor Band 5 is also the only fitness tracker at its price point to include the ability to measure your blood oxygen level (SpO2).</p>
      <p>With a 100mAh battery inside it's incredibly lightweight at 22.7g, but should last up to two weeks on standby.</p>
