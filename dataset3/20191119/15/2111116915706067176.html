      <p>If you have an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/amazon-fire-tv-stick-1274525/review">Amazon Fire TV Stick</a> and an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-amazon-echo-speaker-the-lineups-dots-spots-shows-and-pluses-compared">Echo speaker</a> at home, you've probably worked out that you can control your content using your voice, thanks to Alexa's smarts. </p>
      <p>Until now though, you've never been able to control your actual hardware, like turning your TV on and off, for example – and that's where the new Amazon Fire TV Blaster comes in.</p>

      <p>This infrared companion device works alongside your existing Fire TV device and Echo speaker to extend Alexa's control, which means you can switch HDMI inputs on your TV, adjust your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-av-receiver-2017-which-home-cinema-av-receiver-should-you-buy">AV receiver</a>, change the volume on your <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/audio/home-cinema-audio/tr-top-10-best-soundbars-1288008">soundbar</a>, and even power your TV on and off, totally hands-free.</p>

      <h4>A Fire TV Cube alternative</h4>
      <p>Up for preorder now, the Amazon Fire TV Blaster will be available to buy from December 11 for $34.99 / £34.99 (around AU$50). If you preorder, you're also eligible to order a bundle consisting of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k">Fire TV Stick 4K</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/audio-systems/amazon-echo-dot-1328595/review">Echo Dot (3rd Gen)</a> and Fire TV Blaster for $79.99 / £86.98, which is a pretty substantial saving.</p>
      <p>The new Fire TV Blaster doesn't work on it's own; you'll need a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/av-accessories/amazon-fire-tv-stick-1274525/review">Fire TV Stick</a>, Fire TV Stick 4K or Fire TV (3rd Gen), as well as an Echo speaker to be able to give Alexa voice commands to control your home cinema setup. </p>
      <p>If you already have these devices at home, the Fire TV Blaster represents a cheaper alternative to the $119 / £109.99 (around AU$175) <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/amazon-fire-tv-cube">Fire TV Cube</a>, which also works with Alexa, to control the device (plus your soundbar, TVs, AV receiver and cable or satellite box) with your voice.</p>
