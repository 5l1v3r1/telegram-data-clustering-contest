      <p>The death occurred on Monday of retired Navan garage proprietor, Jack Tobin, of Bridge Street.</p>
      <p>His son, Meath West TD, Peadar Toibin, announced his passing on his Facebook page today (Tuesday). He said: “My Da, Jack Tobin died yesterday. He was a son of Navan, born 1931 when everyone knew everyone. He was third youngest of ten children and grew up during tough times of World War II when there wasn’t a lot to go around.<br/>“He served his time in his father’s garage which was one of the first garages in Meath. It was said of him that he could put legs on a spider as he could engineer a solution out of nothing. People came far and wide to him especially with vintage cars. He worked hard, often working <br/>seven days a week to raise his family.<br/>“He was an early member of the Navan Silver Band and last year he celebrated the 70th anniversary of his trip to France in 1948. He often told us of the destruction still apparent the towns that they visited. He loved music and played the trumpet in combos here and in Canada when he was young. In the late 1950s he worked in the uranium mines in Canada, inside the frozen Artic Circle. This gave him a lifetime worth of stories to regale his seven children.<br/>“He was a character who loved the craic. We was a raconteur that could tell a great story and had rebellious spirit. He loved a western, poker, good company and a dropín now and again. He loved tennis, even rolling and marking out a court for us as kids on our back lawn. He was wise and bright and lived 88 good years. <br/>"He will be sorely missed by my mother Margaret, his seven kids, 16 grandchildren and one surviving sister.”</p>
