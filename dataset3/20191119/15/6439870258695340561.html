      <p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (WBTV) - A UNC Charlotte student was assaulted and robbed outside the university’s library early Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>“In the early morning hours we received a Live Safe tip that said help," explained Chief of UNCC Campus Police, Jeffrey Baker.</p>
      <p>“We were able to track that Live safe tip to our Library.”</p>
      <p>School officials say the student’s cellphone was taken during the assault. Police and public safety were immediately alerted of the incident through the school’s <a href="https://emergency.uncc.edu/communications/communications/livesafe">LiveSafe app</a>, which uses GPS location sharing technology and includes a tap-of-the-button way to access emergency services.</p>

      <p>The suspects were arrested as they exited the back enterance of the Atkins Library, officials say, and charged with common law robbery.</p>
      <p>A student nearby contacted emergency services through the app.</p>
      <p>Baker says thanks to the student’s quick thinking of using the Live Safe App, police were able to get there so quickly.</p>
