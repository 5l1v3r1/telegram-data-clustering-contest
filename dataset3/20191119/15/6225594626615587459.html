        <b>As part of Facebook’s effort to appeal to younger users, one of the company’s “secret” project groups has launched a new meme-making app called Whale.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://wersm.com/category/facebook">Facebook</a> is far from giving up on younger demographics; that’s become abundantly clear. It wants to become cool with young users in some way, and is constantly trying new things – whether that’s <a href="https://wersm.com/facebook-pulled-the-plug-on-lol-its-teen-meme-project/">launching new apps</a> every few months or so, or testing new features in its flagship app, <a href="https://wersm.com/instagram-launches-reels-a-tiktok-clone/">Instagram</a>, WhatsApp, or Messenger.</p>
      <p>One of those apps above is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">Whale</a>, a new Meme Creator app from a group within Facebook called NPE Team LLC. NPE stands for New Product Experimentation, by the way.</p>
      <p>Whale appeared last week, and, for the time being, is only available on the Canadian <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">Apple App Store</a>. Its description reads, “No distractions, no hidden subscription pricing. Use your own images or choose from our stock photo library and get creative with text, tools, effects, and more right inside the app.”</p>
      <p>Users simply pick a photo (snap one, choose from their camera roll, or use one from the app’s stock image library) and use it to make a meme with text, images, emojis, filters, and more. The resulting meme-creation can then be saved and shared on social media or directly in conversations from the app.</p>

      <p>It doesn’t get more complicated than this, with users being able to choose between blank, 2-grid, 3-grid, and 4-grid canvas layouts, use a freeform draw tool or create image stickers with included tools.</p>
      <p>The group behind Whale previously released two other apps, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/bump-by-facebook">Bump</a> and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/aux-by-facebook">Aux</a>, both of which also target younger users. According to a <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/12ecc6">recent report</a> from The Information, neither of these apps have actually gained much traction. Also, a Facebook spokesperson explained that the apps from NPE Team “could be shut down quickly and are intended to help the company find new features and services that people like.”</p>
      <p>Not a surprise if you ask me.</p>
