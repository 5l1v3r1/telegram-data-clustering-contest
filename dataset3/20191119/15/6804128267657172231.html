      <h1>The Spurs away record West Ham want to extend to heap misery on Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>The Hammers are in their own blip in form but Spurs have been dreadful on the road in 2019</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Inkersole</a></address>
      <p>West Ham will be hoping to pile the pressure on Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino by extending Spurs' winless away win record in the league into a <b>tenth</b> month when the two face off at London Stadium on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has not seen his side win a game on their travels since January 20 of this year which was a 2-1 win over Fulham, who would go on to be relegated, at Craven Cottage. The visitors to Craven Cottage came from behind after Fernando Llorente's own goal to win thanks to strikes from Dele Alli and Christian Eriksen.</p>
      <p>When a team is usually in a dire run of form, the Hammers invariably help them out and it's become a bit of a meme on social media. Just this season, Burnley had lost three games in a row before they played West Ham and proceeded to soundly beat the visitors to Turf Moor 3-0 before the international break.</p>
      <p>Spurs boss Pochettino is under big pressure to turn the ship around in north London having seen his side go backwards since reaching the Champions League final six months again. So is his counterpart in the opposite dugout Manuel Pellegrini who has seen West Ham win since September 22 - six games ago.</p>
      <p>But it seems the Spurs boss is under more immediate danger of getting the boot than his fellow South American across town, with some reports saying this weekend could be win or bust for Pochettino.</p>
      <p>His away record since January makes for grim reading, as you can see below:</p>

      <p>Pochettino's side have had some tough fixtures in their road trips, playing Man City and Liverpool twice but have also been beaten at Burnley, Bournemouth and Brighton - maybe they have trouble with teams beginning with the letter B.</p>
      <p>Saturday's meeting brings together two under-fire South American managers, two teams who have lost their first choice goalkeeper to injury, two teams who have won three games each this season and two teams who are two places apart in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Defeat for either would see the biggest stick used to beat them. Vice versa, a win for either could be the start of a revival and climbing up the very congested Premier League table.</p>
