      <p>BENGALURU: The top 200 Chinese companies spanning consumer, technology, industrial, property and financial industries reported September quarter earnings well ahead of market expectations, setting them up for a strong showing next year, analysts said.</p>
      <p>These companies mostly beat lowered market expectations as consumer spending remained strong, boosted by Chinese shoppers who opted to buy at home than to travel abroad, as a weaker yuan inflated travel costs.</p>
      <p>Profits at Chinese companies grew 10% in the July-September period, beating the 2% growth rate analysts had predicted, and ahead of China's slowing economic growth rate. Only companies with a market capitalization of over $1 billion and tracked by at least three analysts are covered in this analysis.</p>
      <p>"The sectors that were expected to suffer from the U.S.-China trade conflict — the tech hardware exporters, textiles and sports goods exporters — have largely outperformed consensus expectations," said Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Asia Pacific.</p>
      <p>Raychaudhuri added that earnings growth at Asian companies, excluding Japan, is likely to bounce back in 2020, partly as trade concerns recede.</p>
      <p>Below is a report card of the third quarter for Asian companies and expectations for next year.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Online retail giants <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Alibaba-Group">Alibaba Group</a> Holding Ltd and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/JD.com">JD.com</a> Inc posted strong sales as people bought baby products and sports gear. Western luxury and mass-market consumer companies had a good quarter as well.</p>
      <p>** Overall, profitability at 1,625 Asian firms fell 5%, versus an expected 6% decline, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. Results outperformed estimates for the first time in five quarters.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Hong Kong-listed firms are not included in this analysis, as most of them announce earnings results on a semi-annual basis.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Profits at 346 South Korean firms nearly halved, dragged down by lower chip prices and a fluctuation in commodity prices.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Profit at <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Samsung">Samsung</a> Electronics Co Ltd fell 56%. Smaller rival SK Hynix Inc posted its lowest profit in three years. Steelmaker Posco's earnings plunged by a third as iron ore prices rose.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Profits at 201 Indian firms rose 29.5%, led by consumer staples, financial and healthcare firms and helped by a corporate tax cut.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Profits at 673 Japanese firms which exclude <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/SoftBank-Group">SoftBank Group</a> Corp, fell 1%, in line with estimates, as the yen firmed and demand fell for export items such as cars and machinery.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; The top three Japanese steelmakers and carmakers Suzuki Motor Corp and <a href="http://www.zigwheels.com/newcars/Mitsubishi">Mitsubishi</a> Motors Corp have reduced their annual profit forecasts.</p>
      <p>&gt;&gt; Analysts expect profits at Asian firms to jump 13% in 2020, versus a 5% estimated increase this year, helped partly by recovering global demand as trade worries ease further.</p>
