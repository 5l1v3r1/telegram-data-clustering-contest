      <p>“The BJP workers spread lies to score political mileage, while Congress workers hesitate to even tell the truth about the party’s achievements,” Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah said here on Tuesday. He was addressing party workers at a programme organised to mark the 103rd birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who contested from Chikkamagaluru to Parliament in the 1970s.</p>
      <p>He appealed to Congress workers to tell the people about the good deeds of the party. “The youths of the country have no jobs, yet they praise Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The IT field has also suffered an economic slowdown. The youths should be told about these developments”, he said.</p>
      <p>Recalling the contributions of Indira Gandhi to the country, Mr. Siddaramaiah said Mr. Narendra Modi had been praised for Balakot strikes. But, Indira Gandhi led the country in the 1971 war against Pakistan successfully and that led to the creation of Bangladesh. “BJP leader Atal Behari Vajpayee himself called Indira Gandhi as ‘Durgi’. But, BJP people of the day do not understand all these things. They are engaged in rewriting history for their convenience”, he said.</p>
      <p>KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao said “the BJP people had been trained by the RSS to spread lies.” He accused the BJP of raking up emotional issues for political gains.</p>
      <p>Former Minister D.K.Shivakumar said Indira Gandhi fought for strengthening the country’s secular fabric.</p>
      <p>Dr. Amshumanth, newly appointed president of the party’s district unit, took charge in the presence of senior leaders. Former president D.L.Vijaykumar handed over the charge.</p>
      <p>Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council S.R. Patil, AICC secretary Vishnunath, and former Minister U.T. Khader were present.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, party workers took out a procession in the city.</p>
      <p>A section of workers picked up an argument with party leaders alleging that photos of Muslim leaders of the party were not carried in the banners and posters of the programme.</p>
