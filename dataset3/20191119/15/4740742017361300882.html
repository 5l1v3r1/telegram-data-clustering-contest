      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:43:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:43</time> by <a rel="author">Adam Postans</a></address>
      <p>Marvin Rees has been criticised for launching a “truly shocking” attack on democracy in Bristol.</p>
      <p>The city’s mayor blamed inaction over major decisions on “political shenanigans” in the council chamber and accused councillors of playing “ping-pong” with issues.</p>
      <p>His comments, during a debate at full council on the proposed multi-million pound revamp of Cumberland Basin, have alarmed opposition leaders.</p>
      <p>Explaining the creation of two unelected advisory groups which will progress <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/controversial-western-harbour-plans-branded-3540506">the plans for the area rebranded as Western Harbour</a>, Mr Rees slammed members’ right to debate controversial topics on behalf of the residents they represent as counter-productive.</p>
      <p>He told them: “One of the death-knells of getting things done in Bristol is to begin to get people on these benches to play ping-pong with it.”</p>
      <p>The leaders of the three city council opposition parties have blasted the Labour mayor’s statements, accusing him of “attacking democracy”, “losing contact with reality” and being unable to take criticism.</p>
      <p>Rounding off the Western Harbour debate at the full council meeting on November 12, Mr Rees said: "Historically this organisation has failed to meet the challenges of the city because of political shenanigans.</p>
      <p>“They have not made decisions, they haven’t delivered homes or transport solutions and we are dealing with the legacy of that today.”</p>
      <p>He said he was taking <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/western-harbour-cumberland-basin-plans-3503352">the Western Harbour advisory groups</a> “out of politics”.</p>
      <p>One of the working groups will include local people, residents’ groups and businesses, set up to “influence early plans” for the area.</p>
      <p>Alongside that will be a “reference group” comprising “individuals and organisations that enables local groups and the community to be engaged and informed about what is happening and how to participate with the proposed scheme development”.</p>
      <p>The mayor told full council: “We set up that group to be non-political.</p>
      <p>“I’m not on it. No cabinet member is on it.</p>
      <p>“We give it to the city, we give it to experts in the city and they take the long view outside the electoral cycle and any campaign leaflet material you might like to generate and they guide the city forward.</p>
      <p>“Their responsibility is to consult with stakeholder groups — local residents, businesses and us.</p>
      <p>“An independent chair will oversee that process, so we’re taking it out of politics."</p>
      <h3>'An attack on the democratic process'</h3>
      <p>After the meeting, Lib Dem group leader Gary Hopkins said: “It is a symptom of the mayoral system that the further they get up and up the ivory tower, they lose contact with reality and see anyone who doesn’t agree with them 100 per cent as an enemy.</p>
      <p>“He actually uses the public disquiet with politicians, which undoubtedly has grown over the past two or three years because of what’s been going on in Parliament, to prevent scrutiny,  and sees people asking relevant questions as acting irresponsibly.</p>
      <p>“It is an attack on the democratic process.</p>
      <p>“The majority of Bristol’s public are well-informed and do not like what they’re hearing and seeing.</p>
      <p>“The mayor trying to pull the wool over their eyes on everything is not a good way to proceed.</p>
      <p>“Clearly the mayoral system has got to go.</p>
      <p>“In the meantime we will be trying every means possible to uphold the democractic process and raise issues so the public can actually see what is going on and get involved.</p>
      <p>“But the mayor has bent the constitution, he’s got all the power on his side and it’s quite difficult to do that now.”</p>
      <p>Conservative group leader Cllr Mark Weston, who is also the Tories’ Bristol North West general election candidate, said:  “It is true that there was a perception over the years that Bristol had gained a reputation – not entirely justified – for not getting things done.</p>
      <p>“However, I was disappointed to hear – again – the mayor’s ‘stock’ disparaging excuse for excluding political opponents from engaging in decision-making processes.</p>
      <p>“While the mayor has identified some of the major challenges facing us, I believe it is a mistake to try to bypass members, some of whom have considerable experience and expertise on issues like housing, climate change, planning and the local economy.</p>
      <p>“I fear there is something intrinsic to the role of city mayor, which we have seen in both the incumbent and his predecessor, whereby they start off well with the best intentions but increasingly become averse to criticism.”</p>
      <p>Cllr Weston added the Western Harbour advisory groups risked becoming “totally toothless bodies without the kind of democratic oversight necessary to challenge or shape the final design of this scheme”.</p>
      <p>Green group leader Cllr Eleanor Combley said Mr Rees’s said: “I was really concerned by the mayor’s comments. </p>
      <p>“Making decisions democratically isn’t always easy. It requires hard work and compromise.</p>
      <p>“You need to listen to people who don’t agree with you and take their views into account.</p>
      <p>“It may be something the mayor doesn’t like to do but it leads to better decisions and a better chance of meeting everyone’s needs and gaining everyone’s support.</p>
      <p>“A commitment to making democracy work is an important part of my politics.</p>
      <p>“Mayor Rees seemed to be suggesting that instead we should give up on democracy and just let his friends in business make all the decisions.</p>
      <p>“To hear that from the man who is supposed to represent and stand up for the people of Bristol was truly shocking.”</p>
      <p>It is not the first time the mayor’s unelected advisory groups have come under fire amid claims of “secrecy”.</p>
      <p>Two of the One City Plan boards, hold public meetings and include councillors, but members are not allowed to attend meetings of three of the other boards.</p>
      <p>The learning city partnership and Bristol transport board meet behind closed doors, as does the newly created environmental sustainability board.</p>
      <p>A sixth board in the pipeline, an economy board, is not expected to be open to the press or public either.</p>
      <p>Critics fear a lack of transparency.</p>
