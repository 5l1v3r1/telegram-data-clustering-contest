      <p>Amazon Prime video’s latest show ‘<i>One Mic Stand</i>‘ featuring five celebrities and stand-up comedians is already creating an uproar amongst the fans with the never before seen comical acts. After politician Dr Shashi Tharoor and Youtube sensation Bhuvan Bam, Singer-composer Vishal Dadlani shares his experience on being the part of the show.</p>
      <p>Vishal Dadlani shares, “I have been a performer doing live-gigs for a very long time now. It all started with my Pentagram days. Doing a live Stand-Up comedy, I felt that it would be easy considering the large audiences I have performed to. Turns out, it’s nerve-racking, but also hugely rewarding. There is nothing quite like the joy you experience when your first joke lands and the audience cracks up. This whole thing was an incredible experience. I’m actually curious to know what audiences think of my set!.”</p>
