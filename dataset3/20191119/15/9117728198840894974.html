Fans and pundits have largely blamed Vettel for the incident but the stewards decided that it was a racing incident.

      <p><i>“I had a better run out of the chicane, tried to pass, and then we touched,”</i> Vettel added.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that relationships at Ferrari are under tension after the team continued to back Vettel as their number one driver despite Leclerc's performances. This incident is not what Ferrari would have wanted. </p>

        <i>“I was aware he was on the outside, I left a little space but enough for him. And then I think he tried to squeeze me a little bit towards the inside. And we were very close so we touched straightaway and I had a puncture.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>There was minimal contact and they were very unlucky to have so much damage to their cars after such a small collision. </p>
