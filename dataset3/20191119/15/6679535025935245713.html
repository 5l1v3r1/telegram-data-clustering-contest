      <p>A court here has awarded life imprisonment to 4 members of a family in a murder case.</p>
      <p>According to prosecution, Sekar, 33, of Kamarajar Street in Azhagiyapandiapuram under Maanur police station limits, married Mahalakshmi of the same area in 2013. The family of the bride had given 10 sovereigns of gold ornaments and other household articles as dowry at the time of marriage.</p>
      <p>However, Sekar and his family members tortured Mahalakshmi demanding more dowry. At one point, Mahalakshmi left her husband to live with the family of his brother Ramakrishnan, 35, living in the same area.</p>
      <p>As this incident created enmity between Sekar and Ramakrishnan, Sekar, his father Ilaiyaraja, 57, brothers Periya Mariappan, 40 and Chinna Mariappan, 39, murdered Ramakrishnan even as he was standing in the Azhagiyapandiapuram bus stand on October 30, 2015. The police arrested all the four.</p>
      <p>Fourth Additional Sessions Judge Vijayakanth awarded life imprisonment to Sekar, his father and brothers and imposed a fine of â‚¹ 5,500 each on Tuesday.</p>
