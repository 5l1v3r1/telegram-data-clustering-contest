      <h1>Alexander Vindman invokes late dad, defends colleagues during impeachment hearing</h1>

      <p>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman,  a U.S. Army officer detailed to the National Security Council who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/29/alexander-vindmans-firsthand-account-of-ukraine-call-i-didnt-think-it-was-proper/">listened in on the July 25 call</a> at the center of the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-day-3-of-public-testimony/">impeachment inquiry against President Trump</a>, spoke to Capitol Hill lawmakers of his own patriotism, of his late father who brought his family to the U.S. from Ukraine and defended his colleagues who have also testified.</p>
      <p>The 20-year military officer arrived at Capitol Hill in military blue with a chest full of service medals. He said he is grateful his father came to the United States, a place “where I can live free of fear for mine and my family’s safety.”</p>
      <p>He then spoke to his late father in his opening statement before the House Intelligence Committee, saying, “Dad, my sitting here today … is proof that you made the right decision 40 years ago to leave the Soviet Union.”</p>

      <p>And he defended fellow State Department and White House officials who have offered testimony or will be testifying against character attacks. “I want to take a moment to recognize the courage of my colleagues who have appeared and are scheduled to appear before this Committee. I want to state that the vile character attacks on these distinguished and honorable public servants is reprehensible,” Vindman said.</p>
      <p>“It is natural to disagree and engage in spirited debate, this has been our custom since the time of our Founding Fathers, but we are better than callow and cowardly attacks.”</p>
