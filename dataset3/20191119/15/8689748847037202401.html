      <p>Veteran Ghanaian actor David Kwame Dontoh has expressed his fears of Ghana going through another colonization if proper structures are not put in place to help with our cultural system.</p>
      <p>Speaking to AJ Sarpong on Citi TV’s Hall of Fame, David Dontoh disclosed that, the rate at which Ghanaians are easily adapting to the foreign cultures, we may end up losing our  values passed down to us by our forefathers .</p>

      <p>“If we do not take care, by 2050 this country could be recolonised. if we do not change the direction we’re going as to what to do with our culture, with our language, with our everything, 20, 25 to 30 years to come this country would be recolonized,” David Dontoh stated.</p>
      <p>“Because we love not for Ghanaian culture, we live not for Ghanaian ethics, we live not with Ghanaian norms, we live not for anything Ghanaian but we call ourselves Ghanaians,” he added.</p>
      <p>David Dontoh further lamented that the upcoming year of return will only make things worse as Ghanaians are vulnerable to foreign culture as we tend to copy blindly from the Westerners.</p>
      <p>“Now that because of Year of Return, African Americans are coming and a lot of them are coming to settle and a lot of things like that it’s even going to get worse because we have been trained to easily fall for anything foreign and that’s where the danger lies,” he added.</p>
      <p>David Dontoh added that there are lots of people who claim to be Ghanaians but cannot speak any local dialect which is very bad.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of Ghanaian young men and women today who have Ghanaian names, claim they’re Ghanaians don’t know anything about a Ghana. Cannot even speak the language and that is dangerous. Very dangerous,” he remonstrated.</p>
      <p>David Dontoh, however, intimated that the situation could be saved if critical steps are taken towards prioritising the Ghanaian culture over the others.</p>
      <p>“I believe maybe if some people after those of us are gone who’ll come up and have interest in helping this country really take a critical look at these things maybe it’d change but if not,” he noted.</p>
      <p>David Dontoh was known for his “Agoro”game show and featured in several Akan Drama television series which gained prominence in the 1990s.</p>
