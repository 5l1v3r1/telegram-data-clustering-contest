      <h1>Insider testing for Halo: Combat Evolved will start after the holidays</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:35:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:35</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>343 Industries will start testing Halo: Combat Evolved for Halo: The Master Chief Collection PC sometime after the holidays.</p>
      <p>This is according to community director Brian Jarrard when asked about Insider testing for <b>Halo: Combat Evolved</b>.</p>
      <p>A PC version of Halo: Combat Evolved is already available, but this is the Anniversary edition which released for Xbox consoles.</p>
      <p>With Halo: Reach finally in the bag, one would think it would be smooth sailing for Combat Evolved, but Jarrard said bringing an upgraded version of the game to PC has been more “challenging” than the team initially thought.</p>
      <p>“We’re taking a game that’s very old, and we’re trying to update it for this platform – making it run at 60 fps, 4K – but also trying to account for all the requirements that PC gamers expect nowadays,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection/halo-ce-pc">Jarrad told PCgamesN</a>.</p>
      <p>“That’s things like uncapped frame rates, an FOV slider, and support for different aspect ratios.”</p>

      <p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection is available for pre-order on Steam and the Microsoft Store. Like Halo: Reach, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/14/halo-reach-coming-to-halo-the-master-chief-collection-december-3/">which arrives in December</a>, you will be able to purchase each game individually if you prefer. If you are an Xbox Game Pass user on PC, you will be able to download it at launch.</p>
      <p>All six titles in Halo: The Master Chief Collection can be purchased up-front on PC for $39.99 with the others available for $9.99 each.</p>
