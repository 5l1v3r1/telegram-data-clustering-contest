      <p>Mario Balotelli had a bad boy reputation at Manchester City - and it turns out he shelled out around £100,000-a-season in fines during his time at the Etihad.</p>
      <p>Balotelli's former teammate Micah Richards has revealed all about the fine system at City during their famous maiden Premier League title winning season.</p>
      <p>Defender Richards was in charge of collecting the fines, which come from being late, messy or generally anti-social, from inside the dressing room - with the funds being handed to charity.</p>
      <p>"Everything else seems to be within sync. Balotelli was always late," Richards said on the <a href="https://twitter.com/5liveSport/status/1196570932107718657">BBC.</a></p>

      <p>"We used to give all of our money to charities and by Christmas time we'd have £100,000 or £150,000 in there all from Balotelli being late. </p>
      <p>"He would be in the building. Say we had a meeting upstairs - he'd be downstairs just relaxing. He'd come to the meeting but he was just a bit dozy."</p>
      <p>Richards was at City from 2001 and 2015 before moving to Aston Villa. He has not had a club since the end of last season.</p>
      <p>The 13-cap England ace went on to joke about club legend Vincent Kompany and his diligent ways in keeping track of the fines and sticking to the letter of the law.</p>
      <p>"Kompany, he's busy isn't he?," Richards continued. "He just looks like that person anyway. He always kept a track of the fines and because I was sort of vice-captain, one of the leaders in the dressing room, he'd ask me to take charge of it. </p>
      <p>"But I wasn't going to say to the manager 'Oh player was late today, oh player didn't put his bib in the washing machine'.</p>
      <p>"So it was only if Vincent Kompany caught you. I'm not a snitch.</p>
      <p>"You could appeal it as well. You had to go with Vincent Kompany into the manager's office. He had a fine sheet logged of all the fines. He's like a schoolteacher, headmaster. One of those guys that when you see him, you turn the other way.</p>
      <p>"I tried to be friends with everyone. I told (Balotelli), "I'm going to let you off today". With him it was every other week so I could only do so much. </p>
      <p>"Kompany is looking over my shoulder making sure I was doing my job right. He undermined me a little bit, Kompany did'.</p>
