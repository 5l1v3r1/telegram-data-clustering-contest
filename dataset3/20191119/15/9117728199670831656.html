      <h1>Brundle: Verstappen "can be impossible to beat" with "right mindset"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:07:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:07</time> by <a rel="author">Nicolás Quarles van Ufford</a></address>

        <b>In his post-race column after the Brazilian Grand Prix, <i>Sky Sports F1 </i>pundit and former Formula 1 driver Martin Brundle has stated <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a> can be <i>"impossible to beat" </i>in races when given <i>"the right tools" </i>to do so.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dutchman took the checkered flag for the eighth time in his career, driving a dominant race after securing pole position on Saturday. He lost the lead after the first Safety Car, diving into the pitlane while <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> stayed out. </p>
      <p>Verstappen made quick work of retaking the lead, however, going around the outside of turn 1 on his fresh rubber, never looking back after.</p>

      <p>Brundle was in awe of the 22-year-old, but also the way his team was able to put him in position to have the race he had.</p>
      <p><i>"Nothing seemed to faze them,"</i> the Brit wrote about <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a>.</p>

        <i>"The start, tyre management and strategy, super-fast pit stops just at the right moment, retaking Hamilton for the lead, and the safety car restarts. When Max has the right tools and mindset he can be impossible to beat. Something I normally say about Lewis, and it was great to see the pair of them in true combat."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Verstappen passed Hamilton twice during the race after each of his pit stops, with the Brit just not able to match the Red Bull's pace. Hamilton ended up finishing third but got demoted to seventh after a five-second penalty.</p>
