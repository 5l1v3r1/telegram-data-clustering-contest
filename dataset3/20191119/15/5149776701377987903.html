      <h1>'We have to address it straight away' - Connell Rawlinson eager to end this Notts County concern</h1>
      <h2>Defender admits defeat to Barrow reminded Magpies they are not invincible</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:51:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:51</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Connell Rawlinson hopes defeat to Barrow will kickstart another impressive run for Notts County after admitting it was a reminder they are not “invincible”.</p>
      <p>The Magpies were beaten 3-0 by the Bluebirds who moved top of the National League following their victory at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a> at the weekend which was Notts’ first defeat at home since August.</p>
      <p>Rawlinson admitted that <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Notts</a> had let down their supporters with the performance, but while the result was considered a major disappointment they are still only six points adrift of the summit.</p>
      <p>And former Port Vale defender Rawlinson is eager for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/neal-ardley">Neal Ardley’s</a> side not to erase the game from the memory bank, believing it could serve as inspiration for the rest of the season.</p>
      <p>“It was very disappointing for the lads,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We let the fans down with the result and it was one of those days where we didn’t turn up as a team.</p>
      <p>“All over the pitch we were not good enough and we aren’t going to hide behind it.</p>
      <p>“We were beaten by the better team.</p>
      <p>“It was a day not to forget and we need to learn and learn fast.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully it will give us motivation, a kick up the backside and remind us that we aren’t invincible.</p>
      <p>“We are going to have to work hard to win the league. We will have to get back to the drawing board and go again.”</p>

      <p>Notts have a decent record at bouncing back from defeats this season and have the ideal chance to issue another fine response when they travel to struggling Aldershot at the weekend.</p>
      <p>But the task has been made tougher as the Shots were beaten 6-1 by Dagenham with their manager Damien Searle criticising their performance as a “disgrace”.</p>
      <p>Notts’ cause would certainly be helped if they could stop conceding early goals as they have let in four in the opening 15 minutes in the last three games.</p>
      <p>Rawlinson is eager to put a stop to that record and go back to the mean streak which had previously seen them boast the best defensive record in the division.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got to address that straight away because we can’t rely on scoring two goals to win a game,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You concede an early goal and you’ve got to score two to win it.</p>
      <p>“It is something we need to look at. Are we not pressing hard enough? Are we not starting fast enough? Are we letting them have too much of the ball early on to create chances?</p>
      <p>“I don’t know. It’s something we need to look at on the videos because as a defender we are just leaking far too many goals for my liking at the minute.”</p>
