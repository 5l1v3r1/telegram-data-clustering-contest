      <h1>Police issue update on latex clad gimp terrorising sleepy village</h1>
      <h2>The latex clad gimp has not been seen in the village of Claverham since the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:05:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:05</time> by <a rel="author">Heather Pickstock</a></address>
      <p>Two men arrested in connection with incidents of a masked gimp terrorising a sleepy <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/north-somerset">North Somerset</a> village have been released without charge.</p>
      <p>Terrified locals in Claverham in Somerset spent the summer in fear after reports that a man clad in a black bodysuit and head mask was approaching people late at night.</p>
      <p>Residents spoke of being scared to walk home alone with the latex clad pest on the loose with various stories emerging about freakish encounters.</p>
      <p>Some then speculated the area had been plagued by the 'gimp' for years - with police revealing they had already received numerous reports about the odd behaviour.</p>

      <p>A police search got underway using helicopters and sniffer dogs and an investigation launched which resulted in two men being arrested on suspicion of indecency offences.</p>
      <p>The last reported sighting of the gimp was in July this year.</p>
      <p>But whoever is behind the incidents has laid quiet ever since.</p>
      <p>Police have now confirmed the two men have been released without charge - and say there have been no further gimp-related incidents.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/avon-and-somerset-constabulary">Avon and Somerset Police</a> said: “Detectives carried out a thorough investigation into a series of incidents in which a man wearing disguises approached people in the Claverham/Yatton area.</p>
      <p>“Two men, aged 28 and 34, were arrested on suspicion of indecency offences but due to insufficient evidence were later released with no further action taken against them.</p>

      <p>“Thankfully, we’ve not received any more reports of similar incidents since the most recent report of a man wearing a black body suit approaching a woman on 11 July."</p>
      <p>Speaking after an incident in July, one victim said she was afraid to go out following her brush with the leather-suited man.</p>
      <p>She told the BBC: "Everything was running through my head. I thought: 'This is it, I'm going to get attacked'.</p>
      <p>She added that she had been left feeling "panicked" by the ordeal, which saw her confronted down a dark lane.</p>
      <p>She said: "It's not just a man jumping out at me going boo. Every time I close my eyes I just see that face."</p>
