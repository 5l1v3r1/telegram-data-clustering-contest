      <p>Philip Rivers knows he must cut out the turnovers that are"hurting" the Chargers, who <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/chiefs-chargers-live-score-updates-highlights-monday-night-football/muwihrmfnksuz7qklgx8w0wg">lost to the Chiefs 24-17</a> on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The Los Angeles quarterback threw his fourth interception of the game with 24 seconds remaining when he tried to find running back Austin Ekelerin the end zone. That late underthrow summed up another disappointing evening for Rivers and left the Chargers at 4-7.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old has hurled 14 interceptions this season — with 16 turnovers in total. Chargers coachAnthony Lynn saidRivers should not take full responsibility for his tally of turnovers, but the QB must raise his game.</p>
      <p>"Philip just has to execute better, as far as turnovers,"Lynn said. "Now, when you look at his turnovers, it's not always on the quarterback. I mean, sometimes the quarterback is getting hit late, or sometimes a receiver may slip down, so you can't put all of those turnovers on Philip.</p>
      <p>"But his turnovers are a little higher than I would like. He knows that. And we have to get better in that area —period."</p>
      <p>For his part, Rivers isaware the turnovers arenot acceptable.</p>
      <p>"It's a football game,"the veteransaid. "If you could just pick and choose and never throw them ever, I'd choose to throw zero.</p>
      <p>"So I certainly don't want to throw them, but I know it's hurting us right now. So obviously I need to cut them out."</p>
