      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:19:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:19</time> by <a rel="author">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/airdrie-and-coatbridge-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A near-naked man high on drink and drugs and armed with knives and scissors burst into a Coatbridge house and “engaged in sexual activity” towards a terrified 13-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>Perverted Michael McPhee, 27, was wearing only a pair of underpants when he committed the sordid offences on June 22.</p>
      <p>Last week at Airdrie Sheriff Court, McPhee pled guilty to a series of sex charges involving the young boy and a woman.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Jamie Dunbar told the court that McPhee intentionally engaged in a sexual activity in the presence of the teenager by exposing his private parts to the youngster.</p>
      <p>He also behaved in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause fear or alarm by entering the house uninvited wearing just his underwear.</p>
      <p>The court then heard he approached the young boy while in possession of two knives and a pair of scissors, followed him and demanded he approached him while exposing himself in front of the child.</p>
      <p>McPhee, whose address was given as a prisoner of HM Prison Addiewell, then intentionally exposed his private parts in front of a woman in the same street.</p>
      <p>At the time, McPhee was on bail from Airdrie Sheriff Court, an order imposed on him on May 20.</p>
      <p>Sentence had previously been deferred on McPhee for the court to obtain a risk assessment relating to the risk he posed to children and the general public.</p>

      <p>Defence lawyer Paul Belardo said: “He has been assessed as low risk in what were a bizarre set of circumstances in this case.</p>
      <p>“He had spent the evening consuming a large quantity of alcohol and had taken Valium tablets – he has a vague recollection of these offences.</p>
      <p>“He was making his way home and does not remember being in the house of the boy concerned.</p>
      <p>“He realises the seriousness of the incident and has done from the outset. He regrets what has happened and has expressed his remorse. He was adamant he did not want the young boy having to come to court to recall the events.</p>
      <p>“He was also aware of the consequences for his family members. When this happened rumours, spread like wildfire in Coatbridge.</p>
      <p>“When he is released from prison he will be moving to a different area for his own safety. He realises custody is the only option.</p>
      <p>“He has a criminal record and has served a previous sentence from the High Court.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Frank Pieri, sentencing, told McPhee: “This can only be dealt with by a custodial sentence.”</p>
      <p>McPhee was jailed for 16 months, backdated to June 29.</p>
      <p>The sheriff reduced the sentence from 20 months because of McPhee’s early plea of guilt.</p>
      <p>He was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for 10 years.</p>
