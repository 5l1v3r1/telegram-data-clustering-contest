      <p>BRAZIL EASED the pressure on Tite as they ended a five-match winless run with a comfortable 3-0 win over South Korea on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Tite has come under scrutiny as Brazil have failed to claim a victory since winning the Copa America in July.</p>
      <p>Their miserable run included a 1-0 loss to arch rivals Argentina on Friday, but they bounced back in style in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>Lucas Paqueta opened the scoring early on and a brilliant Philippe Coutinho free-kick doubled the lead for Brazil, who secured a routine triumph through Juventus defender Danilo’s second-half goal.</p>
      <p>Paqueta broke the deadlock in the 10th minute, meeting Renan Lodi’s superb cross with a stooping header after the Atletico Madrid full-back had been played in down the left by Coutinho.</p>
      <p>Lodi continued to cause problems going forward but South Korea also threatened in an entertaining first half.</p>
      <p>Son Heung-min bent an effort narrowly wide but South Korea’s task was made considerably harder when Coutinho doubled their deficit in style.</p>

      <p>The Bayern Munich winger found the top-left corner with a stunning free-kick from 25 yards after Hwang Ui-jo hacked down Fabinho.</p>
      <p>South Korea were almost gifted a lifeline in an incredible passage of play as Alisson fumbled Jung Woo-young’s low free-kick, with Coutinho kicking the ball against his own post in the resulting scramble before clearing behind for a corner.</p>

      <p>However, Brazil made the game safe on the hour mark as Danilo met Lodi’s pull back with a rasping drive that Cho Hyun-woo could not handle despite getting both hands to the shot.</p>
      <p>Brazil took their foot off the gas thereafter, with South Korea reduced to efforts from distance as they failed to score for the third successive game.</p>
