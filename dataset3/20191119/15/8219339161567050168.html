      <p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mimeo-photos/id1282504627?mt=12">Mimeo</a>, a popular third-party printing service that works as an integrated plug-in with Apple’s Photos app for macOS has announced the option to order photo prints including everything from wallet size to portrait and all the way up to large format panoramas.</p>
      <p>Photo books, calendars, and cards were all possible before but starting today, Mimeo is offering the option to easily order photo prints to Mac users.</p>
      <blockquote>With the release of prints, Mimeo Photos completes the full range of offerings that Apple provided prior to getting out of the photo printing business back in 2018. This addition to our product portfolio (card, calendars, books and now prints) solidifies that we are dedicated to providing macOS Photo users the same quality products they used to order from Apple.</blockquote>
