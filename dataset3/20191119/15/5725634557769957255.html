          <b>Featured Stock from October: Discover Financial Services</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Discover Financial Services (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DFS">DFS</a>) is the featured stock from October’s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio. We recently made DFS a Long Idea in <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4301993-discover-financials-stock-trading-discount?source=all_articles_title">October 2019</a> and, despite outperforming (+8% vs. S&amp;P +5%), the stock remains undervalued.</p>
      <p>Since 2010, DFS has grown revenue by 6% compounded annually and after-tax operating profit (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1014071-nopat-definition-and-formulae-for-net-operating-profit-after-tax-and-nopat-margin">NOPAT</a>) by 16% compounded annually. DFS’ trailing twelve months NOPAT of $3.2 billion is up 11% over the prior TTM period. DFS’ NOPAT margin is up from 12% in 2011 to 23% TTM and its return on invested capital (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/1018641-roic-definition-and-formulae-for-return-on-invested-capital">ROIC</a>) also has improved from 11% to 22% over the same time.</p>

          <b>Steady Dividend Growth Supported by FCF</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Discover Financial Services has increased its annual dividend in each year since 2011. The regular annual dividend has grown from $0.92/share in 2014 to $1.64/share TTM, or 12% compounded annually. DFS easily generates the cash flow needed to continue paying and growing its dividend. Since 2014, DFS has generated cumulative FCF of $11.2 billion (44% of market cap) while paying $2.6 billion in dividends.</p>
      <p>Companies with FCF well in excess of dividend payments provide higher quality dividend growth opportunities because we know the firm generates the cash to support a higher dividend. On the other hand, the dividend of a company where FCF falls short of the dividend payment over time cannot be trusted to grow or even stay the same because of inadequate free cash flow.</p>

          <b>DFS Holds Significant Upside Potential</b>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>At its current price of $82/share, DFS has a price-to-economic book value (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/753641-david-trainer/942151-definition-price-to-ebv-or-price-to-economic-book-value-ratio">PEBV</a>) ratio of 0.7. This ratio means the market expects DFS’ NOPAT to permanently decline by 30%. This expectation seems rather pessimistic for a firm that has grown NOPAT by 16% compounded annually since 2010 and 11% compounded annually since 2007.</p>
      <p>If DFS can maintain a 22% NOPAT margin (slightly down from 23% in 2018) and grow NOPAT by 5% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock is worth $150/share today, an 83% upside to the current stock price. <a href="https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/NewConstructs_DCF_DFSvaluation_2019-11-04.png">See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario</a>. Add in DFS’ 2.2% dividend yield and history of dividend growth, and it’s clear why this stock is in October’s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio.</p>
