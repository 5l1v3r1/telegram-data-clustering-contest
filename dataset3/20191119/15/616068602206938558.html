      <p>Penticton city councillors minced no words Tuesday, lambasting the owner of the infamous property at 377 Winnipeg, ordering the home be demolished by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“I’m really pleased to see this coming forward, it's long overdue,” said Coun. Katie Robinson. “I can’t wait for it to be done, consider it an early Christmas present from council to the city.”</p>
      <p>Council voted unanimously Tuesday to declare the boarded-up home “offensive to the community” and give landowner Malvinder Singh Randhawa until Dec. 31 to remove the structure. If the deadline is not met, the city will take Randhawa to court and obtain a civil injunction. </p>
      <p>“My frustration is with the blatant disrespect for not only the neighbours, but for our City of Penticton by this particular property owner,” said Coun. Judy Sentes. “I’m deeply offended, as I think all of Penticton is, especially the neighbours.”</p>
      <p>377 Winnipeg has been empty since its tenants <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/233863/377-winnipeg-evicted">were evicted</a> by a bailiff — paid for by a neighbour — in August 2018 following a public outcry over allegations of criminal activity at the home. The city had cut power to the home months prior, leaving tenants to rely on generators for power. </p>
      <p>The city says Randhawa has done nothing to fix up the property since then, despite being asked in writing to do so on Oct. 16, 2018. Bylaw officers have been called to the home "consistently" to re-secure the building since it was boarded up.</p>
      <p>“Let’s move on this,” said Coun. Jake Kimberley, calling the situation “shameful.”</p>
      <p>Randhawa owes the city $4,120 in outstanding bylaw fines and fees, which will be collected through property taxes should payment not be made. </p>
      <p>Coun. Julius Bloomfield said he “wholeheartedly supports” the move, adding he hopes it gets a message to other landlords in the city that they are cracking down on problem properties. The <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/263046/city-orders-home-flattened">city ordered</a> the demolition of a dilapidated home on Brunswick Street over the summer, which has since been removed. </p>
      <p>Bylaw services manager Tina Siebert said there are “a few” more properties she is working with that could be brought before council if compliance is not achieved.</p>
