      <h1>Clamp down on used car lots parking on streets illegally</h1>
      <h2>Four untaxed and uninsured vehicles have been clamped and towed away</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:29:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:29</time> by <a rel="author">Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Used car lots, which have been parking their vehicles illegally on nearby streets, have been subjected to a DVLA crackdown.</p>
      <p>A joint operation in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/st-george">St George</a> between the police, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council's</a> parking enforcement team, and NSL, the contractors working for the DVLA, targeted two car sales yards who have been illegally parking vehicles on residential streets.</p>
      <p>The latest raids took place in Nicholas Lane, John Wesley Road, Preacher Close and Dundridge Lane.</p>
      <p>The area saw untaxed and uninsured vehicles clamped and towed away.</p>
      <p>But one dealer tried to make a getaway with one of his vehicles leaving the contact worker trying to clamp it injured.</p>

      <p>Councillor Fabian Brecels, the local Labour &amp; Co-operative Councillor for St George Troopers Hill ward said the following.</p>
      <p>"We have seen cars towed away that have been clogging up the streets of St George for months.</p>
      <p>"These raids will now become more frequent, so the message to the car dealers is a simple one: become good neighbours or ship out.</p>
      <p>"I would like to thank our Parking Enforcement Teams, the Police and NSL, the contractors working for the DVLA for working together to bring this raid about. It was a good result.</p>
      <p>"The latest raids show that we are committed to tackling problem parking by some of Bristol's dealers. Bristolians will, I am sure, join us in wishing a speedy recovery and return to work to the clamper who hurt his hand when one dealer tried to make a getaway mid operation."</p>

      <p>Bristol City Councillors have pushed for the DVLA to do more to tackle car sales yards on Bryants Hill and Nags Head Hill , which have a long history of parking illegally, much to the annoyance of local residents.</p>
      <p>This includes leaving vehicles on double yellow lines which are untaxed and uninsured.</p>
      <p>After the success of these raids in St George, similar joint operations are planned across other areas of Bristol.</p>
