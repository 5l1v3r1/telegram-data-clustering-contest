      <p>Last week Apple <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apples-16-inch-macbook-pro-is-now-official/">announced the much anticipated MacBook Pro</a> with a 16-inch display. Along with the bigger screen, the MacBook Pro also features a new keyboard layout which fixes the issues Apple has been having with their keyboards.</p>
      <p>While everyone’s praising Apple for their keyboard improvement, there’s one area where MacBook still misses the mark and that’s repairability. Just a week after the official launch, the folks over at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106">iFixit</a> popped open the MacBook Pro and gave it a mere 1 out of 10 on their repairability. iFixit summarised the teardown with the following bullet points.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The trackpad can still be removed and replaced with very little drama.</li>
        <li>Minor components are modular, but the processor, RAM, and flash memory are soldered to the logic board.</li>
        <li>Glue and/or rivets secure the keyboard, battery, speakers, and Touch Bar, making those components a tricky fix.</li>
        <li>The Touch ID sensor is the power switch and is locked to the logic board, greatly complicating repairs.</li>
        <li>Once again, the keyboard assembly is riveted down. It’s basically 2016 all over again: a new keyboard married to a non-serviceable design, with only Apple’s word (and fairly reliable precedent) that it won’t break.</li>
        <li>The MacBook Pro’s 99.8 Wh battery flies just under the FAA radar, weighing in at 16.2 Wh more capacity than the most recent 15” model. With such a slight increase in case size, this capacity increase is surprising.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>While MacBook Pro is not the first device to receive such a low score (<a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ifixit-awards-surface-laptop-2-0-points-may-god-have-mercy-on-its-soul/">Surface Laptop 2 received 0</a>), it certainly is the worst scoring premium device. With <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/ifixits-teardown-of-surface-laptop-3-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-replace-ssd-and-other-components/">Microsoft Surface Laptop 3 scoring 5</a>, the burden now falls on Apple to redesign their laptop inside out.</p>
