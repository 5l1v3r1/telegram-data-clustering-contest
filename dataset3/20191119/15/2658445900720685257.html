      <p>The Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu on Tuesday disclosed that the Police was aware of the plan by politicians to sew police uniforms for their supporters during the Kogi and Bayelsa governorship elections.</p>
      <p>He also alleged that the fake ‘policemen’ disrupted the November 16 governorship elections in parts of the two States.</p>
      <p>He insisted that they are not the personnel officially deployed for election duties by the Police Force.</p>
      <p>Adamu briefed State House correspondents at the end of security meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.</p>
      <p>He said that investigation is on to identify those that caused violence during the elections.</p>

      <p>Adamu said 11 arrests have been made.</p>
      <p>According to him, all security personnel, who worked during the elections, were given “special identification tags”</p>
      <p>He said anyone without the tags was on illegal duty.</p>
      <p>The security situation in the country, he said, is stable.</p>
      <p>On the alleged police extortion of motorists in South East by police officers at checkpoints, he advised that people should always copy the names of such police officers and report them to the police hierarchy in the area.</p>
