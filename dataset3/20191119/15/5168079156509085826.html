      <h1>Amazon deforestation in Brazil hits worst level in over a decade</h1>

      <p>The rate of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest in Brazil rose to its highest level in more than a decade this year, according to government data published on Monday.<br/><br/>Between August 2018 and July 2019, deforestation reached 9,762 square kilometers (3,769 square miles), the National Institute for Space Research said.<br/><br/>The figures represent a 29.5% increase compared to last year, and the highest level since 2008.<br/><br/>Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said new strategies were needed to combat illegal logging, mining and land-grabbing, which he said were to blame for the rise in deforestation.</p>
      <p>The ministry is due to meet with the governors in the Amazon region on Thursday to discuss ways to combat the issue.<br/><br/>Pressure mounting on Bolsonaro<br/><br/><br/><br/>Environmental groups and NGOs say that Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's rhetoric and his environmental policies are to blame for the rise in illegal activity in the Amazon.<br/><br/>"The Bolsonaro government is responsible for every inch of forest destroyed. This government today is the worst enemy of the Amazon," said Marcio Astrini, public policy coordinator for Greenpeace, in a statement.<br/><br/>Concerns over the future of the Amazon were heightened after the right-wing leader took office in January.<br/><br/>Bolsonaro has advocated loosening protections for natural reserves and indigenous lands in the rainforest as a way to boost economic development.<br/><br/>One of the biggest drivers of deforestation in the region is also due to the high price of beef in Brazil, which encourages land grabbing for cattle ranching.<br/><br/>The Amazon is the largest tropical rainforest in the world and is considered key in the fight against climate change due to the amounts of CO2 it absorbs.<br/><br/>Fires that raged through the Amazon in July and August this year sparked global concern and drew criticism from French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>
