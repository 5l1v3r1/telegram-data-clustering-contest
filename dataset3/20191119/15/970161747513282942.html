      <p>Two jail workers who were on duty when billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein killed himself have been arrested for failing to check on him.</p>
      <p>The pair of federal prison staffers were taken into custody on Tuesday morning in New York.</p>
      <p>They are expected to be charged later Tuesday and appear in the US District Court in Manhattan. Authorities have not yet identified the guards.</p>
      <p>The charges against the two prison workers would be the first criminal charges to be filed during the criminal inquiry into the death of Epstein, who reportedly hanged himself at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Epstein ‘sexually exploited and abused dozens of minor girls’ at his homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida, as well as other locations in 2002 to 2005.</p>

      <p>The far-reaching Epstein scandal has cast a huge shadow on the British royal family after Prince Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, was probed over his friendship with Epstein.</p>

      <p>Epstein and Prince Andrew, 59, were photographed walking through New York City’s Central Park after Epstein had been convicted of prostitution of minors in 2010. A photo of Prince Andrew with his arm around a 17-year-old alleged Epstein victim, Virginia Roberts, now known as Virginia Guiffre, also surfaced.</p>
      <p>Guiffre is one of the many women who said they were abused by Epstein and she has alleged in court that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew.</p>
      <p>According to court records, Guiffre said she was forced to have sex with the duke three times in London, at Epstein’s home in New York and at an ‘orgy’ on Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean. She has recently called for Prince Andrew to ‘go to jail.’ Andrew has repeatedly denied ever having sex with Guiffre, amid claims the photo of him posing with her may have been doctored.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew is not the only high-profile person who is accused of having ties with Epstein. Ex-Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton also allegedly ran in similar social circles with Epstein.</p>

      <p>Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and booked at the Manhattan jailhouse. Officials said the guards who were arrested Tuesday were responsible for monitoring the high-security unit where Epstein was being held when he committed suicide.</p>
      <p>They were supposed to check on Epstein every half hour – but instead, they fell asleep for hours and allegedly falsified records to cover up what they had done.</p>

      <p>Prison union representatives had long warned of understaffing at the Manhattan prison and frequent overtime shifts that exhausted officers and compromised the facility’s safety.</p>
      <p>Ten of the 18 workers who were on duty during the time of Epstein’s suicide were working overtime, according to federal prison records.</p>
      <p>In the wake of Epstein’s death, Attorney General William Barr ordered multiple investigations into the disgraced financier’s suicide, focusing on operations at the prison where Epstein was being held.</p>
      <p>Three weeks before he died, Epstein had been found semiconscious in his cell with bruises on his neck. Authorities then put him on suicide watch, but he was removed days later, which is a decision that has also been scrutinized.</p>
      <p>‘When removing such a high-risk individual from suicide watch, it would be critical to do it in a step-down fashion so that there is still some extra monitoring,’ clinical psychologist and jail suicide expert Lisa Boesky told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/19/prison-guards-arrested-alleged-failure-check-jeffrey-epstein/4082679002/">USA Today. </a></p>
      <p>Federal prosecutors said they are still investigating Epstein’s alleged sex crimes and have shifted their focus to anyone who helped or enabled Epstein.</p>
      <p>‘Let me assure you that this case will continue on against anyone who was complicit. The victims deserve justice, and they will get it,’ Attorney General Barr said.</p>
