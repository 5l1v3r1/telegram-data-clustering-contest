      <p>Known for her strong accent, Coyle assured fellow campmate Ian Wright that she had no problem repeating she says, if needs be.</p>
      <p>Prior to entering the jungle, the former Girls Aloud singer insisted she was determined to overcome her fears.</p>
      <p>"I really want to try something completely new. I am scared of so many things. I used to be brave. In the past, I’ve opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these," she said.</p>
