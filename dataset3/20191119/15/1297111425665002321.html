      <h2>Saskatchewan's Growth Plan hinges on factors that remain outside the government's control, said an economist who gave the 20-point program for the next decade mixed reviews.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:47:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/awhitecrummey" target="_blank">Arthur White-Crummey</a></address>
      <p>Saskatchewan’s strategy to turbocharge its economy through technology and trade is short on details and high on ambition, according to an economist who doubts the province will meet all the targets in its newly released growth plan.</p>
      <p>Joel Bruneau, head of the economics department at the University of Saskatchewan, said it’s not unreasonable to aim for 100,000 more jobs by 2030. But he thinks the provincial government’s steps to achieve that sound “very vague.”</p>
      <p>Released on Thursday in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan’s Growth Plan was <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/moe-aims-for-1-4-million-saskatchewanians-and-100000-more-jobs-by-2030">the centrepiece of the final throne speech before the 2020 provincial election</a>. Premier Scott Moe said the “ultimate overarching goal” for the next decade is growing the population to 1.4 million people.</p>
      <p>The government plans to get there through 20 actions and 30 goals that include boosting private investment to $16 billion, adding 50 per cent to exports and increasing oil production to 600,000 barrels per day.</p>
      <p>“It’s hard to see how government has control over a lot of those outcomes,” Bruneau said.</p>
      <p>That’s because so much depends on volatile commodity markets and prices set on a global level. The same goes for targets to expand potash sales to $9 billion and uranium sales to $2 billion. How much Saskatchewan earns for those products will hinge, in part, on what goes on in other major producing countries.</p>
      <p>Moe acknowledged on Thursday that natural resource prices “ebb and flow” and will continue to do so. But he said the province does have control over its trading relationships, and is taking action to strengthen them in key markets.</p>
      <p>That includes plans to open three new international trade offices in Japan, India and Singapore.</p>
      <p>Bruneau said those locations make a lot of sense, especially given <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/saskatchewan-gives-enthusiastic-ok-to-trans-pacific-partnership-agreement">opportunities presented by a recent trade deal with Asia-Pacific countries</a>. He just doesn’t think the province should expect its trade offices to work wonders when market access depends far more on the federal government.</p>
      <p>“These provincial offices don’t create new access, but they do facilitate access,” he said. “They’re really just helping firms to understand what those marketplaces look like.”</p>
      <p>But Bruneau did see points to like in the plan. He commended the focus on breaking down interprovincial trade barriers. He also agrees that Saskatchewan can have success fostering value-added processing in its existing areas of strength. Notably, the plan calls for Saskatchewan to process 50 per cent of its peas and crush 75 per cent of its canola within the province.</p>
      <p>The plan is also relatively specific on which industries stand to benefit from narrow tax cuts to boost innovation. Both chemical fertilizers and agricultural technology can expect targeted tax incentives, which the government says will make them more competitive.</p>
      <p>According to Bruneau, the evidence suggests that targeted tax cuts are often more successful than broad-based corporate tax breaks. But he warned that the province is essentially picking winners and losers. It might be right, but it could be wrong.</p>
      <p>The plan banks heavily on innovation. The government intends to triple the size of Saskatchewan’s technology sector, and technological development is part of its path for achieving almost every other goal.</p>
      <p>That sounds like a fine idea to Bruneau, but it’s difficult to know how to get there.</p>
      <p>“The only problem is you can’t predict something like innovation, because the whole point about innovation is if I knew it was innovative, I’d do it already,” he said.</p>
      <p>But some of the specifics make him scratch his head, including the government’s proposal to create a “rural tech hub” to attract technology companies to smaller centres. He thinks it might be more about good politics than good economics.</p>
      <p>“That sounds a little more pie in the sky,” he said.</p>
      <p>Bruneau was especially enthusiastic about the government’s commitment to maintain a balanced budget annually. He said sound fiscal management is one of the areas where a government can send a strong signal about its credibility. It also helps the province prepare for a rainy day.</p>
      <p>“We should be running budget surpluses, so precisely when there’s a downturn, you can then invest in roads and create jobs,” said Bruneau.</p>
      <p>All in all, Bruneau seemed doubtful that the plan could succeed across the board. But he didn’t rule it out.</p>
      <p>“These are ambitious targets. But if you talked to me in 2007, and said Saskatchewan is going to be leading all the provinces in population growth, is going to have the fastest population growth in Canada, you’d probably say, whoa, that’s really ambitious,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That was unexpected. So, you know, good things can happen.”</p>
