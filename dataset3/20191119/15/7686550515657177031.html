      <p>Winter is fast approaching and while most people can keep warm at home, there are thousands of rough sleepers on the UK streets battling through the ice and rain. <br/><br/>According to government statistics from 2018, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/781567/Rough_Sleeping_Statistics_2018_release.pdf">4677 people sleep rough each night in England</a> , forced to bed down in streets, tents, doorways and other outdoor areas.</p>
      <p>However, instead of just walking by a homeless person, there are certain things you can do to benefit their life and well being.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/how-you-can-help-you-17276275">Glasgow Live</a> has highlighted five steps you can take if you're concerned about a homeless person:</p>

        <b>Phone your local council's homelessness team</b>
      </p>
      <p>Every district's council will have a homelessness team, qualified to help rough sleepers and point them in the right direction of the appropriate helplines.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/homelessness/rules/emergency_housing_if_you_are_homeless">Shelter England,</a> local councils can provide emergency housing for anyone who is currently homeless, have priority need for housing, or those that meet immigration and residence conditions.</p>
      <p>The council can be contacted by phone, or you can visit them in person and book an appointment.</p>
      <p>If possible, homeless people should take some identification with them such as a passport or ID card, proof of income and evidence why you've found yourself homeless (e.g an eviction notice).</p>
      <p>
        <b>Contact The Simon Community</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Simon Community is a charity which helps homeless people.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to contact the charity is by calling the community office on: 020 7485 6639; they will put you through to the relevant districts and charities.</p>
      <p>Even if there isn't a homeless person you're concerned about, The Simon Community are always looking for volunteers to help out at the shelter.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Write down some details about the individual</b>
      </p>
      <p>A more immediate step to follow when you're worried about a rough sleeper is to write down some basic details about them. <br/><br/>Take note of their precise location and also write down some of their defining features; what clothes are they wearing? What is their gender?</p>
      <p>Writing this down will help any local charities and authorities to track them down and hopefully provide them some shelter.</p>
      <p><b>Be friendly <br/></b>Rough sleeping can be lonely. They're used to people walking wast them without stopping for a conversation.</p>
      <p>Simply saying 'hello' and being friendly can make the biggest difference to their day. You might learn more about their situation and offer them support and advice about where to turn to next.</p>
      <p>During the colder months in particular, offering homeless people a hot drink is a kind gesture that would make sleeping rough a little more comfortable.</p>
      <p>If you have the time and budget, you could also make a care package for rough sleepers. This could be filled with winter clothes, blankets and maybe even menstrual products for women who are sleeping rough.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Give them directions of local shelters</b>
      </p>
      <p>Homeless people might not have access to the internet, unable to find where the local shelters and soup kitchens are. This <a href="https://www.homeless.org.uk/homeless-england/search-near-me">Homeless Link website</a> can find homelessness charities and services near by.</p>
