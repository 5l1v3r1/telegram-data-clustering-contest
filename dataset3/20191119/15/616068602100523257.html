      <p>The downtown Kelowna library has shown its support for this week’s OUT in the Valley festival in a big way, announcing it will become a financial sponsor. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kelownapride.com/outinthevalley">OUT in the Valley</a> is Canada’s only queer wine festival, hosted by Kelowna Pride in partnership with the BC Wine, Cider &amp; Spirits Festival. </p>
      <p>As well as hosting the fourth annual Sugarplum Ball at the library on Saturday, the library will also partially cover venue rental costs for the evening.</p>
      <p>“Kelowna library staff and staff in other branches of the Okanagan Regional Library system recently raised funds in support of Kelowna Pride. Even one of the library’s security guards contributed significantly towards the organization," said Kelowna branch head librarian Christopher Stephens.</p>
      <p>Kelowna Pride co-president Blake Edwards says it is inspiring to see the library making efforts towards greater inclusivity.</p>
      <p>"This donation goes to show the support of the staff for LGBT2Q+ initiatives with the library – from Drag Storytime to our Sugarplum Ball. I'd like to thank all the 'activist librarians' in bringing inclusive programming to a public forum."</p>
      <p>The festival takes place Thursday through Sunday, featuring hop-on hop-off style wine tours, entertainment and tastings. For OUT in the Valley tickets and event descriptions, visit <a href="http://kelownapride.com/">kelownapride.com</a>. </p>
