      <h3>Dream11 Tips And Prediction</h3>
      <p>Dream11 Team Prediction Melbourne Stars Women vs Perth Scorchers Women WBBL – Cricket Tips For Today’s Match 39 MS-W vs PS-W of Women’s Big Bash League 2019 in Melbourne: In the match no. 39 of Women’s Big Bash League 2019, Melbourne Stars will host Perth Scorchers at the Junction Oval in Melbourne. It will be a big challenge for the struggling Stars side to face the in-form Scorchers in a high-octane WBBL clash. Brisbane Heat ended Perth Scorchers three-match winning streak in the previous encounter. The visitors will be keen on getting back to the winning ways with the tournament heading into its final phase. They are currently at the fifth position after nine matches with five wins.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Stars, who are languishing at the bottom of the table have lost 8 matches in the season so far. Every match is a must-win for them now on to even have a slender of chances to make it to the semi-finals. The margin of defeats are likely to hurt Stars at the end as they have an extremely poor run-rate of -0.919. A lot will depend on the shoulders of skipper Elyse Villani, who will have to lead from the front to lift the home side.</p>
