      <h1>Bong Joon Ho Won’t Direct a Marvel Movie Because Their Clothes Are Too Tight</h1>

      <p>Your favorite auteur <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/bong-joon-ho-parasite.html">Bong Joon Ho</a> is banishing Marvel to the basement. He has a problem <i>so </i>big,<i> </i>in fact, that he knows he’ll never be able to direct a film for the franchise. No, he doesn’t think it’s “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/martin-scorsese-doubles-down-on-marvel-movie-critique.html">not cinema</a>.” He also doesn’t believe it’s “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/francis-ford-coppola-says-marvel-films-are-despicable.html">despicable</a>.” You know those supersuits? The ones that still have capes despite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M68ndaZSKa8">repeated</a> safety warnings? Now we’re talking. “I have a personal problem. I respect the creativity that goes into superhero films, but in real life and in movies, I can’t stand people wearing tight-fitting clothes,” he <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/parasite-bong-joon-ho-success-next-movies-marvel-netflix-1203408123/">told <i>Variety</i></a><i> </i>when asked if he’d consider directing for Marvel. “I’ll never wear something like that, and just seeing someone in tight clothes is mentally difficult. I don’t know where to look, and I feel suffocated. Most superheroes wear tight suits, so I can never direct one. I don’t think anyone will offer the project to me either. If there is a superhero who has a very boxy costume, maybe I can try.”</p>
      <p>When Bong was reminded he already worked with Chris Evans, a.k.a the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/scarlett-johansson-chris-evans-marvel-controversy.html">Best Hollywood Chris</a> and Captain America, on his 2013 film <i>Snowpiercer, </i>he jokingly shrugged off the connection. “Chris Evans slips on a fish,” he said. “I don’t think that is Marvel’s sensibility.” No, Marvel’s sensibility is more “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/captain-america-has-americas-best-ass-according-to-endgame.html">America’s Ass</a>.”</p>
