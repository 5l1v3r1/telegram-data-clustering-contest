      <p>One follower told Toni: ‘Please don’t stay away too long Toni! Your show was AMAZE INCREDIBLE!!! 💖U 👑’</p>
      <p>Other than this,<a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/toni-braxton-shares-jaw-dropping-photos-from-a-concert-tamar-braxton-praises-her-sister-340464/"> Toni shared a couple of new pics</a> from a concert. She’s on stage, and Tamar Braxton’s sister looks amazing.</p>
      <p>Toni’s fans agree, and they made sure to praise this lady in the comments, and Tamar did the same thing.</p>
      <p>Both sisters are living their best lives, and just in case you’re wondering how’s Tamar doing these days, well, she seems to be really happy with her son Logan and BF David Adefeso.</p>
