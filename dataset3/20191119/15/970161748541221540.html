        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/wiley/">Wiley</a> has breathed new life into his feuds with Skepta and Dizzee Rascal after challenging both rappers to a street clash.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Heatwave rapper entertained his Twitter followers on Monday by tweeting that he was ready to battle Skepta with bars on the streets of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> in London, seemingly unprovoked.</p>
      <p>‘I will clash you @Skepta on Tottenham HIgh Road do you wanna do it? [sic]’ he wrote.</p>
      <p>But when one fan wondered why he hadn’t challenged his other rival, Dizzee, to a rap battle, he was more than happy to oblige and replied: ‘Both I’m ready… 1 day dizzee another day Skepta.’</p>
      <p>Explaining why he’s choosing the rap battle route, Wiley explained: ‘Grime is a Physical genre and is a niche thing that is best when kept away from the charts and corporations.If dizzee clashes me on the street this is more powerful than any label could do for me or dizzee [sic].</p>

      <p>‘If you attempt to sell grime via major label or streaming before physical,You have already failed.Back to the village immediately.’</p>
      <p>He then warned any other brave critics: ‘Don’t try it with me unless your prepared to clash me on your block or my block.’</p>

      <p>Without mentioning any names, Wiley they predicted: ‘People who only care about chart positions &amp; video views &amp; not the music won’t be here long.They come &amp; go.’</p>
      <p>Wiley’s feud with Dizzee goes all the way back to 2003 with an incident in Ayia Napa.</p>
      <p>A brawl reportedly erupted between So Solid Crew and Roll Deep which Wiley has previously admitted to fuelling.</p>
      <p>‘Then the next day, I decided to carry it on – I didn’t pull out a knife. ‘I was just fighting… Well, after we started it up again, those guys came looking for us. But the person they found was Dizzee,’ Wiley told Time Out in 2016.</p>
      <p>The altercation resulted in Dizzee getting stabbed by a rival.</p>

      <p>Wiley explained: ‘Now I’m older, I can see: Dizzee in his head will always be thinking: “I know we got into a beef. I know something started. But you lot carried it on the next day. If you had left it I wouldn’t have got stabbed”. That is the reason me and Dizzee haven’t spoken all these years.’</p>
      <p>Then in 2018, Wiley criticised Skepta for collaborating with Dizzee which in turn sparked a new beef with the Boy Better Know star.</p>

      <p>It seemed as though Wiley was done with beefing for a while with his last public feud involving Ed Sheeran and Stormzy back in September.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old reacted to Stormzy collaborating with Ed on the grime track Take Me Back To London and claimed the popstar ‘doesn’t care’ about the genre.</p>
      <p>Then there’s also Wiley’s ongoing tension with Drake but we’ll leave that one for another day…</p>
