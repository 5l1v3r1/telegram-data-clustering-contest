      <p>Shares of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/work-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Slack</a> fell as much as 11% Tuesday after <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/msft-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Microsoft</a> reported that its competing messaging product, Teams, has 20 million daily active users. </p>
      <p>That's 8 million more users than Slack, which reported <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-daily-active-users-microsoft-teams-2019-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">12 million daily active users</a> in October. </p>
      <p>It's also a huge gain in the lead Microsoft already had over Slack. In July, the company announced that it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-teams-daily-active-users-slack-2019-7?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">had 13 million daily active users</a>. That means that Microsoft has seen usage of Teams increase more than 50% in the last few months. <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/msft-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Microsoft</a> shares were relatively unchanged Tuesday. </p>
      <p>Slack, on the other hand, has argued that while it doesn't have as many daily active users, the ones that do use the application spend more than nine hours a day using it, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-daily-active-users-microsoft-teams-2019-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">showing that people actually like using the product</a>. </p>
      <p>The company has also previously called out Microsoft for its business practices, calling it <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-ceo-microsoft-sees-us-as-an-existential-threat-2019-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">"surprisingly unsportsmanlike</a>." Microsoft offers Teams for free to businesses that use Microsoft Office 365, which could mean that it's counting users that don't actually use Teams very often, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/slack-ceo-microsoft-sees-us-as-an-existential-threat-2019-10?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield has claimed. </a></p>
      <p><a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/work-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Slack is down more than 45%</a> since spiking nearly 50% during its first day of public trading in June.</p>
      <p>Slack has a consensus price target of $29.65 and nine "buy" ratings, 8 "hold" ratings, and two "sell" ratings from analysts covering the company, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
