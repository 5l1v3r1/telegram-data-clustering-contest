      <p>Fancy a day out? Well get yourself a lottery ticket, because it doesn’t just come with the chance of winning some money – it could help you save some too.</p>
      <p>Next week, over 500 attractions will give you free entry or discounts with a lottery ticket or scratchcard to celebrate the National Lottery’s 25h birthday.</p>
      <p>They’re all places that have been helped by National Lottery funding and the idea is to say thank you to all those who play the lottery and help to contribute £30 million to good causes every week.</p>
      <p>Offers include free entry to the London Transport Museum, two for one entry to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kensington-palace/">Kensington Palace</a> and a free hot drink at the Science Museum (It’s already free to visit).</p>

      <p>You can find all the attractions taking part in your area by <a href="https://www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/projects/thanks-to-you">entering your postcode online.</a></p>
      <p>All you have to do to use the offer is pick up a ticket for Lotto, Euromillions, Thunderball, Hot Picks, Set for Life, Instant Win Games or a scratchcard and take it along to the attraction.</p>

      <p>You don’t even have to go to a shop to pick one up – you can play online or via the National Lottery app and still use the deal.</p>
      <p>And if you have an old ticket in your purse or in a drawer, (after you’ve checked it’s definitely not a winning one you’ve forgotten about) you can use it as the date on the ticket doesn’t matter for the deal.</p>
      <p>The offer runs from 23 November until 1 December but some venues are only offering the deal on select days so check online before you visit.</p>
      <p>Sounds like everyone is a winner.</p>
