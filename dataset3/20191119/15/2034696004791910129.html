        <b>Is it finally here?</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/stormzy">Stormzy</a>‘s fans are speculating that his second album could finally be on the way, after a series of mysterious projections were spotted across London.</p>
      <p>Only weeks after the London rapper confirmed that he’s <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-has-almost-finished-work-on-his-new-album-2565929">almost finished work</a> on the follow up to 2017’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/stormzy-gang-signs-prayer-album-review">Gang Signs and Prayer</a>‘, the projection appeared on the front of Shoreditch High Street Overground Station and St Paul’s Cathedral last night (November 18).</p>
      <p>Bearing the initials ‘H.I.T.H’, fans are suggesting that it could be a potential album title – with one arguing that it’s the lyric “Heavy Is The Head” from <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-announces-new-single-crown-out-this-week-2511433">his recent hit single ‘Crown’.</a></p>
      <p>The same initials also featured at the end of his recent release ‘Wiley Flow’.</p>

      <p>Others have suggested that it could be “Home In The Hood”. Stormzy himself is yet to comment, but NME has contacted his representatives for comment.</p>

      <p>Speaking at a show in Thorpe Park earlier this month (November 7), the grime star told the crowd: “[At] literally 6am in the morning, I literally finished the final vocal for my [new] album.”</p>
      <p>While the second album is yet to emerge, he’s released a slew of new tracks including <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-sounds-of-the-skeng-single-sir-spyro-2545436">‘Sounds of the Skeng’</a>, the aforementioned ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-announces-new-single-crown-out-this-week-2511433">Crown’</a> and ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-takes-aim-at-boris-johnson-on-new-track-vossi-bop-2481150">Vossi Bop</a>’ which gave him <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/stormzy-scores-first-ever-uk-number-one-single-vossi-bop-2484057">his first ever UK Number One single</a>, while also clocking up the biggest week of streams ever for a rapper.</p>
