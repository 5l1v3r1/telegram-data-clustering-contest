      <h1>Pac-12 Power Rankings, Week 11: Washington drops further down after bye week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:21:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:21</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/author/cap-jon-wilner/" target="_blank">Jon Wilner</a></address>
      <p>The Ducks and Utes chewed up and spit out their latest victims, while the Huskies sat idle in week 10. With just two weeks left in the regular-season, the stretch run will be fascinating for the Pac-12. How many bowl teams will the conference end up with, and will Oregon or Utah crack the College Football Playoff?</p>
      <p>Here we go …</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Oregon (9-1/7-0)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 1</p>
      <p>Result: Beat Arizona 34-6</p>
      <p>Next up: at Arizona State</p>
      <p>Comment: Not that we expect it to happen, but the worst non-injury development for the Ducks would be to climb into the top four of the CFP rankings. They’re much better off in the No. 5 or 6 slots through the Pac-12 title game.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Utah (9-1/6-1)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 2</p>
      <p>Result: Beat UCLA 49-3</p>
      <p>Next up: at Arizona</p>
      <p>Comment: Without much fanfare, and with only one interception, Tyler Huntley has produced a season worthy of Pac-12 Player of the Year honors.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. USC (7-4/6-2)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 4</p>
      <p>Result: Won at Cal 41-17</p>
      <p>Next up: vs. UCLA</p>
      <p>Comment: The Clay Helton Watch will officially begin Sunday morning. The sooner USC makes a move, the better for the program: The early-signing window opens in one month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Washington (6-4/3-4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 3</p>
      <p>Result: open date</p>
      <p>Next up: at Colorado</p>
      <p>Comment: Everything points to two decisive wins and an 8-4 finish, which means 7-5 would feel more like 6-6 … kind of like 8-4 feels like 6-6 when compared to 10-2. Or something like that.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Oregon State (5-5/4-3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 6</p>
      <p>Result: Beat Arizona State 35-34</p>
      <p>Next up: at Washington State</p>
      <p>Comment: Wish we could say we saw the turnaround coming, but the Hotline pegged OSU for four wins and thought that might be a stretch.</p>

      <p>
        <b>6. UCLA (4-6/4-3)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 5</p>
      <p>Result: Lost at Utah 49-3</p>
      <p>Next up: at USC</p>
      <p>Comment: Forget the wipeout. It’s a two-game season, and who figured the Bruins would be in this position a month ago.</p>
      <p>
        <b>7. Washington State (5-5/2-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 10</p>
      <p>Result: Beat Stanford 49-22</p>
      <p>Next up: vs. Oregon State</p>
      <p>Comment: Two efficient and entertaining offenses against two flawed and therefore entertaining defenses. No wonder the over/under Saturday is 75. (And might get close to 80 before kickoff.)</p>
      <p>
        <b>8. Arizona State (5-5/2-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 8</p>
      <p>Result: Lost at Oregon State 35-34</p>
      <p>Next up: vs. Oregon</p>
      <p>Comment: Anyone expecting a little Herm magic this week? … Bueller? … Bueller?</p>
      <p>
        <b>9. Cal (5-5/2-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 7</p>
      <p>Result: Lost to USC 41-17</p>
      <p>Next up: at Stanford</p>
      <p>Comment: Were Chase Garbers healthy, we’d like the Bears to win Big Game for the first time since 2009. Without Garbers, we see no path to victory for Cal that doesn’t include at least two scores on defense and/or special teams.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10. Stanford (4-6/3-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 9</p>
      <p>Result: Lost at Washington State 49-22</p>
      <p>Next up: vs. Cal</p>
      <p>Comment: The depleted defense matches up much better against the Bear Crawl than it did the Air Raid.</p>
      <p>
        <b>11. Colorado (4-6/2-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 11</p>
      <p>Result: open date</p>
      <p>Next up: vs. Washington</p>
      <p>Comment: Final home game for Steven Montez and (unofficially) Laviska Shenault should be emotional … and that makes us think the Buffaloes have a fighting chance.</p>
      <p>
        <b>12. Arizona (4-6/2-5)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last week: 12</p>
      <p>Result: Lost at Oregon 34-6</p>
      <p>Next up: vs. Utah</p>
      <p>Comment: Not sure what the Wildcats are trying to accomplish with the quarterback position by starting Grant Gunnell over Khalil Tate, yanking him after three series, then returning to Gunnell in the second half of a blowout. Play him, or don’t play him.</p>
