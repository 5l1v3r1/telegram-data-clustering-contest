      <p>It's been more than 100 years since Operation Santa began, and the program that was designed to bring a smile to children around the country is still going strong. </p>
      <p>When the program started in 1912 by then-Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock, it didn't have a name. But Hitchcock allowed local postmasters, employees, and everyday people to pick a letter written to Santa and respond.</p>
      <p>In the 1940s, Santa received so much mail, charitable organizations and corporations started to help write back to children and families and provided small gifts.</p>
      <p>Operation Santa is once again online at <a href="https://www.uspsoperationsanta.com/">USPSOperationSanta.com</a>.</p>

      <p>On the website, you can read through the letters that have been sent to Santa's mail room and answer one or more.</p>
      <p>Some of the letters were <a href="https://www.uspsoperationsanta.com/letters/11281">written by children</a> who are asking for video games, Legos and other toys. </p>
      <p>But some of the letters, <a href="https://www.uspsoperationsanta.com/letters/11593">written by adults</a>, talk about the struggles they are experiencing, but who still want to provide a Merry Christmas for their children.</p>

      <p>If you want to help, you begin by registering online and go through an identification process. Then you go <a href="https://www.uspsoperationsanta.com/ship#find-location">to a participating post office</a>, with letter and gift in hand, to ship it to the recipient. A code included on the letter matches the name and address of the child or family that had submitted the request to Santa. </p>
