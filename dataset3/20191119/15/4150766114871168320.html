      <p>The government collected $2.40 billion in revenue from taxation during the first 10 months of this year – up 28.31 per cent year-on-year from $1.873 billion – a report from the General Department of Taxation (GDT) said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The amount is equivalent to 105.06 per cent of the GDT’s revenue collection plan for the entire year.</p>
      <p>Last month, the GDT collected about $221.91 million in revenue, an increase of 21.85 per cent compared to October last year.</p>
      <p>GDT director-general Kong Vibol said the growth in tax revenue was due to the successful implementation of the e-VAT refund system – of which taxpayers and enterprises are well aware – as well as tax collection efforts of senior management and tax officials.</p>
      <p>Vibol advised all relevant departments to continue to strengthen law enforcement and work effectively.</p>
      <p>Speaking during a graduation ceremony for the Human Resource University on Monday, Prime Minister Hun Sen said Cambodia will exceed the more than $1 billion fiscal revenue target for this year.</p>
      <p>“During the first 10 months, taxation revenue has surpassed the plan by five per cent. It may be possible to collect a further $400-500 million over the remaining two months,” he said.</p>
      <p>Last year, the GDT collected more than $2.19 billion in tax revenue from various streams, up 13.37 per cent from 2017 – exceeding its target by more than $274 million, or about 14 per cent.</p>
