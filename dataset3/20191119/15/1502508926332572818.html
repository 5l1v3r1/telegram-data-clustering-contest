      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/siemens">Siemens </a>on Tuesday reported an 18.4 percent increase in consolidated net for the quarter to September at Rs 330.6 crore driven by higher revenue.</p>
      <p>The company, which follows the October-September fiscal year, said revenue from operations increased 5.7 percent to Rs 4,018 crore during the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>For the full year, its net income jumped 21.6 percent to Rs 1,087 crore on an revenue of Rs 13,323.1 crore, up 8.38 percent over the previous year.</p>
      <p>"The overall performance was very satisfactory despite a challenging market environment. Based on our visibility, we see muted capex spending in the next couple of quarters by both public and private sector companies," <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/siemens">Siemens </a>managing director Sunil Mathur said.</p>
      <p>Despite the slowdown, its gas &amp; power and digital industries businesses along with its smart infrastructure division, performed well during the year, and Mathur credited this for the initiatives taken across the verticals.</p>
      <p>"Our digitalisation initiatives continue to gain traction across all verticals and we are experiencing increased interest by our customers for our integrated digital solutions," he added.</p>
      <p>During the fourth quarter, the company booked new orders worth Rs 3,189 crore.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/siemens">Siemens </a>counter closed at Rs 1,576.90, up 1.53 percent on the BSE, as against a 0.46 percent rally in the benchmark Sensex.</p>
