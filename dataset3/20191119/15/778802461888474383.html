        <b>La vente d’une pièce commémorative de la restauration de Notre-Dame de Paris, en 1864, a rapporté 170’000 francs mardi soir à Genève. Les commissions seront reversées en faveur de la rénovation de l’édifice religieux.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Une pièce en or commémorant la fin de la restauration de Notre-Dame de Paris, en 1864, a atteint 170’000 francs lors de sa vente aux enchères à Genève mardi. Les commissions seront entièrement reversées aux futurs projets de rénovation.</p>
      <p>La vente était organisée par la société Numismatica Genevensis, qui soutient ainsi les efforts de reconstruction de la cathédrale, victime d’un violent incendie le 15 avril. Le prix de départ de la médaille était fixé à 50’000 francs. Il a atteint 170’000 francs, a indiqué la société à l’issue de la vente.</p>

      <p>La pièce, qui pèse 280,5 grammes et mesure 71 millimètres de diamètre, montre la façade occidentale de Notre-Dame, avec une vierge à l’enfant en avant-plan. Elle a probablement été donnée de la main de Napoléon III à l’architecte Viollet-le-Duc pour le remercier de son habileté lors de la restauration de la cathédrale en 1864.</p>
