      <h1>‘Half-Life: Alyx,’ Valve’s Flagship VR Game, Confirmed</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:39:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/jminor/" target="_blank">Jordan Minor</a></address>
      <p>Strap yourselves in for this emotional roller coaster. Valve has just announced a new <i>Half-Life</i> game. And it’s a virtual reality game. We’ll give you a few minutes to process that.</p>
      <p>But it’s true. Valve made a splashy Twitter debut by teasing <i>Half-Life: Alyx,</i> a “flagship VR game” set in its acclaimed iconic shooter franchise that’s been dormant for over a decade. And this Thursday we’ll finally get a look at the future of <i>Half-Life</i> through a screen strapped to our eyes.</p>

      <p>As big as this tease is, it’s still just a tease. So until Thursday all we can really do is feverishly speculate. The subtitle implies a focus on the character Alyx Vance rather than the main protagonist Gordon Freeman. Will it be the rumored prequel? Will it contain any of her storylines from the proposed <i><a href="https://www.geek.com/games/read-the-plot-of-half-life-2-episode-3-and-find-peace-1713598/">Episode 3</a></i>? Will it set the stage for <i>Episode 3</i>? Will it have <i>Portal</i> references? There are just too many quesitons!</p>
      <p>And those aren’t even gameplay questions. As a VR game, we have to imagine <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> is being used to promote Valve’s powerful <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/valve-index-is-a-powerful-vr-headset-even-without-half-life-1785153/">Valve Index</a> VR headset hardware. The <i>Half-Life</i> series is famous for pushing the boundaries of what single-player shooters can do. So what does that even mean in a VR context, a format where brief novelty experiences are arguably more palatable than lengthy uncomfortable campaigns.</p>
      <p>Also, is Valve is even capable of making single-player games like they used to? The company has been so laser-focused on <i>Dota 2</i> and Steam marketplaces for years that they’ve felt irrelevant as a game developer. Plus we’ve heard unfortunate rumors about the talented folks who’ve essentially disappeared into the company. Remember<i> In The Valley of the Gods</i>?</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, at least we can say “<i>Half-Life</i> confirmed,” and that does feel weirdly satisfying.</p>
