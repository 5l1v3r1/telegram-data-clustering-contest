        <b>Ireland fans criticised those who took part in a chant aimed at Christian Eriksen during Ireland's 1-1 Euro 2020 qualifying draw with Denmark at the Aviva Stadium last night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ireland put in a great performance but ultimately fell just short of qualification, with the play-offs to come.</p>
      <p>Denmark's star man Eriksen didn't have a great game but some fans felt chants aimed at him during the game were a step too far.</p>
      <p>They stemmed from rumours about an affair between Eriksen's partner and his Tottenham teammate <a href="https://www.buzz.ie/football/eriksen-rumour-partner-vertonghen-339159"><i>Jan Vertonghen</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Eriksen subsequently rubbished the rumour but he was targeted with chants of "Jan Vertonghen, he's shagging your wife".</p>

      <p>While a large number of Irish fans took part, they've been criticised by others who felt it was out of order.</p>
