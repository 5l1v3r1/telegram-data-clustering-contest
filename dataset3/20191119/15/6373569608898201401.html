      <p>Plymouth Raiders suffered a difficult weekend as they went down to back-to back defeats over the weekend.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Raiders struggled as they lost 92-101 to London City Royals and the following day, Raiders were beaten 77-87 by the Surrey Scorchers.</p>
      <p>Against the Royals, there were excellent performances from Rashad Hassan and Ron Mvouika, on his Raiders debut, but it was not enough as the hosts fought back taking them further into the BBL Southern Group Cup.</p>
      <p>Raiders lined up with Jackson Hyland, Kostas Jonuska, Rashad Hassan, Tyrell Johnson and Josh Wilcher.</p>

      <p>Johnson won the tip for Raiders, but a close first quarter ended 27-25 to the Royals.</p>
      <p>However, they managed to turn things round in the second and went in at the end of the session holding a narrow one-point advantage.</p>
      <p>A strong start to the third from the Royals saw Raiders lose their lead and a three-point shot by Lawrence put the hosts seven points ahead at one stage. Further shots for Raiders ended the third quarter 70-73 to the Royals.</p>

      <p>The fourth quarter saw a ball by Hyland level the scores at 90-90 with only two minutes remaining of the game. However, shots by Jackman then gave Royals a seven-point lead which unfortunately Raiders could not escape.</p>
      <p>Mvouika made the last shot for Raiders, and the final score was 92-101, with Royals taking another win.</p>
      <p>Rashad Hassan put on a great performance, against the Scorchers, scoring twenty-three points making him the second highest scorer.</p>
      <p>Josh Wilcher also came out on top with a huge eleven assists and Kostas Jonuska with the highest number of steals for Raiders.</p>
      <p>However, it was a dominant first quarter as the Scorchers stormed into a nine-point lead, ending the session 22-13.</p>
      <p>After a slow start to the second quarter, the Scorchers took control and at the end of the first half, they led 50-29, a huge 21-point lead.</p>
      <p>Raiders enjoyed an excellent third period, as they managed to reduce the deficit to just eight points, but no sooner had they got within touching distance than the Scorchers pulled clear again to lead by 12 points heading into the fourth quarter.</p>
      <p>That gap was reduced to six at one stage, but this did not remain for long as the Scorchers went on to win 87-77.</p>
      <p>Raiders continue the action on December 6 as they begin their league campaign away to the Leicester Riders.</p>
