      <p>Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) is set to provide funding to deal with Ballina’s traffic congestion problems.</p>
      <p>It follows a meeting with TII yesterday by a delegation representing Mayo County Council.</p>
      <p>Councillor Annie May Reape, a member of the delegation, stated: “We have received confirmation that Mayo County Council has applied for a number of Minor Works Grants for the N26 Foxford to Ballina route, and one of those schemes, which will link the N26 Foxford Road to the N59 Crossmolina Road, is earmarked for initial funding in 2020.</p>
      <p>“This is significant news for Ballina and particularly for those people who experience traffic congestion on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>“We had a very constructive meeting with TII officials ysterday in Dublin and news that initial funding will be available to start the process of linking the N26 to the N59 is very welcome.</p>
      <p>“There is also good news in relation to N26 Cloongullane Bridge which is progressing with tender documentation to be issued by Mid December.”</p>
