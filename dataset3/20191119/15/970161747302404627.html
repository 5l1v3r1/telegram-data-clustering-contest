      <p>With less than a month to go until the general election on 12 December, its time to analyse exactly what each party is promising to deliver on.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> is the key election issue likely to influence who voters choose to back, but major issues like the NHS, crime, the economy and the climate crisis could certainly swing the vote.</p>
      <p>So who is promising what?</p>
      <h3>Conservatives</h3>

      </figure>
      <p><b>On Brexit:</b> Boris Johnson has repeatedly said he is the man to ‘get Brexit done’ despite failing to do so as promised on his initial Halloween Brexit date.</p>
      <p>He wants to leave the EU as soon as possible with the revised deal he has already agreed with EU leaders.</p>
      <p>But Mr Johnson was forced to write a letter asking the EU for a second Brexit extension until the end of January when MPs failed to approve the timescale he wanted to rush his deal through parliament in three days.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The PM secured changes to the deal previously negotiated by Theresa May by scrapping the Irish backstop and replacing it with a new customs arrangement.</p>
      <p>The backstop had become a sticking point between those who wanted to protect the peace agreement on the island of Ireland and those who wanted a ‘clean break’ from the EU.</p>
      <p>The party was split over Mr Johnson’s handling of Brexit, with 21 MPs expelled for refusing to toe the government’s line and vote for Mr Johnson’s deal. Ten have since been welcomed back so they can run as Tory candidates in the upcoming election.</p>
      <p><b>On Climate Change: </b>The Conservatives have pledged to meet net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>
      <p>The party has promised to create a new Office for Environmental Protection and set binding targets on air pollution and charges for plastic use.</p>
      <p>Tories also say they will plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 and have called a halt to fracking.</p>
      <p><b>On the NHS: </b>The Tories have pledged £20.5 billion in additional funding for the NHS in England by 2024.</p>
      <p>The party says it will spend £2.7 billion on six new hospitals and has plans for 34 more, as well as pledging a £1.8 billion cash injection for 20 current hospitals up and down England.</p>
      <p>It says it will train 6,000 more GPs in England by 2025 and 6,000 more nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists in surgeries.</p>
      <p>The Tories also want to develop a new long-term plan for social care with cross-party support.</p>
      <p><b>Other key points: </b>The Tories have promised to recruit 20,000 extra police officers in England and Wales over the next three years to fight violent street crime.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>It has also pledged tougher sentences for violent and sexual offenders, as well as those who commit animal cruelty.</p>
      <h3>Labour</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/PRI_96984610.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1"/>
        <figcaption>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn thinks its all going well at an election campaign event in Lancaster (Picture: Getty)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>On Brexit: </b>Labour want to renegotiate Mr Johnson’s deal with the EU before putting it back to the public in a second Brexit referendum within six months.</p>
      <p>Leader Jeremy Corbyn says the referendum would be a choice between a ‘credible’ Leave option or Remain, so could lead to cancelling Brexit.</p>
      <p>In its deal, the party says it will negotiate for the UK to remain in an EU customs union and retain a ‘close’ single market relationship with the bloc.</p>
      <p>This would allow the UK to continue trading with the EU without checks, but it would prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has not said which way he would vote in a second referendum and has been accused by Mr Johnson of ‘ducking’ the question.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader has pledged ‘to carry out whatever the people decide’ after a second vote.</p>
      <p>The party has been crushed by internal divisions over Brexit, with Labour voters split between Leave and Remain.</p>
      <p>In June, 25 Labour MPs wrote to Mr Corbyn saying another referendum would be ‘toxic to our bedrock Labour voters’.</p>
      <p><b>On Climate Change: </b>Labour says it will meet net-zero carbon emissions by 2030.</p>
      <p>Under its ‘green industrial revolution’ the party has pledged to create 320,000 apprenticeships within renewable industries during its first term in office.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>It says it will lift the ban on new onshore wind farms and invest in new solar, tidal and wind energy.</p>
      <p>It will also upgrade almost all of the UK’s 27 million homes to the highest energy efficiency standards possible, Labour says.</p>
      <p>Drivers will be offered interest-free loans on electric cars, the party has said.</p>
      <p><b>On the NHS: </b>Labour has announced a plan to increase the NHS budget by £26 billion by 2024.</p>
      <p>It will do this by increasing taxes on the richest in society, chancellor John McDonnell said.</p>
      <p>The party has said it will focus on cutting waiting times and boosting mental health services, offering free personal social care for over-65s, free prescriptions and a new state-run pharmaceutical company to make drugs available at affordable prices.</p>
      <p>It also wants to train a new generation of GPs – increase training places from 3,500 to 5,000.</p>
      <p>Labour has also said it will scrap hospital car parking charges in England.</p>
      <p><b>Other key points: </b>Labour has promised to raise the minimum wage to a ‘real’ living wage of £10-an-hour for all workers aged 16 and over, from 2020.</p>
      <p>It also wants to scrap Universal Credit and the so-called “bedroom tax” and end the freeze on working-age benefits, as well as pledging a 32-hour working week by the end of the next decade.</p>
      <h3>Liberal Democrats</h3>

      <p><b>On Brexit: </b>The Lib Dems want Brexit cancelled.</p>
      <p>The Remain party’s leader Jo Swinson has said a Lib Dem majority government would cancel Brexit.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>If they don’t get a majority, she said they would support a second referendum, with an option to Remain in the EU.</p>
      <p>The policy was endorsed in September by party members at the Lib Dem party conference.</p>
      <p><b>On Climate Change: </b>The Lib Dems say they will spend £20 billion a year for five years to tackle climate change.</p>
      <p>It has pledged to generate 80% of the UK’s electricity from renewable energy by 2030 and to ban fracking.</p>
      <p>The party will ensure that all new cars and small vans bought in 2030 are electric and will plant 60 million trees a year by 2025.</p>
      <p><b>On the NHS: </b>The Lib Dems has said they will <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/lib-dems-say-put-income-tax-fund-35000000000-nhs-plan-11181065/">put up income tax by </a>1p which they claim will give the NHS a £35 billion boost.</p>
      <p>The party has promised to spend more on health and social care with a focus on mental health, public health and staff shortages.</p>
      <p>Mental and physical health will be treated with equal importance, the party has said.</p>
      <p>Access to GPs will be improved and the party wants to implement a strategy to tackle childhood obesity.</p>

      <p><b>On Brexit: </b>Nigel Farage wants to leave the EU without a deal in what his Brexit Party calls a ‘clean-break Brexit’.</p>
      <p>He has repeatedly said Mr Johnson’s deal is a bad deal and ‘not Brexit’ because it would still involve paying the EU a £39 billion settlement to leave.</p>
      <p>The party said it would be willing to form an electoral pact – or a ‘Leave Alliance’ – with the Conservatives to try to avoid splitting the leave vote.</p>
      <p>Mr Farage pulled candidates out of 317 Tory safe seats in the second week of the election campaign for this very reason.</p>

        <figcaption>DUP leader Arlene Foster during the party’s annual conference at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Belfast (Picture: PA)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p><b>On Brexit: </b>Northern Ireland’s DUP opposes Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal and if the DUP retain their 10 seats in the election, they could be crucial in the formation of the next British government.</p>
      <p>Despite being against the PM’s deal, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she would not consider supporting a government led by Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
      <p>The DUP has long been hostile to Mr Corbyn because of his sympathy with Irish nationalists Sinn Fein and their goal of cutting Northern Ireland’s ties with London and joining a united Irish state.</p>
      <p>The DUP struck a confidence-and-supply agreement with the Conservatives when it lost its majority in the Commons in the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>It meant the party lent its support in the Commons to allow the Tories to form a government.</p>
      <p>But the DUP has said it is unhappy with Mr Johnson’s revised deal and wanted to be given a veto, so that it had the option to reject the new customs arrangement in the future.</p>
      <p>It is worried that the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK could be threatened, because Northern Ireland would have to stick to some EU rules and there would be checks on goods coming from Great Britain.</p>
      <p><b>On Climate Change: </b>The DUP’s top priorities for the environment are to encourage the uptake of environmental farming schemes and support farmers to tackle environmental challenges.</p>
      <p>It says it will support policies which protect and enhance the environment, including the sustainable land management strategy.</p>
      <p>The DUP aims to withdraw from the Common Fisheries Policy and establish a single coastal management department to overhaul Northern Ireland’s 50-year-old protection framework.</p>
      <p><b>On the NHS: </b>The DUP has vowed to increase spending on health by at least £1 billion to tackle waiting lists and invest in innovation and reform.</p>
      <p>It also wants to employ at least 1,500 more nurses and midwives and 200 more consultants and have 110 GPs a year in training by 2020.</p>
      <p>The party has pledged an increase spending on mental health and to raise investment in cancer care by at least 10%.</p>
      <p><b>Other points: </b>The party has promised more and better jobs through extra powers and city deals for all of Northern Ireland.</p>
