      <p>A decorated US Army veteran blasted <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>’s ‘reprehensible’ attacks on him as he told an impeachment hearing of Trump’s ‘inappropriate’ behavior.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, the National Security Council’s top Ukraine specialist, defended himself and other witnesses during his opening statement at the US Capitol in Washington DC Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Vindman, who was branded a ‘Never Trumper’ by the President earlier this morning told the House Intelligence Committee: ‘The character attacks on these distinguished public servants is reprehensible.</p>
      <p>‘We are better than personal attacks.</p>
      <p>‘The uniform I wear today is that of a US army.</p>

      <p>Vindman, an Iraq veteran awarded the Purple Heart for bravery, was joined by Jennifer Williams, a foreign service aide who worked alongside Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
      <p>And both expressed concerns about Trump’s July 25 call with newly-elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky which sparked impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>Trump is accused of withholding $400million in ‘security assistance’ until Ukraine opened an investigation into political rival Joe Biden’s son Hunter, and Hunter Biden’s role on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma. Ex-Vice President Biden is one of the front-runners to stand against Trump in the 2020 presidential election.</p>
      <p>That cash was delayed, with Williams told the hold-up was due to a check to ensure it was in line with the policies of the Trump administration.</p>

      <p>The president is also said to have dangled the prospect of a prized trip to the White House for Zelensky in return for opening the desired investigation.</p>
      <p>He is alleged to have abused his office to further his own political standing, with both Trump and Hunter Biden denying any wrongdoing.</p>
      <p>Recalling his immediate reaction to the July 25 call, which he listened in on, Vindman said: ‘It was inappropriate.</p>
      <p>‘It was improper for the president to demand an investigation into a political opponent, especially of a foreign power where there’s at best dubious belief that this would be an impartial investigation.’</p>
      <p>Williams, who also listened on the call, said she found it ‘unusual,’ saying: ‘In contrast with other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a (US) domestic political matter.’</p>

      <p>Vindman explained to the hearing that had Ukraine opened the Biden investigation, it would have undermined bipartisan (cross-party US) support for the country’s new regime.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>The US has high hopes for Zelensky’s pledge to tackle corruption in his country.</p>
      <p>But Vindman said asking the new president him investigate a Trump rival could seriously harm the standing of both the Ukraine and the United States.</p>
      <p>And he disputed claims that Trump’s call with Zelensky represented a casual request for a favor.</p>
      <p>He highlighted the power disparity between the US president and his Ukrainian counterpart, saying: ‘The military culture I come from, when a senior asks you to do something, even when polite and pleasant, its not to be taken as a request. its to be taken as an order.’</p>
      <p>He immediately reported his concerns to the National Security Council. The security assistance promised to Ukraine was released in September.</p>
      <p>He had previously reported US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland’s alleged July 10 proposal to the Ukraine that it should open several investigations on behalf of Trump.</p>
      <p>Trump was accused of smearing Vindman with Tuesday morning’s tweet, which said: ‘Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call ‘concerned’ today’s Never Trumper witness.</p>
      <p>‘Was he on the same call that I was? Can’t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!’</p>
      <p>Impeachment hearings are set to continue all week, with the procedure’s most anticipated witness Gordon Sondland set to face questions on Wednesday.</p>
      <h3>Impeachment explained</h3>
      <p>Donald Trump is the fourth president in United States history to face an impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Impeachment is the constitutional process that gives Congress the authority to accuse the president of wrongdoing and may result in the removal of a president before his or her four-year term has ended.</p>
      <p>The articles of impeachment are the list of charges brought against the president and the Constitution lists ‘treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors’ as justifications for the proceedings – however the vague wording of the third option has caused confusion in the past.</p>
      <p>The United States Congress is made up of two chambers, the House of Representatives, commonly referred to as ‘the House’, (435 members allotted to states by population) and the Senate (100 members/2 per state).</p>
      <p>The process begins in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of Congress, where any member may make a formal suggestion to launch impeachment proceedings to allege wrongdoing by the president.</p>
      <p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, announced the formal opening of an impeachment inquiry on September 24</p>
      <p>She accused the president of ‘betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security, and betrayal of the integrity of our elections’ regarding Trump’s public admission that he asked Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelekskiy to investigate the son of presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
      <p>The full House voted to authorize the inquiry on October 31.</p>
      <p>In this current impeachment, inquiry, the House Intelligence Committee was then tasked with investigating Trump and the allegations against him.</p>
      <p>The House Intelligence Committee is the primary committee in the US House of Representatives charged with the oversight of the US Intelligence Community and is led by Democrat Adam Schiff.</p>
      <p>After concluding their investigation, the House Intelligence Committee will then turn the matter over to the Judiciary Committee (24 Democrats, 17 Republicans), which could draw up the articles of impeachment, equivalent to charges.</p>
      <p>Each article of impeachment is then voted on by the committee and – if the Judiciary Committee approves an article with a majority in favor – they are passed along to the full House of Representatives to be voted on.</p>
      <p>If any of the articles are gets a simple majority vote by the full House of Representatives, then the president would be impeached.</p>
      <p>Democrats currently control the House of Representatives and could therefore vote to impeach without any Republican support.</p>
      <p>However, a president may still continue governing after he or she is impeached by the House of Representatives.</p>
      <p>For example, Bill Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in December 1998, but continued to finish his second term in January 2001. The impeachment had no official or legal ramifications, but it did damage his legacy.</p>
      <p>In impeachment proceedings, the House of Representatives acts as the prosecutors and the Senate acts as the jurors.</p>
      <p>After the House rules to impeach of federal official, the Senate then holds a trial, but they cannot be forced to do so.</p>
      <p>Republicans in the Senate have so far given little indication that they would decide to proceed with a trial. If the Senate does hold a trial, a two-thirds vote (67) is required to remove the president from office.</p>
      <p>If the Senate fails to convict the president, he or she is impeached but not removed, which was the case with Clinton.</p>
      <p>The Senate has the power to remove the president, but not to send him or her to jail. The president may later face criminal charges.</p>
