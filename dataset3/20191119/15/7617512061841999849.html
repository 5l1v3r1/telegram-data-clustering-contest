      <h1>B.C. Transit bus trips potentially cancelled in Greater Victoria on Tuesday afternoon</h1>

      <p>B.C. Transit says two trip could be potentially cancelled on Tuesday afternoon:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No. 75 leaving Saanichton Exchange at 3:20 p.m.</li>
        <li>No. 47 leaving Government at Superior at 4:42 p.m.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For more information, go to B.C. Transit's <a href="https://www.bctransit.com/victoria/schedules-and-maps/alerts">advisory page</a>.</p>
      <p>The transit system was plagued with cancellations in September and October as mechanics struggled to keep Victoria’s aging fleet on the road.</p>
      <p>B.C. Transit borrowed seven buses from Abbotsford and Kelowna in an attempt to prevent trip cancellations on Greater Victoria routes.</p>
      <p>The two-year-old buses — four from Abbotsford and three from Kelowna — were hoped to help improve the reliability of bus service, according Kevin Schubert, general manager of B.C. Transit’s Victoria operation.</p>
      <p>B.C. Transit is still delivering more than 99 per cent of its scheduled services every day, which includes 3,200 trips on weekdays, according to spokesman Jonathon Dyck.</p>
      <p>There are 302 buses in the fleet, based in Victoria and Langford.</p>
      <p>B.C. Transit’s Victoria operation saw an almost 10 per cent increase in ridership in September, year-over-year. Ridership on the No. 50 bus from the West Shore to downtown Victoria has jumped 44 per cent in five years.</p>
      <p>In 2020 there will be 80 new buses, which will reduce the average fleet age from 12 years to six years. A significant percentage of the new buses will operate on compressed natural gas. Ten electric buses are scheduled to arrive in 2021.</p>
      <p>The borrowed buses from Abbotsford and Kelowna will be returned when Victoria’s new buses arrive.</p>
