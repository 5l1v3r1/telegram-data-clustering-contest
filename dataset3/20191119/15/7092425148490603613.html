      <p>Former Game Of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke has admitted she was pressured to perform nude scenes early on, despite being highly uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Clarke reveals GOT bosses told her if she refused to take part in nude scenes she would "disappoint" fans of the show.</p>
      <p>The revelations come in an interview the 33-year-old had with Dax Shepard on his <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/emilia-clarke">Armchair Expert</a> podcast.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the podcast host she said:</p>
      <p>“I’m a lot more savvy with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, ‘No, the sheet stays up’, and they’re like, ‘You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans’. And I’m like, ‘F**k you.'”</p>
      <p>In the first season of GOT Clarke describes the level of nudity as a "f**k ton of nudity", to which she felt overwhelmed by.</p>

      <p>She also said that when she joined the show back in 2011 she was only out of drama school. As she was only starting out she felt like she had no other option.</p>
      <p>"I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was, like, 'Oh, there's the catch!'" she recalls.</p>
      <p>Clarke continued: “So I came to terms with that beforehand, but then going in and doing it… I’m floating through this first season and I have no idea what I’m doing, I have no idea what any of this is.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been on a film set like this before, I’d been on a film set twice before then, and I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do and I don’t know what’s expected of me, and I don’t know what you want and I don’t know what I want.”</p>

      <p>The actress then went on to explain it was Jason Momoa, her lover Khal Drogo in GOT, who made her open her eyes to how much power she had in reality.</p>
      <p>"It was definitely hard," she said. "Which is why the scenes, when I got to do them with Jason, were wonderful, because he was like, 'No, sweetie, this isn't OK.' And I was like, 'Ohhhh.'"</p>
      <p>Emilia is now starring in festive flick Last Christmas which is currently in cinemas.</p>
