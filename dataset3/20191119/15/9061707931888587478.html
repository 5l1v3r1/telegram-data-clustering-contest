      <h1>Athletics: How hurdler Jess Turner's season went from despair to world class</h1>
      <h2>Derby Telegraph Sportswoman of the Year found her form to lower PB and reach semis in World Athletics Championships</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:34:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:34</time> by <a rel="author">Colston Crawford</a></address>
      <p>Jess Turner was crowned Sportswoman of the Year at the Derby Telegraph Sports Awards last week – but admitted she could not have envisaged an award of any kind at the start of the last athletics season.</p>
      <p>The season ended with the 24-year-old 400m hurdler from Denby reaching the semi-finals in the World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, and narrowly missing out on a medal in the 400m relay.</p>
      <p>But at the start of the summer, she could barely put a foot right on the track and, in a despairing Instagram post, had suggested the season was a write-off.</p>
      <p>That was a surprise because she had been improving steadily for several years, winning a silver medal at the European Under-23 Championships in 2017, the same year that she made her first World Championships appearance.</p>
      <p>Suddenly, she was faced with missing out on the 2019 World Championships, her main target for the year. However, what followed was a complete turnaround, which she attributes to the skills of her experienced coach, Nick Dakin.</p>
      <p>“At the start of the season, it wasn’t happening. I was two or three seconds slow and I couldn’t understand why because my training had gone well and I’d stayed injury-free, done everything I was supposed to,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Halfway through the season, I went to my coach and said ‘I don’t know what’s happening, it’s just not going right’ and he said, ‘let’s just start again. Let’s refresh, get rid of all that negativity and start again.’</p>
      <p>“Literally, right after that, every race was just getting better and better.”</p>
      <p>In Berne, Switzerland, on August 3, Turner ran under 56 seconds for the first time, clocking 55.95 for her event. It was not only a long-time target to break the 56-second barrier but a time which qualified her for the World Championships.</p>

      <p>In Doha, she lowered her personal best again, by a chunk, to 55.72 seconds, to reach the semi-finals. In the 400m relay, the British quartet came fourth and thought they had a medal when Jamaica were disqualified. But the Jamaicans were reinstated on appeal and the medal was snatched away again.</p>
      <p>“My coach definitely got it just right, I peaked at just the right time and I was thrilled with how it went in Doha,” said Turner. “Being so close to getting a relay medal has just made us hungrier, really, to get something in Tokyo at the Olympics (next year).”</p>
      <p>While she was at Loughborough University, up to a couple of years ago, Turner was able to compete as virtually a full-time athlete. Now she wrestles daily with the conundrum hundreds of athletes have, unless they reach a level at which sponsors come flocking. She has to make a living to fund her training, while finding enough time to train and compete.</p>
      <p>“It still is super-difficult, financially,” she admitted. “I am struggling. I am not getting any sponsorships or funding, no financial help whatsoever, so everything I do comes out of my own pocket.</p>
      <p>“I do try to work as much as I can so that I can afford to go abroad for races, where most of my races are. I do most of my training at Loughborough, some at Derby University. It is a lot of pressure and I have had to make a lot of sacrifices. I’ve sacrificed a paying career, really, for what I do, but I don’t regret it.”</p>
      <p>On top of that, a further challenge is that powers that be in athletics keep making the qualifying times for major events harder. Turner already runs fast enough to have qualified for the 2016 Rio Olympics, had she been old enough at the time.</p>
      <p>She is likely to go to Tokyo with the relay team, as they already have a qualifying time, but the next target is to qualify in her specialist event, something she will hope to do early in the next outdoor season.</p>
      <p>“They keep making the qualifying harder, which is so frustrating,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I’m there – and then they move the goalposts again. They’ve made it more than half a second harder. It’s frustrating but I’m so, so close to it and I know I can do it. I’ve come this far and that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>
      <p>Next to representing Great Britain all over the world several times already, you might think being named Sportswoman of the Year in her own county was a relatively minor success. But the modest Turner was thrilled.</p>
      <p>“I’m so, so happy,” she said after her name was read out at the awards. “My heart was beating so fast and I’m so thrilled to win this – really, really happy.”</p>
