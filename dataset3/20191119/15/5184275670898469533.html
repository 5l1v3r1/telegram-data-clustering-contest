        <b>Tum Hi Aana (Marjaavaan)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Featuring the leads – Sidharth and Tara, the song shows a grief-desolated Sidharth Malhotra remembering the fond memories of Tara Sutaria while he is in jail. The video shows how the two lovebirds spent winsome time with each other and everything slowly destroying for them. The song alternates between the past and the present. The song outlines how their love story ends with Raghu eventually murdering Zoya at the end of the song and that will surely pique your anticipation about the storyline of the film.</p>

        <b>Shaitan Ka Saala (Housefull 4)</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shaitaan Ka Saala is like an introductory song for Akshay Kumar which features the actor in a hilarious 1419 avatar as ‘Raavan’. The song showcases Akshay Kumar’s 1419 version with his father being a king seeming to be tired of his womanizer habits. Bala ‘Shaitan Ka Saala’ in the entire song is having a gala time around girls. There are some hilarious moments with Akshay’s tremendous expressions, a glimpse of Kriti Sanon. The song is filled with entertainment and we’re sure that Housefull 4 is going to be ’10 times more’ entertaining as promised by the makers.</p>
