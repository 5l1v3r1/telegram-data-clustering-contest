      <p>In Argentina's 1-0 win over Brazil in an international friendly last Friday, Tite and Messi exchanged some heated words after the Selecao manager thought the 32-year-old should have been booked for a foul.</p>
      <p>Days later, Tite has responded to comparisons between the Argentina captain and Brazil icon Pele, insisting that not even the Catalan club forward has reached the levels the 79-year-old did.</p>
      <p>"Messi better than Pele? Pele is incomparable," he said, according to <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"Anyone who wants to compare Pele with another athlete knows nothing.</p>
      <p>"Messi is extraordinary, but within humans. Pele is outside humans, is outside normal parameters.</p>
      <p>"I do not say this because I am Brazilian, I say it because I saw that story, the magnitude of Pele, his plays, the individual technique, the header, ambidextrous, his strength, his impulse.</p>
      <p>"If you want to find a defect, you will not find it."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Tite then suggested that Messi also lacks the personality Pele had.</p>
      <p>"As if that were not enough, Pele had an extraordinary charisma," he added.</p>
      <p>"What happened with Messi the other day, I just called for a yellow and he told me to shut up."</p>

      <p>Messi scored his 70th goal for Argentina in their 2-2 draw with Uruguay on Monday night, and is now seven goals behind Pele's all-time South American goalscoring record.</p>
