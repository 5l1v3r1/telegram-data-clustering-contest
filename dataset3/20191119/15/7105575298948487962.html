        <li>It looks like an outtake: Duff and another actor are laughing, and Duff wears a very covetable Lisa Frank tee that I want right now.</li>

      <hr/>
      <p>Just days after Hilary Duff officially debuted her old-but-new Lizzie McGuire bangs (less blunt, more choppy, wispy, a perfect update) she just gave us a still shot that might be <i>actual footage from the show</i>. Excuse me while I go freak out for a second.</p>
      <p>Technically it's two images, maybe of the same scene shot from different angles: In one, Duff as Lizzie is standing in a super-cute Lisa Frank tee with a rainbow heart—be still my little middle school heart! In the other, you only catch the edge of it, but it looks like a slightly older woman wearing a black top and a ponytail and sitting down at a kitchen table. Lizzie's mom used to wear her hair up in crazy 'dos so maybe that's her?? It looks like an outtake—Duff is laughing delightedly. As I put on my sleuth hat for one second, the kitchen looks quite similar to the one on the original show, but with different-colored walls and a table instead of a countertop (lord knows this could also be a totally different house, but wouldn't it be amazing if it were the same set??).</p>
      <p>Duff captioned the photo, "Somebody wake me.. #lizziemcguire" and is clearly as delighted as we all are that her most memorable character is officially back. Here's the image:</p>

      <p>And here are the bangs:</p>

      <p>Looking great, Lizzie.</p>
