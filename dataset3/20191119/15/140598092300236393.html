      <h1>Gems and jewellery worth £2 million taken in Hampstead burglary</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:56:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/martin-evans/" target="_blank">Martin Evans</a></address>
      <p>Police are hunting a gang of burglars who stole jewellery and cash estimated at more than £2 million after forcing their way into  a mansion in one of London's most exclusive neighbourhoods.</p>
      <p>The victim, a mother in her 30s, was at home with her children in Hampstead when intruders climbed over a garden wall and entered the house through a bedroom window.</p>
      <p>They then began searching the large detached home before making off with an array of rare jewellery, designer clothing as well as a substantial amount of cash.</p>
      <p>Describing the raid, the victim, who asked not to be identified, said the gang were afraid of nothing as they ransacked the master bedroom, making off with diamonds, bangles, earrings, and rings.</p>
      <p>She said: "They came through a second floor window - through the children’s bedroom - and came across the floor to the master bedroom.</p>
      <p>“They climbed up the wall to the balcony and went round the side to the window.</p>
      <p>"They locked themselves in the master bedroom and they couldn’t get out so they broke down the door onto the balcony to get away. We were all in the house at the time.</p>
      <p>She said the raid has left the family "shaken and fearful".</p>

      <p>“They just grabbed everything. They took the jewellery and even some shoes. They did everything quickly - it took 30 minutes maximum."</p>
      <p>As well the enormous financial loss, she said the items had huge sentimental value.</p>
      <p>She added: "One ring was from when I had one of my children so it has sentimental value.</p>
      <p>"It was all worth around £2 million and wasn't insured.</p>
      <p>“We don’t know who these people were or how they work. And we're now careful when the children walk to school."</p>

      <p>Appealing for help to catch the gang, Detective Inspector Paul Ridley, from Scotland Yard, said: </p>
      <p>“Burglary is an extremely intrusive crime and the effect is often compounded further when the occupants are at home. </p>
      <p>“This is an aggravating feature of this case as the victim was present with her young children when the burglars have forced entry, scaling the wall of the mansion and brazenly ransacking the premises.”</p>

      <p>Police have released images of the stolen jewellery to help their investigation. </p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Ridley added: “I am today releasing images of some of the items that were stolen and are of huge sentimental value to the victim.</p>
      <p>“I would ask anyone who has been offered this jewellery, including private collectors or jewellers; or seen these items for sale anywhere to report it to us immediately.</p>
      <p>“I can assure you that all information will be treated in confidence and will be acted upon by my investigation team – I need the names of these intruders as a priority.”</p>
