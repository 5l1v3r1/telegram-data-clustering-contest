      <p>Kyle Van Noy hears everything.</p>
      <p>Following the team’s 17-10 win over the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday, the New England Patriots linebacker reacted to what he felt was a dig against the Patriots.</p>
      <p>During the second half at Lincoln Financial Field, CBS broadcaster Tony Romo complimented the Patriots defense but said they were doing this by having relatively “no-name” players.</p>
      <p>Word got back to Van Noy and he fired back on Twitter:</p>

      <p>To be fair, outside of Patriots fans, not many fans around the league can name more than 2 players on that defense. That don’t seem to care as they continue to dominate.</p>
      <p>After going down 10-0 in the 2nd quarter against the Eagles, that vaunted Pats defense didn’t allow another point for the remainder of the game.</p>
