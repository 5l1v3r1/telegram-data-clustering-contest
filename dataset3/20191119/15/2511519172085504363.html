      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>’s personal physician, Navy commander Sean Conley, has written a letter insisting the president’s unannounced Saturday visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, was “a routine, planned interim checkup”.</p>
      <p>“Despite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,” Commander Conley wrote in his statement, issued by the White House in a bid to dispel rumours that a more serious health complaint was being covered up.</p>
      <p>Four key witnesses are due to appear before the House <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> on Tuesday to testify on the Ukraine scandal – <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jennifer-williams">Jennifer Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kurt-volker">Kurt Volker</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tim-morrison">Tim Morrison</a> – after the US Supreme Court blocked the release of Mr Trump’s tax returns to Congress.</p>

        <p>"Without hesitation, I knew I had to report this to the White House counsel," he said. "It was my duty to report my concerns ... It was inappropriate, it was improper for the president to demand an investigation into a political opponent."</p>

Prior to July 25th, I had participated in roughly a dozen other presidential phone calls. During my closed-door deposition, Members of the Committee asked about my personal views and whether I had any concerns about the July 25th call. As I testified then, I found the July 25th phone call unusual because, in contrast to other presidential calls I had observed, it involved discussion of what appeared to be a domestic political matter."</i></p>
