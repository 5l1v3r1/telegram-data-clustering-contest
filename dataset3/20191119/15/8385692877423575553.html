      <p>Best Buy has a pretty <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">amazing</a> bundle right now for the Fire TV Stick. Where you can bundle the Amazon Fire TV Stick, the Echo Dot and the TP-Link Mini Smart Plug for just $41.99.</p>
      <p>Amazon is currently bundling the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Echo Dot for $46. So with Best Buy, you're saving $5 and getting a free smart plug. That's not bad at all.</p>
      <p>To get this deal, you'll need to add the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Famazon-fire-tv-stick-with-all-new-alexa-voice-remote-streaming-media-player-black%2F6321069.p%3Fref%3D8575135%26loc%3De62bd4440ad911eaa00102fafdfe01860INT%26acampID%3De62bd4440ad911eaa00102fafdfe01860INT%26skuId%3D6321069">Fire TV Stick</a> to your cart, and then add the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/334843/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Famazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa-charcoal%2F6287974.p%3Fref%3D8575135%26loc%3D963ab8820ada11ea97086e29dea6a24e0INT%26acampID%3D963ab8820ada11ea97086e29dea6a24e0INT%26skuId%3D6287974">Echo Dot</a> to your cart.

      <p>The Fire TV Stick is a really great dongle to pick up and add to your TV. This one does not support 4K, it does do up to 1080p resolution, which is still going to be pretty good looking. And if you have a TV that doesn't support 4K, then this Fire TV Stick is going to be great for it.</p>
      <p>Fire TV Stick does have all of the apps and games that you'd expect. That includes Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Disney+ and so much more.</p>
      <p>The Echo Dot has Alexa built-in, as you might expect, and it can control the Fire TV Stick and the TP-Link Smart Plug Mini. Making this bundle really awesome. Alexa is able to answer your questions, as well as controlling your smart home devices. Of course, it can also stream music since it is a speaker. Most music streaming services work with Alexa, but if you happen to have one that doesn't, there is still Bluetooth compatibility.</p>
