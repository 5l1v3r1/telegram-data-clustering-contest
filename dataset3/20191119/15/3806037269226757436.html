      <h1>Hanzo &amp; SEANTHOMMONEY Link for Energetic "Complicated" Visual</h1>
      <h2>The Awful Records-signee details his projects for the year ahead.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:00:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:00</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p>Newly-signed <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/awful-records">Awful Records</a> producer-meets-rapper <a href="https://www.instagram.com/holdmyhanzo/?hl=en">Hanzo</a> has teamed up with labelmate <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seanthommoney/?hl=en">SEANTHOMMONEY</a> for a laid back new visual for their recently released single “Complicated.” First entering the scene producing a variety of hit tracks for the likes of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lil-pump">Lil Pump</a>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/hoodrich-pablo-juan">Hoodrich Pablo Juan</a>, and <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/6-dogs">6 Dogs</a>, Atlanta-native Hanzo is now stepping out as a solo act, mandating a career at the forefront of his own productions. The track sees both honing in on their sad boy-tinged lyricism, floating over playful chord progressions and trappy 808s.</p>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deadpicasso/?hl=en">Diégo Freitez</a>-directed visual, both Awful artists can be seen vibing out in a variety of locations from the studio to the streets. In a recent statement to HYPEBEAST, Hanzo shares a bit behind the track and video:</p>
      <blockquote>Sean and I made this in our first session together right after we found out we were both going to be apart of Awful. We were at our engineer homie Alec’s crib and there were about 15 people coming in and out of the room all night which really contributed to the energy of the song. When you have that party element in the room, you’re really just thinking about tapping into that energy and adding to overall vibe. I wrote a hook about that person that you love that you can’t seem to get it together with… a theme a lot of us can really get behind. Linking up for the video was really just about capturing the energy of us hanging out, literally doing stupid shit cause we’re bored and tired of playing games with y’all!</blockquote>
      <p>Hanzo equally went on to share a bit about his forthcoming project and what he’s cooking up for the year ahead. “I’m currently working on a project for early 2020, as well as producing the next 6 Dogs album with the good homie Dan Hartzog,” he notes.</p>
