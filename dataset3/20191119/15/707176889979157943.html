      <h2>Arconic invokes French blocking statute in UK public inquiry and US court</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:46:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:46</time> by <a rel="author">Judith Evans</a></address>
      <p>The US metals group Arconic is declining to release documents about flammable cladding used on the Grenfell tower to a US court hearing a lawsuit from survivors and victims’ families, citing a French law limiting disclosure in foreign courts, which it has also invoked in the UK public inquiry.</p>
      <p>Arconic, a $13bn US company formerly known as Alcoa, has invoked a 1968 law passed in response to US antitrust investigations into shipping groups, known as the French blocking statute. It bars French companies and people from disclosing commercial information in foreign courts without a French court order.</p>
      <p>The US company argued in a Pennsylvania court this month that its subsidiary in France, where the cladding panels were made and sold, fell under the statute and so documents from there could not be produced to that US court — a claim contested by plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The cladding used on the tower was manufactured at Arconic’s plant in Merxheim, France, the company has told the UK inquiry into the 2017 disaster, which killed 72 people. The inquiry has already found that the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/968d470e-fbfe-11e9-a354-36acbbb0d9b6">cladding was the main reason for the rapid spread of the fire</a>.</p>
      <p>Arconic and two other companies face a wrongful-death lawsuit in Pennsylvania from survivors and the estates of many of those killed.</p>
      <p>The company told the court this month, “Because AAP SAS [Arconic’s French subsidiary, Arconic Architectural Products SAS] is a French company, many if not most of the AAP SAS documents in the database are subject to the French blocking statute.”</p>
      <p>It added that the statute “prohibits Arconic and its lawyers . . . from producing the documents of their own volition without subjecting themselves to potential prosecution”.</p>
      <p>Arconic said it had also invoked the statute in the UK public inquiry into the disaster, which will begin its second phase next year by looking at the refurbishment of the Grenfell Tower before the fire and the Reynobond PE cladding, made by Arconic, that was installed there.</p>
      <p>“AAP SAS has been working through issues with the French blocking statute with the public inquiry for phase 2,” it said.</p>
      <p>The company told the FT: “With regards to the provision of information we complied with the terms of the French blocking statute to facilitate disclosure of the required information to the UK Public Inquiry.”</p>
      <p>Arconic said documents from the French subsidiary were transferred by its lawyers, DLA Piper, to databases hosted in the US after the fire — but that the documents remained subject to the French law because they “were not sent for purposes of being produced in US litigation”.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the 247 plaintiffs in the case, including the estates of 69 people killed in the fire, have pushed back. “Plaintiffs disagree that the French blocking statute hinders Arconic’s ability and obligation to produce the responsive documents that exist in US databases in any way,” they said in court documents.</p>
      <p>They added: “US courts, including the Supreme Court, have overwhelmingly held that the French blocking statute does not in any way restrict or prohibit the discovery that a party is entitled to in US-based litigation.” They added that there had been only one recorded conviction under the blocking statute in French courts.</p>
      <p>In a 2017 story later cited in a separate lawsuit against Arconic, Reuters reported that emails sent by a staff member based at the French plant showed the company was <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-fire-arconic/arconic-knowingly-supplied-flammable-panels-for-use-in-tower-emails-idUKKBN19F05C">aware the cladding would be used on the tower</a>, despite separately warning in brochures for the Reynobond PE product that it was unsafe for use above 10 metres in height.</p>
      <p>The emails were sent in 2014 by Deborah French, then the company’s UK sales manager, during the bidding process for the Grenfell Tower refurbishment contract, Reuters reported. The company told Reuters that regulations vary by country and “need to be determined by the local building code experts”.</p>
      <p>Arconic said: “We continue to co-operate with the official UK investigations into the Grenfell Tower tragedy. In the US litigation, we are providing documents from the US companies, but we must respect French legal requirements and restrictions regarding documents from AAP SAS.”</p>
      <p>The UK public inquiry declined to comment.</p>
