      <h1>Bong Joon Ho’s Next Movie Will Mix Action and Horror</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T15:10:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 15:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/author/mrdisgusting/" target="_blank">Brad Miska</a></address>
      <p>South Korean filmmaker <b>Bong Joon Ho</b> became a household name among horror fans in 2006 when Magnolia Pictures released his action-horror <i>The Host</i>, in which a monster emerges from the river and begins attacking people.</p>
      <p>The filmmaker has always mixed genres, from his dramatic thriller <i>Mother</i> to his sci-fi actioner <i>Snowpiercer</i>, and even his dramatic Spielbergian <i>Okja</i>, which blends action, adventure and drama. However, one thing they all have in common is a heavy dose of social commentary, which continues in his award winning <i>Parasite</i>, now in theaters.</p>
      <p>While details are slim, Joon Ho tells <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/parasite-bong-joon-ho-success-next-movies-marvel-netflix-1203408123/">Variety</a> that his next will return to his roots, once again blending action and horror.</p>
      <p>“Actually, I am preparing two different projects,” he tells the site. “One is a Korean-language one, and the other one is an English-language one. Both projects are not big films. They’re the size of <i>Parasite</i> or <i>Mother</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>“The Korean film is located in Seoul and has unique elements of horror and action. It’s difficult to define the genre of my films.</blockquote>
      <p>“The English project is a drama film based on a true event that happened in 2016. Of course, I won’t know until I finish the script, but it has to be set half in the U.K. and half in the U.S.”</p>
      <p>Bong Joon Ho’s <i>Parasite</i> is easily one of the best films of the year and follows a family who just wants a taste of the good life, only to have it go horribly wrong. Bloody Disgusting’s own Serena Fischer attended the premiere and <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3564820/cannes-review-parasite-bong-joon-ho-gets-skin/">wrote about how <i>Parasite</i> gets under your skin.</a> “<i>This film will stick with you long after the end credits roll and remain under your skin, much like its title implies</i>,” she wrote in her review for us. It’s currently in theaters everywhere and heavily included in early awards buzz.</p>
