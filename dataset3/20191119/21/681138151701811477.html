      <p>The Suffolk club, who are 15 points clear at the top, ahead of nearest rivals Wroxham, have recruited front-runner Bowditch on a deal until the end of the season - a major coup.</p>
      <p>Former Ipswich Town star Bowditch, who made 72 league appearances for Town between 2002 and 2009, could make his Stow debut at home to Mildenhall Town this Saturday.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old, who also played for Yeovil, MK Dons (227 first-team games) and Northampton during a distinguished professional career, was released by the Cobblers last summer.</p>
      <p>Bowditch made his Town debut as a 16-year-old in an East Anglian derby, as a 71st minute substitute in a 2-0 victory at Norwich City in March, 2003. He made 419 league games during his professional career.</p>
