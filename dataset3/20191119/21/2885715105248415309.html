      <p>A forensic expert deposing in the Sheena Bora murder case on Tuesday submitted before the court that he had concluded, after DNA analysis, that the samples of the femur bone and cervical vertebrae bone belonged to accused Indrani Mukerjea’s daughter.</p>
      <p>The 59th witness to depose in the case, Shrikant Lade told the court that he was attached to the DNA department of the Forensic Science Laboratory in Kalina from 2007 to 2016. He also told the court that he had received sealed parcels containing a femur bone and four lower cervical vertebrae. After DNA analysis concluded that Indrani Mukerjea is “the biological mother of the DNA of the cervical vertabrae bone and femur bone”.</p>
      <p>The witness also told the court that of other samples, including three pair of shoes, ear tops and two earth samples, “no amplifiable DNA profile” could be obtained. He also told the court that the second DNA of another femur bone and tooth had concluded that “no interpretable DNA profile” could be found.</p>
