      <p>In a surprise move, the Congress has sought the intervention of Union Home Minister Amit Shah to initiate a CBI probe into the death of two sisters at Walayar in which the accused were being allegedly shielded by the CPI(M)-led LDF government. Congress MP Kodikummil Suresh raised the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha. The case relates to the mysterious death and sexual exploitation of two minor Dalit siblings at Walayar in Palakad in 2017. IANS</p>
      <p>Raising the issue during zero hour in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, Congress MP from Mavelikara Kodikummil Suresh said the investigation was manipulated by the police to favour the culprits who sexually assaulted the siblings aged, 9 and 11. They were later found dead.</p>
      <p>The Congress sought a CBI investigation to unravel the “deep-rooted conspiracy”, ostensibly ignored by the police.</p>
      <p>While Mr. Shah was not present in the House when the issue was raised, his deputy, G. Kishan Reddy was later seen discussing the matter with the Congress leader. Speaker Om Birla said the matter was serious and the House would look into it.</p>
