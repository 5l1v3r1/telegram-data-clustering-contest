        <i>Outstanding conditions for growth topped by finds of exceptionally rare species around the UK</i>
      </p>
      <p>This has been a magical season for fungi. The weather has been outstanding, with a wet early spring, warm summer and autumn drenched in rain.</p>
      <p>And although fungi are not plants, most depend for mutual nourishment on plants and trees, which also had a good growing season. Even the recent drop in temperatures has helped to trigger the growth of mushrooms and toadstools, the fruiting bodies of fungi.</p>
      <p>There have also been some finds of exceptionally rare fungi. The fabulous exotic violet coral fungus looks like something from a tropical coral reef and was found on the Llyn peninsula, Gwynedd. “It’s the first time I’ve seen it in about 10 years,” said Trevor Dines of the plant charity Plantlife.</p>
      <p>Another uncommon species was the devil’s fingers fungus found in the Malvern hills on the Herefordshire-Worcestershire border. This fungus looks like a sea creature with striking pink-purple “tentacles” covered in stinking goo. The stench attracts insects to the tentacles where the spores lie, and which are picked up and spread by the insects.</p>

      <p>The fungus originally came from Australia and New Zealand and appeared in France in 1914, possibly carried in military equipment during the first world war; it was first discovered in England in 1946.</p>
