      <h1>Plastic in packaging food items by MNCs faces no ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/annapurna-singh" target="_blank">Annapurna Singh</a></address>
      <p>The Centre has prohibited the use of sachets for storing, packaging or selling gutkha, tobacco and pan masala under the plastic ban law but the packaging of chips, salted items and noodles by multi-national companies face no such ban.</p>
      <p>In a written response to a Lok Sabha question, Minister for Chemical and Fertiliser D V Sadananda Gowda said the sachets made of plastic material for storing, packing or selling gutkha, tobacco and pan masala have been prohibited according to the Plastic Waste Management Rules of 2016.</p>
      <p>The rule also prohibits the use of carry bags made of virgin or recycled plastic less than 50 microns in thickness.</p>
      <p>To a question on whether the ban stands on the packaging of chips and other edibles marketed by multinational companies, the minister said, the producers, importers and brand owners have to work out modalities for waste collection system based on the principle of Extended Producer Responsibility.</p>
      <p>The packaging material for both tobacco and chips contain a mix of plastic and paper. Food items use an aluminium layer in addition to that. The government rule mandates local bodies, gram panchayats, waste generators, retailers and street vendors to manage plastic waste.</p>
