        <li><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/vizio">Vizio</a> is rolling out an update in early December for the built-in Chromecast media streamer in its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/smart-tvs">smart TVs</a> that will let Android users stream content from the <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111919_vizio-smart-tvs-disney-plus-chromecast-update-android-casting&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> streaming service.</li>
        <li>Previously, Android users had no option to stream <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/disney">Disney</a> Plus on their smart TVs, as the Disney Plus app is still absent, and the built-in Chromecast media streamer did not support casting for <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111919_vizio-smart-tvs-disney-plus-chromecast-update-android-casting&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a>.</li>
        <li>At launch, Vizio owners who use Apple iOS devices had the option to stream Disney Plus with Apple’s AirPlay 2 casting system.</li>
        <li>Apple users will also be able to cast <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111919_vizio-smart-tvs-disney-plus-chromecast-update-android-casting&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> from their iOS devices after the Chromecast update. It will be an additional option for iOS users in addition to AirPlay 2.</li>

      <p>Vizio will roll out an update in early December for the built-in Chromecast media streamer in its smart TVs that will let Android and Apple users stream the Disney Plus app on their TVs, according to <a href="https://support.vizio.com/s/article/Disney-App-EXT?language=en_US">Vizio’s support page</a>.</p>
      <p>Vizio says: “A Chromecast built-in update that will allow you to watch Disney+ on your VIZIO SmartCast TV will start rolling out in early December.”</p>
      <p>With the new update, Apple and Android users can use the built-in Chromecast’s casting feature to stream <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111919_vizio-smart-tvs-disney-plus-chromecast-update-android-casting&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> content. It’s the only option for Android users, and one of two options for iOS users.</p>
      <p>When Disney Plus was released earlier in November, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/disney-plus-not-working-vizio-smart-tvs-chromecast-2019-11">Vizio smart TV owners found out the hard way</a> that the Disney Plus app wasn’t available on their TVs. It simply wasn’t an option when Disney’s streaming service launched, and there seemingly wasn’t much warning.</p>
      <p>Apple device owners had the option to download the Disney Plus app on their Apple devices and stream content over AirPlay 2, but Android users had no such option.</p>
      <p>As for the Vizio smart TV version of the app that will run natively from a Vizio smart TV, the company says, “We are working closely with Disney and hope to announce the availability of the Disney+ app on VIZIO SmartCast TVs soon.”</p>
      <p>Vizio previously declared in its support page that the <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=newsroom_affiliate_111919_vizio-smart-tvs-disney-plus-chromecast-update-android-casting&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> app would become available in 2020, but that timeline has since been removed from the support page.</p>
