      <p><b>MONROE, Mich.Â (AP)</b> - Two police officers were shot and wounded Tuesday as they investigated a reported assault at an apartment complex in southeastern Michigan, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Both officers were shot in the legs as they responded about 9 a.m. to a call about an assault involving a man working at the complex and a resident, who had a holstered handgun, Monroe police Chief Charles McCormick said.</p>
      <p>State police are investigating. Lt. Brian Oleksyk said there was a physical confrontation between the maintenance employee and the 40-year-old resident before police arrived.</p>
      <p>Oleksyk said the suspect fired the first shots at the two officers, according to WTOL-TV.</p>
      <p>Two other Monroe officers arrived and shot the suspect, who was in surgery Tuesday afternoon, he said.</p>
      <p>Jona Feketia, another resident, said maintenance staff told her a worker had gone to the man's apartment to do some type of spraying.</p>
      <p>"They had to do the work order. ... The guy started acting a little strange," Feketia told reporters. "He does carry a weapon. They came out and called the police."</p>
      <p>One of the officers has been released from a hospital, according to McCormick. The second officer still was being treated.</p>
      <p>One is a supervisor with more than 17 years at the police department. The other has about three or four years with Monroe police.</p>
      <p>"It's a call you never want to get," McCormick said of receiving notification about the officers being shot. "Thankfully, they're all going home. Bad things happen everywhere, unfortunately."</p>
      <p>A nearby school temporarily was placed on lockdown following the shooting.</p>
      <p>Monroe is 38 miles (60 kilometers) southwest of Detroit and just northeast of the state line with Ohio.</p>
