      <p>A school bus driver convicted of driving while intoxicated blamed her erratic driving on a ‘bad doughnut.’</p>
      <p>Linda Sue Godejohn, 55, was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated after a witness saw her recklessly driving a school bus with children on board in Houston, Texas in March.</p>
      <p>The witness told police that Godejohn took a turn so sharp that she nearly caused the bus to roll over.</p>
      <p>Godejohn was stopped by police and ‘flunked miserably’ on a field sobriety test, but later told KHOU-TV that she seemed intoxicated because of a bad doughnut she had eaten earlier in the day.</p>
      <p>‘I don’t drink. I have not drank in years…I had ate, got something from the school to eat that had made me sick…a doughnut,’ Godejohn told reporters.</p>

      <p>‘My stomach was just hurting so bad that my wheel fell of the thing, the curb. That’s all it was, and going 45 mph, it’s going to whip back,’ she continued.</p>

      <p>Godejohn said she failed the field sobriety test ‘because it’s hard,’ adding that she ‘couldn’t even do it right now.’</p>
      <p>Constable Mark Herman said: ‘We responded, I think we were in there in just a few minutes. We were able to see the bus pulled into a private parking lot, letting kids off the bus.’</p>
      <p>‘We ended up getting the bus driver out of the bus, giving her a field sobriety test, which she flunked miserably, and she was immediately place into custody,’ Herman continued.</p>
      <p>Toxicology tests later found no evidence of alcohol in Godejohn’s blood – but it did find numerous prescription drugs including 7-aminoclonazepam, clonazepam, meprobamate and carisoprodol, according to <a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/2019/11/19/bus-driver-who-blamed-erratic-driving-on-bad-doughnut-pleads-guilty-to-dwi/">Click2Houston</a>.</p>
      <p>Conezapam and meprobamate are prescription anxiety medications. Carisprodol is a muscle relaxant.</p>
      <p>Godejohn took a plea deal on November 14 that saw her plead guilty to felony DWI in exchange for two years’ probation and a $500 fine, <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-area-school-bus-driver-pleads-guilty-to-14845823.php">the Houston Chronicle reported.</a></p>
      <p>Before taking the plea deal, Godejohn was facing a maximum of two years in jail and a possible fine of up to $10,000.</p>
