      <h1>How to get your Google Stadia code, set up, and claim your Stadia name</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:32:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/nexusben1/" target="_blank">Ben Schoon</a></address>
      <p>Google Stadia has arrived! At least, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/19/stadia-founders-edition-shipping/">it has for early adopters</a>. If you’re getting in on Stadia early, here’s how to get your invite code from Google, set up your account, and claim your Stadia name.</p>
      <h3>Where to find your Google Stadia invite code</h3>
      <p>Google is <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/19/stadia-founders-invite-codes-not-arriving/">having some trouble getting invite codes</a> to everyone in a timely manner, but once your code arrives it’s easy enough to find. Google is sending out Stadia codes to the email address which you purchased your Founder’s Edition or Premiere Edition bundle with from the Google Store.</p>
      <p>To find that email once it has arrived, search your inbox for the subject line “It’s time to join Stadia!.” Within, you’ll find your invite code. This code, notably, can <i>only</i> be redeemed from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.stadia.android">Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1471900213">iOS</a> Stadia applications.</p>

      <h3>How to set up your Stadia account &amp; claim your name</h3>
      <p>Once you’ve unlocked your Stadia account using the invite code, it’s time to set up your account. Importantly, the email address you bought the Stadia Founder’s Edition with doesn’t have to be the same one you use with the service. Once you have that code, it will work with any Google account <i>as long as </i>it’s not a G Suite account.</p>

      <p>After you’ve picked an account and accepted the terms &amp; conditions, you can pick an avatar and claim your Founder’s Stadia Name.</p>

      <p>At this point, your Stadia account is mostly set up. The next step is to adjust your privacy settings. You can select who can send you friend requests. You can also select who details about you are seen by other Stadia players. Your friends list, games &amp; achievements, online status, and actively playing games status too. Finally, you’ll be able to restrict who can send you a voice chat, party, or game invite. All of these can be set to no one, friends, friends and their friends, and all players.</p>

      <p>After your account has been set up, Google will also prompt you to start your “free” trial of Stadia Pro. Those who purchased the Founder’s or Premiere Edition bundles will get this three-month trial which starts on the day they sign up. Notably, Google <i>will</i> charge you monthly after the trial ends.</p>
